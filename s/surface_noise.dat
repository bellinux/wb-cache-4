Estimates of three idealised test cases show that surface roughness could produce a relatively high noise level and enhance the trailing-edge noise somewhat. Roughness height and roughness density are two significant parameters which affect <b>surface</b> roughness <b>noise,</b> with roughness height having the more dominant effect.

25|$|Because of {{the nature}} of the {{recording}} medium, playback of many cylinders can cause degradation of the recording. The replay of cylinders diminishes their fidelity and degrades their recorded signals. Additionally, when exposed to humidity, mold can penetrate cylinders' surface and cause the recordings to have <b>surface</b> <b>noise.</b> Currently, the only professional machine manufactured for the playback of cylinder recordings is the Archéophone player, designed by Henri Chamoux.

25|$|Vinyl's lower <b>surface</b> <b>noise</b> {{level than}} shellac was not forgotten, nor was its durability. In the late 1930s, radio {{commercials}} and pre-recorded radio programs {{being sent to}} disc jockeys started being pressed in vinyl, so they would not break in the mail. In the mid-1940s, special DJ copies of records started being made of vinyl also, for the same reason. These were all 78rpm. During and after World War II, when shellac supplies were extremely limited, some 78rpm records were pressed in vinyl instead of shellac, particularly the six-minute 12-inch (30cm) 78rpm records produced by V-Disc for distribution to United States troops in World War II. In the 1940s, radio transcriptions, which were usually on 16-inch records, but sometimes 12-inch, were always made of vinyl, but cut at rpm. Shorter transcriptions were often cut at 78rpm.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, Thomas B Lambert {{was granted}} a patent that {{described}} a process for mass-producing cylinders made from celluloid, an early hard plastic (Henri Lioret of France was producing celluloid cylinders as early as 1893, but they were individually recorded rather than molded). That same year, the Lambert Company of Chicago began selling cylinder records made of the material. They would not break if dropped and could be played thousands of times without wearing out, although {{the choice of the}} bright pink color of early cylinders was arguably a marketing error. The color was changed to black in 1903, but brown and blue cylinders were also produced. The coloring was purportedly done because the dye reduced <b>surface</b> <b>noise.</b> Unlike wax, the hard inflexible material could not be shaved and recorded over, but it had the advantage of being nearly permanent.|$|E

25|$|In many cases, a dimmer can be {{replaced}} by a constant power module (CPM), which is typically a 20- or 50-ampere breaker in a dimming module casing. CPMs are used to supply line voltage to non-dimming electrical devices such as smoke machines, chain winches, and scenic motors that require constant operating voltage. When a device is powered by a CPM, it is fully energized whenever the CPM is turned on, independent of lighting console levels. CPMs must be used (in lieu of dimmers) to power non-dimming devices that require specific line voltages (e.g., in the US, 110 V, 60Hz power) in order to avoid damage to such devices. Dimmers are seldom used to control non-dimming devices because even if a dimmer channel is trusted to always operate at full power, it may not be controlled when communications are disrupted by start up and shut down of the lighting control <b>surface,</b> <b>noise</b> interference, or DMX disconnects or failure. Such a loss of control might cause a dimmer to dim a circuit and thus potentially damage its non-dimming device.|$|E

2500|$|Through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, various {{methods to}} improve the dynamic range of mass-produced records {{involved}} highly advanced disc cutting equipment. These techniques, marketed, to name two, as the CBS DisComputer and Teldec Direct Metal Mastering, were used to reduce inner-groove distortion. RCA Victor introduced another system to reduce dynamic range and achieve a groove with less <b>surface</b> <b>noise</b> under the commercial name of Dynagroove. Two main elements were combined: another disk material with less <b>surface</b> <b>noise</b> in the groove and dynamic compression for masking background noise. Sometimes this was called [...] "diaphragming" [...] the source material and not favoured by some music lovers for its unnatural side effects. Both elements were reflected in the brandname of Dynagroove, described elsewhere in more detail. It also used the earlier advanced method of forward-looking control on groove spacing with respect to volume of sound and position on the disk. Lower recorded volume used closer spacing; higher recorded volume used wider spacing, especially with lower frequencies. Also, the higher track density at lower volumes enabled disk recordings to end {{farther away from the}} disk center than usual, helping to reduce endtrack distortion even further.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports and}} {{discusses}} {{results from a}} new methodology for investigating the visually perceived properties of surfaces; by doing so, it also discovers a measurement or estimator for perceived roughness of 1 /Fβ <b>noise</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Advanced computer graphics were used to model natural looking <b>surfaces</b> (1 /Fβ <b>noise</b> <b>surfaces).</b> These were generated and animated in real-time to enable observers to manipulate dynamically {{the parameters of the}} rendered surfaces. A method of adjustment was then employed to investigate the effects of changing the parameters on perceived roughness. From psychophysical experiments, {{it was found that the}} two most important parameters related to perceived roughness were the magnitude roll-off factor (β) and RMS height (σ) for this kind of surfaces. From the results of various extra experiments, an estimation method for perceived roughness was developed; this was inspired by common frequency-channel models. The final optimized model or estimator for perceived roughness in 1 /Fβ <b>noise</b> <b>surfaces</b> found was based on a FRF model. In this estimator, the first filter has a shape similar to a gaussian function and the RF part is a simple variance estimator.

2500|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} in magnetic tape was multitrack recording, {{in which the}} tape is divided into multiple tracks parallel with each other. Analog magnetic tape recording introduces noise, usually called [...] "hiss", caused by the finite size of the magnetic particles in the tape. There is a direct tradeoff between noise and economics. Signal-to-noise ratio is increased at higher speeds and with wider tracks, and decreased at lower speeds and with narrower tracks. By the late 1960s, disk reproducing equipment became so good that audiophiles soon became aware {{that some of the}} noise audible on recordings was not <b>surface</b> <b>noise</b> or deficiencies in their equipment, but reproduced tape hiss. Before 1963, when Philips introduced the Compact audio cassette, almost all tape recording had used the reel-to-reel (also called [...] "open reel") format. Previous attempts package the tape in a convenient cassette that required no threading met with limited success. The most successful tape was 8-track cartridge used primarily in automobiles for playback only.|$|E
2500|$|In 1931, RCA Victor {{introduced}} their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as {{a material}} for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. One such was a 16-inch, rpm record {{used by the}} Vitaphone sound-on-disc movie system. In 1932, RCA began using Victrolac in their [...] "home recording" [...] system, with which people could record their own voices at home. By {{the end of the}} 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability, and low <b>surface</b> <b>noise</b> had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some Red Seal classical 78s, at a De luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic, and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce [...] "unbreakable" [...] children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{algorithm}} for accurate correction of <b>surface</b> <b>noises</b> of polygonal meshes. It consists of three basic components: (a) feature-preserving pre-smoothing; (b) partitioning of feature and non-feature regions; (c) second-order predictor for non-feature regions and median filter for feature regions. The unique contributions of our approach include (a) an idea of partitioning an input surface into feature and non-feature regions so that different smoothing algorithms, which are best suited for either feature or non-feature regions can be, respectively, applied; (b) a second-order predictor that provides higher smoothing accuracy and better convergence on smoothly curved surfaces. In comparison with several existing algorithms, our algorithm is evaluated quantitatively in terms of surface normal and vertex distance error metrics. Numerical experiments indicate the effectiveness of our approach in the aspects of convergence and accuracy. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

2500|$|Flexible or {{so-called}} [...] "unbreakable" [...] records made {{of unusual}} materials were introduced {{by a number}} of manufacturers at various times during the 78rpm era. In the UK, Nicole records, made of celluloid or a similar substance coated onto a cardboard core disc, were produced for a few years beginning in 1904, but they suffered from an exceptionally high level of <b>surface</b> <b>noise.</b> In the United States, Columbia Records introduced flexible, fiber-cored [...] "Marconi Velvet Tone Record" [...] pressings in 1907, but the advantages and longevity of their relatively noiseless surfaces depended on the scrupulous use of special gold-plated Marconi Needles and the product was not a success. Thin, flexible plastic records such as the German Phonycord and the British Filmophone and Goodson records appeared around 1930 but also did not last long. The contemporary French Pathé Cellodiscs, made of a very thin black plastic, which uncannily resembles the vinyl [...] "sound sheet" [...] magazine inserts of the 1965–1985 era, were similarly short-lived. In the US, Hit of the Week records, made of a patented translucent plastic called Durium coated on a heavy brown paper base, were introduced in early 1930. A new issue came out every week and they were sold at newsstands like a weekly magazine. Although inexpensive and commercially successful at first, they soon fell victim to the Great Depression and production in the US ended in 1932. Related Durium records continued to be made somewhat later in the UK and elsewhere, and as remarkably late as 1950 in Italy, where the name [...] "Durium" [...] survived far into the LP era as a trademark on ordinary vinyl records.

50|$|The {{composition}} of vinyl used to press records (a blend {{of polyvinyl chloride}} and polyvinyl acetate) has varied considerably over the years. Virgin vinyl is preferred, but during the 1970s energy crisis, it became commonplace to use recycled vinyl. Sound quality suffered, with increased ticks, pops and other <b>surface</b> <b>noises.</b> Other experiments included reducing the thickness of LPs, leading to warping and increased susceptibility to damage. Using a biscuit of 130 grams of vinyl had been the standard, but some labels experimented with as little as 90 grams per LP.

40|$|A three-component shallow {{reflection}} seismic {{line from}} Springbank, Alberta demonstrates large amplitude, <b>surface</b> wave <b>noise</b> {{due to the}} use of a surface energy source. Changes in phase velocity versus frequency, referred to as dispersion, of surface waves is primarily dependent on the shear wave velocities and thicknesses of the wave channels. Shear wave refraction first breaks are picked from the radial or in-line shear wave shot records. These picks are inverted with for near-surface shear wave lithology. This enabled a dispersion model to be calculated which is used to identify and interpret <b>surface</b> wave <b>noise</b> on the shot record. By summing the _o-p wavefleld transform of the vertical and radial component on a shot consistent basis the dispersion curve can be observed directly. The change in phase velocity with frequency can be approximated by a linear frequency modulated (LFM) wave over the frequency bandwidth of the Rayleigh waves. An offset varying compression operator is cross-correlated with each trace in the shot _gather before multi-channel filtering to remove linear dispersion. This reduces dispersed surface waves to a single aliased dip which is more easily removed by the 2 -D median f-k filter. The output is then uncompressed by flipping the operator in time and again cross-correlating. This hybrid multichannel filter is applied to a synthetic shot record contaminated with LFM noise at a bandwidth of 8 - 30 hz with velocity bounds of 230 - 800 m/s. The f-k domain representation of the synthetic shot record has a single focused dip of 520 m/s after LFM compression. This enables better removal of dispersive noise by the multichannel filters such as the velocity f-k or median f-k. This new filter is applied to the real three-component data set. The results indicate {{that the best way to}} minimize <b>surface</b> wave <b>noise</b> in shallow reflection studies is through careful choice of the acquisition parameters to ensure the target events are within the optimum offset window. In this example, the ground roll filtering is unable to recover the underlying reflection signals within the <b>surface</b> wave <b>noise.</b> The best CDP stack obtained for the P-wave data is due to an inside or near offset mute to completely remove the Rayleigh waves from the shot records before stacking. 6...|$|R
