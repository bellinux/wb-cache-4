5|$|Gross {{movement}} – such as locomotion and {{the movement}} of arms and legs – is generated in the motor cortex, divided into three parts: the primary motor cortex, found in the prefrontal gyrus and has sections dedicated to the movement of different body parts. These movements are supported and regulated by two other areas, lying anterior to the primary motor cortex: the premotor area and the <b>supplementary</b> <b>motor</b> <b>area.</b> The hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other body parts, allowing finer movement; this has been visualised in a motor cortical homunculus. Impulses generated from the motor cortex travel along the corticospinal tract along the front of the medulla and cross over (decussate) at the medullary pyramids. These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves. The cerebellum and basal ganglia, play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements. Connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia control muscle tone, posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system.|$|E
25|$|Word {{generation}} (phonemic verbal fluency) {{has also}} led to larger foci of brain activation for the least fluent language(s) within multilinguals (observed using fMRI). Regardless of language, however, activation is principally found in the left prefrontal cortex (inferior frontal, middle frontal, and precentral gyri). Additionally, activation {{can be observed in}} the <b>supplementary</b> <b>motor</b> <b>area</b> and parietal lobe. This activation is larger for L3 than L2 and L1, and less for L1 than for L2. Familiarity with a language reduces the brain activation required for its use.|$|E
25|$|Some {{retrograde}} and anterograde amnesics {{are capable}} of non-declarative memory, including implicit learning and procedural learning. For example, some patients show improvement on the pseudorandom sequences experiment as healthy people do. Therefore, procedural learning can proceed independently of the brain system required for declarative memory. According to fMRI studies, the acquisition of procedural memories activates the basal ganglia, the premotor cortex and the <b>supplementary</b> <b>motor</b> <b>area,</b> regions which are not normally associated {{with the formation of}} declarative memories. This type of dissociation between declarative and procedural memory can also be found in patients with diencephalic amnesia such as Korsakoff's syndrome. Another example demonstrated by some patients, such as K.C. and H.M, who have medial temporal damage and anterograde amnesia, still have perceptual priming. Those patients did well in the word fragment completion test.|$|E

40|$|Although the <b>supplementary</b> and pre-supplementary <b>motor</b> <b>areas</b> {{have been}} {{intensely}} investigated {{in relation to}} their motor functions, they are also consistently reported in studies of auditory processing and auditory imagery.

We argue here for the engagement of <b>supplementary</b> <b>motor</b> <b>areas</b> across a variety of sound categories, including speech, vocalizations, and music, and we discuss how our understanding of auditory processes in these regions relate to findings and hypotheses from the motor literature.

25|$|Language {{comprehension}} {{research on}} bilinguals used fMRI techniques. Groups of two orthographically and phonologically outlying languages (English and Mandarin) were {{the basis of}} analysis. Sentence comprehension was measured through visually presented stimuli, showing significant activation in several key areas: the left inferior and middle frontal gyri, the left superior and middle temporal gyri, the left temporal pole, the anterior <b>supplementary</b> <b>motor</b> <b>area,</b> and bilateral representation of the superior parietal regions and occipital regions. Also, brain activation of these two orthographically and phonologically outlying languages showed striking overlap (i.e. the direct contrast did not indicate significant differences). Single word comprehension using L1 generated greater activation in the temporal pole than comprehension of words in L2. Language comprehension studies of bilinguals using neuroimaging give more conclusive results than production studies.|$|E
25|$|Speech {{production}} is {{process by which}} a thought in the brain is converted into an understandable auditory form. This is a multistage mechanism that involves many {{different areas of the}} brain. The first stage is planning, where the brain constructs words and sentences that turn the thought into an understandable form. This occurs primarily in the inferior frontal cortex, specifically in an area known as Broca's area. Next, the brain must plan how to physically create the sounds necessary for speech by linking the planned speech with known sounds, or phonemes. While the location of these associations is not known, it is known that the <b>supplementary</b> <b>motor</b> <b>area</b> {{plays a key role in}} this step. Finally, the brain must signal for the words to actually be spoken. This is carried out by the premotor cortex and the motor cortex.|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose-Functional MRI is a {{powerful}} tool to investigate recovery of brain function in patients with stroke. An inherent assumption in functional MRI data analysis is that the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal is stable {{over the course of}} the examination. In this study, we evaluated the validity of such assumption in patients with chronic stroke. Methods-Fifteen patients performed a simple motor task with repeated epochs using the paretic and the unaffected hand in separate runs. The corresponding BOLD signal time courses were extracted from the primary and <b>supplementary</b> <b>motor</b> <b>areas</b> of both hemispheres. Statistical maps were obtained by the conventional General Linear Model and by a parametric General Linear Model. Results-Stable BOLD amplitude was observed when the task was executed with the unaffected hand. Conversely, the BOLD signal amplitude in both primary and <b>supplementary</b> <b>motor</b> <b>areas</b> was progressively attenuated in every patient when the task was executed with the paretic hand. The conventional General Linear Model analysis failed to detect brain activation during movement of the paretic hand. However, the proposed parametric General Linear Model corrected the misdetection problem and showed robust activation in both primary and <b>supplementary</b> <b>motor</b> <b>areas.</b> Conclusions-The use of data analysis tools that are built on the premise of a stable BOLD signal may lead to misdetection of functional regions and underestimation of brain activity in patients with stroke. The present data urge the use of caution when relying on the BOLD response as a marker of brain reorganization in patients with stroke. (Stroke. 2010; 41 : 1921 - 1926. ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>motor</b> <b>areas</b> {{are located}} in both hemispheres of the {{cerebral}} cortex. Two areas of the cortex are {{commonly referred to as}} motor: the primary motor cortex, which executes voluntary movements, and; the <b>supplementary</b> <b>motor</b> <b>areas</b> and premotor cortex, which select voluntary movements. In addition, motor functions have been attributed to: the posterior parietal cortex, which guides voluntary movements, and; the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which decides which voluntary movements to make according to higher-order instructions, rules, and self-generated thoughts.|$|R
2500|$|Differential brain {{activation}} {{has been}} compared between the us of either [...] IO or BPO pantomimes. The IO pantomime activity was largely lateralized in the left hemisphere, namely in the bilateral <b>supplementary</b> <b>motor</b> <b>areas,</b> cingulate gyrus, left premotor areas, left superior parietal lobule, and the left middle and inferior frontal gyri. The BPO pantomimes activated areas bilaterally in the <b>supplementary</b> <b>motor</b> <b>areas,</b> cingulate gyrus, premotor areas, SMG and the left inferior and middle frontal gyri, and the left medial temporal gyri. The main difference observed was that IO pantomime activation was left-hemisphere lateralized and BPO pantomime activation was bilateral. These results imply that BPO pantomimes actually show greater activation than IO pantomimes (despite the prevailing conception that they are simpler), and that BPO involves the right hemisphere {{as well as the}} left hemisphere. These results could be extended as an explanation of why apraxic brain damage - usually found in left-hemisphere - leads to BPO production. This may be an indication that apraxic’s utilize their right-hemisphere in lieu of their left-hemisphere damage, and therefore produce more BPO pantomimes.|$|R

She reported sometimes watching herself move from above but remained aware of her unmoving [...] "real" [...] body. The participant reported no particular emotions linked to the experience. [...] "he brain functional changes associated with the reported extra-corporeal experience (ECE) were different than those observed in motor imagery.

2500|$|Nerve fibres in the corticospinal tract {{originate}} from pyramidal cells in layer V of the cerebral cortex. Fibres {{arise from the}} primary motor cortex (about 30%), <b>supplementary</b> <b>motor</b> <b>area</b> and the premotor cortex (together also about 30%), and the somatosensory cortex, parietal lobe, and cingulate gyrus supplies the rest. The cells have their bodies in the cerebral cortex, and the axons form {{the bulk of the}} pyramidal tracts. [...] The nerve axons travel from the cortex through the posterior limb of internal capsule, through the cerebral peduncle and into the brainstem and anterior medulla oblongata. Here they form two prominences called the medulla oblongatary pyramids. Below the prominences, the majority of axons cross over to the opposite side from which they originated, known as decussation. The axons that cross over move to the outer part of the medulla oblongata and form the lateral corticospinal tract, whereas the fibres that remain form the anterior corticospinal tract. [...] About 80% of axons cross over and form the lateral corticospinal tract; 10% do not cross over and join the tract, and 10% of fibres travel in the anterior corticospinal tract.|$|E
2500|$|A mirror neuron is a neuron that fires both when {{an animal}} acts {{and when the}} animal observes the same action {{performed}} by another. Thus, the neuron [...] "mirrors" [...] {{the behavior of the}} other, as though the observer were itself acting. Such neurons have been directly observed in primate species. Birds have been shown to have imitative resonance behaviors and neurological evidence suggests the presence of some form of mirroring system. In humans, brain activity consistent with that of mirror neurons has been found in the premotor cortex, the <b>supplementary</b> <b>motor</b> <b>area,</b> the primary somatosensory cortex and the inferior parietal cortex. The function of the mirror system is a subject of much speculation. Many researchers in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology consider that this system provides the physiological mechanism for the perception/action coupling (see the common coding theory). They argue that mirror neurons may be important for understanding the actions of other people, and for learning new skills by imitation. Some researchers also speculate that mirror systems may simulate observed actions, and thus contribute to theory of mind skills, while others relate mirror neurons to language abilities. However, to date, no widely accepted neural or computational models have been put forward to describe how mirror neuron activity supports cognitive functions such as imitation. There are neuroscientists who caution that the claims being made for the role of mirror neurons are not supported by adequate research.|$|E

2500|$|Starting from cercopithecidae, the {{two sources}} from the basal ganglia system medial pallidum and nigra have distinct, {{spatially}} separate, thalamic territories. The pallidal territory arrives in evolution as a lateral {{addition to the}} nigal VA, forming a new nucleus individualized by another name : the nucleus ventralis oralis, VO. On the contrary {{there is no more}} VM (which receices convergent afferences in rodents and carnivora). VO receives its pallidal afferent axons from the medial pallidum. The trajectory of pallidal afferent axons is complex. Axons form first the ansa lenticularis and the fasciculus lenticularis which place the axons on the medial border of the pallidum. From there, the axons cross the internal capsule as the comb system. Axons arrives at the lateral border of the subthalamic nucleus. They pass over it as the H2 field of Forel (1877) then turn down at H and suddenly go up in H1 in direction to the inferior border of the thalamus. The distribution of pallidal axons within the territory is wide with terminal [...] "bunches" [...] (Arrechi-Bouchhioua et al. 1996,1997, Parent and Parent, 2004 [...] ). This offers few chance for a fine somatotopic organization. The territory is stained for calbindin. The mediator of the pallido-thalamic connection is the inhibitor GABA. The thalamocortical neurons send their axons to the <b>supplementary</b> <b>motor</b> <b>area</b> (SMA), preSMA, the premotordorsal and medial {{and to a lesser extent}} to the motor cortex.|$|E
2500|$|In alien hand syndrome, {{the afflicted}} individual's limb will produce unintentional {{movements}} without {{the will of}} the person. The affected limb effectively demonstrates 'a will of its own.' The sense of agency does not emerge in conjunction with the overt appearance of the purposeful act even though the sense of ownership in relationship to the body part is maintained. This phenomenon corresponds with an impairment in the premotor mechanism manifested temporally by the appearance of the readiness potential (see section on the Neuroscience of Free Will above) recordable on the scalp several hundred milliseconds before the overt appearance of a spontaneous willed movement. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging with specialized multivariate analyses to study the temporal dimension in the activation of the cortical network associated with voluntary movement in human subjects, an anterior-to-posterior sequential activation process beginning in the <b>supplementary</b> <b>motor</b> <b>area</b> on the medial surface of the frontal lobe and progressing to the primary motor cortex and then to parietal cortex has been observed. The sense of agency thus appears to normally emerge in conjunction with this orderly sequential network activation incorporating premotor association cortices together with primary motor cortex. In particular, the supplementary motor complex on the medial surface of the frontal lobe appears to activate prior to primary motor cortex presumably in associated with a preparatory pre-movement process. In a recent study using functional magnetic resonance imaging, alien movements were characterized by a relatively isolated activation of the primary motor cortex contralateral to the alien hand, while voluntary movements of the same body part included the concomitant activation of motor association cortex associated with the premotor process. The clinical definition requires [...] "feeling that one limb is foreign or has a will of its own, together with observable involuntary motor activity" [...] (emphasis in original). This syndrome is often a result of damage to the corpus callosum, either when it is severed to treat intractable epilepsy or due to a stroke. The standard neurological explanation is that the felt will reported by the speaking left hemisphere does not correspond with the actions performed by the non-speaking right hemisphere, thus suggesting that the two hemispheres may have independent senses of will.|$|E

The primary motor cortex is mainly involved in controlling kinematic and dynamic parameters of voluntary movements, whereas non-primary <b>motor</b> <b>areas</b> are more related to preparing voluntary movements in response to a variety of internal or external cues.
