Morris, who was {{fronting}} the Circle Jerks at the time, filled in for Kiedis for a show in 1986. Kiedis was off scoring drugs and missed the band's performance so they asked Morris to fill in however Morris didn't {{know any of the}} lyrics to the songs so he <b>screamed</b> <b>and</b> yelled his way through the show. Drummer Chuck Biscuits also briefly filled in on drums back in 1986.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} match, competitors Shawn Michaels and Rick Martel were unable, {{due to a}} pre-match stipulation, to hit {{each other in the}} face. The two men exchanged holds but were both preoccupied with looking to ringside for approval from Sensational Sherri. Martel gained the advantage by throwing Michaels to the outside of the ring and attacking him there. When the two returned to the ring, they took turns attempting to pin their opponent, pulling down their opponent's wrestling tights to reveal their buttocks each time. Michaels then kicked Martel and tried to pin him, but the referee stopped the three-count because Michaels' feet were on the ropes. Both wrestlers broke the pre-match stipulation by slapping each other in the face. Sherri pretended to faint, which drew the attention of both wrestlers. Michaels and Martel argued over who would carry Sherri backstage, with each man carrying her a few feet before being stopped by his opponent. Both wrestlers were counted out, but they continued to argue. Martel tried to revive Sherri by throwing water on her, but he hit Michaels as well. Michaels dropped Sherri and chased Martel backstage; upset at being left behind by both men, Sherri <b>screamed</b> <b>and</b> cried as she walked backstage.|$|E

Cosby's lawsuit accuses Johnson of lying about the incident in which she says Cosby spiked a cup of cappuccino with an unknown drug. Realizing what was happening, Johnson said she <b>screamed</b> <b>and</b> cursed at him several times before Cosby dragged her out and hailed a cab for her.

25|$|Sludge doom (also {{known as}} sludge metal) is {{a style that}} {{combines}} doom metal and hardcore punk, and sometimes southern rock. Many sludge bands compose slow and heavy songs that contain brief hardcore passages. However, some bands emphasise fast tempos throughout their music. The string instruments are heavily distorted and are often played with large amounts of feedback to produce an abrasive, sludgy sound. Drumming is often performed in typical doom metal fashion, but drummers may employ hardcore d-beat or double-kick drumming during faster passages. Vocals are usually shouted or <b>screamed,</b> <b>and</b> lyrics often focus on suffering, drug abuse, politics and anger towards society. The style was pioneered in the early late 1980s by the Melvins, and in the 1990s by bands such as Eyehategod, Crowbar, Buzzov*en, Acid Bath and Grief.|$|E
25|$|Horton's article {{includes}} an account by Shaker Aamer, a detainee and legal resident of Britain. His lawyer, Zachary Katznelson, had filed an affidavit {{in federal court}} in which Aamer said that he had been taken to the black site on 9 June 2006, where he was beaten and nearly asphyxiated. This was the same evening that the three prisoners died. Aamer said that during his interrogation, he was strapped to a chair, fully restrained at the head, arms and legs. MPs pressed on pressure points all over his body. They also inflicted pain to his eyes, bent his fingers until he <b>screamed</b> <b>and</b> then pressed against his throat and put a mask over him so he could not cry out. He said he could hardly breathe. Although Aamer was cleared for repatriation to Britain in 2009, as of 2015 he is still detained at Guantanamo, where he has been held for almost 15 years without charge or trial. He is the last British resident to be held there.|$|E

25|$|Since Reroute to Remain was {{released}} in 2002, In Flames fan base has been split because of the gradual change in style towards a more alternative metal sound. Still, In Flames have a solid and growing worldwide fanbase. The stylistic changes include <b>screamed</b> <b>and</b> clean vocals, {{as opposed to the}} death growl on the early records, more prominent rhythm section and less guitar melodies and solos, more obvious use of synthesizers and electronics and a clear influence from modern American metal in especially the uplifting chorus melodies. This later style has been mostly described as alternative metal. Since Siren Charms, and more recently their latest studio album Battles, they have more extensively used clean vocals as opposed to screams and growls and have played a softer overall sound, putting more emphasis on a melodic alternative metal direction. Very minimal elements of their earlier Melodic death metal sound are utilized at this point. However, some very mild elements of this style can still sometimes be heard in their music. Anders' clean singing style has altered drastically as it is now more prominent and he has taken on a higher-pitched vocal range.|$|E

In 1969, the Plastic Ono Band's first album, Live Peace in Toronto 1969, was recorded during the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival. This first incarnation of the group also consisted of guitarist Eric Clapton, bass player Klaus Voormann, and drummer Alan White. The first half of their performance consisted of rock standards. During the second half, Ono took to the microphone and performed an avant-garde set along with the band, finishing with music that consisted mainly of feedback, while she <b>screamed</b> <b>and</b> sang.|$|E

500|$|The {{album is}} {{primarily}} black metal in sound, though still retains the thrash metal, doom metal, and folk music influences of previous releases by the band.

Most of the vocals are <b>screamed</b> <b>and</b> growled, except [...] "Unchained", which features a passage with sung vocals, which Andy Synn of No Clean Signing described as having a [...] "strong Pink Floyd feel to them".

500|$|Grunge concerts {{were known}} for being straightforward, high-energy performances.

[...] While grunge lyrical themes focused on [...] "angst and rage", the audience at shows were positive and created a [...] "life-affirming" [...] attitude. Grunge bands rejected the complex and high budget presentations of many mainstream musical genres, {{including the use of}} complex digitally controlled light arrays, pyrotechnics, and other visual effects then popular in [...] "hair metal" [...] shows. Grunge performers viewed these elements unrelated to playing the music. Stage acting and [...] "onstage theatrics" [...] were generally avoided.|$|E

500|$|Historian George Herring {{argues that}} Adams {{was the most}} independent-minded of the founders. Though he aligned with the Federalists, he was {{somewhat}} a party unto himself, disagreeing with the Federalists {{as much as he}} did the Democratic-Republicans. He was often described as [...] "prickly", but his tenacity was fed by good decisions made in the face of universal opposition. Adams was often combative, which diminished presidential decorum, as Adams himself admitted in his old age: [...] " [...] I refused to suffer in silence. I sighed, sobbed, and groaned, and sometimes screeched and <b>screamed.</b> <b>And</b> I must confess to my shame and sorrow that I sometimes swore." [...] Adams' resolve to advance peace with France, rather than to continue hostilities, especially reduced his popularity. This {{played an important role in}} his reelection defeat, however he was so pleased with the outcome that he had it engraved on his tombstone. Adams spent much of his term at home in Massachusetts, ignoring the details of political patronage nursed by other office holders.|$|E
500|$|For The Beatles' second {{nationwide}} tour, {{which began}} on 9 March 1963 at the Granada Cinema in London, the group {{appeared on a}} bill headed by the American stars Tommy Roe and Chris Montez. Both US artists had already firmly established themselves in the UK singles charts: Montez's [...] "Let's Dance" [...] had reached #2 four months earlier in October 1962, and another top 10 hit, [...] "Some Kinda Fun", had recently followed; likewise Roe's [...] "Sheila" [...] had reached #3 five months previously in September 1962, and his new single, [...] "The Folk Singer", would enter the charts during the tour, going on to reach #4. Throughout the tour, however, the crowds <b>screamed</b> <b>and</b> screamed for The Beatles, {{and for the first}} time in UK history, the American stars were less popular than a UK act. While enjoying the overwhelming display of enthusiasm for them, The Beatles also felt embarrassment for the American performers at this unexpected turn of events, which persisted at every show from the first day to the last. The second tour had a duration of three weeks, and ended on 31 March 1963.|$|E
500|$|On April 20, 1973, {{while waiting}} for his mother, 52-year-old Clarnell Elizabeth Strandberg, {{to come home from}} a party, Kemper fell asleep and was then awakened by her arrival. While his mother was sitting in bed reading a book, she noticed Kemper enter her room and said, [...] "I suppose you're going to want to sit up all night and talk now." [...] Kemper replied, [...] "No, good night!", before waiting for her to fall asleep and {{returning}} to bludgeon her with a claw hammer and slit her throat with a knife. He then decapitated her and engaged in irrumatio with her severed head before using it as a dart board; stating that he [...] "put [...] on a shelf and screamed at it for an hour... threw darts at it," [...] and ultimately, [...] "smashed her face in." [...] He also cut out her tongue and larynx {{and put them in the}} garbage disposal. However, the garbage disposal could not break down the tough vocal cords and ejected the tissue back into the sink. [...] "That seemed appropriate," [...] Kemper later said, [...] "as much as she'd bitched and <b>screamed</b> <b>and</b> yelled at me over so many years." [...] He then had sex with his mother's corpse, hid it in a closet and went out to drink.
