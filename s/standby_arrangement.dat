50|$|For a long time, {{structural}} adjustment programs have been criticised for making excessive demands of austerity in the recipient country in return for financial aid. Such criticisms have been less pronounced in recent years, notably since 2009, when the IMF's SBA policies were modified to be more responsive to the recipient countries needs. An exception is perhaps Greece, which has been bordering on a Sovereign debt crisis in 2010 and 2011. The resulting pronounced cutbacks in public spending have resulted in mass protests and riots. In this case, the criticism has been increasingly directed at the requirements of Euro membership, considering {{the large amount of}} financial aid also coming from other Euro Area countries, rather than an IMF <b>standby</b> <b>arrangement.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1992, Gabon {{failed to}} settle arrears on its {{bilateral}} debt, {{leading to a}} cancellation of rescheduling agreements with official and private creditors. Devaluation of its CFA franc by 50% on 12 January 1994 sparked a one-time inflationary surge, to 35%; the rate dropped to 6% in 1996. The IMF provided a one-year <b>standby</b> <b>arrangement</b> in 1994-1995 and a three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) at near-commercial rates beginning in late 1995. Those agreements mandate progress in privatization and fiscal discipline. France provided additional financial support in January 1997 after Gabon had met IMF targets for mid-1996. In 1997, an IMF mission to Gabon criticized the government for overspending on off-budget items, over-borrowing from the central bank, and slipping on its schedule for privatization and administrative reform. The rebound of oil prices in 1999 helped growth, but drops in production hampered Gabon from fully realizing potential gains.|$|E

30|$|The same {{applies to}} the risk of regional-level disasters, for example, in the Southeast Asian region. Alternatives on whether to perform a lead-agency or a lead-partnership type of network in an {{emergency}} situation can enrich the detailed implementation of the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre), on facilitating regional <b>standby</b> <b>arrangements</b> for disaster relief and emergency response. The AHA Centre is recommended to identify the level of disasters and the remaining capacity of the government in order to determine whether it should intervene as lead agency or maintain lead partnership among national governments in managing emergency response to regional-level disasters. Lastly, as can be learned from this research, basically, the humanitarian cluster arrangement functioned with various capacities and levels of engagement between international/domestic and government/non-government actors. In the future, the various cluster arrangements should take into consideration when deciding whether the inter-cluster coordination should use lead-agency or lead-partnership type of network. Where in-country IASC exist, like in Indonesia, this consideration can be introduced to the inter-agency contingency plan managed by IASC.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} report traces all the main developments in IMF-World Bank policies in Uganda. Most {{of the material}} concerns the three IMF <b>standby</b> <b>arrangements</b> with Uganda for 1981 - 1984 and the World Bank Group's Structural Adjustment Programmes. These programmes introduced two contradictory policies at the same time. The IMF stabilization policies were aimed at reducing 'effective demand' in the economy by using the exchange rate {{as an instrument of}} retrenchment; the World Bank programmes were supposed to encourage 'growth' in the economy. The result was a chaotic economic performance which, by the end of 1984, had become inoperable. In 1986 the National Resistance Movement (NRM), after having taken power, originally condemned the IMF-World Bank policies. Soon, however, the NRM was forced to adopt the same, if not more hideous IMF and World Bank policies, which have continued to worsen the economic situation in the country. The conclusion is that, to reverse this situation, the people of Uganda must organize to regain their political initiative by intensifying the struggle for democracy at both national and grassroots levels...|$|R

In March 2006, Russia agreed to erase $4.74 billion of Algeria's Soviet-era debt during a visit by President Vladimir Putin to the country, the first by a Russian leader in half a century. In return, president Abdelaziz Bouteflika agreed to buy $7.5 billion worth of combat planes, air-defence systems and other arms from Russia, according {{to the head of}} Russia's state arms exporter Rosoboronexport. Some progress on economic reform, Paris Club debt reschedulings in 1995 and 1996, and oil and gas sector expansion contributed to a recovery in growth since 1995, reducing inflation to approximately 1% and narrowing the budget deficit. Algeria's economy has grown at about 4% annually since 1999. The country's foreign debt has fallen from a high of $28 billion in 1999 to its current level of $5 billion. The spike in oil prices in 1999-2000 and the government's tight fiscal policy, as well as a large increase in the trade surplus and the near tripling of foreign exchange reserves has helped the country's finances. However, an ongoing drought, the after effects of the November 10, 2001 floods and an uncertain oil market make prospects for 2002-03 more problematic. The government pledges to continue its efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector.|$|E
40|$|With UN {{peacekeeping}} {{activities in}} recent years having become more numerous, complex and costly, alternative means of responding to emerging crises and conflicts are being proposed and considered, along with their financial costs and funding. This paper analyzes the economic {{costs and benefits of}} recent options from a global resource point of view. It is concluded that standby forces provided by Member States to the UN, such as the multinational Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade for UN Operations (SHIRBRIG) and the more recent European Union (EU) Rapid Reaction Force (RRF), appear presently to be economically the most efficient means of providing UN peacekeeping. Standby forces, acknowledged by the UN as a feasible alternative to a UN standing army or police force, are economically the most efficient basically because they utilize more fully the existing military resources of Member States, rather than require major additional new resources for peacekeeping.

According to the Political Economy of Growth and Impoverishment in the Marcos Era, the Philippines' foreign debt rose from $360 million in 1962 to $26.2 billion by the end of 1985. Hence, just over a third of today's $77 billion external debt was contributed by the 20-year rule of the Marcos government.

40|$|An {{airborne}} {{gamma ray}} {{survey was conducted}} for the Scottish Office Environment Department of coastal and inland parts of SW Scotland to define existing background levels, to locate features worthy of further attention, and to demonstrate the emergency response capabilities of radiometric methods. Coastal areas were surveyed with 500 m line spacing. Inland areas were specified to 2 km line spacing, however {{it was possible to}} achieve 1 km line spacing in the majority of the inland zone. Fieldwork was conducted between the 1 st and 16 th February 1993. A total of over 17, 000 gamma ray spectra were recorded, using a 16 litre NaI spectrometer mounted in a helicopter flying at 50 - 75 m ground clearance and 120 kph. A total area of 3650 km 2 was surveyed in 41. 6 flying hours, from roughly 4370 line kilometres. The data were reduced in the field using standard SURRC procedures for background subtraction, stripping of spectral interferences, altitude correction, and calibration. Preliminary maps of the distribution of 137 Cs, 40 K, 214 Bi, 208 Tl, and estimated ground level gamma dose rate were produced during the fieldwork period using working calibration values derived from previous surveys. A set of core samples was collected from Wigtown Merse, Longbridgemuir and Caerlaverock merse for calibration purposes, and aerial observations were performed at these sites. Further soil sampling and ground level in-situ gamma spectrometry was performed in the summer of 1993 to investigate the applicability of the calibration to a range of upland soil types and topographical environments. These locations received peak deposition from the Chernobyl accident, are vulnerable to wet deposition, and are difficult to monitor rapidly using ground based methods. A total of 76 soil cores, subdivided into 168 separate samples was thus collected for high resolution gamma spectrometry in the laboratory. This was conducted from April to November 1993. For the terrestrial sites the aerial survey estimates based on the working calibration, were in good agreement with both in-situ gamma spectrometry and the results of core analysis. This validates the preliminary maps in these contexts, and confirms that a general calibration is sufficient for fallout mapping under emergency response conditions. On coastal salt marsh sites (merse), where aged deposits of Sellafield derived activity have accumulated, subsurface activity profiles for 137 Cs and 241 Am and the presence of superficial levels of 134 Cs were observed from the soil cores. Similar features have been observed in previous surveys. In these cases the effects of source burial {{must be taken into account}} to avoid underestimation of activity levels by both ground-based and aerial gamma spectrometry. A separate set of detailed maps for the principal merse sites was therefore prepared using a calibration factor derived from the soil cores from this context. There are prospects for developing spectral analysis procedures to account for source depth in aerial surveys. Source burial on the merse also has implications for sampling techniques, and for dose rate measurement, which would merit further consideration. The radiometric maps show clearly the distributions of each individual nuclide and indicate the contribution which individual localised features make to the overall gamma ray dose rate. Naturally occurring nuclides reflect the underlying geological and geomorphological contexts of the landscape. The main granite intrusions, most notably at Cairnsmore of Fleet, the Loch Doon Granodiorite, Glencairn of Carsphairn, the Dalbeattie granite, and Criffel Pluton are readily visible in 40 K, 214 Bi and 208 Tl maps, and control their local radiation environments. A number of areas of enhanced 214 Bi, which may reflect radon potential, were noted. A transient radon associated 214 Bi signal was observed on the west of the Wigtown peninsular during the survey. Examination of spectral data in the vicinity of Dundrennan has confirmed that there is no evidence of widespread terrestrial contamination arising from the use of depleted uranium projectiles on the range. The 137 Cs map indicates the environmental distribution of this nuclide in considerable detail. Levels of 137 Cs range from approximately 2 kBq m- 2, a level consistent with global weapons‚Äô testing fallout, from 2 - 40 kBq m- 2 on terrestrial sites affected by deposition from the Chernobyl accident, and from 40 kBq m- 2 to over 200 kBq m- 2 on tide washed pastures which have accumulated marine sediments from the Irish Sea. All three levels are represented within the survey zone, in a manner which is consistent with the findings of previous aerial surveys in adjacent areas, and with ground based studies. The main Chernobyl deposition in Dumfries and Galloway appears to have occurred between an area just east of the Nith, and Glenluce. The northern limit has not yet been defined, and there may be grounds for considering extension of the northern and particularly eastern limits of the inland survey zone. Within the survey zone the deposition pattern is complex, including both upland and lowland components. The plume trajectories for deposition inferred from these observations are oriented northwards rather than in the NW directions predicted by meteorological derived estimates. This may explain the contradiction between results from the Central Highlands and the estimated fallout patterns. The data presented here both add to previous knowledge, and serve as a baseline against which any future changes can be measured. The survey provides systematic coverage of the sedimentary and terrestrial coastal system for the first time, and has identified a number of merse sites which have accumulated radioactivity from past marine discharges from Sellafield, and which are not routinely monitored under existing Scottish Office arrangements. Some of these locations are extensive and fall within SSI‚Äôs; furthermore they are key sites for studying future deposition trends. It would seem prudent to review radiological assessments in the light of this work to ensure that the patterns of occupancy and sensitive ecologies of the merse are taken fully into account. The emergency response potential of aerial radiometrics has been clearly demonstrated in this project. It provides the only practical means of providing comprehensive environmental measurements of remote and upland landscapes on a short time scale, with an effective area sampling density some 106 - 107 times greater than soil sampling. Results are compatible with ground based approaches, and could focus ground based efforts effectively under emergency conditions. Modern approaches to data recording and analysis are able to produce maps during the survey period. National baseline mapping in Scotland, at 1 km resolution, would require less than 800 flying hours; 20 km line spacing would take roughly 40 hours of flight time. A long term programme of high resolution national baseline mapping, coupled to an emergency response <b>standby</b> <b>arrangement,</b> would provide an extremely cost effective way of preserving the capability developed since the Chernobyl accident, while producing high quality environmental data for research purpos...|$|E
40|$|In June 2015, the High-Level Independent Panel on Peace Operations {{established}} by U. N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and chaired by former East Timor President Jos√© Ramos-Horta, published its {{comprehensive review of}} U. N. Peacekeeping Operations. The Panel observed that it takes an average of six months from when a peacekeeping mission is authorized by the U. N. Security Council to when the mission is deployed. The Panel further explained that although rapid and effective deployment comes at a cost, responding more quickly saves lives and can avoid a larger, more costly response later. In its request for the Secretary-General to develop options for a new rapid-reaction capability, the Panel suggested evaluating the merits of having a small, standing U. N. force, transferring personnel and assets from other U. N. missions, and instituting national and regional <b>standby</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Each of these options, however, has been available for years, relies heavily on the political will of countries and regional organizations, and has not previously been sufficient to address the requirements of rapid deployment to new missions or crisis situations.

40|$|A {{model to}} {{quantify}} the temporal failure probability for a nuclear power station?s fleet of multiple, redundant, emergency diesel generators (EDGs) is developed and demonstrated in this thesis. The initiating event for this problem is Loss of Offsite Power (LOOP). This model calculates {{the probability that the}} load on the system overcomes (LOOP duration) the capacity of the system (time until the EDGs fail), as a means to quantify system safety margin; this concept comes from The United States Department of Energy (DOE), the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) collaboration on the ?Risk-Informed Safety Margin Characterization? (RISMC) approach. The ultimate application of this model is to quantify improved safety margin for an originally two-EDG system that has been upgraded with an additional, reinforced, FLEX diesel generator (DG). Some unique features of the Non-Recovery Integral (NRI) (main model of this thesis) are that it can account for dynamic timing of the EDG failures, model both hot and cold <b>standby</b> EDG <b>arrangements,</b> and accept time-dependent hazard function inputs for hot standby cases (when the hazard functions meet certain conditions). Nuclear industry and Standardized Plant Analysis Risk (SPAR) model data are used as inputs to the NRI to create six specific system model cases. The results from these cases are compared to see how different EDG arrangements affect the overall system reliability. The three main conclusions drawn from the various result comparisons are the following: (1) adding a FLEX DG to an originally two-EDG system makes the system three times less likely to fail for LOOP durations of 24 hours (further improvement in system reliability is seen for longer LOOP durations); (2) the specific model of load placed on the system has a major impact on the system failure probability quantification; and (3) {{the most effective way to}} increase safety margin (for the most likely LOOP duration scenarios) is to reduce the likelihood of common-cause failure events...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} how the African Union (AU) has handled Africa's {{peace and security}} challenges since 2002, defines what has been successful and what remains aspirational. It does so by examining how the AU has responded, from using sanctions against coups, to deploying peacekeeping missions and mediating in conflicts. An African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) has developed since 2002, including a Peace and Security Council, an African Standby Force, a Continental Early Warning System and a Panel of the Wise. This sounds impressive, but the operationalization record is patchy: AU-deployed missions have been fully dependent on external donors; harmonization is a major problem; serious questions remain over AU capacity; {{and some of the}} Regional Economic Communities (RECs) are developing at a quicker pace than the AU. Given these circumstances and its internal capacity deficit, the AU will likely struggle to exercise oversight of regional processes, including the development of regional <b>standby</b> force <b>arrangements.</b> APSA is clearly based on a liberal peace model, yet democratic systems, respect for human rights and good governance aren't always in place in African countries, and the self-interest of elites continues to be a constraint on APSA and its success. Over the last decade the AU has found a voice and, despite some setbacks, it has shown through AMISOM in Somalia that it is capable of conducting a successful peacemaking operation. Its biggest challenge is not making the decision to intervene or deploy forces, but the capacity of most African states to deploy effectively. APSA's dependence on external partners needs to diminish over the next decade if better African solutions are to be found to peace and security challenges in the continent. Yet, the internationalized nature of crises such as the one in Mali in 2012 ‚Äì 13 requires international partnerships.
