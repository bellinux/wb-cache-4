40|$|<b>The</b> {{knowledge}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universe surrounding us, nevertheless <b>the</b> big <b>steps</b> forward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last <b>decade,</b> {{presents a}} lot of obscure or not well understood parts, that are usually indicated with the adjective dark. These parts touch every component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universe: we have well known radiation in form of photons, and its dark counterpart in form of neutrinos, dark matter beside the ordinary (baryonic) matter and also an obscure form of energy whose nature is completely unknown. In this context <b>the</b> big challenge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next generation cosmology is to determine <b>the</b> intrinsic properties <b>of</b> these exotic components by working on available observables and by determining new ways {{to look at our}} Universe. Astrophysicists and Cosmologists developed during the years different techniques to observe <b>the</b> sky, some <b>of</b> which focus on <b>the</b> static properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universe (distances and topology, actual composition), while others point towards a description of its dynamics (evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> components' perturbations, expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> background and so on). As we will see in detail in this thesis, the general relativity that rules the Universe evolution works in such a way to link statical and dynamical behaviour. This feature gives the Cosmologists the possibility to infer dynamical properties starting from simple geometrical measurements, and this, in last analysis, leads to development of new techniques to study directly also <b>the</b> evolutionary part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cosmo. We already have some measurements of this kind, but the best is to come with recently developed experiments that started in <b>the</b> last couple <b>of</b> years or that should start soon. This kind of observations will concentrate on precise and complete dynamical data that hopefully will lead us to comprehend also <b>the</b> darkest part <b>of</b> our knowledge: <b>the</b> dark energy. My Ph. D. work has been principally focused on <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark sector <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universe using all probes actually available...|$|R
