40|$|In this study, an {{experimental}} setup {{was established to}} measure the pressure drop of flow through single- and double-layer woven metal screens. Three woven metal screens with different porosities of the plain-square type were tested in this study. The Reynolds number based on the <b>screen</b> <b>wire</b> diameter ranged from Re = 111 to Re= 2890 {{and the range of}} porosity was 0. 34 to 0. 67. Based on the measured drag coefficient of the three single- and double-layer plain woven metal screens, this study indicates the drag coefficient of low porosity double-layer screen is less than twice of that of the single-layer screen if the spacing of two layers remains less than 14 times of the <b>screen</b> <b>wire</b> diameter...|$|R

50|$|The {{simplest}} sizing {{process is}} screening, or passing the particles to be sized through a screen or number of screens. Screening equipment can include grizzlies, bar <b>screens,</b> wedge <b>wire</b> <b>screens,</b> radial sieves, banana screens, multi-deck screens, vibratory screen, fine screens, flip flop <b>screens</b> and <b>wire</b> mesh <b>screens.</b> Screens can be static (typically {{the case for}} very coarse material), or they can incorporate mechanisms to shake or vibrate the screen. Some considerations in this process include the screen material, the aperture size, shape and orientation, the amount of near sized particles, the addition of water, the amplitude and frequency of the vibrations, the angle of inclination, the presence of harmful materials, like steel and wood, and the size distribution of the particles.|$|R
50|$|The Anuak people {{straddle}} {{the border}} between Western Ethiopia and Sudan. In the 1930s, the American Mission had been discussing a mission among the Anuaks for two decades, but the normal cost to establish a mission station was $20,000 (~$150,000 in 2009 dollars). Don and Lyda were willing to inaugurate the work among the Anuak people using locally-obtainable materials (with the exception of <b>screen</b> <b>wire</b> for windows). Therefore, in 1937, the McClures established their station in Akobo for $1,000. Don was a dynamic speaker and fundraiser.|$|R

50|$|Another {{problem that}} is often {{encountered}} is that the particles clump together due to the moist. This {{will result in the}} undesired particle size that is not allowed to pass through the apertures into the product stream. It is recommended that screening at less than around 5mm aperture size is normally performed on perfectly dry materials. A heated screen deck may be used to evaporate the moist in the feed. It will also break the surface tension between the <b>screen</b> <b>wire</b> and the particles. An alternative is to run the feed through a dryer before entering the high frequency vibrating screen.|$|R

Used in fluorescent tubes with high power and short length, e.g. industrial lighting tubes. Has higher voltage drop {{in comparison with}} argon and krypton.

The model, which includes a static-pressure balance calculation at compressor discharge, was exercised at conditions corresponding to 10 different screen-induced distortion patterns included in the experimental data base. The spoiled area of these patterns ranged from 30 deg to 180 deg, and the distortion screen density, or the area blocked by the <b>screen</b> <b>wire</b> per unit area of screen, varied from 26 to 69 percent. The study indicates that at the higher corrected speeds, the analytical surge lines obtained are good representations of the corresponding experimental surge lines and are independent of distortion angle or distortion angle or distortion level.

40|$|When charged {{particles}} {{pass through a}} metal pipe, they are accompanied by an image current on the metal surface. With intense short bunches passing near or even into the metal surface, the peak image current density can be very high. This current may result in substantial temperature rise on the surface, especially in high peak current, multibunch operation. In this paper, we derive an explicit formula for the surface temperature rise due to this previously unrecognized pulsed heating effect and show that this effect dominates the proposed linear coherent light source collimator spoiler and wire scanner heating. Without proper account, it can result in component and instrument failures.

30|$|Based on {{the sand}} control mechanism, {{similarity}} criterion and factors affecting the stability of borehole plastic region, a large-scale laboratory test apparatus for simulating the performance of sand control screens for gas wells was developed. A series of sand control simulation experiments were performed. Based on the particle size analysis of formation sand and geological conditions, parameters of sand control screen, such as sand retention efficiency, were investigated. By simulating formation conditions, such as pressure gradient and gas flow rate, the performance of several types of screens, including slotted <b>screen,</b> <b>wire</b> wrapped <b>screen</b> and premium composite screen that are commonly used in oilfield, was evaluated.

50|$|A window screen (also {{known as}} insect screen, bug <b>screen,</b> fly <b>screen,</b> <b>wire</b> mesh) is {{designed}} to cover {{the opening of a}} window. It is usually a mesh made of metal wire, fiberglass, or other synthetic fiber and stretched in a frame of wood or metal. It serves to keep leaves, debris, insects, birds, and other animals from entering a building or a screened structure such as a porch, without blocking fresh air-flow. Most houses in Australia, the United States and Canada {{and other parts of the}} world have screens on the window to prevent entry of flying insects such as mosquitoes, flies and wasps. In some regions such as the northern United States and Canada, screens were required to be replaced by glass storm windows in the winter, but now combination storm and screen windows are available, which allow glass and screen panels to slide up and down.|$|R
