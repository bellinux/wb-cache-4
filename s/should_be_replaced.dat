5|$|However, Prime Minister Churchill was not {{satisfied}} with Ironside's progress, {{especially with regard to}} the creation of a mobile reserve. Anthony Eden, the Secretary of State for War, suggested that Ironside <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> by General Brooke (later Viscount Alanbrooke). On 17 July 1940 Churchill spent an afternoon with Brooke and was soon convinced that they were in close agreement as to how best to defend the nation. On 19 July Brooke replaced Ironside.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the gradual}} estrangement of Brian Jones and his {{decreasing}} musical contributions – {{he had only}} appeared on two tracks on the then in-progress Let It Bleed — made a return to touring problematic. They had shelved The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus after having been upstaged by The Who. By June 1969, matters had finally come to a head and {{it was decided that}} Jones <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> for the gig.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{held that}} the {{exercises}} of discretion by the President and the Minister under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA are reviewable by the courts because the subjective test that had been adopted in the 1969 Malaysian case Karam Singh v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri (Minister of Home Affairs), Malaysia, which had been adopted locally in 1971 in Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs, {{could no longer be}} supported and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> by an objective test. Furthermore, although a court would not question the executive's decision as to what national security required, the court could examine whether the executive's decision was indeed based on national security considerations.|$|E
5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump {{followed}} in 1768, the emotionally charged experiment contrasting with the orderly scene from The Orrery. The painting, which measures 72 by 94½inches (183 by 244cm), shows a white cockatoo fluttering in panic {{as the air}} is slowly withdrawn from the vessel by the pump. The witnesses display various emotions: {{one of the girls}} worriedly watches the fate of the bird, while the other is too upset to observe and is comforted by her father; two gentlemen (one of them dispassionately timing the experiment) and a boy look on with interest, while the young lovers {{to the left of the}} painting are absorbed only in each other. The scientist himself looks directly out of the picture, as if challenging the viewer to judge whether the pumping should continue, killing the bird, or whether the air <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> and the cockatoo saved.|$|E

30|$|Equation 1, {{which was}} {{obtained}} by Khlebtsovand co-workers, {{does not depend on}} refractive index of embedding media, shape and size distribution of particles, too. So, in spite of approximate results, for exact results the constants in this equation <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>replace</b> with functions of above parameters. Considering these points in Equations 4 and 5 the accuracy and generality of these equations would increase. Note that particles with same shape have the approximately same β values.|$|R
5|$|Lieutenant General Kenney {{also became}} embroiled in the affair, having been {{informed}} by Bostock, {{and insisted on}} speaking directly to the pilots himself over Jones' protest {{that this was an}} internal RAAF disciplinary matter. During a visit to Morotai from his Manila headquarters, Kenney tried to persuade the officers to reconsider their positions, but again they refused. He agreed with Bostock that Cobby <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> by Scherger, and declared that if the pilots were court-martialled he would appear in their defence. The commander of the Australian Army's ICorps, Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead, who was at Morotai preparing for the Borneo campaign, also supported Cobby's removal. Morshead and other senior army officers were concerned that the dispute could disrupt preparations for the Australian landings in Borneo and consulted with Kenney on the matter. Jones resolved to dismiss not only Cobby but also his staff officers, Group Captains Gibson and Simms. Scherger took over as Air Officer Commanding No.1 TAF on 10May.|$|E
5|$|While {{it was a}} {{minority}} view in the 1960s, eliminative materialism gained prominence and acceptance during the 1980s. Proponents of this view, such as B.F. Skinner, often made parallels to previous pseudoscientific theories (such {{as that of the}} four humours, the phlogiston theory of combustion, and the vital force theory of life) that have all been successfully eliminated in attempting to establish their thesis {{about the nature of the}} mental. In these cases, science has not produced more detailed versions or reductions of these theories, but rejected them altogether as obsolete. Radical behaviorists, such as Skinner, argued that folk psychology is already obsolete and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> by descriptions of histories of reinforcement and punishment. Such views were eventually abandoned. Patricia and Paul Churchland argued that folk psychology will be gradually replaced as neuroscience matures.|$|E

40|$|A {{criterion}} that <b>should</b> <b>be</b> satisfied in {{the inflation}} and quintessence models is motivated from the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) by Huang. However, {{it is found}} that the criterion is inconsistent with the Holographic dark energy (HDE) and new agegraphic dark energy (NADE) models. In the note, we firstly show that in the HDE and NADE models the criterion <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> respectively by two new criterions. Secondly, we apply the new criterions indicated by WGC to survey the two models. We find that the contradiction between WGC and the NADE model is removed when the new criterion is used. In the HDE model, we find the effects of the spatial curvature and the interaction <b>should</b> <b>be</b> considered in order to match the new criterion. Comment: 11 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

25|$|Proposals {{were made}} to replace Aqueduct Bridge as early as 1901. But these {{proposals}} were delayed when the McMillan Plan was issued in 1902.

25|$|The {{new system}} of Vocational Panels used to {{nominate}} candidates for the Seanad was inspired by Roman Catholic social teaching of the 1930s, {{and in particular the}} 1931 papal encyclical Quadragesimo anno.

40|$|We {{adapt the}} {{classical}} Schaefer model of fisheries management {{to take into}} account intergenerational equity, in the line of Sumaila ([18]) and Sumaila and Walters ([19]). The resulting discount rate then is non-constant, and the planner’s preferences are time inconsistent, so that optimal solutions are not implementable. In the line of Ekeland and Lazrak ([6], [7]) we define Markov subgame perfect equilibria of the underlying sequential game. We characterize equilibrium strategies by a simple relation, and we reach a robust conclusion, namely that, {{to take into account}} intergenerational equity, the rate of time preference, δ, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>replace</b> by δ−n, where n is the rate of growth of the human population...|$|R
