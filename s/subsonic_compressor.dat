The mass flow rate swallowed by the two rotors is comparable and represents the basisfor the fouling comparison. The results show that particles tend to follow the flow by impacting on blade tipswith a higher concentration on the pressure side.

40|$|In {{literature}} {{there are}} some studies related to the fouling phenomena in transonic compressors, but, in industrial applications (heavy-duty compressor, pump stations, etc.) the <b>subsonic</b> <b>compressors</b> are widespread. It is {{of great interest to}} the manufacturer to discover the fouling phenomenon related to this type of compressor. This paper presents three-dimensional numerical simulations of the micro-particle ingestion on a <b>subsonic</b> axial <b>compressor</b> rotor carried out by means of a commercial computational fluid dynamic code. Particle trajectory simulations use a stochastic Lagrangian tracking method that solves the equations of motion separate from the continuous phase. The number of particles, sizes, and concentrations are specified in order to perform a quantitative analysis of the particle impact on the blade surface. In this paper the particle impact pattern and the kinematic characteristics (velocity and angle) of the impact are shown. Both of the blade zones affected by particle impact and the blade zones affected by particle deposition are analyzed. The particle deposition is established by using the quantity called sticking probability. The sticking probability links the kinematic characteristics of particle impact on the blade with fouling phenomenon. The results show that micro-particles tend to follow the flow by impacting at full span with a higher impact concentration on the leading edge. The suction side is affected only close to the leading edge and, at the hub, close to the trailing edge. Particular fluid-dynamic phenomena such as separation, stagnation and tip leakage vortex strongly influence the impact location of the particles.

Blades cambered to have isolated-airfoil lift coefficients of 0. 6, 1. 2, 1. 8, and 2. 4 were tested over the usable angle-of-attack range at inlet-air angles of 30 degrees, 45 degrees, and 60 degrees and solidities of 1. 0 and 1. 5.

40|$|AbstractOn {{the base}} of an assumed steady inlet {{circumferential}} total pressure distortion, three-dimensional time-dependent numerical simulations are conducted on an axial flow <b>subsonic</b> <b>compressor</b> rotor. The performances and flow fields of a compressor rotor, either casing treated or untreated, are investigated in detail either with or without inlet pressure distortion. Results show that the circumferential groove casing treatment can expand the operating range of the compressor rotor either with or without inlet pressure distortion {{at the expense of}} a drop in peak isentropic efficiency. The casing treatment is capable of weakening or even removing the tip leakage vortex effectively either with or without inlet distortion. In clean inlet circumstances, the enhancement and forward movement of tip leakage vortex cause the untreated compressor rotor to stall. By contrast, with circumferential groove casing, the serious flow separation on the suction surface leads to aerodynamic stalling eventually. In the presence of inlet pressure distortion, the blade loading changes from passage to passage as the distorted inflow sector is traversed. Similar to the clean inlet circumstances, with a smooth wall casing, the enhancement and forward movement of tip leakage vortex are still the main factors which lead to the compressor rotor stalling eventually. When the rotor works under near stall conditions, the blockage resulting from the tip leakage vortex in all the passages is very serious. Especially in several passages, flow-spillage is observed. Compared to the clean inlet circumstances, circumferential groove casing treatment can also eliminate the low energy zone in the outer end wall region effectively...|$|E
40|$|A {{flexible}} yet precise {{method for}} prescribing and modifying the blade shape and the inverse design variables in two- (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) flow is presented. It {{is based on}} B-spline functions to represent curves (in 2 D) and surfaces (in 3 D) and enables one to approximate an existing blade shape or to specify target pressure distributions (or pressure loading). The notable characteristics of B-splines including smoothness, flexibility and robustness have made them well-suited to accurately fit both the design variables and the geometry. The precision and stability of B-splines in representing the airfoil geometry has been illustrated by interpolating generic and actual 2 D airfoils. Care has been taken to enhance the representation especially in high curvature areas, e. g. LE and TE, by the proper choice of B-spline parameters. B-spline surface generation has been integrated in {{the extension of the}} present 2 D inverse design into a fully three-dimensional inverse shape design.

The second aspect is the analytical modelling of the sound transmission from the impeller outer radius through the inter-blade channels and its recombination as helical modes in the inlet duct. The propagation inside the inter-blade channels is described by a slowly-varying bent duct approach, for which a simplified description of the channel geometry is considered.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The {{objective}} of the thesis {{is to improve the}} performance prediction of axial compressors, using a streamline throughflow method (STFM) code by modelling the hub and casing wall boundary layers, and additional flow mechanisms that occur within a blade row passage. Blade row total pressure loss and deviation correlations are reviewed. The effect of Mach number and the blade tip clearance gap are also reviewed as additional loss sources. An entrainment integral method is introduced to model the hub and casing wall boundary layers. Various 1 -dimensional test cases are performed before implementing the integral boundary layer method into the STFM. The boundary layers represent an area blockage throughout the compressor, similar to a displacement thickness, but affects two velocity components. This effectively reduces the compressor flow area by altering the hub and casing radial positions at all stations. The results from the final STFM code with the integral boundary layer model, Mach number model and tip clearance model is compared against high pressure ratio compressor test cases. The blockage results, individual blade row and overall performance results are compared with published data. The deviation angle curve fits developed by Roos and Aungier are compared. There is good agreement for all parameters, except for the slope of deviation angle with incidence angle for low solidity. For the three compressors modelled, there is good agreement between the blockage prediction obtained and the blockage prediction of Aungier.

40|$|An inverse blade design method, {{applicable}} to 2 D and 3 D flow in turbomachinery blading is developed and is implemented {{for the design}} of 2 D cascades in compressible viscous flow. The prescribed design quantities are either the pressure distributions on the blade suction and pressure surfaces or the blade pressure loading and its thickness distribution. The design scheme is based on a wall movement approach where the blade walls are modified based on a virtual velocity distribution that would make the current and target momentum fluxes balance on the blade suction and pressure surfaces. The virtual velocity is used to drive the blade geometry towards a steady state shape corresponding to the prescribed quantities. The design method is implemented in a consistent manner into the unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, where an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation is used and the boundaries of the computational domain can move and deform in any prescribed time-varying fashion to accommodate the blade movement. A cell vertex finite volume method is used for discretizing the governing equations in space and, at each physical time level, integration in pseudotime is performed using an explicit Runge-Kutta scheme, where local time stepping and residual smoothing are used for convergence acceleration. For design calculations, which are inherently unsteady due to blade movement, the time accuracy of the solution is achieved by means of a dual time stepping scheme. An algebraic Baldwin-Lomax model is used for turbulence closure. The flow analysis method is applied to several test cases for steady state internal flow in linear cascades and the results are compared to numerical and experimental data available in the literature. The inverse design method is first validated for three different configurations, namely a parabolic cascade, a <b>subsonic</b> <b>compressor</b> cascade and a transonic impulse turbine cascade, where different choices of the prescribed design variables are used. The usefulness, robustness, accuracy, and flexibility of this inverse method are then demonstrated on the design of an ONERA transonic compressor cascade, a NACA transonic compressor cascade, a highly cambered DFVLR subsonic turbine cascade, and a VKI transonic turbine cascade geometries, which are typical of gas turbine blades used in modern gas turbine engine...|$|E
40|$|Most {{centrifugal}} compressors operate in conditions with negligible heat transfer (adiabatic compression). Their plant tests conditions are similar {{or close to}} adiabatic conditions. Test regulations establish measures to diminish influence of a heat transfer “compressor body – atmospheric air” to an exit temperature.

Non adiabatic compression process evidently influence on temperatures inside a flow path, gas density, velocity triangles. But this aspect of a problem is out of the discussed problem. This problem is how to define gas dynamic performance of a compressor. The author has at his disposal hot test data of a small turbocharger compressor with the impeller diameter 48 mm. Data were provided by the colleague Prof. J. Seume (Institute of Turbo machines, Hanover University, Germany) : mass flow rate, total pressures and four total temperatures: directly at compressor borders and on a distance of them. The difference of values demonstrates strong heat transfer in inlet and exit pipes. The detailed study in the Institute of Turbo machines, Hanover University has shown that compression process is sufficiently non adiabatic. Unrealistic influence of rotation speed on efficiency points on it indirectly. The author applied the Universal modeling method of Prof. Y. Galerkin to reduce test data firstly. The 5 -th generation computer programs were developed recently and successfully applied to model gas dynamic performances of <b>subsonic</b> <b>compressors.</b> The German colleagues made a supposition that measured temperature difference is very close to an adiabatic process at design RPM 202000. This performance was modeled with the standard complex of empirical coefficients. The roughness of cast surfaces was taken into account. Test data of TU SPb show that work input coefficient is linear function of a flow coefficient at an impeller exit independent of Mach number in subsonic area. The linear supposition was applied for transonic and supersonic flows as well. This procedure was applied with 6 -th generation of computer programs. The 6 -th generation program takes into account shocks and calculates losses in 3 -D impellers in quasi- 3 -D mode.

In this paper these two objectives were optimized using elitist multi objective genetic algorithm, otherwise known as NSGA-II (Non dominated sorted Genetic Algorithm-II) which was developed by Kalyan Moy Deb [2002]. Lingen Chen and Fengrui Sun (2005) implemented optimum design of a <b>subsonic</b> axial flow <b>compressor</b> stage using mean line prediction method and taking 12 design variables and three objective functions. In the present approach two objective functions were formulated taking 5 design variables into account. The results showing optimal front for the two objectives problem is presented and the sensitivity analysis results of influencing design variables are shown...|$|R
40|$|An {{aerodynamic}} inverse shape design {{method is}} implemented into ANSYS-CFX using a User Defined Function. The implementation is validated first; {{the method is}} then assessed on a <b>subsonic</b> axial <b>compressor</b> stage and a turbine stage. The design method is based on specifying a target pressure distribution over the blade suction surface (or a target pressure loading) and a blade thickness distribution as the design variables. The blade wall moves with a fictitious velocity, which is derived from a balance of design and target momentum fluxes, {{in order to reach}} a blade shape that would produce the prescribed target pressure distribution. The wall movement obtained from the design method is computed in a User Defined Function through the CFX Expression Language; it is then communicated to ANSYS-CFX at each time step. In ANSYS-CFX, a cell-centered finite volume formulation is used for space discretization. The time accurate Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations are written in an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) form so as to account for the wall and mesh movement. The k- turbulence model is used for both compressor and turbine stages. Once the UDF is validated, ANSYS-CFX is used to redesign the E/CO- 3 axial compressor stage and the E/TU- 3 axial turbine stage so as to improve the stage aerodynamic performance...|$|R
40|$|Steady tip {{injection}} {{has been}} demonstrated {{to be an effective}} means of extending the stable operating range of a tip-critical compressor. This study presents a state-of-the-art design for the tip injection through the casing with flush-mounted inclined holes and the effectiveness of steady micro-air injection to enhance stability in a <b>subsonic</b> axial-flow <b>compressor</b> rotor using an external-air supply. For the tested rotor, experimental results demonstrate that at 53 % design speed, the stalling mass flow can be reduced by 7. 69 % using an injected mass flow equivalent to 0. 064 % of the annulus flow. Time-dependent CFD simulations were conducted to identify the physical mechanic that accounts for the beneficial effects of the steady micro-air injection on the performance and stability of the compressor. Detailed analyses of the flow visualization at the tip have exposed the different tip flow topologies between the cases without tip injection and with tip injection. It was found that the primary stall margin enhancement afforded by the steady micro-air injection {{is a result of the}} tip-clearance flow manipulation. The repositioning of the tip-clearance vortex further towards the trailing edge of the blade passage and delaying the movement of incoming/tip-clearance flow interface to the leading edge plane are the physical mechanisms responsible for extending the compressor stall margin...|$|R
