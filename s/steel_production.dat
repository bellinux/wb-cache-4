5|$|The {{reputation}} of Seric iron of South India (wootz steel) amongst {{the rest of}} the world grew considerably. Metal production sites in Sri Lanka employed wind furnaces driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing high-carbon steel. Large-scale Wootz <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> in Tamilakam using crucibles and carbon sources such as the plant Avāram occurred by the sixth century BC, the pioneering precursor to modern <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> and metallurgy.|$|E
5|$|Since the 17th {{century the}} first step in European <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> has been the {{smelting}} of iron ore into pig iron in a blast furnace. Originally employing charcoal, modern methods use coke, which has proven more economical.|$|E

5|$|The war-time economy {{provided}} a boom to Indiana's industry and agriculture, {{which led to}} more urbanization throughout the 1920s. By 1925, more workers were employed in industry than in agriculture in Indiana. Indiana's greatest industries were <b>steel</b> <b>production,</b> iron, automobiles, and railroad cars.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium {{is also an}} {{environmental}} hazard. Human exposure is primarily from fossil fuel combustion, phosphate fertilizers, natural sources, iron and <b>steel</b> <b>production,</b> cement production and related activities, nonferrous metals production, and municipal solid waste incineration. Bread, root crops, and vegetables {{also contribute to the}} cadmium in modern populations.|$|E
5|$|Even though Britain led {{the world}} in <b>steel</b> <b>production,</b> the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel warships. The Bessemer process for steel {{manufacture}} produced too many imperfections for large-scale use on ships. French manufacturers used the Siemens-Martin process to produce adequate steel, but British technology lagged behind. The first all-steel warships built by the Royal Navy were the dispatch vessels Iris and Mercury, laid down in 1875 and 1876.|$|E

5|$|Ohio is {{considered}} the historical center of <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> in the U.S. The state produces annually around 14 million tons, with a $7.2 billion state economic impact.

5|$|For {{over three}} centuries during the Song Dynasty (960–1279) China {{experienced}} sustained growth {{in per capita}} income and population, structural change in the economy, and increased pace of technological innovation. Movable print, improved seeds for rice and other commercial crops, gunpowder, water-powered mechanical clocks, the use of coal {{as a source of}} fuel for a variety of industries, improved techniques for iron and <b>steel</b> <b>production,</b> pound locks and many other technological innovations transformed the economy. In north China, the main fuel source for ceramic kilns and iron furnaces shifted from wood to coal.|$|E
5|$|From about 1790 {{textiles}} {{became the}} most important industry in the west of Scotland, especially the spinning and weaving of cotton, which flourished until in 1861 the American Civil War cut off the supplies of raw cotton. The industry never recovered, {{but by that time}} Scotland had developed heavy industries based on its coal and iron resources. The invention of the hot blast for smelting iron (1828) revolutionised the Scottish iron industry. As a result, Scotland became a centre for engineering, shipbuilding and the production of locomotives. Toward the end of the 19th century, <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> largely replaced iron production.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, the {{extractive}} industries of the West of Scotland underwent a metamorphosis. The small pits were either worked out or were mechanised and merged. A similar process took place in the iron and <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> industries, and the medium scale iron works in many locations closed down. Many railway branch lines had been heavily dependent on business from the mineral industries, and could not be sustained when they had gone, but some continued as passenger lines where they served sizable communities.|$|E
5|$|Manganese is {{essential}} to iron and <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> {{by virtue of its}} sulfur-fixing, deoxidizing, and alloying properties, as first recognized by the British metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet (1811 - 1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of Spiegeleisen, into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus in order to improve its malleability. Steelmaking, including its ironmaking component, has accounted for most manganese demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand. Manganese is a key component of low-cost stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|Modern steels {{are made}} with varying {{combinations}} of alloy metals to fulfill many purposes. Carbon steel, composed simply of iron and carbon, accounts for 90% of <b>steel</b> <b>production.</b> Low alloy steel is alloyed with other elements, usually molybdenum, manganese, chromium, or nickel, in amounts of up to 10% by weight to improve the hardenability of thick sections. High strength low alloy steel has small additions (usually < 2% by weight) of other elements, typically 1.5% manganese, to provide additional strength for a modest price increase.|$|E

5|$|Sheffield {{remained}} a major industrial city throughout {{the first half}} of the 20th century, but the downturn in world trade following the 1973 oil crisis, technological improvements and economies of scale, and a wide-reaching restructuring of <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> throughout the European Economic Community led to the closure of many of the steelworks from the early 1970s onward. Urban and economic regeneration schemes were initiated in the late 1980s. The city centre was blighted by empty shops and improvements were halted by the Great Recession.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} oxidizers like sodium nitrate {{are added to}} enhance the reaction. The result is {{aluminium}} oxide and ferroniobium, an alloy of iron and niobium used in the <b>steel</b> <b>production.</b> Ferroniobium contains between 60 and 70% niobium. Without iron oxide, the aluminothermic process is used to produce niobium. Further purification is necessary to reach the grade for superconductive alloys. Electron beam melting under vacuum is the method used by the two major distributors of niobium.|$|E

In the regions with strong traditions of metallurgy, the <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> actually increased during this period.

5|$|The {{causes of}} Bolckow, Vaughan's failure included: poor {{decision-making}} {{in the period}} from 1900–1910 which delayed the introduction of improved steelmaking technology; optimistic belief in promises of funding made by the British government during the war, leading to excessive reliance on costly bank loans in 1918, instead of issuing share capital (as the firm later did in 1919 and 1923); failure to diversify into profitable steel products such as pipes, sheet steel and shipbuilding plates; and failure to invest in its own coal mines to provide enough for <b>steel</b> <b>production,</b> and for cash. There were thus both long-term and short-term failures of strategy.|$|E
