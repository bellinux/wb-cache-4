50|$|The <b>Syrian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> was a grazer. It fed on grass, herbs, leaves, {{shrubs and}} tree branches.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Syrian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> {{lived in}} deserts, semideserts, arid grasslands and {{mountain}} steppes. Native to West Asia, {{they were found}} in Palestine, Jordan, Turkey, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iraq.|$|E
50|$|<b>Syrian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> were preyed upon by Asiatic lions, Arabian leopards, striped hyenas, {{grey wolves}} and Caspian tigers. Asiatic cheetahs may have preyed on onager foals.|$|R
50|$|Based {{on ancient}} drawings, the Atlas <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> had stripes on its legs {{as well as}} a {{shoulder}} cross. Of the living subspecies of African <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> the Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> has only leg stripes, and the Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> only the shoulder stripe. One or both features appear sometimes in the domestic donkey, the domestic descendant of the African <b>wild</b> <b>asses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> {{is one of}} two {{subspecies}} of African <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> {{the other}} being the Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass.</b> Domesticated more than 6,000 years ago in northern Africa, <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> is thought to be the origin species for donkeys. The Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass's</b> remaining <b>wild</b> population of fewer than 2,000 is found in small, scattered pockets of western Africa.|$|R
50|$|Since 2003, Persian onagers {{have been}} {{introduced}} in Saudi Arabia, where the <b>Syrian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> once lived. Introduced Persian onagers live in deserts foraging on grasses and branches or woodier plant material in dry seasons.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Syrian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus hemionus hemippus), less {{commonly}} known as an achdari or hemippe, or Mesopotamian onager or Syrian onager is an extinct subspecies of onager native to the Arabian peninsula. It ranged across present-day Syria, the Palestinian territories, Israel, Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Iraq.|$|E
50|$|From ancient times, Azraq, ecologically, was a {{continuation}} of Africa. In this time period, many animals often characterized as African lived in Azraq. Among these species were the <b>Syrian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> wild camel, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, Asian elephant, gazelle, aurochs, Asiatic cheetah, Syrian ostrich, Asiatic lion, and Arabian oryx. All of these animals, except the gazelle, are now extinct in Azraq, and Jordan alike.|$|E
50|$|The Badhyz State Nature Reserve is an {{important}} stronghold of the Asiatic <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus hemionus kulan). It was once the last place where the Turkmenian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> was found. The <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> population increased from 200, when the reserve was founded to 5000 animals. After a strong decline, there are now about 650 <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> in the sanctuary.|$|R

40|$|Genetic {{data from}} extant donkeys (Equus asinus) have {{revealed}} two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups, suggestive of two separate domestication events in northeast Africa about 5000 years ago. Without distinct phylogeographic structure in domestic donkey haplogroups and with little {{information on the}} genetic makeup of the ancestral African <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> however, it {{has been difficult to}} identify wild ancestors and geographical origins for the domestic mitochondrial clades. Our analysis of ancient archaeological and historic museum samples provides the first genetic information on the historic Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus africanus africanus), Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus africanus somaliensis) and ancient donkey. The results demonstrate that the Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> was an ancestor of the first donkey haplogroup. In contrast, the Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> has considerable mitochondrial divergence from the Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> and domestic donkeys. These findings resolve the long-standing issue {{of the role of the}} Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> in the domestication of the donkey, but raise new questions regarding the second ancestor for the donkey. Our results illustrate the complexity of animal domestication, and have conservation implications for critically endangered Nubian and Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass...</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Syrian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> {{only one}} metre high at its shoulder, was the {{smallest}} form of Equidae {{and could not}} be domesticated. Its coloring changed with the seasons—a tawny olive coat for the summer months and pale sandy yellow for the winter. It was known, like other onagers, to be untameable, and was compared to a thoroughbred horse for its beauty and strength.|$|E
50|$|Iran {{lost all}} its Asiatic lions and Caspian tigers by the earlier {{part of the}} 20th century. The <b>Syrian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> has become extinct. Syrian brown bears in the mountains, wild sheep and goats, gazelles, Persian onagers, wild pigs, Persian leopards, and foxes abound. Domestic animals include sheep, goats, cattle, horses, water buffalo, donkeys, and camels. The pheasant, partridge, stork, and falcon are native to Iran.|$|E
50|$|Two onager subspecies, the Persian onager and the Turkmenian kulan {{are being}} reintroduced to their former ranges, {{including}} {{in other regions}} the <b>Syrian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> used {{to occur in the}} Middle East. The two subspecies have been reintroduced to the wild of Israel since 1982, and had been breeding hybrids there, whilst the Persian onager alone has been reintroduced to Jordan and the deserts of Saudi Arabia.|$|E
25|$|Few {{species of}} ass {{exist in the}} wild. The African <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> Equus africanus, has two subspecies, the Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> Equus africanus somaliensis, and the Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> Equus africanus africanus, the {{principal}} ancestor of the domestic donkey. Both are critically endangered. Extinct species include the European ass, Equus hydruntinus, which became extinct during the Neolithic, and the North African <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> Equus africanus atlanticus, which became extinct in Roman times.|$|R
50|$|The {{wildlife}} sanctuary {{was established in}} 1972 and came under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. The sanctuary {{is one of the}} last places on earth where the endangered <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> sub-species Indian <b>Wild</b> <b>Ass</b> (Khur) (Equus hemionus khur) belonging to Asiatic <b>Wild</b> <b>Ass</b> species Onager (Equus hemionus) can be spotted.|$|R
50|$|The Atlas <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus africanus atlanticus), {{also known}} as Algerian <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> is a purported extinct {{subspecies}} of the African <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> that was once found across North Africa {{and parts of the}} Sahara. It was last represented in a villa mural ca.300 AD in Bona, Algeria, and became extinct as a result of Roman sport hunting.|$|R
50|$|After the {{extinction}} of the <b>Syrian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> the Persian onager from Iran {{was chosen as the}} appropriate subspecies to replace the extinct onagers in the Middle East. The Persian onager was then introduced to the protected areas of Saudi Arabia and Jordan. It was also reintroduced, along with the Turkmenian kulan, to Israel, where they both reproduce wild ass hybrids in the Negev Mountains and the Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve.|$|E
50|$|The Asiatic {{lion and}} cheetah, and <b>Syrian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> used to occur here, as {{evidenced}} by Islamic texts. For example, that humur (حُـمـر, 'asses' or 'donkeys') would be terrified of a qaswarah (قَـسـورة, 'lion') is mentioned in Surat al-Muddaththir of the Qur’an. There is a hadith in Muwatta’ Imam Malik about Muslim Pilgrims having to beware of the asad (أَسـد, lion) and fahd (فَـهـد, cheetah) in the land, besides other animals.|$|E
50|$|The Asian {{wild ass}} has been reintroduced to Makhtesh Ramon. In 1995 the {{population}} had increased to 40 {{adults in the}} area. The animals are hybrids of two different subspecies of the Asian Wild Ass. It {{is derived from the}} Turkmenian kulan (E. h. kulan) and the Persian onager (E. h. onager). The original subspecies, the <b>Syrian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (E. h. hemippus), is completely extinct. Other larger mammals of the area include Nubian ibexes, Dorcas gazelles, striped hyenas and few Arabian leopards.|$|E
50|$|A the {{previous}} census in 2009, estimated 4,038 Indian <b>wild</b> <b>ass.</b> However, {{the population was}} still growing. In December 2014, the population was estimated at 4,451 individuals. It has increased from a jump of 454. However, as of 2015, the current Indian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> population has increased to more than 4,800 individuals in {{and outside of the}} <b>Wild</b> <b>Ass</b> Wildlife Sanctuary of India.|$|R
50|$|First {{census of}} the <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> {{was done in}} 1940, when there were an {{estimated}} 3,500 <b>wild</b> <b>asses.</b> But, by the year 1960, this figure fell to just 362, it was then classified as a highly endangered species. In the years 1973 & 1976, Rann of Kutch and adjoining districts were taken up as the area for conservation for this sub-species also known as Khur. From 1976, the forest department began conducting the <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> census. Water holes were increased in the area, the forest department has also started a project for having fodder plots though the forest department is yet to get desired success. In 1998, the <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> population was estimated at 2,940, by the year 2004 it has increased to an estimated 3,863. A recent census conducted by forest department in 2009 has revealed that the population of <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> in the state was estimated to about 4,038, an increase of 4.53% as compared to 2004. Recently in 2015, the current census of the Indian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> population has increased to more than 4,800 individuals in {{and outside of the}} <b>Wild</b> <b>Ass</b> Wildlife Sanctuary of India.|$|R
50|$|Domestic donkeys {{found in}} Italy are {{typically}} {{descended from the}} Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> {{as opposed to those}} from other European countries where domesticated stock are usually descended from the Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass.</b>|$|R
50|$|Other than deserts, {{it lives}} in grasslands, plains, steppes, and savannahs. Like many other large grazing animals, the onager's range has {{contracted}} greatly under {{the pressures of}} poaching and habitat loss. Previously listed as Endangered, onagers have been classified as Near Threatened by IUCN in 2015. Of the five subspecies, one is extinct, two are endangered, and two are near threatened (their status in China is not well known). Persian onagers are currently being reintroduced in the Middle East as replacement for the extinct <b>Syrian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> in the Arabian Peninsula, Israel and Jordan.|$|E
50|$|The {{wildlife}} of Iraq includes its {{flora and}} fauna and their natural habitats. By the early twentieth century, Iraq had lost all of its megafauna, except for the Syrian brown bear. Prior {{to the introduction of}} gunpowder, Iraq was inhabited by many iconic animals such as the Mesopotamian lion, Caspian tiger, and Asiatic cheetah. Iraq has multiple biomes which include the mountainous Kurdistan region in northern Iraq to the wet marshlands along the Euphrates river and the west part of the country comprises desert and some semi-arid regions. As of 2001, seven of Iraq's mammal species and 12 of its bird species are endangered. The endangered species include the northern bald ibis and Persian fallow deer. The <b>Syrian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> is extinct, and the Saudi Arabian dorcas gazelle was declared extinct in 2008.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Syrian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus hemionus hemippus) {{lived in}} Israel in {{historic}} times until the 1930 s, when it {{disappeared from the}} entire Middle East region. Khulans from other subspecies (E. h. onager - six individulas and E. h. kulan - five individuals) were brought to Israel from European zoos during 1968 - 69 (the authors of project considered that onager and kulan were the same subspecies) and these animals bred together in the semi-captivity conditions of the Haibar Yotvata Reserve. Later, during a 12 -year period from 1982 through 1993, six groups totalling 38 khulans (17 males and 21 females) were realized in the Negev Desert. These groups had quite low success rates in establishing viable, breeding population following release because of several mistakes made during the project. First, all were realized during spring, which due to the local conditions of vegetation, watering places and weather in the Negev Desert, was the wrong season; late autumn and winter {{would have been much}} more suitable for this purpose. Second, many groups had too many males creating the wrong male to female ratio. Third, individuals for realizing were too adult. Fourth, groups were held in pre-release enclosures less than 5 - 6 months, which didn’t allow for acclimation and creating new social structure. And fifth, individuals were only evaluated based on genetics, while social behavioral traits were not taken into consideration. The result of these mistakes was difficulty in establishing a cohesive, stable population and an initially slow population growth. Over time, however, they became more successful, at the beginning of project, though over time it became more successful and currently there are about 100 khulans in the wild population. Asiatic wild asses are still kept in the semi-captivity conditions of the Haibar Yotvata Reserve, where they live with other ungulate species. A number of interspecific aggressive interactions between khulans and other species have been observed...|$|E
50|$|The other {{odd-toed}} ungulates in China are the Mongolian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> and the Tibetan <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (kiang). The former is endangered {{while the latter}} is not. Both are Class I protected species.|$|R
50|$|The Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus africanus somaliensis) is a {{subspecies}} of the African <b>wild</b> <b>ass.</b> It {{is found}} in Somalia, the Southern Red Sea region of Eritrea, and the Afar Region of Ethiopia.|$|R

50|$|The Asiatic <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> {{is larger}} than African <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> at about 290 kg and 2.1 m (head-body length). They are reddish-brown or yellowish-brown in color and have broad dorsal stripe on {{the middle of the}} back. Unlike most horses and donkeys, onagers have never been domesticated. They are among the fastest mammals, as they can run as fast as 64 km/h (40 mph) to 70 km/h (43 mph). The onager is closely related to the African <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> as they both shared the same ancestor. The kiang, {{formerly}} considered a subspecies of Equus hemionus, diverged from the Asiatic <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> and has been acknowledged as a distinct species.|$|R
50|$|The Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> hasn't {{been seen}} since the 1950s-70s and is presumed extinct. The last {{sighting}} of <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> in the animal's range were in Eritrea's Barka Valley and the border between Eritrea and Sudan during aerial flights in the 1970s. Similar to {{the decline of the}} Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> the Nubian <b>wild</b> ass' extinction can largely be attributed to hunting, competition with livestock for limited desert resources, and hybridization with the Domestic donkey.|$|R
50|$|The Indian <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> as {{with most}} other Asian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> subspecies, is quite {{different}} from the African <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> species. The coat is usually sandy, but varies from reddish grey, fawn, to pale chestnut. The animal possesses an erect, dark mane which runs from the back of the head and along the neck. The mane is then followed by a dark brown stripe running along the back, to the root of the tail.|$|R
40|$|Long-distance migrations of {{wildlife}} {{have been identified}} as important biological phenomena, but their conservation remains a major challenge. The Mongolian Gobi {{is one of the last}} refuges for the Asiatic <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus hemionus) and other threatened migratory mammals. Using historic and current distribution ranges, population genetics, and telemetry data we assessed the connectivity of the <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> population in the context of natural and anthropogenic landscape features and the existing network of protected areas. In the Mongolian Gobi mean biomass production is highly correlated with human and livestock density and seems to predict <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> occurrence at the upper level. The current <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> distribution range largely falls into areas below the 250  gC/m 2 /year productivity isoline, suggesting that under the present land use more productive areas have become unavailable for <b>wild</b> <b>asses.</b> Population genetics results identified two subpopulations and delineated a genetic boundary between the Dzungarian and Transaltai Gobi for which the most likely explanation are the mountain ranges separating the two areas. Home ranges and locations of 19 radiomarked <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> support the assumed restricting effects of more productive habitats and mountain ranges and additionally point towards a barrier effect of fences. Furthermore, telemetry data shows that in the Dzungarian and Transaltai Gobi individual <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> rarely ventured outside of the protected areas, whereas in the southeast Gobi asses only spend a small fraction of their time within the protected area network. Conserving the continuity of the <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> population will need a landscape level approach, also including multi-use landscapes outside of protected areas, particularly in the southeast Gobi. In the southwest Gobi, allowing for openings in the border fence to China and managing the border area as an ecological corridor would connect three large protected areas together covering over 70, 000  km 2 of <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> habitat...|$|R
