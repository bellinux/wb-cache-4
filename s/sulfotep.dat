50|$|At room {{temperature}} <b>sulfotep</b> is a colourless liquid oil. Its boiling point is only available at low pressure. Only at low pressure and high temperature <b>sulfotep</b> is {{available as a}} gas. Because of the flash point of -18 °C there is a vapor present at {{room temperature}}. The gas is heavier than air. <b>Sulfotep</b> has a garlic-like odor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfotep</b> {{is taken}} up well both orally, dermally {{as well as through}} inhalation. A few {{different}} organizations determined a maximum concentration <b>sulfotep</b> in the air. The maximum allowed concentration is 0.2 mg/m3.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sulfotep</b> (O,O,O',O'-Tetraethyldithiopyrophosphate) is a {{pesticide}} {{commonly used}} in greenhouses as a fumigative agent. The substance {{is also known as}} TEDP, Dithione, Dithiophos and many others. <b>Sulfotep</b> belongs to the class of chemicals named organophosphates. It has a cholinergic effect, involving depression of the cholinesterase activity of the peripheral and central nervous system. [...] The transduction of signals is disturbed at the synapses that make use of acetylcholine. This is the same mechanism of action as nerve agents such as VX, although <b>sulfotep</b> is significantly less potent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfotep</b> causes an {{organophosphate}} poisoning. This {{means that}} it {{had an effect on}} the activity of cholinesterase. There are differences for the indications of a <b>sulfotep</b> poisoning between inhalation, ingestion, intake by the skin and intake by the eyes. However, examples of poisoned greenhouse workers teach us an overall route of symptoms for a sulfotepp poisoning. Within the first hour after a poisonous intake of <b>sulfotep</b> people often suffer from nausea or headaches. After some hours diarrhea and vomiting may occur. People who inhaled <b>sulfotep</b> are often disorientated and have difficulties to breath. A poisonous dose may lead to a coma or death after 24 hours. The point at 24 hours after the poisoning is very important. If the dose is not lethal, the symptoms will slowly disappear after the point of 24 hours.|$|E
5000|$|An {{experiment}} in rats who were once given 0,4 mg radioactive phosphor-labelled <b>sulfotep</b> orally, {{has shown that}} <b>sulfotep</b> is excreted by both the kidneys (urine) and the liver (bile). The substance is completely metabolised. Two metabolites {{are found in the}} urine and faeces. The radioactivity showed that 85-91% was excreted in urine and 5-6% in the faeces.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sulfotep</b> {{was first}} commercially {{launched}} by BAYER in 1946. It {{is known as}} an organophosphate, which were also used for war efforts by British and German armies before use in agriculture developed. 2 <b>Sulfotep</b> is synthesized by a reaction of TEPP (tetraethyl pyrophosphate) with sulfur. Tepp itself was first synthesized by Philipe de Clermont in 1854., ...|$|E
50|$|The Dutch {{subsidiary}} of German chemical company BASF produced and stored <b>sulfotep</b> until 2004. The storage room was repurposed as an office. Some employees complained about lung problems after having worked in those offices.|$|E
50|$|A {{long-term}} {{exposure to}} a low concentration showed no toxicity.This was tested in rats. They were exposed to different concentrations of <b>sulfotep.</b> Exposed to the highest concentration of 2.83 mg/m3 for six hours a day, {{five days a week}} for 12 weeks, there was no change in appearance, behavior or body weight. The plasma cholinesterase activity decreased and the weight of the lungs of female rats increased. The red blood cell acetylcholinesterase activity was not affected. At lower concentrations, there were no changes at all.The rats were orally exposed to 0, 5, 10, 20 or 50 ppm <b>sulfotep</b> for three months. Only their plasma cholinesterase activity and RBC acetylcholinesterase activity were decreased. No further symptoms were observed.Dogs who were orally exposed to 0, 0.5, 3, 5, 15 or 75 ppm (equivalent to 0-3.07 mg/kg/day) for 13 weeks, ate less and lost weight. The plasma cholinesterase activity was already affected by a <b>sulfotep</b> concentration of 3 ppm (or higher). Red blood cell-acetylcholinesterase was decreased at 75 ppm. Diarrhea and vomiting occasionally occurred at 15 ppm, but were common at 75 ppm. The brain cholinesterase activity was unaffected.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfotep</b> {{is used in}} {{greenhouses}} as a fumigant formulation {{to control}} aphids, spider mites, whiteflies and thrips. It is formulated as impregnated material in smoke generators containing 14 to 15% active ingredient. Smoke generators are placed in the greenhouses and then ignited using inserted sparklers to generate a thick white smoke for fumigation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfotep,</b> just as all {{organophosphate}} pesticides, irreversibly inactivates acetylcholinesterase, {{which is}} essential to nerve function in insects, humans, and many other animals. Acetylcholinesterase normally hydrolyses acetylcholine after it was released in the synaps. When the acetylcholine is not degraded, it accumulates in the synaptic cleft. Thus it keeps on stimulating the nerve.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfotep</b> is desulfurated {{by either}} {{cytochrome}} P450 or the FAD-containing monooxygenases. In this reaction, the sulfur {{is replaced by}} oxygen, as seen in figure 2. The metabolites formed are monosulfotep and tetraethyl pyrophosphate (TEPP). To accomplish these reactions, a phospho-oxithirane ring is formed, which is highly reactive. This ring is thought to bind to acetylcholinesterase and cause toxicity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfotep</b> {{is made by}} a {{reaction}} from tepp and sulfur. An alternative route can be {{a reaction}} of diethyl chlorothiophosphate and water {{in a mixture of}} Na3CO3. Tepp is made by a reaction of diethylchlorophosphate with water to substitute the chloro-group with a hydroxyl-group. The product can react with another molecule of diethylchlorophosphate to form an ester, the tepp molecule. In this reaction pyridine is often used to clear the reaction from the HCl.|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the effects of}} pan cooking on PCBs, PCDD/Fs, pesticides and trace elements in meat from a risk assessment perspective. Three different realistic cooking intensities were studied. A GC_GC-TOF/MS method was {{set up for the}} multiresidue analysis of 189 PCBs, 17 PCDD/Fs and 16 pesticides whereas Cd, As, Pb and Hg were assayed by ICP-MS. In terms of quantity, average PCB losses after cooking were 18 ± 5 % for rare, 30 ± 3 % for medium, and 48 ± 2 % for well-done meat. In contrast, average PCDD/F losses were not significant. For pesticides, no loss occurred for aldrin, lindane, DDE or DDD, whereas losses exceeding 80 % were found for dieldrin, <b>sulfotep</b> or phorate. Losses close to the margin of error were observed for trace elements. These results are discussed in light of the physicochemical properties of the micropollutants as well as of water and fat losses into cooking juice...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} of detection limits of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in {{selected ion monitoring}} (SIM) with gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode with both electron ionization (EI) and negative-ion chemical ionization (NCI) are presented for over 50 pesticides ranging from organochlorines (OCs), organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) and pre-emergent herbicides used in the Canadian prairies (triallate, trifluralin, ethalfluralin). The developed GC-EI/SIM, GC-NCI/SIM, and GC-NCI/SRM are suitable for the determination of pesticides in air sample extracts at concentrations < 100 pg µL− 1 (< 100 pg m− 3 in air). No one method {{could be used to}} analyze the range of pre-emergent herbicides, OPs, and OCs investigated. In general GC-NCI/SIM provided the lowest method detection limits (MDLs commonly 2. 5 – 10 pg µL− 1) along with best confirmation (< 25 % RSD of ion ratio), while GC-NCI/SRM is recommended for use where added selectivity or confirmation is required (such as parathion-ethyl, tokuthion, carbofenothion). GC-EI/SRM at concentration < 100 pg µL− 1 was not suitable for most pesticides. GC-EI/SIM was more prone to interference issues than NCI methods, but gave good sensitivity (MDLs 1 – 10 pg µL− 1) for pesticides with poor NCI response (OPs: <b>sulfotep,</b> phorate, aspon, ethion, and OCs: alachlor, aldrin, perthane, and DDE, DDD, DDT) ...|$|E
40|$|Acesso restrito: Texto completo. p. 56 - 61. In {{the past}} few years, organophosphorus {{compounds}} {{become one of the}} most widely used classes of pesticides due to their acute toxicity against a wide variety of pests. In this work, a method based on solid-phase microextraction in mode headspace (HS-SPME) coupled to gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was developed and optimized throughmultivariate factorial design to determine residues of organophosphorus pesticides in cow's milk. Different parameters of the method were evaluated, such as fiber type, temperature, extraction and desorption times, sample volume, effect of salt addition and stirring velocities. The evaluated pesticideswere dichlorvos, <b>sulfotep,</b> demeton-S, dimpylate, disulfoton, parathion,methylparathion, fenitrothion, chlorpyrifos and ethion. The best results were obtained using polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene fiber and headspacemode at 90 °C for 45 min, alongwith stirring at 600 rpmand desorption for 5 min at 250 °C. Under the optimized conditions, the proposed methodology was able to determine all of the pesticides with variation coefficients between 6. 1 % and 29. 5 %. Detection and quantification limits ranged from 2. 16 to 10. 85 μg L− 1 and from 6. 5 to 32. 9 μg L− 1, respectively. To evaluate residues of these pesticides inmilk, cows were exposed to the pesticides of interest andmilkwas collected after 24 h. The developedmethodwas able to detect traceamounts of these pesticides in the collected milk samples...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{adequate}} and simple analytical method based on solid-phase microextraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography–flame photometric detection (GC–FPD) for {{the determination of}} eleven organophosphorus pesticide residues (i. e., ethoprophos, <b>sulfotep,</b> diazinon, tolclofos-methyl, fenitrothion, chlorpyrifos, isofenphos, methidathion, ethion, triazophos, leptophos) in vegetables samples (cabbage, kale and mustard) was developed. Important parameters that influence the extraction efficiency (i. e., fibre type, extraction modes, extraction time, salt addition, desorption time and temperature) were systematically investigated. Four types of commercially available fibres (i. e., 50 / 30 μm divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS), 65 μm polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB), 100 μm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and 85 μm polyacrylate (PA)) were evaluated. PA fibre exhibited the best performance and {{was used for the}} rest of the studies. The optimised extraction conditions were: extraction time, 30 min at room temperature; stirring speed, 1275 rpm; salt content, 10 % NaCl; desorption time and temperature, 11 min at 260 °C; and no pH adjustment of the sample extract. The method was validated over the range 0. 1 – 100 μg/L. Repeatabilities were satisfactory, ranging between 2. 44 % and 17. 9 % for all analytes. The limits of detection and quantitation ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 14 and 0. 03 to 0. 42 μg/L, respectively. The method was applied to twenty local vegetable (cabbage, kale and mustard) products. Chlorpyrifos (0. 22 – 1. 68 μg/kg) was the most detected pesticide in the tested samples. The obtained values are however lower than the Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) as stipulated in the Food Act & Regulations of Malaysia...|$|E
