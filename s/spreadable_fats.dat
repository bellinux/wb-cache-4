40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} major food {{sources of energy}} and macronutrients among Flemish preschoolers {{as a basis for}} evaluating dietary guidelines. Three-day estimated diet records were collected from a representative sample of 696 Flemish preschoolers (2. 5 - 6. 5 years old; participation response rate: 50 %). For 11 dietary constituents, the contribution of 57 food groups was computed by summing the amount provided by the food group for all individuals divided by the total intake of the respective nutrient for all individuals. Bread (12 %), sweet snacks (12 %), milk (6 %), flavoured milk drinks (9 %), and meat products (6 %) were the top five energy contributors. Sweet snacks were among the top contributors to energy, total fat, all fatty acids, cholesterol, and complex and simple carbohydrates. Fruit juices and flavoured milk drinks are the main contributors to simple carbohydrates (respectively 14 % and 18 %). All principal food groups like water, bread and cereals, vegetables, fruit, milk and <b>spreadable</b> <b>fats</b> were under-consumed by more than 30 % of the population, while the food groups that were over-consumed consisted only of low nutritious and high energy dense foods (sweet snacks, sugared drinks, fried potatoes, sauces and sweet spreads). From the major food sources and gaps in nutrient and food intakes, some recommendations to pursue the nutritional goals could be drawn: the intake of sweet snacks and sugar-rich drinks (incl. fruit juices) should be discouraged, while consumption of fruits, vegetables, water, bread and margarine on bread should be encouraged...|$|E
5000|$|European Union {{regulation}} has forbidden the pomazánkové máslo label {{because it}} contains the word [...] "máslo" [...] (butter). According to European regulations, only products containing more than 39% of milkfat can be called butter. The Slovak Republic accepted this decision immediately, whereas the Czech Republic did so after several court hearings. The new product name is a cream spread or <b>spreadable</b> <b>fat</b> in Slovakia. A Czech name has not been established yet—however dairies have announced they will call their product [...] "máslová pomazánka" [...] or (buttery spread) or [...] "máslový krém" [...] (buttery cream).|$|R
40|$|AbstractConsistent {{evidence}} {{exist on}} the harmful health effects of industrial trans fatty acids (TFA). In order to have accurate data on TFA intake and implement adequate measures to reduce their intake, each country should have updated estimates of TFA content in the diet. The objective {{of the present study}} was to provide data on the TFA content in food commercialized in the Portuguese market. The results on the TFA content of 268 samples acquired between October and December 2013 are reported. Samples were categorized as margarines and shortenings (n =  16), <b>spreadable</b> chocolate <b>fats</b> (n =  6), fried potatoes and chips (n =  25), industrial bakery (n =  4), breakfast cereals (n =  3), pastry products (n =  120), seasonings (n =  5), instant soups (n =  5), instant desserts (n =  6), chocolate snacks (n =  4), microwave popcorn (n =  4), cookies, biscuits and wafers (n =  53), and fast-food (n =  13), with butter (n =  4) included for comparison purposes. TFA were quantified by gas chromatography. Total TFA content in the fat ranged from 0. 06 % to 30. 2 % (average 1. 9 %), with the highest average values in the “biscuits, wafers and cookies” group (3. 4 % TFA), followed by the pastry group (2. 0 %). Fifty samples (19 %) had TFA superior to 2 % in the fat. These findings highlight there is still much need for improvement in terms of the TFA content in Portuguese foods, particularly in traditional pastry...|$|R
