5|$|Female <b>sexuality</b> {{is often}} not {{adequately}} represented in texts and documents. Until very recently, much {{of what has been}} documented about women's <b>sexuality</b> has been written by men, in the context of male understanding, and relevant to women's associations to men—as their wives, daughters, or mothers, for example. Often artistic representations of female <b>sexuality</b> suggest trends or ideas on broad scales, giving historians clues as to how widespread or accepted erotic relationships between women were.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only does}} SCI present {{children}} and adolescents {{with many of the}} same difficulties adults face, it affects the development of their <b>sexuality.</b> Although substantial research exists on SCI and <b>sexuality</b> in adults, very little exists on the ways in which it affects development of <b>sexuality</b> in young people. Injured {{children and adolescents}} need ongoing, age-appropriate sex education that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to <b>sexuality</b> and sexual function. Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their <b>sexuality,</b> but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in <b>sexuality</b> and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sexuality</b> is an {{important}} part of each person's identity, although some people might have no interest in sex. <b>Sexuality</b> has biological, psychological, emotional, spiritual, social, and cultural aspects. It involves not only sexual behaviors but relationships, self-image, sex drive, reproduction, sexual orientation, and gender expression. Each person's <b>sexuality</b> is influenced by lifelong socialization, in which factors such as religious and cultural background play a part, and is expressed in self-esteem and the beliefs one holds about oneself (identifying as a woman, or as an attractive person).|$|E

40|$|Sex {{education}} and diverse <b>sexualities</b> are controversial topics within the primary school arena. Concepts of childhood innocence have influenced sex education curriculum, policy development and teaching practices within schools. However, {{research shows that}} primary school-aged students are aware of and talk about <b>sexualities.</b> The aim {{of this research is}} to reveal the pedagogical experiences of primary school teachers in relation to scenarios inclusive of diverse <b>sexualities.</b> Social constructionist theories of pedagogy and phenomenographic methods are used to provide a detailed analysis {{of the ways in which}} primary teacher participants conceptualise their encounters with students who introduce concepts of diverse <b>sexualities.</b> This research reveals that primary students ask questions about diverse <b>sexualities,</b> they use homophobic expressions (often as a daily occurrence), they sometimes reveal homosexual feelings to teachers, some have same-sex parents and some are being raised with knowledge of diverse <b>sexualities.</b> Without comprehensive policy and curriculum support, and appropriate professional learning for teachers, teachers are unable to make well informed pedagogical decisions that promote inclusive education...|$|R
5|$|According to writer Devin Grayson, {{the amount}} of {{creative}} freedom allowed by editors in the portrayal of LGBT characters depends upon how popular and established a character already is. Long-standing characters that would require a retcon to change their <b>sexuality</b> {{are less likely to}} be shown as LGBT than newer characters. When such changes to a character's continuity are made, fans are often disgruntled, particularly when <b>sexuality</b> is involved, and Alan Moore suggests that creating a new character is preferable.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{teaching}} regarding <b>sexuality</b> {{calls for}} a practice of chastity, {{with a focus on}} maintaining the spiritual and bodily integrity of the human person. Marriage is considered the only appropriate context for sexual activity. Church teachings about <b>sexuality</b> have become an issue of increasing controversy, especially after the close of the Second Vatican Council, due to changing cultural attitudes in the Western world described as the sexual revolution.|$|E
5|$|Due to flirtations with {{characters}} of various genders and <b>sexuality,</b> fans have speculated Deadpool as pan- or omnisexual. Writers Gerry Duggan and Gail Simone, {{as well as}} Terry Miller, {{the director of the}} Deadpool film, accepts the fan theory. However, Fabian Nicieza, one of the creators of the character, stated on Twitter that such speculation on his <b>sexuality</b> is invalid because his “brain cells are in CONSTANT FLUX. He can be gay one minute, hetero the next, etc.” The comment upset many fans, for it suggests that Deadpool’s <b>sexuality</b> is linked to his mental disorder.|$|E

40|$|Geographies of <b>sexualities</b> {{started to}} develop within the Anglo-American {{academic}} context {{during the late}} 1980 s. In the 1990 s, propelled by the cultural turn, the swelling of post-structuralist and postmodern critiques, and a growing recognition of the limitations to scientific knowledge production and representation, geographers of <b>sexualities</b> introduced queer theory into human geography. Queer theory provided human geography with powerful tools for approaching not only straightforward spatialities of <b>sexualities,</b> but this new lens contributed {{to the development of}} human geographies as such. Currently, at least in the Anglo-Saxon geographical context, the field of geographies of <b>sexualities</b> is considered part of mainstream human geography. Therefore, the main goal of this thesis is to provide a few lines of reasoning for the development of geographies of <b>sexualities</b> in Czechia and Central Eastern Europe (CEE) and introduction of post-structuralist understandings, specifically queer theory. In contrast to other phenomena that may be locally exclusive or particular, human <b>sexualities</b> are everyplace, albeit quite variable and dependent on the context in which they "enter into language," become institutionalized, and are regulated.

40|$|As <b>sexualities</b> educators, {{we rarely}} examine the broader social context our <b>sexualities</b> are shaped within, {{nor do we}} often give {{meaningful}} instruction to students on how {{to come to terms}} with emotions and desire or choosing and being good partners. Some of the ways we 'do' masculinity, femininity and gender in this culture can compromise our ability to fully engage in loving relationships with our selves and others. Teaching <b>sexualities</b> as transformational learning, critical theory challenges us to do better, both as individuals and as a society aware of and resisting oppression. Instead of teaching as though the body and spirit can thrive independently of one another, an authentic <b>sexualities</b> education would address the many dimensions of human experience, including morality, physicality and emotionality...|$|R

5|$|SCI is {{extremely}} disruptive to <b>sexuality,</b> and it most frequently happens to young people, {{who are at}} a peak in their sexual and reproductive lives. Yet the importance of <b>sexuality</b> {{as a part of}} life is not diminished by a disabling injury. Although for years people with SCI were believed to be asexual, research has shown <b>sexuality</b> to be a high priority for people with SCI and an important aspect of quality of life. In fact, of all abilities they would like to have return, most paraplegics rated sexual function as their top priority, and most tetraplegics rated it second, after hand and arm function. Sexual function has a profound impact on self-esteem and adjustment to life post-injury. People who are able to adapt to their changed bodies and to have satisfying sex lives have better overall quality of life.|$|E

5|$|The innate <b>sexuality</b> of bloodsucking {{can be seen}} in its {{intrinsic}} {{connection with}} cannibalism and folkloric one with incubus-like behaviour. Many legends report various beings draining other fluids from victims, an unconscious association with semen being obvious. Finally Jones notes that when more normal aspects of <b>sexuality</b> are repressed, regressed forms may be expressed, in particular sadism; he felt that oral sadism is integral in vampiric behaviour.|$|E
5|$|With {{regard to}} sexual {{orientation}} categories, asexuality may be argued {{as not being}} a meaningful category {{to add to the}} continuum, and instead argued as the lack of a sexual orientation or <b>sexuality.</b> Other arguments propose that asexuality is the denial of one's natural <b>sexuality,</b> and that it is a disorder caused by shame of <b>sexuality,</b> anxiety or sexual abuse, sometimes basing this belief on asexuals who masturbate or occasionally engage in sexual activity simply to please a romantic partner. Within the context of sexual orientation identity politics, asexuality may pragmatically fulfill the political function of a sexual orientation identity category.|$|E

5|$|Before the 1960s, {{explicit}} <b>sexuality</b> of {{any kind}} was rare in speculative fiction, as the editors who controlled what was published attempted to protect their perceived key market of adolescent male readers. As the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were undisguised homosexuals, though these tended to be villains, and lesbians remained almost entirely unrepresented. In the 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by {{the civil rights movement}} and the emergence of a counterculture. New wave and feminist science fiction authors realised cultures in which homosexuality, bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm, and in which sympathetic depictions of alternative <b>sexuality</b> were commonplace.|$|E
5|$|Drugs, devices, surgery, {{and other}} {{interventions}} exist to help men achieve erection and ejaculation. Although male fertility is reduced, many men with SCI can still father children, particularly with medical interventions. Women's fertility {{is not usually}} affected, although precautions must be taken for safe pregnancy and delivery. People with SCI need to take measures during sexual activity to deal with SCI effects such as weakness and movement limitations, and to avoid injuries such as skin damage in areas of reduced sensation. Education and counseling about <b>sexuality</b> {{is an important part}} of SCI rehabilitation but is often missing or insufficient. Rehabilitation for children and adolescents aims to promote healthy development of <b>sexuality</b> and includes education for them and their families. Culturally inherited biases and stereotypes negatively affect people with SCI, particularly when held by professional caregivers. Body image and other insecurities affect sexual function, and have profound repercussions on self-esteem and self-concept. SCI causes difficulties in romantic partnerships, due to problems with sexual function and to other stresses introduced by the injury and disability, but many of those with SCI have fulfilling relationships and marriages. Relationships, self-esteem, and reproductive ability are all aspects of <b>sexuality,</b> which encompasses not just sexual practices but a complex array of factors: cultural, social, psychological, and emotional influences.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{views on}} <b>sexuality</b> vary, and have {{differed}} by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female <b>sexuality</b> {{have taken a}} few different directions. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in {{what came to be}} known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.|$|E
