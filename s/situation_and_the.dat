5|$|Both sides {{having been}} {{prompted}} by the new international <b>situation</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> recent strike wave in Poland, in September 1988 preliminary talks between government representatives and Solidarity leaders ensued in Magdalenka. Numerous meetings took place involving Wałęsa and the minister of internal affairs, General Czesław Kiszczak among others, {{at that time and}} in the following year, behind the scenes of the official negotiations conducted then. In November, Wałęsa debated on national TV Alfred Miodowicz, chief of the official trade unions. The encounter enhanced Wałęsa's image.|$|E

5|$|On 11 October 1943, Lorković {{was named}} Minister of Interior, where he {{advocated}} stricter policing, {{and a second}} term as Foreign Minister from 29 April until 5 May 1944, after his friend Perić was removed from office. It was agreed that Lorković would remain Foreign Minister and Minister of Interior simultaneously, but was soon replaced by Mehmed Alajbegović as Foreign Minister. After realising that Germany would lose {{the war and the}} NDH would cease to exist, he advocated radical changes in state policy. In February 1944, he wrote a detailed memorandum in German which summarized the history, current <b>situation</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fundamental problems of the NDH and its Armed Forces, as well as problems with the German Army.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July, a group {{representing}} Pakistani madrasahs, {{headed by}} Maulana Salimullah Khan, {{called for an}} immediate cessation of the Lal Masjid operation.

5|$|The {{multifaceted}} {{nature of}} design management leads to varied opinion, {{making it difficult}} to give an overall definition; furthermore, design managers have a broad range of roles and responsibilities. These factors, combined with a multitude of other influences such as the industry involved, company size, the market <b>situation,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> importance of design within the organization's activities.

5|$|While Maud is {{described}} in the book as an attractive young woman, not a deformed monster, Uncle Silas is carefully written and plotted, and it is almost certain that Le Fanu explicitly intended a comparison between Maud's <b>situation</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> legend of the wealthy woman living in isolation and desired only for her money.

5|$|Admiral Nikolai Kuznetsov {{believed}} that these ships could protect the planned Soviet aircraft carriers {{in bad weather}} from American cruisers and pushed to have them built, but the Shipbuilding Commissariat balked. It refused to begin detailed design work pleading {{the uncertainty of the}} post-war building <b>situation</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> already heavy workload of its design bureau. Undeterred, the Navy continued studying cruiser designs and planned a ten-year construction program for the period 1946–1955. This was based on defensive operations along the periphery of the Soviet Union against Anglo-American carrier groups while submarines would attack their lines of communication. Ten of these large cruisers were envisioned as part of this construction program. When the program was discussed by the Politburo on 29 September 1945 there was no great disagreement on the large cruisers, although Stalin favored increasing the size of their main guns to , but did not push the issue when Admiral Kuznetsov resisted.|$|E

5|$|Alan Brooke, {{commander}} of the British II Corps sought to put the matter of cooperation right with King Leopold. The King discussed the matter with Brooke, who felt a compromise could be reached. Van Overstraeten, the King's military aide, stepped in {{and said that the}} 10th Belgian Infantry Division could not be moved. Instead, the British should move further south and remain completely clear of Brussels. Brooke told the King that the 10th Belgian Division was {{on the wrong side of}} the Gamelin line and was exposed. Leopold deferred to his advisor and chief of staff. Brooke found Overstaeten to be ignorant of the <b>situation</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dispositions of the BEF. Given that the left flank of the BEF rested on its Belgian ally, the British were now unsure about Belgian military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Amidst much {{pomp and}} ceremony, with Justinian and the Patriarch of Constantinople in attendance, the Roman fleet set sail around 21 June 533. The initial {{progress}} was slow, as the fleet spent five days at Heraclea Perinthus waiting for horses and further four days at Abydus {{due to lack}} of wind. The fleet left the Dardanelles on 1 July, and crossed the Aegean Sea to the port of Methone, where it was joined by the last contingents of troops. Belisarius took advantage of an enforced stay there due to a lull in the wind to train his troops and acquaint the disparate contingents with each other. It was at Methone, however, that 500 men died of dysentery caused by mouldy bread. According to Procopius, the responsibility fell on John the Cappadocian, who had cut costs by baking it only once, with the result that the bread went bad. Justinian was informed, but John {{does not appear to have}} been punished. Belisarius took steps to remedy the <b>situation,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> army soon recovered.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Riverhillsoft {{released}} the first fully 3D survival horror game, Doctor Hauzer, for the 3DO. Both the player {{character and the}} environment are rendered entirely in polygons, while allowing the player to switch the view between three different perspectives: third-person, first-person, and overhead view. In a departure from most other survival horror games before and after it, Doctor Hauzer lacks any enemies; the main threat is instead the sentient house that the game takes place in, with the player having to survive the house's traps and solve puzzles. It also uses background music that heightens tension and changes depending on the <b>situation,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sound of the player character's echoing footsteps can change depending on the surface; these would later be used in Resident Evil. The game is today considered a formative step {{in the creation of}} the survival horror genre, improving on Alone in the Dark.|$|E

He had two hits and three RBI on April 13, {{including}} a two-run home run against Joel Hanrahan in a 50 victory over Pittsburgh. On April 21, because the Giants {{did not have any}} infielders available, Huff was positioned at second base {{for the first time in}} his career in the ninth inning of a tied game against the Mets.

5|$|Nelson {{returned}} to operate out of Genoa, intercepting and inspecting merchantmen and cutting-out suspicious vessels in both enemy and neutral harbours. Nelson formulated ambitious plans for amphibious landings and naval assaults to frustrate {{the progress of}} the French Army of Italy that was now advancing on Genoa, but could excite little interest in Hotham. In November Hotham was replaced by Sir Hyde Parker but the situation in Italy was rapidly deteriorating: the French were raiding around Genoa and strong Jacobin sentiment was rife within the city itself. A large French assault at the end of November broke the allied lines, forcing a general retreat towards Genoa. Nelson's forces were able to cover the withdrawing army and prevent them from being surrounded, but he had too few ships and men to materially alter the strategic <b>situation,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> British were forced to withdraw from the Italian ports. Nelson {{returned to}} Corsica on 30 November, angry and depressed at the British failure and questioning his future in the navy.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May 1944 General Sir Harold Alexander, {{commanding}} the Allied Armies in Italy, launched Operation Diadem, which finally {{broke through the}} Gustav Line and forced the Tenth Army to withdraw. In the process, a gap opened up between the Tenth and Fourteenth Armies, threatening both with encirclement. For this failure, Kesselring relieved von Mackensen of his command, replacing him with General der Panzertruppe Joachim Lemelsen. Fortunately for the Germans, Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, commander of the U.S. Fifth Army, obsessed with the capture of Rome, failed {{to take advantage of}} the <b>situation</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Tenth Army was able to withdraw to the next line of defence, the Trasimene Line, where it was able to link up with the Fourteenth Army and then conduct a fighting withdrawal.|$|E

5|$|Stelmach's premiership {{was heavily}} focused on {{management}} of the province's oil reserves, especially those of the Athabasca Oil Sands. He rejected calls from environmentalists to slow the pace of development in the Fort McMurray area, and similarly opposed calls for carbon taxes. Other policy initiatives included commencing {{an overhaul of the}} province's health governance system, amendments to the Alberta human rights code, a re-introduction of all-party committees to the Legislature, and the conclusion of a major labour agreement with Alberta's teachers. His government also attracted controversy for awarding itself a 30% pay increase shortly after its re-election, and featured strained relations with Calgary, one of Klein's former strongholds. Despite this, Stelmach increased the Progressive Conservatives' already substantial majority in the 2008 election. With the advent of the late-2000s recession, Stelmach had to cope with a deteriorating economic <b>situation</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Alberta government's first budget deficit in 16 years.|$|E
5|$|The NAACP later {{blamed the}} PTC {{management}} for intentionally dragging its {{feet on the}} contract that the TWU approved in late June. The NAACP claimed that the PTC management had hoped to undermine the TWU's position with the workers and to possibly oust TWU {{in favor of the}} more pliable PRTEU. The PTC was aware that the SmithConnally Act forbade strikes harming war production and that if, with a contract impasse, TWU itself had initiated a contract strike, the union might have been tossed out. This analysis of the situation was shared later by several historians, particularly by James Wolfinger. Another historian, Alan M. Winkler, also had a largely negative view of the company's role in the conflict and concluded that PTC management, while not overtly conspiring with the strikers, reacted feebly to the strike and tried to opportunistically exploit the <b>situation</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> racist attitudes of many white workers for their own purposes.|$|E
5|$|The {{system of}} noble {{democracy}} became more firmly rooted {{during the first}} interregnum, {{after the death of}} Sigismund II Augustus, who following the Union of Lublin wanted to reassert his personal power, rather than become an executor of szlachta's will. A lack of agreement concerning the method and timing of the election of his successor was one of the casualties of the <b>situation,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> conflict strengthened the Senate-magnate camp. After the monarch's 1572 death, to protect its common interests, szlachta moved to establish territorial confederations (kapturs) as provincial governments, through which public order was protected and basic court system provided. The magnates were able to push through their candidacy for the interrex or regent to hold the office until a new king is sworn, in the person of the primate, Jakub Uchański. The Senate took over the election preparations. The establishment's proposition of universal szlachta participation (rather than election by the Sejm) appeared at that time to be the right idea to most szlachta factions; in reality, during this first as well as subsequent elections, the magnates subordinated and directed, especially the poorer of szlachta.|$|E
