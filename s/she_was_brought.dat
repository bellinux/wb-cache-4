5|$|Agamemnons general {{condition}} in 1802 was so poor that, had hostilities with France not recommenced, she {{would likely have}} been hulked or broken up. Instead, after Britain's entry into the Napoleonic Wars, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> out of ordinary in 1804, recommissioned under Captain John Harvey on 31 July, and went to join the Channel fleet under Admiral William Cornwallis.|$|E
5|$|Dunderdale {{was elected}} to the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly in the 2003 general {{election}} defeating Liberal cabinet minister Walter Noel by 1,835 votes, taking 58 percent of the popular vote.

5|$|Gibraltar {{returned}} to England in July 1784, paid off, and in September was laid up in ordinary. Repairs costing £36,713.0.6d {{were carried out}} between February 1788 and August 1790. During the Great Spanish Armament, when Spain laid claim to the Nootka Sound, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> back into service under Captain Samuel Goodall in May 1790.|$|E

Jervis personally returned to Marseilles with a letter of thanks from the Board of the Admiralty to the governor for his assistance.|$|E
5|$|Queen Christina of Sweden's {{tendency}} to dress {{as a man}} was well known during her time, and excused because of her noble birth. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> up as a male and there was speculation {{at the time that}} she was a hermaphrodite. Even after Christina abdicated the throne in 1654 to avoid marriage, she was known to pursue romantic relationships with women.|$|E
5|$|Baeyertz {{was born}} as Emilia Louise Aronson on 29 March 1842 in Bangor, North Wales. Her family were wealthy {{orthodox}} Jews, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> up to strict Jewish ideals. She attended {{school for a}} while but, {{by the time that}} she reached thirteen, her family removed her from formal education and she remained at home due to her ill health. Instead, she spent her time with her mother, who used to read Shakespeare to her, and would spend time in her family's library practising reading aloud.|$|E

5|$|Cattle {{were raised}} at the farm. Eisenhower would often poke the rump of a bull with his shotgun {{to show what}} quality of steak the animal would {{eventually}} produce, alarming the Secret Service agents that were protecting him. Once, while barbecuing (something he loved {{to do on the}} farm), he made the mistake of announcing which cow he was cooking. As it had been the favorite cow of his granddaughter Susan Eisenhower, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> to tears.|$|E
5|$|The {{apprenticeship}} {{was approved}} by the governors of the orphanage on 30 June 1769; Day and Bicknell collected Sabrina on 17 August. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> to lodgings in London, where she met Edgeworth for the first time. Day changed her name to Sabrina Sidney: Sabrina, the Latin name for the River Severn, which her orphanage overlooked; and Sidney after Algernon Sidney, one of Day's heroes. Day became a benefactor, and subsequently governor, of the Foundling Hospital, and on 20 September 1769 he chose another girl for his experiment, renaming her Lucretia after the Roman matron.|$|E
5|$|In {{her early}} to mid-thirties, {{she became a}} lady-in-waiting (nyōbō) at court, most likely because of her {{reputation}} as an author. Chieko Mulhern writes in Japanese Women Writers, a Biocritical Sourcebook that scholars have wondered why Murasaki made such a move at a comparatively late period in her life. Her diary evidences that she exchanged poetry with Michinaga after her husband's death, leading to speculation that the two may have been lovers. Bowring sees no evidence that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> to court as Michinaga's concubine, although he did bring her to court without following official channels. Mulhern thinks Michinaga wanted to have Murasaki at court to educate his daughter Shōshi.|$|E

5|$|She lay {{derelict}} in the Hamoaze until April 1901, {{when she}} was sent to Malta as a depot ship. To release her name for the new armoured cruiser, Achilles was renamed Hibernia in 1902. She was renamed Egmont in March 1904, and remained in Malta until 1914. Her role in Malta was assumed by the stone frigate Fort St Angelo. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> home to Chatham that year, and served there as a depot ship under the successive names of Egremont (19 June 1916) and Pembroke (6 June 1919). The ship was sold for scrap on 26 January 1923 to the Granton Shipbreaking Co.|$|E
5|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> back {{on active}} duty at the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, and mobilized into the VI Battle Squadron for coastal defense, along with her sister ships. On 31 August 1915, the VI Battle Squadron was demobilized, and Siegfrieds crew was transferred to other warships. She was then used as a barracks ship in Wilhelmshaven, a role she filled {{until the end of}} the war. On 17 June 1919, she was stricken from the naval register. The navy planned to convert her into a salvage ship, but the plan was abandoned and she was instead sold for 425,000marks to H. Peters in Wewelsfleth. Siegfried was broken up for scrap the following year in Kiel-Nordmole.|$|E
5|$|Anne refused {{initially}} {{to appoint a}} new Lord High Admiral, and insisted on carrying out {{the duties of the}} office herself, without appointing a member of the government to take George's place. She burst into tears on the first occasion <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> papers to sign in George's stead. Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of Lord Orford, a member of the Junto and one of Prince George's leading critics, as First Lord of the Admiralty. Admiral Churchill retired, and Anne appointed the moderate Tory Lord Pembroke to lead the Admiralty, instead of a Whig. The Junto Whigs Somers and Wharton, however, were appointed to the Cabinet in Pembroke's vacated posts of Lord President of the Council and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The Whigs were still dissatisfied, and continued to pressure Pembroke and the Queen. Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709.|$|E
50|$|One such {{account of}} this appears with Cassandra in Aeschylus' play, where <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>brought</b> to Agamemnon's palace as a mistress. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> later killed by Clytemnestra, {{alongside}} Agamemnon himself, as she has started an affair with Aegisthus.|$|R

5|$|Edward IV {{seized power}} in 1461. When Edward {{captured}} Henry's wife, Margaret of Anjou, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> back to be detained at the castle. Edward began {{to revive the}} Order of the Garter, and held a particularly lavish feast in 1472. Edward began {{the construction of the}} present St. George's Chapel in 1475, resulting in the dismantling of several of the older buildings in the Lower Ward. By building the grand chapel Edward was seeking to show that his new dynasty were the permanent rulers of England, and may also have been attempting to deliberately rival the similar chapel that Henry VI had ordered to be constructed at nearby Eton College. Richard III made only a brief use of Windsor Castle before his defeat at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, but had the body of Henry VI moved from Chertsey Abbey in Surrey to the castle to allow it to be visited by pilgrims more easily.|$|E
5|$|Her parents, Franciszek Ksawery Plater and Anna von der Mohl (Anna z Mohlów), {{divorced}} {{when she was}} nine years old, in 1815. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> up by distant relatives, Michał Plater-Zyberk and Izabela Helena Syberg zu Wischling, in their family's manor Līksna near Daugavpils (Dźwina), then Inflanty (now Latvia). Well-educated, Plater was brought up to appreciate the efforts of Tadeusz Kościuszko and the Prince Józef Poniatowski. She was fascinated by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller, who she could read in the original German language. She was raised {{in an environment that}} valued the history of Poland, and her literary heroes included Princess Wanda and Adam Mickiewicz's Grażyna. She also admired Bouboulina, a woman who became one of the icons of the Greek uprising against the Ottomans, a Polish fighter Anna Dorota Chrzanowska, as well as Joan of Arc. These pursuits were accompanied by an early interest in equestrianism and marksmanship, quite uncommon for early 19th-century girls from aristocratic families. She was also deeply interested in Ruthenian and Belarusian folk culture. She had contacts and friends in the Filaret Association.|$|E
5|$|Magdeburg {{was used}} as a torpedo test ship after her {{commissioning}} until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> to active service and deployed to the Baltic. In the Baltic, Magdeburg fired the first shots of the war against the Russians on 2 August, when she shelled the port of Libau. She participated in a series of bombardments of Russian positions until late August. On the 26th, she participated in a sweep of the entrance to the Gulf of Finland; while steaming off the Estonian coast, she ran aground off the island of Odensholm and could not be freed. A pair of Russian cruisers appeared and seized the ship. Fifteen crew members were killed in the brief engagement. They recovered three intact German code books, one of which they passed to the British. The ability to decrypt German wireless signals provided the British with the ability to ambush German units on several occasions during the war, including the Battle of Jutland. The Russians partially scrapped Magdeburg while she remained grounded before completely destroying the wreck.|$|E

5|$|That night, Jack tells {{everyone}} that he trusts Juliet {{and that should}} be enough, but Sayid disagrees. Jack continues to explain that John Locke blew up the submarine that was to take him home. Claire suddenly collapses with blood gushing from her face. Juliet takes Jack and Kate aside and tells them she knows what's wrong with Claire because she did it to her. At the camp, Juliet explains that Claire's immune system has turned against her due to a latent reaction to medication in her bloodstream. The medication was designed by Juliet to keep Claire alive during her pregnancy. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> to the island to find out why women couldn't have children. The mother's body treats the pregnancy as a foreign invader and the immune system attacks; every pregnant woman on the island has died. Claire was the first to survive even though she showed some of the symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Minna Planer {{was born}} on 5 September 1809 to a former Army trumpeter, Gotthelf Planer, in Oederan, Kingdom of Saxony. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> up in poverty {{and then at the}} age of fifteen was seduced by Ernst Rudolf von Einsiedel, a captain in the King of Saxony's Guards, who {{abandoned}} her after making her pregnant.
