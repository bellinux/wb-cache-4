40|$|Yudaganawa dagoba in Uva {{province}} {{is one of}} {{the largest}} stupas in Sri Lanka which dates back to 2 nd century BC. Presently, this colossal stupa with a diameter about 91. 2 m and reaching a height of 13 m is undergoing several issues which necessitate it to be rehabilitated. The stupa was found in ruins and grown with vegetation until it has been preserved by subsequent restoration efforts in the recent past. However, it is not standing at its original height well-matched with the circumference at its base. Further, existing formation of the structure, existing foundation and ground condition are unknown. This paper presents structural assessment of existing stupa and proposal for rehabilitation in order to build the stupa to its full height. A literature survey has been carried out to investigate the structural formation of stupas in ancient Sri Lanka. The geometry of the present stupa and the soil profile under the stupa were assessed. Material properties have been found with adequate laboratory testing. Present condition was modelled using finite element analysis employing SAP 2000 and PLAXIS 2 D. The results show that the stresses generated within the existing stupa due to its self weight is well below than the compressive strength and the tensile strength of bricks. Based on the results, several alternative methods are proposed for rehabilitation and the options are analysed with respect to structural performance along with the existing condition and the religious beliefs, attitudes and rituals concerning the stupas. The possibility of cracking in the masonry due to the self weight in each alternative method was checked using a failure criteria developed based on the modified Von Mises theory. The final option was selected so as the stresses generated in the existing brickwork are satisfying the failure criteria and has the minimum intervention to the stupa in the context of ancient value and the concerns related to stupas. Consistent with that, it is shown; the existing stupa is capable of taking the load of proposed <b>solid</b> <b>brick</b> superstructure <b>without</b> showing any possibility of cracking...|$|R

Parallel to the announcement of Tanzimat Declaration (1839), to the political and economical relations improved with European states and to the Industrial Revolution in Europe, an effective change had been seen on design concept and construction techniques in Ottoman architecture. Many new buildings were built using modern materials and imported techniques such as <b>solid</b> <b>brick</b> (in western norms) masonry walls, steel beams at the horizontal and vertical bearers, cement and concrete.

Methods: Observational data are documented for 9 patients with AIDS who underwent surgery for acute appendicitis. Results: Of the 9 patients, 6 (66. 7 %) had acute appendicitis <b>without</b> <b>perforation,</b> while the other 3 (33. 3 %) had perforated appendicitis. An elevated preoperative temperature was found in 4 patients <b>without</b> <b>perforation</b> (66. 7 %), and in 1 patient with perforation (33. 3 %). An elevated {{white blood cell count}} was found in all 6 patients <b>without</b> <b>perforation</b> (100 %), but in none with perforation (0 %). The mean interval from surgical referral to laparotomy was 61. 1 hours, the mean hospital stay was 9. 3 days, and the perioperative mortality rate was 22. 2 %. Conclusion: Our experience should alert emergency medical staff who care for AIDS patients to the need for early diagnosis and prompt surgical treatment of appendicitis...|$|R

40|$|To date {{there is}} {{increasing}} pressure on surgeons to minimize {{the time that the}} patient stays in hospital. Patients with acute appendicitis <b>without</b> <b>perforation</b> or peritonitis are not discharged early due to concern {{on the part of the}} surgeon that it would increase surgical wound infection rates. The aim of this study was to compare surgical wound infection rates after open appendectomy (OA) of patients with acute appendicitis <b>without</b> <b>perforation</b> or peritonitis in an early discharge (ED) group and a control group without early discharge (late discharge [LD] group. The study was also to evaluate patient acceptance of ED in comparison to the LD group. A cross sectional study was carried out on adult patients (age > 14 years) with acute appendicitis <b>without</b> <b>perforation</b> or peritonitis, who underwent open appendectomy. The results showed that there was no significant difference (p> 0. 05) in surgical wound infection rates in both the intervention (ED) and control (LD) groups. In addition, there was a significant difference (p< 0. 05) in patient acceptance (satisfaction) in both groups, where patients in the ED group were more satisfied than the patients who had not been discharged early. The conclusions of this study are that early discharge from hospital after open appendectomy does not increase surgical wound infection rate and has good patient acceptance...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Flexible {{oesophagoscopy}} {{is regarded}} as superior to rigid oesophagoscopy {{on the basis of}} perforation rates as an end point. This advantage may be more apparent than real because no comparison has been made in a diagnostic setting in patients with carcinoma of the oesophagus with both perforation rate and diagnostic efficacy as indices. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out on data on 336 diagnostic oesophagoscopies in patients with carcinoma of the oesophagus, comparing rigid with flexible oesophagoscopy. RESULTS: Both rigid and flexible oesophagoscopies were performed <b>without</b> <b>perforation</b> when they were used for diagnosis only. Rigid biopsy achieved a diagnostic success rate of 99. 3 %, compared with 80. 5 % for flexible oesophagoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic oesophagoscopy can be achieved <b>without</b> <b>perforation</b> with either instrument, but the chance of diagnosing carcinoma was significantly greater with the rigid instrument...|$|R
