40|$|Pulses of {{potassium}} (K+) applied to columns of repacked calcium (Ca 2 +) saturated <b>soil</b> were <b>leached</b> with distilled water or calcium chloride (CaCl 2) solutions of various concentrations {{at a rate}} of 12 mm h(- 1). With increased Ca 2 + concentration, the rate of movement of K+ increased, as did the concentration of K+ in the displaced pulse, which was less dispersed. The movement of K+ in calcite-amended <b>soil</b> <b>leached</b> with water was at a similar rate to that of the untreated <b>soil</b> <b>leached</b> with 1 mM CaCl 2, and in soil containing gypsum, movement was similar to that leached with 15 mM CaCl 2. The Ca 2 + concentrations in the leachates were about 0. 4 and 15 mM respectively the expected values for the dissolution of the two amendments. Soil containing native K+ was leached with distilled water or CaCl 2 solutions. The amount of K+ leached increased as Ca 2 + concentration increased, with up to 34 % of the exchangeable K+ being removed in five pore volumes of 15 mM CaCl 2. Soil amended with calcite and leached with water lost K+ at a rate between that for <b>leaching</b> the unamended <b>soil</b> with 1 mM CaCl 2 and that with water. Soil containing gypsum and leached with water lost K+ at a similar rate to unamended <b>soil</b> <b>leached</b> with 15 mM CaCl 2. The presence of Ca 2 + in irrigation water and of soil minerals able to release Ca 2 + are of importance in determining the amounts of K+ <b>leached</b> from <b>soils.</b> The LEACHM model predicted approximately the displacement of K+, and was more accurate with higher concentrations of displacing solution. The shortcomings of this model are its inability to account for rate-controlled processes and the assumption that K+:Ca 2 + exchange during leaching can be described using a constant adsorption coefficient. As a result, the pulse is predicted to appear a little earlier and the following edge has less of a tail than chat measured. In practical agriculture, the model will be more useful in soils containing gypsum or leached with saline water than in either calcareous or non-calcareous <b>soils</b> <b>leached</b> with rainwater...|$|R
40|$|Displacement {{studies on}} {{leaching}} of potassium (K+) were conducted under unsaturated steady state flow conditions in nine undisturbed soil columns (15. 5 cm {{in diameter and}} 25 cm long). Pulses of K+ applied to columns of undisturbed <b>soil</b> were <b>leached</b> with distilled water or calcium chloride (CaCl 2) {{at a rate of}} 18 mm h(- 1). The movement of K+ in gypsum treated <b>soil</b> <b>leached</b> with distilled water was at a similar rate to that of the untreated <b>soil</b> <b>leached</b> with 15 mM CaCl 2. The Ca 2 + concentrations in the leachates were about 15 mM, the expected values for the dissolution of the gypsum. When applied K+ was displaced with the distilled water, K+ was retained in the top 10 - 12. 5 cm depth of soil. In the undisturbed soil cores there is possibility of preferential flow and lack of K+ sorption. The application of gypsum and CaCl 2 in the reclamation of sodic soils would be expected to <b>leach</b> K+ from <b>soils.</b> It can also be concluded that the use of sources of water for irrigation which have a high Ca 2 + concentration can also lead to leaching of K+ from soil. Average effluent concentration of K+ during leaching period was 30. 2 and 28. 6 mg l(- 1) for the gypsum and CaCl 2 treated soils, respectively. These concentrations are greater than the recommended guideline of the World Health Organisation (12 mg K+ l(- 1)) ...|$|R

5000|$|From 1980 to 1990 {{the primary}} focus of paleolimnologists efforts shifted to {{understanding}} the role of human impacts (acid rain) versus natural processes (e.g., <b>soil</b> <b>leaching)</b> as drivers of pH change in northern lakes. [...] The pH-sensitivity of diatom communities had been recognised since at least the 1930s, when Friedrich Hustedt developed a classification for diatoms, based on their apparent pH preferences. Gunnar Nygaard subsequently developed a series of diatom pH indices. By calibrating these indices to pH, Jouko Meriläinen introduced the first diatom-pH transfer function. Using diatom and chrysophyte fossil records, research groups led by Rick Battarbee (UK), Ingemar Renberg (Sweden), Don Charles (US), John Kingston (US), and John Smol (Canada) were able to clearly demonstrate that many northern lakes had rapidly acidified, in parallel with increased industry and emissions. Although lakes also showed a tendency to acidify slightly during their early (late-glacial) history, the pH of most lakes had remained stable for several thousand years prior to their recent, anthropogenic acidification.|$|E
50|$|FORECAST {{has four}} stages in its application: 1) data {{assembly}} and input verification, 2) establishing the ecosystem {{condition for the}} beginning of a simulation run (by simulating the known or assumed history of the site), 3) defining a management and/or natural disturbance regime, and 4) simulating this regime and analyzing model output. The first two stages represent model calibration. Calibration data are assembled that describe the accumulation of biomass (above and below-ground components) in trees and minor vegetation for three chronosequences of stands, each one developed under relatively homogeneous site conditions, representing three different nutritional site qualities. Tree biomass and stand self-thinning rate data are often generated from the height, DBH and stand density output of traditional growth and yield models in conjunction with species-specific component biomass allometric equations. To calibrate the nutritional aspects of the model, data describing the concentration of nutrients in the various biomass components are required. FORECAST also requires data on the degree of shading produced by different quantities of foliage and the photosynthetic response of foliage to different light levels (photosynthetic light saturation curves for either average foliage or separately for sun and shade adapted foliage). A comparable but simpler set of data for minor vegetation must be provided if the user wishes to represent this ecosystem component. Lastly, data describing the rates of decomposition of various litter types and soil organic matter are required for the model to simulate nutrient cycling. Simulation of <b>soil</b> <b>leaching</b> losses and certain measures of soil nutrient availability require input data that define cation and anion exchange capacity data for organic matter and mineral soil, and sorption-desorption processes. The second aspect of calibration requires running the model in “set-up” mode to establish initial site conditions. The detailed representation of many different litter types and soil organic matter conditions makes it impractical to measure initial litter and soil pools and conditions directly in the field; consequently, the model is used to generate starting conditions.|$|E

Georeferenced concentration of 53 elements (including potentially harmful ones), determined by ICP-MS after an aqua regia leach, were used to produce geochemical maps {{by means of a}} GISaided spatial interpolation process. Results show that there are two distinct areas: the larger, located between the Fiumendinisi, Budali and Ali villages, and the other between C.

Most of the investigated areas have high contamination levels for As, Zn, Sb, and Pb that exceed the threshold values (As = 20 mg/kg, Zn = 150 mg/kg, Sb = 10 mg/kg and Pb = 100 mg/kg) established for soils by the Italian Environmental Law (Decreto Legislativo 2006, number 152).

40|$|An {{approach}} {{for determining the}} relative contribution of agricultural, domestic and industrial activities in nitrogen contamination of surface- and groundwater consists in making up a budget of N - transfers at the scale of a watershed.

This budget is organized around three main N - stocks: - Nitrogen soil submitted to fertilizers inputs, to uptake by crop and to microbiological transformations which together influence nitrogen transfer towards surface- and groundwater. - Nitrogen river system arising from soil drainage and groundwater input, which is partly eliminated by denitrification occurring mostly in river sediments. - Nitrogen groundwater resulting from <b>soil</b> <b>leaching</b> and domestic effluents infiltration from cesspools or septic tanks.

In general, the streams flowing through areas partly or fully covered with pastures were more contaminated than those flowing through forest and cultivated areas.
