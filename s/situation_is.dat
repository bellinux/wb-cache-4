40|$|Video games offer {{a unique}} and {{flexible}} virtual environment in which to study human performance in response to virtual situational characteristics. In an experimental design, participants {{in the current study}} were presented with two conditions in an action video game environment. In Condition 1, the same virtual <b>situation</b> <b>was</b> presented on three occasions. In Condition 2, three different virtual <b>situations</b> <b>were</b> presented. Results revealed that person × <b>situation</b> interactions <b>were</b> of a notable magnitude, regardless as to whether the same or different <b>situations</b> <b>were</b> presented to participants, suggesting the presence of intraindividual effects across occasions. However, a general performance effect was only identifiable to a meaningful extent when different <b>situations</b> <b>were</b> presented (i. e., in Condition 2 only), suggesting that the presence of different <b>situations</b> <b>is</b> necessary in order for participants to exhibit general performance variability...|$|R

5|$|A problem {{faced by}} Unicamp, {{and other public}} {{universities}} in Brazil, is the high dependency on economic conditions, that directly impact tax earnings, {{while most of the}} expenses, payroll specially, are indexed to inflation. While not as critical as in similar universities (at the University of São Paulo payroll accounted for over 106% of the total funding available in 2014), Unicamp currently faces a funding crisis, with total funding expected to decrease in real terms while payroll, which takes around 85% of total university funding, is expected to increase in line with inflation. This <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> aggravated by the long-running trend of raising staff salaries above inflation {{as a response to the}} annual strikes led by the workers' union, STU.|$|E
5|$|About 1.2billion {{people in}} {{developing}} nations lack clean, safe water because most household and industrial wastes are dumped directly into rivers and lakes without treatment. This contributes to the rapid increase in waterborne diseases in humans. Out of India's 3119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities (WHO 1992). 114 cities dump untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River. Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. This <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> typical of many rivers in India {{as well as other}} developing countries.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the local}} {{television}} {{stations in the}} city, TVR Cluj (public) and One TV (private) broadcast regionally, while the others are restricted to the metropolitan area. Napoca Cable Network is available through cable, and broadcasts local content throughout the day. Other stations work as affiliates of national TV stations, only providing the audience with local reports {{in addition to the}} national programming. This <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> mirrored in the radio broadcasting companies: except for Radio Cluj, Radio Impuls and the Hungarian-language Paprika Rádió, all other stations are local affiliates of the national broadcasters. Casa Radio, situated on Donath Street, is one of the modern landmarks of the media and communications industry; it is, however, not the only one: Palatul Telefoanelor ("the telephone palace") is also a major modernist symbol of communications in the city centre.|$|E

Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict, and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important in decision making in uncertain conditions.|$|E

5|$|Hemoglobin is a tetramer {{with four}} oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon {{monoxide}} {{at one of these}} sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue. This <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> described as carbon monoxide shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury. Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.|$|E
