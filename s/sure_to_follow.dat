25|$|The final {{estimate}} of corn production {{for the years}} 1950 to 1959 in the United States is given as some three billion bushels and in recent years, some nine billion bushels are produced each year. Corn growth is dominated by west north central Iowa and east central Illinois. In 2011, the national average production was 147 bushels per acre, and reported to be 20 bushels per acre more than the yield in 2002. Based on a national contest in 2011 when an average of 300 bushels per acre was achieved others are <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> suit which result in a yield of 300 bushels per acre by 2030 from the same extent land holdings under corn.|$|E
25|$|This wave {{began at}} the end of the 1980s after the Revolutions of 1989. Its main theme was the hope that civil society, not {{enlightenment}} or revolution would pave the way for democracy in the Arab world. Civil society was seen as essential for emergence of democracy and that once a strong civil society developed, democracy was <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow.</b> It was hoped that democracy would be achieved by the end of 1990s or early twenty-first century at most. The Saddam Hussein-ordered Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the subsequent Gulf War have formed a strong reaction against tyranny, which was seen as the main cause of the crisis. It also weakened authoritarian regimes and gave civil society more space to maneuver. The number of non-governmental organizations in the Arab world jumped from less than 20,000 in the mid-1960s to over 70,000 in the late 1980s to 300,000 in 2008. Despite all of these developments, there was no significant democratic change in any Arab state throughout this period.|$|E

Goodfellow has the horns, ears, tail, and coloring of a deer, and can also turn into a real deer at will. Although he is nowhere near as skilled or powerful as Fanta in terms of magical power, he does have the ability to cast illusions, jump incredibly high, and ascend to Avalon.

2500|$|Warren's {{priority}} on fairness shaped other major decisions. In 1962, over the strong objections of Frankfurter, the Court agreed that questions regarding malapportionment in state legislatures were not political issues, and thus were not outside the Court's purview. For years, underpopulated rural areas had an equal {{voice in the}} state legislatures in the Senate where Los Angeles County had only one state senator just like Siskiyou County. Cities had long since passed their peak, {{and now it was}} the middle class suburbs that were underrepresented. Frankfurter insisted that the Court should avoid this [...] "political thicket" [...] and warned that the Court {{would never be able to}} find a clear formula to guide lower courts in the rash of lawsuits <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow.</b> But Douglas found such a formula: [...] "one man, one vote." ...|$|E

To the females, {{as well as to}} the men, he addressed his discourse. Heaven only knows what he said to them, but he caused smiles and blushes to mantle their ingenuous faces.

5000|$|The {{aboriginal}} Aleuts had no temples or idols, {{but there}} were holy or forbidden localities known as awabayabax. Here they made offerings to invisible spirits. Such holy places were found in every village, being usually a mound, or some prominent place or a crag, which women and young men were strictly prohibited from visiting, and especially from gathering the grasses for their basketry, or taking away stones. If any young person, either from audacity or curiosity, violated this restriction, such infraction was <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> be <b>followed</b> by terrible [...] "wild" [...] disease, speedy death, or at least insanity.

5000|$|One of the {{fascinating}} question any Kenyan gets is, [...] "Do you run?" [...] To which most reply, [...] "No,” to the disappointment of the enquirer. The {{explanation as to}} why Kenyans seem better equipped to run long distances has always eluded the curious souls; maybe it is the weather, or their bone structure, or the diet? Whatever it is, Max Fisher in 2012 attempted to answer, “Why Kenyans Make Such Great Runners: A Story of Genes and Cultures.” Some of what he concluded may be true, {{but the only way}} <b>to</b> be <b>sure,</b> is <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the steps of a Kenyan runner and find their secret.|$|R

It is poor in sea birds (specimens of those collected have been forwarded to the As. Society's Museum), and but one description of snake was observed. These hills belong partly to the Warsingali, and partly to the Habr Gerhajis. The frontier is in some places denoted by piles of rough stones. As usual, violations of territorial right form the rule, not the exception, and trespass is <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> be <b>followed</b> by a [...] "war." [...] The meteorology of these hills is peculiar. The temperature appears to be but little lower than the plain: the wind was north-easterly; and both monsoons bring heavy rains.|$|R

Keiran figures out Jeri's boyfriend Jeff is having an affair. Lorna goes out with Trevor. It's not much of date, but he helps her out in a big way. Both Andy and Lorna have feelings for each other, but aren't <b>sure</b> how <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> through with it.

Christie certainly felt at first as if kingdoms and thrones were going down, and each man being sent to his own place. A powerful and popular wrong was arrested, tried, and sentenced then and there, with a courage and fidelity that made plain words eloquent, and stern justice beautiful.

60|$|Whenever {{a person}} falls sick or meets with an accident, a conjurer is sent for, who {{attributes}} the disaster {{to some other}} person, on whom revenge must be taken.
