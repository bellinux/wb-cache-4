500|$|The {{second and}} most {{positive}} review {{was published by}} Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine in July 1818. The reviewer was most impressed with the journal section, particularly its informality and concision: [...] "the perusal of it rather produces the same effect as a smart walk before breakfast, in company with a lively friend who hates long stories". Covertly comparing the work to bluestocking Lady Morgan's recent France (1817), the reviewer found the female writer of History of a Six Weeks' Tour much more favourable: [...] "The writer of this little volume, too, is a Lady, and writes like one, with ease, gracefulness, and vivacity. Above all, there is <b>something</b> <b>truly</b> delightful in the colour of her stockings; they are of the purest white, and much more becoming than the brightest blue." [...] The Monthly Review published a short review in January 1819; they found the first journey [...] "hurried" [...] but the second one better described.|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{declared}} the game's graphics {{to be some}} of the best on the Nintendo 3DS. Eurogamer reviewer Rich Stanton praised the environments for their lighting and particle effects, while GameSpot credited the highly detailed character models, especially those of Jill and some enemies. IGN also highlighted the sound design, saying that [...] "Capcom has mastered the ability to play up a soundtrack when appropriate, sometimes completely cutting to isolated noises in order to focus a player on <b>something</b> <b>truly</b> haunting." [...] Game Revolution stated similar pros, noting that the game is best experienced when played in the dark with headphones on. Tim Turi of Game Informer praised the story for its episodic structure and pacing, but also admitted that BSAA agents Quint and Keith are the worst characters in the series' history. The fact that the game supports the Circle Pad Pro was seen as a valuable feature, as it gives players the ability to move, shoot and control the camera at the same time.|$|E
500|$|The album {{featured}} a much looser and rawer sound {{compared to the}} band's debut album, Ten. Ament said, [...] "When we made Vs., our second record, I remember thinking, 'Man, I wish our first record sounded like this.' I thought it was more direct, more powerful." [...] Besides the heavier songs, the album features two acoustic ballads in [...] "Daughter" [...] and [...] "Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town". A few of the songs incorporate elements of funk, including [...] "Animal", [...] "Blood", and [...] "Rats". McCready stated that it wasn't that the band [...] "sat down and decided to be funky," [...] but rather {{it came from the}} band [...] "exploring different directions and combining our influences." [...] Paul Evans of Rolling Stone said [...] "'Animal', 'Daughter' and 'Blood'... are songs of a kind of ritual passion, tapping into <b>something</b> <b>truly</b> wild."

500|$|Barker {{also had}} {{commercial}} interests, and {{was motivated by}} a drive for artistic and financial success. In this vein, the play {{was an attempt to}} please the anglophile public, but create <b>something</b> <b>truly</b> American in setting and theme. The portrayals of the Indians in the play, from a perspective of racial sensitivity, have been met with mixed reviews by modern critics. [...] Some write positively about the portrayals, saying that, other than Grimosco and Miami, the natives are noble, though primitive, and have a more “American” value system than the savages traditionally portrayed in British media of the period. Others, however, see the characters portrayed stereotypically as lusty, childlike, weak and corruptible beings, with the exceptions of Pocahontas and Nantaquas, who are portrayed positively only because they accept English values. [...] Still others take a middle ground, noting the range of representations. [...] In any case, the play {{can be seen as a}} justification of White assimilation of the natives, especially when examining Pocahontas’s choice to be with Rolfe as a microcosm of their societies.|$|E
500|$|... "New York" [...] was {{met with}} mixed reviews by many critics. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "We didn't {{actually}} expect the New Directions to win nationals, but the episode just {{felt like it was}} going through the motions rather than seizing the opportunity to do <b>something</b> <b>truly</b> spectacular." [...] The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff called the episode a [...] "good piece of television", and gave it a [...] "B+". He said it [...] "wasn't as good" [...] as the first-season finale, [...] "Journey to Regionals", [...] "largely because it wasted {{a lot of time on}} performances designed solely to show off how the show was actually in New York and also because it borrowed a lot of that episode's set pieces without finding anything remotely as powerful as the performance of 'Bohemian Rhapsody. Robert Canning of IGN gave [...] "New York" [...] a [...] "good" [...] grade of 7.5 out of 10 and stated, [...] "while not as epic as Nationals in New York should have been, 'New York' was a decent close to an enjoyable season." [...] The Atlantic Meghan Brown said the episode was [...] "an uneven end to an uneven season, with a few killer numbers, strange resolutions, and head-scratching plot devices", while her colleague Kevin Fallon opined that the season finale was [...] "no exception" [...] to Glee having [...] "been undeniably frustrating in season two", though [...] "there was still ample reason to tune in and enjoy".|$|E
500|$|Burger King's {{creative}} {{control over}} the game impacted its development defined {{as a set of}} rules. The first rule was that there was only one King character. In response, the developers had the idea of the Xbox avatars playing the game and finding the crown to become the King. This idea was rejected by Burger King who said players could not become the King. The developers' next idea was to have one person be the King and the other players lay traps to interfere with his deliveries, but this idea was again rejected by Burger King because the King could not be exposed to any danger. With the usual hazards and competition elements of the video games removed, the developers decided upon a stealth format with no human opponents. In order to better capture the accuracy and authenticity of the King's movements, the King was flown to Britain for motion capture for the game's production. Blitz Games' Edward Linley described Sneak King as the riskiest game concept of the project because it [...] "is the appearance and antics of the King himself that give the game its humor and life; without him, the game simply wouldn't work. Until we had the finished King model and motion capture in the game, we couldn't be certain the concept would gel. Fortunately, the moment he went in, we knew we had created <b>something</b> <b>truly</b> unique." [...] Sneak Kings programming code consists of 60,000 active lines with another 43,000 developer comment lines. The game's instruction manual does not include a list of credits.|$|E

500|$|... "Born This Way" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics upon its release. Michael Cragg from The Guardian called the song an [...] "almost disco anthem", {{and said the}} chorus [...] "crashes in {{with the weight of}} a discarded meat dress". He also felt that the [...] "campness" [...] of the music made the lyrics sound less serious than it is. Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons of The Washington Post stated that [...] "Born This Way" [...] was a [...] "hymn for LGBT Christians". Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave the song five out of five stars and labeled it as [...] "an immediate pop classic", complimenting the hook and the chorus. Alison Schwartz from People added that [...] "the club-ready anthem, complete with a few a cappella chants and Italian lyrics, shows off Gaga's powerhouse vocal chords—and knack for powerful songwriting." [...] Jem Aswad from Billboard responded positively to the anthemic nature of the song, and felt that it would become a staple song to be played on the radio and dancefloors in the following months. Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song five out of five stars, describing it as a [...] "life-affirming equality anthem, a straight-up club pumper and a flat-out fantastic pop song." [...] Writing for Slant Magazine, Sal Cinquemani understood that Gaga [...] "has tapped into <b>something</b> <b>truly</b> special, maybe even important." [...] He also complimented the song's underlying message of equality. Meghan Casserly of Forbes expected [...] "Born This Way" [...] to be the biggest gay anthem ever, since, according to her, it was written with that purpose in mind, and she also points out that it is [...] "the next girl power song". Annie Yuan of The Hollywood Reporter labeled the song [...] "a hodge-podge of other pop tunes." [...] Kevin O'Donnell of Spin gave a mixed review, pointing out lyrical similarities to Michael Jackson's [...] "Black or White" [...] (1991). He added that seeing the hype surrounding the project, he expected Gaga to release a song [...] "as epic and instantly classic as The Beatles' 'A Day in the Life' or Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody'.

Now, what I am always asking myself is this: is it possible to make a synthesis of these three great masters, a living synthesis that will be valid for our time? [...] Debussy's influence is present in the Fourteen Bagatelles (1908). These made Ferruccio Busoni exclaim 'At last <b>something</b> <b>truly</b> new!' [...] Until 1911, Bartók composed widely differing works which ranged from adherence to romantic-style, to folk song arrangements and to his modernist opera Bluebeard's Castle.
