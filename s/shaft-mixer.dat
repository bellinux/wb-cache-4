At present, {{there is}} no unitary methodology for calculating of shaft for mixing devices because the operating regime {{is characterized by a}} random variation of the regime parameters. Although the effect of the mixer weight on the own frequency, has been partially taken into account when the <b>shaft-mixer</b> system rotates in the air, it must be reconsidered if the <b>shaft-mixer</b> system rotates in a liquid. The calculation presented in this paper will take into account "hydrodynamic mass " of liquid, corresponding to the mixer that actually vibrates with it. This contributes to an increase of its inertia, and to reducing of the own frequency (respectively of the critical speed). In this paper, the influence of the working environment on the deflection of vertical cantilever shaft will be considered, and calculation relations for own pulsation of the shaft equipped with a mixer will be set, with consideration of mixer hydrodynamic mass. For this purpose, it is calculated hydrodynamic mass attached to the mixer, and the reduction factor of pulsation due to hydrodynamic mass...|$|E
