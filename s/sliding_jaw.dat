40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to design a {{clamping}} unit with mechanical multiplier. Unit {{will serve as a}} technological clamping element in the technical equipment. My task was to select the method of construction and design driving main unit for grip jaw. I chose a solution with a mechanical multiplier. The frame unit is made up of fixed and <b>sliding</b> clamping <b>jaw</b> and is self. Unit is designed as a built module. The entire structure must be designed to meet the initial parameters specified in the award of thesis. The main parameters include clamping strength of 80 kN, the extent of working stroke 15 mm and the size of a scroll, which is 250 mm. They are also listed in the award size constraints: the length, width, height dimensions and the coupling unit...|$|R
5000|$|Sinokannemeyeria is an extinct genus of dicynodont from China. It {{was a large}} (about 6 ft {{long and}} {{weighing}} 250 pounds), long snouted, dicynodont with downward-pointing tusks that grew from bulbous projections on its upper jaw. The muscle attachment sites {{on the back of}} the skull were quite small, which suggested that Sinokannemeyeria did not have powerful skull muscles for shearing plants, unlike other dicynodonts. Most dicynodonts chopped up food by <b>sliding</b> their lower <b>jaws</b> backward and forward. Sinokannemeyeria fed by tearing plant material with the front of the snout.|$|R

40|$|What {{this paper}} adds? What is already known on the subject? Multi-sensory {{treatment}} approaches {{have been shown}} to impact outcome measures positively, such as accuracy of speech movement patterns and speech intelligibility in adults with motor speech disorders, as well as in children with apraxia of speech, autism and cerebral palsy. However, there has been no empirical study using multi-sensory treatment for children with speech sound disorders (SSDs) who demonstrate motor control issues in the jaw and orofacial structures (e. g. jaw <b>sliding,</b> <b>jaw</b> over extension, inadequate lip rounding/retraction and decreased integration of speech movements). What this paper adds? Findings from this study indicate that, for speech production disorders where both the planning and production of spatiotemporal parameters of movement sequences for speech are disrupted, multi-sensory treatment programmes that integrate auditory, visual and tactileâ€“kinesthetic information improve auditory and visual accuracy of speech production. The training (practised in treatment) and test words (not practised in treatment) both demonstrated positive change in most participants, indicating generalization of target features to untrained words. It is inferred that treatment that focuses on integrating multi-sensory information and normalizing parameters of speech movements is an effective method for treating children with SSDs who demonstrate speech motor control issues...|$|E
40|$|Oviraptorosauria, an extinct {{lineage of}} coelurosaurian dinosaurs from the Cretaceous of Asia and North America, {{includes}} {{some of the}} most morphologically distinctive theropod taxa yet known. Their bizarre appearance and numerous skeletal similarities with extant birds instantly made oviraptorosaurs the subject of considerable interest when first discovered in the early 20 th Century by the American Museum of Natural History Central Asiatic Expeditions. Subsequent discoveries have only increased the potential of the group for informing the origin of modern birds and characters that make birds distinctive among living vertebrates, including the origin of flight. The current list of shared similarities between oviraptorosaurs and modern birds includes such striking features as loss of teeth, extreme pneumatization and ornamentation of the skull, an unusual <b>sliding</b> <b>jaw</b> articulation, reduction of the tail vertebrae to form a pygostyle, feathers of modern aspect, and the behavior of brooding eggs in the same stereotypical posture. Despite such an extended period of research and popular interest, some fundamental questions regarding oviraptorosaurs remain. First, what is the phylogenetic position of Oviraptorosauria within Coelurosauria? Recent analyses produce contentious results that disagree on whether oviraptorosaurs represent a clade of bird-like, non-avian coelurosaurs or whether they actually are nested within Avialae. Obviously, these disparate topologies pose disparate models of character evolution. For example, if oviraptorsaurs are avialans they represent the first evolution of flightlessness within that clade. Second, what are the phylogenetic relationships of the taxa comprising Oviraptorosauria? And lastly, what insight would a resolved tree topology provide the study of morphological evolution, both within Oviraptorosauria specifically and more generally within Coelurosauria? I analyzed 384 morphological characters and recovered two most parsimonious trees that resolve both the position of Oviraptorosauria within Coelurosauria as well as the interrelationships of species within Oviraptorosauria. Oviraptorosauria is found to have a sister group relationship with Therizinosauria, and this entire clade is positioned as the sister taxon to the clade formed by (Paraves + Alvarezsauridae). These findings support oviraptorosaurs as non-avian coelurosaurs and thus not avialans. The implication of this topology {{is that many of the}} avian-like characteristics expressed in the group are the product of homoplastic evolution between oviraptorids (a more exclusive clade within Oviraptorosauria) and avialans. These phylogenetic hypotheses subsequently are used to elucidate the evolutionary history of endocranial morphology in Oviraptorosauria and more broadly within Coelurosauria near the origin of avian flight. Using the relatively newly employed technology of computed tomography (CT), this study provides descriptive morphology of five coelurosaur endocasts (which approximate the shape of the brain in these taxa that effectively filled the endocranial space) and evaluates shared discreet morphological characters with respect to the aforementioned phylogeny. Diagnostic morphologies are found for Oviraptorosauria and the more exclusive clades, Maniraptora, Paraves, and crown birds. This study also is the first to use CT technology to divide the endocranial casts into six neuroanatomical partitions that correspond closely to the olfactory bulbs, cerebrum, pituitary space, optic lobes, cerebellum, and brain stem. These partitions are then used to evaluate how these different regions of the "brain" are evolving. The division of the endocranial cast into partitions is a novel approach to studying endocranial morphology. Previous analyses have been limited to surveying total endocranial volume and have not been able to distinguish between regions of the brain. Those earlier analyses established that crown birds possess a much larger endocranial space with respect to body size than more distantly related groups and that there is a general transition along the coelurosaur lineage towards an increased endocranial volume. This analysis distinguishes the expansion of the cerebrum as the primary driver of volumetric change within the entire endocranium and identifies three possible expansions of the cerebrum within the maniraptoran lineage. Unique volumetric morphologies are found for both Oviraptorosauria and Paraves. Most interestingly, the volumetric proportions of Archaeopteryx lithographica illustrate that this taxon shares a plesiomorphic morphology with other paravians, suggesting that non-avialan paravians such as Microraptor zhaoianus also possessed what has previously been referred to as a "flight-ready" brain that likely supported some type of volant activity...|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} dinosaurs, psittacosaurs had akinetic skulls: {{that is to}} say, {{the upper and lower}} jaws each behaved as a single unit, without {{internal}} joints. The only joint was the jaw joint itself, and psittacosaurs could <b>slide</b> their lower <b>jaws</b> forward and backward on the joint, permitting a shearing action. Unlike most ceratopsians, their beaks did not form curved tips, but were instead rounded and flattened. If the jaws were aligned, the beaks could be used to crop objects, but if the lower jaw was retracted so that the lower beak was inside the upper beak, the jaws may have served a nutcracking function. A nut- or seed-rich diet would also match well with the gastroliths often seen in well-preserved psittacosaur skeletons.|$|R
5000|$|Adjustable coach {{wrenches}} for the odd-sized nuts of wagon wheels were {{manufactured in}} England and exported to North America {{in the late}} eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. They were set either by sliding a wedge, or later by twisting the handle, which turned a screw, narrowing or widening the jaws. In 1840, Worcester, Massachusetts knife manufacturer Loring Coes invented a screw-based coach wrench design in which the jaw width was set with a spinning ring fixed under the <b>sliding</b> lower <b>jaw,</b> above the handle. This was patented in 1841 and the tools were advertised and sold in the United States as monkey wrenches, a term which was already in use for the English handle-set coach wrenches. For the next eighty-seven years a very wide and popular range of monkey wrenches was manufactured by Coes family partnerships, licensees and companies, which filed further wrench patents throughout the nineteenth century. Some Coes wrenches could be bought with wooden knife handles, harking back to the company's early knife making business. In 1909 the Coes Wrench Company advertised a six-foot-long [...] "key" [...] wrench, shaped like a monkey wrench, for use on railroads. The Coes wrench designs were acquired by longtime toolmaker Bemis & Call of Springfield, Massachusetts in 1928. After 1939 its successor companies manufactured monkey wrenches from Coes designs until the mid-1960s, yielding a production run of over 120 years.|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} morphology of the buccal mass of 23 {{species of}} cephalopod (Octopoda, 4 species; Teuthoidea, 17; Sepioidea, 2) was investigated by gross dissection, histology and observations on fresh preparations. Cephalopod beaks lack a joint or articulation point. The <b>jaws</b> <b>slide</b> and rotate around an area {{rather than a}} fixed point. During closing the superior mandibular muscle (SMM) provides {{the force of a}} bite and the largest movement vector, whilst the inferior mandibular muscle (IMM) acts to retract the upper beak, causing shearing action. Dorsal portions of the lateral mandibular muscles (LMM) flex the upper beak walls outwards, probably to accommodate the backwards sweep of the radula and buccal palps during closing. To open the beaks, the ventral portions of the lateral mandibular muscles pull the rear lateral walls of the two beaks towards each other, moving the lower beak back relative to the upper...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityIn modern automated manufacturing systems, {{there is a need}} for work-holding devices that provide for precision, accuracy, reliability, flexibility and remoteness of control. One of such devices is the diaphragm chuck which utilizes the strain energy of its varying thickness diaphragm plate for gripping action. The jaw-carrying diaphragm plate is deflected by a thrust load, and the jaws are bored or ground to the nominal diameter of the workpiece. Gripping action occurs when the workpiece is inserted into the jaws and the thrust is relieved. Designers and manufacturers of diaphragm chucks have in the past been limited to the use of empirical data for diaphragm chuck design. This design limitation has been caused by complex problems due to factors such as the varying thickness encastre diaphragm plate, the gripping couples and the stiffening effects of the <b>jaw</b> <b>slides.</b> This work involved the establishment, by theory and experimental verification, of the design and performance parameters of a diaphragm chuck, and the provision of diaphragm chuck design methodology. The designer is therefore able to achieve the a priori design of the diaphragm chuck. In addition, the user is able to adapt existing diaphragm plates to achieve required gripping forces within existing constraints. The scope of this research is the static gripping action for any number of symmetric jaws. The design method is for diaphragm plates with small thickness taper, and carry detachable <b>jaw</b> <b>slides.</b> The concept of the equivalent constant thickness is applied to the diaphragm plate. Gripping action is divided into two major phases - the separate deflections of the diaphragm plate by a thrust load and symmetric couples. These deflections are equated to obtain the gripping force. This research concludes that the gripping force of a diaphragm chuck is closely predicted by the equivalent constant thickness method. Design data and methodology are provided for diaphragm chuck design. Thus, a designer can now design a diaphragm chuck based on a desired and pre-specified gripping force requirement...|$|R
