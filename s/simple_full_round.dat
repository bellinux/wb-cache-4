40|$|Abstract: Inspired by {{the paper}} [10], using better {{differential}} characteristics in the biclique construction, we give another balanced biclique attack on <b>full</b> <b>rounds</b> PRINCE {{with the lower}} complexity in this paper. Our balanced biclique attack has 62. 672 computational complexity and 322 data complexity. Furthermore, we first illustrate a star-based biclique attack on <b>full</b> <b>rounds</b> PRINCE cipher in this paper. Our star-based biclique attack has 63. 022 computational complexity and the required data {{can be reduced to}} only a single plaintext-ciphertext pair, this is the optimal data complexity among the existing results of <b>full</b> <b>round</b> attack on PRINCE...|$|R

40|$|Description mkssd is {{a package}} that generates {{efficient}} balanced non-aliased multi-level k-circulant supersaturated designs by interchanging {{the elements of the}} generator vector. The package tries to generate a supersaturated design that has chisquare efficiency more than user specified efficiency level (mef). The package also displays the progress of generation of an efficient multi-level k-circulant design through a progress bar. The progress of 100 % means that one <b>full</b> <b>round</b> of interchange is completed. More than one <b>full</b> <b>round</b> (typically 4 - 5 rounds) of interchange may be required for larger designs...|$|R
