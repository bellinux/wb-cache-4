25|$|In Chile, 10A Magic {{connectors}} {{are commonly}} used for computer/laboratory power networks, {{as well as for}} communications or data equipment. This allows delicate electronics equipment to be connected to an independent circuit breaker, usually including a <b>surge</b> <b>protector</b> or an uninterruptible power supply backup. The different style of plug makes it more difficult for office workers to connect computer equipment to a standard unprotected power line, or to overload the UPS by connecting other office appliances.|$|E
25|$|A {{varistor}} {{provides no}} equipment protection from inrush current surges (during equipment startup), from overcurrent (created {{by a short}} circuit), or from voltage sags (also known as a brownout); it neither senses nor affects such events. Susceptibility of electronic equipment to these other power disturbances is defined by {{other aspects of the}} system design, either inside the equipment itself or externally by means such as a UPS, a voltage regulator or a <b>surge</b> <b>protector</b> with built-in overvoltage protection (which typically consists of a voltage-sensing circuit and a relay for disconnecting the AC input when the voltage reaches a danger threshold).|$|E

500|$|As Lois prepares dinner, Stewie {{puts the}} final touches on his mind-control device, only {{for it to}} be taken away from him by Lois, who won't allow 'toys' at the table. Later, Peter asks Lois for {{permission}} to attend an upcoming stag party. After he promises he won't drink, Lois lets him go. Unfortunately, Peter forgets his promise to Lois and plays such drinking games as [...] "Drink the beer". He goes to work the next day with a hangover, and falls asleep on the job as a safety inspector in a toy factory. Peter misses dangerous objects such as a butcher knife, a <b>surge</b> <b>protector,</b> a gasoline can, razor blades, a porcupine, a toaster with forks inside and a plug in water. The company receives bad press after releasing unsafe toy products, and Peter is promptly fired by Mr. Weed.|$|E
2500|$|The Snowbot was a robot {{shaped like}} a snowman who refuses {{to let go of}} the inkjet printer he has fallen in love with. After the printer is {{wrestled}} from his grasp, the robot utters a monotone [...] "Weeping. Weeping." [...] He is consoled by a Staples employee who offers him a <b>surge</b> <b>protector</b> or a computer mouse (depending on the ad) instead.|$|E
2500|$|To protect {{telecommunication}} lines, transient suppression {{devices such}} as 3 mil carbon blocks (IEEE C62.32), ultra-low capacitance varistors, and avalanche diodes are used. [...] For higher frequencies, such as radio communication equipment, a gas discharge tube (GDT) may be utilized. A typical <b>surge</b> <b>protector</b> power strip is built using MOVs. Low-cost versions may use only one varistor, from the hot (live, active) to the neutral conductor. A better protector contains at least three varistors; one across {{each of the three}} pairs of conductors. In the United States, a power strip protector should have an Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 1449 3rd edition approval so that catastrophic MOV failure does not create a fire hazard.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, {{response}} time under standard testing {{is not a}} useful measure of a <b>surge</b> <b>protector's</b> ability when comparing MOV devices. All MOVs have {{response time}}s measured in nanoseconds, while test waveforms usually used to design and calibrate <b>surge</b> <b>protectors</b> are all based on modeled waveforms of surges measured in microseconds. As a result, MOV-based protectors have no trouble producing impressive response-time specs.|$|R

50|$|The joule {{rating is}} a {{commonly}} quoted but very misleading parameter for comparing MOV-based <b>surge</b> <b>protectors.</b> A <b>surge</b> of any arbitrary ampere and voltage combination {{can occur in}} time, but surges commonly last only for nanoseconds to microseconds, and experimentally modeled surge energy can be less than 100 joules. Well-designed <b>surge</b> <b>protectors</b> should not rely on MOVs to absorb surge energy, but instead to survive the process of harmlessly redirecting it to ground.|$|R

50|$|The E1 pulse is {{the very}} fast {{component}} of nuclear EMP. E1 is a very brief but intense electromagnetic field that induces very high voltages in electrical conductors. E1 causes most of its damage by causing electrical breakdown voltages to be exceeded. E1 can destroy computers and communications equipment and it changes too quickly (nanoseconds) for ordinary <b>surge</b> <b>protectors</b> to provide effective protection against it, although there are special fast-acting <b>surge</b> <b>protectors</b> (such as those using TVS diodes) that will block the E1 pulse.|$|R
2500|$|In {{consumer}} electronics, particularly <b>surge</b> <b>protectors,</b> the MOV varistor size employed {{is small}} enough that eventually failure is expected. Other applications, such as power transmission, use VDRs of different construction in multiple configurations engineered for long life span.|$|R

50|$|Some {{important}} {{examples include}} the thyratron, krytron, and ignitron tubes, which are used to switch high-voltage currents. A specialized type of gas-filled tube called a Gas Discharge Tube (GDT) is fabricated for use as <b>surge</b> <b>protectors,</b> to limit voltage surges in electrical and electronic circuits.|$|R
50|$|In {{electrical}} and electronic engineering such electromagnetic pulses (EMP) occur internally {{as the result}} of the operation of switching devices. Engineers use voltage regulators and <b>surge</b> <b>protectors</b> to prevent transients in electricity from affecting delicate equipment. External sources include lightning (LEMP), electrostatic discharge (ESD) and nuclear EMP (NEMP).|$|R
50|$|A <b>surge</b> <b>protector</b> {{or simple}} {{capacitor}} or varistor can protect against most overvoltage conditions, while a lightning arrester protects against severe spikes.|$|E
50|$|A <b>surge</b> <b>protector</b> (or surge {{suppressor}} or surge diverter) is an appliance or device {{designed to protect}} electrical devices from voltage spikes. A <b>surge</b> <b>protector</b> attempts to limit the voltage supplied to an electric device by either blocking or shorting to ground any unwanted voltages above a safe threshold. This article primarily discusses specifications and components relevant {{to the type of}} protector that diverts (shorts) a voltage spike to ground; however, there is some coverage of other methods.|$|E

Among TIA-607-B’s list of metallic components {{in need of}} bonding are racks, enclosures, ladders, <b>surge</b> <b>protectors,</b> cable trays, routers, switches and patch panels.|$|R
