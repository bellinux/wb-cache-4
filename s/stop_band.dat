A periodic SL {{is known to}} exhibit a strong filtering action on the phonons in the <b>stop</b> <b>bands.</b> Hence, in this multi-SL system, A SL’s act as barriers for phonons in their <b>stop</b> <b>bands</b> (A <b>stop</b> <b>bands).</b> However, we show that those phonons in A <b>stop</b> <b>bands</b> are transmitted very efficiently through this system when they satisfy the resonance condition determined by {{the structure of the}} sandwiched B SL. This is analogous to the resonant tunneling of electrons in multiple-quantum-well structures. We demonstrate these results by calculating both the frequency and angular dependences of phonon transmission...|$|R

500|$|Zobel invented several filters whose {{defining}} characteristic was {{a constant}} resistance as the input impedance. The resistance remained constant through the pass band and the <b>stop</b> <b>band.</b> With these designs Zobel had completely solved the impedance matching problem. [...] The main application of these sections has been {{not so much for}} filtering out unwanted frequencies, the k-type and m-type filters remained best for this, but rather to equalize the response in the pass band to a flat response.|$|E
500|$|... m-derived filters or m-type {{filters are}} {{a type of}} {{electronic}} filter designed using the image method. They were invented by Otto Zobel in the early 1920s. This filter type was originally intended for use with telephone multiplexing and was an improvement on the existing constant k type filter. The main problem being addressed was the need to achieve a better match of the filter into the terminating impedances. In general, all filters designed by the image method fail to give an exact match, but the m-type filter is a big improvement with suitable choice of the parameter m. The m-type filter section has a further advantage in {{that there is a}} rapid transition from the cut-off frequency of the pass band to a pole of attenuation just inside the <b>stop</b> <b>band.</b> Despite these advantages, there is a drawback with m-type filters; at frequencies past the pole of attenuation, the response starts to rise again, and m-types have poor <b>stop</b> <b>band</b> rejection. For this reason, filters designed using m-type sections are often designed as composite filters with a mixture of k-type and m-type sections and different values of m at different points to get the optimum performance from both types.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the main}} {{advantages}} of waveguide filters over TEM mode technologies {{is the quality of}} their resonators. [...] Resonator quality is characterised by a parameter called Q factor, or just Q. [...] The Q of waveguide resonators is in the thousands, orders of magnitude higher than TEM mode resonators. [...] The resistance of conductors, especially in wound inductors, limits the Q of TEM resonators. [...] This improved Q leads to better performing filters in waveguides, with greater <b>stop</b> <b>band</b> rejection. [...] The limitation to Q in waveguides comes mostly from the ohmic losses in the walls described earlier, but silver plating the internal walls can more than double Q.|$|E

The gelatin samples, particularly in three dimensions, were more uniform than those recorded using polymeric photoresists because of the self-supporting property of the gelatin. The gelatin woodpile samples exhibited clear directional <b>stop</b> <b>bands</b> in the angular transmittance measurements. Furthermore, by exploiting the swelling property of the gelatin, {{we were able to}} tune these directional <b>stop</b> <b>bands</b> by the amount of swelling.

500|$|From this it {{is clear}} that smaller values of m will produce [...] closer to the cut-off {{frequency}} [...] and hence will have a sharper cut-off. Despite this cut-off, it also brings the unwanted <b>stop</b> <b>band</b> response of the m-type closer to the cut-off frequency, making it more difficult for this to be filtered with subsequent sections. The value of m chosen is usually a compromise between these conflicting requirements. There is also a practical limit to how small m can be made due to the inherent resistance of the inductors. This has the effect of causing the pole of attenuation to be less deep (that is, it is no longer a genuinely infinite pole) and the slope of cut-off to be less steep. This effect becomes more marked as [...] is brought closer to , and there ceases to be any improvement in response with an m of about 0.2 or less.|$|E

The influence of geometrical perturbations from rows to rows are investigated. Either the inner radius of the shells between two adjacent rows is varied, or the spacing between the rows is changed.

2500|$|For audio lines, it is {{invariably}} {{necessary to}} combine L/C filter components with resistive attenuator {{components in the}} same filter section.

[...] Without the resistor components, the filter, at least in theory, would increase attenuation without limit. [...] The attenuation in the <b>stop</b> <b>band</b> of the filter (that is, the limiting maximum attenuation) is referred to as the [...] "basic loss" [...] of the section. [...] In other words, the flat part of the band is attenuated by the basic loss down to the level of the falling part of the band which it is desired to equalise.
