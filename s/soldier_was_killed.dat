One British <b>soldier</b> <b>was</b> <b>killed</b> and eight injured in the blasts; martial law was lifted four days later.|$|E
5|$|Palestinian Arab irregulars led by Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni and {{his local}} commander, Abd al-Halim Jawlani, battled British Army forces in Bani Na'im in December 1938. According to British {{military}} accounts, {{a resident of}} Bani Na'im called for intervention when the rebels entered the town. Israeli scholar Hillel Cohen wrote that Fakhri Nashashibi, a political rival of al-Husayni, informed military authorities on three rebel units forcing Bani Na'im's largely pro-Nashashibi inhabitants to join the revolt. The British promptly confronted a force of 100 irregulars. With British Air Force assistance, al-Husayni's troops dispersed and fled east of Bani Na'im where they were pinned down. British forces killed 60 rebels and captured 15. One British <b>soldier</b> <b>was</b> <b>killed.</b>|$|E

The protest caused the JNA to withdraw a portion of military equipment previously based in Split to more secure locations and increase its combat readiness there. The blockade of Kijevo was lifted through negotiations days after the protest.|$|E
5|$|The {{repulsion}} of the Arab {{assault on}} Nicaea {{was an important}} success for the Byzantines. Emperor Leo III the Isaurian (r. 717–741) regarded the city's survival {{as a sign of}} divine favour towards his newly instituted iconoclastic policies, and was encouraged to drive them further. This is probably related to an incident mentioned in the account of Theophanes, where a certain Constantine, who served as a groom (strator) to Artabasdos, threw a stone on an icon of the Virgin Mary and then trampled on it. The <b>soldier</b> <b>was</b> <b>killed</b> the next day by a catapult, a fact which Theophanes reports as evidence of divine vengeance. However, this passage shows strong signs of tampering by the fervently anti-iconoclast Theophanes, from what was probably originally a pro-iconoclast story.|$|E
