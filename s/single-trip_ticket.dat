25|$|Metro {{also sells}} <b>single-trip</b> <b>tickets,</b> {{but they do}} not allow {{transfers}} to buses. Fares depend on the time of the use of the system. The cost of a ticket in the Horario Punta (rush hour, 7:00–8:59 and 18:00–19:59) is $700 (approx. US$1.18); in the Horario Valle (off-peak hours, 6:30–6:59, 9:00–18:00, 20:00–20:44, and all day on weekends and holidays) is $640 (approximately US$1.08); and in the Horario Bajo (low-use hours, 6:00–6:29 and 20:45–23:00) is $590 (approximately US$1.00). Senior citizens (65 and older) and students holding concession cards pay $200 (US $0.34). Senior concession fare does not apply during rush hours.|$|R
25|$|Originally, TransLink had {{proposed}} to scrap paper-based ticketing entirely, but following controversy over this proposal <b>single-trip</b> paper <b>tickets</b> were retained, whilst other paper ticket formats (weekly, monthly, daily and off-peak) were abolished. Apart from frequent user schemes, periodic ticketing formats {{have not been}} introduced for go card since its inception.|$|R
50|$|When {{the system}} was {{introduced}} in 2001, it was only available to subscribers of the Carte Intégrale annual pass. In 2003, it was increased to users of the Carte Imagine'R student pass. From 2005, the Navigo pass was available for travel within zones one {{and two of the}} Paris transportation region for Carte orange weekly and monthly passes. Since mid-May 2006, it has been possible to use the Navigo pass in the entirety of the Île-de-France region in place of the paper tickets of the conventional Carte orange, which was completely discontinued in February 2009. Single-trip and 10-trip (discounted) paper tickets are still available from station agents and ticket vending machines and are accepted in all stations and buses, though busier Métro and RER stations will usually have several turnstiles set aside for Navigo card holders exclusively. Bus drivers also sell <b>single-trip</b> <b>tickets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ticketing is by {{pre-paid}} proximity smartcard, which travellers have to {{pass through}} turnstiles at the entry to the separated bus platforms. During {{the early months of}} the system's operations, limited availability of the cards required a temporary method for access to the system involving purchasing a normal <b>single-trip</b> paper <b>ticket</b> at a cost of MXN$4.50. Starting in October 2005, and with smartcard supply able to cover the demand, access is done exclusively by using the card.|$|R
25|$|When the MRT {{opened in}} 1987, fares ranged from S$0.50 to S$1.10 in S$0.10 {{increments}} for all adult tickets, {{regardless of whether}} they were <b>single-trip</b> or stored-value <b>tickets.</b> Several discounted fares were available: senior citizens and permanent residents above the age of 60 could travel on a flat fare of S$0.50 during off-peak hours; children below the height of 1.2 metres and full-time students in primary, secondary, pre-university and vocational training (VITB) institutions paid a flat fare of S$0.30 at all times.|$|R
