5|$|Males {{mark their}} territories with dung piles and by urine spraying. Scrapes {{made by the}} feet {{in the ground and}} twisted saplings also seem to be used for communication. Members of other rhino species have a {{peculiar}} habit of defecating in massive rhino dung piles and then <b>scraping</b> their back feet in the dung. The Sumatran and Javan rhinos, while defecating in piles, do not engage in the <b>scraping.</b> This adaptation in behavior is thought to be ecological; in the wet forests of Java and Sumatra, the method may not be useful for spreading odors.|$|E

To make a rub, a buck uses his antlers to strip the bark off small-diameter trees, helping to mark his territory and polish his antlers. To mark areas they regularly pass through, bucks make <b>scrapes.</b> Often occurring in patterns known as <b>scrape</b> lines, <b>scrapes</b> are areas where a buck has used his front hooves to expose bare earth. They often rub-urinate into these <b>scrapes,</b> which are often found under twigs that have been marked with scent from the forehead glands.|$|R

5000|$|Males {{will begin}} {{claiming}} territories and pairing up in late March. When pairs are formed, the male begins digging out several <b>scrapes</b> (nests) along the high shore near the beach-grass line. The males also perform elaborate courtship ceremonies, including stone tossing and courtship flights featuring repeated dives. <b>Scrapes,</b> small depressions {{in the sand}} dug by kicking the sand, are often {{in the same area}} that least terns choose to colonize. Females will sit and evaluate the <b>scrapes,</b> then choose a good <b>scrape</b> and decorate the nest with shells and debris to camouflage it. Once a <b>scrape</b> is seen as sufficient, the female will allow the male to copulate with her. The male begins a mating ritual of standing upright and [...] "marching" [...] towards the female, puffing himself up and quickly stomping his legs. If the female had seen the <b>scrape</b> as adequate, she will allow the male to stand on her back and copulation occurs within a few minutes.|$|R

5|$|Bivalves {{vary greatly}} in overall shape. Some, {{such as the}} cockles, have shells that are nearly globular; cockles can jump by bending and {{straightening}} their foot. Others, such as the razor clams, are burrowing specialists with elongated shells and a powerful foot adapted for rapid digging. The shipworms, in the family Teredinidae have greatly elongated bodies, but their shell valves are much reduced and restricted to the anterior end of the body, where they function as <b>scraping</b> organs that permit the animal to dig tunnels through wood.|$|E

A short high whistle is the primary contact call between a pair, while a harsh <b>scraping</b> call is the most common call used by females and large young, and brooding females call to their young with a deep, soft, frog-like croak.|$|E

5|$|Pleurodesis is a {{procedure}} that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (<b>scraping</b> of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E

40|$|Combined {{detection}} of {{cell adhesion molecule}} 1 (CADM 1) and T-lymphocyte maturation-associated protein (MAL) promoter methylation in cervical <b>scrapes</b> is a promising triage strategy for high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) -positive women. Here, CADM 1 and MAL DNA methylation levels were analysed in cervical <b>scrapes</b> of hrHPV-positive women with no underlying high-grade disease, high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer. CADM 1 and MAL methylation levels in <b>scrapes</b> were first related to CIN-grade of the corresponding biopsy and second to CIN-grade stratified {{by the presence of}} normal' or abnormal' cytology as present in the accompanying <b>scrape</b> preceding the cervical biopsy. The <b>scrapes</b> included 167 women with CIN 1, 54 with CIN 2 / 3 and 44 with carcinoma. In a separate series of hrHPV-positive <b>scrapes</b> of women with CIN 2 / 3 (n= 48), methylation levels were related to duration of preceding hrHPV infection (PHI; What's new? The worse the cervical disease, the more heavily methylated the promoters of two genes, CADM 1 and MAL, according to a new study. The authors compared the promoter methylation level of the two genes in hrHPV-positive cervical <b>scrapes</b> with the CIN-grade of the underlying disease to try to spot any correlation. Patients with CIN 2 / 3 had significantly increased promoter methylation of both genes, and those with carcinomas had tremendous increases. Methylation levels also seem to be higher with longer duration of HPV infection, and in hrHPV-positive cervical <b>scrapes</b> with abnormal cytology. Overall, testing for promoter methylation of CADM 1 and MAL in cervical <b>scrapes</b> appears to be quite useful for detecting whether a patient requires treatment for cervical disease. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to detect and {{genotype}} 16 different human papilloma virus (HPV) types simultaneously using a short fragment polymerase chain reaction (SPF) hybridization line probe assay (LiPA). 152 women who were referred to the gynecologist because of abnormal cervical smear underwent colposcopic examination and repeat cervical smear. In addition, the cervical <b>scrapes</b> were analyzed for the presence of HPV by a novel general HPV polymerase chain reaction assay followed by a single reaction genotyping assay allowing for a simultaneous detection and identification of 16 different HPV types. HPV DNA was detected in 38 % of normal follow-up cervical <b>scrapes,</b> 51 % of <b>scrapes</b> with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, 78 % of <b>scrapes</b> with mild dysplasia (low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions), 86 % of <b>scrapes</b> with moderate dysplasia (high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions), and in 88 % of <b>scrapes</b> with severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ. One case of invasive squamous cell carcinoma was positive for HPV 16. Overall, a single HPV type was detected in 56 % of HPV positive <b>scrapes,</b> with HPV 16 being the most common and accounting for 45 % of all single infections. Forty-four percent of the positive <b>scrapes</b> contained multiple HPV types, of which double infections prevailed. Follow-up results proved the reproducibility and reliability of SPF HPV LiPA. In conclusion, we have used and evaluated the SPF-HPV-LiPA system for the detection and genotyping of HPV infections. The combined detection-typing method proved to be sensitive, specific, simple, and fast, making mass screening of cervical <b>scrapes</b> accessible for routine practice and facilitating individual patient management...|$|R

They also graze on zygotes and germlings of brown alga Fucus vesiculosus, when the alga is small up to 1mm.

40|$|Optimal {{conditions}} for the screening of cervical <b>scrapes</b> for human papillomavirus (HPV) were investigated by using filter in situ hybridization. Since integrated and episomal HPV can be found, cell lines containing viral DNA in an integrated form (HPV in CaSki) or in an episomal state (BK virus-induced hamster tumor cells) were used for optimization experiments. An increase in sensitivity was achieved by alkaline denaturation and neutralization before the specimens were spotted onto the membrane. This increase was 5 -fold for the episomal virus and 16 -fold for the integrated virus in the model system, as compared with other methods. To evaluate this method on clinical material, 1, 963 cervical <b>scrapes</b> were screened {{for the presence of}} HPV 6 / 11 and HPV 16. Nineteen <b>scrapes</b> were positive for HPV 6 / 11 or HPV 16; and in 1, 810 <b>scrapes,</b> no HPV 6 / 11 or HPV 16 could be detected by the modified filter in situ hybridization technique. <b>Scrapes</b> from which the interpretation of the modified filter in situ hybridization results were equivocal (n = 71, 3. 6 %) or in which positivity was detected for both HPV 6 / 11 and HPV 16 (n = 63, 3. 2 %) were further analyzed by the DNA dot spot technique. Eight <b>scrapes</b> with an equivocal result and only one <b>scrape</b> showing a double positivity by the modified filter in situ hybridization technique could be confirmed in the dot spot assay.
