40|$|Around {{the time}} of the impact of NASA's Deep Impact (DI) mission at comet 9 P/Tempel 1, in total 6 telescopes with {{altogether}} 7 different instruments, located at the La Silla (LSO) and Paranal (VLT) Observatories of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Chile, were used to characterize the dust properties before and after the event. The ejecta cloud expanded at an average speed of about 200 ms[SUP]- 1 [/SUP]during the first hours after the event. It reached stagnation distance of 25000 km about 3 days after impact. The pre-impact dust jet and fan activity (`porcupine' pattern) remained undisturbed after impact. In our measurements the jet activity can be traced to a few 100 km nucleus distance. In total 9 comastructures are identified which may originate from at least 4 regions of enhanced dust emission on the nucleus - one of this region may in fact be multiple. No obvious signatures of a new active region created by DI are found. The overall dust production during the impact compares to about 5 - 10 h of normal activity. The global expansion geometry of the DI cloud is compatible with a majority of dust grains in the micron <b>size</b> <b>range.</b> <b>Indications</b> exist for asymmetric brightness and colour distributions of the dust in the ejecta cloud. The dust temperature rose from about 280 - 290 K before to 330 K one day after the event and fell to pre-impact level the day thereafter. The dust reflected sunlight was found to be linearly polarized at about 7. 5 % in the visible and near-IR, at constant level within about 4000 km from the nucleus. No circular polarization of the dust is detected. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Within taxonomic groups, {{most species}} are {{restricted}} in their geographic <b>range</b> <b>sizes,</b> {{with only a}} few being widespread. The possibility that species-level selection on <b>range</b> <b>sizes</b> contributes to the characteristic form of such speciesrange size distributions has previously been raised. This would require that closely related species have similar <b>range</b> <b>sizes,</b> an <b>indication</b> of "heritability" of <b>range</b> <b>sizes</b> at the species level. Support for this view came from a positive correlation between the <b>range</b> <b>sizes</b> of closely related pairs of fossil mollusc species. We extend this analysis by considering the relationship between the geographic <b>range</b> <b>sizes</b> of 103 pairs of contemporary avian sister species. <b>Range</b> <b>sizes</b> in these sister species show no evidence of being more similar to each other than expected by chance. A reassessment of the mollusc data also suggests that the high correlation was probably overestimated because of the skewed nature of <b>range</b> <b>size</b> data. The fact that sister species tend to have similar life histories and ecologies suggests that any relationship between <b>range</b> <b>sizes</b> and biology is likely to be complicated and will be influenced by historical factors, such as mode of speciation and postspeciation <b>range</b> <b>size</b> transformations...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Urinary {{lithiasis}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common benign urological diseases. The pathogenic mechanisms of renal stone formation are complex and not clearly defined. We have studied the urinary protein composition of patients affected by calcium oxalate (CaOx) nephrolithiasis in a range of molecular weight between 1 and 5 kDa (medium size peptides). These molecules seem to have a double role in limiting the crystal adhesion to renal cells and at the same time in facilitating the degradation of crystals once internalised in cells. Their daily excretion is high, approximately 2 - 7 mg/die, even if studies have reported higher values. Our aim in surveying the urinary peptides was to look for qualitative difference in the medium <b>size</b> <b>range,</b> possible <b>indication</b> of the presence of a biomarker or any predisposing factors in patients affected by calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The urinary protein composition of 17 patients (11 male, 6 female; mean age 45 yrs +/- 14 SD) affected by CaOx nephrolithiasis was assessed in comparison with 17 healthy subjects. It was performed a qualitative assay using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) in a range of molecular weight between 1 and 5 kDa (medium size peptides). RESULTS: No differences were detected in the mass spectrums between patients and control subjects: all peaks overlapped. In addition, the values of peak intensity were comparable in both patient and control subject mass spectrums. CONCLUSIONS: In the range of molecular weight between 1 and 5 kDa, we have not detected significant differences in the urinary composition between stone former patients and healthy subjects. Our results warrant further research in different molecular size peptides...|$|R
40|$|Platinum (Pt), {{palladium}} (Pd) and rhodium (Rh) {{concentrations were}} determined in the feathers of three raptor species in Sweden; the sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and the gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus), {{as well as}} the main prey of the sparrowhawk (the house sparrow, Passer domesticus) and the gyrfalcon (the willow grouse, Lagopus lagopus). The analysis of feathers from 1917 - 1999 revealed a clear temporal trend, with significantly higher Rh concentrations in sparrowhawk and peregrine falcon after 1986. There is evidence for increasing PGE concentrations from 1917 to 1999 in peregrine falcon and sparrowhawk. This suggests that feathers reflect increased platinum group element (PGE) concentrations in the environment over this time period. Mean concentrations of PGE in feathers of raptors after 1986 ranged from 0. 3 to 1. 8 ngg- 1 for Pt, 0. 6 to 2. 1 ngg- 1 for Pd (indicative values), and 0. 1 to 0. 6 ngg- 1 for Rh. House sparrows in urban areas had significantly higher Pt and Pd concentrations than urban sparrowhawks. The higher Pd concentrations in relation to Pt and Rh may indicate the greater mobility of Pd in the environment. Although PGE concentrations are generally higher in birds living in urban areas, no significant spatial trend could be established. This is partly due to the widespread distribution of automobiles and partly because birds forage and integrate PGE exposure over large areas. Laser ablation analysis demonstrates that PGE contamination of feathers is predominantly external, consisting of small particles in the nanometer <b>size</b> <b>range.</b> Other <b>indications</b> of external contamination are that Pt and Pd levels are significantly higher in the vane than in the shaft and that PGE relative ratios (except Pd) reflect urban particles...|$|R

Ergonomic requirements are a main source of semi-similarity in <b>size</b> <b>ranges.</b> This approach {{is based on a}} process model for uncertainty analysis, the <b>size</b> <b>range</b> development methodology of Pahl and Beitz, and robust design principles. The process model captures the interactions between user, the man-machine interface and the scaled product (the appliance). Interactions between user, man-machine interface and appliance can be classified as planned interactions or disturbances, and either influence or impact a variation. Using three robust design principles for elimination of disturbances and elimination or reduction of disturbance influence or impact, the synthesis of solutions for man-machine interface design can be supported. The robust design principles are adapted to the interactions of the user and the man-machine interface with the <b>size</b> <b>range.</b> The outcome is integration of the two disciplines, ergonomics and <b>size</b> <b>range</b> development...|$|R

Urban particles were collected using a five-stage impactor at six sites in the winter of 2005 - 06. The impactor segregates the TSPM into five different <b>size</b> <b>ranges</b> (viz. > 10. 9, 10. 9 – 5. 4, 5. 4 – 1. 6, 1. 6 – 0. 7 and 10. 9 μm) and fine (< 1. 6 μm).

40|$|In {{the present}} paper {{the results of a}} size effect study on plain {{concrete}} unnotched and notched beams loaded in three-point bending are shown and compared with experimental results and Bazant's size effect law. The numerical results, obtained using the nonlocal microplane finite element code, confirm a strong size effect for smaller beam sizes. However, for larger unnotched beams the nominal strength tends to a constant value related to the uniaxial tensile strength. These results are in good agreement with what has been observed in experiments. The reason why the nominal strength of large unnotched beams should approach a limit value different from zero is investigated and the range of applicability of the size effect law is discussed. It has been concluded that the applicability of the size effect law is dependent on the problem type i. e. if the crack propagation before peak load is very stable the size effect law may be used in a rather broad <b>size</b> <b>range.</b> However, if this is not the case, the validity of the size effect law is limited to a smaller <b>size</b> <b>range.</b> Therefore, before extrapolating the size effect from tests with a small <b>size</b> <b>range</b> to a very large <b>size</b> <b>range</b> experimental data from a large <b>size</b> <b>range</b> should be available...|$|R
