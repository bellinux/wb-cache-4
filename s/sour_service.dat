40|$|The {{corrosion}} of pipeline {{which carries}} crude petroleum products {{is a serious}} problem in petroleum industries. Thus selection of material for combating pipeline corrosion is an important aspect. Various kinds of pipelines with different kinds of coatings from inside or use of inhibitors or other control methods are usually employed to combat the corrosion of pipelines. A recent concept is the use of nickel base alloy cladding in the inside of the mild steel pipe to control the corrosion from the highly sour gas environment. Recently M/s ONGC, an Indian company, laid Incloloy cladded mild steel gas pipelines for their transportation. In the present work, the corrosion behavior of this Incoloy and Incoloy cladded mild steel in sour gas environment was investigated using high pressure high temperature tests, sulfide stress corrosion cracking test, stress corrosion cracking and constant extension rate tests. The results of High Pressure High Temperature tests help to predict life of the material as well as suggest a method of repairing the defect if it is formed during service conditions. The results of Sulfide Stress Corrosion Cracking and Constant Extension Rate tests revealed that the suceptibility of the material to Sulfide Stress Corrosion Cracking was not affected by welding. The 'C' ring and `U' bend test results showed that the material was not susceptible to Stress Corrosion Cracking.

40|$|Serious {{concerns}} {{have been raised}} {{in recent years in}} the Oil & Gas Industry about the reliability of Dissimilar Metal Welds (DMWs) in <b>sour</b> <b>service.</b> The primary reason for these concerns is because DMW joints exhibit small-localized hard zones that are susceptible to Sulfide Stress Cracking (SSC). In the open literature some methods such as preheating have been suggested to overcome the problem of hard zone formation.

40|$|The {{resistance}} to sulfide {{stress corrosion cracking}} (SSC) of modified ASTM A 694 F 60 low alloy steel, produced by two different manufacturers, was studied by four-point bend-testing. The two materials are named material A and material B in this report. Both materials were tested in two different environments with different severity, one ?sweet-transition region? test and one ?<b>sour</b> <b>service?</b> test. The test conditions were controlled by the H 2 S partial pressure (pH 2 S) and pH. These parameters were varied in the two tests. Resistance to SSC was investigated on the base materials and on the thermal weld-simulated and notched materials. The thermal weld simulation was performed to provide the intercritically reheated CGHAZ, leading to a microstructure containing hard constituents. The tests were performed in autoclaves at room temperature with a pressure of 10 bars. The microstructure and Vickers hardness (HV) of both base materials and the heat affected zones were studied as these parameters affect the SSC susceptibility. The hardness of material B is higher than for material A and are respectively 249 &# 177; 2 HV and 214 &# 177; 5 HV. The hardness of the heat affected zone of the two materials are similar, both peaking at the center at about 400 HV. The microstructure of base material A mainly consists of bainite and ferrite/pearlite while material B mainly consists of acicular ferrite and bainite. The microstructure of the intercritically reheated CGHAZ is characterized by bainite laths among large prior austenite grain boundaries. At the grain boundaries, M-A constituents have crown in a ?necklace? formation. The base materials did not reveal cracking in the sweet-transition test, however, localized corrosion caused by CO 2 and H 2 S was found along the stressed side of the specimen. Base material B was more severely attacked than material A, based on the length and density of the corrosion pits. In the ?<b>sour</b> <b>service?</b> test, severe general and localized corrosion and cracking was observed in both base materials. The materials are therefore considered unsuitable for ?<b>sour</b> <b>service?</b> applications. In the HAZ specimens, of both material A and B, severe cracking was observed in both tests. The specimens were fully separated by cracking in the ?<b>sour</b> <b>service?</b> test. The welded materials are therefore considered highly susceptible to SSC when a notch exists in the intercritically reheated CGHAZ. The HAZ hardness {{is higher than the}} maximum hardness requirement for SSC resistance at 248 HV. It would therefore be beneficial to perform additional testing of the HAZ, with a hardness level within the requirements.

40|$|Abstract. Socket welds are {{commonly}} used to assemble small-bore carbon steel process piping systems {{because they can be}} fabricated fairly quickly and are somewhat tolerant of field fit-up issues. In the most simplistic terms, these welds are made by inserting the pipe into a socket and then seal welding using gas tungsten arc welding around the gap between the outside pipe wall {{and the end of the}} fitting. This leaves a notch in the root of the seal weld that is open to the process fluid. This notch can act both as a stress riser and a crevice capable of concentrating chemical species. In many process applications, these socket weld notches do not cause any in-service problems. However, in the case of <b>sour</b> <b>service,</b> these notches can become problematic because of the potential for sulphide stress corrosion cracking (SSCC). For SSCC to occur, the right combination of stress, environment, and material susceptibility must be present. Therefore, for socket welds to be used in <b>sour</b> <b>service</b> without the risk of failure, these parameters need to be controlled by proper design and fabrication of the welded joint. Since a crevice is created as a natural by-product of a socket weld geometry, where the SSCC environment will be present, the parameter most readily controlled to minimize susceptibility to SSCC is the microstructure and residual stress of the weld filler metal. As will be shown, this resistance to SSCC can b...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion is a {{key issue}} for {{operators}} in {{the oil and gas}} industry since production fluids contain some water and both CO 2 and H 2 S acid gases. In this context, this paper illustrates the development of a reactive barrier polymer against corrosion by H 2 S of offshore flexible pipes. The role of this reactive material, called anti-H 2 S material, is to avoid H 2 S reaching the structural steel layers of the flexible pipe during the whole service life of the structure, usually 20  years, and hence to place the steel layers in a sweet service environment. Placed between the existing pressure sheath and the steel layers, the anti-H 2 S material has the ability to neutralize H 2 S during its diffusion within the material. The neutralization is ensured by an irreversible chemical reaction on reactive components that are dispersed in the material. The raw material selection is based on both accurate requirements for their use in a flexible pipe and expected performances in a <b>sour</b> <b>service</b> environment over a long period of time. Some laboratory qualifications and experimental techniques are used to qualify the behavior of the material and build the material database.

Difficulties in limiting alloy hardness after the tempering of forged mechanical components (F 6 NM) are often faced. Variables affecting the thermal behavior of 13 Cr- 4 Ni-(Mo) during single and double tempering treatments have been studied by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, X-ray diffraction measurements, dilatometry, and thermo-mechanical simulations.

40|$|International audienceThe {{methodology}} for testing {{hydrogen induced cracking}} (HIC) resistance of carbon steel in mild <b>sour</b> <b>service</b> is discussed. When H 2 S content is low, the use of steel grades with intermediate HIC resistance often presents many advantages, such as higher mechanical properties and economical benefits. As a counterpart, fit-for- purpose testing procedures are {{required in order to}} assess the HIC performance at the intended service conditions. With regards low H 2 S environments, time of exposure is recognised as the critical testing parameter. The environment encountered in the annular space of flexible pipelines is very often mildly severe. Due to the high confinement, pH level is higher than in bulk conditions with the same gas composition but a larger V/S ratio between the volume of electrolyte and the exposed steel surface. H 2 S content in the annulus is also less than in the fluid transported in the bore of the pipeline, due to permeation through inner thermoplastic sheaths and consumption. Qualification tests of very high strength steel wires are therefore usually conducted with one month exposure at the predicted pH and PH 2 s in the annulus, while standard testing procedures referenced in ISO 15156 specify 96 h immersion but a higher H 2 S level. ln the present study, different grades of high strength steel wires were tested in environments containing as low as 100 ppmv H 2 S, with exposure times varying from 96 hours and up to 1 year.

While these steels show many superior characteristics, limitations are associated with the welding of these steels, particularly controlling the weld structure and properties and understanding how the weld metallurgy may influence the susceptibility to intergranular corrosion (IGC). The focus {{of this paper is to}} report on the findings from a detailed study of the various weld sections within a DSS pipeline, as a function of heat input and type of weld, in terms of the metallurgical structure, composition and mechanical properties and to assess the susceptibility to IGC. Welding was performed using the manual Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) technique at both high and low heat input conditions. Two different join configurations (double bevel single V bevel and double bevel single U joint configuration) were adopted. Structural analysis consisted of (i) optical microscopy of welded specimens; (ii) ferrite content determination; (iii) Vickers hardness measurements; (iv) Charpy impact studies and (v) transverse tensile testing. Two test methods namely a modified ASTM A 262 and a modified Double Loop Electrochemical Potentiokinetic Reactivation (DL-ERP) test was used to determine susceptibility to IGC.

The critical pitting temperature using American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) G 150 and ASTM G 48 method E confirmed LDX 2101 to be resistant to pitting corrosion (a form of CO 2 corrosion) in {{the oil and gas industry}}. When stresses are present in a chloride-containing environment, steels are prone to chloride-induced stress corrosion cracking (SCC). The results of a large number of tests demonstrated the superior resistance of LDX 2101 to SCC compared to standard austenitic grades in all these types of tests [46]. Also, the superaustenitic grade stainless steels (254 SMO and 654 SMO) presented in Table  1 also showed excellent resistance to SCC and SSC. NACE allowed the use of both solution-annealed and cold-worked 254 SMO and 654 SMO at any temperature up to 171 °C in sour environments, if the partial pressure of hydrogen sulfide does not exceed 15 psi (1 bar), the chloride content does not exceed 5, 000 ppm, and the hardness is not greater than HRB 95 for the solution-annealed material and HRC 35 for the cold-worked material [76]. Nevertheless, 254 SMO had been shown to be susceptible to crevice corrosion at temperatures above 30 °C in chlorinated seawater, while the extreme corrosion resistance of 654 SMO makes it an alternative to titanium and nickel-based alloys in many environments where crevice corrosion is possible. Both groups of stainless steels find extensive use in seawater applications, demanding process fluids and <b>sour</b> <b>service.</b> Thus, both 254 SMO and 654 SMO have an important place in the material solutions for the oil and gas industry as they tackle the problem of sour corrosion caused by a H 2 S corroding agent.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPressure vessels {{operating}} in <b>sour</b> <b>service</b> conditions in refinery environments can {{be subject to}} the risk of H₂S cracking resulting from the hydrogen entering into the material. This risk, which is related to the specific working conditions and {{to the quality of the}} steel used, shall be properly managed in order to maintain the highest safety at a cost-effective level. Nowadays the typical management strategy is based on a risk based inspection (RBI) evaluation to define the inspection plan used in conjunction with a fitness for service (FFS) approach in defining if the vessel, although presenting dangerous defects such as cracks, can still be considered “fit for purpose” for a given time window based on specific fracture mechanics analysis. These vessels are periodically subject to non-destructive evaluation, typically ultrasonic testing. Phased Array (PA) ultrasonic is the latest technology more and more used for this type of application. This paper presents the design and development of an optimized Phased Array ultrasonic inspection technique for the detection and sizing of hydrogen induced cracking (HIC) type flaws used as reference for comparison. Materials used, containing natural operational defects, were inspected in “as-service” conditions. Samples have then been inspected by means of a “full matrix capture” (FMC) acquisition process followed by “total focusing method” (TFM) data post processing. FCM-TFM data have been further post-processed and then used to create a 3 D geometrical reconstruction of the volume inspected. Results obtained show the significant improvement that FMC/TFM has over traditional PA inspection techniques both in terms of sensitivity and resolution for this specific type of defect. Moreover, since the FMC allows for the complete time domain signal to be captured from every element of a linear array probe, the full set of data is available for post-processing. Finally, the possibility to reconstruct the geometry of the component from the scans, including the defects present in its volume, represents the ideal solution for a reliable data transferring process to the engineering function for the subsequent FFS analysis...|$|E
40|$|In the {{offshore}} technology welded flowlines made of supermartensitic steels are experiencing first applications in practice. These materials {{are intended to}} replace higher alloyed steels following the principle 'Fitness for Purpose'. These new types of steels are very suitable for those applications, because of their corrosion resistance and of their strength. But specially for the use under <b>sour</b> <b>service</b> conditions there exists the risk of hydrogen uptake with subsequent cracking. To evaluate the cracking resistance of the welds {{as well as of}} the unaffected material in the as-delivered condition, it is necessary to determine hydrogen transport data. Within the scope of this research project, such data are quantified in permeation experiments carried out on steel membranes under realistic application conditions. This procedure allows it to use the results in computer-assisted lifetime calculations. It was found that the diffusion coefficients of the respective materials and structures do not depend on the chemical composition of the electrolytic solution. By contrast, the subsurface concentration, i. e. the hydrogen concentration infiltrating into materials, depends on the pH-value, on the H_ 2 S-saturation and on the composition of the electrolytic solution. The concentration of chloride ions was found to be the strongest factor of influence for the dependence of the subsurface concentration on the chemical composition of the electrolytic solution. In addition, a major influence of the chemical composition of supermartenstic steels on the permeation behaviour has been established. The comparison of the permeation behaviour between heat treated specimens and specimens with realistic weld microstructure revealed that especially the diffusion coefficients of the heat treated specimens increased by about ten times. This means that the hydrogen permeation behaviour in such joints must be determined separately in each individual case depending on chemical composition and on the heat control. (orig.)

This is justified by the rising demand for oil and gas, which is driving exploration and production into the deeper waters, and harsher environments. Steel catenary riser (SCR) is a riser concept that is attractive for deep and ultra-deepwater developments; this is {{as a result of its}} capability to withstand the increasing external hydrostatic pressure with increasing water depths, its availability in larger diameters, and its suitability in high temperature and <b>sour</b> <b>service</b> conditions. However, this concept faces limitations for use in conjunction with a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) system in deepwater, harsh environments. An alternative configuration to the SCR is the steel lazy wave riser (SLWR); this configuration allows the FPSO motion to be decoupled from the touchdown point (TDP) of the riser. Some of the areas of interest that is addressed in this thesis work are the extreme and fatigue performance of the SLWR when hanged from a turret moored FPSO in a typical harsh environment. The design basis was established using typical environmental and design data for offshore West of Shetland, and several analyses were performed to find an optimum configuration for the deepwater, harsh environmental condition. The integrity of the riser was checked in extreme sea state conditions, and detailed analyses were performed to establish the fatigue performance of the riser, considering both wave-induced fatigue and fatigue due to vortex induced vibration (VIV). In addition, detailed sensitivity studies were carried out to establish the extreme response behavior of the SLWR, by varying the main configuration parameters. Overall, this thesis work showed that the SLWR is a suitable riser configuration for deployment in conjunction with turret moored FPSO in deepwater, harsh environmental conditions. The extreme strength response and wave-induced fatigue performance are satisfactory, however, fatigue damage due to VIV was above the acceptance level, and this will require the introduction of VIV suppression devices along some lengths of the riser...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{is concerned with}} pitting corrosion in super martensitic stainless steel (SMSS) weldments in slightly <b>sour</b> <b>service.</b> Thee main objective with the present thesis has been {{to find out why}} pitting corrosion occurs in the heat affected zone (HAZ) at ambient rather than at elevated temperatures and how the corrosion mechanism depends on the welding process. The thesis is divided into six parts. Part I gives a general introduction to martensitic stainless steels, focusing on the metallurgical and corrosion properties. Part II is concerned with the conditions for initiating of pitting corrosion in two SMSS weldments. Optical microscopy in combination with sputtered neutral mass spectrometry has been used to examine the conditions, and it is shown that the corrosion resistance depends mainly {{on the nature of the}} surface oxide and less on the underlying microstructure. In the absence of H 2 S the initiation is associated with spalling of the iron-enriched chromium oxide within a narrow region approximately 6 mm from the fusion boundary, where the contaminated oxide layer is thinnest. As H 2 S is introduced, the region close to the fusion boundary become susceptible to localised corrosion because of the more extensive metal oxidation. Thus, the high temperature oxidation and iron oxide scale formation accompanying the welding operation appears to be the main factor affecting the pitting corrosion initiation in SMSS weldments. In Part III, a comparative study of the dissolution and repassivation behaviour of a Fe- 12. 3 Cr- 6. 5 Ni- 2. 6 Mo SMSS alloy and other stainless grades has been carried out. The SMSS alloy is characterised by means of the so-called “artificial pit technique”, and a diffusion model has been developed and employed for calculation of the pit surface concentration of dissolved species during the potential step experiments. For concentrations close to the saturation level, the dissolution kinetics are adequately described by a Tafel slope of approximately 57 mV/dec and a current density of 0. 5 mA/cm 2 at – 300 mV SCE. On the other hand, repassivation of the active pit surface occurs when the concentration of the dissolved species drops below 30 % of the saturation value. Based on a comparison with relevant literature data it is concluded that the observed response of the SMSS to localised corrosion is similar to that reported for other high-alloyed steels. This result is to be expected if the dissolution and repassivation kinetics are controlled by the content of Cr, Ni and Mo in the parent material. In Part IV, the specific effects of H 2 S on the pitting corrosion behaviour of a Fe- 12. 3 Cr- 6. 5 Ni- 2. 6 Mo SMSS alloy have been examined by means of the “artificial pit technique”. Addition of a critical amount of H 2 S is found to hinder repassivation and accelerate active dissolution in the SMSS pit within the stability domain of the adsorbed sulphur. Above the redox potential of H 2 S/S, the effect of H 2 S is found to cease, whereby dissolution and repassivation kinetics similar to H 2 S-free solutions are observed. Activated pits show no signs of repassivation, not even at low surface concentration of dissolved species. It is concluded that the resistance to pitting corrosion depends both on the potential and the H 2 S concentration and the effect of H 2 S is most significant at low potentials. Part V is concerned with the occurrence and appearance of pitting corrosion in SMSS girth welds in the presence of H 2 S. Galvanostatic and potentiodynamic measurements were carried out at ambient temperature and pressure, using both a deaerated solution and a 1 mM H 2 S solution. In conjunction with this study, a descriptive pitting corrosion model is proposed to explain the effect of the root surface condition and the role of H 2 S. The oxidized pipe surface close to the fusion boundary is found to be extremely vulnerable to pitting corrosion in the presence of H 2 S, while the same zone appears to behave inert in the deaerated solution. In the latter case the oxidised surfaces were found to repassivate. In the H 2 S solution, localized corrosion occurred in the most oxidized region of the HAZ, about 0 to 3 mm from the fusion boundary. Moreover, it was found that a modification of the as-welded root surface by grinding hindered any initiation of pitting corrosion in this region, again highlighting the important role which high temperature oxidation and oxide scale formation play in controlling the corrosion properties of SMSS weldments. Finally, in Part VI of the thesis, the practical implications of the above findings for choice and development of relevant corrosion test procedures have been considered. A key issue here is the effect of pre-exposure on the corrosion resistance of SMSS weldments in the presence of H 2 S. Pre-exposures have been simulated in test solutions resembling the conditions in a flowline. It is shown that the quality (i. e. passivity) of SMSS root surfaces can be largely improved by the use of an appropriate pre-exposure procedure. It is therefore recommended that all samples in the future are pre-exposed to an H 2 S-free solution before they are subjected to actual corrosion testing in solutions containing H 2 S to avoid pitting corrosion in the oxidized part of HAZ. This is deemed to be important in order to achieve realistic results. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
