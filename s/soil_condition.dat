25|$|In a 2001 {{review of}} hadrosaur eggshell and {{hatchling}} material from Alberta's Dinosaur Park Formation, Darren Tanke and M. K. Brett-Surman concluded that hadrosaurs nested {{in both the}} ancient upland and lowlands of the formation's depositional environment. The upland nesting grounds may have been preferred by the less common hadrosaurs, like Brachylophosaurus and Parasaurolophus. However, the authors were unable to determine what specific factors shaped nesting ground choice in the formation's hadrosaurs. They suggested that behavior, diet, <b>soil</b> <b>condition,</b> and competition between dinosaur species all potentially influenced where hadrosaurs nested.|$|E

40|$|Digital {{soil mapping}} {{requires}} two basic pieces of information: spatial {{information on the}} environmental conditions which co-vary with the <b>soil</b> <b>conditions</b> and the information on relationship between the set of environment covariates and <b>soil</b> <b>conditions.</b> The former {{falls into the category}} of GIS/remote sensing analysis. The latter is often obtained through extensive field sampling. Extensive field sampling is very labor intensive and costly. It is particularly problematic for areas with limited data. This chapter explores a purposive sampling approach to improve the efficiency of field sampling for digital soil mapping. We believe that unique <b>soil</b> <b>conditions</b> (<b>soil</b> types or soil properties) can be associated with unique combination (configuration) of environmental conditions. We used the fuzzy c-means classification to identify these unique combinations and their spatial locations. Field sampling efforts were then allocated to investigate the soil at the typical locations of these combinations for establishing the relationships between <b>soil</b> <b>conditions</b> and environmental conditions. The established relationships were then used to map the spatial distribution of <b>soil</b> <b>conditions.</b> A case study in China using this approach showed that this approach was effective for digital soil mapping with limited data...|$|R

25|$|Introduced grazing {{animals can}} also affect <b>soil</b> <b>condition</b> through {{physical}} compaction and break-up {{of the soil}} caused by the hooves of animals and through the erosion effects caused by the removal of protective plant cover. Such effects {{are most likely to}} occur on land subjected to repeated and heavy grazing. The effects of overstocking are often worst on soils of low fertility and in low rainfall areas below 500mm, as most soil nutrients in these areas tend to be concentrated in the surface so any movement of soils can lead to severe degradation. Alteration in soil structure and nutrient levels affects the establishment, growth and survival of plant species and in turn can lead to a change in woodland structure and composition.|$|E
25|$|The term biosolids {{is used to}} {{differentiate}} treated sewage sludge that can be beneficially recycled. Environmental advantages of sewage sludge consist of, application of sludge to land due to its <b>soil</b> <b>condition</b> properties and nutrient content. Advantages also extend to reduction in adverse health effects of incineration, decreased chemical fertilizer dependency, diminishing greenhouse gas emissions deriving from incineration and reduction in incineration fuel and energy costs. Beneficial reuse of sewage sludge is supported in EPA policies: the 1984 Beneficial Reuse Policy and the 1991 Inter-agency Policy on Beneficial Use of Sewage Sludge, with an objective to reduce volumes of waste generated. Sewage sludge contains nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus but also contains significant numbers of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa and eggs of parasitic worms. Sludge also contains more than trace amounts of organic and inorganic chemicals. Benefits of reusing sewage sludge from use of organic and nutrient content in biosolids is valuable source in improving marginal lands and serving as supplements to fertilizers and soil conditioners. Extension of benefits of sludge on agriculture commodities include increase forest productivity, accelerated tree growth, re-vegetation of forest land previously devastated by natural disasters or construction activities. Also, sewage sludge use to aid growth of final vegetative cap for municipal solid waste landfills is enormously beneficial. Opposing benefits of sludge water result from high levels of pathogenic organisms that can possibly contaminate soil, water, crops, livestock, and fish. Pathogens, metals, organic chemical content and odors are cause of major health, environmental and aesthetic factors. Sludge treatment processes reduce the level of pathogens which becomes important when applying sludge to land as well as distributing and marketing it. Pollutants of sewage sludge come from domestic wastewater, discharge of industrial wastewater, municipal sewers and also from runoffs from parking lots, lawns and fields that were applied fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides.|$|E
2500|$|The {{horse collar}} {{eventually}} spread to Europe c. 920 AD, and became universal by the 12th century. The Scandinavians {{were among the}} first to utilize a horse collar that did not constrain the breathing passages of the horses. Prior to this development, oxen still remained the primary choice of animal for farm labor, as all the previous harnesses and collars could only be worn by them without physical penalty. Additionally, the yoke used to harness oxen were made exclusive to each individual animal. However it was sometimes difficult to cultivate the land; based upon <b>soil</b> <b>condition,</b> it may have taken up to sixteen oxen to effectively use a single heavy plow. [...] This made it difficult for farmers who lacked the capital to sustain such large numbers.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{uncertainty}} {{attributed to}} the link between different <b>soil</b> <b>conditions</b> and sites of die-off for several reasons. First, measurements may not be taken in frequent enough intervals to capture brief fluctuations in <b>soil</b> <b>conditions</b> associated with die-off. Second, attributing causation with changing <b>soil</b> <b>conditions</b> and die-off is potentially dubious. Reverse causality is a potential explanation; that is, soil chemistry differences may be a result rather than an agent of die-off. For instance, one study noted higher salinity levels in die-off areas in some months, but this was possibly attributable to altered root or evaporation dynamics due to die-off (Marsh 2007).|$|R
