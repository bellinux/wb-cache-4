5000|$|In 1920, the Belgian arms {{manufacturer}} Fabrique Nationale (FN) acquired {{sales and}} production {{rights to the}} BAR series of firearms in Europe from Colt. The first BAR model sold by FN was the Kg m/21 (Kg—Kulsprutegevär or [...] "machine rifle") chambered for the 6.5×55mm m/94 cartridge. The m/21 is {{a variant of the}} Model 1919 designed to Swedish specifications and manufactured initially by Colt's and later under license at the Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori in Eskilstuna. Compared to the Model 1919, the Swedish weapon has—apart from the different caliber—a spiked bipod and pistol grip. The m/21 would become one of Sweden's main support weapons in the interwar years together with the water-cooled belt-fed Ksp m/1914 medium machine gun (Swedish adaptation of the Austrian M07/12). Dissatisfied with the rapidly overheating fixed barrel of the m/21, Carl Gustaf began to design a new quick-detach mechanism for the barrel which mates the externally grooved chamber to a series of rotating flanges in the receiver operated by a locking lever. The barrel also received cooling fins along its entire length. These enhancements were incorporated into the fm/1935 prototype which was favorably evaluated during trials in 1935. The final version was the Kg m/37, adopted for service in 1937, which uses a smooth contour, unfinned barrel. Numerous m/21 guns were retrofitted with the screw-on receiver extension and quick-change barrel, and renamed the Kg m/21-37. The m/37 remained in service until being replaced by the FN MAG, but was still in <b>second-line</b> <b>use</b> until 1980. Carl Gustaf also developed a belt-fed prototype; however, it was never adopted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Ambulatory {{antibiotic}} prescribing {{contributes to}} the development of antibiotic resistance and increases societal costs. Here, we estimate the hidden societal cost of antibiotic resistance per antibiotic prescribed in the United States. Methods In an exploratory analysis, we used published data to develop point and range estimates for the hidden societal cost of antibiotic resistance (SCAR) attributable to each ambulatory antibiotic prescription in the United States. We developed four estimation methods that focused on the antibiotic-resistance attributable costs of hospitalization, <b>second-line</b> inpatient antibiotic <b>use,</b> <b>second-line</b> outpatient antibiotic <b>use,</b> and antibiotic stewardship, then summed the estimates across all methods. Results The total SCAR attributable to each ambulatory antibiotic prescription was estimated to be $ 13 (range: $ 3 –$ 95). The greatest contributor to the total SCAR was the cost of hospitalization ($ 9; 69  % of the total SCAR). The costs of <b>second-line</b> inpatient antibiotic <b>use</b> ($ 1; 8  % of the total SCAR), <b>second-line</b> outpatient antibiotic <b>use</b> ($ 2; 15  % of the total SCAR) and antibiotic stewardship ($ 1; 8  %).

Assuming an average antibiotic cost of $ 20, the total SCAR attributable to each ambulatory antibiotic prescription would increase antibiotic costs by 65  % (range: 15 – 475  %) if incorporated into antibiotic costs paid by patients or payers. Conclusions Each ambulatory antibiotic prescription is associated with a hidden SCAR that substantially increases the cost of an antibiotic prescription in the United States.

40|$|The optimal {{sequencing}} of targeted therapies for metastatic {{renal cell carcinoma}} (mRCC) is unknown. Observational studies {{with a variety of}} designs have reported differing results. The objective {{of this study is to}} systematically summarize and interpret the published real-world evidence comparing sequential treatment for mRCC. A search was conducted in Medline and Embase (2009 - 2013), and conference proceedings from American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium (ASCO-GU), and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) (2011 - 2013). We systematically reviewed observational studies comparing second-line mRCC treatment with mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) versus vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Studies were evaluated for 1) use of a retrospective cohort design after initiation of second-line therapy, 2) adjustment for patient characteristics, and 3) use of data from multiple centers. Meta-analyses were conducted for comparisons of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Ten studies reported OS and exhibited significant heterogeneity in estimated second-line treatment effects (I 2  =  68 %; P =  0. 001). Four of these were adjusted, multicenter, retrospective cohort studies, and these showed no evidence of heterogeneity (I 2  =  0 %; P =  0. 61) and a significant association between second-line mTORi (> 75 % everolimus) and longer OS compared to VEGF TKI (> 60 % sorafenib) (HR =  0. 82, 95 % CI: 0. 68 to 0. 98) in a meta-analysis. Seven studies comparing PFS showed significant heterogeneity overall and among the adjusted, multicenter, retrospective cohort studies. Real-world observational data for axitinib outcomes was limited at the time of this study. Real-world studies employed different designs and reported heterogeneous results comparing the effectiveness of second-line mTORi and VEGF TKI in the treatment of mRCC.

Prostate Cancer For localized prostate cancer, the treatment paradigm is local treatment, radiation, and surgery. For patients with either relapsed or new metastatic disease, the treatment is androgen ablation. Patients with metastatic prostate cancer become androgen-independent at a median of 18 to 24 months after castration. Once the cancer is androgen-inde-pendent, median survival is 10 to 12 months.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{outcome for}} patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has improved radically in the past 15 years. Imatinib led to high rates of complete cytogenetic responses and improved survival {{for patients with}} this disease. However, approximately 25 - 35 % of patients in chronic phase treated with imatinib developed treatment failure. Development of next-generation Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as dasatinib, nilotinib, radotinib, bosutinib, and ponati-nib, has provided new therapeutic option for the patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Second generation (2 G) TKIs were ac-tive in most clinically relevant BCR-ABL mutations, except highly resistant T 315 I. Through the phase 3 international randomized studies of 2 G TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib) vs. imatinib, 2 G TKIs emerged as the standard treatment for CML and have successfully prolonged the duration of both the chronic phase (CP) and the disease-free state. The majority of newly diagnosed patients treated with 2 G TKIs achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), and over time, most of these eventually achieved major molecular responses (MMRs) and even complete molecular responses (CMRs).

30|$|Hormonal {{therapy is}} {{recommended}} for most women with HR-positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen, a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM), acts as an antagonist of the oestrogen receptor (ER) in breast tissue and as agonist in the uterine endometrium [3]. Recently, another class of hormonal agents, called aromatase inhibitors (AIs), has shown superior efficacy to tamoxifen in the metastatic, neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings in postmenopausal women. Anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane are the three most widely used of these drugs. These agents work by reducing the aromatization of peripheral androgens into oestrogen [4]. Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy has shown an equivalent to superior response compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in HR-positive breast cancer. Studies have demonstrated greater rates of breast-conserving surgery in postmenopausal oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients on neoadjuvant hormonal therapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy [5]. Furthermore, higher rates of breast-conserving surgery have been demonstrated in patients treated with AIs versus tamoxifen [6]. Endocrine therapy has a better toxicity profile and is preferred when chemotherapy cannot be tolerated. Another anti-oestrogen agent, fulvestrant, is an ER antagonist, and unlike tamoxifen, has no agonist effects. Fulvestrant was approved for <b>second-line</b> <b>use</b> in postmenopausal women with HR-positive metastatic breast cancer with disease progression following treatment with an anti-oestrogen [7]. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists (goserelin, leuprolide), progestins (megestrol acetate), androgens (fluoxymesterone) and high-dose oestrogen (ethinyl estradiol) are other hormonal therapies used in the adjuvant and metastatic setting in breast cancer [1].|$|E
40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) is a distressing dermatological disease, {{which is}} highly prevalent during infancy, can persist into later life and requires long-term management with anti-inflammatory compounds. The {{introduction of the}} topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, more than 10 yr ago was a major breakthrough for the topical anti-inflammatory treatment of AD. Pimecrolimus 1 % is approved for <b>second-line</b> <b>use</b> in children (≥ 2 yr old) and adults with mild-to-moderate AD. The age restriction was emphasized in a boxed warning added by the FDA in January 2006, which also highlights the lack of long-term safety data and the theoretical risk of skin malignancy and lymphoma. Since then, pimecrolimus has been extensively investigated in short- and long-term studies including over 4000 infants (< 2 yr old). These studies showed that pimecrolimus effectively treats AD in infants, with sustained improvement with long-term intermittent use. Unlike topical corticosteroids, long-term TCI use does not carry the risks of skin atrophy, impaired epidermal barrier function or enhanced percutaneous absorption, and so is suitable for AD treatment especially in sensitive skin areas. Most importantly, the studies of pimecrolimus in infants provided no evidence for systemic immunosuppression, and a comprehensive body of evidence from clinical studies, post-marketing surveillance and epidemiological investigations does not support potential safety concerns. In conclusion, the authors consider that the labelling restrictions {{regarding the use of}} pimecrolimus in infants are no longer justified and recommend that the validity of the boxed warning for TCIs should be reconsidered...|$|E

40|$|Objective: In Italy, use of {{olanzapine}} in {{the public}} sector was limited by law to patients that had failed treatment with conventional antipsychotics, due to the higher purchase price of the drug. This restriction prevented first-episode patients and patients early {{in the course of their}} illness from being treated with olanzapine. The present study investigates economic consequences of this policy. Design: The present study retrospectively outlines treatment costs of patients switched to olanzapine during the early stages of schizophrenia as compared to the costs of patients switched during a later stage of the illness. Setting: The study was conducted within Italian Community Mental Health Services. Patients: The cost of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment was retrospectively calculated in 25 out-patients with schizophrenia and related disorders over a one-year span. Thirteen patients were switched to olanzapine in the early stage of their illness, prior to drug approval under a compassionate use regimen. Twelve patients started olanzapine under the restriction in a later stage of illness following failed treatment with a conventional antipsychotic. Results: While total treatment costs between the two groups was similar, cost distribution was different. Early Switch patients had higher drug costs and higher rehabilitation costs, while Late Switch patients had higher hospitalisation costs. Conclusions: Small patient numbers and design limitations prevent conclusions being drawn regarding the ultimate impact on outcome and total treatment cost of restriction of olanzapine to <b>second-line</b> <b>use.</b> Despite this, our findings demonstrate that within the context of the Italian CMHS, patients treated with olanzapine while still in the early stages of schizophrenia do not necessarily cost more overall compared to patients who receive olanzapine after failing treatment with a conventional antipsychotic...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND:: Scale-up to {{antiretroviral}} therapy (ART) requires surveillance for HIV drug resistance. With {{the goal}} of attaining 100 % pediatric ART coverage in Cameroon, strategies to limit the spread of HIV resistance among children are very important. METHODS:: From June 2009 through February 2011, 92 HIV- 1 -infected children (41 ART-naive, 51 failing first-line ART) living in Yaoundé, Cameroon, were enrolled; HIV- 1 Prot-RT genotypic resistance testing (GRT) was performed using an inhouse assay. Among 40 children failing first-line ART, treatment response was evaluated at weeks 24 and 48 after treatment was changed, based on GRT results. RESULTS:: The mean age was 72 months both for children who were drug-naive and those failing ART (range: 3 - 144 and 12 - 144, respectively), with a mean viremia of 5. 59 log and 4. 71 log RNA copies/mL, a median CD 4 of 17 % (588 cells/μL) and 23 % (719 cells/μL), respectively. Median time-to-treatment failure was 610 days. A prevalence of 4. 9 % and 90 % drug resistance was observed, respectively, among children who were drug-naive and those failing first-line ART, with circulating recombinant form CRF 02 _AG as the most prevalent clade (58. 6 % and 62 %, respectively). After a change to GRT-based treatment, more than 90 % of children had viremia < 3 log RNA copies/mL at week 24 and confirmed at week 48, with 70 % achieving undetectable viremia, although without correlation to immune response; 97. 5 % had switched to lopinavir/ritonavir-containing regimens.

40|$|A {{key element}} in {{evidence-based}} medicine approaches is the ability for clinicians to evaluate the scientific rigor and relevance of research evidence. In the treatment of diabetes, clinicians make increasingly difficult decisions about which drug regimens are best for their patients with limited evidence-based information. While {{the consensus is that}} metformin should be the initial drug treatment when diet and exercise are not sufficient, clinicians disagree on whether sulfonylureas should remain a suitable therapy after metformin. While this would be improved with further research investigating the comparative safety of therapeutic options, there is also need for better ways to synthesize available information to guide evidence-based decision-making in health services research. Study 1 summarizes the pre-existing evidence on the long-term safety risks associated with sulfonylurea therapy relative to other drug classes. Results from a series of meta-analyses provide some evidence that sulfonylureas are associated with elevated all-cause mortality and cardiovascular risks relative to several other medications, either as a monotherapy or in combination with metformin. Study 2 analyzes the comparative safety of second-line treatment in diabetic patients in the Veterans Health Administration to address gaps in the literature. Results suggest that <b>second-line</b> <b>use</b> of sulfonylureas is associated with increased risks compared to thiazolidinediones. Results also suggest that changes to existing metformin therapy may lead to differential hazards. Clinicians may disagree {{about the quality of the}} evidence as well as the relevancy to their own treatment population. Improvements in methods for evidence-based medicine that take this into account are needed. Study 3 applies an underutilized research method that allows for a more thoughtful synthesis of all available evidence. This framework allows clinicians to incorporate the scientific rigor and relevancy of previous study results when integrating new data into their current knowledge base. Results suggest an elevated risk in all models for sulfonylureas compared to thiazolidinediones and highlight the need to design more focused research to support clinical decision-making around medication safety. This novel application to evidence synthesis shows promise as applied to a health services research problem and has potential as a useful framework in other health services research areas. 2017 - 12 - 09 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) is the most cost-effective nucleos(t) ide treatment for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in the UK, Spain, Italy and France. However, to our knowledge, no published studies have yet evaluated the cost effectiveness of any treatments for CHB in a Canadian setting, where relative prices and management of CHB differ from those in Europe. AIM: Our objective was to determine the cost effectiveness of tenofovir DF compared with other nucleos(t) ide therapies licensed for CHB in Canada from the perspective of publicly funded healthcare payers. METHODS: A Markov model was used to calculate {{the costs and benefits of}} nucleos(t) ide therapy in three groups of patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) -positive and -negative CHB: nucleos(t) ide-naive patients without cirrhosis; nucleos(t) ide-naive patients with compensated cirrhosis; and lamivudine-resistant patients. Disease progression was modelled as annual transitions between 18 disease states. Transition probabilities, quality of life and costs were based on published studies. Health benefits were measured in QALYs. The reference year for costs was 2007 and costs and outcomes were discounted at 5 % per annum. RESULTS: First-line tenofovir DF was the most effective nucleos(t) ide strategy for managing CHB, generating 6. 85 - 9. 39 QALYs per patient. First-line tenofovir DF was also the most cost-effective strategy in all patient subgroups investigated, costing between $Can 43 [*] 758 and $Can 48 [*] 015 per QALY gained compared with lamivudine then tenofovir. First-line tenofovir DF strongly dominated first-line entecavir. Giving tenofovir DF monotherapy immediately after lamivudine resistance developed was less costly and more effective than any other active treatment strategy investigated for lamivudine-resistant CHB, including <b>second-line</b> <b>use</b> of adefovir or adefovir[*]+[*]lamivudine. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated 50 % confidence that first-line tenofovir DF is the most cost-effective nucleos(t) ide strategy for treatment-naive patients with CHB, at a $Can 50 [*] 000 per QALY threshold, and confirmed that first-line tenofovir DF has the highest expected net benefits. CONCLUSIONS: First-line tenofovir DF appears to be the most cost-effective nucleos(t) ide treatment for both cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic CHB patients in Canada, providing that society is willing to pay at least $Can 48 [*] 015 per QALY gained, although sensitivity analyses highlighted uncertainty around the results...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{consider}} the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pimecrolimus for {{mild to moderate}} atopic eczema and tacrolimus for moderate to severe atopic eczema compared with current standard treatment in adults and children. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases. Experts and the manufacturers of these agents were also approached for information. REVIEW METHODS: The systematic review was carried out using standard methodological guidelines and a stringent quality assessment strategy. A state transition (Markov) model was developed to estimate cost [...] utility of tacrolimus and pimecrolimus separately, compared with current standard practice with topical corticosteroids, (a) as first-line treatment and (b) as second-line treatment. Pimecrolimus was also compared to emollients only. RESULTS: The pimecrolimus trial reports were of varying quality; however when compared with a placebo (emollient), pimecrolimus {{was found to be}} more effective and to provide quality of life improvements. There is very little evidence available about pimecrolimus compared with topical corticosteroids. Compared with a placebo (emollient), both 0. 03 % and 0. 1 % tacrolimus were found to be more effective. Compared with a mild corticosteroid, 0. 03 % tacrolimus is more effective in children as measured by a 90 % or better improvement in the Physician's Global Evaluation (PGE). Compared with potent topical corticosteroids, no significant difference in effectiveness is seen with 0. 1 % tacrolimus as measured by a 75 % or greater improvement in the PGE. Minor application site adverse effects are common with tacrolimus. However, this did not lead to increased rates of withdrawal from treatment in trial populations. The PenTag economic model demonstrates a large degree of uncertainty, which was explored in both deterministic and stochastic analyses. This is the case for the cost-effectiveness of pimecrolimus and tacrolimus in first- or <b>second-line</b> <b>use</b> compared with topical steroids. In all cases immunosuppressant regimes were estimated to be more costly than alternatives and differences in benefits to be small and subject to considerable uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence from a small number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that pimecrolimus is more effective than placebo treatment in controlling mild to moderate atopic eczema. Although greater than for pimecrolimus, the evidence base for tacrolimus in moderate to severe atopic eczema is also limited. At both 0. 1 % and 0. 03 % potencies, tacrolimus appears to be more effective than the placebo treatment and mild topical corticosteroids. However, these are not the most clinically relevant comparators. Compared with potent topical corticosteroids, no significant difference was shown. Short-term adverse effects with both immunosuppressants are relatively common, but appear to be mild. Experience of long-term use of the agents is lacking so the risk of rare but serious adverse effects remains unknown. No conclusions can be confidently drawn about the cost-effectiveness of pimecrolimus or tacrolimus compared with active topical corticosteroid comparators. Areas for further research should focus on the effectiveness and safety of the treatments through good-quality RCTs and further economic analysis. [References: 102...|$|E

40|$|Background: Hyperphosphatemia is {{a common}} and {{potentially}} harmful condition in patients with end-stage kidney disease. In Canada, first-line treatment of hyperphosphatemia consists primarily of calcium carbonate (CC). Lanthanum carbonate (LC) and sevelamer hydrochloride (SH) are non-calcium phosphate binders {{that have been used}} as second-line therapy in patients intolerant of or not responsive to CC. Objectives: The primary objective {{of the present study was}} to assess the costs and clinical benefits of <b>second-line</b> <b>use</b> of LC after therapy failure with CC in patients receiving dialysis, from a Canadian payer perspective. The secondary objective was to perform an economic comparison between second-line LC therapy and second-line SH therapy, from a Canadian payer perspective. Short-term outcomes were treatment response and cost per additional responder, and long-term outcomes were survival, number of all-cause hospitalizations, and quality of life. Methods: A cost-effectiveness Markov model was populated with simulated cohorts of 1000 patients receiving incident dialysis, followed life-long. Patients not responsive to CC with a serum phosphate concentration > 1. 78 rarnol/L (> 5. 5 mg/dL) received a trial regimen with LC. Patients not responsive to LC returned to CC therapy. Patient data from a randomized controlled trial of 800 patients receiving dialysis were used. Extensive (probabilistic) sensitivity analyses were performed. When available, model parameters were based on Canadian data or from a Canadian perspective. All costs are in 2010 Canadian dollars (C$). Results: Results of the model estimated that in patients responsive to second-line LC therapy, survival increased, on average, 0. 44 years (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 35 - 0. 54) per patient when compared with continued CC therapy. The mean (range) costs per patient in the first year of treatment with LC was C$ 2600 (C$ 2400 -C$ 2800). Over patients' lifetimes, the second-line LC strategy resulted in a gain of 48. 8 (37. 1 - 61. 3) life-years and 29. 3 (21. 4 - 38. 1) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The cost-effectiveness of the second-line LC strategy was C$ 7900 (C$ 1800 -C$ 14, 600) per life-year and C$ 13, 200 (C$ 3000 -C$ 25, 100) per QALY gained. Most sensitivity analyses did not change the cost-effectiveness outcomes; however, including unrelated future costs raised the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to C$ 159, 500 (95 % confidence interval, C$ 133, 300 -C$ 191, 600) per QALY gained. Compared with second-line SH therapy, second-line LC therapy had similar effectiveness and was 23 % less expensive. Conclusions: Second-line treatment with LC is cost-effective in the treatment of end-stage kidney disease in patients with hyperphosphatemia, from a Canadian payer perspective. Second-line treatment with LC is less expensive, with similar effectiveness as second-line treatment with SH. The primary limitation of health economic evaluations of phosphate binders is the relative scarcity of clinical data on the association between phosphate concentration and long-term outcome.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicohort study of 632 patients > 14 years old receiving second-line therapy for more than 6 months in 27 ART programs in Africa and Asia between January 2001 and October 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical, immunological, virological, and immunovirological failure (first diagnosed episode of immunological or virological failure) rates, and mortality after 6 months of <b>second-line</b> therapy <b>use.</b> Sensitivity analyses were performed using alternative CD 4 cell count thresholds for immunological and immunovirological definitions of failure and for cohort attrition instead of death. RESULTS: The 632 patients provided 740. 7 person-years of follow-up; 119 (18. 8 %) met World Health Organization failure criteria after a median 11. 9 months following the start of second-line therapy (interquartile range [IQR], 8. 7 - 17. 0 months), and 34 (5. 4 %) died after a median 15. 1 months (IQR, 11. 9 - 25. 7 months). Failure rates were lower in those who changed 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) instead of 1 (179. 2 vs 251. 6 per 1000 person-years; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0. 64; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 42 - 0. 96), and higher in those with lowest adherence index (383. 5 vs 176. 0 per 1000 person-years; IRR, 3. 14; 95 % CI, 1. 67 - 5. 90 for < 80 % vs ≥ 95 % [percentage adherent, as represented by percentage of appointments attended with no delay]). Failure rates increased with lower CD 4 cell counts when second-line therapy was started, from 156. 3 vs 96. 2 per 1000 person-years; IRR, 1. 59 (95 % CI, 0. 78 - 3. 25) for 100 to 199 /microL to 336. 8 per 1000 person-years; IRR, 3. 32 (95 % CI, 1. 81 - 6. 08) for less than 50 /microL vs 200 /microL or higher; and decreased with time <b>using</b> <b>second-line</b> therapy, from 250. 0 vs 123. 2 per 1000 person-years; IRR, 1. 90 (95 % CI, 1. 19 - 3. 02) for 6 to 11 months to 212. 0 per 1000 person-years; 1. 71 (95 % CI, 1. 01 - 2. 88) for 12 to 17 months vs 18 or more months. Mortality for those taking second-line therapy was lower in women (32. 4 vs 68. 3 per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0. 45; 95 % CI, 0. 23 - 0. 91); and higher in patients with treatment failure of any type (91. 9 vs 28. 1 per 1000 person-years; HR, 2. 83; 95 % CI, 1. 38 - 5. 80).
