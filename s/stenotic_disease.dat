40|$|The {{relation}} of cigarette smoking to both coronary disease and non-fatal myocardial infarction was examined in a cross sectional study of 1053 women who underwent coronary arteriography. As {{compared with the}} 489 women who had never smoked cigarettes, ever-smokers (mean duration of smoking, 25 years) were 1. 6 {{times as likely to}} have significant <b>stenotic</b> <b>disease</b> and were 1. 9 times as likely to have suffered a myocardial infarction. These associations were strongest in women under 50 years of age, with odds ratios of 3. 5 for coronary artery disease and 4. 5 for myocardial infarction. Although the extent of <b>stenotic</b> <b>disease</b> and prior myocardial infarction were strongly associated, women who smoked cigarettes remained at increased risk of a myocardial infarction even after their increased coronary artery disease had been taken into account. For example, heavy smokers (greater than 30 pack-years) were 2. 3 times as likely to have had a myocardial infarction as were non-smokers; controlling for the extent of <b>stenotic</b> <b>disease</b> (in addition to age and other risk factors) reduced the estimated relative risk to only 1. 9. Stratified analyses showed that this increased risk for clinical disease among smokers was evident at all levels of occlusion, even among women with minimal <b>stenotic</b> <b>disease.</b> These results, collected at the time of arteriography, suggest that non-atherogenic mechanisms may be important in the aetiology of myocardial infarction among women who smoke cigarettes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} effect of mild {{stenosis}} on blood flow, in an irregular axisymmetric artery with oscillating pressure gradient. The Herschel-Bulkley fluid model has been utilized for this study. The combined influence of an asymmetric shape and surface irregularities of constriction has been explored in this computational study. An extensive quantitative analysis has been performed for narrowing of vessels through numerical computations on the flow velocity, plug flow rate and the apparent fluidity. The graphical representations have been made to validate the analytical findings with a view of its applicability to <b>stenotic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Velocity profiles, plug flow rate, and apparent fluidity along the radius of the obstructed tube are determined to give the flow characteristics, for diagnostic point of view.

The equations governing the transport phenomena are non-dimensionalized and the resulting boundary value problem is solved analytically in the steady state subject to physically appropriate boundary conditions. Numerical computations are conducted to quantify the effects of relevant hemodynamic, thermophysical and nanoscale parameters emerging in the model on velocity and temperature profiles, wall shear stress, impedance resistance and also streamline distributions.

40|$|Age-related {{changes in}} the spinal column result in a {{degenerative}} cascade known as spondylosis. Genetic, environmental, and occupational influences may play a role. These spondylotic changes may result in direct compressive and ischemic dysfunction of the spinal cord known as cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). Both static and dynamic factors contribute to the pathogenesis. CSM may present as subclinical stenosis or may follow a more pernicious and progressive course. Most reports of {{the natural history of}} CSM involve periods of quiescent disease with intermittent episodes of neurologic decline. If conservative treatment is chosen for mild CSM, close clinical and radiographic follow-up should be undertaken in addition to precautions for trauma-related neurologic sequelae.

There was good agreement between the diameter of the disturbed region on the Doppler echocardiogram and the diameter of the jet on the lateral angiocardiogram. In severe valve stenosis the agreement between the valve diameters measured by multigated pulsed Doppler and at operation was also good.

40|$|Hand {{ischemia}} {{is a rare}} {{complication of}} diabetes and some other chronic vascular diseases. Critical hand ischemia causes painful limbs and disability and requires urgent revascularization. There {{have been a few}} reports of successful trans-brachial percutaneous angioplasty in the upper extremity in the radial or ulnar artery. Herein, we report the results of the endovascular treatment of a 68 -year-old diabetic patient with an ischemic hand ulcer due to the severe stenotic lesions of the infra-brachial arteries. The patient underwent successful angioplasty via the retrograde trans-femoral technique to avoid the drawbacks. At the first week of post-procedural follow-up, the patient’s finger was warm with a well–healing wound and reduced pain. In the next two months, he had no complaint of pain or active ulceration; the ulcer was well healed, and the hand was warm. The present case shows that history taking and physical examination should be followed by upper-extremity arteriography for the evaluation of hand ischemia. The trans-femoral approach enabled us to perform percutaneous catheterization for both diagnostic and interventional purposes.

40|$|Three aortic {{branches}} {{provide the}} arterial blood {{supply to the}} gastrointestinal tract: the celiac artery (CA), superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). The CA supplies stomach, liver, part of the pancreas and proximal part of the duodenum. The SMA supplies the distal part of the duodenum, the entire small bowel and the proximal colon. The IMA is relatively small and supplies the distal colon. The anatomy of these arteries varies largely and gastrointestinal artery <b>stenotic</b> <b>disease</b> is not uncommon. Occlusive gastrointestinal arterial disease often remains asymptomatic, due {{to the presence of}} abundant collateral circulation. Only patients with significant arterial stenosis in combination with insufficient collateral circulation develop clinical signs of mesenteric ischemia. In these cases, the diagnosis is often missed due to lack of sensitive diagnostic tests. The diagnostic approach in patients with possible chronic gastrointestinal ischemia (CGI) focuses on identification of gastrointestinal arterial stenosis and demonstration of mucosal ischemia. This thesis deals with the diagnosis of chronic gastrointestinal ischemia, which often remains a clinical challenge. This in part explains why CGI was for long considered to be a very rare disease, only presenting in patients with multiple stenotic abdominal arterial disease. The existence of single vessel abdominal arterial disease has long been debated. We therefore firstly reviewed the existence and characteristics of single vessel abdominal arterial disease...|$|E
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONWhen a long aortic {{clamp time}} is {{expected}} or when upper body to lower body collateral arteries are sparse, temporary lower body perfusion {{may be needed}} to reduce ischemic injury during supraceliac clamping in open repair of pararenal aortic aneurysms. The use of conventional extracorporeal perfusion techniques carry extra risks and is not in the armamentarium of most vascular surgeons. An axillo-femoral or -iliac shunt using a vascular prosthesis does not require the same degree of anticoagulation and causes less activation of blood components. PRESENTATION OF CASEA patient, who had extensive vascular <b>stenotic</b> <b>disease</b> and large bowel ischemia, was operated on for a pararenal aortic aneurysm while the lower body was perfused via a temporary extracorporeal vascular prosthesis axillo-iliac shunt. Copious backbleeding encountered while suturing the proximal anastomosis testified to the efficacy of the temporary shunt. A left hemicolectomy had to be performed for gangrene of the sigmoid colon and he needed 2 days of respiratory support; otherwise the postoperative course was uneventful. DISCUSSIONIn our case more ischemic injury than that observed might have been expected without the temporary bypass but significant backbleeding may have negated some of the beneficial effect of the shunt. CONCLUSIONA temporary axillo-femoral or -iliac shunt prevents lower limb ischemia and provides an ample amount of collateral blood flow to the torso. It {{does not need to be}} buried subcutaneously as previously described. Occlusive balloons should be used where possible to prevent backbleeding and to further increase available collateral blood supply...|$|E
40|$|Percutaneous transluminal balloon {{angioplasty}} was attempted in seven patients with {{internal carotid artery}} stenosis, including one patient who had two procedures. All had recurrent, carotid territory, neurological symptoms considered haemodynamic in origin. Six had occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery. Cerebral blood flow studies confirmed diminished cerebrovascular reserve in six patients studied. In five patients (six procedures) angioplasty of the stenosed internal carotid artery was carried out successfully. With two patients technical difficulty in crossing the stenosis prevented angioplasty and in one patient with bilateral stenosis the procedure was not attempted on the second side because {{of the severity of}} the stenosis. In two patients transient aphasia developed during cannulation of the carotid artery and in another a transient monoparesis developed during the procedure. Both these haemodynamic complications recovered within ten minutes. No other complications occurred. Our experience suggests that {{balloon angioplasty}} is technically feasible in the management of <b>stenotic</b> carotid <b>disease</b> associated with haemodynamic stroke. It is a technically simple procedure requiring only a brief admission to hospital.

40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of peak velocity {{is critical to}} the assessment of patients with <b>stenotic</b> valvular <b>disease.</b> Conventional phase contrast (PC) methods for imaging high-velocity jets in aortic stenosis are susceptible to intravoxel dephasing signal loss, which can result in unreliable measurements. The most effective method for reducing intravoxel dephasing is to shorten the echo time (TE); however, the amount that TE can be shortened in conventional sequences is limited. A new sequence incorporating velocity-dependent slice excitation and ultrashort TE (UTE) centric radial readout trajectories is proposed that reduces TE from 2. 85 to 0. 65 ms. In a high-velocity stenotic jet phantom, a conventional sequence had > 5 % flow error at a flow rate of only 400 mL/s (velocity > 358 cm/s), whereas the PC-UTE showed excellent agreement (< 5 % error) at much higher flow rates (1080 mL/s, 965 cm/s). In vivo feasibility studies demonstrated that by measuring velocity over a shorter time the PC-UTE approach is more robust to intravoxel dephasing signal loss. It also has less inherent higher-order motion encoding. This sequence therefore demonstrates potential as a more robust method for measuring peak velocity and flow in high-velocity turbulent stenotic jets...|$|R

40|$|Stroke is an {{important}} cause of death and disability. However, about two thirds of cerebrovascular events are initially minor. They carry {{a high risk of}} potentially severe recurrent events, but they also offer an opportunity for secondary prevention to avoid such recurrences. As most recurrent events occur within a short time after the initial presentation, secondary prevention has to be started as soon as possible. Dramatic risk reduction can be achieved with well-established drugs if used in a timely manner. A standard secondary preventive regimen will address multiple vascular risk factors and will usually consist of an antiplatelet agent, a lipid lowering drug, and an antihypertensive agent. Depending on the risk factor profile of each patient, this will have to be adjusted individually, for example, taking into account the presence of cardioembolism or of <b>stenotic</b> <b>disease</b> of the brain-supplying arteries. In recent years, the approach to treating these risk factors has evolved. In addition to absolute blood pressure, blood pressure variability has emerged as {{an important}} contributing factor to stroke risk, which is affected differently by different antihypertensive agents. New oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of cerebral haemorrhage and the need for regular blood checks. The best antiplatelet regimen for stroke prevention is still uncertain, and treatment of dyslipidaemia may change if trials with cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, which increase levels of HDL-cholesterol, are successful.

40|$|Background and aims: Initiation of a fibrotic {{process has}} been {{suggested}} {{as part of the}} intestinal response to chronic inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease. YKL- 40 has been proposed as a new serum marker of fibrosis. We studied compared the serum levels of YKL- 40 in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease with inflammatory and healthy controls. Patients and methods: YKL- 40 serum levels were measured in 179 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (94 ulcerative colitis, 85 Crohn's disease), in 23 with intestinal inflammation of other causes, and 70 matched healthy controls using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. YKL- 40 levels were assessed in terms of disease activity, type and localization. Results: Mean serum YKL- 40 levels were 102. 6 +/- 82. 7 ng/ml in ulcerative colitis patients and 112. 2 +/- 83. 7 ng/ml in Crohn's disease patients, significantly higher than in healthy controls (64. 1 +/- 21. 4 ng/ml) but not significantly different from inflammatory controls (77. 8 +/- 23. 1 ng/ml). Disease activity and C-reactive protein levels were significantly correlated with YKL- 40 levels in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease patients with ileum localization had significantly higher YKL- 40 levels than those with ileocolonic or colonic disease. Patients with <b>stenotic</b> <b>disease</b> had mean YKL- 40 levels not significantly different than those with nonstenotic disease. Conclusion: Serum levels of YKL- 40 are increased in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and this is associated with the inflammatory process rather than with the degree of fibrosis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the usefulness of gadolinum-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for defining anatomic features relevant to performing aortic surgery for aneurysmal disease. Methods: Anatomic data defined by MRA, including abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) size and character, as well as the status of the celiac, mesenteric, renal, and iliac arteries, were correlated with angiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, or operative data in 43 patients. Five MRA sequences were obtained in an hour-long examination optimized for aortoiliac, splanchnic, and renal artery imaging at 1. 5 T in a body coil. Four of the sequences were performed during or after infusion of gadolinium to improve image quality. Results: MRA correctly defined the maximum aneurysm diameter, as well as its proximal and distal extent in all patients. MRA detected 33 of 35 significant stenoses among 153 splanchnic, renal, or iliac branches examined (sensitivity = 94 % and specificity = 98 %). MRA did not resolve the degree of aortic branch <b>stenotic</b> <b>disease</b> sufficiently to precisely grade its severity. MRA did not reliably define the status of the inferior mesenteric artery, lumbar arteries or internal iliac arteries. One ruptured AAA and one inflammatory AAA were correctly diagnosed by MRA. No patient had a contrast reaction or contrast-induced renal toxicity related to administration of gadolinium. Conclusion: Gadolinium-enhanced MRA of AAA provides appropriate, essential anatomic information for aortic reconstructive surgery in a 1 -hour examination devoid of contrast-related renal toxicity or catheterization-related complications attending conventional arteriography.

The objective was to determine risk factors predictive of mortality and severe complications in patients with aortic valve replacement, and analyze the behavior of two models of preoperative risk stratification in cardiac surgery. Methods: A non-experimental investigation of prospective follow-up was performed with 113 patients who underwent aortic valve replacement at the Department of Cardiac Surgery of "Ernesto Che Guevara" Cardiology Hospital of Villa Clara, in the years 2007 - 2009. To determine the predictors, two bivariate studies were carried out in which the dependents were mortality and the presence of serious complications. For analysis and validation of scales applied to operated patients the diagnostic yield curves were used. Results: Patients had a mean age of 55. 7 years and were predominantly male. Hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease were the risk factors most frequently found. All patients were electively operated on, with functional class II and III, and there was a prevalence of <b>stenotic</b> valvular <b>disease.</b> The variables that significantly affected the risk of death and serious complications were age, ejection fraction, associated ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, preoperative renal failure and a history of stroke. Conclusions: Both used risk scores have good discriminating power for predicting mortality and severe complications...|$|R
40|$|Complex fistulas of the {{duodenum}} and biliary tree are {{severe complications}} of gastric surgery. The association of duodenal and major biliary fistulas occurs rarely {{and is a}} major challenge for treatment. They may occur during virtually any kind of operation, but they are more frequent in cases complicated {{by the presence of}} difficult duodenal ulcers or cancer, with a mortality rate of up to 35 %. Options for treatment are many and range from simple drainage to extended resections and difficult reconstructions. Conservative treatment is the choice for well-drained fistulas, but some cases require reoperation. Very little is known about reoperation techniques and technical selection of the right patients. We present the case of a complex iatrogenic duodenal and biliary fistula. A 42 -year-old Caucasian man with a diagnosis of postoperative peritonitis had been operated on 3 days earlier; an antrectomy with a Roux-en-Y reconstruction for <b>stenotic</b> peptic <b>disease</b> was performed. Conservative treatment was attempted with mixed results. Two more operations were required to achieve a definitive resolution of the fistula and related local complications. The decision was made to perform a pancreatoduodenectomy with subsequent reconstruction on a double jejunal loop. The patient did well and was discharged on postoperative day 17. In our experience pancreaticoduodenectomy may be an effective treatment of refractory and complex iatrogenic fistulas involving both the duodenum and the biliary tree...|$|R
40|$|Non-invasive {{diagnostic}} {{techniques such}} as electron beam computed tomography and multislice spiral computed tomography are able to detect and quantify coronary calcifications. Several clinical studies have shown how the amount of coronary calcifications correlates to the coronary plaque burden. The detection of coronary calcium therefore provides {{a unique opportunity to}} identify and quantify coronary atherosclerosis in a subclinical stage. Measures of subclinical atherosclerosis may also help in recognizing factors related to atherosclerosis in asymptomatic populations. In addition, a significant proportion of subjects who develop premature clinical disease are not identified as being at high risk by current strategies. A scan negative for coronary calcium has a high negative predictive value indicating the absence of <b>stenotic</b> coronary artery <b>disease.</b> The aim of this review was to describe the potentials of coronary calcium detection and to summarize its clinical relevance.
