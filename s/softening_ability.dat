40|$|Background : Today {{the use of}} {{hygienic}} {{products with}} a natural source is of high interest among consumers. Lavender essence (Lavandula Officinalis) owing to its pleasant odor and also its antibacterial, antifugal, and antiviral effects {{can be used in}} dermatological preparations. Hence, the aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the physicochemical characteristics of a formulated liquid soap from this essence as a new hygienic/therapeutic product. Materials and methods : 0. 5 of the essence was extracted from the lavender plant and added to a liquid soap base prepared in preliminary studies, then the prepared product was evaluated in terms of the visual characteristics, color, odor, cleansing and foaming ability, ease of washing from the skin, skin <b>softening</b> <b>ability,</b> compatibility with the skin, PH, and total active determination of the product, determination of the volume and durability of the foam and mechanical and thermal stability. Results : The prepared product had a clear appearance. It was homogenous, with a suitable viscosity and free of suspended particles or sedimentation and possess a pleasant odor. It had a good cleansing ability and could produce an appropriate amount of stable and durable foam and could be easily washed away with water after use. Consumption of the formulated liquid soap softens the skin and causes no side effects such as skin dryness, rash, sensitivity, etc. PH and the total active (total amount of surfactants present in the formulation) of the products were 7. 21 Â± 0. 02 and 18. 15 Â± 0. 04 respectively. Finally, the product was found to have desirable mechanical and thermal stability. Conclusion : Results have revealed that the formulated liquid soap containing lavender essence is acceptable as a new fragment product with cleansing and hygienic ability...|$|E
40|$|Bromelain is {{the generic}} name {{given to the}} set of derived endopeptidases {{belonging}} {{to members of the}} Bromeliaceae family, which belongs to the pineapple (Ananas comosus), being able to break the peptide bond, separating proteins and amino acids [1]. Bromelain possesses a wide range of therapeutic benefit as property of facilitating digestion of proteins, meat <b>softening,</b> <b>ability</b> to facilitate blood clotting [2] And economic importance related to the food industry and textiles and production of drugs resulting in an increase of its value [3]. Thus, the aim of this work is to evaluate the stability of the enzyme in relation to different temperatures and pH to make feasible the purification of the same. Methods The enzyme extract was obtained from the peel, stem and leaves of (Ananas comosus). The plant tissue derived from the peel, stem and leaves of pineapple were processed extractor and then centrifuged at 10, 000 g for 20 minutes at 4 ° C to remove insoluble material. For the assay of enzymatic activity was used azocasein method, wherein azocasein 1, 0 % (w / v) (Sigma) was solubilized in ethanol 4 % (v / v) and 0. 1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7. 0, and used as a substrate. The assay mixture, containing 125 μL of substrate and 125 μL of enzymatic extract was incubated for 10 minutes at 37 ° C and the reaction stopped by add-ing 750 μL of trichloroacetic acid 5 % (w / v). The samples were centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 minutes and at a tem-perature of 5 ° C. The stability of bromelain was evaluated against various pHs (5. 0, 6. 0, 7. 0, 8. 0, and 9. 0 and 10. 0...|$|E
40|$|A {{fabrication}} {{scheme to}} realize a flow sensor array for operation in liquid which biomimics fish lateral line is presented. The configuration enables differential capacitive sensing upon {{rotation of the}} metal electrodes under the membrane due to deflection of a receptive hair by drag force of the fluid flow. The capacitive readout provides high sensitivity, low power consumption and electrostatic <b>softening</b> <b>ability</b> [1]. Prevention of electrode/liquid contact and elimination of the chance of electrolysis and short circuiting are essential {{in the design and}} have been fulfilled with a fully supported membrane with electrodes underneath. The gap between two counter electrodes can be tuned by the thickness of a sacrificial polysilicon layer to optimize the sensor for the highest sensitivity considering the static downward deflection of the membrane due to pressure difference. An optimized DRIE process to access a sacrificial layer from the backside of the wafer provides a suitable procedure to realize dense arrays of hair sensors. The shape and length of SU- 8 hairs can also be optimized for higher drag force and therefore more mechanical deformation of the membrane which leads to higher device sensitivity. The process flow not only allows for highly controllable distance between counter electrodes but also provides the design freedom to either use SU- 8 or SiRN (Silicon Rich Nitride) membranes. It begins with a DRIE step from the frontside to define etch ports followed by oxidation of the Si surface followed by Si 3 N 4 deposition which acts as an etch/oxidation stop. Then poly-silicon, as sacrificial layer, is deposited and the device area is defined by trench-etching. This is followed by a SiRN layer deposition. Afterwards, vias are etched to access etch ports, followed by oxidation to protect sidewalls during sacrificial layer etch. For SiRN membranes electrical connections are formed by heavily doped poly silicon which stands the etch process. In case of SU- 8 membranes the front SiRN is etched directionally and SU- 8 spun on after electrode deposition. Using this procedure we have successfully realized arrays of fully supported membranes with very high yield. [1] G. J. M.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} impact of {{consumer}} protection policies on consumer incentives to become informed of the best deals available in the market. In a market with costly consumer search, we find that imposing a cap on suppliers' prices reduces the incentive to engage in search, {{with the result that}} prices paid by consumers (both informed and uninformed) may rise. In a related model where consumers have the ability to refuse to receive marketing, we find that this <b>ability</b> <b>softens</b> price competition and can make all consumers worse off. ...|$|R
40|$|Soap {{is defined}} as {{compound}} of fats, fatty acids and caustics soda. Thesecompounds work to reduce surface tension and increase its cleansing ability. The term “detergent” usually refer to synthetics compounds, but has broader ability, not only reducing surface tension and increasing its cleansing ability but also has <b>softening</b> and emulsifying <b>ability.</b> Unfortunately, detergent in certain concentration can harm to aquatic organism such as plankton, mussel, mollusk and fish. In bioassays test, high detergent concentrations induced mortality in gill cells and reduced filtration rate of the mussel. In some report cited said that concentrations above 0. 2 mg/L of anionic detergent already elicited detrimental, and sub-lethal effects in all test organisms. Therefore, in upper Citarum Catchments Area which has detergent concentration significantly above 0. 2 mg/L could harm to sessile invertebrate organisms. And in the long period it may influence the diver and abundance of aquatic organisms...|$|R
