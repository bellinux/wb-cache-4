Seven units were chosen by simple random and proportionate sampling was done to get 330 <b>staff</b> <b>nurses.</b> Data was obtained through a self-administered questionnaire. The response rate was 92. 4 %. Based on ethnicity, 77. 4 % of the respondents were Malay, 15. 4 % Chinese and 7. 2 % Indians. Generally, respondents were dissatisfied with workload and rewards while they were satisfied with interpersonal staff relationships and with status and autonomy. Meanwhile they had neutral attitude towards career development. This study found that 56. 4 % of <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> were generally satisfied while 27. 6 % were dissatisfied with their jobs and the remainder were neutral. With regards to intention to resign within the next one year. 28. 9 % of the respondents had no intention to resign at all while 19. 3 % of respondents had 100 % intention to resign from their jobs. Initial analysis found no associations between the social demography factors like ethnicity, age, marital status, duration of service as <b>staff</b> <b>nurses,</b> income and duration of contract as <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> with general job satisfaction (p > 0. 05).

40|$|Background/rationale. In the Republic of Ireland, {{the amount}} of {{clinical}} teaching expected of <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> has increased substantially {{in the wake of}} the transfer of nursing education to universities, and the advent of supernumerary status for students. A modicum of previous research noted that <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> are unclear about their role in relation to facilitating the clinical learning of supernumerary students [...] Aims of the paper. To explore <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of their role in the facilitation of learning for university-educated diploma students in the clinical area and their attitudes towards these students [...] Design/methods. Sixteen <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> were interviewed in depth using semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed qualitatively, using content analysis, with the help of the software package NUD*IST [...] Findings. Among the central themes to emerge, upon which this article is focused, was participants 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of supernumerary status compared with rostered service for diploma students. Data suggested that the rostered status of students was generally favoured by <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> over and above supernumerary status because, unlike supernumerary students, rostered students did not disrupt the existing social structure within the clinical setting. Both structuration theory and role theory are drawn upon to explain the reproduction of the prevailing social structure, where the concentration is on getting through nursing work with little emphasis on the supervised learning of supernumerary students [...] Study limitations. This study is constrained by eliciting only the views of <b>staff</b> <b>nurses.</b> Further studies are required of student nurses 2 ̆ 7 experiences of rostered service and supernumerary status [...] Conclusions. Because <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> are part of the system within which they work, they need to modify their role to include active student teaching as a legitimate component of that role. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{position}} of the head sister viewed by a medical staff member My thesis examines the {{position of}} the head sister from the viewpoint of <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> both in state-run and private health care facilities. It gives insight into contacts between the head sister and <b>staff</b> <b>nurses,</b> especially if <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> are informed enough about the head sister´s duties. The results obtained in state-run and private health care facilites are compared. The following hypotheses were set: H I - <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> get into a personal contact with the head sister at least twice a year; H II { [...] } <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> are informed about the duties of the head sister; H III { [...] } <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> working in hospitals, Inc., get into personal contacts with the head sister more often than <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> working in teaching hospitals. I set up thirty questions to address the issues of the {{position of the}} head sister in the hospital management and her duties. To obtain as much as possible information and to involve as many as possible respondents, the quantitative method of a questionnaire was used. The questionnaire consisted mainly of closed and semi-closed questions. One open question was also included to enable the respondents to express their own opinions. Respondents from the teaching hospital in Plzen and several other hospitals in the Plzen region (the hospital Primaved, the Mulac hospital, the hospital in Stod, the hospital in Domazlice) took part in the investigation. The results of the investigation were processed in two phases: first the overall summary of all the replies was made and in the second phase the replies of the particular groups of respondents were evaluated separately. The investigation shows that <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> come into contact with the head sister and are familiar with her duties.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare and contrast responses of two groups of nurses to situational case studies relative to death and dying, with particular emphasis on euthanasia. One group of nurses was comprised of selected faculty of the 33 member universities of the Nurse Faculty Research Development in the Midwest. The second group of study participants was selected <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> of hospitals utilized by each of the universities in the Nurse Faculty Research Development in the Midwest. Special consideration was given to demographic data relative to age, highest level of education attained, marital status, number of classroom hours spent in the study of death, dying, and euthanasia during the basic nursing program, and present work assignment. The population of the study consisted of a total of 184 academic and <b>staff</b> <b>nurses.</b> Ninety of the nurses participating in the study were faculty members of institutions of higher education, and 94 <b>nurses</b> were <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> in hospitals utilized by the institutions of higher education. A search of the literature revealed no instrument dealing with euthanasia as it related to the nurse. An opinionnaire was designed specifically for the study {{because of a lack of}} an instrument in the area of euthanasia. The data collected from the opinionnaires were developed into a series of tables. The tables were designed to illustrate the number and percentage of academic and <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> responding to each situation in the opinionnaire. A comparison was made of the responses of the academic and <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> to determine similarities or dissimilarities in the response patterns. Conclusions based upon the review of the literature and findings of the study were: 1. <b>Staff</b> <b>nurses</b> have more formal education relating to euthanasia than academic nurses. 2. The number of classroom hours spent in the study of death and dying during basic nursing education has increased within the past ten years. 3. <b>Staff</b> and academic <b>nurses</b> support the right of parents to make determinations regarding procedures utilized with infants that result in euthanasia. 4. The greater number of nurses do not support the conclusion that the removal of life-support systems would be murder. 5. A consensus of opinion does not exist between academic and <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> regarding the authority of a physician to determine which individual would have priority in the use of a hemodialysis machine. 6. There is an absence of agreement among academic and <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> regarding the allocation of scarce resources such as blood. 7.

The theoretical framework is Duldt's Humanistic Nursing Communication Theory (Hersey & Duldt, 1989). The population was all <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> and first-line supervisors employed in inpatient services at a midwest hospital. The sample was comprised of about 231 registered nurses and 61 % first-line supervisors who volunteered to answer the Job-Communication Satisfaction Importance Questionnaire (JCSI).

25|$|In 1924, he {{returned}} without his wife {{but with an}} Oxford undergraduate, Noel Gillespie, as assistant. Everything was heavily decayed, and building and doctoring progressed together for months. He now had salvarsan for treating syphilitic ulcers and framboesia. Additional medical <b>staff,</b> <b>nurse</b> (Miss) Kottmann and Dr. Victor Nessmann, joined him in 1924, and Dr. Mark Lauterberg in 1925; the growing hospital was manned by native orderlies. Later Dr. Trensz replaced Nessmann, and Martha Lauterberg and Hans Muggenstorm joined them. Joseph also returned. In 1925-6, new hospital buildings were constructed, and also a ward for white patients, so that the site became like a village. The onset of famine and a dysentery epidemic created fresh problems. Much of the building work was carried out {{with the help of}} local people and patients. Drug advances for sleeping sickness included Germanin and tryparsamide. Trensz conducted experiments showing that the non-amoebic strain of dysentery was caused by a paracholera vibrion (facultative anaerobic bacteria). With the new hospital built and the medical team established, Schweitzer returned to Europe in 1927, this time leaving a functioning hospital at work.|$|E
40|$|Background: Within the United Kingdom (UK), Scotland {{has shown}} to have the highest alcohol {{consumption}} rate {{and as a result}} of such high alcohol consumption – and drinking at harmful and hazardous levels - 25 people die in Scotland each week (Alcohol Focus Scotland 2013). In order to reduce the amount of alcohol consumed, within Scotland, the Scottish Government (2009) introduced alcohol brief interventions within accident and emergency (A&E) departments, which have been shown to reduce both hospital readmissions and costs to the National Health Service (NHS) (Beeston et al. 2012). Therefore, it is necessary to ascertain what knowledge A&E <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> have regarding ABIs to ensure that A&E <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> are following the ABI process with any hazardous or harmful drinkers admitted to the A&E department. Aims: As a result of reviewing the literature, the research proposal aims to describe A&E <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> knowledge regarding the ABI process, to identify whether or not A&E <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> can recognise the main stages of an ABI and to determine whether or not further education and training is required for A&E <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> in order to meet their learning needs. By doing so, this would help to ensure the continuous implementation of evidence based care for both harmful and hazardous drinkers. Methods: The proposed research study will adopt a quantitative approach, using a descriptive survey design in order to achieve the studies aims. The survey will include an online questionnaire which will be made accessible to all A&E <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> within NHS Lothian who meet a certain inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data collected would be analysed using descriptive statistics including the frequencies and medians of the data collected...|$|R

Purpose. To investigate sleep quality of hospital <b>staff</b> <b>nurses,</b> both by subjective questionnaire and objective measures. Methods. Female <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> at a regional teaching hospital in Northern Taiwan were recruited. The Chinese version of the pittsburgh sleep quality index (C-PSQI) {{was used to assess}} subjective sleep quality, and an electrocardiogram-based cardiopulmonary coupling (CPC) technique was used to analyze objective sleep stability. Work stress was assessed using questionnaire on medical worker’s stress. Results. A total of 156 <b>staff</b> <b>nurses</b> completed the study. Among the <b>staff</b> <b>nurses,</b> 75. 8 % (117) had a PSQI score of ≥ 5 and 39. 8 % had an inadequate stable sleep ratio on subjective measures. Nurses with a high school or lower educational degree had a much higher risk of sleep disturbance when compared to nurses with a college or higher level degree. Conclusions. Both subjective and objective measures demonstrated that poor sleep quality is a common health problem among hospital <b>staff</b> <b>nurses.</b> More studies are warranted on this important issue to discover possible factors and therefore to develop a systemic strategy to cope with th...|$|R
