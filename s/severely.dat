5|$|Heraclius's {{defeat of}} the Persians ended a war that {{had been going on}} {{intermittently}} for almost 400 years and led to instability in the Persian Empire. Kavadh II died only months after assuming the throne, plunging Persia into several years of dynastic turmoil and civil war. Ardashir III, Heraclius's ally Shahrbaraz, and Khosrau's daughters Purandokht and Azarmidokht all succeeded to the throne within months of each other. Only when Yazdgerd III, a grandson of Khosrau II, succeeded to the throne in 632 was there stability.

Southern right and sperm were most <b>severely</b> hunted among these, hence the area was called the Middle Ground by whalers. It is likely that these two were once seasonal residents around the island where right whales prefer sheltered, very shallow bays while sperm whales mainly inhabit deep waters.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lili caused great {{environmental}} {{damage to the}} marshes and barrier islands in Louisiana. Huge fish kills were observed in marshes near the landfall point, and in the Atchafalaya Swamp. The barrier islands {{to the east of}} the landfall point, those subjected to the highest surge, were <b>severely</b> eroded. Sand was also deposited behind them into the brackish marshes, burying vegetation. The freshwater marshes were <b>severely</b> damaged by the wind and surge, some of them completely destroyed. The severe erosion created new waterways connecting inland bodies of water with the Gulf of Mexico, which eventually led to further erosion of inland lagoons.|$|E
