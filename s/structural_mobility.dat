50|$|As {{bishop and}} {{chairperson}} of the EKD’s Council Huber initiated and supported numerous reform programs. In {{the context of the}} challenges mainline Protestantism face, especially in the eastern parts of Germany, Huber advocated for a missionary reorientation of the church. For him church reform is closely connected to the rediscovery of the church’s evangelical essence and requires openness to those who have distanced themselves from the Christian faith. These impulses characterize the large-scale reform process, subsumed under the theme “Church of freedom”, which Huber headed. The document Kirche der Freiheit describes how the church can set its profile in society, whilst respecting societal plurality. This document formulates four goals for the reform of the Protestant church in Germany, namely (a) spiritual profiling instead of indistinct activity, (b) prioritising instead of aiming for completeness, (c) <b>structural</b> <b>mobility</b> and (d) shifting the focus of the activities of the church to the outside instead of self-contentment. In his own regional church Huber also oversaw a reform process, “Salt of the earth”. Huber’s tenure as {{chairperson of the}} EKD’s Council also saw the incorporation of the Vereinigte Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche Deutschlands and the Union Evangelischer Kirchen with the EKD, the streamlining of regional churches from 23 to 21, and the initiation of further reform processes.|$|E

Geographic mobility is the most frequent, concerning an average 4. 2 % of staff every year. Not including upgrading (from grade D to grade C and from primary school teacher to secondary school teacher), the annual rate of socio-economic mobility is approximately 3. 5 %. In nearly 90 % of cases, this type of mobility relates to staff promotions. <b>Structural</b> <b>mobility</b> is in last place with a fairly erratic rate that fell from 2 % in 1989 to 0. 8 % in 1996 before rising to 1. 1 % in 2000.

40|$|<b>Structural</b> <b>mobility</b> criteria, {{such as the}} {{well-known}} Chebychev-Kutzbach-Grübler (CKG) formula, give the correct generic mobility of a linkage (possibly of a certain class, e. g. planar, spherical, spatial) provided {{that it is not}} topologically overconstrained. As a matter of fact all known <b>structural</b> <b>mobility</b> criteria are prone to topological redundancies. In this paper a combinatorial algorithm is introduced that determines the correct generic/topological mobility of any planar and spherical mechanism. The algorithm also yields a set of independent links that can be used as input, as well as the redundantly constrained sub-linkages. A mathematical proof of the algorithm and the underlying mathematical concept is presented. The proposed method relies on an established algorithm developed within combinatorial rigidity theory, called pebble game, originally developed for checking the rigidity/immobility of constraint graphs. A novel theorem is introduced and later proved in the paper which in turn enables applying the algorithm to any holonomic planar or spherical mechanism with higher and lower kinematic pairs and multiple joints. A further important result of applying this algorithm is that it gives rise to a decomposition into Assur graphs mentioned, which is briefly discussed in this paper. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>structural</b> <b>mobility</b> in molecular dynamics {{plays a key}} role in data interpreta-tion, particularly in the simulation of biomolecules. The most common mobility measures computed from simulations are the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) and Root Mean Square Fluctuations (RMSF) of the structures. These are computed after the alignment of atomic coordinates in each trajectory step to a reference structure. This rigid-body align-ment is not robust, in the sense that if a small portion of the structure is highly mobile, the RMSD and RMSF increase for all atoms, resulting possibly in poor quantification of the structural fluctuations and, often, to overlooking important fluctuations associated to biologi-cal function. The motivation of this work is to provide a robust measure of <b>structural</b> <b>mobility</b> that is practical, and easy to interpret. We propose a Low-Order-Value-Optimization (LOVO) strategy for the robust alignment of the least mobile substructures in a simulation. These substructures are automatically identified by the method. The algorithm consists of the iterative superposition of the fraction of structure displaying the smallest displacements. Therefore, the least mobile substructures are identified, providing a clearer picture of the overall structural fluctuations. Examples are given to illustrate the interpretative advantages of this strategy. The software for performing the alignments was named MDLovoFit and it is available as free-software at...|$|E
40|$|A new {{procedure}} {{for the low}} frequency Transmission Loss (TL) characterization of panels, {{by means of a}} small reverberant transmission suite is discussed. Moreover, in the case of lightweight panels the measurements are affected by a strong vibro-acoustic coupling between the sample tested and the fluid in the cabin, resulting in an unreliable TL prediction below the Schroeder’s frequency. This paper proposes a novel methodology to retrieve the <b>structural</b> interface <b>mobility</b> matrix of lightweight panels, unaffected by the fluid coupling, using the Patch transfer Function (PTF) sub-structuring method. The retrieved mobility matrix allows then for reliable and standard-like TL predictions in different environments. This new approach has been numerically validated by a simple reference case of a homogeneous Aluminium plate coupled to a small cabin with simply supported boundary condition. The results show a very good matching between the known reference mobility and the estimated one. The limitations of this new procedure, possible applications and further studies are also discussed. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Research on {{migration}} decisionmaking {{has been}} {{centered on the}} notion that residential satisfaction and mobility intentions are intervening variables which fully mediate the effects of structural factors on moving behavior. Results from empirical studies, however, have rendered only modest support for this view. The author examines the role of residential satisfaction and <b>mobility</b> intentions vis-�-vis <b>structural</b> variables in migration decisionmaking with the aid of data drawn from the 1985 - 1989 waves of the American Housing Survey. A conceptual model is derived which is based on behavioral theories developed in social psychology, namely the theories of reasoned action and planned behavior. Several previously ignored links among <b>structural</b> variables, <b>mobility</b> predispositions, and moving behavior are incorporated. Empirical analyses show that, although satisfaction and intentions are important predictors of mobility, most of the structural variables that are commonly known to be related to migration also have direct effects on subsequent moving behavior, independent of satisfaction and intentions. The theories of reasoned action and planned behavior provide a theoretical framework for {{a better understanding of the}} complex relationships between structural variables, residential satisfaction, mobility intentions, and behavior. ...|$|R

40|$|The article {{views the}} current {{financial}} crisis from {{the background of}} long term socio-economic changes in ad-vanced industrial societies. Central points are the rise of middle classes, the accumulation of financial wealth in the upper strata of middle classes in combination with an increasing concentration of financial assets {{at the level of}} the top rich, and the advance of pension and investment funds as collective actors at financial markets. The paper analyses the interconnections between these developments in the framework of a multilevel model, culminating in the thesis of a collective “Buddenbrooks”-effect: a <b>structural</b> upward <b>mobility</b> of society will lead to an increasing imbalance at capital markets because a strongly rising volume of financial assets searching profitable investment opportunities will go parallel with a decline of the social reservoir of solvent entrepre-neurial debtors. Therefore, advanced industrial economies are faced with chronic excess liquidity and export surpluses at capital markets, leading to the build-up of speculative bubbles and subsequent crashes. The author argues that the present crisis cannot be understood properly without taking account of these backgrounds. I.
