5|$|As Diệm had {{strongly}} discriminated {{in favor}} of minority Catholics and placed restrictions on Buddhism, the rebels' radio addresses caused an unsurprisingly negative response among the Buddhist majority. The Buddhist activist monk Thich Tam Chau <b>spoke</b> <b>from</b> a radio station in Nha Trang, exhorting his co-religionists to support the incumbent junta. The Diemist speeches also alarmed pro-Buddhist or anti-Diệm generals, such as Thi and Có, who {{had been part of}} the failed 1960 and successful 1963 coups against Diệm respectively, and feared retribution from Thảo and Phát. The speeches drove many anti-Diệm officers who may have otherwise been neutral or sympathetic to the coup, to swing more towards Khánh.|$|E

25|$|Necessarily {{much of the}} {{information}} in this large compilation varies in value. The Panarion reflects the character of Epiphanius and his method of working. Sometimes, his intense passion prevents him from inquiring carefully into the doctrines he opposes. Thus, on his own avowal (Haer., lxxi), he speaks of Apollinarianism on hearsay. At Constantinople, he had to acknowledge to the Origenist monks, whom he opposed, that he was not acquainted with either their school or their books, and that he only <b>spoke</b> <b>from</b> hearsay (Sozomen, Hist. eccl., VIII, xl). There is, however, much information not found elsewhere. Chapters devoted only to the doctrinal refutation of heresies are rare. As an apologist, Epiphanius appeared generally weak to Photius.|$|E

500|$|Symeon the New Theologian (sometimes spelled [...] "Simeon") ( [...] ; 949–1022 AD) was a Byzantine Christian monk {{and poet}} {{who was the}} last of three saints canonized by the Eastern Orthodox church and given the title of [...] "Theologian" [...] (along with John the Apostle and Gregory of Nazianzus). [...] "Theologian" [...] was not applied to Symeon in the modern {{academic}} sense of theological study; the title was designed only to recognize someone who <b>spoke</b> <b>from</b> personal experience of the vision of God. One of his principal teachings was that humans could and should experience theoria (literally [...] "contemplation," [...] or direct experience of God).|$|E

[...] For the characterization and design for Jim Hawkins, John Ripa cited James Dean as an important reference because [...] "there was a whole attitude, a posture" [...] wherein [...] "you felt the pain and the youthful innocence", and he also cited the film Braveheart because [...] "there are a lot of close-ups on characters...who are going through thought processes, just using their eyes." ...|$|E
500|$|Poland under Gomułka's {{rule was}} {{generally}} described {{as one of}} the more [...] "liberal" [...] communist regimes. However, Poles could still go to prison for writing political satire about the party leader, as Janusz Szpotański did, or for publishing a book abroad. A March 1964 [...] "Letter of the 34", signed by leading intellectuals and delivered to the office of Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz, criticized the worsening censorship and demanded a more open cultural policy, as guaranteed by the Constitution. Jacek Kuroń and Karol Modzelewski were expelled from the party and from 1965 imprisoned for written criticism (the Open Letter to the Party) of the party rule and pointing out the contradictory nature of the supposedly workers' state. Kuroń and Modzelewski accused the regime of betraying the revolutionary cause; like many younger Polish reformers, they <b>spoke</b> <b>from</b> leftist positions and were ideologically closely aligned with Western radicals of the 1960s.|$|E

500|$|The sensationalism in {{the press}} that started before the trial {{continued}} throughout the trial, the appeals process, the commutation decision, and beyond. At the time, local papers were the dominant source of information, {{but they were not}} entirely anti-Frank. The Constitution alone assumed Frank's guilt, while both the Georgian and the Journal would later comment about the public hysteria in Atlanta during the trial, each suggesting the need to reexamine the evidence against the defendant. [...] On March 14, 1914, while the extraordinary motion hearing was pending, the Journal called for a new trial, saying that to execute Frank based on the atmosphere both within and outside the courtroom would [...] "amount to judicial murder." [...] Other newspapers in the state followed suit and many ministers <b>spoke</b> <b>from</b> the pulpit supporting a new trial. L. O. Bricker, the pastor of the church attended by Phagan's family, said that based on [...] "the awful tension of public feeling, it was next to impossible for a jury of our fellow human beings to have granted him a fair, fearless and impartial trial." ...|$|E

He thanked God and his mother, as well as the people that helped him in baseball. Because his idol was Muhammad Ali, Henderson decided to use the words [...] "greatest of all time." [...] These words have since been taken by many to support the notion that Henderson is selfish and arrogant, although years later, Henderson revealed that he had gone over his planned remarks ahead of time with Brock, and the Cardinals Hall of Famer [...] "had no problem with it. In fact, he helped me write what I was going to say that day." [...] On the day of the speech, Brock later told reporters amiably, [...] "He <b>spoke</b> <b>from</b> his heart."

Brock pronounced the young speedster as the heir to his record, saying, [...] "How are we gonna break it?" ...|$|E
500|$|The Maharishi had {{arranged}} a simple lifestyle for his guests, which included stone cottages and vegetarian meals taken outdoors in a communal setting. The days {{were devoted to}} meditating and attending lectures by the Maharishi, who <b>spoke</b> <b>from</b> a flower-bedecked platform in an auditorium. The Maharishi also gave private lessons to the individual Beatles, nominally due to their late arrival. The tranquil environment provided by the Maharishi – complete with meditation, relaxation, {{and away from the}} media throng – helped the band to relax. Harrison told Saltzman, [...] "Like, we're The Beatles after all, aren't we? We have all the money you could ever dream of. We have all the fame you could ever wish for. But, it isn't love. It isn't health. It isn't peace inside, is it?" [...] Lennon was respectful of the Maharishi but not in awe of him. At their first meeting Donovan remembers that the Maharishi was [...] "amiable but non-talkative", and during an awkward silence Lennon walked across the room and patted the Maharishi on the head, saying, [...] "There's a good little guru" [...] while the room erupted in laughter. Maharishi cancelled the formal lectures for a time and told students to meditate for as long as possible. One student meditated for 42 straight hours, and Pattie Boyd once meditated for seven hours. Boyd's sister Jenny meditated for long periods as well, but also suffered from dysentery (misdiagnosed as tonsilitis); she said Lennon also felt unwell, suffering from jet lag and insomnia. The lengthy meditation sessions left many students moody and oversensitive. Like the 60 other students at the ashram, the Beatles adopted native dress and the ashram had a tailor on the premises to make clothes for the students. The Beatles shopped in Rishikesh and the women bought saris for themselves and to be made into shirts and jackets for the men, which affected Western fashion when the Beatles wore them after going home.|$|E
