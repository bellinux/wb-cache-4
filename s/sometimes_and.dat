5|$|The dogs of {{all these}} islands were short, and their sizes vary {{from that of a}} lap-dog to the largest spaniel. Their head is broad, the snout pointed, the eyes very small, the ears upright, and their hair rather long, lank, hard, and of {{different}} colours, but most commonly white and brown. They seldom if ever barked, but howled <b>sometimes,</b> <b>and</b> were shy of strangers to a degree of aversion.|$|E
5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the second verse, Madonna moves into her bedroom, wearing a very feminine lingerie looking outfit. She moves behind different white screens and dances in suggestive manner, her silhouette reflecting it {{from the other side of}} the screens. In the meantime the worker continues to think about Madonna's voice and dreams of her eyes amidst smokes. He then sees Madonna standing atop a long flight of stairs inside the factory, wearing a pinstripe suit and displaying a monocle glass. She dances on a platform, holding her crotch <b>sometimes,</b> <b>and</b> briefly tears open her jacket to exposes her bra, as two men pull at levers beside the steps. In the meantime, the owner of the factory listens to live musicians in his room, with a remote control, as Madonna is shown lying naked on her bed, with one end of a chain attached to her neck, the other end going long down into the factory. As the owner leers at the musicians in the room, the worker is shown caressing Madonna's cat, while looking up expectantly towards her room. Perhaps the owner in a suit is Madonna's husband and she is trying to escape him.|$|E

25|$|A constructivist {{approach}} {{states that}} the tradition was used on occasion, weakened or lapsed <b>sometimes,</b> <b>and</b> was sometimes revived to full effect after some unfortunate disputes - and that the custom started in time immemorial as Ethiopian common inheritance patterns allowed all agnates to also succeed to the lands of the monarchy - which however is contrary to keeping the country undivided.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sometimes,</b> <b>and</b> {{particularly}} later, {{words were}} taken from Latin, giving such sets as kingly (from Old English), royal (from Latin through French), regal (direct from Latin). Later French borrowings came from standard rather than Norman French; this leads to such cognate pairs as warden (from Norman), guardian (from later French; both of these words in fact derive from the same Germanic word).|$|E
25|$|Carvel {{construction}} {{dates back}} even earlier. The {{design of the}} luzzu is believed to date {{back at least to}} Phoenician times. A luzzu is a double-ended carvel-built fishing boat from the Maltese islands. Traditionally, they are brightly painted in shades of yellow, red, green and blue, and the bow is normally pointed with a pair of eyes. These eyes may be the modern survival of an ancient Phoenician custom (also practiced by the ancient Greeks); they are <b>sometimes</b> (<b>and</b> probably inaccurately) referred to as the Eye of Horus or of Osiris. The luzzu has survived because it tends to be a sturdy and stable boat even in bad weather. Originally, the luzzu was equipped with sails although nowadays almost all are motorised, with onboard diesel engines being the most common.|$|E

25|$|As such, the {{character}} of Montague seems to represent two separate historical personages in the play, and whilst this is not unusual in Shakespearean histories, {{the manner of the}} dual representation is. For example, in 1 Henry VI and 2 Henry VI, {{the character}} of Somerset represents both John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset and his younger brother, Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset. Similarly, in 3 Henry VI, another character called Somerset represents both Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset and his younger brother Edmund Beaufort, 4th Duke of Somerset. However, both Somerset in 1 Henry VI and 2 Henry VI and Somerset in 3 Henry VI are presented as consistent characters within the play, i.e. Somerset in 1 Henry VI and 2 Henry VI does not represent John Beaufort <b>sometimes</b> <b>and</b> Edmund Beaufort at others; he is consistently the same character in the milieu of the play. The same is true of Somerset in 3 Henry VI; as a character, he is always the same person.|$|E

The animation artists at the animation studio in South Korea, {{where much of the}} animation process takes place, had begun stenciling the eyes with a template, which according to Lynch resulted in [...] "strangely round eyes which look a little too big <b>sometimes</b> <b>and</b> much too perfect.

Harkening back to the early '90s, when Madonna, En Vogue, Whitney Houston and TLC were making very empowering music for women and the gay community and all kind of disenfranchised communities, the lyrics and the melodies were very poignant and very gospel and very spiritual and I said, 'That's the kind of record I need to make. That's the record that's going to shake up the industry.' It's not about the track. It's not about the production. It's about the song. Anyone could sing 'Born This Way'.

Mark Steven Johnson credits Joe Quesada with talking him out of using the traditional Bullseye costume for the film, and Farrell was encouraged to keep his Irish accent as this version of Bullseye is from Ireland. Farrell had to read Frank Miller's Daredevil comics to understand Bullseye [...] "because the expression on the character's faces in the comic books, and just the way they move <b>sometimes,</b> <b>and</b> the exaggerations of the character I'm playing [...] he's so over-the-top that you do draw from that.

[...] The couple, while living quietly, enjoyed entertaining, with Mrs. Jordan writing in late 1809: [...] "We shall have a full and merry house this Christmas, 'tis what the dear Duke delights in." [...] George III was accepting of his son's relationship with the actress (though recommending that he halve her allowance); in 1797, he created William Ranger of Bushy Park, which included a large residence, Bushy House, for William's growing family. William used Bushy as his principal residence until he became king. His London residence, Clarence House, was constructed to the designs of John Nash between 1825 and 1827.|$|E

500|$|After his {{retirement}} from an mechanical failure, Bräck stated it affected his championship chances slightly and {{his retirement}} {{from the race}} was [...] "something that you don't want to have happen but unfortunately it happens <b>sometimes</b> <b>and</b> today {{it was one of}} those days." [...] Three days after the race, Tracy and Takagi was penalized by CART chief stewart Chris Kneifel for [...] "unjustifiable risk" [...] and for causing several caution periods by contact with other competitors. Tracy had two championship points deducted and was placed on probation for the next three road or street course races, while Takagi also had two points taken off his total and was given a probation period of three events. Kneifel said why the penalties were issued: We did not want to simply issue probations without accompanying them with a strong signal that actions like this will not be tolerated. Championship points are very hard-earned, and they're more valuable than money. We want our response to send out the very strong message that this isn't a slap on the wrist, or a token punishment.|$|E
500|$|Farrell's {{supporting}} roles {{include an}} ambitious Justice Department agent opposite Tom Cruise, a potential criminal in Minority Report (2002), and the villain Bullseye in Daredevil (2003). Matt Damon was originally offered the Minority Report role, turning {{it down to}} appear in Ocean's Eleven. Farrell said [...] "he had no problem" [...] being the producer's fallback after Damon declined. Bullseye is an assassin, proud of his accuracy. Farrell was signed to the role in December 2001, although he was considered for the lead role of Matt Murdock (Daredevil) until Ben Affleck signed. Farrell was encouraged to keep his Irish accent, since this version of Bullseye is from Ireland. He read Frank Miller's Daredevil comics to understand Bullseye [...] "because the expression on the character's faces in the comic books, and {{just the way they}} move <b>sometimes,</b> <b>and</b> the exaggerations of the character I'm playing...he's so over-the-top that you do draw from that.

500|$|History {{remembers the}} Army of the Tennessee {{as one of}} the most {{important}} Union armies during the Civil War, an army intimately associated with the Union's two most celebrated generals, Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman. [...] It is thus rather ironic that frequent military reorganizations and looseness of usage during the war itself make it difficult to pinpoint the exact date at which this army formally came into existence. It should suffice to note that the [...] "nucleus [...] around which was to gather the... Army of the Tennessee" [...] first took shape in 1861–1862, while Grant was headquartered at Cairo, Illinois. Those troops continued under Grant in his next command, the distinct District of West Tennessee; they were then <b>sometimes,</b> <b>and</b> perhaps most appropriately, called the [...] "Army of West Tennessee." [...] However, army correspondence began using the term [...] "Army of the Tennessee" [...] in March 1862; that term soon became commonplace and naturally lived on when Grant's command was elevated to departmental status in October 1862, as the Department of the Tennessee. [...] During the course of the war, elements of the Army of the Tennessee performed many tasks, and the army evolved with the addition and subtraction of many units. It is not feasible to chronicle every such development here, even at the corps level. Rather, this article traces the main thrust of the army's development and its most memorable activities. At any given time, substantial numbers of troops were engaged in activities not discussed here. For example, in April 1863, less than half of Grant's departmental strength was directly engaged in the Vicksburg Campaign.|$|E
