40|$|What do <b>security</b> <b>barriers</b> do beyond blockading or demarcating territory? This article {{argues for}} an {{understanding}} of <b>security</b> <b>barriers</b> as sociotechnical devices. It argues for a rearticulation of <b>security</b> <b>barriers</b> as more than territorial technologies or the products and producers of sovereign power. It advances the discussion of <b>security</b> <b>barriers</b> beyond what {{can be thought of}} as a ‘geopolitics of security’, where the referent object is territory, and asks that we also consider how they work with mobility as productive devices to govern people in a variety of ways. The article empirically analyses the fences of Ceuta and Melilla, the barriers of Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians, and the US counterinsurgency fence in Falluja. Building on these illustrative cases, the article argues that <b>security</b> <b>barriers</b> should be understood as products of particular modes of government and producers of particular populations through their ability to perform interruptions and capture data...|$|R

According to media reports, the talks covered a number of issues, {{including}} the Israeli <b>security</b> <b>barrier</b> constructed following numerous Palestinian mass terror attacks. MacKay stated that it was justified due to security reasons, and could be removed if peace efforts succeeded.|$|E
25|$|The Israel−Gaza <b>security</b> <b>barrier</b> is {{a border}} barrier first {{constructed}} by Israel in 1994 between the Gaza Strip and Israel. The barrier {{runs along the}} entire land border of the Gaza Strip. Entry into the Gaza Strip by land is through five crossing points: the northern Erez Crossing into Israel, the southern Rafah Crossing into Egypt, the eastern Karni Crossing used only for cargo, and the other cargo crossing points, the Kerem Shalom Crossing {{on the border with}} Egypt and the Sufa Crossing farther north.|$|E

The tactic was devised to tamp down organized civilian protests in the West Bank. It has been used regularly against the villagers of Bil'in, Ni'lin, Kafr Qaddum, and Nabi Saleh, where weekly protests against the occupation are practiced.|$|E
25|$|Anticipating a press furore, it {{was decided}} to shoot the wedding in a church in private grounds where the press would not have access. However the press still turned up in large numbers, and {{security}} men had to be hired to keep cameramen away from the story action. Huge lorries were {{parked in front of the}} entrance to the church so that nothing could be seen, and the cast arrived in disguise. Finally strong lights were shone into the eyes of the journalists and photographers, making them extremely angry, and they constantly tried to gain access to the grounds by breaking the <b>security</b> <b>barrier</b> and telling the production team that they were really extras needed inside the church.|$|E

25|$|The General Services Administration {{immediately}} {{sought to}} replace the facility. The building site is a transition zone between the Central Business District and the North Downtown neighborhood. The new 185,000 square foot building was designed by Ross Barney Architects of Chicago, Illinois, with Carol Ross Barney as the lead designer. Constructed on a two city block site, one block north and west of the former site, the new building's design maximized sustainable design and workplace productivity initiatives. Security design was paramount to the Federal employees and its neighbors. Secure design was achieved based on the GSA's current standards for secure facilities including blast resistant glazing. Structural design resists progressive collapse. Building mass, glazing inside the courtyard, and bollards help to maintain a sense of openness and security. The art in architecture component of the building incorporates a water feature that acts as an additional <b>security</b> <b>barrier.</b>|$|E
500|$|A {{recessed}} trench wall {{known as}} a ha-ha has been built to minimize the visual impact of a <b>security</b> <b>barrier</b> surrounding the monument. After the September 11 attacks and another unrelated terror threat at the monument, authorities had put up a circle of temporary Jersey barriers to prevent large motor vehicles from approaching. The unsightly barrier {{was replaced by a}} less-obtrusive low [...] granite stone wall that doubles as a seating bench and also incorporates lighting. The installation received the 2005 Park/Landscape Award of Merit from the American Society of Landscape Architects.|$|E

In February 1965, Camp Holloway's outer perimeter was protected by a South Vietnamese security contingent which included one Ranger battalion, five Regional Force companies and one armored squadron. However, in their reconnaissance of Camp Holloway, the Viet Cong found the <b>security</b> <b>barrier</b> which surrounded the U.S. advisory compound was the real challenge, as it was protected by several layers of concertina wire fences which measured about [...] high.|$|E

500|$|Finkelstein is a sharp {{critic of}} the state of Israel. Discussing Finkelstein's book Beyond Chutzpah, Israeli {{historian}} Avi Shlaim stated that Finkelstein's critique of Israel [...] "is based on an amazing amount of research. He seems to have read everything. He has gone through the reports of Israeli groups, of human rights groups, Human Rights Watch and Peace Now and B'Tselem, all of the reports of Amnesty International. And he deploys all this evidence from Israeli and other sources in order to sustain his critique of Israeli practices, Israeli violations of human rights of the Palestinians, Israeli house demolitions, the targeted assassinations of Palestinian militants, the cutting down of trees, the building of the wall—the <b>security</b> <b>barrier</b> on the West Bank, which is illegal—the restrictions imposed on the Palestinians in the West Bank, {{and so on and so}} forth. I find his critique extremely detailed, well-documented and accurate." ...|$|E
500|$|Blair {{recorded}} {{a series of}} promotional interviews for radio and television for, among others, the Arabic television network Al Jazeera, the ITV1 daytime magazine programme This Morning, and BBC Two, which aired an hour-long interview with the journalist and political commentator Andrew Marr. He was in Washington, D.C. {{on the day of}} the UK launch to participate in peace talks with Middle East leaders and attend a White House dinner with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Israeli and Palestinian leaders. The British newspaper The Independent reported that Blair's visit to the United States was a coincidence, and not an attempt to be out of the United Kingdom when the book was published. When Blair arrived for his first book signing at a leading bookshop on O'Connell Street, Dublin on 4 September, demonstrators heckled, jeered and threw eggs and shoes at him. One activist posed as a purchaser to attempt a citizen's arrest of Blair for war crimes. Protestors clashed with Irish police and tried to push over a <b>security</b> <b>barrier</b> outside the shop. The demonstrators—anti-war protestors and Irish republicans opposed to the peace process—called queuing customers [...] "traitors" [...] and [...] "West Brits".
