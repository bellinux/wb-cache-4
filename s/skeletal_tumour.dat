30|$|The <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumour</b> burden was {{evaluated}} {{by using a}} volumetric public domain semi-automated software program, Metavol [12]. A large VOI over the whole-body volume was applied with a threshold of SUV of ≥ 15 outlining all bone lesions per patient to allow extraction of total 18 F-fluoride tumour volume (FTVSUV 15). The total <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumour</b> burden by 18 F-fluoride uptake activity, total lesion 18 F-Fluoride burden (TLF), was calculated by summing the product of SUVmean and FTVSUV 15 for all lesions. The whole-body determination of <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumour</b> burden with 18 F-fluoride PET/CT has been reported previously to be feasible and with high inter-reader reproducibility [13]. By correlating all uptakes on PET with CT morphology, we excluded all non-metastatic physiological and degenerative 18 F-fluoride uptake. Uptake in a spinal compression fracture was excluded in a single patient.|$|E

40|$|A benign chondroblastoma of bone is reported. It {{was unusual}} because it {{occurred}} {{in an old}} lady, in a toe, {{and it was not}} painful and radiologically resembled a chondroma.

An early classification in the Bone Tumour Registry of the American College of Surgeons, reviewed by Codman (1925) and Kolodny (1927), did not include any specifically cartilaginous group. Ewing (1928) was apparently the first to mention a chondroblastoma, which he considered “a calcifying variant of the giant-cell tumour of bone ” because of the scattered osteoclast-like cells.

40|$|It {{is quite}} common in Uganda for a patient to present with signs and {{symptoms}} of a malignant tumour of bone and it is important to distinguish primary from secondary neoplasms. In all such cases careful examination of likely primary sites is mandatory. If no primary site is apparent the distinction of a primary from a secondary neoplasm depends upon factors such as the relative frequency of various tumours, and the age, sex, anatomical site, radiological appearance, place and geographical location of the patient. In Western nations experience has accumulated which allows of a fairly accurate guess as to the nature of such <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumours.</b> In Uganda such background knowledge is often lacking because few clinicians see enough cases to build up experience of this problem. Because the relative frequency of primary tumours varies greatly around the world, it is likely that patterns of metastatic disease will also vary.

40|$|International audienceAim: CD 52 is a GPI-anchored {{glycoprotein}} that {{is expressed}} abundantly on all lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils {{and in the}} male genital tract. To date, the physiological role of CD 52 on lymphocytes has not been elucidated. However, an antibody directed to CD 52 called CAMPATH- 1 H {{has been shown to}} be capable of depleting lymphocytes. Tissue and cell lines of non-neoplastic bone, cartilage and <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumours</b> were analysed for CD 52 expression. Methods and results: We detected the expression of the CD 52 mRNA and protein both in vivo and in vitro. The malignant tumours showed a higher CD 52 expression compared to the benign tumours, suggesting a role in the development and progression of bone tumours. Interestingly, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry revealed that CD 52 was not only expressed on the surface of the tumour cells, but also in the cytoplasm. Our results obtained in osteosarcoma cells show that CAMPATH- 1 H leads to a complement-independent reduction of viable cells. Conclusion: CD 52 is expressed in a variety of bone tumours and the in vitro studies presented herein suggest that CAMPATH- 1 H treatment might have therapeutic potential for osteosarcoma patients with poor clinical prognosis...|$|R

30|$|One {{advantage}} of PET over conventional BS is that 18 F-fluoride SUV correlates well with kinetic parameters of bone formation [5]. This allows whole-body PET {{to be used}} for quantitative studies, which might be useful for defining prediction and determination of therapy response and prognosis using imaging at early time points. Baseline and follow-up imaging in clinical studies quantifying lesional uptake such as SUVmax, SUVmean and functional tumour volume (FTV); total <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumour</b> burden; total lesion 18 F-fluoride uptake (TLF) and biochemical bone turn over markers might correlate with outcome. In castrate resistant prostate cancer, <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumour</b> burden including biochemical bone parameters is suggested to be strong prognostic indicators of overall survival [6]. Thus, 18 F-fluoride can be a potential biomarker for monitoring treatment response and outcome.|$|E
30|$|Life {{expectancy}} is a {{major factor}} to be considered in the management of prostate cancer patients. Risk stratification schemes based on clinical T stage, Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) are widely used to estimate risk in individual patients.

Bone scintigraphy, however, is commonly used to assess <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumour</b> burden in prostate cancer patients, both in clinical routine and in nearly every clinical trial. In order to extract as much clinical information as possible from the bone scans, the Bone Scan Index (BSI) was developed as a quantitative tool to improve the interpretability and clinical relevance of the bone scan [3].

40|$|RADIOACTIVE {{strontium}} {{is produced}} in considerable quantity {{as a result of}} nuclear fission. It presents one of the potential hazards of the modern world since when ingested it is retained in the skeleton, and having a half-life of 28 years it continues to irradiate both bone and bone marrow. It is known to cause both <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumours</b> and profound anaemia in experimental animals and presumably can do so in man (Lisco, Finkel and Brues, 1947; Brues, 1949; Finkel, Lisco and Brues, 1955). The hazard may occur in two ways: (i) By the ingestion of one or more large doses of strontium {{as a result of an}} industrial or laboratory accident; (ii) by the continuous ingestion of minute amounts of strontium due to radioactive "fall out "from atomic explosions contaminating soil and herbage. The present report describes experiments which are applicable to the first type of hazard. Large single doses of 90 Sr were given to rabbits of three age groups, with the result that the effects of radiation were observed after a relatively short time in some animals, the majority dying within 6 - 8 months.

40|$|PURPOSE: 18 F-fluoride PET/CT {{exhibits}} high {{sensitivity to}} delineate {{and measure the}} extent of bone metastatic disease in patients with prostate cancer. 18 F-fluoride PET/CT could potentially replace traditional bone scintigraphy in clinical routine and trials. However, more {{studies are needed to}} assess repeatability and biological uptake variation. The aim {{of this study was to}} perform test-retest analysis of quantitative PET-derived parameters and blood/serum bone turnover markers at the same time point. Ten patients with prostate cancer and verified bone metastases were prospectively included. All underwent two serial 18 F-fluoride PET/CT at 1  h post-injection. Up to five dominant index lesions and whole-body 18 F-fluoride <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumour</b> burden were recorded per patient. Lesion-based PET parameters were SUVmax, SUVmean and functional tumour volume applying a VOI with 50 % threshold (FTV 50 %). The total <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumour</b> burden, total lesion 18 F-fluoride (TLF), was calculated using a threshold of SUV of ≥ 15. Blood/serum biochemical bone turnover markers obtained at the time of each PET were PSA, ALP, S-osteocalcin, S-beta-CTx, 1 CTP and BAP. RESULTS: A total of 47 index lesions and a range of 2 - 122 bone metastases per patient were evaluated. Median time between 18 F-fluoride PET/CT was 7  days (range 6 - 8  days).

RESULTS: At a dose of 40 mg kg 1, AT effectively attenuated both weight loss and growth of the MAC 16 tumour, and both effects were attenuated by co-administration of Zn 2 þ. The concentration of zinc in gastrocnemius muscle increased with increasing weight loss, whereas administration of AT decreased the levels of zinc in plasma, <b>skeletal</b> muscle and <b>tumour,</b> which were restored back to control values after administration of ZnSO 4.

In a different set of experiments, mice bearing a cachexia-inducing tumour (the Lewis lung carcinoma) showed an increase in muscle DNA fragmentation (9. 8 -fold) as compared with their non-tumour-bearing control counterparts as previously described. When gene-deficient mice for tumour necrosis factor-α receptor protein I were inoculated with Lewis lung carcinoma, they were also affected by DNA fragmentation; however the increase was only 2. 1 -fold.

30|$|Oncologists or urologists {{in charge}} of {{managing}} patients with prostate cancer have several choices for evaluating the treatment response in metastatic disease to the bone. CT, whole-body MRI and BS are the classical and widely available imaging modalities. Morphological assessments with CT and MRI using RECIST protocols are time-consuming. Planar BS is associated with lower sensitivity and specificity than 18 F-fluoride PET/CT, but automated software for tumour burden definition is available. 18 F-fluoride PET/CT has a very high sensitivity for detection of early bone metastasis in many cancers and, as shown in this study, is highly reproducible under controlled conditions. Similar to BS, the radioactive signal from 18 F-fluoride is largely irrelevant for evaluating soft tissue metastases, but PET can be combined with simultaneous contrast-enhanced CT to overcome this limitation. Definition of the total <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumour</b> burden using 18 F-fluoride is experimental, but the softwares {{used in this study}} are available either commercially or in the public domain. In this study, measurements of uptake and volumes from five larger index lesions had higher repeatability than total <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumour</b> burden and are potentially sufficient in clinical trials. The inclusion of small lesions in TLF reduced accuracy, which is largely associated with the resolution of both the scanner and the reconstructed image matrix. Although promising from the point of accuracy, more prospective trials are needed to validate 18 F-fluoride PET/CT as a surrogate biomarker of outcome before routine application. Direct imaging of the tumour metabolic activity using 18 F-FDG PET/CT is widely applicable but has a relatively low sensitivity in PCa. Malignant lipogenesis is a hallmark of aggressively growing cancer both in soft tissue and bone metastases and can be imaged using 11 C-acetate [20, 21] or 11 C/ 18 F-choline PET/CT [22, 23], but these tracers are less widely available and there are few studies on accuracy and other aspects of biomarker qualification so far. Both 18 F-fluoride and 18 F-choline have been shown to detect more skeletal lesions than 99 mTc-diphosphonate bone scanning [24, 25]. 18 F-fluoride is also more specific than BS [26].|$|E
40|$|The NFκB {{signaling}} pathway is implicated in breast cancer and bone metastasis. However, the bone-autonomous contribution of NFκB to breast cancer-induced osteolysis is poorly understood. Here, we report that pretreatment of osteoblasts with the sesquiterpene lactone Parthenolide (PTN), a verified NFκB inhibitor, prior to exposure to conditioned medium from human and mouse breast cancer cell lines enhanced osteoblast differentiation and reduced osteoblast ability to stimulate osteoclastogenesis. PTN prevented breast cancer-induced osteoclast formation and reduced the ability of breast cancer cells to prolong osteoclast survival and to inhibit osteoclast apoptosis. In vivo, administration of PTN in immuno-competent mice reduced osteolytic bone loss and <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumour</b> growth following injection of the syngeneic 4 T 1 -BT 1 cells and reduced local osteolysis caused by conditioned medium from human and mouse osteotropic breast cancer cell lines. Mechanistic studies revealed that NFκB inhibition by PTN in osteoblasts and osteoclasts {{was accompanied by a}} significant increase in β-catenin activation and expression. Collectively, these results raise the possibility that combined targeting of NFκB and β-catenin signalling in the tumour microenvironment may be of value in the treatment of breast cancer related osteolysis...|$|E
40|$|Background: Despite {{advances}} {{in the treatment of}} primary limb osteosarcoma, the outcome of patients with primary metastatic and axial skeletal disease remains poor. The European Osteosarcoma Intergroup have assessed a combination chemotherapy regimen consisting of ifosfamide (IFOS) 3 g/m(2) /d 1 - 2, doxorubicin (DOX) 25 mg/m(2) /d 1 - 3 i. v. bolus and cisplatin (CDDP) 100 mg/m(2) /d 1. Patients and methods: One hundred nine previously untreated patients with primary osteosarcoma were registered. Eligibility was confirmed in 103. At presentation, 45 eligible patients had metastatic disease, 15 axial <b>skeletal</b> primary <b>tumours</b> and 43 non-metastatic limb tumours. Results: The major toxicities were myelosuppression (90 %, grade 3 or 4) and nausea and vomiting (74 %, grade 3 or 4). Overall mean relative dose intensity (RDI) was 80 % (88 % CDDP, 75 % IFOS, 81 % DOX). Clinical response as measured by reduction in tumour volume occurred in 36 % (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) : 27 %- 47 %) of primary tumours. Response of pulmonary metastases to chemotherapy was seen in 33 % (95 % CI: 19 %- 49 %). Good histological response (greater than or equal to 90 % necrosis of the tumour) occurred in 33 % (95 % CI: 22 %- 45 %) of resected tumours. Five-year survival was 62 % in limb-non-metastatic, 41 % in axial skeletal and 16 % in limb metastatic patients.

These tumours occur in children where they may result in severe debilitating disease. This study was therefore aimed at determining the age, gender and site distribution of soft tissue tumours in the young. Materials and Methods: The records of all pathology consultations during the 20 year period from (1990 - 2010), from the Department of Morbid Anatomy/Histopathology, University of Benin Teaching Hospital from birth to 20 years, were utilized for this study. The lesions were standardized in accordance with the world health organization (WHO) classification. Permission for this study was obtained from the UBTH ethics committee (protocol number ADM/E 22 /A/VOL. VII/ 142). Results: A total of 139 lesions were recorded, 72 males and 67 females with a male/female ratio of 1. 1 : 1. Benign tumours constituted 113 (81 %) while malignant tumours accounted for 26 (19 %). This study demonstrated that, nerve sheath tumours and vascular tumours accounted for 25 % of STT in children followed by adipocytic <b>tumours</b> 22 %, <b>skeletal</b> muscle <b>tumours</b> 17 %, fibrohistiocytic tumours 7 %, fibroblastic tumours 5 %, and perivascular tumours 1 % respectively.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The small stress {{heat shock}} protein 27 (Hsp 27) has {{recently}} turned as a promising target for cancer treatment. Hsp 27 upregulation is associated with tumour growth and resistance to chemo- and radio-therapeutic treatments, and several ongoing drugs inhibiting Hsp 27 expression are under clinical trial. Hsp 27 is now well described to counteract apoptosis and its elevated expression is associated with increased aggressiveness of several primary tumours. However, {{its role in the}} later stage of tumour progression and, more specifically, in the later and most deadly stage of tumour metastasis is still unclear. METHODS/RESULTS: In the present study, we showed by qRT-PCR that Hsp 27 gene is overexpressed in a large fraction of the metastatic breast cancer area in 53 patients. We further analysed the role of this protein in mice during bone metastasis invasion and establishment by using Hsp 27 genetically depleted MDA-MB 231 /B 02 human breast cancer cell line as a model. We demonstrate that Hsp 27 silencing led to reduced cell migration and invasion in vitro and that in vivo it correlated with a decreased ability of breast cancer cells to metastasise and grow in the skeleton.

40|$|Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a <b>skeletal</b> muscle-derived <b>tumour</b> and is {{the most}} common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood. RMS tumours arise due to defects in differentiation, and as a result proliferate indefinitely. Pannexins consist of three members (pannexin 1, 2, and 3) and are known to form single {{membrane}} channels. Reports have shown expression of pannexin 3 (Panx 3) as both the expected molecular weight species at ~ 43 kDa as well as a ~ 70 kDa immunoreactive species. While studies have begun to report on the function of the ~ 43 kDa form, the exact identity and function of the ~ 70 kDa immunoreactive species of Panx 3 remains poorly understood. It has recently been reported that the ~ 70 kDa immunoreactive species of Panx 3 is highly expressed in proliferative, non-differentiated human primary skeletal muscle myoblasts (HSMM), becoming drastically down regulated during differentiation. Indeed, knockdown of the ~ 70 kDa immunoreactive species of Panx 3 inhibited proliferation without inducing differentiation in skeletal muscle myoblasts. We thus hypothesized that the ~ 70 kDa immunoreactive species of Panx 3 would be upregulated in RMS supporting this proliferative phenotype. Here we now show that the ~ 70 kDa immunoreactive species of Panx 3 is increased in RMS cell lines and tumours to a level similar to that seen in undifferentiated HSMM and fetal tissues, respectively. Further characterization of this species revealed that it is indeed a glycoprotein, an intrinsic characteristic of all pannexin members, it is recognized by two Panx 3 antibodies targeting distinct epitopes, and it is reduced with Panx 3 specific shRNA. Reduction of levels of the ~ 70 kDa immunoreactive species of Panx 3 resulted in a significant decrease in proliferation of RMS cells without inducing differentiation. Taken together, these data suggest that the ~ 70 kDa immunoreactive species of Panx 3 might be involved in keeping undifferentiated RMS cells in a proliferative state and that reduction of its levels or functions may be beneficial for RMS...|$|R
40|$|To {{test the}} {{potential}} of immunoreactive BSP, a non-collagenous bone matrix component, as a clinical guide in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias, serum BSP concentrations were measured in 62 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) followed {{over a period of}} 4 years, in 46 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), in 71 patients with untreated benign vertebral osteoporosis (OPO), and in 139 healthy adults. Results were compared with clinical and laboratory data, including serum osteocalcin (OC), and urinary pyridinoline (PYD) and deoxypyridinoline (DPD) as markers of bone turnover. In MM, serum BSP, and urinary PYD and DPD were higher than in healthy controls and in MGUS or OPO (P< 0. 001). BSP levels correlated with the bone marrow plasma cell content (r = 0. 40, P< 0. 001), and serum β 2 -microglobulin (r = 0. 31, P < 0. 01). The differentiation of MM from healthy controls and from MGUS or OPO was highest for BSP. After chemotherapy, BSP reflected the response to treatment and correlated with the change in monoclonal protein (r = 0. 55, P< 0. 001). MM patients with normal baseline BSP levels survived longer than patients with initially elevated BSP values (P< 0. 001, logrank test). Only serum monoclonal protein and BSP were independent predictors of survival. We conclude that in MM, BSP levels are associated with <b>skeletal</b> involvement and <b>tumour</b> cell burden. The quantification of serum BSP may be a non-invasive method for the diagnosis and follow-up, and may improve the prognostic value of conventional staging in MM. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign [URL]...|$|R
40|$|This work {{examines}} {{skeletal muscle}} catabolism in cancer and its attenuation by Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA). In vivo studies in mice bearing a cachexia inducing murine colon adenocarcinoma - MAC 16, demonstrated an elevation in the gastrocnemius muscle {{in the activity}} and expression of regulatory components of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway. This was accompanied by an accelerated loss of muscle tissue correlating {{with an increase in}} overall weight loss, all of which were attenuated by prior daily dosing with EPA. Recently a proteolysis inducing factor (PIF) has been isolated from the MAC 16 tumour, and from the serum and urine of cachectic cancer patients. Previous studies have shown that PIF induces protein degradation in vitro, and that this is possibly mediated through 15 -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15 -HETE), a metabolite of the n- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acid- arachidonate. Employing the murine myoblast cell line C 2 C 12, it was shown that both PIF and 15 -HETE increased protein degradation and expression of proteasome subunits, processes which were again attenuated by prior incubation in EPA. Similarly, in NMRI mice which had been fasted for 24 hours, EPA and the lipoxygenase inhibitor CV- 6504 (but not structurally related fatty acids) inhibited skeletal muscle proteolysis and expression of various proteasome subunits, showing that firstly, EPA may be anti-cachexic partly through its ability to influence 15 -HETE production; and secondly that the effect is specific for EPA as other fatty acids had no effect. Previous studies have suggested the involvement of the signal transduction family NFKB in response to PIF in the liver. It has been demonstrated here that both PIF and 15 -HETE increased nuclear translocation of NFKB in the <b>skeletal</b> muscle of <b>tumour</b> bearing mice and that EPA inhibited this process by its ability to prevent the degradation of the NFKB inhibitor protein IKB. When an NFKB inhibitor was added to C 2 C 12 myotubes, prior to the addition of PIF, proteasome activity and protein degradation was inhibited, showing that NFKB is responsible for the increased proteasome activity and muscle catabolism induced by PIF. Taken together this work suggests that 15 -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid is the intracellular mediator for PIF induced protein degradation in skeletal muscle and that elevated muscle catabolism is accomplished through an increased functioning of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a process possibly mediated through an NFKB dependent mechanism. The anticachectic (and possibly the anti-tumourigenic) effects of EPA appear to be achieved in part by its ability to inhibit the degradation of IKB and possibly by its ability to interfere with 15 -HETE production...|$|R
30|$|This study {{investigated}} the repeatability of quantitative 18 F-fluoride PET/CT measurements and simultaneously acquired blood-based tumour and bone remodelling markers. Repeatability of five selected index lesions in 18 F-fluoride PET/CT was high {{and appears to be}} a stable and trustworthy technique that potentially can replace the traditional BS. For evaluating and monitoring therapy effect, a change in SUVmax, SUVmean and FTV 50 % between the range of 23 % up to 26 % can occur as a normal variation, suggesting that changes of ≥ 25 % increase or decrease during treatment can be interpreted as a significant change in 18 F-fluoride uptake for a single lesion. Similar magnitudes in test-retest variation were observed for PSA and the bone specific remodelling markers in blood/serum. For evaluating and monitoring therapy effects of the total <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumour</b> burden, TLF, changes less than 35 % cannot be distinguished from normal test-retest variability. This higher variation in uptake was probably due to inclusion of many small lesions (non-index) that were more prone to variation in uptake SUV and volume than larger lesions in a test-retest setting between PET 1 and PET 2. The repeatability coefficient used as the statistical estimate of test-retest precision in this study can be considered a conservative measure but is in line with results from studies of FDG-PET [16]. Other frequently used statistics, such as intra-class correlation or mean standard error of measurement, typically indicate much lower variation.|$|E
30|$|Rohren et al {{showed that}} {{determination}} of <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumour</b> burden with 18 F-fluoride PET/CT is feasible and highly reproducible regarding inter-observer reproducibility [13]. Using a SUVmax threshold of 10, {{they were able}} to exclude nearly all non-cancerous bone activity from volumetric calculations. In the current study, a threshold of SUVmax ≥ 15 was found to perform better for excluding tracer uptake in degenerative changes. The reason for this could be related both to technical and biological issues. 18 F-fluoride uptake in bone is irreversible at least for the first few hours after injection and increases with time. Soft tissues function as a reservoir of un-bound tracer from which tracer will recirculate for further uptake in bone or urinary excretion. Excretion is solely through urine. Hence, the actual values derived from regional uptake measurements will vary with the time from tracer injection to scanning, emission acquisition time per bed position and renal clearance. To reduce the impact of these known confounders, patients were instructed to drink water ad libitum prior to and after tracer injection and scanning was performed as close to the 1 -h time point as possible in a clinical environment. Sampling for biochemical markers was standardised by obtaining blood at a fixed hour after an over-night fast. By coincidence, PET was therefore also performed in the fasting state, but {{there is no evidence that}} fasting affects uptake of 18 F-fluoride and is not currently recommended [11].|$|E

40|$|Of all of {{the cancer}} {{patients}} throughout the world, approximately 50 % of them are affected to some degree by cachexia. This syndrome involves significant skeletal muscle wasting, loss of adipose tissue and overall decrease in body weight in patients, particularly those with lung, pancreatic and gastric cancers. Cancer-induced cachexia {{is characterized by the}} presence of increased cytokines, notably TNF-α, IL- 1 β and IL- 6. Most patients suffering of cancer-induced cachexia experience increased toxicity in response to chemotherapy, leading to fewer rounds of treatment and thus impeding the patients’ chances for recovery. More research into effective treatments for cancer-induced cachexia would therefore be indispensable. The inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) have emerged as important cancer targets, primarily because of their roles as caspase inhibitors and regulators of NF-κB signalling. Small molecule IAP antagonists known as Smac mimetic compounds (SMCs) are currently in stage I/II clinical trials. They function by targeting cIAP 1 and cIAP 2 (and to a lesser extent, XIAP) resulting in a cytokine mediated death response in cancer cells. SMCs induce the production of TNF-α, a cytokine with which SMCs can potently synergize. However, limited efficacy occurs in some cancer cell lines (presumably because TNF-α cannot be induced in an autocrine fashion) and an exogenous source of the cytokine, such as that induced by using an oncolytic virus, is required. Notably, TNF-α (initially known as “cachectin”) is known to {{play a significant role in}} the induction of skeletal muscle atrophy. We therefore wanted to examine the effects of TNF-α induction by SMC and oncolytic virus co-treatment on both <b>tumour</b> regression and <b>skeletal</b> muscle in <b>tumour</b> bearing mice. We investigated the effects of SMC treatment on Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) and B 16 F 10 melanoma cell lines, both of which have been shown to be established cachectic cancer cell lines. Our in-vitro analysis of LLC and B 16 F 10 cells revealed that LLC cells are sensitive to SMC and TNF-α co-treatment whereas B 16 F 10 cancer cells remain resistant. SMC treatment, in combination with an oncolytic virus, VSVΔ 51, increased tumour regression and survival time in LLC tumour bearing mice. Based on findings from previous studies, we investigated the role of cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) in the resistance of the B 16 F 10 melanoma cell line to SMC treatment. We were able to determine that the down-regulation of c-FLIP sensitizes the B 16 F 10 cells to SMC and TNF-α induced cell death. In extending these findings, we found that SMC treatment alone can cause skeletal muscle wasting in the tibialis anterior muscle of LLC tumour bearing mice. However, the atrophic response was observed to be minimal as documented by a slight but significant decrease (approximately 10 %) in muscle fibre cross-sectional area. Moreover, no biochemical evidence of muscle atrophy, as visualized by changes in the expression of myosin heavy chain (MHC) and Muscle RING Finger protein 1 (MuRF 1), was found. Regardless, we speculate that the impact of SMC treatment on muscle wasting would be transient and reversible, and propose that the benefits of such a combination immunotherapy would greatly outweigh the risks...|$|R

40|$|Some {{relations}} between metastatic bone disease and calcium homoeostasis were determined in a consecutive series of 81 patients with solid malignant tumours attending for radionuclide bone scans. Biochemical evaluation showed that bone resorption from metastatic disease {{was generally not}} enough to account for hypercalcaemia. While skeletal metastases were present in {{about half of the}} patients who developed hypercalcaemia, biochemical indices of bone resorption in these subjects were greatly increased and disproportionate to the extent of metastatic disease detected by the bone scans. Furthermore, a reduced renal phosphate threshold and increased tubular calcium reabsorption were generally observed in hypercalcaemic patients when compared with their normocalcaemic counterparts. These findings suggest that in most cases malignancy associated hypercalcaemia may be caused by the release of a humoral factor by tumour tissue which exhibits "parathyroid-hormone-like" activity with regard to bone resorption, renal phosphate threshold, and renal calcium handling. It may be postulated that this putative humoral mediator predisposes to hypercalcaemia both by stimulating generalised osteolysis and in most cases also by impairing the renal excretion of the resultant increase in filtered calcium load. While hypercalcaemia may arise as a result of metastatic bone disease alone, these data indicate that this may be {{the exception rather than the}} rule. Hence the term "metastatic hypercalcaemia" should probably be reserved for patients with extensive <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumour</b> disease in whom biochemical evaluation fails to yield evidence of an underlying humorally mediated cause...|$|E
