In the present paper, we claim a research using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to handle downhole dynamometer card auto recognition problems in a suck rod pumping system. First of all, we introduce a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> reasonable <b>dynamometer</b> card features which can reflect the characters of the cards. Then, an ELM associated with the features is constructed to recognize faults of the system automatically.

40|$|Minimum Quantity Lubrication (MQL) is an {{alternative}} method to supply the cutting fluid {{in the formation of}} mist. MQL has proven to reduce machining cost and increase machining performance. Previous research have stated that machining performance is affected by the lubricant type, flow rate, the distance between nozzle and tool tip, and the workpiece material. These important parameters are not reported in many research documents. MQL is known for its many benefits but no one was able to prove that the statement is true or ever suggested a systematic procedure to prove MQL’s efficiency. The effectiveness and the working principle of MQL are still questionable with very few explanations provided. The present study is about investigation of cutting temperature and cutting force from mist flow pattern in MQL technique The MQL nozzle distance and cutting fluid flow pattern are among the factors that can provide optimum machining performance in term of cutting force and cutting temperature. The objective {{of this study is to}} conduct machining process using MQL technique with different combination of spray parameters and to optimize spray parameters for minimum machining temperature and cutting forces. The four nozzle distances of 3, 6, 7 and 9 mm were selected based on the results obtained from Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA). The machining performance was evaluated under three levels of cutting speed and two levels of feed rate at constant depth of cut. The cutting force was measured using a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>dynamometer</b> and cutting temperature using thermal imager. The most suitable mist flow pattern during machining was the largest spray cone angle supplied under 0. 4 MPa input air pressure. The results obtained from the machining process shows a significant reduction of cutting force and cutting temperature at the nozzle distance in the range of 6 to 9 mm under 0. 4 MPa input air pressure for larger diameter OD 30 nozzle...|$|R

The subjects performed maximal grip strength tests using the Jamar dynamometer and the BTE-Primus. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated for test-retest reliability and criterion-related validity. A repeated measures analysis of covariance was conducted to reveal differences in grip strength between instruments, body positions, hands, and sessions. The BTE-Primus grip tool was found to be reliable (r = 0. 97 to 0. 98) and valid (r = 0. 95 to 0. 96). There were no significant differences in grip strength scores between the Jamar and the BTE-Primus or between sitting and standing. Grip strength scores of the right hand were significantly greater than those of the left hand, and grip strength scores in the first session were significantly greater than those in the second session. The results of this study indicate that clinicians can use the BTE-Primus grip attachment at the second handle setting and know that is reliable, valid, and comparable to the second-handle <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> the Jamar <b>dynamometer...</b>|$|R

40|$|In modern manufacturing, cutting forces {{measurement}} is a {{key element}} in understanding the operational conditions during machining. Nevertheless, in some cases, the use <b>of</b> <b>dynamometers</b> can be problematic, for instance in case of thin-walled workpieces in presence of instabilities: due to the presence of resonances in the frequency response <b>of</b> the <b>dynamometer</b> itself can induce significant perturbations in the measured signals.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} a {{comprehensive}} technique to obtain accurate three-dimensional (3 D) micromachining forces for frequency bandwidths up to 25 kHz. The capability to precisely measure cutting forces is central to gaining fundamental understanding on micromachining mechanics and dynamics. Multi-axis dynamometers are used to measure 3 D machining forces. Forces experienced during micromachining involve very high frequencies due to the ultra-high spindle speeds used during the process. However, the specified bandwidths <b>of</b> the <b>dynamometers</b> do not meet high frequency requirements of micromachining forces; this limitation stems from the structural-dynamics response <b>of</b> the <b>dynamometers.</b> Therefore, {{it is important to}} develop approaches to compensate for the distortions arising from the dynamic effects <b>of</b> the <b>dynamometer's</b> structure in order to accurately measure micromachining forces. This paper presents a fully 3 D compensation approach to enable accurate determination of 3 D micromachining forces within a wide frequency range. The presented approach involves: (1) accurate identification of 3 D force measurement characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>dynamometer</b> in the form of 3 x 3 force-to-force frequency response functions (F 2 F-FRFs) matrix within a 25 kHz bandwidth, (2) design of an optimal inverse filter for post-processing the measured force data to remove the influence of structural dynamics of the dynamometer; and (3) validation of the compensation approach through impact testing where the actual applied force data acquired by the reference force sensor is compared with the corrected dynamometer measurements. Subsequently, the presented approach is demonstrated by obtaining 3 D micromachining forces during micromilling of a brass workpiece. It is concluded that the presented approach is effective in high-frequency correction <b>of</b> <b>dynamometer</b> measurements for accurate measurement of 3 D micromachining forces within the 0 - 25 kHz frequency range...|$|R

Design Muscle strength in four directions (glenohumeral abduction, external rotation and elevation and elbow flexion) was measured using both instruments by two examiners. The assessments were repeated {{by one of the}} examiners 3 days later. Setting Leiden University Medical Center. Participants Twenty healthy volunteers. Main outcome measures Time to complete a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> measurements and discomfort were recorded. To determine intra- and inter-observer reliability, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs), limits of agreement and smallest detectable difference were computed. Results The time to complete a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> measurements was significantly shorter for the hand-held dynamometer than for the fixed dynamometer in both examiners. The number of subjects reporting discomfort was similar with the two dynamometers. Except for glenohumeral abduction, the forces measured using the hand-held dynamometer were significantly higher than those when using the fixed dynamometer in both examiners. The intra- and inter-observer ICCs for the four directions ranged from 0. 82 to 0. 98 for both dynamometers. However, the mean differences between replications and the wide limits of agreement suggest substantial bias and variability. For example, for the measurement of shoulder abduction with the fixed dynamometer by one tester (190 N), the results suggest that on 95 % of occasions the second tester's measurement would be between 158 and 275 N. Conclusions Although time taken and discomfort should be considered in the selection <b>of</b> <b>dynamometers,</b> due consideration should be given to the significant differences in absolute results. Neither the dynamometers nor the testers can be considered interchangeable. Both the intra- and inter-observer reliability <b>of</b> the two <b>dynamometers</b> were similar, yet both demonstrated systematic bias and variability in the measurements obtained.
