Its function is to cleave off an extra, or precursor tRNA, sequence on the 5' end of one stranded RNA. RNase P is one of two known multiple turnover ribozymes in nature (the other being the ribosome). For example, in bacteria RNase P is also responsible for the catalytic activity of holoenzymes, which consist of an apoenzyme that forms an active enzyme system by combination with a coenzyme and determines the <b>specifity</b> of this system for a substrate. A form of RNase P that is a protein and does not contain RNA has recently been discovered.|$|E

The results of several diagnostic methods which are supplemental for convenient colonoscopy, are described. Thus, NBI system (narrow spectrum endoscopy) and FICE combined with system for magnifying endoscopy significantly improve sensitivity and <b>specifity</b> of diagnostic method. However, the serious disadvantage is coloration of intestinal contents into different shades of red, impeding visualization of small structures and lesions. For detection of dysplasia of different degree {{in patients with}} colon polyps high levels of sensitivity and <b>specifity</b> were shown in the methods of magnifying and zoom-endoscopy (93. 8 % and 64. 6 %, respectively), confocal laser endomicroscopy (81 % and 82 %, perspectively), and optic coherent tomography (92 % and 84 %, respectively).

40|$|Introduction & Objective: β- {{hemolytic}} group A streptococcus is {{the most}} common cause of acute bacterial pharyngitis in children. Due to the high incidence of this disease and it's difficult diagnosis, we decided to compare clinical scoring and throat cultures for diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. Materials & Methods: This cross-sectional analytic study was done on 3 - 16 year old patients reffered to pediatric clinic with complaint of sore throat. After taking history and physical examination, scoring was done based on clinical findings. The patients with chronic disease or those who received antibiotics or other drugs were eliminated from the study. Analysis was performed using SPSS. Score for each patient was calculated and compared with the result of throat cultures. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for each clinical finding were determined. Results: 315 patients out of 350 patients with complaint of sore throat referred to the clinic had fever of whom 51. 1 % had positive throat culture with 51. 1 % sensitivity and 77 % <b>specifity</b> (p< 0. 01). 127 patients had pharyngeal petechia of whom 67 % had positive throat culture with 66. 9 % sensitivity and 73. 5 % <b>specifity</b> (p< 0. 002). 105 children had pharyngeal exudates of whom 65. 7 % had positive throat culture with 65. 7 % sensitivity and 58. 3 % <b>specifity</b> (p< 0. 001). Anterior cervical lymphadenopathy was detected in 293 patients of whom 53. 24 % had positive throat culture with 53. 2 % sensitivity and 73. 8 % <b>specifity</b> (p< 0. 002). 182 patients had no signs of upper respiratory infection, among them 65. 9 % had positive throat culture with 65. 9 % sensitivity and 70. 4 % <b>specifity</b> (p< 0. 001). 130 patients had sore throat, 66. 3 % of them had positive throat culture with 62. 3 % sensitivity and 59 % <b>specifity</b> (p< 0. 001). 310 patients had pharyngeal erythema of which 51. 6 % had positive throat culture with 57. 5 % sensitivity and 22. 7 % <b>specifity</b> (p< 0. 02). 99 children had gastrointestinal signs, 66. 14 % had positive throat culture with sensitivity 64. 6 % and <b>specifity</b> was 58. 8 % (p< 0. 005). Headache occurred in 116 patients of whom 75. 86 % had positive throat culture with 75. 9 % sensitivity and 64. 9 % <b>specifity</b> (p< 0. 001). From 350 patients, in 155 children scores were equal or more than 7 of whom 83. 25 % had positive culture. Equal scores of 5 - 6 were detected in 111 patients of whom 28 % had positive culture. In 84 patients scores were equal or less than 4 among them only 7 % had positive culture. Conclusion: Findings of this study showed that with increase in clinical score, the probability of positive throat culture increases. We recommend this clinical scoring system for diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis especially in areas where throat culture and rapid antigen detection test are not available so it can be useful for better diagnosis and reduces inappropriate antibiotic prescription.

40|$|The {{hard tick}} Ixodes ricinus is an {{important}} blood-feeding parasite that transmits tick- borne diseases, such as tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme disease. Ticks employ a battery of proteolytic enzymes, including cathepsins, to digest their bloodmeal. These proteins are potential targets {{for the development of}} anti-tick vaccines. This work is focused on cathepsin L from I. ricinus (IrCL), namely its isoenzymes IrCL 1 and IrCL 3. IrCL 1 was expressed in Pichia pastoris and chromatographically purified. Its substrate <b>specifity</b> was determined by the cleavage of (a) peptide fluorogenic substrates and (b) protein substrates analyzed by mass spectrometry. The proteolytic activity of IrCL 1 was modulated by its interaction with glycosaminoglycans, which affected the pH optimum value.

40|$|Introduction and objective: Hydatidosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and commonly found parasitic zoonoses in both humans and different animals, which is caused by the cestode helminthes Echinococcus granulosus. The diagnosis of the disease is primarily based on imagery techniques. Thus, highly sensitive and reliable serologic methods are required to confirm the diagnosis. AntigenB (AgB) and protoscoleces antigen (PSC Ag) were purified as two specific parasitic antigens and then evaluated against sera from two groups of hydatidosis and non-hydatidosis (control) subjects using the western blotting method in order to identify the most sensitive and specific antigen. Materials and methods: Sera samples were taken from 22 patients under operation for hydatid cyst. 16 patients were also included as control group. Cyst fluid and protoscoleces were extracted and partially purified in a protein A column. Using SDS-PAGE, subunits of the cyst fluid antigen, AgB, and PSC Ag were identified. Finally, the subunits were transferred from gel to nitrocellulose membrane in a western blot test and reacted with hydatid and control sera in order to assess their sensitivity and <b>specifity.</b> Results: Three antigens were identified as the subunits of AgB while 10 antigens were identified as PSC Ag. The sensitivity and <b>specifity</b> of AgB subunits in the western blot test were 77 % and 100 %, respectively. None of the PSC Ag subunits had both high sensitivity and high <b>specifity</b> concurrently. Conclusion: It has been shown by the western blot test that the AgB 8 / 12 and 16 KDa subunit components had high diagnostic sensitivity and <b>specifity</b> levels (81 % and 100 %, respectively) and that they could presumably assist the physician in his pre- and post-operation diagnosis of hydatid cysts...|$|E
