Microelements concentration in alfalfa plants {{as well as the}} uptake by the plants, due to irrigation with such quality of <b>sewage</b> <b>water,</b> has been also determined. Prolonged irrigation of alfalfa plants with <b>sewage</b> <b>water</b> increased the nodulation, dry weight yields, nitrgenase activity and the nitrogen contents of the plants grown on calcareous sandy loam soil as compared with those irrigated with tap water. The highest increase was obtained when <b>sewage</b> <b>water</b> was diluted with tap water by 4 : 1, respectively. Inoculation of alfalfa with Rhizobium meliloti and irrigation with <b>sewage</b> <b>water</b> stimulated the nodule formation and the symbiotic N 2 -fixation.

The present study was conducted to assess effect of <b>sewage</b> <b>water</b> on the uptake of Ni, Pb and Mn in different forage species with respect to the nutrient requirement of the grazing ruminants inSargodha,Punjab,Pakistan.

High value of Pb and Mn concentrations was ob served during <b>sewage</b> <b>water</b> treatment. Lead is a non-essential element and is a very toxic metal.

In conventional method, the chlorination of water results in the formation of toxic organo-chlorine products, which are mutagenic and carcinogenic in nature. A preliminary study was conducted to evaluate the effects of electron beam radiation on <b>sewage</b> <b>water.</b> Results obtained at dose rate (3  kGy) were shown to be more efficient for the disinfection of <b>sewage</b> <b>water</b> and at same dose rate showed a substantial improvement in waste water quality with an efficient decrease in organic load that lead to a better bioremediation process. On irradiation, the organic matter in <b>sewage</b> <b>water</b> will be degraded via transforming from complex to simpler molecular forms that are easily metabolized by native soil microflora during irrigation. Therefore, this study stresses the advantage of the use of electron beam radiation for <b>sewage</b> <b>water</b> remediation. Similarly at high dose rate (6  kGy) the removal percentage of organic load in sewage increased up to 50 % of their initial load. Moreover, our study defends the use of ionizing radiation in two ways for treatment of sewage water: lower dose rate for helping bioremediation and disinfection during tertiary treatment process and higher dose rate for reduction of organic load present in <b>sewage</b> <b>water.</b>|$|R
