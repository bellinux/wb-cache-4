25|$|Cigars: Cigars are {{tightly rolled}} bundles of dried and {{fermented}} tobacco which are ignited so that smoke may {{be drawn into}} the smoker's mouth. They are generally not inhaled {{because of the high}} alkalinity of the smoke, which can quickly become irritating to the trachea and lungs. The prevalence of cigar smoking varies depending on location, historical period, and population surveyed, and prevalence estimates vary somewhat depending on the <b>survey</b> <b>method.</b> The United States is the top consuming country by far, followed by Germany and the United Kingdom; the US and Western Europe account for about 75% of cigar sales worldwide. As of 2005 it is estimated that 4.3% of men and 0.3% of women smoke cigars in the USA.|$|E

The paper then investigates the use of <b>survey</b> <b>methods</b> in Child Computer Interaction and investigates the Fun Toolkit. Three new research studies into the efficacy and usefulness of the tools are presented and these culminate in some guidelines for the future use of the Fun Toolkit.

2500|$|According {{to a study}} {{conducted}} in 2015, adverse life events and low literacy {{have an effect on}} the prevalence of HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Jamaica. [...] Through the <b>survey</b> <b>method,</b> the researchers in this experiment found that these two factors are underlying determinants of the infection, and HIV was found most prevalent in MSM who were sex workers and had been raped. These men had lower self-esteem, which often leads to a reduction in ability to practice safe sex. [...] Risk factors of HIV that have already been classified as established determinants such as receptive anal intercourse and casual sex partners tended to be more common among those MSM who had dealt with the issues formerly stated. [...] Other underlying determinants of HIV include employment as sex workers, which made up 41.1% of those surveyed, and identifying as transgender, as did 52.9% of the survey participants. [...] Overall, 31.4% of the MSM surveyed were HIV positive.|$|E
2500|$|Statistics on the {{reliability}} of incident reporting for injuries related to manipulation of the cervical spine vary. The RAND study assumed that only 1 in 10 cases would have been reported. However, Edzard Ernst surveyed neurologists in Britain for cases of serious neurological complications occurring within 24 hours of cervical spinal manipulation by various types of practitioners; 35 cases had been seen by the 24 neurologists who responded, {{but none of the}} cases had been reported. He concluded that under-reporting was close to 100%, rendering estimates [...] "nonsensical." [...] He therefore suggested that [...] "clinicians might tell their patients to adopt a cautious approach and avoid the type of spinal manipulation for which the risk seems greatest: forceful manipulation of the upper spine with a rotational element." [...] The NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination stated that the survey had methodological problems with data collection. Both NHS and Ernst noted that bias is a problem with the <b>survey</b> <b>method</b> of data collection.|$|E

2500|$|The Public Land Survey System (PLSS) is the {{surveying}} method {{developed and}} used in the United States to plat, or divide, real property for sale and settling. Also known [...] as the Rectangular Survey System, it {{was created by the}} Land Ordinance of 1785 to survey land ceded to the United States by the Treaty of Paris in 1783, following the end of the American Revolution. Beginning with the Seven Ranges, in present-day Ohio, the PLSS has been used as the primary <b>survey</b> <b>method</b> in the United States. Following the passage of the Northwest Ordinance, in 1787, the Surveyor General of the Northwest Territory platted lands in the Northwest Territory. The Surveyor General was later merged with the General Land Office, which later became a part of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Today, the BLM controls the survey, sale, and settling of the new lands, and manages the State Plane Coordinate System.|$|E
2500|$|In the THE-QS World University Rankings, the School {{was ranked}} 11th {{in the world}} in 2004 and 2005, but dropped to 66th and 67th in the 2008 and 2009 edition. The School {{administration}} asserts that the fall was due to a controversial change in <b>survey</b> <b>method</b> which was detrimental to the ratings of social science institutions. In January 2010, THE concluded that the method employed by Quacquarelli Symonds, who conducted the survey on their behalf, was flawed {{in such a way that}} bias was introduced against certain institutions, including LSE. A representative of Thomson Reuters, THE's new partner, commented on the controversy: [...] "LSE stood at only 67th in the last Times Higher Education-QS World University Rankings â€“ some mistake surely? Yes, and quite a big one." [...] Nonetheless, after the change of data provider to Thomson Reuters the following year, LSE fell even further to 86th place, with the ranking described by a representative of Thomson Reuters as 'a fair reflection of their status as a world class university'.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Health {{surveys are}} a very {{important}} component of the epidemiology toolbox, and {{play a critical role in}} gauging population health, especially in developing countries. Research on health <b>survey</b> <b>methods,</b> however, is sparse. In particular, current sampling methods are not well adapted for certain 'difficult' settings, such as emergencies, remote regions without easily available sampling frames, hidden and vulnerable population groups, urban slums and populations living under strong political pressure. This special issue of Emerging Themes in Epidemiology is entirely devoted to <b>survey</b> <b>methods</b> in such settings, and builds upon a successful conference in London highlighting problems with current approaches and possible ways forward. Greater investment in research on health <b>survey</b> <b>methods</b> is needed and will have beneficial effects for populations in need. </p...|$|R
