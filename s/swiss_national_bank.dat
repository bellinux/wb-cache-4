40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{underlying}} rationale for {{intervention in the}} foreign exchange market and argues that intervention can at times be justified due to the market producing the “wrong rate”, to mitigate the effects of exchange rate overshooting and also {{to slow down the}} process of economic adjustment.

Unfortunately, as the case of the Peoples Bank of China and the recent case of the <b>Swiss</b> <b>National</b> <b>Bank’s</b> attempts to stem the appreciation of their currencies, the side effects have shown the rapid expansion of their money supplies and low interest rates have had imposed significant costs on their economies.

40|$|The <b>Swiss</b> <b>National</b> <b>Bank's</b> January 2015 {{decision}} {{to abandon the}} Swiss franc's peg to the euro led to short-term chaos in exchange markets and had a dampening effect on the Swiss economy.

The decision also reignited policy debate on the benefi ts and drawbacks to central bank intervention in currency markets. While such intervention can be justifi ed in certain situations, such as if the market is producing the 'wrong rate', it can also impose signifi cant economic costs. The ECB's recently implemented quantitative easing programme has been regarded by many as a thinly disguised attempt to weaken the euro {{in order to improve}} the eurozone's competitiveness.

40|$|Thank you for {{the kind}} {{introduction}} and for giving {{me the opportunity to}} address this very distinguished group in the beautiful city of Zurich. The <b>Swiss</b> <b>National</b> <b>Bank’s</b> annual research conference has established itself as one of the world’s most substantive forums for discussion of monetary policy issues. The theme selected for this year’s conference, “Policy Challenges and Developments in Monetary Economics, ” is particularly timely and relevant. In the past three years, there has certainly been no shortage of policy challenges and developments in the field of monetary economics. Chairman Bernanke said, “Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. ” 2 Well, extraordinary measures have been taken. In the face of severe dislocations in financial markets and deep declines in economic activity, several central banks have lowered short-term policy rates essentially to their zero lower bound. A number of central banks—including the Federal Reserve—have also used nonstandard or “unconventional ” monetary policies. By that I mean efforts to influence interest rates and economic activity using tools other than the short-term policy rate. Before the financial crisis, most everything we knew about unconventional monetar...|$|R

25|$|In 1907, the <b>Swiss</b> <b>National</b> <b>Bank</b> {{took over}} the {{issuance}} of banknotes from the cantons and various banks. It introduced denominations of 50, 100, 500 and 1000 francs. 20-franc notes were introduced in 1911, followed by 5-franc notes in 1913. In 1914, the Federal Treasury issued paper money in denominations of 5, 10 and 20 francs. These notes were issued in three different versions: French, German and Italian. The State Loan Bank also issued 25-franc notes that year. In 1952, the national bank ceased issuing 5-franc notes but introduced 10-franc notes in 1955. In 1996, 200-franc notes were introduced whilst the 500-franc note was discontinued.|$|E

500|$|To {{fight the}} crisis some governments {{have focused on}} raising taxes and {{lowering}} expenditures, which contributed to social unrest and significant debate among economists, many of whom advocate greater deficits when economies are struggling. Especially in countries where budget deficits and sovereign debts have increased sharply, a crisis of confidence has emerged with the widening of bond yield spreads and risk insurance on CDS between these countries and other EU member states, most importantly Germany. By the end of 2011, Germany was estimated to have made more than [...] out of the crisis as investors flocked to safer but near zero interest rate German federal government bonds (bunds). By July 2012 also the Netherlands, Austria, and Finland benefited from zero or negative interest rates. Looking at short-term government bonds with a maturity of {{less than one year}} the list of beneficiaries also includes Belgium and France. While Switzerland (and Denmark) equally benefited from lower interest rates, the crisis also harmed its export sector due to a substantial influx of foreign capital and the resulting rise of the Swiss franc. In September 2011 the <b>Swiss</b> <b>National</b> <b>Bank</b> surprised currency traders by pledging that [...] "it will no longer tolerate a euro-franc exchange rate below the minimum rate of 1.20 francs", effectively weakening the Swiss franc. This is the biggest Swiss intervention since 1978.|$|E
40|$|Inflation {{expectations}} {{are a key}} variable in conducting monetary policy. However, these {{expectations are}} generally unobservable and only certain proxy variables exist, such as surveys on inflation expectations. This article offers guidance on the appropriate quantification of household inflation expectations in the Swiss Consumer Survey, where answers are qualitative in nature. We apply and evaluate different variants of the probability approach and the regression approach; we demonstrate that models that include answers on perceived inflation and allow for time-varying response thresholds yield the best results; and we show why the originally proposed approach of Fluri and Spörndli (1987) has resulted in heavily biased inflation expectations since the mid- 1990 s. Furthermore, we discuss {{some of the key}} features of Swiss household inflation expectations, i. e. the fact {{that there has been a}} shift in expectation formation since 2000 (expectations are better anchored and less adaptive, and there is lower disagreement of expectations). We suggest that this may be linked to the <b>Swiss</b> <b>National</b> <b>Bank’s</b> adjustment of its monetary policy framework around this time. In addition, we outline how expectation formation in Switzerland is in line with the sticky information model, where information disseminates slowly from professional forecasters to households...|$|R

I {{believe that we have}} learnt {{a great deal about the}} <b>Swiss</b> <b>National</b> <b>Bank’s</b> monetary policy strategy and related issues, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the participants for their contributions. Of course, I am especially grateful to Stefan Gerlach and Peter Kugler who first came up with the idea of this conference, to Marcel Savioz who coordinated it from the inside, and, last but not least, to Martina Oswald who was responsible for most of the organization. Let me try to briefly recap some of the main conclusions regarding our mon-etary policy strategy and touch on some still open issues. All in all, I think that we can conclude that the new monetary policy strategy has been very successful. It has served us – and Switzerland – well over the past ten years. It has proven flexible enough to deal with several major crises with-out having to compromise or depart from it. The performance in terms of price stability over the past ten years has been remarkable, and the volatility of infla...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} empirical {{assistance in}} forecasting monetary policy in Switzerland. After the introduction, we provide a descriptive {{analysis of the}} four cycles of rising interest rates from 1979 to 2003. It is apparent that the individual cycles diverge to greater or lesser degrees from the average rising interest rate cycle. The third section evaluates the quality of various market forecasts. Regardless of the method of measurement, they show statistically significant and systematic forecast errors. Even simple trend forecasts for money market rates seldom beat the toss of a coin. If we divide the observation periods into regimes of rising and of falling interest rates, then forecasts based on futures contracts on the 3 -month LIBOR are superior to other market variables such as forwards or consensus estimates in times when rates are rising. In the fourth section, we assess an empirical response function for the <b>Swiss</b> <b>National</b> <b>Bank?s</b> (SNB) monetary policy. Due to the long, variable time lags with which monetary policy affects the real economy, the central banks must adopt a forward-looking approach and base decisions on expectations. Hence by employing consensus forecasts, we use expectations for inflation and growth as explanatory variables. The analysis shows that the SNB has a stable interest rate policy, with inflation forecasts weighted four times more heavily than growth expectations. Assuming the SNB will behave similarly {{in the future as}} it did in the past, this rule of thumb allows us to assign historically consistent money market rates to a specific macro-economic climate.
