This study looked to assess the validity and reliability of the Four <b>Square</b> <b>Step</b> Test in patients with knee osteoarthritis. A randomised observational, repeated measures study design for inter-rater and intra-rater reliability was completed in {{men and women with}} knee osteoarthritis (N= 62). In this cohort study, patients completed a baseline assessment including the Four <b>Square</b> <b>Step</b> Test, Berg Balance Scale and Figure of 8 Walk Test, and returned within a four-week period to be reassessed to determine the inter and intra-rater reliability of the Four <b>Square</b> <b>Step</b> Test.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Falls are a {{substantial}} source of {{morbidity and mortality}} in older adults. Dance may offer fall prevention benefits for older adults who are at high risk of falling. METHODS: A double-cohort pilot study was conducted to investigate the effects of group-based dance on physical risk factors, in independent communitydwelling and retirement village-dwelling adults over 65 -years of age. The first cohort of participants (n= 7) were independent community-dwelling older adults who took part in a dance-based mobility class; the second cohort of participants (n= 14) were independent residents of a retirement village who undertook folk dancing classes. Classes were scheduled once weekly, for 9 consecutive weeks, followed by social time. Outcome measures included a 30 s seated chair stand, single leg stance, a four <b>square</b> <b>step</b> test and bipedal static sway. RESULTS: Improvements were observed pre-to post-intervention, for seated chair stand and four <b>square</b> <b>step</b> test in both cohorts and no meaningful improvement was observed for sway variables in both cohorts. Cohort 1 mobility dance: seated chair stand (d= 0. 50, p= 0. 04), single leg stance (d= 0. 57, p= 0. 03), four <b>square</b> <b>step</b> test (d= 0. 72, p= 0. 01). Cohort 2 folk dancing: seated chair stand (d= 0. 13, p= 0. 01), single leg stance (d= 0. 35, p= 0. 14), four <b>square</b> <b>step</b> test (d= 0. 55, p= 0. 03). CONCLUSION: In both cohorts, participation in dance classes was associated with favourable reductions in risk factors for falling.

40|$|Test korakanja v štirih kvadratih je bil razvit za merjenje dinamičnega, ki je pomembna sposobnost pri spreminjanju smeri in izogibanju ovir med hojo. Namen diplomske naloge je bil ugotoviti merske značilnosti testa korakanja v štirih korakih. Naš vzorec je obsegal štiri vadbene skupine, v katere je bilo skupaj vključenih 52 vadečih, in kontrolno skupino s 24 starostniki. Opazovanci so bili stari od 50 do 80 let, ki so z izjemo kontrolne skupine izvajali štiri različne tipe vadbe: vadbo moči za povečanje mišične mase na napravah, vadbo moči z gimnastičnimi vajami, ravnotežno vadbo na mehkih površinah in ravnotežno vadbo na trdih površinah. Vadba je potekala dvakrat tedensko. Pred in po devetih tednih vadbe smo opravili testiranje v Laboratoriju za kineziologijo na Fakulteti za šport Univerze v Ljubljani, kjer smo opravili meritve testa korakanja v štirih kvadratih, dosegov z nogo in rokami ter stoje v različnih pogojih na tenziometrijski plošči. 	 Rezultati testa korakanja v štirih kvadratih so pokazali statistično značilne spremembe pri vadbi ravnotežja in vadbi moči na napravah, medtem ko do značilnih sprememb rezultata ni prišlo pri vadbi moči z gimnastičnimi vajami. Metoda glavnih komponent pred in po devettedenski vadbi je izločila dve komponenti, ki smo ju glede na vrsto testa opredelili kot statična in dinamična komponenta. Statično komponento so nam predstavljali testi stoje na tenziometrijski plošči v različnih pogojih, dinamično komponento pa dosegi z nogo in rokami ter test korakanja v štirih kvadratih. Rezultati so pokazali, da test korakanja v štirih kvadratih sodi med teste, ki merijo sposobnost dinamičnega ravnotežja. Test korakanja v štirih kvadratih je po vadbi dovolj občutljiv, veljaven in zanesljiv, zato priporočamo njegovo uporabo v praksi. The Four <b>Square</b> <b>Step</b> Test {{was formed}} to measure the {{dynamics}} which is an important ability {{when it comes to}} changing directions and avoiding obstacles while walking. The purpose of the thesis was to determine the characteristics of the Four <b>Square</b> <b>Step</b> Test. Our sample was composed of four training groups with 54 participants and a control group of 24 people of advanced age. The observed people were between 50 and 80 years old. All the groups, {{with the exception of the}} control group, performed four different types of training: Strength training on the devices to increase the muscle mass, strength training with the gymnastic exercises, balance training on the soft surfaces and balance training on the hard surfaces. The training took place two times a week. Before and after the nine week training, we carried out a test at the Kinesiology Laboratory of the Faculty of Sports at the University of Ljubljana. We did the Four <b>Square</b> <b>Step</b> Test, the standing test on a tensiometric plate under different circumstances and we measured the reach with legs and arms. The results of the Four <b>Square</b> <b>Step</b> Test showed statistically typical alternations in the balance training and the strength training on the devices. There were no typical alternations of the result after the strength training with the gymnastic exercises. The method of the main components before and after the nine week training ruled out two components that were, considering the nature of the test, defined as the static and the dynamic component. The standing test on a tensiometric plate under different circumstances was the static component, whereas the reach with legs and arms and the Four <b>Square</b> <b>Step</b> Test were the dynamic components. The results showed that the Four <b>Square</b> <b>Step</b> Test belongs to the tests that measure the ability of the dynamic balance. The Four <b>Square</b> <b>Step</b> Test proved to be precise enough, valid and reliable after the training, therefore we recommend its use in practice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] This study {{examined}} the relationship between the center of pressure (COP) displacement time during the stance subphases and dynamic balance ability when elderly cross obstacles 0, 10, and 40 cm in height. [Subjects] Fifteen older adults were enrolled in this study (≥ 65 years of age). [Methods] An F-Scan System was used to measure the COP displacement time when subjects crossed obstacles 0, 10, and 40 cm in height, and the Dynamic Gait Index, Berg Balance Scale, and Four <b>Square</b> <b>Step</b> Test were used to measure dynamic balance ability. [Results] The Dynamic Gait Index, Berg Balance Scale, and Four <b>Square</b> <b>Step</b> Test were correlated with each other. Dynamic balance tests were correlated with the COP displacement time during the stance phase. At obstacle heights of 10 and 40 cm during loading response and at all heights during pre-swing, there were correlations with dynamic balance ability. However, dynamic balance ability did not affect the COP displacement time during mid-stance and terminal stance. [Conclusion] People with a lower dynamic balance ability show a larger COP displacement time during loading response and pre-swing. Therefore, dynamic balance ability can be predicted by measuring the COP displacement time...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{are used}} to investigate the connection between thermal history and physical aging in polymer glasses, in particular {{the effects of a}} temperature <b>square</b> <b>step.</b> Measurements of two-time correlation functions show that a negative temperature step causes "rejuvenation" of the sample: the entire spectrum of relaxation times appears identical to a younger specimen that did not experience a temperature step. A positive temperature step, however, leads to significant changes in the relaxation times. At short times, the dynamics are accelerated (rejuvenation), whereas at long times the dynamics are slowed (over-aging). All findings are in excellent qualitative agreement with recent experiments. The two regimes {{can be explained by the}} competing contributions of dynamical heterogeneities and faster aging dynamics at higher temperatures. As a result of this competition, the transition between rejuvenation and over-aging depends on the length of the <b>square</b> <b>step,</b> with shorter steps causing more rejuvenation and longer steps causing more over-aging. Although the spectrum of relaxation times is greatly modified by a temperature step, the van Hove functions, which measure the distribution of particle displacements, exhibit complete superposition at times when the mean-squared displacements are equal.
