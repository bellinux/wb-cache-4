5|$|Despite being a {{continuous}} oval bowl, {{each side of}} the stadium is named {{in the manner of a}} traditional football ground. All sides were initially named by compass direction (North Stand and South <b>Stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ends, East Stand and West <b>Stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sides). In February 2004, after a vote by fans, the West Stand was renamed the Colin Bell Stand in honour of the former player. The vote was almost cancelled (and the stand instead named after Joe Mercer) due to suspicions it had been hijacked by rival fans who wished to dub the renamed stand The Bell End. However, core supporters of the club made it clear they still wished the stand named after their hero. The East Stand is unofficially known by fans as the Kippax as a tribute to the very vocal east stand at the club's Maine Road ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} encourages Siva's {{friends to}} ask him to <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> student-union presidency, but he wants them to nominate Naresh (one of the group) instead. Ganesh's attempts to pacify Siva fail, and Bhavani learns about him. He considers Siva a potential replacement for J. D., whose weakness annoys him.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlain {{decided to}} <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons, and was adopted as Unionist {{candidate}} for Birmingham Ladywood. After the war ended, {{a general election}} was called almost immediately. He was elected with almost 70% of the vote {{and a majority of}} 6,833. He was 49 years old, which remains to date the oldest age at which any future Prime Minister has first been elected to the Commons.|$|E
5|$|Coxon and Laker came to {{the crease}} {{and put on a}} 41-run <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> eighth wicket. After 85 minutes of resistance, Coxon hit a catch back to Johnson, ending his first Test innings for 19, and Laker was caught behind from the same bowler, having already been dropped twice in the slips. England's last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 207/9 with Bedser on six and Wright eight, having just avoided the follow on.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker {{chose not}} to <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons in the 1930 federal election, citing health reasons. The Conservatives gained a {{majority}} in the election, and party leader R. B. Bennett became Prime Minister.

A staunch free trader, Walker campaigned as part of the Free Trade Party's endorsed ticket. He had resigned as president of the Bank of New South Wales in 1897, but remained a director. At the first federal election in March 1901, Walker was elected as a New South Wales Senator {{at the head of the}} poll.|$|E
5|$|Frequently, two Eye-related goddesses appear together, {{representing}} {{different aspects}} of the Eye. The juxtaposed deities often <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> procreative and aggressive sides of the Eye's character, as Hathor and Sekhmet sometimes do. Wadjet and Nekhbet can stand for Lower and Upper Egypt, respectively, along with the Red Crown and White Crown that represent the two lands. Similarly, Mut, whose main cult center was in Thebes, sometimes served as an Upper Egyptian counterpart of Sekhmet, who was worshipped in Memphis in Lower Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Gaming {{peripheral}} company Hori produced PlayStation 2 controllers {{modeled after}} the Tiny Bee guns Yuna uses in Final Fantasy X-2. These controllers were released only in Japan.

5|$|In 367BC, plebeians {{were allowed}} to <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> consulship, and this implicitly opened both the {{censorship}} {{as well as the}} dictatorship to plebeians. Around this time, the practice of electing military tribunes with consular authority was dropped. In 366BC, in an effort by the patricians to reassert their influence over the magisterial offices, two new offices were created. These two offices, the praetorship and the curule aedileship (so-called because its holder, like consuls and praetors, had the right to sit in a curule seat), were at first open only to patricians, but within a generation they were open to plebeians as well.|$|E
5|$|In 449 BC, the Senate promulgated the Twelve Tables as the {{centerpiece}} of the Roman Constitution. In 443 BC, the office of Censor was created, and in 367 BC, Plebeians were allowed to <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Consulship. The opening of the Consulship to the Plebeian class implicitly opened both the Censorship as well as the Dictatorship to Plebeians. In 366 BC, in an effort by the Patricians to reassert their influence over the magisterial offices, two new offices were created. While these two offices, the Praetorship and the Curule Aedileship, were at first open only to Patricians, within a generation, they were open to Plebeians as well.|$|E
5|$|Taoist temples in {{southern}} China and Taiwan may often {{be identified by}} their roofs, which feature dragons and phoenixes made from multi-colored ceramic tiles. They also <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> harmony of yin and yang (with the phoenix representing yin). A related symbol is the flaming pearl, which may be seen on such roofs between two dragons, {{as well as on}} the hairpin of a Celestial Master. In general though, Chinese Taoist architecture lacks universal features that distinguish it from other structures.|$|E
3000|$|... x_n→ x <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> strong {{convergence}} of {x_n} to x; x_n x <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> weak convergence of {x_n} to x.|$|R

5|$|The astronomical {{symbol for}} Venus {{is the same}} as that used in biology for the female sex: a circle with a small cross beneath. The Venus symbol also {{represents}} femininity, and in Western alchemy stood for the metal copper. Polished copper has been used for mirrors from antiquity, and the symbol for Venus has sometimes been understood to <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mirror of the goddess.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{has become}} a fixture in American history due to the personal nature of the feud between the Earps and the McLaury and Clanton brothers and {{the symbolism of the}} fight between lawmen and the Cowboys. The Cowboys maimed Virgil and murdered Morgan but escaped prosecution, and Wyatt's extra-legal campaign for revenge captured people's attention. The gunfight and its aftermath <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> change overcoming America as the Western frontier ceased to exist, as a nation that was rapidly industrializing pushed out what had been a largely agrarian economy.|$|E
30|$|Queuing theory mainly {{consists}} of three parts: arrival pattern, service time and service equipment. It uses three letters to represent different kinds of queuing systems, such as X/Y/Z.

5|$|The {{pattern that}} the line-ending words follow is often {{explained}} if the numbers 1 to 6 {{are allowed to}} <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> end-words of the first stanza. Each successive stanza takes its pattern based upon a bottom-up pairing of {{the lines of the}} preceding stanza (i.e., last and first, then second-from-last and second, then third-from-last and third). Given that the pattern for the first stanza is 123456, this produces 615243 in the second stanza.|$|E
5|$|Baroness Jenny Jones, the Green party's {{candidate}} in the 2012 election, and Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, declined to <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Green nomination. Six candidates were shortlisted for the nomination, with Siân Berry, the party's {{candidate in}} the 2008 election, selected by London-based members of the Green Party. Unsuccessful nominees were Jonathan Bartley (candidate for Streatham in the 2015 general election, co-founder of Ekklesia, and Work and Pensions Spokesperson for the Green Party); Tom Chance (candidate for Lewisham West and Penge in the 2015 general election and Housing Spokesperson for the Greens); Benali Hamdach (Equalities Spokesperson for the Green Party, and former National Health Service researcher); Rashid Nix (a Camera operator and candidate for Dulwich and West Norwood in the 2015 general election); and Caroline Russell (Islington Borough Councillor for Highbury East Ward since 2014 and clean air campaigner).|$|E

Having been appointed convener of the Scottish Parliament's Social Justice Committee in 2001, she obtained her first ministerial role in October 2004.

Following a review of how the Labour Party in Scotland is structured, she became its first overall leader.|$|E
