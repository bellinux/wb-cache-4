40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} a deformable <b>slider</b> <b>joint</b> in the framework of a multibody simulation environment. A <b>slider</b> <b>joint</b> constrains the motion of a rigid body point along a line: a deformable <b>slider</b> <b>joint</b> allows the constrained point to move along a series of deformable beams, switching {{from one to the other}} without encountering serious numerical discontinuities. The behavior of the deformable slider is influenced both by the slider constraint and by the beam formulation, as the slider introduces a concentrated load at arbitrary points along the beam. This joint element proves to be fundamental in the study of telescopic landing gear dynamics. In fact, an application concerning the spring-back phenomena clearly demonstrates the importance of correctly modeling the strut deformability...|$|E

Regard the structure of solid-webbed telescopic jib with elliptical cross section as research object; analyze its feasibility and rationality of six kinds of treatment ways comparatively combining results by means of FEA software ANSYS and strength calculation theory in the overlapping and non-overlapping zones on simplification basis of the actual conditions of jib. It is found that the model’s FEA results with the coplanar way in the fixed junction surfaces occur serious distortion phenomenon through the whole analysis and comparison, which the degree of distortion reaches 354. 5 %, indicating that this treatment way has failed; The FEA results of model which sliding contact surfaces are disposed of contact nonlinear analysis are greater than the results of model which sliding contact surfaces are disposed of linear node coupling, there is no stress concentration phenomenon {{in this kind of}} treatment way, the simulation results are safer than before, and it is more consistent with the actual contact condition. Due to the contact analysis is a kind of nonlinear analysis behaviour which needs more computer resource. Therefore, the actual calculation results can be obtained more actually and economically if the node coupling is adapted to the <b>slider</b> <b>joint</b> while computer resource is nervous...|$|E
40|$|Cyclic {{stick-slip}} friction is {{a well-known}} phenomenon in which the relative motion between two parts involved is intermittent. The relative motion due to external excitation, support compliance of the parts in contact, {{and the difference between}} the static and kinetic friction coefficients contribute to this cyclic stick-slip motion. This paper presents a study on how various vehicle parameters affect the stick-slip vibration in the <b>slider</b> <b>joint</b> between steering intermediate shafts. The vibration was simulated using a full vehicle ADAMS model for a maneuver where the vehicle is braking while negotiating a sharp corner. The steering subsystem, which was elaborated in ADAMS/PRE templates for this particular issue, consists of the steering wheel, the steering column, the pinion input shafts, the upper and lower intermediate shafts. The cornering and braking event generates the relative velocity and the torque between the intermediate shafts, which are the most important contributing factors leading to the cyclic friction. The simulation was able to duplicate the stick-slip vibration observed in road tests...|$|E

The result is simple to derive and implement, so in addition to providing numerical solutions, the approach facilitates analytical explorations. The procedure leads to a generalized eigenvalue problem of minimal size. Both input/output problems and the derivation of tracing curve equations are addessed.

40|$|Abstract. Modelling of {{mechanisms}} is not {{a trivial}} task because the goal {{is not only to}} obtain consistent kinematics but also to get proper dynamic loads. Therefore, a modular modelling approach is preferred for large and complex mechanisms. This paper discusses modular bond graph modelling of planar mechanical systems composed of rigid bodies, which are constrained together through a set of joints. Bond graph models of revolute joints with clearance and/or flexibility and mass distribution in prismatic or <b>slider</b> <b>joints</b> are de-veloped. Bond graph models obtained from hierarchical composition of subsystem models are then used to calculate the dynamic loads. Two separate mechanisms are considered as illustrative examples and their bond graph models are validated through numerical simulations...|$|R
40|$|Legged robots {{are able}} to move across {{irregular}} terrains and those based on 1 -degree-of-freedom planar linkages can be energy efficient, but are often constrained by a limited range of gaits which can limit their locomotion capabilities considerably. This article reports {{the design of a}} novel reconfigurable Theo Jansen linkage that produces a wide variety of gait cycles, opening new possibilities for innovative applications. The suggested mechanism switches from a pin-jointed Gr??bler kinematic chain to a 5 -degree-of-freedom mechanism with <b>slider</b> <b>joints</b> during the reconfiguration process. It is shown that such reconfigurable linkage significantly extend the capabilities of the original design, while maintaining its mechanical simplicity during normal operation, to not only produce different useful gait patterns but also to realize behaviors beyond locomotion.

30|$|Tilting {{mechanism}} The {{purpose of}} the tilting mechanism {{is to increase the}} number of DOFs of the calibration board. It allows calibration trajectories to be in three-dimensional space. Figure  2 c, d shows the tilting mechanism. To increase the number of DOFs while retaining sufficient stiffness of the calibration table, a 3 -DOF ball joint with high stiffness was used in the tilting mechanism. The calibration board can tilt in roll and pitch directions. A wing nut on the ball <b>joint</b> <b>slider</b> is used to fix the ball <b>joint</b> <b>slider</b> and aluminum extrusion (see Fig.  2 c, d). Therefore, the calibration broad rotates in roll and pitch direction via the tilting mechanism.|$|R

Kinematic constraints can be considered to have two basic forms, (i) constraints that arise from hinges, <b>sliders</b> and cam <b>joints</b> that define {{the construction of the}} system, called holonomic constraints, and (ii) constraints imposed on the velocity of the system such as the knife-edge constraint of ice-skates on a flat plane, or rolling without slipping of a disc or sphere in contact with a plane, which are called non-holonomic constraints. The following are some common examples.|$|R

It starts by translating assembly mating conditions into corresponding kinematics pairs. It then calculates kinematics and dynamics data of the moving mechanism. Each component in mechanism, if viewed separately, is under balanced set of loads: joint reactions and inertial forces. Such isolated component behaves like structure, i. e. firmly supported object and FEA can deals with it. In short, motion analysis feeds FEA with data necessary to convert mechanism component into a structure- a form digestible to FEA. These two numerical tools are applied on the above-knee prosthesis. The first, prosthesis assembly is made. Mating conditions are translated into kinematics pairs such as <b>sliders,</b> pin <b>joints</b> and fixed joints. Then, motion-analysis of prosthesis mechanism is done under subjected loads. The last, components in the foot assembly are remodeled, analyzed and optimized in FEA software, using reactions and inertial forces obtained from motion analysis...|$|R

40|$|Tesis presentada por Nicolás Rojas a través del programa de doctorado "Automàtica, Robòtica i Visió" y realizada en el Institut de Robòtica i Informàtica Industrial, CSIC-UPC. This thesis {{addresses}} the kinematic analysis of mechanisms, in particular, the position analysis of kinematic chains, or linkages, that is, mechanisms with rigid bodies (links) interconnected by kinematic pairs (joints). This problem, of completely geometrical nature, consists {{in finding the}} feasible assembly modes that a kinematic chain can adopt. An assembly mode is a possible relative transformation between the links of a kinematic chain. When an assignment of positions and orientations is made for all links {{with respect to a}} given reference frame, an assembly mode is called a configuration. The methods reported in the literature for solving the position analysis of kinematic chains can be classified as graphical, analytical, or numerical. The graphical approaches are mostly geometrical and designed to solve particular problems. The analytical and numerical methods deal, in general, with kinematic chains of any topology and translate the original geometric problem into a system of kinematic analysis of all the Assur kinematic chains resulting from replacing some of its revolute <b>joints</b> by <b>slider</b> <b>joints.</b> Thus, it is concluded that the polynomials of all fully-parallel planar robots can be derived directly from that of the widely known 3 -RPR robot. In addition to these results, this thesis also presents an efficient procedure, based on distance and oriented area constraints, and geometrical arguments, to trace coupler curves of pin-jointed Gr¨ubler kinematic chains. All these techniques and results together are contributions to theoretical kinematics of mechanisms, robot kinematics, and distance plane geometry. equations that defines the location of each link based, mainly, on independent loop equations. In the analytical approaches, the system of kinematic equations is reduced to a polynomial, known as the characteristic polynomial of the linkage, using different elimination methods —e. g., Gr¨obner bases or resultant techniques. In the numerical approaches, the system of kinematic equations is solved using, for instance, polynomial continuation or interval-based procedures. In any case, the use of independent loop equations to solve the position analysis of kinematic chains, almost a standard in kinematics of mechanisms, has seldom been questioned despite the resulting system of kinematic equations becomes quite involved even for simple linkages. Moreover, stating the position analysis of kinematic chains directly in terms of poses, with or without using independent loop equations, introduces two major disadvantages: arbitrary reference frames has to be included, and all formulas involve translations and rotations simultaneously. This thesis departs from this standard approach by, instead of directly computing Cartesian locations, expressing the original position problem as a system of distance-based constraints that are then solved using analytical and numerical procedures adapted to their particularities. In favor of developing the basics and theory of the proposed approach, this thesis focuses on the study of the most fundamental planar kinematic chains, namely, Baranov trusses, Assur kinematic chains, and pin-jointed Gr¨ubler kinematic chains. The results obtained have shown that the novel developed techniques are promising tools for the position analysis of kinematic chains and related problems. For example, using these techniques, the characteristic polynomials of most of the cataloged Baranov trusses can be obtained without relying on variable eliminations or trigonometric substitutions and using no other tools than elementary algebra. An outcome in clear contrast with the complex variable eliminations require when independent loop equations are used to tackle the problem. The impact of the above result is actually greater because it is shown that the characteristic polynomial of a Baranov truss, derived using the proposed distance-based techniques, contains all the necessary and sufficient information for solving the positionMy doctoral studies and the research reported in this thesis have been partially developed under the activities of: The Catalonian Reference Network in Advanced Production Technologies (XaRTAP), and have been partially supported by: The Colombian Ministry of Communications and Colfuturo through the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) National Plan of Colombia,.

40|$|LATDYN is a {{computer}} code for modeling the Large Angle Transient DYNamics of flexible articulating structures and mechanisms involving joints about which members rotate through large angles. LATDYN extends and brings together some of the aspects of Finite Element Structural Analysis, Multi-Body Dynamics, and Control System Analysis; three disciplines that have been historically separate. It combines significant portions of their distinct capabilities into one single analysis tool. The finite element formulation for flexible bodies in LATDYN extends the conventional finite element formulation by using a convected coordinate system for constructing the equation of motion. LATDYN's formulation allows for large displacements and rotations of finite elements subject to the restriction that deformations within each are small. Also, the finite element approach implemented in LATDYN provides a convergent path for checking solutions simply by increasing mesh density. For rigid bodies and joints LATDYN borrows extensively from methodology used in multi-body dynamics where rigid bodies may be defined and connected together through joints (hinges, ball, universal, <b>sliders,</b> etc.). <b>Joints</b> may be modeled either by constraints or by adding joint degrees of freedom. To eliminate error {{brought about by the}} separation of structural analysis and control analysis, LATDYN provides symbolic capabilities for modeling control systems which are integrated with the structural dynamic analysis itself. Its command language contains syntactical structures which perform symbolic operations which are also interfaced directly with the finite element structural model, bypassing the modal approximation. Thus, when the dynamic equations representing the structural model are integrated, the equations representing the control system are integrated along with them as a coupled system. This procedure also has the side benefit of enabling a dramatic simplification of the user interface for modeling control systems. Three FORTRAN computer programs, the LATDYN Program, the Preprocessor, and the Postprocessor, make up the collective LATDYN System. The Preprocessor translates user commands into a form which can be used while the LATDYN program provides the computational core. The Postprocessor allows the user to interactively plot and manage a database of LATDYN transient analysis results. It also includes special facilities for modeling control systems and for programming changes to the model which take place during analysis sequence. The documentation includes a Demonstration Problem Manual for the evaluation and verification of results and a Postprocessor guide. Because the program should be viewed as a byproduct of research on technology development, LATDYN's scope is limited. It does not have a wide library of finite elements, and 3 -D Graphics are not available. Nevertheless, it does have a measure of "user friendliness". The LATDYN program was developed {{over a period of several}} years and was implemented on a CDC NOS/VE & Convex Unix computer. It is written in FORTRAN 77 and has a virtual memory requirement of 1. 46 MB. The program was validated on a DEC MICROVAX operating under VMS 5. 2...|$|R
