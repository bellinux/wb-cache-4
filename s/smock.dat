5|$|Although most of {{the figures}} are generic {{representations}} of human forms in various walks and stages of life, Taft included himself, {{with one of his}} assistants following him, along {{the west side of the}} sculpture. He is portrayed wearing a <b>smock,</b> with his head bowed and hands clasped behind his back. His daughters served as models for some of the figures.|$|E
5|$|Embroidery styles for smock-frocks {{varied by}} region, {{and a number}} of motifs became {{traditional}} for various occupations: wheel-shapes for carters and wagoners, sheep and crooks for shepherds, and so on. Most of this embroidery was done in heavy linen thread, often in the same color as the <b>smock.</b>|$|E

40|$|In many findings, <b>smocking</b> is {{classified}} {{as a kind of}} craftsmanship, which stated as a kind of embroidery technique to control fabric fullness by creating gathers and enhances elasticity in garments. (Dorothea Hall, 1999) It had been applied in various textiles products such as pillow, costume and curtain from Middle Ages to present. <b>Smocking</b> commonly uses in cuffs, bodices, neckline and waistline in costume. In these decades, <b>smocking</b> has been transformed from costume and living goods to fashion and art pieces. It is commonly found in high-street fashion collections and, even, used as a media by many modern textiles artists for expressing concept and ideas as well. Those textiles artists developed their own interpretations of conventional <b>smocking</b> stitches to secure folds and create aesthetic effect. <b>Smocking</b> varies in combination of pattern, stitches, threading and fabric. This paper aimed to explore more possibilities through developing contemporary <b>smocking</b> by combining innovative techniques and materials. It may also provide a reference for designers who would like to explore the possible application of contemporary <b>smocking</b> to garments or textiles. 1...|$|R
50|$|<b>Smocking</b> {{refers to}} work done before a garment is assembled. It usually {{involves}} reducing {{the dimensions of}} a piece of fabric to one-third of its original width, although changes are sometimes lesser with thick fabrics. Individual <b>smocking</b> stitches also vary considerably in tightness, so embroiderers usually work a sampler for practice and reference when they begin to learn <b>smocking.</b>|$|R

5|$|Sheerness has {{had four}} windmills. They were the Little Mill, a <b>smock</b> mill that was {{standing}} before 1813 and burnt down on 7 February 1862; The Hundred Acre Mill, a small tower mill which was last worked in 1872 and demolished in 1878 leaving a base which remains today; The Great Mill, a <b>smock</b> mill, {{the building of}} which was started in 1813 and completed in 1816, which was demolished in 1924 leaving the base, upon which a replica mill body is being built to serve as flats. On 23 January 2008 a fire started in the mill tower. The fire was declared {{not to have been}} a case of arson; Little is known of the fourth windmill, said to have been a vertical axle windmill designed by Stephen Hooper.|$|E
5|$|As the {{men were}} {{equipped}} for raiding operations and only lightly armed, they did not carry anti-gas protective equipment or large packs, and the standard British steel helmet {{was replaced by a}} woollen cap comforter. Instead of heavy ammunition boots they wore lightweight rubber soled gym shoes that allowed them to move silently. All ranks carried a toggle rope, several of which could be linked together to form longer ropes for scaling cliffs or other obstacles. During boat operations an inflatable lifebelt was worn for safety. The Commandos were the first unit to adopt the Bergen rucksack to carry heavy loads of ammunition, explosives, and other demolition equipment. A battle jerkin was produced to wear over battledress and the airborne forces' camouflaged Denison <b>smock</b> became standard issue for Commando forces later in the war.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Smocking</b> {{requires}} lightweight fabric with {{a stable}} weave that gathers well. Cotton and silk are typical fiber choices, often in lawn or voile. <b>Smocking</b> is {{worked on a}} crewel embroidery needle in cotton or silk thread and normally requires three times the width of initial material as the finished item will have. [...] Historically, <b>smocking</b> was also worked in piqué, crepe de Chine, and cashmere. [...] According to Good Housekeeping: The Illustrated Book of Needlecrafts, [...] "Any type of fabric can be <b>smocked</b> if it is supple enough to be gathered." ...|$|R

5|$|In 1967, Power {{enrolled}} at Brandeis as a sociology major and honor student {{at a time}} of anti-Vietnam War protests at the school. She became known for wandering the campus braless and barefoot in an orange-colored <b>smock,</b> for her attendance at Students for a Democratic Society protest rallies and for her involvement in the Brandeis Strike Information Center. She and her room-mate Susan Saxe worked to organize student protests for a committee known as the National Student Strike Force. The two also became acquainted with fellow organizer Stanley Ray Bond, an ex-convict and soldier attending classes at the university on a special program.|$|E
5|$|There was {{an ancient}} {{farmstead}} from the 1st {{century to the}} 3rd century in the Upminster area, and agriculture was the predominant industry throughout the following centuries. The area was once wooded, but clearances in the 12th century gave more land over to arable farming; and by the 17th century there were a variety of crops and livestock. There was a growth in market gardening in the 19th century. There {{have been a number}} of windmills in Upminster and one of which, a <b>smock</b> mill built in 1803, remains. Local industry included a tannery, gravel extraction and a brick works that was connected to the railway station by a tramway in 1895.|$|E
5|$|The orchard {{contains}} {{fruit trees}} such as quinces, medlars, crab {{apples and pears}} are underplanted with spring-flowering meadow plants such as snakeshead fritillaries, camassias, narcissus, cowslips and lady's <b>smock.</b> The orchard is crossed by wide mown paths meeting at a central sundial. Originally four weeping elms were situated at {{the four corners of}} the garden, but they succumbed to Dutch elm disease in the early seventies and were replaced in 1973 by four weeping ash trees which make inviting 'houses'. The orchard can be viewed from the raised walk on its east side, another idea copied from Avebury Manor. A main path known as the Long walk is based on the Long Walk at Hidcote Manor Garden in Gloucestershire, although it is on a smaller scale. It is a plain grassed walkway connecting the Raised Walk with the Pond Garden.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Smocking</b> is {{a sewing}} or {{embroidery}} technique {{in which the}} tiny pleats are drawn together with thread or yarn. Before the development of elastic, <b>smocking</b> was used to provide a stretchable, flexible panel of fabric.|$|R

5|$|Maylam {{concluded}} {{that at the}} time, {{there was only one}} hooden horse still in active use in Thanet, that stored at Hale Farm in St. Nicholas-at-Wade, which he noted was brought out each Christmas to visit Sarre, Birchington and St. Nicholas-at-Wade itself. The members included a man in female garb, known as the Mollie, in their procession, but added that this had not been done for some time and was thus reintroduced for Maylam's benefit. In his book, Maylam included a photograph of the horse taken at Sarre in 1905. On Christmas Eve 1906, Maylam encountered a second hooden horse, this time at Walmer. This horse came into the local hotel tearoom at about 6.30pm, accompanied by two musicians – one playing the tambourine and the other the concertina – and a man named Robert Laming who lead the horse itself. They were wearing ordinary clothes, but informed Maylam that they had once worn <b>smock</b> frocks as part of the tradition. They had no Mollie, and the members could not recall a Mollie ever having been part of their custom. The hotel owner's daughter placed a gratuity in the horse's mouth, before the troupe moved on to the local shops, where they were also given gratuities in a similar manner. Maylam talked to the troupe about the tradition, and eventually organised the photographing of the Walmer horse and those who accompanied it in March 1907.|$|E

50|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century, wearing of {{traditional}} smock-frocks by country laborers was dying out, although Gertrude Jekyll noticed them in Sussex during her youth, and <b>smocks</b> were still worn {{by some people}} in rural Buckinghamshire into the 1920s. As the authentic tradition was fading away, a romantic nostalgia for England's rural past, as epitomized by the illustrations of Kate Greenaway, led to a fashion for women's and children's dresses and blouses loosely styled after smock-frocks. These garments are generally of very fine linen or cotton and feature delicate <b>smocking</b> embroidery done in cotton floss in contrasting colors; <b>smocked</b> garments with pastel-colored embroidery remain popular for babies.|$|R
