5|$|Pontecorvo {{created a}} neutron source using radium and beryllium, as the Via Panisperna boys had, with {{paraffin}} wax as a neutron moderator, and measured {{the absorption of}} different minerals using methods developed by Fermi and Amaldi. By June 1941, he had a device that could differentiate shale, limestone and sandstone, and map the transitions between them. The technique may be considered the first practical application {{of the discovery of}} slow neutrons, and would <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> use decades later for well logging. He filed four patents relating to his instrumentation.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for the {{development}} and testing of the critical detonators was shared between Lauritsen's group at Caltech and Robert Henderson's group at Los Alamos. By mid-1945, the object was to produce 1,000 detonators each week. Meeting this target proved challenging. Reliability was the key problem, with initial batches containing unacceptably high numbers of failures. In May 1945, a box of detonators manufactured by Raytheon fell from a truck and tumbled down a mountain side, but were found to <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> working order.|$|E

5|$|A person's {{history of}} taking {{paracetamol}} is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis. The {{most effective way}} to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug nomogram developed in 1975, called the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion. To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury. A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the process of being absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a serum level taken before 4hours is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Hunter's {{direction}} in some scenes {{was inspired by}} Otto Preminger's work on the 1945 film noir Fallen Angel. That film featured several scenes shot in tight spaces with a very small mise en scène; Hunter found himself using several of Preminger's techniques {{to make the most}} out of several of the episode's smaller sets such as the RR Diner. Several scenes in the episode were also shot using a split diopter lens, allowing for a greater depth of field. For example, a scene featuring Sherilyn Fenn and Richard Beymer talking had the actors at either side of a room; the split diopter lens allowed for both of them to <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> sharp focus. The episode ends with a shot featuring a Dutch angle; Hunter was the only director on the series who Frost and Lynch allowed to use this shot, which was otherwise forbidden.|$|E
5|$|Just {{weeks after}} Letcher's inauguration, William Henry Harrison {{prevailed in the}} 1840 presidential election. Soon after, Harrison visited Letcher in Frankfort to discuss the {{appointment}} of Letcher's friend John J. Crittenden to Harrison's cabinet. On December 14, 1840, Letcher wrote Crittenden {{to tell him that}} the General Assembly would shortly re-elect him to his Senate seat. If he (Crittenden) were going to accept a position in President Harrison's cabinet, Letcher would prefer he do it before March 4, 1841 so the General Assembly would <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> session to elect Crittenden's replacement in the Senate. On January 11, 1841, Crittenden replied that he expected to be named attorney general and believed he could accept the post before Letcher's preferred deadline. However, due to Harrison's death only a month after his inauguration, Crittenden was not able to keep Letcher's timeline; he was appointed attorney general by John Tyler on March 5, 1841.|$|E

5|$|The Song court {{returned}} to Hangzhou in 1133, {{and the city}} was renamed Lin'an. The imperial ancestral temple was built in Hangzhou later that same year, {{a sign that the}} court had in practice established Hangzhou as the Song capital without a formal declaration. It was treated as a temporary capital. Between 1130 and 1137, the court would sporadically move to Jiankang, and back to Hangzhou. There were proposals to make Jiankang the new capital, but Hangzhou won out because the court considered it a more secure city. The natural barriers that surrounded Hangzhou, including lakes and rice paddies, made it more difficult for the Jurchen cavalry to breach its fortifications. Access to the sea made it easier to retreat from the city. In 1138, Gaozong officially declared Hangzhou the capital of the dynasty, but the label of temporary capital would <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> place. Hangzhou would remain the capital of the Southern Song for the next 150 years, growing into a major commercial and cultural center.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall bowled {{a series}} of short balls. One hit Compton on the arm and the batsman {{attempted}} to hook another bouncer, but edged it into his face. Upon hearing the umpire's call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect {{the ball into the}} leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that it rebounded from his head and flew more than halfway to the boundary before landing. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. After a ten-minute delay, Crapp strode to the centre for his debut innings, and he got off the mark from his first ball, gliding Lindwall past gully for a single. Lindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with another short ball, provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Harold Larwood, a 1930s paceman who targeted batsmen with Bodyline, a strategy of intimidatory bowling. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive play, resulting in one 25-minute period during which only one run was added, as England reached lunch with their total on 57/2. Edrich had made 14 from 90 minutes of batting, while Crapp had made 11 in 60 minutes. One of the motives of batting slowly without taking risks was to ensure the innings lasted long enough that it would <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> progress by the time Compton recovered from his concussion, so he could resume batting. Edrich appeared to be lacking in confidence due to his recent run of low scores, and thus hesitant to play with any attacking intent, whereas Crapp was usually circumspect. For {{a series of}} accurate overs from Ernie Toshack, Crapp repeatedly defended a sequence of deliveries to Arthur Morris at silly point. Toshack's first five overs were all maidens.|$|E
