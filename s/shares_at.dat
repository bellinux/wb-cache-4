5|$|Following its collapse, {{there was}} some {{speculation}} about whether Great Southern had disclosed to the market issues with the rate of return {{it was going to}} achieve on some of its timber investments. During parliamentary committee inquiries, these allegations were extended to the possibility that the auditors had been misled. It was also noted that, at the time that difficulties were emerging for Great Southern, its CEO sold some of his <b>shares</b> <b>at</b> the top of the companies' fortunes for $32.6 million.|$|E
5|$|Although not a {{director}} or significant shareholder {{of the new}} company, Pearson continued to promote the project {{over the next few}} years and use his influence to help the company raise the £1 million of capital needed for the construction of the line. He issued a pamphlet, A twenty minutes letter to the citizens of London, in favour of the Metropolitan Railway and City Station, encouraging investment and he even persuaded the City of London to invest on the basis that the railway would alleviate the City's congestion problems. Once the railway was in operation, the City sold its <b>shares</b> <b>at</b> a profit. By 1860, the funds had been collected and the final route decided. Work on the railway started; taking less than three years to excavate through some of the worst slums of Victorian London and under some of the busiest streets.|$|E
5|$|To {{compete in}} this market, Roberts needed more capital. He took MITS public in November 1973 with a stock {{offering}} of 500,000 <b>shares</b> <b>at</b> $1 each. The 1973 oil crisis caused {{a stock market}} downturn and MITS was only able to sell 250,000 shares. This allowed MITS {{to pay off the}} existing debt, but did not allow for any expansion. Roberts had developed several test equipment products such as a Waveform Generator and a Digital Voltmeter so he attempted to appeal to kit builders again by featuring the test equipment and digital clocks in the advertisements, instead of calculators. MITS was losing money, and by July 1974, the full page prominent ads were replaced with quarter-page ads {{in the back of the}} magazine.|$|E

5|$|In 1801, trade {{along the}} canal commenced; goods {{initially}} {{had to be}} unloaded at Foxhangers {{at the bottom of}} what is now Caen Hill Locks, transported up the hill by a horse-drawn railway, and reloaded into barges at the top. When the flight of locks opened in 1810, allowing the same vessel to navigate the entire canal, the rate of carriage per ton from London to Bath was £29s6d. This compared well with carriage by road, which cost £63s to £7 per ton, and trade on the canal flourished. In 1812, the Kennet and Avon Canal Company bought the Kennet Navigation, which stretched from Newbury to the junction with the Thames at Kennet Mouth, near Reading. The purchase from Frederick Page cost £100,000, of which £70,000 was paid in cash with the balance paid back gradually. The purchase was authorised by the Kennet Navigation Act of June 1813, which enabled the company to raise the funds through the sale of 5,500 <b>shares</b> <b>at</b> £24 each. At the same time work was undertaken to improve the Avon Navigation, from Bristol to Bath, with the Kennet and Avon Canal Company purchasing a majority shareholding in the Avon Navigation in 1816.|$|E

25|$|An {{investor}} who {{invested in the}} original one million <b>shares</b> <b>at</b> £1 each and participated in each rights issue up to 1904, would have paid an average of £1.66 for each share. No dividends were received before 1924, but from then the average annual dividend for the next 26 years was 7.5 pence, a poor rate of return. However, from 1950, dividend rates increased sharply, reaching 75 pence a share in 1960, largely from Northern Rhodesian copper royalties.
