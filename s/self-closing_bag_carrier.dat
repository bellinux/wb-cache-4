50|$|Plastic {{shopping}} <b>bags,</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>bags,</b> {{or plastic}} grocery bags are {{a type of}} plastic bag used as shopping bags and made from various kinds of plastic. In use by consumers worldwide since the 1960s, these bags are sometimes called single-use bags, referring to carrying items from a store to a home. However, reuse for storage or trash is common, and modern plastic shopping bags are increasingly recyclable or biodegradable. In recent decades, numerous countries have introduced legislation restricting the sale of plastic bags, {{in a bid to}} reduce littering and plastic pollution.|$|R

40|$|Wales is {{the first}} country in the United Kingdom to have {{introduced}} a charge for single-use <b>carrier</b> <b>bags.</b> A 2 x 2 quasi-experimental field study {{was set up to}} evaluate the effectiveness and further attitudinal and behavioural impacts of the charge. Independent nationally representative quota samples were interviewed before and after the introduction of the <b>carrier</b> <b>bag</b> charge in Wales and at the same times in England (n= 500 each). England, where no <b>carrier</b> <b>bag</b> charge was introduced, served as the comparator for the study. The study found increases in own bag use in both countries. However, the increase was much greater in Wales than in England. The study also found evidence for the policy becoming more popular after its implementation in Wales. While support for the <b>carrier</b> <b>bag</b> charge was already high before its introduction, the Welsh population became even more supportive afterwards. Although no support was found for positive behavioural spillover, the study found changes in self-reported environmental identity that could produce positive spillover effects in the longer term.

40|$|Wales is {{the first}} country in the United Kingdom to have {{introduced}} a charge for single-use <b>carrier</b> <b>bags.</b> From the 1 st of October 2011 shoppers in Wales {{have to pay a}} compulsory five pence for each single-use <b>carrier</b> <b>bag</b> at point of sale. A controlled field experiment, comparing Welsh and English samples, was set up to evaluate the effectiveness and further attitudinal and behavioural impacts of the charge. The introduction of the <b>carrier</b> <b>bag</b> charge was used to examine whether environmental policies may become more popular after their introduction and could lead to behaviour spillover (i. e., when adoption of one behaviour leads to the adoption of another behaviour). The study found that the charge was highly effective in changing its target behaviour. While own bag use increased in both countries, the increase was much greater in Wales than in England. The study also found evidence for the policy becoming more popular after its implementation. Despite support for the <b>carrier</b> <b>bag</b> charge already being high before its introduction, the Welsh population became even more supportive afterwards.

40|$|Purpose: This article {{analyses}} {{the comments}} of consumers concerning {{the introduction of a}} minimum charge on single-use <b>carrier</b> <b>bags</b> in Scotland through the Single Use <b>Carrier</b> <b>Bags</b> Charge (Scotland) Regulations 2014. Research Methods: The data analysed in this study were collected using the BBC 'Have Your Say' online messageboard. This approach provided an opportunity to analyse the perceptions of consumers, using 335 responses that were posted the day the charge was announced, and 474 responses that were posted {{on the day of the}} introduction of the charge. The collected data were inductively analysed using thematic analysis. Findings: Like many other studies of consumer perceptions of environmental policy initiatives, the results show that public perceptions of the scheme are divergent. While some perceived the scheme to be a good idea, others argued that the charge is another form of tax on the consumer. Limitations: The study only considers the responses of those motivated to signal their opinions on the online messageboard. Implications: The policy implications of the scheme are discussed in this paper, including the importance of public engagement through consultation when introducing market-based instruments to influence pro-environmental behavioural change. Contribution: The paper makes an empirical contribution through the use of social media analysis techniques to create insights into spontaneously offered public opinion of the introduction of a charge on single-use <b>carrier</b> <b>bags</b> and thus offers a critique of the instrument from the consumer point of view. Further, this study contributes to the extant knowledge of consumer perceptions of market-based interventions and adds to the debate on <b>carrier</b> <b>bag</b> consumption...|$|R
