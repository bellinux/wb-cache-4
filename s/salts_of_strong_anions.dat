40|$|OBJECTIVE: To calculate, {{using the}} Stewart {{approach}} to acid-base disorders, the <b>strong</b> <b>anion</b> gap as an estimate for {{the contribution of}} unmeasured plasma anions other than lactate to the metabolic acidosis that characterizes severe falciparum malaria and to assess its relative prognostic significance. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: The intensive care unit of an infectious diseases hospital in southern Vietnam. PATIENTS: Consecutive adult patients (n = 268) with severe falciparum malaria. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention was clinical management in a dedicated unit. We measured baseline venous lactate, electrolytes, biochemical variables, admission arterial blood pH, and gas tensions for calculation <b>of</b> the <b>strong</b> <b>anion</b> gap. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The mean (95 % confidence interval) admission <b>strong</b> <b>anion</b> gap was 11. 1 (10. 4 - 11. 9) mEq/L, compared with lactate (geometric mean, 95 % confidence interval) at 2. 9 (2. 7 - 3. 2) mmol/L. <b>Strong</b> <b>anion</b> gap had a high predictive value for mortality (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0. 73 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 65 - 0. 82), which was independent of plasma lactate and creatinine concentrations. Renal failure and hepatic dysfunction were both associated with, but were not the sole determinants of, high levels <b>of</b> <b>strong</b> <b>anion</b> gap. CONCLUSIONS: In severe malaria, unidentified anions other than lactate {{are the most important}} contributors to metabolic acidosis, a major cause <b>of</b> death.

40|$|Iminoamino {{methylene}} bases intermediates {{are obtained}} by the decomposition of hexamethylenetetra- mine (hexamine). These are stabilized by the presence <b>of</b> <b>strong</b> <b>anions</b> such as SO 24 and HSO 4, that is, “hexamine sulfate. ” The effect of hexamine sulfate was {{closely linked to the}} strong buffering action it has on MUF resins. Its role is mainly to induce regularity of the reaction and the stability of conditions during resin networking, due to the buffer. Shifting of the polycondensation a degradation equilibrium to the left appeared to be the determinant factor. This was a consequence of maintaining a higher, constant pH during curing, due to the buffer action. The modulus of elasticity (MOE) increases the curves of hexamine sulfate-catalyzed MUF resins, confirming this trend. The resins are faster curing than when catalyzed by ammonium sulfate. The effect is valid within the narrow buffering range of pH’s used for resin hardening. Polycondensation is far too slow to occur at a much higher pH, and degradation is, instead, more predominant at much lower pH’s. The network formed is then more crosslinked and less tainted by degra- dation when curing occurs within the correct pH range. The result is a much better performance of the wood board after water attack. The effects induced by hexamine sulfate effects are of longer duration than those of other potential buffers. This is due to the hexamine sulfate heat stability under standard hot curing conditions of the resin. Alternate systems were found and shown to have a comparable effect...|$|R

Previous re-searches, cited in the reference-list, have concerned themselves with the alkali metal soaps of oleic, ricinoleic, linoleic and other fatty acids, which until recently have been the best known of the surface-active materials of known constitution; recently, how-ever, there have been synthesized a number of compounds pos-sessing a high degree of surface activity. Among these are the alkylated naphthalene sulphonic acids. These new surface-active compounds have certain character-istics which are not possessed by the fatty acid soaps. Solutions of the alkylated naphthalene sulfonates are extremely stable, being unaffected by organic acids, mineral acids, and alkalies; unlike the soaps, they retain their activity in the presence of lime and magnesium salts, and in general are more resistant to metal salt formation. These compounds differ from soaps in that they lack detergent properties; they are superior to soaps in their ability to decrease solid-liquid interfacial tension, and as penetrating agents. The alkylated naphthalene sulfonates are surface active compounds which depend on the presence of nega-tively charged colloidal micelles for their surface activity.

METHODS: Placental tissue and umbilical vein plasma were collected from 10 healthy and 20 asthmatic women. Placental proteins were extracted using phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors. Samples were applied to the surfaces <b>of</b> <b>strong</b> <b>anion</b> exchange (SAX 2), weak cation exchange (WCX 2) and immobilized metal affinity capture (IMAC-Cu(2 +)) chips. Mass analysis was conducted using a Ciphergen Protein Biology System IIc (Freemont, CA), and differences in individual peak intensities between groups were determined. RESULTS: Fourteen placental peaks were significantly different between asthmatic and non-asthmatic women (seven more highly expressed and seven less highly expressed). Ten umbilical cord blood peak differences were identified, with four peaks more highly expressed and six peaks less highly expressed in asthmatics. Four placental and three umbilical cord blood proteins differed significantly {{between male and female}} fetuses. Two placental and five umbilical cord blood peaks were specifically increased in a subgroup of samples collected from asthmatic women who did not use inhaled glucocorticoids and were pregnant with a female fetus, a group previously found to have altered placental function.

Further work to positively identify the candidate peptides found in this study may provide a greater understanding of the placental mechanisms leading to alterations in fetal growth in patients with bronchial asthma.

Despite this, the possibility that these processes {{can result in a}} significant transfer of acidity to drainage solutions and consequently to associated surface waters has, to a large extent, been discounted due to the self-limiting nature of " natural" acidification processes which purportedly do not involve significant concentrations <b>of</b> the <b>strong</b> acid <b>anions</b> NO₃⁻, SO₄²⁻ and Cl⁻. In South Africa, extensive plantations of Pinus spp. (pine) are developed in mountainous regions that were previously covered by grassland or fynbos (macchia) vegetation and are mostly not believed to be influenced by significant atmospheric pollution.

This thesis documents the results of a regional investigation of the geochemical impact of pine afforestation in South Africa. The study focuses specifically on factors relating to the transfer of soil acidity to drainage waters.

This strong effect also allows the use of MUF resin of much lower melamine content while still allowing good performance of the bonded joints.

The reasons for the hexamine sulphate behaviour linked to its buffering action appeared to be due mainly to the shifting of the polycondensation ↔ degradation equilibrium of the resin to the left as a consequence of the increased pH induced by the buffering action. The presence of the buffer induces an increase in pH of between 25 % and 50 %, yielding faster hardening as a consequence of the higher SO 4 - ions content, but a much lesser extent of the simultaneous degradation reaction as a consequence of the higher pH.

The highest resolution of mixture containing conalbumin and beta-lactoglobulines A and B was obtained with a <b>strong</b> <b>anion</b> exchanger as the stationary phase in thirty minutes. The highest resolution of bovine serum albumin isoforms was achieved with a <b>strong</b> <b>anion</b> exchanger as the stationary phase in sixty minutes.

40|$|California is {{the first}} {{state in the nation}} to {{regulate}} hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI) ] in drinking water with a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 10 µg/L. To comply with the MCL, a California utility conducted extensive pilot studies to determine the best performing ion exchange resin, Empty Bed Contact Time (EBCT) and Hydraulic Loading Rate (HLR). The Cr(VI) removal capacity <b>of</b> four <b>strong</b> base <b>anion</b> (SBA-IX) exchange resins were tested at 7 wells. The results showed between 12, 000 and 37, 000 bed volumes of treatment can be expected prior to an 8 µg/L breakthrough threshold. HLR was not shown to have much impact on Cr(VI) removal within the range tested (7. 5 to 30 gpm/ft 2), while longer EBCTs (> 0. 75 minutes) appeared to improve performance. The presence of co-occurring anions in the raw water, namely sulfate and nitrate, had substantial impact on the resin’s chromium loading capacity...|$|R
40|$|A {{continuous}} climate record since 195 1 at Niwot Ridge in the Colorado Front Range shows {{a decline}} in mean annual temperature, an increase in annual precipitation amount, {{and a decrease in}} mean daily solar radiation for the summer months. The increase in precipitation amount explains about half of the 200 % increase in annual wet deposition of NO,- to Niwot Ridge over the last decade. Differences in climate parameters between 1994 and 1995 (increased snow depth and decreased net energy flux to the snowpack) resulted in a 4 - 5 -fold increase in the magnitude of solute release from the snowpack {{in the form of an}} ionic pulse. In turn, the high chemical loading <b>of</b> <b>strong</b> acid <b>anions</b> in the seasonal snowpack and release of these solutes from the seasonal snowpack in the form of an ionic pulse is causing episodic acidification (ANC < 0 peq liter-l) in headwater catchments at present deposition levels. Small changes in climate parameters may cause large changes in the hydrochemistry of alpine streams. The changes in climate at Niwot Ridge are not in synchrony with lowland warming in the Great Plains to the east and serve as a reminder that climate in alpine areas is driven by local conditions and may be asynchronous with regional and global climate trends. Many alpine regions are susceptible to environmenta...|$|R
