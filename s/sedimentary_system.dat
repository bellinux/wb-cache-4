5000|$|It is {{typically}} referred to continental clastic sediments consisting of light grey fine sandstones, coarse sandstones and glutenites {{as well as}} mottled claystones and siltstones. This lithological unit has yielded plentiful dinosaur remains in quantity and group, also including {{a great deal of}} microfossil material. The stratigraphic sequence, <b>sedimentary</b> <b>system,</b> and the morphologies and assemblages of the paleontological taxa are summarized on the basis of previous studies on the Iren Dabasu Formation. The fine-grained floodplain sediments and the coarse-grained sediments of the point bar formed a series of repeated frequently binary sedimentary rhythms. The “binary structure” of the sedimentary rhythms strongly indicates meandering stream deposits rather than braided river deposits as previously thought. The ostracod and charophyte assemblages of the Iren Dabasu Formation has suggested a potential correlation with those of the Sifangtai Formation and the basal Mingshui Formation in the Songliao Basin (mid/late Campanian age). Vertebrates point to an older date than middle-late Campanian. The turtle Khunnuchelys is known from both Iren Dabasu and Baynshirenian-equivalent units such as the Bostobe and Bissekty. In addition, a giant Caenagnathid similar to Gigantoraptor is now known from the Baynshirenian beds of Tsagaan Teg. Like the coeval Baynshiree (or possibly Javkhlant) Formation in the Gobi, the dinosaur fauna of the Iren Dabasu Formation includes tyrannosaurs, ornithomimids, therizinosaurs and oviraptors. Gigantism, such in the case of Gigantoraptor, may have been due the humid climate of the Iren Nor region during the Late Cretaceous. It may also have been due to weak contemporary tyrannosaurs, as predator decline tends to maximize herbivore diversity.|$|E

Meanwhile, the evolution and dynamics of the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>system</b> are strongly linked with the morpho-structural evolution of the subaerial part of the volcano.

40|$|Atmospheric {{noble gases}} are {{routinely}} {{used as a}} paleoclimate proxy in <b>sedimentary</b> aquifer <b>systems.</b> In contrast, noble gas studies in fractured media are rare. This dissertation pioneers the use of atmospheric noble gases as natural tracers of groundwater flow in fractured systems, and expands their use as a paleoclimate indicator in <b>sedimentary</b> <b>systems.</b> Specifically, dissolved atmospheric noble gases from basal and perched aquifers in the Galapagos Islands of Santa Cruz and San Cristobal are used to identify location and timing of recharge of these fractured, basaltic hydrologic systems. A unique, previously unknown noble gas pattern of Ne, Kr and Xe depletion together with relative Ar enrichment is also identified in high-altitude springs of the Galapagos Islands. The discovery of this unknown noble gas pattern in the Galapagos Islands lead to the first comprehensive study of noble gases carried out in rainwater using samples collected in southeast Michigan, the results of which are presented in this dissertation. This study identifies distinct rainwater noble gas patterns and investigates the association between noble gas composition in precipitation and weather patterns. This rainwater noble gas study also validates the use of noble gases as paleoclimate indicators in <b>sedimentary</b> <b>systems</b> where infiltration is slower than in fractured systems. Subsequently, this dissertation expands the use of atmospheric noble gases as paleoclimate indicators in <b>sedimentary</b> <b>systems</b> through a noble gas temperature (NGT) study {{carried out in the}} shallow Saginaw aquifer in southeast Michigan. In addition to providing a detailed ~ 13. 1 kyr paleoclimate record, the onset and termination of the Younger Dryas and Mid-Holocene climatic oscillations are identified for the first time based on NGTs. Finally, it is also shown how atmospheric noble gases can be used to provide insights into the thermal history of stable tectonic regions. Specifically, Saginaw aquifer samples located in the main discharge area of the Michigan Basin display large atmospheric noble gas excesses with respect to modern conditions and are shown to be remnants of a previously identified past thermal event. Overall, this dissertation has important scientific implications for the fields of hydrogeology, atmospheric and climate sciences, paleoclimatology and tectonics...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change during}} the Last Glacial is {{considered}} as a major forcing factor of fluvial system changes. A continuous succession of fluvial sediments, reflecting adaptations to climate change from the Weichselian Middle Pleniglacial (oxygen isotope stage 3) onwards, occurs in lowland river basins in the Netherlands. A comparison of the Pleniglacial and Late Glacial fluvial record in the Netherlands shows that climatic oscillations of similar magnitude did not produce changes in the fluvial <b>sedimentary</b> <b>system</b> of equal magnitude. The Late Glacial fluvial system proves to be highly sensitive to climate change. By contrast, many of the rapid climate {{changes that have occurred}} during oxygen isotope stage 3, according to the Greenland ice core record, are not detectable in the fluvial sediments. This can be explained by differences in the impact of the climate variations on drainage basin vegetation. During the Late Glacial, the tree line repeatedly shifted through the Netherlands, whereas the area remained within the tundra zone during the Middle Pleniglacial. Precipitation variations and permafrost aggradation and degradation have played a secondary role. The Weichselian fluvial succession in the Netherlands demonstrates that detection of a change in the fluvial <b>sedimentary</b> <b>system</b> and relating this change to climate change is subject to methodological limitations. The climatic significance of changes in the fluvial record should be carefully evaluated, as well as their chronology.
