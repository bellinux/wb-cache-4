5|$|Experiments {{investigating}} the <b>splash</b> dispersal of peridioles {{have shown a}} maximum horizontal distance for peridiole ejection of , less than that observed for other Cyathus species. This reduced ejection distance {{may be due to}} such factors as the greater size of peridioles, the looser construction of the funiculus, or the increased flaring seen in the upper lip of the <b>splash</b> cup.|$|E
5|$|The three-on-one Handicap ECW World Championship {{match between}} {{champion}} Bobby Lashley and Team McMahon (Umaga, Vince and Shane McMahon) was next. Near {{the end of}} the match, Shane hit Lashley with the title belt, which was followed by Umaga landing a top rope <b>splash</b> to Lashley. Umaga then tagged in Vince, who attempted to pin Lashley. Lashley, however, kicked out. Vince then tagged in Umaga, who once again executed a diving <b>splash</b> on Lashley. After being tagged in again, Vince pinned Lashley to win the ECW World Championship and the match for his team.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn fire scene, {{the reasons}} for the {{formation}} of <b>splashing</b> melted beads are confirmed difficultly for investigators. The paper is studying density distribution characteristics of the <b>splashing</b> melted beads in fire scene. The <b>splashing</b> PSCMB and SSCMB are gotten from experimental lab. After meaturing density of the <b>splashing</b> PSCMB and SSCMB, SPSS analysis software was used for the analyzing density data of the <b>splashing</b> PSCMB and the <b>splashing</b> SSCMB. This results showed that the density value of <b>splashing</b> PSCMB and <b>splashing</b> SSCMB have a little degree of overlapping. The overlapping scope is 6. 7 - 6. 9. So within the scope, there are 3 PSCMB and there are 2 SSCMB. The ratio is respectively 10 % and 6. 67 %. it is a good discrimination. The results could be used for helping fire investigators distinguishing the shaping reasons of <b>splashing</b> melted beads from fire scenes. This method can be the supplement for the existing appraisal method (ep. Metallographic analysis). And it is practical and effective for distinguishing from the <b>splashing</b> PSCMB and SSCMB...|$|R
40|$|In oxygen steelmaking, <b>splashing</b> and droplet {{formation}} play a {{key role}} in the kinetics of the process. Though <b>splashing</b> has been studied by previous investigators, there is only limited understanding of how different cavity modes affect <b>splashing.</b> Therefore, a cold model study (at various lance heights and gas flow rates) has been carried out focusing on the issue of cavity modes and how it affects <b>splashing</b> phenomenon. Analysis using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was carried out on cavity oscillation that showed that frequency and amplitude of oscillation was highest in penetrating mode. Measurements of <b>splashing</b> over a range of conditions showed <b>splashing</b> greatly reduced when cavities went from <b>splashing</b> to penetrating mode. The results were validated and compared with plant data and previous model investigations...|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristic}} conditions causing spreading or <b>splashing</b> after drop {{impact on}} solid surfaces are considered {{together with the}} underlying mechanisms. To this end, {{the results of the}} various studies published {{over the past few years}} that have addressed the issue of <b>splashing</b> after droplet impact, specifically in terms of the definition of a <b>splashing</b> threshold, are critically compared and synthesized. The discussion aims at clarifying some of the conflicting findings. Information drawn from these considerations is used to distinguish between various <b>splashing</b> thresholds and it is shown that there exists a distinct difference between <b>splashing</b> on smooth and on rough surfaces, both in terms of the <b>splashing</b> thresholds and in terms of the mechanisms. Finally, a physical mechanism akin to air entrainment in dynamic wetting is proposed that may be of primary importance for the inception of <b>splashing</b> as well as fingering on smooth surfaces...|$|R

Optimization of the operating condition (lance angle, lance height and flowrate) should allow less <b>splashing</b> and increase productivity. In the present study, the effect of different operating conditions {{on the wall}} <b>splashing</b> rate was investigated. Air was injected on a water surface in a small-scale thin slice model at different lance angles, lance heights and flowrates. <b>Splashed</b> liquid in the forward direction was collected and measured in each case. The forward <b>splashing</b> rate was found to increase with an increase in lance angle and flowrate. The critical depth of penetration, as well as the impact velocity for the onset of <b>splashing</b> was found to decrease with increasing angle of the lance from the vertical.

5|$|Spirit <b>Splash</b> occurs the Friday {{before the}} Homecoming game, {{and serves as}} a pep rally where {{students}} descend into the pond to demonstrate school spirit. Spirit <b>Splash</b> began in 1995 when then-Student Body President Miguel Torregrossa was pushed into the Reflecting Pond by one of his cabinet members and fellow students followed suit. Along with the thousands of students who attend, there are members of the community, local dignitaries, alumni, children and even dogs who come to join in on the festivities. Knightro, the Marching Knights, cheerleaders, student athletes, and dancers all participate in the pep rally, usually followed by a concert. Spirit <b>Splash</b> was made possible in part by weight testing performed on the Reflecting Pond in preparation for President Richard Nixon's visit to the university to speak at its 1973 commencement. It was determined {{that the best way to}} protect the president would be to hold commencement in the pond itself, after being drained, so that Secret Service agents could be stationed on the roofs of the adjacent buildings.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the interplay between}} substrate roughness and surrounding gas pressure in controlling the dynamics of <b>splashing</b> when a liquid drop hits a dry solid surface. We associate two distinct forms of <b>splashing</b> with each of these control parameters: prompt <b>splashing</b> is due to surface roughness and corona <b>splashing</b> is due to instabilities produced by the surrounding gas. The size distribution of ejected droplets reveals the length scales of the underlying droplet-creation process in both cases. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{determine the}} phase diagram for impacting ethanol droplets on a smooth, sapphire {{surface in the}} parameter space of Weber number We versus surface temperature T. We observe two transitions, namely the one towards <b>splashing</b> (disintegration of the droplet) with increasing We, and the one towards the Leidenfrost state (no contact between the droplet and the plate due to a lasting vapour film) with increasing T. Consequently, there are four regimes: contact and no <b>splashing</b> (deposition regime), contact and <b>splashing</b> (contactâsplash regime), neither contact nor <b>splashing</b> (bounce regime), and finally no contact, but <b>splashing</b> (filmâsplash regime). While the transition temperature TL to the Leidenfrost state depends weakly, at most, on We in the parameter regime of the present study, the transition Weber number WeC towards <b>splashing</b> shows a strong dependence on T and a discontinuity at TL. We quantitatively explain the <b>splashing</b> transition for T<TL by incorporating the temperature dependence of the physical properties in the theory by Riboux & Gordillo (Phys. Rev.

The Beverlys controlled the match for several minutes, with Blake executing a <b>splash</b> and a front facelock. Typhoon recovered and clotheslined both opponents {{but was unable to}} tag in Earthquake. Later, Typhoon tried to tag again, but Beau distracted Earthquake; while the referee's back was turned, The Beverlys' manager, The Genius handed Blake a metal scroll, which Blake used to hit Typhoon. Typhoon recovered, however, and Earthquake entered the ring and controlled the remainder of the match. He performed a powerslam on Beau before pinning him with an Earthquake <b>splash.</b>|$|E
5|$|When a {{raindrop}} {{hits the}} interior of the cup with the proper angle and velocity it can produce considerable force, and can create a <b>splash</b> that drives the water up along the sides of the cup (also known as <b>splash</b> cups), tearing the funiculus, and ejecting the peridioles. The peridioles are followed by their funicular cord and basal hapteron. When they hit a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridiole, attached to the plant, may be eaten by herbivorous mammals, and the subsequent passage through its digestive tract will soften the hard shell enough to facilitate later sporulation.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{formulate}} a criterion to describe the onset of <b>splashing</b> for dilute and dense suspension drops composed of hydrophilic or hydrophobic particles. The formulation is based on the analysis of the existing data from the literature and from us. The new criterion improves upon current models in predicting the <b>splashing</b> threshold by introducing effect of particle volume fraction and particle wettability. The criterion's mathematical formulation correctly describes the dependence of <b>splashing</b> on particle diameter, volume fraction, and wettability. It works equally well for predicting the onset of <b>splashing</b> on hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the impact velocity beyond which the ejection of smaller droplets {{from the main}} droplet (<b>splashing)</b> occurs for droplets impacting a smooth surface. We examine its dependence on the surface wetting properties and droplet surface tension. We show that the <b>splashing</b> velocity is independent of the wetting properties of the surface, but increases roughly linearly with increasing surface tension of the liquid. A preexisting <b>splashing</b> model is considered that predicts the <b>splashing</b> velocity by incorporating the air viscosity. The model is consistent with our data, but the calculation is complex. To address this issue, we propose a simplification, assuming atmospheric conditions and low viscosities, and show that the simplification gives an equally good prediction of the <b>splashing</b> velocity from a simple analytical formula.
