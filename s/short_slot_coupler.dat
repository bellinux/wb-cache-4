40|$|A centered-inclined {{waveguide}} <b>slot</b> <b>coupler</b> {{has been}} modeled as a series-series ideal transformer since ever. Actually this equivalent circuit is not exact, but only approximate though, for resonant couplers, the approximation being usually very good. The approximation gets worse as the slot length {{moves away from}} resonance, and is completely useless for off-resonant slots, needed in shaped-beam slot arrays. In this paper, an in-depth discussion of the properties of such a <b>slot</b> <b>coupler</b> and of the admissible approximations allows to quantitatively set the limit of the "standard" model, and leads to suitable generalizations to non-resonant slots as well. The resulting equivalent circuits are compared against full-wave simulated data and result to be very accurate in a quite large frequency range...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: An on-line partial {{discharge}} (PD) test for large steam turbine generators {{has been developed}} where {{partial discharge}}s and noise are distinguished {{on the basis of}} pulse width. The pulse signals are detected by stator <b>slot</b> <b>couplers</b> (SSCs) which are permanently installed within the generator. Experiments have shown that partial discharge pulses, as detected by an SSC, have a pulse duration of only a few nanoseconds, where all types of electrical noise have a pulse width of greater than 20 ns. An instrument called the TGA has been constructed which performs a pulse width analysis with a resolution of 2 ns. This instrument permits the rejection of noise on a pulse by pulse basis, and the subsequent pulse height and pulse phase analysis of the partial discharge pulses. The SSC/TGA test allows non-specialized personnel to perform a partial discharge test on generators in nuclear and fossil stations, without requiring a generator outage...|$|R

40|$|Rock {{grouting}} is {{a commonly}} used process for sealing rocks in tunnels to reduce water ingress. In {{order to achieve}} sufficient sealing level the grout must effectively penetrate into rock fractures while the limiting factor is filtration of cement based grout. Many devices and measuring methods {{have been developed to}} study filtration and to measure the penetrability. The filter pump and the penetrability meter are two of the most commonly used instruments for measuring filtration tendency in the field and in the lab, while <b>short</b> <b>slot</b> is used mainly in the lab. The results obtained from these devices have relatively different estimations of the penetrability partly due to the weaknesses in measuring methods and test procedures. Furthermore, there are no clear criteria to find out which of the results are closer to the reality or how much the results differ among these instruments. The aim of this study is comparing, and evaluating the results of these devices in relatively similar conditions while using more accurate methods of weight-time and pressure-time compared to the less reliable total volume method. The filter pump and the penetrability meter were modified In order to fulfill the requirement of testing in similar conditions and to improve their accuracy and versatility. The results show that increasing the pressure improves the penetrability significantly. The modification of the filter pump results in reducing many uncertainties related to the testing procedure. Probably the modified filter pump has higher accuracy in measuring the penetrability compared to regular filter pump. The <b>short</b> <b>slot</b> has the highest accuracy in estimating penetrability of cement based grout especially at higher pressures, furthermore, the <b>short</b> <b>slot</b> provides a more flexible way to measure penetrability with different pressures in the range of 1 - 15 bars...|$|R

This could be useful for sending acknowledgments for a high-speed data communication link, or for vocoder/VoIP traffic. The proposed scheme enables efficient low bit-rate transmission by dividing a DECT channel into four subbands, and by employing a new slot structure wherein TDMA overhead is kept to a minimum. It is shown that the proposed scheme can coexist with the DECT system and can be implemented using existing IMT- 2000 DECT hardware with minor modifications. A comparison is also made of the proposed scheme with existing options for low bit-rate channelization in DECT.|$|R
