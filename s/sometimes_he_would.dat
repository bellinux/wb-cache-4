5|$|When Davidson {{returned}} home {{he found that}} Molly was six months pregnant. The dates of his service leave during 1918 made it apparent {{that he was not}} the father. A daughter was born on 21 June 1919; the likely father was a Canadian army colonel, Ernest Doudemain, a friend from Davidson's schooldays who had lodged at the rectory {{in the latter part of}} 1918. Although deeply upset by his wife's infidelity, Davidson accepted the child—who bore some resemblance to him—as his own. To escape the poisoned atmosphere in Stiffkey he applied for a year's posting as chaplain to a hill station at Simla in India, but the opportunity fell through. Instead, Davidson resumed his pre-war routine of spending his weeks in London, departing early on Monday morning and returning late on Saturday. Sometimes, through a missed rail connection or other mishap, he was barely in time for the Sunday morning service at Stiffkey, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> fail to arrive at all.|$|E
5|$|In 1890 Lie {{began working}} at a rice mill {{operated}} by his friend Tan Wie Siong as a supervisor; this would be his main {{source of income for}} the remainder of his life. The following year he married Tan Sioe Nio, twenty years his junior. The new couple had a comfortable life: his salary was adequate, and the work did not consume much energy. To supplement his income Lie returned to translating, Dutch to Malay or vice versa. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> translate land deeds or other legal documents. Other times he translated works of literature. This included De Graaf de Monte Cristo, an 1894 translation of Alexandre Dumas' Le Comte de Monte-Cristo, which he completed in collaboration with the Indo journalist F. Wiggers. The two included footnotes to describe aspects of European culture which they deemed difficult for non-European readers to understand. Three years later Lie published Hikajat Kong Hoe Tjoe, a book on the teachings of Confucius. Its contents were derived from European writings on Confucianism and his friends' explanations.|$|E
5|$|Nevinson {{had four}} {{pictures}} {{included in the}} Second Exhibition of the London Group held in March 1915. Nevinson's Futurist painting, Returning to the Trenches, and the sculpture The Rock Drill by Jacob Epstein received the most attention and greatest praise in reviews of the show. After his father received assurances {{that he would not}} be posted abroad, Nevinson enlisted as a private in the Royal Army Medical Corps and spent the rest of 1915 working at the Third London General Hospital in Wandsworth. Despite its name, the 3rd LGH was a specialist centre for the treatment of both shell shock and severe facial injuries. Nevinson worked there as an orderly and as a labourer helping build roads and fit out new wards. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be sent to Charing Cross to meet, and unload, the hospital trains arriving from France and for a while he worked on a ward for mental patients. Nevinson married Kathleen Knowlman on 1 November 1915 at Hampstead Town Hall and, after a week-long honeymoon, he reported back to the RAMC but was invalided out of the service in January 1916 with acute rheumatic fever.|$|E

60|$|He {{was glad}} to sit down, {{and he said to}} himself that now <b>he</b> <b>would</b> stay there, and keep a good lookout for the chaps that had robbed him. But again he fell asleep, and he did not wake now till the sun was high, and the paths of the Common were filled with hurrying people. He sat where he had slept, for {{he did not know what}} else to do or where to go. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go to Mr. Sewell, and ask him for money enough to get home; but he could not do it; he could more easily starve.|$|R
50|$|He {{was also}} the {{commander}} of the Security Police (SiPo) and the Security Service (SD) for central Russia as well as a department chief in the Reich Main Security Office (Reichssicherheitshauptamt or RSHA). He did not hold a doctorate degree, as is <b>sometimes</b> reported. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> eventually rise to the rank of SS-Standartenführer.|$|R
25|$|Since {{his days}} in middle grade, he would often visit {{some of the local}} saints like Swami Zanakak Tufchi of Habbakadal {{locality}} and Swami Baalak Kaw, a jatadhari sadhu, at Sekidafer locality. He would also press Swami Baalak Kaw's feet at times. Yet another saint that he is known to have paid regular visits to was Swami Jeevan Sahib. He would also visit Swami Narayan Joo Bhan of Bodhgeer locality in Kashmir. He would regularly attend gatherings of these saints discussing spiritual and philosophical topics on vedanta, Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and Kashmir Shaivism. During his employment days at the grocery store, while manning the cash counter at the store, he would often be found engrossed in meditation. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> spend whole night at the store while being absorbed in meditation.|$|E
25|$|As {{a sign of}} his {{consolidation}} of power, Saddam's personality cult pervaded Iraqi society. He had thousands of portraits, posters, statues and murals erected in his honor all over Iraq. His face could {{be seen on the}} sides of office buildings, schools, airports, and shops, as well as on Iraqi currency. Saddam's personality cult reflected his efforts to appeal to the various elements in Iraqi society. This was seen in his variety of apparel: he appeared in the costumes of the Bedouin, the traditional clothes of the Iraqi peasant (which he essentially wore during his childhood), and even Kurdish clothing, but also appeared in Western suits fitted by his favorite tailor, projecting the image of an urbane and modern leader. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> also be portrayed as a devout Muslim, wearing full headdress and robe, praying toward Mecca.|$|E
25|$|Back in London, Sargent {{was quickly}} busy again. His working methods were by then well-established, {{following}} {{many of the}} steps employed by other master portrait painters before him. After securing a commission through negotiations which he carried out, Sargent would visit the client's home {{to see where the}} painting was to hang. He would often review a client's wardrobe to pick suitable attire. Some portraits were done in the client's home, but more often in his studio, which was well-stocked with furniture and background materials he chose for proper effect. He usually required eight to ten sittings from his clients, although he would try to capture the face in one sitting. He usually kept up pleasant conversation and <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> take a break and play the piano for his sitter. Sargent seldom used pencil or oil sketches, and instead laid down oil paint directly. Finally, he would select an appropriate frame.|$|E

500|$|By 1856 Quimby had 500 {{patients}} a year. He would {{sit next to}} them and explain that the disease was something their minds could control; <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> wet his hands and rub their heads, {{but it was the}} talking that helped them, he said, not the manipulation. Quimby began to write his thoughts down around 1859—his work was published posthumously as The Quimby Manuscripts in 1921—and was generous in allowing his patients to copy one of his essays, [...] "Questions and Answers." [...] This became an issue, from 1883 onwards, when Eddy was accused of having based Christian Science on his work.|$|E
500|$|In autumn 1871, Cope began {{prospecting}} {{farther west}} to the fossil fields of Kansas. Leidy and Marsh {{had been to the}} region earlier, and Cope employed one of Marsh's guides, Benjamin Mudge, who was in want of a job. Cope's companion Charles Sternberg described the lack of water and good food available to Cope and his helpers on these expeditions. Cope would suffer from a [...] "severe attack of nightmare" [...] in which [...] "every animal of which we had found trace during the day played with him at night... <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> lose half the night in this exhausting slumber." [...] Nevertheless, Cope continued to lead the party from sunrise to sunset, sending letters to his wife and child describing his finds. The severe desert conditions and Cope's habit of overworking himself till he was bedridden caught up with him, and in 1872, he broke down from exhaustion. Cope maintained a regular pattern of summers spent prospecting and winters writing up his findings from 1871 to 1879.|$|E

[...] At closing time, he would lead patrons in singing [...] "God Save Us Nelly Queens" [...] {{to the tune of}} [...] "God Save the Queen". <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> take the crowd outside to sing the final verse to the men across the street in jail, who had been arrested in raids earlier in the night. Speaking of this ritual in the film [...] (1977), gay journalist George Mendenhall said: [...] "It sounds silly, but if you lived at that time and had the oppression coming down from the police department and from society, there was nowhere to turn...and {{to be able to put}} your arms around other gay men and to be able to stand up and sing 'God Save Us Nelly Queens'...we were really not saying 'God Save Us Nelly Queens.' We were saying 'We have our rights, too.'" ...|$|E
60|$|The Captain {{then told}} them Henry's confession. He {{had been too}} much hurried by {{the fear of being}} caught, to take out his own share of the hoard, and had {{therefore}} emptied the whole cupful into his pocket- handkerchief, tied it up, and run off with it, intending to separate what was honestly his own. What that was he did not know, but his boastful habits and want of accuracy had made his memory so careless, that he fancied that a far larger proportion was his than really was, and his purposes were in the strange medley that falls to the lot of all self-deceivers, <b>sometimes</b> fancying <b>he</b> <b>would</b> only take what he had a right to (whatever that might be), <b>sometimes</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> borrow what <b>he</b> wanted, and replace it when the sovereign should be given to him, or that the Grevilles would make it up when they had their month's allowance.|$|R
5000|$|Orangey {{was called}} [...] "the world's meanest cat" [...] by one studio executive. He often {{scratched}} and bit actors. But he was prized {{for his ability}} to stay for several hours. <b>Sometimes,</b> however, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> flee after filming some scenes and production would be shut down until he could be found. Inn would sometimes have to post guard dogs at the studio entrance to keep him from running away.|$|R

2500|$|It {{was obvious}} that his {{drinking}} problem was getting worse. By this time, Bill and Martha fought {{all the time and}} she told him to stop drinking or move out. He then did move out into a room in their pool house. Martha still took care of him and <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> come in the house to eat, but he ate very little. [...] "There were days we never saw him," [...] said his daughter Martha Maria.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the episodes}} {{featuring}} his character, Mr. Bacciagalupe would often show impatience with the indecision portrayed by Lou Costello, whom he called by his Sicilian name, Luigi. As he [...] "lost his temperature", Mr. Bacciagalupe would lapse into broken Italian phrases and increasingly animated gesticulation {{to express his}} frustration. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> find his place of business wrecked by Abbott and Costello’s antics; at other times he would confound them completely and they would retreat in confusion as he crowed in triumph.|$|E
50|$|A {{recurring}} theme is {{the decline of}} civilisation; Cerdic often comments on the illiteracy of the Saxons and their simple adherence to custom, and on the advantages which his late Roman education gives him in thinking out his moves in advance. He also notes the decay of Roman buildings as they are abandoned and plundered and the dirt and uncleanliness of even Saxon nobles (whereas Roman nobles such as Cerdic himself in his youth bathed frequently). In his old age Cerdic <b>sometimes</b> thinks <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have preferred to be a Roman nobleman even though <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not have enjoyed as much personal freedom.|$|R
6000|$|... 107.

Matt. iii. 9.|$|R
6000|$|... 107. In prayer, also, I {{have been}} greatly troubled at this time; {{sometimes}} I have thought I {{should see the}} devil, nay, thought I have felt him, behind me, pull my clothes; <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be, also, continually {{at me in the}} time of prayer to have done; break off, make haste, you have prayed enough, and stay no longer, still drawing my mind away. <b>Sometimes,</b> also, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> cast in such wicked thoughts as these: that I must pray to him, or for him. I have thought sometimes of that--Fall down, or, [...] "if thou wilt fall down and worship me" [...] (Matt 4:9).|$|R
2500|$|He {{would keep}} incense sticks burning in flames {{instead of letting}} them {{smoulder}} as he had an affinity for light sources. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> also keep the oblations, offered in the fire pot, burning in flames and also {{referred to it as}} the [...] "feet" [...] of Lord Narayan. He would refer to his legs as mere [...] "logs of wood" [...] and the body as [...] "food" [...] for the God of death (Mahakal) and as such didn't consider physical body as the end-all be-all of human existence.|$|E
2500|$|His {{letters were}} very informal; <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> just write {{the name of}} the person and start the letter. He was very humorous and wrote very {{interesting}} letters. In one letter he wrote, [...] "Main koshish karta hoon ke koi aisi baat likhoon jo padhe khush ho jaaye'" [...] (I want to write lines such that whoever reads them would enjoy them). Some scholars say that Ghalib would have the same place in Urdu literature {{on the basis of his}} letters only. They have been translated into English by Ralph Russell in The Oxford Ghalib.|$|E
2500|$|Ralph Edmond Stanley was born, grew up, {{and lived}} in rural Southwest Virginia—"in a little town called McClure {{at a place called}} Big Spraddle, just up the holler" [...] from where he moved in 1936 and lived ever since in Dickenson County. The son of Lee and Lucy Stanley, Ralph did not grow up around a lot of music in his home. [...] As he says, his [...] "daddy didn't play an instrument, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> sing church music. [...] And I'd hear him sing songs like 'Man of Constant Sorrow,' 'Pretty Polly' and 'Omie Wise.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Now, when he {{came home}} in this case, if his wife did but speak a word to him, about where he had been, and why he had so abused himself, though her words were spoken in never so much meekness and love, then she was Whore, {76a} and Bitch, and Jade; and 'twas well if she miss'd his fingers and heels. <b>Sometimes</b> also <b>he</b> <b>would</b> bring his Puncks home to his house, and wo be to his wife when they were gone, if she did not {{entertain}} them with all varieties possible, and also carry it lovingly to them.|$|R
6000|$|For <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> like Cerberus <b>would</b> seem-- [...] "Three gentlemen at once"[541] (as sagely says [...] Good Mrs. Malaprop); {{then you}} might deem [...] That he was not even one; now many rays [...] Were {{flashing}} round him; and now a thick steam [...] Hid him from sight--like fogs on London days: [...] Now Burke, now Tooke, he grew to people's fancies [...] And certes often like Sir Philip Francis.|$|R
60|$|To {{these things}} {{they gave him}} no answer; only they looked upon each other, and laughed. Then I saw that they went on all, save that Christian kept before, who had no more talk but with himself, and {{sometimes}} sighingly, and <b>sometimes</b> comfortably; also <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be often reading in the roll {{that one of the}} Shining Ones gave him, by which he was refreshed.|$|R
2500|$|.....a strange madness {{came upon}} him. He crept away and {{fled to the}} woods, unwilling that any should see his going. Into the forest he went, glad to lie hidden beneath the ash trees. He watched the wild creatures grazing on the pasture of the glades. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> follow them, {{sometimes}} pass them in his course. He made use of the roots of plants and of grasses, of fruit from trees and of the blackberries in the thicket. He became a Man of the Woods, as if dedicated to the woods. So for a whole summer he stayed hidden in the woods, discovered by none, forgetful of himself and of his own, lurking like a wild thing.|$|E
2500|$|Former Yankee {{third baseman}} Scott Brosius was notorious for not {{responding}} {{immediately to the}} roll call, as other players on the diamond would. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> even wait {{as long as a}} minute to respond, getting a kick out of the persistence of the Creatures. In Hideki Matsui's first game at the Stadium in 2003, the chant of [...] "MAT-SU-I!" [...] went on for approximately two minutes, because {{he did not know what}} was going on or how to react. In a 2009 press conference, former Yankees first baseman Jason Giambi said that [...] "The biggest thing I miss is (the Bleacher Creatures') roll call. There's no doubt about it, it's the best thing in baseball." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rameau pursued his {{activities}} as a theorist and composer until his death. He {{lived with his}} wife and two of his children in his large suite of rooms in Rue des Bons-Enfants, which he would leave every day, lost in thought, to take a solitary walk in the nearby gardens of the Palais-Royal or the Tuileries. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> meet the young writer Chabanon, who noted some of Rameau's disillusioned confidential remarks: [...] "Day by day, I'm acquiring more good taste, but I no longer have any genius" [...] and [...] "The imagination is worn out in my old head; it's not wise at this age wanting to practise arts that are nothing but imagination." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{the reason}} and {{strength}} of this witness will lie here, that God will by the variety and crossness that their thoughts had one to another, and by the contradiction that was in them, prove them sinners and ungodly; because that, I say, sometimes they {{thought there was a}} God, sometimes again, they thought there was none. Sometimes they thought, that he was such a God, and sometimes again, they thought of him quite contrary; <b>sometimes</b> they thought <b>he</b> was worth regarding, and <b>sometimes</b> they thought <b>he</b> was not; as also, <b>sometimes</b> they thought <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be faithful, both to mercy, and justice, and sinners; and sometimes again, they thought <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not.|$|R
5000|$|One of Mr. Bates' duties was to {{regularly}} {{visit the}} surrounding local unions; {{to assist with}} organizing efforts, [...] "elected official" [...] union training, grievance resolution, and discrimination investigation. He had to drive many miles through many small unfriendly towns; long before the modern interstate highway system {{at the height of}} the Jim Crow era in the United States. He had to drive for extended periods with nowhere to rest, sometimes sleeping in his car because hotels would not allow Negroes to stay in their establishments. When he arrived in a town with no accommodations for Negroes; <b>he</b> <b>would</b> then find a semi friendly Gas Station where <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be allowed to [...] "freshen-up" [...] in a rest room; in order to present a professional appearance to the company management and local union members. <b>Sometimes</b> when <b>he</b> <b>would</b> visit small communities <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be welcomed by local Negro families and Negro churches, who gratefully provide him with a home cooked meal and a place to rest.|$|R
60|$|Isaac {{took part}} in all these pleasures; he entered into every phase of the Indian's life; he hunted, worked, played, danced, and sang with faithfulness. But when the long, dreary winter days came with their ice-laden breezes, {{enforcing}} idleness on the Indians, <b>he</b> became restless. <b>Sometimes</b> for days <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be morose and gloomy, keeping beside his own tent and not mingling with the Indians. At such times Myeerah did not question him.|$|R
