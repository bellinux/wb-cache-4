5|$|Several critics {{detect a}} crisis in public {{memorial}} style from 1945, when the traditional figurative <b>symbolic</b> <b>language,</b> and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to genocide, {{at least on the}} Western side of the Iron Curtain. In the Communist East the established style of Socialist Realism was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities. The generation of abstracted and conceptual war and Holocaust memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally to have found a resolution for these issues.|$|E
5|$|All puzzles {{are based}} on a {{mechanic}} of tracing a path through a maze-like route from a starting point, represented as a circle, to a goal point, represented as a line segment with a rounded end, without crossing one's path. The goal of these puzzles is not always to simply complete the maze but to find the right path that completes the puzzle correctly. Mazes may have several starting points and goals; the player may have to find the right starting point that can complete the maze, or they may {{have to figure out how}} to reach a specific end point to trigger an event in the surrounding environment such as moving a platform. The puzzles include a <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> that denotes the mechanics for that maze. For example, puzzles that present mazes with black and white squares in the spaces between traceable paths require the player to find a path through the maze that separates these squares by color. Other puzzles require the player to use the environment to determine how to solve the puzzle, such as studying a nearby tree with branches that mimic the puzzle, or by observing symbols on nearby floors and walls that align with the puzzle's configuration. The puzzles within each island section {{are based on}} common mechanic, often with a sequence of puzzles appearing early in each section that are designed to help the player identify and understand the mechanic and meaning of the symbols. Later puzzles combine two or more different mechanics into the same puzzle using the consistent <b>symbolic</b> <b>language.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{symbolic}} compiler translates {{a program}} to symbolic constraints, automatically reducing model checking and synthesis to constraint solving. We show that new applications of constraint solving require domain-specific encodings that yield the required orders of magnitude improvements in solver efficiency. Unfortunately, these encodings cannot be obtained with today 2 ̆ 7 s symbolic compilation. We introduce <b>symbolic</b> <b>languages</b> that encapsulate domain-specific encodings under abstractions that behave as their non-symbolic counterparts: client code using the abstractions can be tested and debugged on concrete inputs. When client code is symbolically compiled, the resulting constraints use domain-specific encodings. We demonstrate the idea on the first fully symbolic checker of type systems; a program partitioner; and a parallelizer of tree computations. In each of these case studies, <b>symbolic</b> <b>languages</b> improved on classical symbolic compilers by orders of magnitude...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Programming {{autonomous}} robots {{requires a}} language that is able to express both very high-level algorithms as well as low-level control. We are developing a concurrent programming framework, which is able to handle both complex, high-level algorithms and very low-level hardware control in the same language. In order to illustrate these features we shall describe briefly the approach to implementing one high-level algorithm, which is constraint solving. As an example of low-level programming, we shall outline how behaviours can be programmed using the same programming concepts. We assume familiarity with <b>symbolic</b> <b>languages</b> such as Lisp, Prolog, the Behavior Language, and some acquaintance with constraint solving. 2 The basic programming framework The basic programming language we use, Real-Time Fleng, is a concurrent programming <b>language</b> derived from <b>symbolic</b> <b>languages</b> such as Lisp, Prolog, and Guarded Horn Clauses.

25|$|Proofs employ logic {{but usually}} include some amount of natural {{language}} which usually admits some ambiguity. In fact, {{the vast majority}} of proofs in written mathematics can be considered as applications of rigorous informal logic. Purely formal proofs, written in <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> instead of natural language, are considered in proof theory. The distinction between formal and informal proofs has led to much examination of current and historical mathematical practice, quasi-empiricism in mathematics, and so-called folk mathematics (in both senses of that term). The philosophy of mathematics is concerned with the role of language and logic in proofs, and mathematics as a language.|$|E

Due to the ambiguous nature of Shakespeare's words, this sonnet can be understood in a variety of ways. A number of scholars have examined Sonnet 125 and come away with different conclusions about its message. The number of characters identified by scholars ranges between two and four depending on how the language throughout this particular sonnet and the entire sonnet cycle is interpreted. As the number of characters fluctuates, the meanings assigned to each action within the sonnet take on new meaning.|$|E
25|$|George Lakoff, a {{professor}} of cognitive linguistics and philosophy, advances the view that metaphors are the usual basis of meaning, not the logic of verbal symbol manipulation. Computers use logic programming to effectively query databases but humans rely on a trained biological neural network.

Choosing the correct metaphor results in enough common understanding to pursue questions such as the meaning of life. Improved knowledge of brain function should result in better treatments producing healthier brains. When combined with more effective training, a sound personal assessment as to the meaning of one’s life should be straightforward.|$|E

25|$|For all its {{usefulness}} in resolving questions regarding infinite sets, naive set theory has some fatal flaws. In particular, it is prey to logical paradoxes {{such as those}} exposed by Russell's paradox. The discovery of these paradoxes revealed that not all sets which {{can be described in}} the language of naive set theory can actually be said to exist without creating a contradiction. The 20th century saw a resolution to these paradoxes {{in the development of the}} various axiomatizations of set theories such as ZFC and NBG in common use today. However, the gap between the very formalized and <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> of these theories and our typical informal use of mathematical language results in various paradoxical situations, as well as the philosophical question of exactly what it is that such formal systems actually propose to be talking about.|$|E
25|$|A {{few years}} after Miró’s 1918 Barcelona solo exhibition, he settled in Paris where he {{finished}} a number of paintings that he had begun on his parents’ summer home and farm in Mont-roig del Camp. One such painting, The Farm, showed a transition to a more individual style of painting and certain nationalistic qualities. Ernest Hemingway, who later purchased the piece, compared the artistic accomplishment to James Joyce’s Ulysses and described it by saying, “It has in it all that you feel about Spain when you are there and all that {{you feel when you}} are away and cannot go there. No one else has been able to paint these two very opposing things.” Miró annually returned to Mont-roig and developed a symbolism and nationalism that would stick with him throughout his career. Two of Miró’s first works classified as Surrealist, Catalan Landscape (The Hunter) and The Tilled Field, employ the <b>symbolic</b> <b>language</b> that was to dominate the art of the next decade.|$|E
