40|$|Quality of an {{authoritative}} topographic reference dataset is important {{since it is}} the basis for many applications. Verification of such data is classified as being part of quality management in this paper. The main topic is the automated verification of the German topographic reference dataset ATKIS using orthorectified IKONOS imagery. The objects from the dataset are compared to an up-todate orthoimage in order to obtain information on their quality. The main objects of interest are roads, built-up and vegetation areas. As it is assumed that most of the objects in the database are correct, the strategy is to use the objects of the ATKIS DLMBasis as a starting point. Automatic image operators being able to detect the objects of interest use prior knowledge from the dataset, such as geometrical information. By this means inconsistencies between the ATKIS objects and the image features can be detected. To organise the verification of the data independently from its capture, a <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>working</b> environment has been installed. In the interactive step the human operator just has to focus on the objects not being accepted in the automatic run. In this paper we introduce the whole system, we then focus on an envisaged extension towards the verification of additional object classes, for example the differentiation between deciduous and coniferous forests or between cropland and grassland. To realise this extension, radiometric as well as structural features are defined. Concepts and examples for the implementation of the extensions are presented. 1.

40|$|A {{modified}} version of the coarticulation model proposed by Cohen and Massaro is described. A <b>semi-automatic</b> minimization technique, <b>working</b> on real cinematic data, acquired by the ELITE opto-electronic system, was used to train the dynamic characteristics of the model. Finally, the model was applied with success to GRETA an Italian talking head and few examples are illustrated to show the naturalness of the resulting animation technique 1. 1...|$|R

A <b>semi-automatic</b> minimization technique, <b>working</b> on real cinematic data, acquired by the ELITE opto-electronic system, was used to train the dynamic characteristics of the model.

50|$|Colibri {{was founded}} in 1928 by Julius Lowenthal, who in the same year, invented the world's first <b>working</b> <b>semi-automatic</b> lighter. In 1935, Colibri {{launched}} the fully automatic ‘Monopol’ lighter, which had an acceleration system. From 1940 to 1945 Colibri produced the ‘Stormgard’ lighter designed for soldiers fighting in World War II. In 1952, Julius Lowenthal's son Jack joined Colibri. Colibri produced a lighter with a visible multiple gas refill and a hydraulic auto-flint system in 1958, and an electric lighter, which they named Molectric in 1967.|$|R
