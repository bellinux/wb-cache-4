5000|$|Both the Ford EXP and the Mercury LN7 had {{a sharply}} <b>sloped</b> <b>windshield,</b> wheel arches with {{prominent}} lips, and wide body side moldings not {{far below the}} top of the wheel well. The biggest difference was the rear fascia. The EXP was a notchback with a lift-up hatch, while the LN7 used a big [...] "bubbleback" [...] back window. The EXP's minimalist grille consisted merely of twin horizontal slats on the sloped front panel (the LN7 had ten). The [...] "bubbleback" [...] appearance was used on the larger Mustang-derived sports coupe for Mercury called the Capri.|$|R

50|$|In the redesign, {{both the}} Aeromax and Louisville gained a wider cab with a <b>sloping</b> <b>windshield.</b> Although Aeromax models {{would lose their}} {{composite}} headlights, it gained a much larger slope to the hood. To aid ergonomics, the Aeromax and Louisville would borrow many interior controls from other Ford vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|The JS1 {{was officially}} {{unveiled}} in September of 1969 at the Salon de l'Auto in Paris. [...] The {{car was a}} two-door fixed-head mid-engined coup√©. The body was designed by Pietro Frua and executed in fibreglass, but Ligier had considerable input into the character of his first car. His requirements that the car be light and compact but with good forward visibility from the cabin resulted in the JS1 having a large cockpit and big <b>sloping</b> <b>windshield.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{design of}} these minivans was controversial. At {{the time that}} the Oldsmobile Silhouette and its {{siblings}} were conceived, no one had tried to market a stylish or sporty minivan, and GM felt that this represented a potentially large market segment. They styled these minivans to be lower and sleeker than the competing brands.

5000|$|The 1932 Series 355B {{was even}} longer and lower, with an entirely restyled front assembly. The roof line was lowered 1 - 3 in. The longer hood now had six hood ports. The new front end styling {{included}} a flat grille {{built into the}} radiator shell, head and side lights of streamlined bullet shape {{and the elimination of}} the fender tie bar and monogram bar. The trumpets of the dual horns projected through the headlight stanchions. The headlight lenses were 9.5 in in diameter. The dual taillights matched the headlights. Super safe lighting featured three filament bulbs and four contour positions for degree and angle of illumination. The front license plate was mounted on the bumper. Runningboards curved to match the sweep of the front fenders and blended into the rear fenders. The tail of the rear fenders blended into the fuel tank valence. The trunk on the town sedan, town coupe and five-passenger convertible coupe was integral with the body. The vision of the driver was improved by 30 percent {{as a result of the}} elimination of the outside visor and the construction of a 12 degree <b>sloping</b> <b>windshield</b> and corner posts. There was a large ventilator on top of the cowl and none on the sides. All separate body moldings were eliminated. A three spoke steering wheel enabled an unobstructed view of the instrument cluster when in the straight ahead position. The right side of the instrument panel was occupied by a [...] "locker." [...] Engine horsepower increased to 115. The deepening Great Depression helped sales plummet to 2,700.|$|E
50|$|The car's radiator-cooling inlet was a low-set oval in a forward-thrusting nose; {{there was}} no obvious forward bumper. The two {{headlights}} were set under transparent fairings. The bonnet was long and markedly <b>sloped.</b> Its <b>windshield</b> was more highly sloped than most contemporary vehicles. An upturned air deflector was mounted atop the rear trunk.|$|R
5000|$|The H-23 Raven {{performed}} as a utility, observation, and MedEvac helicopter during the Korean War. Model numbers ranged A through D, F and G. The H-23A had a <b>sloping</b> front <b>windshield.</b> The H-23B {{was used as}} a primary helicopter trainer. Beginning with the UH-23C, all later models featured the [...] "Goldfish bowl" [...] canopy similar to the Bell 47.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} these minivans {{was that of}} a European Bullet Train which gave it an {{aerodynamic}} and sporty appearance. At the time that the Pontiac Trans Sport and its siblings were conceived, no one had tried to market a stylish or sporty minivan, and GM felt that this represented a potentially large market segment that the class-leading Chrysler minivans failed to address. They styled these minivans to be lower and sleeker than any of the competing brands on the market. The extremely large, long and <b>sloped</b> <b>windshield</b> and the resultant long distance {{to the base of the}} windshield when sitting in the drivers seat made for a disconcerting driving experience until a person could adjust to the [...] "different" [...] proportions. Automotive magazines christened the new minivans [...] "dustbusters" [...] after Black and Decker's trademark for handheld vacuum cleaners, since the minivans shared a similar side profile to the handheld vacuum cleaners. Critics panned the vehicle as one of the ugliest car designs of all time.|$|R
50|$|The CN {{series was}} an in house {{development}} of AD Basov available since 1977. The CN is available with 4x4, 6x6 and 8x8 wheel configurations and 3 to 10 ton cargo capacity. The CN Series feature a rectangular shaped all-metal cab with horizontally grooved doors and side panels, flat front end and a <b>sloping</b> hinged <b>windshield.</b> Vehicles {{are equipped with}} license built MAN D2156 6-cylinder diesel engines and a 5- or 6 -speed transmission, 2-speed transfercase, wheel planetary gear drives, wheels with lockable differentials, dual airbrakes, power steering and a 24-volt electrical devices.|$|R
5000|$|The Series BA {{carried over}} {{much from the}} Series AE and the main {{external}} differences were the <b>sloping</b> of the <b>windshield</b> {{and the removal of}} the external visor above. On either side of the hood the previous louvers were replaced by opening vents, finished in a distinctive chrome on DeLuxe models ...|$|R
5000|$|From 1936 to 1945, PCC {{cars were}} 'Air-Electrics' with {{friction}} brakes, doors, and windshield wipers operated by air pressure. PRCo PCC 1600 of 1945 was the post WW2 All-Electric Demonstrator which eliminated the air compressor and associated piping while incorporating such features as standee windows, a <b>sloped</b> <b>windshield</b> to eliminate night time glare, redesigned back end, forced-air ventilation, and other features. Dynamic brakes were the service brake on all PCCs; when almost stopped, friction brakes completed the stop {{and held the}} car in [...] "park". Dynamic brakes slowed the [...] "Air" [...] cars to 3.0-mph at which point a lock-out relay allowed automatic application of air-applied friction brakes against {{each of the eight}} wheels. On All-Electric cars the dynamics were effective to 0.75-mph where the lockout relay then allowed a spring applied friction brake to engage a drum on each of the four motor drive shafts; this completed the stop and held the car in park. Drum brakes were released by an electric solenoid operating from low-voltage battery power; a power failure would prevent the drums from releasing which would prevent power application, a fail-safe feature. Drum brakes were quite popular and greatly reduced maintenance thus some [...] "Air" [...] cars were retrofitted with drums. Four magnetic brakes, one between the wheels on each side of each truck, applied additional braking for emergency stopping where all brakes were generally employed.|$|R

25|$|For 1932, the Greater Eights {{received}} new, more streamlined styling, {{including a}} greater <b>slope</b> of the <b>windshield.</b> Hudson's engineering stylist, Frank S. Spring, made the fenders more graceful {{and gave the}} car's body gentler curves. The 1932 models featured a prominent Vee'd grille with vertical chrome theme. The cars were recognizable by their uniquely styled rounded-triangle shaped headlights and parking lights, which mimicked the shape of Hudson's triangle logo. The triangle theme was also repeated in the interior, including the driver's floor pedals.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with its}} role in aerodynamics, the larger {{windshield}} {{played a role in}} safety by minimizing blind spots. Due to the <b>slope</b> of the <b>windshield,</b> Thomas moved the entry door further back, adding a large window ahead of the main entry door to improve visibility around the loading zone (similar to the Thomas Vista and nearly all small school buses). Along with a taller body, the passenger windows were enlarged compared to other Thomas buses. Additionally, the C2 has larger emergency exits compared to the FS-65 and the Thomas Saf-T-Liner Type D buses.|$|R
50|$|While {{fuel economy}} {{had played a}} key role in the demise of the Carousel, it would become a major factor behind the design of the Aerostar. In place of the {{full-size}} van platform, the Aerostar shared many components with the Ford Ranger light pickup truck. Foregoing the previous two-box design, in a design similar to the European Ford Transit, the Aerostar used a one-box design with the hood and <b>windshield</b> <b>sloped</b> at a similar angle. After the 1997 model year, the Aerostar was discontinued; Ford had largely replaced by 1995 with the Ford Windstar and the Mercury Villager (the latter built in a joint venture with Nissan). The Windstar would largely follow the design set in place by Chrysler, adopting front-wheel drive and unit-body construction based on a car platform.|$|R
5000|$|The 1934 Series 370D was restyled {{yet again}} {{but this time}} was mounted on a {{completely}} new chassis. The radiator grill slanted rearward with a central bar and five horizontal sections, the <b>windshield</b> <b>sloped</b> even more rearward, headlights were enclosed in new teardrop housings mounted on streamlined supports, the horns joined the radiator cap under the hood, the spare tire was concealed under a new beaver tail deck on most models and the whole car sat approximately 2 in lower. Significant mechanical advancements included dual X-frame chassis construction, [...] "Knee-Action" [...] front coil spring suspension that greatly reduced unsprung weight and Hotchkiss steering. The 1935 Series 370E saw {{the addition of the}} Fisher Turret Top on Fisher bodied cars and an increase in horsepower to 150. Sales over the two years combined totaled only 1098.|$|R
50|$|The Firebird and Camaro were {{completely}} redesigned for the 1982 model year, with the <b>windshield</b> <b>slope</b> set at 62 degrees, (about three degrees steeper than anything GM had ever tried before), {{and for the}} first time, a large, glass-dominated hatchback that required no metal structure to support it. Two concealed pop-up headlights, a first on the F-Body cars, were the primary characteristic that distinguished the third generation Firebird from both its Camaro sibling and its prior form (a styling characteristic carried into the fourth generation's design). In addition to being about 500 lb lighter than the previous design, the new design was the most aerodynamic product GM had ever released. Wind tunnels were used to form the new F-Body platform's shape, and Pontiac took full advantage of it. The aerodynamic developments extended to the finned aluminum wheels with smooth hubcaps and a functional rear spoiler.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} the car has been changed to a more {{conservative}} appearance. The [...] "fluidic sculpture" [...] design that persisted across the Hyundai portfolio since 2011 is gone in the sixth generation Elantra. The car is now more like a fastback with its roofline <b>sloped</b> from the <b>windshield</b> {{to the rear of}} the car and it has less curves overall with pentagonal head and tail lights, a hexagonal grille, and redesigned body panels and bumper emphasizing straight lines along the body. The windshield is drawn back from the hood further than the prior generation, making for a more traditional sedan look. The interior is also less curved, with a cockpit, audio/temp controls and glove compartment in a single bow line across the dash. This was done without reducing the interior cabin space of the prior generation at 110.2 cubic feet (while the Elantra is sold under the compact class, it classifies as a mid-size sedan according to the EPA.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The 3rd Generation of Firebirds {{consisted}} of three models: Firebird, Firebird S/E, and Firebird Trans Am. The Firebird was the base model, equivalent to the Camaro Sport Coupe; the Firebird S/E was the luxury version; and the Trans Am, the high-performance version. For 1982, the new Firebird and Camaro had been completely restyled, with the <b>windshield</b> <b>slope</b> set at a dramatic, more aerodynamic 62 degrees, (about 3 degrees steeper than anything GM had ever tried before), flush mounted side glass, {{and for the first}} time, a large, glass-dominated rear hatchback. Electronically controlled retractable headlamps, and a rounded hoodline and front fenders were the primary characteristics that distinguished the Firebird from its Camaro sibling and its previous Firebird incarnations. The Firebird would retain hidden headlamps until the end of all production in 2002. Pontiac had also hoped to drop the [...] "Trans Am" [...] moniker from the redesigned cars to save royalties paid to the SCCA for use of the name. Early promotional cars were marked [...] "T/A" [...] as an alternative, however it was decided that doing so might cause more problems than it was worth and the [...] "Trans Am" [...] nameplate remained. Still, with its dimensions reduced, wheelbase shortened, and weight reduced, the Third Generation Firebird was also the closest yet in size to the original 1967 model. It won [...] "Best Sports GT" [...] category in the $11,000 to $14,000 range (also along with the Camaro). Road & Track called the fuel-injected Trans Am [...] "a dramatic improvement on its predecessors," [...] accelerating from 0-60 in 9.2 seconds.|$|R
