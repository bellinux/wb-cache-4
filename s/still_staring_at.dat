60|$|Ernest, never speaking, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> Fanny, gets clumsily out again.|$|E
60|$|He was <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> {{the plastic}} bag when the room outside vanished.|$|E
60|$|The {{official}} was <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the body. He {{was a man}} of slow apprehension.|$|E
60|$|The Demon {{sank into}} a chair, nerveless and limp, but <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> fearfully <b>at</b> the boy.|$|R
60|$|He {{left the}} room, and walked dreamily {{back to the}} Postage Department, leaving the manager <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> glassily <b>at</b> nothing.|$|R
60|$|Evan was <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> back curiously <b>at</b> the beaming and bearded {{creature}} behind him.|$|R
60|$|Gregory put {{the pistol}} slowly down, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> Syme {{as if he}} were a sea-monster.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I--er--this is most extraordinary!" [...] ejaculated the man, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> {{the country}} youth. [...] "I don't {{understand}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|He paused, then continued, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> {{the sinking}} sun, which made his remarks about us, whom {{he did not}} seem to see, uncanny-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} tell you," [...] {{continued}} MacIan, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> stolidly <b>at</b> the other, [...] "that {{you are a}} great chief, and {{it is good to}} go to war behind you." ...|$|R
60|$|Zack {{pulled out}} his handkerchief, and stifled his {{laughter}} {{as well as he}} could, out of consideration for Mat, who, however, took not the smallest notice of him, but added, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> intently <b>at</b> the picture.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, sir," [...] {{said the}} old clerk, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> fixedly <b>at</b> Otter, whose aspect {{appeared}} to fascinate {{him as much as}} that worthy had been fascinated by the eyes of the Water-Dweller. [...] "Have you an appointment, sir?" ...|$|R
60|$|Sam got a pinch on the {{arm from}} 'is pal that nearly made him scream, then they both stood <b>still,</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the docker.|$|E
60|$|Then, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> them {{as though}} they held his eyes in their hearts, Rames departed, and the captain led them to their lodging.|$|E
60|$|She was {{standing}} stock <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the pastry she was making. She turned to me, {{and there was}} a curious smile about her lips.|$|E
60|$|The lad stood quite <b>still</b> {{a moment}} <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him, and Winston {{returning}} his gaze steadily felt his pulses throb.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{gave him}} his ticket, and for five minutes more I was kept pretty busy, when up came the train; in got the {{struggling}} crowd; whew! went the whistle, and away went the whole affair, leaving {{no one on the}} platform but the porter, and the old woman <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> the sky.|$|R
6000|$|She stood quite <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> blankly <b>at</b> this unmanageable situation. He was {{the first}} to break silence. He lifted one hand and dropped it again with a dead impact on the arm of his chair. [...] "I got the things," [...] he said, [...] "and there they are. Anyhow,--they got to be run in a proper way." ...|$|R
60|$|Phil elevates his one eyebrow, {{and after}} respectfully {{staring at his}} master to express interest, {{swallows}} a great gulp of coffee, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|... "My pleasure? Oh, God, my pleasure?" [...] exclaimed Rosamund in {{the same}} drear voice, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> her father, who lay before her on the ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Will!" [...] {{she called}} out and arose. Then {{she looked at the}} man. [...] "Can it be possible? Pierre!" [...] And she stood <b>still,</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> her relative.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Augusta," [...] I answered, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> out <b>at</b> the sea. [...] "In {{the prison}} yonder {{is an old}} bishop named Barnabas of Egypt, who was set upon by other bishops at the Council while you were away and wellnigh beaten to death. I ask {{that he may be}} freed and {{restored}} to his diocese with honour." ...|$|R
60|$|This was {{not merely}} {{the work of an}} aroused imagination, but had {{something}} sensible to go upon; sounds of a stealthy approach were no doubt audible; and while he <b>still</b> stood <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the lumber, the voice of his host sounded suddenly, and with even more than the customary softness of enunciation, from behind.|$|R
6000|$|The Expressman's {{face was}} turned anxiously towards Bill, who, after a hurried gulp of his {{remaining}} liquor, <b>still</b> stood <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the window. Then he slowly drew {{on one of}} his large gloves. [...] "Ye didn't," [...] he said, with a slow, drawling, but perfectly distinct, articulation, [...] "happen to know old 'Skinner' Hemmings when you were over there?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{mother and}} the little one obeyed. He caught them {{in his arms and}} set them down. The girl sat <b>still,</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him with reproachful, with disdainful eyes.|$|E
60|$|When the CÃ¦sar had {{finished}} speaking, {{and he fell}} swooning back {{in the arms of}} the praefect of Rome, the conspirators remained quite <b>still,</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> one another, dumbfounded.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll bet!" [...] he exclaimed, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the photo. [...] "A lady, is she? An' {{how much}} does she reckon ter keep up this sort o' game on?" ...|$|E
60|$|They tested {{him with}} as many tongues as they could muster among them, but were {{compelled}} at last to give the matter over and to leave their silent patient, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> up wild-eyed <b>at</b> the whitewashed hospital ceiling.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} Alleyne {{stood in the}} window, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> down <b>at</b> the silent forest, {{uncertain}} as to what he should think of these midnight walkers. Then he bethought him that there was one beside him who was fitter to judge on such a matter. His fingers had scarce rested upon Aylward's shoulder ere the bowman was on his feet, with his hand outstretched to his sword.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{from without}} came a shrill call {{and the sound}} of rapid footsteps. Ellen leaned against the wall, <b>staring</b> <b>still</b> <b>at</b> Colter. [...] "Hey, Jim--what's the shootin'?" [...] called Springer, breathlessly.|$|R
60|$|He {{remained}} perfectly <b>still,</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> {{the immense}} and ruddy moon, {{the only thing}} in the far-reaching darkness of the level. His heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.|$|E
60|$|His {{excellency}} changed colour. He sat quite <b>still,</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> {{the negro}} a moment, conscious that his pulses were drumming {{in a manner}} wholly unusual to them. Then quietly he assented.|$|E
60|$|For a {{while the}} ever-gathering crowd of their assailants {{remained}} <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> them. Then the leaders began to whisper to each other, for they scarcely seemed to dare to talk aloud.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Chloe--I mean aunt Dinah--do take Eunice--I mean Victorine and Una--away, and--you know--tidy them; and you, Sarah--it's Sarah, isn't it?--lay some {{refreshment}} in {{the parlor}} for this gentleman. And, Bob, tell your sister Cynthia to come here with Eunice." [...] As Bob <b>still</b> remained <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Bowers, she added, in weary explanation, [...] "Mr. Bowers brought me over from the Summit woods in his buggy--it was so hot. There--shake hands and thank him, and run away--do!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{began to}} {{understand}} as I listened to him that my friends in England {{had not been so}} far wrong when they had declared that as long as he lived--this little thirty-six year old artilleryman--there could not possibly be any peace in the world. He drank some coffee which Constant had placed upon the small round table at his elbow. Then {{he leaned back in his}} chair once more, <b>still</b> <b>staring</b> moodily <b>at</b> the red glow of the fire, with his chin sunk upon his chest.|$|R
60|$|Then {{all at once}} {{a strange}} thing happened. The scowl went right off his face and the anger out of his eyes. He looked astonished, and then foolish. I saw the color {{creeping}} up into his cheeks. As for me, I <b>still</b> stood there <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him, not able to say a single word.|$|R
