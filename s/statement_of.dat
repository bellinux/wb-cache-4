5|$|This is a concise work, {{in terms}} of its duration, the economy of {{thematic}} material presented, and also the narrow registers within which the four parts operate. The first movement is in 6/8 time and a monothematic sonata form. The development and recapitulation sections feature an example of Haydn's musical jokes. In this case he tinkers with the movement's sonata form by reference to an historical variation of it. The recapitulation starts only with a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> the second phrase of the movement's theme, which is in the dominant. This would have been a common technique earlier in the eighteenth century that, in this instance, is liable to confuse the unknowing listener looking for the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> the first phrase of the theme in the tonic. It is not until 27 measures later that the listener is presented with a more emphatic reprise, which is actually a coda. The coda involves the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> the main theme in the tonic that the listener might have been expecting, and it does so after two measures of pointed silence.|$|E
