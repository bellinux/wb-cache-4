50|$|The {{first race}} start ended quickly after the Zakspeed of Martin Brundle crashed, {{then the two}} Tyrrells of Jonathan Palmer and Philippe Streiff {{collided}} in the ensuing chaos with Piercarlo Ghinzani also crashing his Ligier. The second attempt to start was more serious. Mansell on the front row crawled away with clutch problems and the grid compacted behind him. The Österreichring's narrow front <b>straight</b> <b>saw</b> to the rest when Eddie Cheever (Arrows) and Riccardo Patrese (Brabham) collided and half the grid, including Johansson, Alex Caffi (Osella), Ivan Capelli (March), Pascal Fabre, Philippe Alliot (Larrousse-Lola), and both Zakspeeds of Brundle and Christian Danner {{were involved in the}} ensuing pile-up.|$|E
50|$|Still {{driving the}} Slick 50 Mazda, McLeod {{finished}} third in the 1984 Australian Touring Car Championship behind the Holden Dealer Team Commodore of Peter Brock, and series winner Dick Johnson in his Greens-Tuf Ford Falcon. McLeod went into the final round at Adelaide in 2nd position, 22 points in front of Brock, and needed to only finish 14th to claim 2nd regardless of where Brock finished. Unfortunately a clash with the BMW of Jim Richards on lap 4 at the end of AIR's 900 metre long front <b>straight</b> <b>saw</b> the Mazda with enough damage to have McLoeod limp back to the pits and retire, and with Brock finishing the race 2nd behind Allan Grice and gaining 23 points, he moved to 95 points, 1 point in front of McLeod. 1984 was actually the only full ATCC that McLeod ever contested. His best finishes in the series were back to back 2nd places in rounds 4 and 5 at Surfers Paradise behind Johnson and Oran Park behind the RX-7 of 1979 ATCC champion Bob Morris. These would also prove to be the highest placings McLeod achieved in 25 ATCC rounds competed in between 1981 and 1988.|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study of}} how the {{selection}} of raw material and sawing methods affects the magnitude of bow, spring and twist {{as well as the}} yield of accepted wall studs when graded with respect to straightness. The focus was on the relation between compression wood in butt logs of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) and the straightness of wall studs, in order to improve the sawmills ability to satisfy the customer demands by <b>straighter</b> <b>sawn</b> products. The following aspects of compression wood in the production process were examined:Godkänd; 2001; 20070613 (margjo...|$|R
50|$|In , the FIA {{increased}} the number of DRS zones to two on some circuits featuring multiple long straights. In Valencia and in Montreal, two zones were endorsed on consecutive long straights, whilst in Monza and in Buddh, two zones were created on separate parts of the circuit. Two zones had originally been planned for every race with multiple long straights from Montreal onwards (depending on Montreal/Valencia success), but this was not implemented. However, at the penultimate round of the 2011 season, two zones on consecutive long <b>straights</b> <b>saw</b> a return at Yas Marina.|$|R

40|$|The {{amount of}} the {{external}} impulse exerted on the object being sawn has been treated one of important control parameters. At the same time, the internal impulses experienced in the joints {{should be taken into}} account to avoid serious damage or injury at the joints of robot. This paper discusses the impulse models in a <b>straight</b> <b>sawing</b> task. And, a motion planning algorithm is proposed, which employs the external and internal impulses as performance indices. For this, the gradient projection method is employed to exploit the kinematic redundancy of the robot structure. Finally, through both simulation and experimentation for the sawing task, the effectiveness of the proposed motion planning algorithm could be verified...|$|R

40|$|Attachment for {{reciprocating}} power-saw maintains nearly constant {{cutting pressure}} even though kerf length varies. Attachment developed for wire saws used to slice cylindrical silicon ingots into wafers for semiconductor devices.

40|$|A {{timber shell}} {{structure}} {{is designed to}} provide covering for an outdoor auditorium in Madrid (Spain). The covering comprises five independent overlapped marquees with similar shape but diverse dimensions. The surface geometry of each marquee is defined by a hyperbolic paraboloid, with its boundaries delimited by elliptical curves in horizontal projection. Structural section for the timber shell is a composite section with several staggered layers of <b>straight</b> <b>sawn</b> timber planks, arranged in two orthogonal directions following the straight skew lines of the hyperbolic paraboloid. Over them two continuous top layers are arranged which provides bracing for the structure and support for the waterproofing material. Each layer is laid over the previous one, bolted and glued with polyurethane adhesive. Special characteristics of the design analysis and detailed erection process are described. The designed solution provides lightweight roofing with a powerful and original image, short construction time and reasonable budget...|$|R
25|$|After being {{appointed}} player-manager, Sinclair {{helped save}} Colwyn Bay from relegation. Despite being nine points from safety with {{two weeks of}} the season remaining, a run of six <b>straight</b> wins <b>saw</b> the Seagulls stay up with five points to spare. Sinclair led Colwyn Bay to twelfth place in the Conference North in his first full season in charge, winning 14 matches.|$|R
40|$|When <b>straight</b> <b>sawing</b> {{technology}} is used, yields from irregularly-shaped (swept) logs {{are lower than}} those from comparable unswept logs. The greater the sweep, the greater the anticipated yield loss. Developments in curve-sawing technology may improve yields from swept logs; volume increases of 3 %- 20 %, and board length increases exceeding 20 % have been suggested. The destructive nature of the sawing process precludes direct verification of such claims. A method has been developed to allow simulation of conceptual curve-sawing using a straight-sawing simulation system. Curve-fitting and data transformation are used to remodel a swept log as its "straightened " counterpart. This "log metamorphosis " was applied {{to a sample of}} 40 log models constructed from measurements of actual logs and selected to cover a range in size, shape, and quality. Sawing simulations were performed before and after log metamorphosis in order to compare straight- and curve-sawn yield. Results were variable, but increases in estimated recoveries fell within the assumed ranges reported for actual curve-sawing...|$|R

50|$|Liverpool's {{dreams of}} European glory were ended on 8 December 1998 when they {{suffered}} a hefty defeat to Celta Vigo in the UEFA Cup third round. The Reds had stuttered {{in the league}} early in the month and a 1-0 defeat at Wimbledon on 13 December saw them occupy 12th place in the league. However, three <b>straight</b> wins <b>saw</b> them rise to seventh {{by the end of}} the year.|$|R

50|$|He fought out of Miyagino {{stable and}} made his debut in the jonokuchi {{division}} in May 1903. He reached the top division in January 1909 and won his first tournament championship in his debut tournament at ōzeki rank in January 1913. He was undefeated in that tournament, recording seven wins, one draw and one no decision. His second championship in January 1915, which he took with ten <b>straight</b> wins, <b>saw</b> him promoted to yokozuna.|$|R
50|$|In 1981, {{he joined}} the {{coaching}} staff at Blackpool and in July 1982 moved to be a coach at Newport County. He was appointed manager of Newport in June 1985, and kept the club rooted to 18th in the Third Division in 1985-86, before a run of seven <b>straight</b> defeats <b>saw</b> the club hovering above the relegation places and ultimately cost him his job. His replacement John Relish managed to steer the club to safety.|$|R

30|$|More recently, Langenbeck {{described}} performing planned open osteotomies {{based on}} his experience in the Schleswig–Holstein war (1848 – 1850) [9, 10]. He used a <b>straight</b> pointed <b>saw</b> to debride dead bone from bullet wounds. Unfortunately, infection rates were high as there was {{little in the way}} of asepsis and large open approaches were used. Towards the latter part of the nineteenth century, surgeons began to develop instruments that allowed them to perform what became known as ‘subcutaneous osteotomy’ [10]. This yielded markedly lower complication rates.|$|R
5000|$|The car {{proved to}} be fast, and Mansell took it to victory in its début race in Brazil, despite fears of {{unreliability}} (the potential of the new car, with its innovative aerodynamics, gearbox and V12 engine was clear - Mansell declared {{on the eve of}} the Brazilian race that if [...] "the car had even half the horsepower it sounds like it has, we'll win every race this year..."). However, it did not record another finish until the French Grand Prix, and there were to be no races in which both drivers finished. But when the car did finish, it did so in a position no lower than third, with Mansell taking second in both France and his home race at Silverstone, third in Germany where the long <b>straights</b> <b>saw</b> the Ferrari V12 almost breathless against the more powerful Honda V10s (though they still had the advantage over the Renault V10s of Williams and the Ford V8 powered Benettons), a second win in Hungary which was highlighted by his passing move on Senna to take the lead, and finally third at Spa, before Berger finished second at Monza, won in Portugal - a race where the Ferraris were clearly more competitive than the championship-winning McLarens - and finished second again in Spain.|$|R

50|$|During the {{television}} {{coverage of the}} qualifying session of the 2002 German Grand Prix held on the new circuit, former F1 driver and current lead TV commentator for Sky Sports Formula One coverage Martin Brundle stated that he, along with other drivers of his era (mid-1980s to the mid-1990s), did not particularly enjoy racing at the old Hockenheim as the long <b>straights</b> often <b>saw</b> only seven or eight finishers from twenty-six starters, with most dropping out through engine or transmission failure caused by the long periods at high speed on the forest straights.|$|R
50|$|In the 2001 UEFA Intertoto Cup, {{which started}} for Basel {{on the first}} of July, Basel were drawn against Iceland's Grindavík. With two {{victories}} Basel won 5-0 on aggregate.

50|$|The year began poorly for the Saints {{with three}} {{consecutive}} losses {{away from home}} in which the side conceded 11 goals, prompting Dodgin to replace regular goalkeeper George Ephgrave with Len Stansbridge {{for much of the}} rest of the season. Through February and March, the team won four out of seven matches to move away from the relegation zone and back up to the top ten, although four <b>straight</b> losses <b>saw</b> them drop back down to 15th in April. Seven players were released by the club near the end of the month. Three wins from their last six matches meant that Southampton finished 14th in the Second Division table, compared to 18th in the last pre-war season.|$|R
