40|$|The {{decoupling}} {{of direct}} payments, {{caused by the}} introduction of the Single Payment Scheme (SPS), has generated an incentive for farmers to decrease the production of cereals, oilseeds and protein crops (COP) and (because of the reform of sugar CMO) sugar beet. In some cases, this has also provided a strong enough incentive for farmers to let some of the available land uncultivated in the years immediately following the introduction of the SPS. However, in the last few years, cereal prices have sharply increased under the pressure of a growing world demand. Under this situation, the EU Commission has abrogated the <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>requirement</b> allowing the cultivation on idle land. In this way the Commission intends to allow EU farmers {{to take advantage of the}} new market conditions and to stabilise cereal market. This paper aims at assessing how much the abrogation of <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>requirement</b> can be effective in increasing cereal production. This is not a trivial question given that in some farms the introduction of SPS has also resulted in some of the land previously cultivated (i. e. not set aside) to be left uncultivated. Under this circumstance, the set aside constraint could be not binding and, therefore, its abrogation may not result in an increase of production. The second aim of the paper is to evaluate to what extent increases of cereal prices could foster cereal production and reduce the amount of uncultivated land. The analysis has been carried out on a sample of FADN farms of three study areas located in two regions of Italy (Emilia Romagna and Veneto) using Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) models. The analysis has shown that the decoupling of direct payments generates a not negligible decrease of COP production and pushes some farmers to let a limited amount of land uncultivated. Therefore, the abrogation of <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>requirement</b> per-se increases cereal production, but this increase is not in all cases very relevant. The increases of cereal prices could be more effective than the abrogation of <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>requirement</b> in increasing cereal production. The combination of both considered factors is expected to revert the decline of cereal production experienced in the considered farms after the introduction of the SPS even if the magnitude of this effect is strongly affected by the level of cereal prices.

Over time a number of laws, regulations and guidance have been put in place to direct the actions of the Government as it interacts with the private sector in this country. As a result of our political process and the method in which laws are created, some of these requirements have conflicted with other guidance already in place within the Federal acquisition process. Several examples are present throughout our history, and in current regulations, to illustrate these forces that the contracting officer must manage. One example is the balancing act required between full and open competition, under Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) and the direction given by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>requirements</b> for different types of small disadvantaged businesses. However, through innovative strategies, the creative contracting officer can balance these requirements while providing the best value for the Government.

40|$|In {{this report}} microeconometric methods {{are applied to}} explain the {{voluntary}} <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> of arable land of Austrian farms. The descriptive {{analysis of the data}} shows {{that the majority of the}} small scale farms do not <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> arable land. But if they do <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> land, they <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> substantial shares. The microeconometric estimations confirm that the decision to <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> consists of two steps. The first step is whether to <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> at all and the second step is how much to <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b> The type of a farm has the biggest effect on the decision. Soil quality, the distribution of the soil quality, off farm work and the participation in the ÖPUL-program have significant, but generally small, influence as well. The results vary somewhat for different major production areas. If the two step model is used to calculate the expected <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> of a farm, it generally is low as farms have low probabilities to <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b> Most of the farms under the general regulation <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> small shares of arable land. That is due to the fact that every <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> that is more than the mandatory 10 percent is defined a voluntary <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b> Therefore, unfortunately, the statistical estimations are almost impossible to render and hence <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> is not as well explained by the model for farms under the general regulation as for the small scale farms. The main conclusion of the research is that there were no factors that lead to massive <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b> This can be interpreted as a sign that cultivating arable land generally still pays in Austria. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{grows out}} of a critical assessment of mainstream literature on {{the political economy of}} reforms. The author has questioned the logic of the influential argument that authoritarian or single party regimes are more successful in achieving rapid shifts in economic strategy, and successful economic restructuring because they are able to insulate technocratic policy-makers from the popular sectors which bear the greatest losses in the short-term from policies like privatization, reductions in subsidies and reduced expenditures on social welfare. The research asserts that authoritarian and quasi-authoritarian regimes, which did not have to answer to public opinion in bending to international pressures, were most willing to adopt export-oriented policies, and became the greatest beneficiaries of international financial support that helped ensure success during the transition period. As the trend toward democratization proceeds, it is no longer realistic to advance models of economic restructuring that <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> pressing <b>requirements</b> to build political consensus and popular support for economic reforms. It is in this context the current study looks at India 2 ̆ 7 s experience as a democracy, with a prolonged trajectory of economic reforms reaching back to the late 1960 s, as a critical case for assessing the impact of international linkages. It explores the historical relationship between the Government of India (GOI) and its international linkages as a successful model for the ways in which a developing country can learn to work with and through multilateral organizations to promote economic and political development while sustaining democratic institutions and relative political autonomy in international affairs. The evolution of policies since the 1960 s reflects a special type of gradualism where deliberate choices were made to approach it over an extended time period to ease the transition. This is explained through the development of the concept of “homegrown conditionality”. These arguments have important implications for democratic developing countries seeking to maintain ownership of their economic reform packages and development programs. ...|$|R

40|$|The GAEC {{standard}} Management of <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> {{is applied}} to arable lands subjected to <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> and kept non-cultivated throughout the year. The standard is also applied to other <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> areas eligible for direct payments. For the implementation of this Standard, the farmer must assure the presence of natural or artificial green cover on the surface throughout the year and adopt consistent agronomic practices as mowing, or other equivalent, {{in order to maintain}} the normal state of soil fertility, protect wildlife, prevent the formation of a potential inoculum of fires, especially during drought and prevent the spread of weeds. Up to the CAP Health Check the legislation on the <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> required the farmer to plough the soil by mid-May. Therefore, the natural vegetation cover could neither establish nor express its value against erosion throughout the year. Since mid 2004, cross compliance has banned ploughing of <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> surfaces. This novelty is very important in relation to the effectiveness of the standard in erosion control. In Italy there are only few studies carried out in the field that have measured the effect of <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> on soil erosion. The few existing experiments regarded the effect of <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> managed in accordance with the CAP dictates prior to the CAP Health Check. The results of case studies show very contrasting results regarding soil erosion on <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> plots managed through the annual ploughing in the period in which this rule remained in force. This finding can be explained by considering that most of soil erosion in the Mediterranean environment is determined by extreme events; so, <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> resulted ineffective in protecting the soil, when very erosive events occurred on bare soil (soil in seed bed condition after ploughing and harrowing) or when the plant cover of soil was still scarce. In these conditions soil erosion rate resulted similar to that observed in the intensive cropping systems. On the contrary, for events occurred when the natural vegetation was sufficiently developed, the beneficial effect of <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> in limiting erosion was similar to that exerted by total grass cover. In general, it can be argued that on plough <b>set</b> <b>aside,</b> an average period of 2 months is needed for the establishment of natural cover sufficient enough to ensure a significant protection of soil from erosion. The results show that in Italy <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> before the CAP Health Check might have determined a decrease of soil erosion by 50 % (on average). Since 2005, <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> under cross compliance regime appears to have had a greater beneficial effect than before in reducing erosion, as total grass cover was able to decrease soil loss by 98 % compared to intensive farming systems...|$|R

40|$|Negative {{consequences}} of intensive forest management on biodiversity are often mitigated by <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> old forest, but alternative strategies have been suggested. We have compared using simulations the {{consequences of}} two of these alternatives − <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> young forests or extending rotation periods − to that of current practice in managed boreal forest. In all scenarios we applied a constant conservation budget and predicted forest development and harvesting over 200 years. As a proxy for biodiversity conservation, we projected the extinction risk of a dead wood-dependent beetle, Diacanthous undulatus, in a 50 km 2 landscape in central Sweden, using a colonization-extinction model. During the first century, <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> young forest stands rather than old stands increased extinction risk because young stands have lower habitat quality. However, habitat quality of young forests increased as they aged and they were much cheaper to <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> than old stands. Therefore, the strategy allowed a larger set-aside area (within the budget constraint), resulting in lower extinction risk and harvested timber volumes in the second century. Prolonging rotations also decreased the extinction risk but was in the long-term less cost-effective. The most cost-effective strategy in the long-term (200 years) was to <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> a mixture of old and young forest. However, <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> young stands rather than prolonging rotations or <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> old stands delays both the benefits (lower extinction risk) and costs (lost harvest volumes), so the optimal strategy depends on the assumed societal values and hence discount rates...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{sustainable}} forest management and biodiversity conservation has {{become more and more}} important in the last decades. The preservation of key habitats and ecologically valuable forests is recognized to be a goal in the planning process. Forest certification is a tool used to implement and achieve this objective. In Sweden the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification imposes to the forest owners who want to be certified, to <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> at least 5 % of their properties for biodiversity purposes. In southern Sweden this mechanism becomes very relevant, since the small private forest is {{the most common form of}} ownership. This thesis aims to investigate how much the conservation value of the <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> areas differs among different estates. Furthermore the presence of structures important for biodiversity in such small private forest estates is analysed, in particular comparing <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> areas and the most ecologically valuable non <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> areas. The question that was tried to be answered was if the stands presenting the highest ecological and biodiversity values were those <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b> The study implementation consisted of inventorying ten estates certified according to FSC scheme and estimating the ecological value of the stands belonging to both, <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> and non <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> areas. A simplified biodiversity estimate was used where features representing the most important structures for forest biodiversity were checked. In particular different types of dead wood were surveyed and analysed, tree diameters (as a representation of old trees) and deciduous tree component. In addition an assessment of biodiversity potential was conducted in each stand, as a further variable which gives a score indicating the presence of valuable elements. The data analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the amount of dead wood between <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> and non <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> stands. The only difference that was found was in the amount of lying dead trees, with a slightly higher volume for the non <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> area. The field survey, combined with the biodiversity potential and the data revealed that in some cases low productive stands were preferred to stands with higher ecological characteristics in the <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> process. A lack of large trees was also noticed. In conclusion, as a general observation, it could be said that in certified small private forest estates, a good management of stands presenting high biodiversity potential is conducted. Yet here are elements that could be improved, like ensuring the percentage of the forest <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> fully corresponds to the most ecologically valuable area. Furthermore, the management could be done in a more efficient way, with more careful attention to substrates and element lacking in the landscape, such as large trees and deadwood...|$|R
