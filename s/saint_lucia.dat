5|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries, Great Britain and France had a {{territorial}} dispute over <b>Saint</b> <b>Lucia.</b> Control of <b>Saint</b> <b>Lucia</b> passed between British and French possession an estimated 14 separate times. The nation finally {{ended up in}} the United Kingdom's possession in 1814. The United Kingdom granted <b>Saint</b> <b>Lucia</b> self rule in 1967, and eventually granted the nation independence in 1979.|$|E
5|$|The Caribs who {{occupied}} {{the island of}} <b>Saint</b> <b>Lucia</b> in pre-Columbian times had a complex society, with hereditary kings and shamans. The present monarchy {{has its roots in}} the Dutch, French, and English monarchies, under the authority of which the island was first colonised in 1605, and later the British monarchy, as a Crown colony. On 22 February 1979, the country gained independence from the United Kingdom, retaining the then reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, as monarch of the newly created monarchy of <b>Saint</b> <b>Lucia.</b> The monarch is represented in the country by the Governor-General of <b>Saint</b> <b>Lucia,</b> currently Dame Pearlette Louisy.|$|E
5|$|George William Odlum (24 June 1934 – 28 September 2003) was a Saint Lucian left-wing {{politician}} {{who served as}} Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.

After working for the Commonwealth Secretariat and the West Indies Associated States, he formed the <b>Saint</b> <b>Lucia</b> Forum, a left-wing pressure group. This group merged with the <b>Saint</b> <b>Lucia</b> Labour Party {{in time for the}} 1974 elections; although the Party did not win, the progress they made allowed them to take power in 1979, with Odlum as Deputy Prime Minister.|$|E

This same ensemble also traditionally performs for cockfights, merry-go-rounds and vocal serenades, called séwinal in Lucian Creole.|$|E

5|$|The {{music of}} <b>Saint</b> <b>Lucia</b> {{is home to}} many vibrant oral and folk traditions {{and is based on}} {{elements}} derived from the music of Africa, especially rhythmically, and Western Europe, dances like the quadrille, polka and waltz. The banjo and cuatro are iconic Lucian folk instruments, especially a four-stringed banjo called the bwa poye. Celebratory songs called jwé show lyricism, and rhythmic complexity. The most important of the Afro-Lucian Creole folk dances is the kwadril. Music {{is an integral part of}} Lucian folk holidays and celebrations, as well as the good-natured rivalry between the La Rose and La Marguerite societies. There is little Western classical music on <b>Saint</b> <b>Lucia,</b> and the country's popular music industry is only nascent. There are few recording opportunities, though live music and radio remain a vital part of Lucian culture. Popular music from abroad, especially Trinidadian styles like calypso and soca, is widespread.|$|E
5|$|Upon Janet's {{formation}} {{east of the}} Windward Islands, the Weather Bureau {{office in}} San Juan, Puerto Rico advised small craft to remain in port and vessels {{in the path of}} the developing storm to exercise caution.

Storm warnings were issued for all islands in the Windward Islands from <b>Saint</b> <b>Lucia</b> south to Tobago, excluding St. Vincent and the Grenadines. All warnings in the Windward Antilles remained in effect until 1000UTC on September22. Shortly after warnings were lowered in the Windward Islands, storm warnings were issued for the ABC islands and the Paraguaná Peninsula of Venezuela at 0200UTC on September23.

The Weather Bureau later warned interests in Jamaica, but did not issue any hurricane-related warnings for the island.|$|E
