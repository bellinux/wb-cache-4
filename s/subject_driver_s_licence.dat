The second experiment examined the accuracy of recall for a brake pedal location with which they had recent practice. The last experiment attempted to determine if practice with one brake pedal location would interfere with the accuracy of reproduction of a newly learned pedal location. The results of the experiments indicate that <b>subject</b> <b>drivers</b> have difficulty in reproducing the location of brake pedals. This difficulty exists for familiar brake pedal locations as well as newly learned brake pedal location?. Further there is an indication that practice with one brake pedal location may influence the accuracy of reproducing the location one newly learned...|$|R

It presents a consequentialist challenge to recent virtue ethics, but its positive views and especially its interesting examples have great significance in their own right. <b>Driver</b> <b>s</b> defence of virtues of ignorance has force despite all the challenges to it that have been mounted over the years. But there are also examples differing from those Driver has mentioned that favour the idea of such virtues. Perhaps certain virtues of religious faith and the virtue necessary for dealing as best one can with moral dilemmas both require ignorance. However, some of the examples Driver does discuss raise the question whether virtue status is based solely on consequences, rather than perhaps having (in addition) a motivational component. ...|$|R

40|$|Acceleration is an {{important}} driving manoeuvre that has been modelled for decades as a critical element of the microscopic traffic simulation tools. The state-of-the art acceleration models have however primarily focused on lane based traffic. In lane based traffic, every driver has a single distinct lead vehicle {{in the front and}} the acceleration of the driver is typically modelled {{as a function of the}} relative speed, position and/or type of the corresponding leader. On the contrary, in a traffic stream with weak lane discipline, the <b>subject</b> <b>driver</b> may have multiple vehicles in the front. The <b>subject</b> <b>driver</b> is therefore <b>subjected</b> to multiple sources of stimulus for acceleration and reacts to the stimulus from the governing leader. However, only the applied accelerations are observed in the trajectory data, and the governing leader is unobserved or latent. The state-of-the-art models therefore cannot be directly applied to traffic streams with weak lane discipline. This prompts the current research where we present a latent leader acceleration model. The model has two components: a random utility based dynamic class membership model (latent leader component) and a class-specific acceleration model (acceleration component). The parameters of the model have been calibrated using detailed trajectory data collected from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Results indicate that the probability of a given front vehicle of being the governing leader can depend on the type of the lead vehicle and the extent of lateral overlap with the <b>subject</b> <b>driver.</b> The estimation results are compared against a simpler acceleration model (where the leader is determined deterministically) and a significant improvement in the goodness-of-fit is observed. The proposed models, when implemented in microscopic traffic simulation tools, are expected to result more realistic representation of traffic streams with weak lane discipline...|$|R

From {{the results of the}} first model, we can surmise that higher speed goes with higher speed limit and speeding violation happens frequently at lower or higher speed limit like an U shape. Most interestingly, the second model estimation shows that speed limit can influence collision severity via estimated speed, e. g., higher speed limit is associated with higher estimated speed, which in turn is related to more serious injury until the speed limit of expressway or freeway due to higher standard of engineering design.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of active safety functions like Electronic Stability Control (ESC) is of increasing importance, driven by legislation, to commercial heavy vehicle producers and to {{society as a}} whole to predict the potential benefits of the systems.

This is conducted through a simulator experiment where the <b>subject</b> <b>drivers</b> have been provoked in driving scenarios to ESC interventions. The experiment indicates the possibility of using driving simulators for evaluation purposes.

A neural network model is used as a convenient modeling technique in this initial phase of the analysis. The results indicated that most subjects made route choices based mainly on their recent experiences. It was also demonstrated that route choice behaviors are related to the personal characteristics as well as the characteristics of the respective routes. Travel experiences have less effect on the choice of the side road compared to the freeway and the results indicate that the prediction accuracy of the model, the acceptance rate of advice, and the quality of advice are closely correlated.

40|$|Sweden is {{the first}} {{country in the world}} to have {{introduced}} the so-called Vision Zero (Nollvisionen). This is an ethical approach suggesting that road safety cannot be traded for mobility. Since the beginning of mass-motoring, men have been over-represented in traffic safety statistics, in terms of both ‘causing’ accidents and casualties. Against the background of the Swedish Vision Zero, it is quite extraordinary how little attention work on traffic safety has paid to men’s over-representation in Swedish fatal road accidents (90 %), and (auto) mobility as a way of doing gender. The present article discusses how men and women <b>driver</b> <b>subjects</b> are produced through the Vision Zero discourse, with a particular focus on how men in traffic are constructed. This is important since such constructions and modes of address affect possible interventions and ‘solutions’ regarding road safety issues. Here I focus on three contemporary documents of policy making character or with general impact: first, the Governmental Act 2003 on road safety intervention; second, a report from the Swedish Road Administration which is applying a gender equality discourse on transport; and third a brochure issued by the Road Administration addressed to the everyday road user. These documents constitute case material that is illustrative of the Vision Zero as a generative apparatus of gender discourse. The article brings attention to the ambiguous ways in which the Vision Zero may, on the one hand, explicitly address men as problematic <b>driver</b> <b>subjects,</b> as an explicitly gendered high risk category; and, on the other, make men and masculine norms implicit through the rendering of young(er) <b>driver</b> <b>subjects</b> as problematic. This also involves pointing out women as an up and coming high risk category. To improve road safety, the discursive effects of this configuration suggest allocating responsibility partly to the ‘system’, partly to women <b>driver</b> <b>subjects</b> – in effect, to women who drive like men – rather than the men <b>driver</b> <b>subjects...</b>|$|R
