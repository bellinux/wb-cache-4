5|$|Super-heavy {{elements}} such as <b>seaborgium</b> are produced by bombarding lighter elements in particle accelerators that induces fusion reactions. Whereas most of the isotopes of <b>seaborgium</b> can be synthesized directly this way, some heavier ones have only been observed as decay products of elements with higher atomic numbers.|$|E
5|$|The element <b>seaborgium</b> {{was named}} after Seaborg by Albert Ghiorso, E. Kenneth Hulet, and others, who also {{credited}} Seaborg as a co-discoverer. It was named while Seaborg was still alive, which proved controversial. He influenced the naming of so many elements that with the announcement of <b>seaborgium,</b> it was noted in Discover magazine's review {{of the year in}} science that he could receive a letter addressed in chemical elements: <b>seaborgium,</b> lawrencium (for the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory where he worked), berkelium, californium, americium. <b>Seaborgium</b> is the first element ever to have been officially named after a living person. The second element to be so named is oganesson, in 2016, after Yuri Oganessian.|$|E
50|$|Tungsten has {{no known}} {{biological}} {{role in the}} human body. <b>Seaborgium's</b> high radioactivity {{would make it a}} toxic element, due to radiation poisoning.|$|R
5|$|In 2001, a team {{continued}} {{the study of}} the gas phase chemistry of <b>seaborgium</b> by reacting the element with O2 in a H2O environment. In a manner similar to the formation of the oxychloride, the results of the experiment indicated the formation of <b>seaborgium</b> oxide hydroxide, a reaction well known among the lighter group 6 homologues as well as the pseudohomologue uranium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Seaborgium</b> is {{the fourth}} member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals and the heaviest member of group 6 in the periodic table, below chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten. All {{the members of the}} group form a diversity of oxoanions. They readily portray their group oxidation state of +6, although this is highly oxidising in the case of chromium, and this state becomes more and more stable to reduction as the group is descended: indeed, tungsten is the last of the 5d transition metals where all four 5d electrons participate in metallic bonding. As such, <b>seaborgium</b> should have +6 as its most stable oxidation state, both in the gas phase and in aqueous solution, and this is the only oxidation state that is experimentally known for it; the +5 and +4 states should be less stable and the +3 state, the most common for chromium, would be the least stable for <b>seaborgium.</b> Experimental chemical investigation has been hampered due to the need to produce <b>seaborgium</b> one atom at a time, its short half-life, and the resulting necessary harshness of the experimental conditions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Seaborgium</b> should form a very {{volatile}} hexafluoride (SgF6) {{as well as}} {{a moderately}} volatile hexachloride (SgCl6), pentachloride (SgCl5), and oxychlorides SgO2Cl2 and SgOCl4. SgO2Cl2 {{is expected to be the}} most stable of the <b>seaborgium</b> oxychlorides and to be the least volatile of the group 6 oxychlorides, with the sequence MoO2Cl2 > WO2Cl2 > SgO2Cl2.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, a few {{atoms of}} <b>seaborgium</b> were {{produced}} in laboratories {{in the former}} Soviet Union and in the United States. The priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists, {{and it was not}} until 1997 that International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) established <b>seaborgium</b> as the official name for the element. It is one of only two elements named after a living person at the time of naming, the other being oganesson, element 118.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, it is a d-block transactinide element. It {{is a member of}} the 7th period and belongs to the group 6 elements as the fourth member of the 6d series of transition metals. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that <b>seaborgium</b> behaves as the heavier homologue to tungsten in group 6. The chemical properties of <b>seaborgium</b> are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 6 elements.|$|E
5|$|<b>Seaborgium</b> has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Twelve different isotopes of <b>seaborgium</b> have been reported with atomic masses 258–267, 269, and 271, three of which, seaborgium-261, 263, and 265, have known metastable states. All of these decay only through alpha decay and spontaneous fission, with the single exception of seaborgium-261 that can also undergo electron capture to dubnium-261.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2014 {{successful}} {{synthesis of}} <b>seaborgium</b> hexacarbonyl, Sg(CO)6, studies {{were conducted with}} the stable transition metals of groups 7 through 9, suggesting that carbonyl formation could be extended to further probe the chemistries of the early 6d transition metals from rutherfordium to meitnerium inclusive.|$|E
5|$|<b>Seaborgium</b> is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a body-centered cubic crystal structure, similar to its lighter congener tungsten. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 35.0g/cm3, which would be the fourth-highest of any of the 118 known elements, lower than only bohrium (37.1g/cm3), meitnerium (37.4g/cm3) and hassium (41g/cm3), the three following elements in the periodic table. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from seaborgium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough <b>seaborgium</b> to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E
5|$|The name <b>seaborgium</b> and symbol Sg were {{announced}} at the 207th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in March 1994 by Kenneth Hulet, one of the co-discovers. However, IUPAC resolved in August 1994 that an element could not be named after a living person, and Seaborg was still alive at the time. Thus, in September 1994, IUPAC recommended a set of names in which the names proposed by the three laboratories (the third being the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany) with competing claims to the discovery for elements 104 to 109 were shifted to various other elements, in which rutherfordium (Rf), the Berkeley proposal for element 104, was shifted to element 106, with <b>seaborgium</b> being dropped entirely as a name.|$|E
5|$|<b>Seaborgium</b> is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Sg and atomic number 106. It {{is named after}} the American nuclear chemist Glenn T. Seaborg. It is {{a synthetic}} element (an element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature) and radioactive; the most stable known isotope, 269Sg, has a half-life of approximately 3.1minutes.|$|E
5|$|After a {{new term}} of {{negotiations}} between the parties, IUPAC decided to allow the name <b>seaborgium</b> for element 106 and changed the name of element 102 to flerovium after Georgy Flerov following the recognition by the 1993 report that the element had been first convincingly synthesized in Dubna. However, this compromise was also rejected by the American scientists and the decision was retracted. The name flerovium was later used for element 114.|$|E
5|$|The proton-rich {{isotopes}} from 258Sg to 261Sg {{were directly}} produced by cold fusion; all heavier isotopes were produced from the repeated alpha decay of the heavier elements hassium, darmstadtium, and flerovium, with the exceptions of the isotopes 263mSg, 264Sg, 265Sg, and 265mSg, which were directly produced by hot fusion through irradiation of actinide targets. The twelve isotopes of <b>seaborgium</b> have half-lives ranging from 92microseconds for 261Sg to 3.1minutes for 269Sg.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Soviet {{scientist}} Victor Cherdyntsev, who {{had previously}} claimed the existence of primordial curium-247, claimed to have discovered element 108 (specifically, the 267Hs isotope, which supposedly had a half-life of 400 to 500million years) in natural molybdenite and suggested the name sergenium (symbol Sg; at the time, this symbol {{had not yet been}} taken by <b>seaborgium)</b> for it, after the ancient city of Serik along the Silk Road in Kazakhstan where his molybdenite samples came from. His rationale for claiming that sergenium was the heavier homologue to osmium was that minerals supposedly containing sergenium formed volatile oxides when boiled in nitric acid, similarly to osmium. His findings were criticized by V. M. Kulakov on the grounds that some of the properties Cherdyntsev claimed sergenium had were inconsistent with the then-current nuclear physics.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, IUPAC {{published}} a recommendation on naming the disputed elements following the previous reports. For element 105, they proposed the name joliotium (Jl), after the French physicist Frédéric Joliot-Curie, a significant {{contributor to the}} development of nuclear physics and chemistry; this name was originally proposed by the Soviet team for element 102, which by then had long been called nobelium. (The name nielsbohrium for element 107 was transformed to bohrium to conform with the practice set by all then-named elements.) This recommendation paper was generally met with criticism from the American scientists: their recommendations were scrambled (the names rutherfordium and hahnium, originally suggested by Berkeley for elements 104 and 105, were used for elements 106 and 108, respectively); both elements 104 and 105 were given names suggested by the Russian team despite earlier recognition of the Berkeley team as of an equal co-discoverer; and especially because the name <b>seaborgium</b> for element 106 was rejected for honoring a living person, a rule that had only just been approved. These names were to be accepted on a Council meeting in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg was the {{principal}} or co-discoverer of ten elements: plutonium, americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, nobelium and element 106, which, {{while he was still}} living, was named <b>seaborgium</b> in his honor. He also discovered more than 100 atomic isotopes and is credited with important contributions to the chemistry of plutonium, originally as part of the Manhattan Project where he developed the extraction process used to isolate the plutonium fuel for the second atomic bomb. Early in his career, he was a pioneer in nuclear medicine and discovered isotopes of elements with important applications in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, most notably iodine-131, which is used in the treatment of thyroid disease. In addition to his theoretical work {{in the development of the}} actinide concept, which placed the actinide series beneath the lanthanide series on the periodic table, he postulated the existence of super-heavy elements in the transactinide and superactinide series.|$|E
5|$|Other {{possibilities}} {{to synthesize}} nuclei {{on the island}} of stability include quasifission (partial fusion followed by fission) of a massive nucleus. Such nuclei tend to fission, expelling doubly magic or nearly doubly magic fragments such as calcium-40, tin-132, lead-208, or bismuth-209. Recently {{it has been shown that}} the multi-nucleon transfer reactions in collisions of actinide nuclei (such as uranium and curium) might be used to synthesize the neutron-rich superheavy nuclei located at the island of stability, although formation of the lighter elements nobelium or <b>seaborgium</b> is more favored. One last possibility to synthesize isotopes near the island is to use controlled nuclear explosions to create a neutron flux high enough to bypass the gaps of instability at 258–260Fm and at mass number 275 (atomic numbers 104 to 108), mimicking the r-process in which the actinides were first produced in nature and the gap of instability around radon bypassed. Some such isotopes (especially 291Cn and 293Cn) may even have been synthesized in nature, but would have decayed away far too quickly (with half-lives of only thousands of years) and be produced in far too small quantities (about 10−12 the abundance of lead) to be detectable as primordial nuclides today outside cosmic rays.|$|E
5|$|Several {{experiments}} {{have been performed}} between 2000 and 2004 at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna studying the fission characteristics of the compound nucleus 292Fl by bombarding a plutonium-244 target with accelerated calcium-48 ions. A compound nucleus is a loose combination of nucleons {{that have not yet}} arranged themselves into nuclear shells. It has no internal structure and is held together only by the collision forces between the target and projectile nuclei. The results revealed how nuclei such as this fission predominantly by expelling doubly magic or nearly doubly magic fragments such as calcium-40, tin-132, lead-208, or bismuth-209. It was also found that the yield for the fusion-fission pathway was similar between calcium-48 and iron-58 projectiles, indicating a possible future use of iron-58 projectiles in superheavy element formation. It has also been suggested that a neutron-rich flerovium isotope can be formed by the quasifission (partial fusion followed by fission) of a massive nucleus. Recently {{it has been shown that}} the multi-nucleon transfer reactions in collisions of actinide nuclei (such as uranium and curium) might be used to synthesize the neutron-rich superheavy nuclei located at the island of stability, although production of neutron-rich nobelium or <b>seaborgium</b> nuclei is more likely.|$|E
25|$|<b>Seaborgium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with the symbol Sg and atomic number 106. <b>Seaborgium</b> is a synthetic element whose most stable isotope 271Sg has a half-life of 1.9 minutes. Chemistry experiments with <b>seaborgium</b> have firmly {{placed it in}} group 6 as a heavier homologue to tungsten. <b>Seaborgium</b> was independently discovered by groups at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 1974, and was {{named in honor of}} the American chemist Glenn T.

25|$|Glenn T. Seaborg, a Nobel Prize-winning chemist {{and major}} {{contributor}} {{in the discovery}} {{of several of the}} transuranium elements, was born in Ishpeming. Before his death in 1999, he was the only living person to have a chemical element named after him (<b>seaborgium,</b> abbreviated as Sg and with atomic number 106). This name caused controversy because Seaborg was still alive, but eventually it was accepted by international chemists. Though he lived most of his life in California, the Seaborg Center at Northern Michigan University is named in his honor.|$|E
500|$|The {{volatile}} seaborgium(VI) compounds SgCl6 and SgOCl4 {{are expected}} to be unstable to decomposition to seaborgium(V) compounds at high temperatures, analogous to MoCl6 and MoOCl4; this should not happen for SgO2Cl2 due to the much higher energy gap between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, despite the similar Sg–Cl bond strengths (similarly to molybdenum and tungsten). Thus, in the first experimental chemical studies of <b>seaborgium</b> in 1995 and 1996, <b>seaborgium</b> atoms were produced in the reaction 248Cm(22Ne,4n)266Sg, thermalised, and reacted with an O2/HCl mixture. The adsorption properties of the resulting oxychloride were measured and compared with those of molybdenum and tungsten compounds. The results indicated that <b>seaborgium</b> formed a volatile oxychloride akin to those of the other group 6 elements, and confirmed the decreasing trend of oxychloride volatility down group 6: ...|$|E
500|$|Molybdenum and {{tungsten}} {{are very}} similar to each other and show important differences to the smaller chromium, and <b>seaborgium</b> is expected to follow the chemistry of tungsten and molybdenum quite closely, forming an even greater variety of oxoanions, the simplest among them being seaborgate, , which would form from the rapid hydrolysis of , although this would take place less readily than with molybdenum and tungsten as expected from seaborgium's greater size. <b>Seaborgium</b> should hydrolyse less readily than tungsten in hydrofluoric acid at low concentrations, but more readily at high concentrations, also forming complexes such as SgO3F− and : complex formation competes with hydrolysis in hydrofluoric acid.

500|$|This {{stabilisation}} of {{the highest}} oxidation state occurs in the early 6d elements because of the similarity between the energies of the 6d and 7s orbitals, since the 7s orbitals are relativistically stabilised and the 6d orbitals are relativistically destabilised. This effect is so large in the seventh period that <b>seaborgium</b> is expected to lose its 6d electrons before its 7s electrons (Sg, 5f146d47s2; Sg+, 5f146d37s2; Sg2+, 5f146d37s1; Sg4+, 5f146d2; Sg6+, 5f14). Because of the great destabilisation of the 7s orbital, SgIV should be even more unstable than WIV and should be very readily oxidised to SgVI. The predicted ionic radius of the hexacoordinate Sg6+ ion is 65pm, while the predicted atomic radius of <b>seaborgium</b> is 128pm. Nevertheless, the stability {{of the highest}} oxidation state is still expected to decrease as LrIII > RfIV > DbV > SgVI. Some predicted standard reduction potentials for <b>seaborgium</b> ions in aqueous acidic solution are as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|Bowing {{to public}} pressure, IUPAC {{proposed}} a different compromise in August 1995, {{in which the}} name <b>seaborgium</b> was reinstated for element 106 {{in exchange for the}} removal of all the other American proposals, which met an even worse response. Finally, IUPAC rescinded these previous compromises and made a final, new recommendation in August 1997, in which the American and German proposals for elements 104 to 109 were all adopted, including <b>seaborgium</b> for element 106, with the single exception of element 105, named dubnium to recognise the contributions of the Dubna team to the experimental procedures of transactinide synthesis.

500|$|This {{decision}} {{ignited a}} firestorm of worldwide protest for disregarding the historic discoverer's right to name new elements, and against the new retroactive rule against naming elements after living persons; the American Chemical Society stood firmly behind the name <b>seaborgium</b> for element 106, together {{with all the other}} American and German naming proposals for elements 104 to 109, approving these names for its journals in defiance of IUPAC. At first, IUPAC defended itself, with an American member of its committee writing: [...] "Discoverers don't have a right to name an element. They have a right to suggest a name. And, of course, we didn't infringe on that at all." [...] However, Seaborg responded: ...|$|E
500|$|A more {{promising}} application of 242Cm {{is to produce}} 238Pu, a more suitable radioisotope for thermoelectric generators such as in cardiac pacemakers. The alternative routes to 238Pu use the (n,γ) reaction of 237Np, or the deuteron bombardment of uranium, which both always produce 236Pu as an undesired by-product — since the latter decays to 232U with strong gamma emission.

Thus, bombardment of 248Cm with oxygen (18O), magnesium (26Mg), or calcium (48Ca) yielded certain isotopes of <b>seaborgium</b> (265Sg), hassium (269Hs and 270Hs), and livermorium (292Lv, 293Lv, and possibly 294Lv).
