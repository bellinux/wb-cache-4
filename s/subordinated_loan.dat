40|$|This paper {{argues that}} banks must be {{sufficiently}} levered to have first-best incentives {{to make new}} risky loans. This result, which {{is at odds with}} the notion that leverage invariably leads to excessive risk taking, derives from two key premises that focus squarely on the role of banks as informed lenders. First, banks finance projects that they do not own, which implies that they cannot extract all the profits. Second, banks conduct a credit risk analysis before making new loans. Our model may help understand why banks take on additional unsecured debt, such as unsecured deposits and <b>subordinated</b> <b>loans,</b> over and above their existing deposit base. It may also help understand why banks and finance companies have similar leverage ratios, even though the latter are not deposit takers and hence not subject to the same regulatory capital requirements as banks. ...|$|R
40|$|Budgetary {{constraints}} are prompting many {{governments to}} encourage private financing of transportation infrastructure through concession contracts. The length {{and complexity of}} such contracts often force governments to provide fiscal support {{in order to increase}} the attractiveness of concessions. This paper deals with a new public support mechanism for concession contracts, called <b>Subordinated</b> Public Participation <b>Loans</b> (SPPLs), which has been implemented in Spain during the last few years. SPPLs are <b>subordinated</b> <b>loans</b> that may be given by the government to the concessionaire if the latter requests them in the tender. SPPLs are defined {{in such a way that}} the increase in interest accrued will reflect the traffic level: the larger the traffic the larger will be the SPPL yield. SPPLs have a twofold goal. First, they increase the financial attractiveness, and hence the feasibility, of concessions contracts. And second, they set up a fairer risksharing approach between the public and the private sector. This paper analyzes the implications of SPPLs in motorway concessions by contrasting the theoretical analysis with the empirical results obtained form the tender of five motorway concessions in Spain. Overall we found that the implementation of this mechanism may be considered a success. In spite of that, we propose some measures that may contribute to improving the SPPL performance in the future...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Present {{days the}} firms {{have to face}} the {{increasing}} competition, difficult economic conditions and an increasing need for major investments. In these circumstances, even the well managed and highly profitable businesses have limited options for financing growth or strengthening their equity resources. In these conditions, alternative forms of financing such as mezzanine finance {{are becoming more and more}} a supplement to the traditional forms of corporate financing. Mezzanine is a type of financing that combines elements of debt and equity financing, a hybrid construct that makes use of various longstanding instruments. The most important mezzanine financing instruments include: <b>subordinated</b> <b>loans,</b> participating loans, profit participation rights, convertible bonds and bonds with warrants. A common feature of the various instruments is that they can be structured flexibly in many different forms in order to provide solutions for the specific financing requirements of private and listed companies.

The problems that emerged, and some of the lessons learned, in the aborted award of the West Coast franchise in 2012 are assessed. A detailed assessment is also made of the East Coast franchise.

We use a novel data series of loan servicing records from 2002 until 2010 to identify such borrowers and find evidence that the default behavior of these borrowers significantly differs from borrowers without second loans. Estimating a discrete-time proportional odds hazard model, we find borrowers with a second loan were 62. 7 % more likely to default each month on their primary loan when conditioning alone on the attributes of the primary loan. However, borrowers of second loans were 58. 3 % less likely to default on their primary loan as compared to single loan borrowers with equivalent current combined attributes (i. e., loan-to-value, balance, and interest rate). We hypothesize and provide empirical evidence this occurs because borrowers with second loans have the option to sequentially default on each <b>loan</b> since <b>subordinate</b> lenders will not pursue foreclosure if borrowers have insufficient equity. Lenders of defaulted subordinate debt may revisit their decision to foreclose in the future after housing markets start to recover, thus prompting a new round of foreclosures...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{show that}} Japan {{will not be}} able to have a viable banking sector without {{stopping}} deflation. The banking industry has not shown a profit since fiscal 1993 (ended March 1994) if one excludes capital gains from stock and real estate portfolios. I quantify the financial condition of the sector and show that interest margins have been too low to cover the increase in loan losses brought about by the weak economy. Banks cannot raise margins for several reasons: competition with subsidized government sponsored financial institutions (GFIs); intense political pressure, backed by the Financial Services Agency (FSA), to make new loans to small and medium companies; and deflation-weakened borrowers. I expect that the Japanese government will have to nationalize most of the banking sector by 2005. Capital injections will not solve the problems. Established Japanese life insurance companies are also troubled because they over-promised the amount that they could pay. This can be corrected through a reorganization where the promised interest rates are cut. But this is complicated because Japanese banks and life insurance companies are providing each other capital a practice called double-gearing. Weakened banks ask insurance companies to provide equity capital and <b>subordinated</b> <b>loans.</b> In return, the mutual life insurers ask banks to subscribe their surplus notes (similar to non-voting redeemable preferred shares) and subordinated debt. The risks of double-gearing are analyzed. ...|$|R
