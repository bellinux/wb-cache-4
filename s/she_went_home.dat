25|$|Native {{legend of}} the Lil'wat {{subgroup}} of the St'at'imc tells of a girl named Chinook-Wind, who married Glacier, and moved to his country, {{which was in the}} area of today's Birkenhead River. She pined for her warm sea-home in the southwest, and sent a message to her people. They came to her in a vision in the form of snowflakes, and told her they were coming to get her. They came in great number and quarrelled with Glacier over her, but they overwhelmed him and <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> with them in the end.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Stoltenberg {{went into}} more detail {{about how she}} {{started out as a}} drug addict, to TV {{journalist}} Tonje Steinsland–the second time her life as an addict {{was the subject of a}} television special. It started in 1991, when she was 27. She witnessed two drug addicts in a fight in a cafe in Oslo when something fell out of the pocket of one of them. She picked it up and saw that it was heroin. Together with her boyfriend <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> and decided to snort the drug. For the next three years she was an intravenous drug user. By the end of the 1990s, she was close to dying. In the interview, Stoltenberg also tells of a boyfriend who subjected her to punishments, psychological terror and much fear, however, the heroin turned all of that into a feeling of freedom and made her perceive their relationship as simply wonderful, for a while.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to these comments, Carina MacKenzie of Zap2it stated, [...] "We're left wondering if Safran missed the part where <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> bleeding because Chuck was using physical intimidation to release his own emotions." [...] While reviewing the episode, Tierney Bricker of Zap2it felt that there were [...] "really no excuses for Chuck Bass anymore." [...] MacKenzie concluded that Chuck's behavior throughout [...] fit the signs of an abusive relationship, citing examples from HelpGuide.org, a non-profit health resource. She noted Chuck's public humiliation of Blair, his attempt to pawn her during a business deal, and his use of physical intimidation. MacKenzie also called the show's explanation [...] "disturbing, particularly given the young, female target demographic of Gossip Girl and The CW." ...|$|E

500|$|By 30 January 1920, {{the ship}} was in Constantinople and Cardiff arrived at Odessa on 4 February and Admiral Hope concurred in the {{decision}} to evacuate the city {{in the face of the}} advancing Bolsheviks. The ship departed the city the next day, but returned on 11 February and Hope assumed command of all British forces in the city. By late March, {{the ship was}} stationed in the Crimea until the Whites were forced to evacuate in November. On 6 November, Cardiff picked up Charles I of Austria, the last Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, and his wife, Zita at Sulina, Romania, and conveyed them to their exile in the Portuguese island of Madeira, where they arrived on 19 November. The ship was present during the Great Fire of Smyrna almost a year later in mid-September 1922, close to the end of the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–22. She remained in the Mediterranean until 1929 when <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> for a lengthy refit. During Cardiffs time in the Mediterranean, she was fitted with a pair of 2-pounder (40mm) Mk II [...] "pom-pom" [...] AA guns in 1923–24 and her original [...] rangefinders was exchanged for [...] models during the mid-1920s. From 1931 to May 1933, she was assigned to the Africa Station as the flagship of the 6th Cruiser Squadron. The ship returned home that month and replaced her half-sister [...] as flagship of the Nore Reserve in July. The following year, she was transferred to the Chatham Reserve as their flagship and participated in the Silver Jubilee Fleet review for King George V on 16 July 1935. Cardiff was also present for the Coronation Fleet Review for King George VI on 20 May 1937. [...] The ship was considered for conversion into an anti-aircraft cruiser in June 1938, but programme delays caused the conversion to be pushed back. A month later, Cardiff was recommissioned for service with the 5th Cruiser Squadron on the China Station. The ship departed Hong Kong on 29 April 1939 for the UK where she was again placed in reserve.|$|E
2500|$|She {{took the}} work, without loss of time, to Mr. Scribner, proposing he should publish it. He demurred a little, {{saying he would}} gladly do so if the {{translation}} were ready, but that the war would be over before the book was out, Mr. Seward having authoritatively limited its duration to a small number not of weeks but of days. Mr. Scribner finally said, perhaps but half believing in the possibility, that {{if it could be}} ready in a week he would publish it. [...] "It shall be done," [...] was her reply, and <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> and went to work, working twenty hours of every twenty-four, receiving the proofsheets at night and returning them with fresh copy in the morning. The week lacked several hours of its completion when the work was finished, and in a fortnight the book was out, and its message rang from Maine to California.|$|E
2500|$|On June 30 and July 1, the {{prosecutor}} presented rebuttal arguments, beginning by showing the jury photographs of Caylee's clothes and George's suicide note.

A police computer analyst testified someone had purposely searched online for [...] "neck + breaking." [...] Another analyst testified she did not find evidence that Cindy Anthony had searched certain terms she claimed to have searched. Anthropology professor Dr. Michael Warren from the University of Florida was recalled to rebut a defense witness {{on the need to}} open a skull during an autopsy. The lead detective stated that there were no phone calls between Cindy and George Anthony during the week of June16, 2008. However, he told the defense he did not know that George had a second cell phone.|$|E

2500|$|Philip's husband, {{brother and}} family dispute {{much of what}} the police say and their interpretations of the {{documentary}} evidence. She was fired from Cabrini not because of alcoholism but because she had been a [...] "whistleblower" [...] who complained about racial and sexual bias (the hospital later told a reporter it had no evidence of any formal complaints by her). Lieberman says that while his wife frequented lesbian bars, it was because she did not want a repeat of the situation that had happened with her coworker. She never had sex with the women <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> with, he claims, and they would often merely listen to music, sleep or paint. One time, in fact, she came home covered with paint after going home with an artist. Her drinking was a temporary phase to ease her through the depression she was experiencing after being fired by Cabrini, and would stop once her life got back to normal, as he believed it was doing.|$|E
