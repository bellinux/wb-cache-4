40|$|Intraluminal {{manometric}} {{studies of}} normal swallowing activity fail {{to distinguish between}} the peristaltic response of <b>striated</b> <b>and</b> smooth muscle. Studies were performed to determine if the two types of musculature differ in their response to pharmacological stimulation. After the administration of d-tubocurarine, peristaltic amplitude in the striated muscle segment decreased by 26 to 51 %, while amplitude in the smooth muscle portion was not significantly affected. The administration of atropine, on the other hand, abolished or diminished smooth muscle peristalsis without altering striated muscle activity. The injection of neostigmine restored peristaltic amplitude toward normal in both <b>striated</b> <b>and</b> smooth muscle portions. These studies demonstrate that although the <b>striated</b> <b>and</b> smooth muscle segments are indistinguishable during normal oesophageal peristalsis, they do differ markedly in their pharmacological response. Pharmacologically, oesophageal striated muscle responds like other <b>striated</b> muscle <b>and</b> oesophageal smooth muscle responds like smooth muscle elsewhere...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two types}} of CGCG's, non-aggressive and aggressive. The former has a slow rate of growth and thus less likely to resorb roots <b>and</b> <b>perforate</b> the {{cortical}} plate.

40|$|Muscles and {{different}} proteins obtained from scallops (Chlamys tehuelchus and Zygochlamys patagonica) were analyzed. In both species of scallop, the thermograms of <b>striated</b> <b>and</b> smooth muscles showed two endothermic transitions. The T max values corresponding to <b>striated</b> <b>and</b> smooth muscles from C. tehuelchus were 53. 2, 79. 0 °C and 52. 7, 78. 0 °C, respectively. The T max corresponding to <b>striated</b> <b>and</b> smooth muscles of Z. patagonica were 55. 0, 79. 2 °C and 54. 7, 78. 7 °C, respectively. No {{significant differences were}} observed between the thermal transitions of myofibrils and actomyosin of both types of muscles from both species of scallop. Irrespective of the species, the thermal stability decreased when the pH of the muscles was increased. The increase in ionic strength greatly affected T max, the ΔH total and the ΔH of the first transition. A significant decrease in ΔH total and ΔH corresponding to both transitions was observed, particularly in the striated muscles of Zygochlamys patagonica. These results indicate a major sensitivity of the adductor muscles of Zygochlamys {{to changes in the}} chemical environment...|$|R

40|$|Laparoscopy {{has become}} a routine {{procedure}} {{in the management of}} acute abdominal disease and can be considered both an excellent therapeutic and additional diagnostic tool in selected cases.

In recent years, abdominal emergencies have increasingly been managed successfully by laparoscopy. In acute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis <b>and</b> <b>perforated</b> peptic ulcer, randomized controlled trials have proven that the laparoscopic approach is as safe and as effective as open surgery, with fewer complications and a quicker postoperative recovery.
