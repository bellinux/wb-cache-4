Animals have adaptation and survival <b>strategies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season.

5|$|The USAAF {{assessed}} {{that the}} firebombing campaign had been highly successful, {{and noted that}} American losses during these attacks were much lower than those incurred during day precision raids. Accordingly, the Joint Target Group (JTG), which was the Washington, D.C.-based organisation responsible for developing <b>strategies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> air campaign against Japan, developed plans for a two-stage campaign against 22 Japanese cities. The JTG also recommended that precision bombing attacks on particularly important industrial facilities continue in parallel to the area raids, however. While this campaign was intended to form part of preparations for the Allied invasion of Japan, LeMay and some members of Arnold's staff believed that it alone would be sufficient to force the country's surrender.|$|E

The third strategy proposed development of a radically new battleship type, superior to any foreign adversary. The idea of a all-big-gun battleship was ruled out from the start, as the Navy tacticians considered an increase in the number of 12-inch guns to be overkill.|$|E
