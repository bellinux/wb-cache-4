40|$|In this presentation, CiDRA’s {{patented}} technology platform and its applications will be described. CiDRA's non-invasive, passive sonar array-based flow meter technology performs two independent measurements – flow rate and fluid characterization. Firstly, the meter provides the {{volumetric flow rate}} of the mixture by measuring {{the speed at which}} naturally occurring structures such as turbulent eddies or density variations convect with the flow past an axial array of sensors. Secondly, the meter uses similar sonar-based processing techniques and naturally occurring sound in the process slurry to measure entrained air levels and in some cases fluid composition. The result is a unique ability to measure the flow rate and entrained air level of most fluids – clean liquids, high solids content slurries, pastes, and liquids and slurries with entrained air. Also to be presented is the application of this array-based technology platform in a variety of hydrotransport and minerals beneficiation applications. Examples of these situations include volume flow measurements in tailings lines, thickener discharge, high solids contents pipelines, <b>slurry</b> <b>lines</b> with magnetite and other magnetic ore, <b>slurry</b> <b>lines</b> with abrasive or corrosive materials, high pressure <b>lines,</b> and <b>slurry</b> and non-slurry <b>lines</b> exhibiting scale buildup. The operational advantages and value of these measurements, even in the presence of scale buildup, will be discussed.

40|$|Slurry-based 3 D {{printing}} is a {{new technology}} designed to further increase the feature resolution capabilities of 3 D printing. This technology deposits an unprinted wet slurry layer by rapidly depositing overlapping parallel <b>lines</b> of <b>slurry</b> to form each layer. Line registration may affect the final properties of the part and it is therefore desirable to control the registration of <b>slurry</b> <b>lines</b> within each layer and from one layer to the next. A galvanometer was used to adjust nozzle position to compensate for line position errors. The galvo correction was calculated and actuated using a PMAC controller running programmable logic controller programs. The line spacing controller is successful in improving line spacing and registration over open loop performance. However, the degree of line position improvement is not certain due to measurement errors. Because of the large measurement variability, the line spacing may actually be better than measured. Developing more accurate diagnostics is important to determine {{the accuracy of the}} line position controller.

The purpose of the control decision meetings was to review and revise previously selected controls for the prevention or mitigation of waste transfer leak accidents.

40|$|The largest coal deposit in the United States, Black Mesa, rests {{upon the}} border of the Navajo and Hopi {{reservations}} in northwest Arizona. Peabody Energy gained permits to mine coal in 1966 and the subsequent mining operation shaped the history of the Southwest. The coal powered many western cities and was profitable for Peabody Energy. The Hopi reservation was not only home to the largest coal mine, its 650, 000 acres are situated above the N-Aquifer. It is arguable that water is the most sacred essence to Hopi culture. Their beliefs are deeply spiritual and rooted in respect for the earth and balance. Water is not only crucial in this area for survival, but also their spiritual ceremonies. Therefore, water is a cultural resource to the Hopi. Access to this natural resource was gained through deceptive politics and exploitation of two indigenous populations. Peabody Energy needed a way to transport the coal from remote northwest Arizona to the Mohave Generating Station, 273 miles away. The company created a slurry pipeline: the coal was crushed into small pieces, mixed with underground water, and pushed through the pipeline to the Mohave Generating Station. The water used for this <b>slurry</b> <b>line</b> came from the N-Aquifer, the only water resource in the region. Peabody Energy pumped an average of 3. 3 million gallons of water a day for 35 years from this aquifer. The health of the aquifer and surrounding springs are showing declines upwards of 25 percent.

40|$|This {{calculation}} note {{supports the}} subsurface leak accident scenario which remains subsurface. It {{is assumed that}} a single walled pipe carrying waste from tank 106 -C ruptures, releasing the liquid waste into the soil. In this scenario, the waste does not form a surface pool, but remains subsurface. However, above the pipe is a berm, 0. 762 m (2. 5 ft) high and 2. 44 m (8 ft) wide, and the liquid released from the leak rises into the berm. The <b>slurry</b> <b>line,</b> which transports a source term of higher activity than the sluice line, leaks into the soil {{at a rate of}} 5 % of the maximum flow rate of 28. 4 L/s (450 gpm) for twelve hours. The dose recipient was placed a perpendicular distance of 100 m from the pipe. Two source terms were considered, mitigated and unmitigated release as described in section 3. 4. 1 of UANF-SD-WM-BIO- 001, Addendum 1. The unmitigated consisted of two parts of AWF liquid and one part AWF solid. The mitigated release consisted of two parts SST liquid, eighteen parts AWF liquid, nine parts SST solid, and one part AWF solid. The isotopic breakdown of the release in these cases is presented. Two geometries were considered in preliminary investigations, disk source, and rectangular source. Since the rectangular source results from the assumption that the contamination is wicked up into the berm, only six inches of shielding from uncontaminated earth is present, while the disk source, which remains six inches below the level of the surface of the land is often shielded by a thick shield due to the slant path to the dose point. For this reason, only the rectangular source was considered in the final analysis. The source model was a rectangle 2. 134 m (7 ft) thick, 0. 6096 m (2 ft) high, and 130. 899 m (131 ft) long. The top and sides of this rectangular source was covered with earth of density 1. 6 g/cm{sup 3 } to a thickness of 15. 24 cm (6 in). This soil is modeled as 40 % void space. The source consisted of earth of the same density with the void spaces filled with the liquid waste which added 0. 56 g/cm{sup 3 } to the density. The dose point was 100 m (328 ft) away from the berm in a perpendicular direction off the center. The computer code MICROSKYSHINEO was used to calculate the skyshine from the source. This code calculates exposure rate at the receptor point. The photon spectrum from 2 MeV to 0. 15 MeV, obtained from ISOSHLD, was used as input, although this did not differ substantially from the results obtained from using Co, 137 mBa, and 154 Eu. However, this methodology allowed the bremsstrahlung contribution {{to be included in the}} skyshine calculation as well as in the direct radiation calculation...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project was to conduct intensive {{research and development of}} the Coal Log Pipeline (CLP). Specifically, the R & D was to concentrate on previously neglected and insufficiently studied aspects of CLP which were deemed significant. With improvements in these areas, CLP could be implemented for commercial use within five years. CLP technology is capable of transporting coal logs for long distances. The many potential advantages of CLP over truck and railroad transportation include: lower freight costs, less energy consumption, less air pollution, decreased environmental problems, increased safety, and improved reliability. Previous studies have shown that CLP is advantageous over slurry pipeline technology. First, CLP uses one-third the water required by a coal slurry pipeline. Second, CLP provides easier coal dewatering. Third, the CLP conveying capacity of coal is twice as much as a <b>slurry</b> transport <b>line</b> of equal diameter. In many situations, the cost for transporting each ton of coal is expected to be less expensive by CLP as compared to other competing modes of transportation such as: truck, unit train and slurry pipeline...|$|R
40|$|The {{global demand}} of mining {{products}} has increased during recent years, {{and there is}} pressure to improve the efficiency of mines and concentration processes. This thesis focuses on froth flotation, {{which is one of}} the most common concentration methods in mineral engineering. Froth flotation is used to separate valuable minerals from mined ore that has been crushed, mixed with water and ground to a small particle size. The separation is based on differences in the surface chemical properties of the minerals. Monitoring and control of flotation processes mainly relies on the on-line analysis of the process slurry streams. Traditionally, the analysis is performed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyzers that measure the elemental contents of the solids in the slurries. The thesis investigates the application of visual and near-infrared (VNIR) reflectance spectroscopy to improve the on-line analysis of mineral flotation froths and slurries. In reflectance spectroscopy the sample is illuminated and the spectrum of the reflected light is captured by a spectrograph. The main benefits of VNIR reflectance spectroscopy with respect to XRF-based analysis are the relatively low cost of the equipment required and the easy and fast measurement process. As a consequence, the sampling rate of the reflectance spectrum measurement is radically faster than in the XRF analysis. Data-based modeling is applied to the measured VNIR spectra to calculate the corresponding elemental contents. The research is conducted at a real copper and zinc flotation process. The main results of the thesis show that VNIR reflectance spectroscopy can be used to measure temporal changes in the elemental contents of mineral flotation froths and slurries in the analyzed process. Especially the slurry measurements from the final concentrates provide accurate information on the slurry contents. A multi-channel slurry VNIR analyzer prototype is developed in this thesis. When combined with an XRF analyzer, it is able to measure the <b>slurry</b> <b>lines</b> with a very fast sampling rate. This considerably improves the monitoring and control possibilities of the flotation process. The proposed VNIR analyzer is adaptively calibrated with the sparse XRF measurements to compensate for the effect of changes in other slurry properties. The high-frequency slurry analysis is shown to reveal fast grade changes and grade oscillations that the XRF analyzer is unable to detect alone. Based on the new measurement, a plant-wide study of the harmful grade oscillations is conducted in order to improve the performance of the flotation process...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{industry}} {{has long had}} a need to better understand and control its papermaking process upstream, specifically at the wet end in the forming section of a paper machine. A vision-based system is under development that addresses this need by automatically measuring and interpreting the pertinent paper web parameters at the wet end in real time. The wet-end characterization of the paper web by a vision system involves a four-dimensional measurement of the slurry in real time. These measurements include the two-dimensional spatial information, the intensity profile, and the depth profile. This paper describes the real-time depth profile measurement system for the high-speed moving slurry.

40|$|This project, {{which began}} in FY 97, {{involves}} both the flow loop research on plugging and unplugging of waste transfer pipelines, and the large-scale industrial equipment test of plugging locating and unplugging technologies. In FY 98, the related work was performed under the project name ''Mixing, Settling, and Pipe Unplugging of Waste Transfer Lines. '' The mixing, settling, and pipeline plugging and unplugging are critical to the design and maintenance of a waste transfer pipeline system, especially for the High-Level Waste (HLW) pipeline transfer. The major objective of this work is to recreate pipeline plugging conditions for equipment testing of plug locating and removal and to provide systematic operating data for modification of equipment design and enhancement of performance of waste transfer lines used at DOE sites. As the waste tank clean-out and decommissioning program becomes active at the DOE sites, there is an increasing potential that the waste <b>slurry</b> transfer <b>lines</b> will become plugged and unable to transport waste slurry from one tank to another or from the mixing tank to processing facilities. Transfer systems may potentially become plugged if the solids concentration of the material being transferred increases beyond the capability of the prime mover or if upstream mixing is inadequately performed. Plugging can occur due to the solids' settling in either the mixing tank, the pumping system, or the transfer lines. In order to enhance and optimize the slurry's removal and transfer, refined and reliable data on the mixing, sampling, and pipe unplugging systems must be obtained based on both laboratory-scale and simulated in-situ operating conditions...|$|R

In the animal line, a total of 256 isolates were collected from pregnant sows (10 samples and 20 isolates), 1 -week-old piglets (20 samples and 40 isolates), unweaned piglets (20 samples and 38 isolates), growers (20 samples and 40 isolates), and the finishers' floor pen (6 samples and 118 isolates); from the underfloor pits and farm <b>slurry</b> tank environmental <b>lines,</b> 100 and 119 isolates, respectively, were collected. Our results showed that E. coli populations in the pig fecal microbiota and in the farm environment are highly dynamic and show high levels of diversity. These issues have been proven through DNA-based typing data (repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR [REP-PCR]) and phenotypic typing data (antimicrobial resistance profile comprising 19 antimicrobials). Clustering of the sampling groups based on their REP-PCR typing results showed that the spatial features (the line) had a stronger weight than the temporal features (sampling week) for the clustering of E. coli populations; this weight was less significant when clustering was performed based on resistotypes. Among animals, finishers harbored an E. coli population different from those of the remaining animal populations studied, considering REP-PCR fingerprints and resistotypes. This population, the most important from a public health perspective, demonstrated the lowest levels of antimicrobial resistance and integron presence...|$|R
40|$|The Lasentec M 600 in-line {{particle}} size analyzer was installed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in August 1998 to support retrieval of the Gunite and Associated Tanks (GAAT). Before installation at ORNL, the sensor underwent validation testing at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) Instrument Validation facility. Mechanically, the instrument worked well during validation testing and met all expectations. Operationally, much was learned about optimum ways to display and interpret the data. Slurry samples taken during the in-line tests at PNNL were shipped to the vendor for analysis with a benchtop Lasentec sensor. These experiments were performed to determine if off-line analyses yield {{particle size}} distributions similar to those generated by the in-line sensor. It was determined that the Lasentec sensor measures repeatable chord lengths as long as particles are ''presenter'' to the sensor window the same way. After the initial non-radioactive simulant testing at PNNL, the instrument was shipped for radioactive validation and acceptance testing in the Slurry Monitoring Test System (SMTS) connected to the Tank W- 9 of the GAATs at ORNL. For all acceptance tests conducted at ORNL, the variation in the chord length distribution and the total particle count corresponded very well with the slurry density data as determined using an in-line Promass 63 M Coriolis meter. Based on the performance results obtained, the Lasentec M 600 P FBRM is expected {{to meet the requirements}} for measuring the particle size distribution during the slurry transfer operations at Hanford and the Oak Ridge GAAT remediation project. The Red Valve pressure sensor was endorsed at the Hanford Site following instrument validation tests at PNNL and is currently in operation in the Tank 241 -C- 106 pump pit. While this instrument measures pressure within a transfer line, this type of pressure sensor could be configured to measure pressure drop over time. In turn, the status of a slurry transfer could be inferred from the pressure-drop measurement. In 1998, four Red Valve pressure sensors (with Sensotech Model AE- 213 pressure transducers) were installed before and after the booster pumps of the 4 -in. slurry (SL- 200) and supernatant (SN- 200) transfer lines between Tank 241 -C- 106 and Tank 241 -AY- 1 02. These pressure sensors have been in operation for over 1 year, and to date, the sensors have been trouble-flee according to the operators involved with slurry and supernatant transfer operations. Based on these observations, it is apparent that the Red Valve pressure sensors could be installed {{at the end of the}} <b>slurry</b> transfer <b>lines</b> and used to measure the pressure drop in the system...|$|R

The sedimentation (maximum static settled concentration) tests conducted on the two ash samples for the proposed HCSD systems (Pumping Station- 1 and Pumping Station- 2) indicated that the mixed ash sample for the Pumping Station- 1 can be transported at a higher solids concentration than that of Pumping Station- 2. The maximum static settled concentration (Cw-max) value of pumping station 1 and 2 were determined to be 68. 18 % and 68. 8 % respectively.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the research project during the first funding period was to develop an acoustic probe to measure volume percent solids in solid-liquid slurries {{in the presence of}} small amounts of gas bubbles. This problem was addressed because of the great need for a non-invasive, accurate and reliable method for solids monitoring in liquid slurries in the presence of radiolytically generated gases throughout the DOE complex. These measurements are necessary during mobilization of salts and sediments in tanks, transport of these <b>slurries</b> in transfer <b>lines</b> to processing facilities across a site, and, in some instances, during high level waste processing. Although acoustic probes have been commonly used for monitoring flows in single-phase fluids (McLeod, 1967), their application to monitor two-phase mixtures has not yet fully realized its potential. A number of investigators in recent years have therefore been involved in developing probes for measuring the volume fractions in liquid solid suspensions (Atkinson and Kytomaa, 1993; Greenwood et al., 1993; Martin et al., 1995) and in liquid-liquid suspensions (Bonnet and Tavlarides, 1987; Tavlarides and Bonnet, 1988, Yi and Tavlarides, 1990; Tsouris and Tavlarides, 1993, Tsouris et al., 1995). In particular, Atkinson and Kytomaa (1993) showed that the acoustic technique can be used to determine both the velocity and the volume fraction of solids while Martin et al. (1995) and Spelt et al. (1999) showed that the acoustic probe {{can also be used to}} obtain information on the size distribution of the particles. In a recent testing of in-line slurry monitors with radioactive slurries suspended with Pulsair Mixers (Hylton & Bayne, 1999), an acoustic probe did not compare well with other instruments most probably due to presence of entrained gases and improper acoustic frequency range of interrogation. The work of the investigators cited has established the potential of the acoustic probe for characterizing/monitoring two-phase flows in relatively ideal, well-characterized suspensions. Two major factors which we judge has prevented its wide-spread use in the processing industry, particularly for dilute suspensions, is careful selection of the frequency range for interrogation and quantification and removal of the noise introduced by bubbles from the acoustic signal obtained from the suspension. Our research during the first funding period to develop an acoustic probe for solid-gas liquid suspensions has resulted in a theory, supported by our experiments, to describe small amplitude dilute suspensions (Norato, 1999, Spelt et al., 1999, Spelt et al., 2001). The theory agrees well with experimental data of sound attenuation up to 45 {approx} 01 % suspensions of 0. 11 and 77 micron radius polystyrene particles in water and 0. 4 to 40 vol %, suspensions of 32 micron soda-lime glass particles in water. Also, analyses of our attenuation experiments for solid-gas liquid experiments suggest the theory can be applied to correct for signal interference due to the presence of bubbles over a selected frequency range to permit determination of the solid-liquid volume fraction. Further, we show experimentally that a reliable linear dependency of weight percent solids with attenuation is obtained for low weight fractions at high frequencies of interrogation where bubble interference is minimal. There was a collaborative effort during the first funding period with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratories in that Dr. Margaret Greenwood was a co-investigator on the project. Dr. Greenwood provided a high level of experimental knowledge and techniques on ultrasound propagation, measurement and data processing. During the second funding period the slurry test loop at Oak Ridge National Laboratories under the direction of Mr. Tom Hylton will be employed to demonstrate the measurement capabilities of the prototype acoustic monitor...|$|R
