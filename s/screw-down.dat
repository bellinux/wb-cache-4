25|$|Most {{cylinder}} valves {{are currently}} of the K-valve type, {{which is a}} simple manually operated <b>screw-down</b> on-off valve. In the mid-1960s, J-valves were widespread. J-valves contain a spring-operated valve that is restricts or shuts off flow when tank pressure falls to 300-500 psi, causing breathing resistance and warning the diver {{that he or she}} is dangerously low on air. The reserve air is released by pulling a reserve lever on the valve. J-valves fell out of favor with the introduction of pressure gauges, which allow divers to keep track of their air underwater, especially as the valve-type is vulnerable to accidental release of reserve air and increases the cost and servicing of the valve. J-valves are occasionally still used when work is done in visibility so poor that the pressure gauge cannot be seen, even with a light.|$|E
25|$|Before {{putting on}} the dry suit, the male diver puts on a condom catheter, {{which is similar to}} a condom except that it is made of thicker {{material}} with a cuff or adhesive ring to prevent it from slipping off, and its end connects to a built-on drain tube. After putting it on, he attaches the end of the tube to a drain hose in the crotch of the suit. This hose leads to a fitting through the front of one thigh of the suit, either with a <b>screw-down</b> outlet valve (P-valve), opened for use, or a non-return valve to prevent water from flowing back in if the hose gets disconnected. There may also be a non-return equalisation valve allowing gas from inside the suit to flow into the hose to avoid squeeze during descent The female diver puts on an external catching device {{in the form of a}} wide-rimmed, low-profile, elongated cup. The rim is affixed onto the skin surrounding the labia with medical grade glue. The cup's outlet connects to the drain hose with similar fitting on the suit.|$|E
2500|$|The {{chemical}} foam extinguisher {{was invented in}} 1904 by Aleksandr Loran in Russia, based on his previous invention of fire fighting foam. Loran first used it to extinguish a pan of burning naphtha. It worked and looked similar to the soda-acid type, but the inner parts were slightly different. The main tank contained a solution of sodium bicarbonate in water, whilst the inner container (somewhat larger than the equivalent in a soda-acid unit) contained a solution of aluminium sulphate. When the solutions were mixed, usually by inverting the unit, the two liquids reacted to create a frothy foam, and carbon dioxide gas. The gas expelled the foam {{in the form of}} a jet. Although liquorice-root extracts and similar compounds were used as additives (stabilizing the foam by reinforcing the bubble-walls), there was no [...] "foam compound" [...] in these units. The foam was a combination of the products of the chemical reactions: sodium and aluminium salt-gels inflated by the carbon dioxide. Because of this, the foam was discharged directly from the unit, with no need for an aspirating branchpipe (as in newer mechanical foam types). Special versions were made for rough service, and vehicle mounting, known as apparatus of fire department types. Key features were a <b>screw-down</b> stopper that kept the liquids from mixing until it was manually opened, carrying straps, a longer hose, and a shut-off nozzle. Fire department types were often private label versions of major brands, sold by apparatus manufacturers to match their vehicles. Examples are Pirsch, Ward LaFrance, Mack, Seagrave, etc. These types are some of the most collectible extinguishers as they cross into both the apparatus restoration and fire extinguisher areas of interest.|$|E

50|$|Most divers have a <b>screw-down</b> {{air control}} valve on the air hose to control air flow rate into the helmet. The early helmets did not have {{air control valve}}s and the diver {{signaled}} the surface with pulls on his rope or air line, indicating that he needed more or less air.|$|E

The 6238, 6239, 6241 and 6262 References were the first versions, {{and did not have}} the [...] "Oyster" [...] features of <b>screw-down</b> winding crown and <b>screw-down</b> timing buttons. The movement used was a manual wind Valjoux cal. 72, named the Rolex Cal. 722. The 6263, 6264 and 6265 References produced from 1970 were Oyster versions. The movement used remained based on the manual-wind Valjoux cal. 72, but with some refinements, and was called the Rolex Cal. 727. These Daytonas are very rare and very collectible. The movement has proven to be exceptionally reliable and accurate. In fact, the Cal. 727 was certified as a chronometer in some cases.|$|E

5000|$|The first <b>screw-down</b> tap {{mechanism}} was patented {{and manufactured}} by the Rotherham brass founders Guest and Chrimes in 1845. Most older taps use a soft rubber or neoprene washer which is screwed down onto a valve seat {{in order to}} stop the flow. This is called a [...] "globe valve" [...] in engineering and, while it gives a leak-proof seal and good fine adjustment of flow, both the rubber washer and the valve seat are subject to wear (and for the seat, also corrosion) over time, so that eventually no tight seal is formed in the closed position, resulting in a leaking tap. The washer can be replaced and the valve seat resurfaced (at least a few times), but globe valves are never maintenance-free.|$|E

50|$|Originally, {{the line}} cord and handset cord were secured by <b>screw-down</b> {{terminals}} at both ends, with a strain relief anchor. Both cords had matching colors, but most color sets initially were produced with neutral, dark gray cords, with {{exception of the}} ivory and brown sets. Starting in 1955, all sets, except dark blue were equipped with color-matched cords as dyes and manufacturing methods became stable. By 1973, line cords were changed to a neutral gray color and from a round to a flat cross-section. As a customer option, telephone sets could be ordered for portability with four-prong plugs, but most sets were hard-wired to wall connection boxes. In the 1970s, much smaller modular connectors were introduced for {{both ends of the}} line cord as well as the handset cord to facilitate standard connection methods for third-party equipment within the FCC registration system.|$|E

5000|$|Metal {{is one of}} the few {{materials}} that can be used for both pitched roofs and flat roofs. Flat or low-slope roofs can be covered with steel, aluminum, zinc, or copper just like pitched roofs. However, metal shingles are not practical for flat roofing and so roofers recommend standing-seam and <b>screw-down</b> metal panels. [...] While metal can be an expensive option in the short term, superior durability and simple maintenance of metal roofs typically saves money in the long term. A study by Ducker International in 2005 identified the average cost per year of a metal roof to be 30 cents/square foot while single-ply roofs stood at 57 cents and built-up roofing at 37 cents. [...] Metal roofs are also one of the most environmentally sound roofing options, with most metal roofing material already containing 30-60% recycled content, and the product itself being 100% recyclable. [...] The value of recyclable scrap metal can also provide a benefit to the homeowner; upon roof replacement, scrap metal from the old roof can be sold to recoup a potentially large share of original material costs.|$|E
5000|$|An iconic post {{military}} {{watch and}} {{a result of}} the Navy's FSX-797, colloquially known as the US Navy's Bureau of Ships [...] "canteen watch", started out with Jacques Depollier & Sons's waterproof and dustproof strap watch. The first known example of the now common [...] "screw down crown", unlike later examples of the canteen watch, this one lacked the emblematic chain anchoring the crown to the watch. One unusual feature of this watch was the heat disk {{on the back of the}} case to prevent the heat from the wearer's wrist from causing the oil in the watch to drip out of the jewel holes. Depollier ads claim that the US Army Signal Corps used the case to protect watch movement stores in long-term storage. The gasketed and spring-loaded <b>screw-down</b> crown is kept on the case by two flanges on the crown held against two grooves on the case.

40|$|Background—Fluid dynamic {{analysis}} predicts {{a new concept}} in coronary physiology that we call “branch steal, ” whereby stenosis proximal and distal to arterial branching interact with the nonstenotic branch between stenosis that shunts or “steals ” flow away from the distal stenotic artery during reactive hyperemia, tested experimentally. Methods and Results—In 21 large hounds under surgical anesthesia, proximal and distal left circumflex and obtuse marginal coronary arteries were instrumented with electromagnetic flowmeters, proximal and distal machined Teflon <b>screw-down</b> stenosers with round concentric closing and distal silk-in-tubing sleeve occluders. Baseline reactive hyperemia was recorded after 15 -second occlusions of both arteries at baseline and for progressive distal stenosis during each step of progressive proximal stenosis. At each combination of stenosis, a coronary arteriogram was obtained using left Judkins catheters and Philips cine calibrated with modulated transfer function to 0. 1 mm accuracy for fluid {{dynamic analysis}} of arterial stenosis-branching anatomy. In 324 experiments of parent-child stenosis combinations of the left circumflex artery with an intervening obtuse marginal branch, coronary flow reserve (CFR) calculated by the fluid dynamic model accounting for stenosis-branch interactions and “branch steal ” correlated with CFR directly measured by flowmeter (linear regression, CFRartgm 0. 180. 7 CFRflowmtr with Pearson r 0. 73). Quantitative arteriography and positron emission tomography perfusion imaging confirmed the concept in clinical examples.
