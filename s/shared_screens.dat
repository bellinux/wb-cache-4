40|$|While digital tables can be {{used with}} {{existing}} applications, they are typically limited by the one user per computer assumption of current operating systems. In this paper, we explore multimodal split view interaction – a tabletop whose surface is split into two adjacent projected views – that leverages how people can interact with three types of existing applications in this setting. Independent applications let people see and work on separate systems. <b>Shared</b> <b>screens</b> let people see a twinned view of a single user application. True groupware lets people work in parallel over large digital workspaces. Atop these, we add multimodal speech and gesture interaction capability to enhance interpersonal awareness during loosely coupled work. 1...|$|E

40|$|The wide {{adoption}} {{of small and}} powerful mobile computers, such as smart phones and tablets, has raised the opportunity to employ them in multi-user and multi-device iTV scenarios. In particular, the standardization of HTML 5 and the increase of cloud services have made the web browser a suitable tool for managing multimedia content and the user interface, {{in order to provide}} seamless session mobility among devices, such as smart phones, tablets and TV screens. In this paper we present an architecture and a prototype that let people transfer instantaneously the video they are watching between web devices. This architecture is based on two pillars: Websockets, a new HTML 5 feature, and Internet TV (Youtube, Yahoo Video, Vimeo, etc.). We demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed architecture in a prototype that employs the Youtube API and that facilitates seamless session mobility in a ubiquitous TV scenario. This flexible experimental set-up let us test several hypotheses, such as user attention and user behavior, in the presence of multiple users and multiple videos on personal and <b>shared</b> <b>screens...</b>|$|E
40|$|Our {{main purpose}} was to explore how {{teenagers}} used mobile face-to-face collaborative computer games. In this report we therefore describe the {{development and use of}} what we call mobile face-to-face collaborative computer games. These games are played among co-located people on a handheld devices connected in an ad hoc network. The research was conducted in three phases: the workshop phase, the development phase and finally the evaluation phase. In the first phase we studied three traditional games, both on a theoretical level and empirically. The aim was to identify the design patterns that made people collaborate and interact face-to-face. The workshops resulted in three collaborative design patterns; the multiple keys pattern, the <b>shared</b> <b>screens</b> pattern and the guide-and-follow pattern. During the development phase we selected three famous computer games: Pac-man, Tetris and Asteroids. These games were then redesigned to incorporate one of the collaborative design patterns each. During the evaluation phase we studied teenagers at a local high school cafeteria play these games during a period of two weeks. Our evaluation showed that the developed computer games generate collaboration and interaction among the co-located gamers. Teenagers also seem to enjoy playing this type of computer games and used a trial-and-error approach when learning how to play. The games will soon be available for free download on the web...|$|E
