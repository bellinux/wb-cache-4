H. zebra is distinguishable as a white fish with oblique, black stripes that extend from behind the head into the tail, with an obvious E turned <b>sidesways</b> on its nose. H. furunculus appears rather similar to H. zebra, {{but it has a}} creamier color (rather than white) and it only has one oblique stripe rather than many. H. furunculus and H. debilittera both have vertical stripes on the caudal fin. However, H. debilittera has a dark base color and white spots, bands, and vermiculations with an either weakly formed or absent E on the nose. In H. inspector, there are smaller spots on the head and larger spots on the body, and some of the spots on the upper caudal fin will join together and form bands. If the dorsal fin of H. inspector is pushed down, the dorsal fin does not reach the adipose fin, in contrast to both H. contradens and H. lunaorum. H. lunaorum has very small, gold spots dotting its body and, if present, the spots on the head will be of the same size. H. contradens has white or pink, similarly-sized spots large that do not connect to form bands. H. margaritatus is distinguished from all congeners by its color pattern of dense, small, light-colored spots on a dark base color and H. phantasma can be distinguished from congeners by a color pattern consisting of a tan base coloration with black spots.|$|R

Constitutive material models of concrete and steel for fibre elements are adopted to enable simulation of the loss in vertical load carrying capacity of structural columns. Inclusion of the nonlinear second order −Δ effects accelerated by degrading behaviour of steel and concrete materials in the fibre model allows prediction of the <b>sidesway</b> mode of collapse. The model is compared with nonlinear lumped plasticity models in which stiffness and strength degradation is replicated through degrading parameters in structural components. Static cyclic analyses of an example cantilever column and a portal frame indicate that the variation of axial loads in columns may result in accelerated degradation and failure of structural components which is not taken into account by lumped plasticity models. Moreover, incremental dynamic analysis of a ten-storey RC frame shows that the lumped plasticity model may overestimate building collapse capacity when vertical failure of structural components occurs prior to <b>sidesway</b> instability...|$|E

Also sensitivity studies and several examples are presented in detail that demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed closed-form equations and the importance of initial imperfections, semirigid connections and lateral bracing on the second-order behavior and stability of beam-columns.

40|$|Present {{approximate}} second order {{methods for}} the analysis of unbraced multistorey frames may significantly underestimate moments in single curvature regions. To clarify reasons for this that may not be well understood, the mechanics of column interaction in single curvature regions are studied. Suitable tools for <b>sidesway</b> description are derived, including a nearly exact, explicit free-sway effective length expression, that, when high accuracy is required, eliminates the need for cumbersome, iterative solutions of exact effective lengths from the transcendental instability equation. Two reasons for the underestimation are identified. One is related to the local second order "N-delta" effects, and the other to second order effects causing changes in rotational restraint stiffness at column ends due to vertical, inter-storey column interaction. A modified approximate storey magnifier approach is proposed that accounts for these local second order effects through two separate "flexibility factors". The approach is sufficiently simple to be viable in practical analyses, and predictions are found to compare well with more accurate results...|$|E

40|$|Progressive {{collapse}} {{occurs when}} damage from a localized first failure spreads in a domino effect manner {{resulting in a}} total damage disproportionate to the initial failure. Recent building failures (e. g., World Trade Center twin towers) highlight the catastrophic outcome of progressive collapse. This research proposes a reliable and realistic retrofit technology which installs thin steel panels into steel building structural frames to enhance the system progressive collapse resistance. The steel frames with simple beam-to-column connections, under different boundary conditions (i. e., <b>sidesway</b> uninhibited and <b>sidesway</b> inhibited, respectively), and the loss of one bottom story column were retrofitted using the proposed technology (i. e. installing thin steel panels in the structural frames). Performance of these frames was investigated. Two Finite Element (FE) models which require different modeling efforts were developed to capture the system behavior. The first model explicitly models the infill plates to capture the plate buckling behavior. The second model known as strip model represents the infill panels as diagonal strips. In addition to the FE models, a plastic analysis model derived from the prior research on seismically designed Steel Plate Shear Walls (SPSWs) was considered. The system progressive collapse resistance obtained from the two FE models and the plastic analysis procedure were compared and good agreements were observed. It was observed that installing infill plates to steel structural frames can be an effective approach for enhancing the system progressive collapse resistance. Beyond the strength of the overall system, the Dynamic Increase Factor (DIF) which may be used to amplify the static force on the system to better capture the dynamic nature of progressive collapse demand was evaluated for the retrofitted system. Furthermore, the demands including axial force, shear force and bending moment on individual frame components (i. e., beams and columns) in the retrofitted system were quantified via the nonlinear FE models and a simplified procedure based on free body diagrams (FBDs). Finally, the impact of premature beam-to-column connection failures on the system performance was investigated and it was observed that the retrofitted system is able to provide stable resistance even when connection failures occur in all beams...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of collapse of tall steel moment-frame buildings is explored through three-dimensional nonlinear analyses of two 18 -story steel moment-frame buildings under earthquake excitation. Both fracture-susceptible and perfect-connection conditions are investigated. Classical energy-balance analysis shows that only long-period excitation imparts energy to tall buildings {{large enough to}} cause collapse. Under such long-period motion, the shear-beam analogy alludes {{to the existence of}} a characteristic {{mechanism of}} collapse or a few preferred mechanisms of collapse for these buildings. Numerical evidence from parametric analyses of the buildings under a suite of idealized sawtooth-like ground-motion time histories, with varying period (T), amplitude (peak ground velocity, PGV), and duration (number of cycles, N), is presented to support this hypothesis. Damage localizes to form a quasi-shear band over a few stories. When the band is destabilized, <b>sidesway</b> collapse is initiated, and gravity takes over. Only one to five collapse mechanisms occur out of a possible 153 mechanisms in either principal direction of the buildings considered. Where two or more preferred mechanisms do exist, they have significant story-overlap, typically separated by just 1 story. It is shown that a simple work-energy relation applied to all possible quasi-shear bands combined with plastic analysis principles can systematically identify all the preferred collapse mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Parameters (Lp and Lr) for LRFD (1993, 1999) and AISC (2005, 2010) {{have been}} studied. This study has {{explored}} major fundamental equations {{regarding to the}} flexural design of steel beam based on the AISC (2005, 2010). Various beam sections, which are double symmetric I-shaped with compact webs and noncompact or slender flanges, and other I-shaped members with compact or noncompact webs, were investigated. The various failure modes involved in beams were discussed. They are elastic, inelastic and plastic modes for the lateral-torsional buckling of beams. The current AISC specifications provide no theoretical formulas for the elastic critical moment of WC section, but do give the approximate formulas which were actually derived from a singly symmetric I-shaped section as briefly described in this study. Based on this study, the AISC approximate formulas underestimate the elastic critical moments of WC section. It again thoroughly discusses of theoretical elastic moment for built-up crane runway girders. The difficulty comes {{from some of the}} evaluation of torsion properties including the warping constant (Cw) and coefficient of monosymmetry (βx), the torsion constant (J). This new set of design parameters and properties for WC section will enable practicing engineers to perform more in-depth evaluation in their routine deigns. The formulas for beam webs and flanges with concentrated loads are also introduced and investigated in this study. These include the flange local bending, the web local yielding, the web crippling, and the web <b>sidesway</b> buckling. 本研究比較撓曲設計參數（Lp, Lr）在LRFD (1993, 1999) 與AISC (2005, 2010) 之間的差異。整合介紹AISC (2005, 2010) 之鋼樑構件撓曲設計之方程式和基本背景:包含有雙對稱I-型結實斷面、非結實斷面與細長斷面，其它I-型結實斷面與非結實斷面。在側向扭曲挫曲的情況下，提出雙對稱I-型結實斷面與非結實斷面的例子，分析彈性、非彈性與塑性的行為。 因為現有設計規範沒有提供適當公式作為計算彎矩強度，僅以雙對稱I-型樑以及單對稱I-型樑相關之簡化公式評估單對稱斷面之彈性彎矩強度。所以進一步探討單對稱鋼樑斷面的彎矩強度，評估WC斷面理論強度時，必須計算翹曲常數Cw、單對稱係數以及扭力常數J。因為翹曲常數Cw、單對稱係數以及扭力常數J等牽涉到複雜積分運算。所以本研究提供常見WC 斷面之翹曲常數Cw、單對稱係數、扭力常數J以及設計相關表值。進而評估現有規範與理論值之差異。最後在針對集中荷重在梁的翼板與腹板時，分別有flange local bending、web local yielding、web crippling與web <b>sidesway</b> buckling四種狀態下分別進行討論，並整理相關規範與例題。Table of Contents Abstract………………………………………………………………… [...] .

40|$|With {{the greater}} {{availability}} and affordability of high-strength concrete, designers {{have been able}} to reduce concrete column cross-sections, leading to in an increase in the prevalence of slender columns in building construction. In spite of this trend, provisions for the design of slender columns have not changed significantly since the provisions were first introduced 1971. Improved understanding of as well as improved design provisions for slender, concrete columns can allow for further use while maintaining safety. The objective of this research is to better understand the behavior and limits of slender, concrete columns and, from the results, develop improved design procedures for incorporation into building codes. The research program consisted of experimental testing coupled with computational modeling. The experimental testing was designed to expand the boundaries of practical column design while maintaining realistic service conditions. Additionally, the columns tests were designed to simulate theoretical conditions, which correspond better to code provisions and simplified computational analysis. The columns were tested with equal end eccentricities, braced against <b>sidesway,</b> and used pinned-pinned loading conditions. A computational model was further developed from a previous study. It incorporated commonly assumed material properties, simple mechanics, and structural analysis. The results of the experimental tests were used to evaluate and calibrate the computational model. With increased confidence, the computational model was used to develop design methods through analysis and parametric evaluation. Based on the results, design equations and recommendations are recommended for the short-term and long-term loading of nonprestressed and prestressed, slender, concrete columns. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} the {{strength}} and behaviour of model reinforced concrete structures subjected to simulated seismic disturbances are examined. The performance of a closed loop electrohydraulic testing system {{used in conjunction with}} a small shaking table is described. This testing system could accurately reproduce seismic disturbances and was used in the testing of a single storey structure and two six storey structures. All structures had a single bay in each direction and they were approximately one fifth of full size. The problems associated with modelling work are discussed and techniques suitable for constructing small scale three-dimensional model reinforced concrete structures are reported. Loading tests were conducted on typical beam and column structural members and the moment-curvature curves obtained are compared with those determined using theoretical methods. Both static and dynamic cyclic lateral loading tests were conducted on the structures and the apparent strengths of the structures under each type of loading are compared. The accuracy of an existing frame analysis program in predicting the displacement response of the model structures to simulated seismic disturbances is discussed and the more important parameters affecting the response are investigated. The experiments revealed that under lateral loading considerable torsion is induced into the lateral beams and that this may be sufficient to cause failure of those beams. A method is presented for calculating the distribution of torsion induced in the lateral beams and for calculating the magnitude of the torsional contribution to the flexural strength of the longitudinal beams. A discussion on collapse mechanisms is included and a design recommendation is made to reduce the likelihood of the structure collapsing by a column <b>sidesway</b> mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} truss sign support {{structures}} {{is based on}} the guidelines provided by American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Standard Specifications for Highway Signs, Luminaries and Traffic Signals and the American Institute of Steel Construction Design Specifications. Using these specifications, the column design strength is normally determined using the effective length approach. This approach does not always accurately address all issues associated with frame stability, including the actual end conditions of the individual members, variations of the loads in the members, and the resulting <b>sidesway</b> buckling for truss type sign support structures. This research provides insight into the problems with the simplified design approach for determining the effective lengths, discusses different approaches for overcoming these simplifications and presents an approach {{that can be used to}} better predict the design strength of truss sign support structures. ^ Structural condition assessment is often best made with probabilistic based methods. This is done by replacing the structural system with a reliability based model, based on the different possible failure nodes. The system model is then used to determine the failure probability. The study in this report illustrates the procedure needed to conduct a systems reliability analysis for highway truss sign supports. The procedure provides a method to update the resistance strength as the structure deteriorates. In this way, the structural reliability can be computed at different stages in the life span of the structure. This report discusses the minimum acceptable failure risk for the highway sip support structure based on a systems reliability model. The results of the study demonstrate how changes should be made in the structure as it ages to insure structure safety. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{behavior}} of two tall steel moment frame buildings and their variants under strong earthquake ground shaking through parametric analysis using idealized ground motion waveforms. Both fracture-susceptible as well as perfect-connection conditions are investigated. Ground motion velocity waveforms are parameterized using triangular (sawtooth-like) wave-trains with a characteristic period (T), amplitude(peak ground velocity, PGV), and duration (number of cycles, N). This idealized representation has the desirable feature that {{the response of the}} target buildings under the idealized waveforms closely mimics their response under the emulated true ground motion waveforms. A suite of nonlinear analyses are performed on four tall building models subjected to these idealized wave-trains, with T varying from 0. 5 s to 6. 0 s, PGV varying from 0. 125 m/s to 2. 5 m/s, and N taking the values of 1 to 5, and 10. This range of parameters should be adequate to characterize the ground motions that can be expected to occur during earthquakes in the 6 - 8 magnitude range at some distance (say, > 2 km) away from the fault. Databases of peak transient and residual interstory drift ratio (IDR), and permanent roof drift are created for each model. The sensitivity of structural response to T, PGV, and N is studied. Severe dynamic response is induced only in the long-period, large-amplitude excitation regime. Through a simple examination of the energy balance during earthquake shaking, it can be shown that the input excitation energy is small for excitation with periods shorter than the structural period, whereas it is proportional to the square of the ground velocity if the excitation periods are much longer than the structural periods. Thus, collapse-level response can be induced only by long-period, moderate to large PGV ground excitation. The collapse initiation regime expands to lower ground motion periods and amplitudes with increasing number of ground motion cycles. It {{should be noted that the}} energy balance analysis is not appropriate for excitation velocities that are extreme where conservation of momentum may be more applicable. However, peak ground velocity from earthquakes seldom exceeds 2. 5 m/s and energy balance would generally be applicable. The close examination of one instance of collapse shows damage (yielding and/or fracture) localizing in a few stories in the form of a "quasi-shear" band (QSB) comprising of plastic hinges at the top of all columns in the uppermost story of the band, at the bottom of all columns in the lowermost story of the band, and at both ends of all beams in the intermediate stories. Such a pattern of hinging results in shear-like deformation in these stories, resembling plastic shear bands in ductile solids. Most of the lateral deformation due to seismic shaking is concentrated in this band. When the overturning 1 st-order and 2 nd-order (P -) moments from the inertia of the overriding block of stories exceed the moment-carrying capacity of the quasi-shear band, it loses stability and collapses. This initiates gravity-driven progressive collapse of the overriding block of stories. Thus, the collapse mechanism initiates as a <b>sidesway</b> mechanism that is taken over by gravity once the quasi-shear band is destabilized. There are Ns(Ns+ 1) 2 possible quasi-shear bands (and an equal number of <b>sidesway</b> collapse mechanisms) in either principal direction of an Ns-story moment frame building. More than one quasi-shear bands could occur during the entire duration of strong earthquake shaking. The band exhibiting the greatest distress (termed the "primary" quasi-shear band) iv ultimately evolves into a <b>sidesway</b> collapse mechanism. The formation of the quasi-shear band under single-cycle excitations is explained through the classical uniform shear-beam analogy to moment frame buildings. Under low-intensity motions (PGV 1. 5 m/s) that are sufficiently long-period, the pulse may yield the structure on its way up the building. The strength of the building drops as the pulse travels up the building. However, inertial forces drop as well, as a result of fewer stories above contributing to the mass. The narrow band of stories with an optimal combination of low-enough strength and high-enough inertial force demand is where peak yielding occurs. This region is identical to the region where the downward migration of the primary quasi-shear band is arrested under moderate-intensity, long-period excitation. This is because the governing factor dictating the location of the band in both cases is strength non-uniformity. As the wave travels up the building, it is reflected off the roof with a change in sign. Because the period of the incident wave is sufficiently long (a necessary condition for large input excitation energy), the reverse phase of the incident pulse constructively interferes with the reflected forward phase causing greatest yielding in the same region as the pre-reflection yielding. To summarize, under both moderate-intensity and highintensity ground motions, input excitation energy large enough to collapse the building requires long-period excitation. Such long-period excitation always causes the formation of the primary quasi-shear band in an optimal set of stories governed by the mass and strength distribution of the building over its height, which are characteristics solely of the structure and not the ground motion. When T and PGV are large enough, it is this band that evolves into a collapse mechanism. This points to the existence of a "characteristic" collapse mechanism or only a few preferred collapse mechanisms (out of the Ns(Ns+ 1) 2 possible mechanisms) in either principal direction of the building. If multiple preferred collapse mechanisms exist, they would be clustered together with significant story-overlap amongst them. The simulations of the four models under idealized ground motion waveforms where collapse occurs do not show the formation of a single (unique) collapse mechanism. However, in each model only one to five v collapse mechanisms occur out of a possible 153 mechanisms in each principal direction of the building. Furthermore, if two or more preferred mechanisms do exist, they have significant story-overlap, typically separated by just one story. For example, the strongly preferred collapse mechanisms in the existing building model (perfect connections) under X direction excitation occur between floors 3 and 9, and floors 4 and 9, while the weakly preferred mechanisms occur between floors 3 and 8, and floors 4 and 8 (four preferred mechanisms out of 153 possible mechanisms, all clustered together within a narrow story zone; two of these mechanisms are in fact a subset of the other two mechanisms). The characteristic and/or preferred collapse mechanisms can be identified by applying the Principle of Virtual Work to all possible quasi-shear bands in a building. Based on plastic analysis principles, the band that is destabilized by the smallest acceleration of the over-riding block of stories is the characteristic collapse mechanism. If one or more bands exist that have destabilizing accelerations close to that of the characteristic collapse band, say within 5...|$|E
40|$|Beam-columns, {{which are}} {{subjected}} to axial forces and bending moments simultaneously, will withstand a big axial force caused by a flexural deformation and result in adverse changes in the axial force and end moment. In order {{to ensure the safety}} of beam-columns, you must go through a rational analysis to assess its safety. Since the nature of beam-column is subject to axial force and bending moment, the second-order effects must be considered reasonably. This study use the theorems and formulas based on the AISC (1999) the AISC (2005) and the AISC (2010) to explore the evolution and safety considerations of current AISC beam-column design. Based on the past researches, we can further realize which limitations the AISC Specification would put on the beam-columns. In the aspect of analysis, the parameters (B 1, B 2) related to the first order and second order moments, as well as the axial forces parameters (Pnt, Plt, Pe 1, Pe 2) related to <b>sidesway</b> and nonsidesway have been fully reviewed and discussed. In the design aspect, this study summarizes a design method that makes the analysis more effectively and reasonably. Many illustrated examples are also furnished to demonstrate the beam-column related analysis and design and to provide more rational deign methods for the consulting engineers. 梁柱構件係指同時受到軸力和彎矩作用之構件，在結構系統中梁柱構件會因承受巨大軸力致產生撓曲變形造成在軸力和端點彎矩上之不利變化。為了確保構件的安全，必須使用較合理的分析去評估其安全性。由於梁柱同受到軸力和彎矩的特性，因此梁柱構件的二次效應(非線性行為) 必須給予合理考慮。本研究針對AISC (1999) 、AISC (2005) 、AISC (2010) 提供公式，探討梁柱構件的演進與評估方法，根據過去的研究了解 AISC 對梁柱的使用與限制。在分析上，對一次彎矩和二次彎矩的相關係數(B 1, B 2) 以及對有側位移和無側位移的相關參數(Pnt, Plt, Pe 1, Pe 2) 做了完整的探討與討論。在設計上，本研究中依據過去研究成果整理提供了較快速、合理的設計方法，使得分析工作能在有限時間內做更有效的分析。本研究提供相當數量例題以說明AISC之分析與設計，提供業界工程師設計參考。Abstract in English	 [...] . i Abstract in Chinese / 摘要 [...] ii Table of Contents [...] iii Figures List [...] . v Symbols [...] vi Chapter 1 Introduction [...] 1 1. 1 Background [...] . 1 1. 2 Previous studies [...] . 1 	 1. 3 Objectives [...] . 2 Chapter 2 Theory and Practice of Beam-Column Members [...] 3 2. 1 Beam-columns in braced frames [...] 3 2. 1. 1 Schematic diagrams and formulas for braced frames [...] 3 2. 1. 2 The moment magnification factor B 1 [...] . 5 2. 1. 3 The coefficient Cm for beam-columns [...] 7 2. 1. 4 Beam-columns with end moments only [...] 10 2. 2 Beam-columns in unbraced frames [...] . 12 2. 2. 1 Schematic diagrams and formulas for unbraced frames [...] 12 2. 2. 2 The moment magnification factor B 2 [...] 14 2. 3 Proposed method of equivalent axial loads for LRFD [...] 16 Chapter 3 Beam-Columns Provisions on 1999, 2005 and 2010 AISC [...] . 23 3. 1 Formula commentary of beam-columns based on AISC specification [...] . 23 3. 2 The effective length method [...] . 27 3. 3 The direct analysis method [...] 29 3. 4 Comparison between ELM and DAM based on 2005 AISC [...] . 30 3. 5 Summary of formulas based on 1999 - 2010 AISC specifications [...] 31 3. 6 Procedure for beam-columns analysis and design / 2005 AISC [...] 34 Chapter 4 Illustrated Examples [...] . 35 Chapter 5 Conclusions [...] 71 References [...] 72 Appendices [...] 74 Appendix A : Derivation of centroid [...] . 74 Appendix B : Unequal end moments - no transverse load [...] . 75 Appendix C : Accuracy of replacing Sec(λL/ 2) with 1 /(1 -α) [...] . 77 Appendix D : Definition and derivation of Δ 2 [...] . 78 Appendix E : Definition and derivation of B 2 [...] 78 Appendix F : Values of m* by equivalent axial load method (1986) and Values of m and U by equivalent axial load method (1994) [...] . 81 Appendix G: Amplification coefficient Cm [...] 8...|$|E
