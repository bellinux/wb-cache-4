40|$|The {{first step}} in {{establishing}} a pavement management system (PMS) is <b>road</b> <b>network</b> identification. An important feature of a PMS {{is the ability to}} determine the current condition of a <b>road</b> <b>network</b> and predict its future condition. Pavement condition evaluation may involve structure, roughness, surface distress, and safety evaluation. In this study, a pavement distress condition rating procedure was used to achieve the objectives of this study. The main objectives of this study were to identify the common types of distress that exist on the Jazan <b>road</b> <b>network</b> (JRN), either on main <b>roads</b> or <b>secondary</b> <b>roads,</b> and to evaluate the pavement condition based on network level inspection. The study was conducted by collecting pavement distress types from 227 sample units on main roads and 500 sample units from <b>secondary</b> <b>roads.</b> Data were examined through analysis of common types of distress identified in both main and <b>secondary</b> <b>roads.</b> Through these data, pavement condition index (PCI) for each sample unit was then calculated. Through these calculations, average PCIs for the main and <b>secondary</b> <b>roads</b> were determined. Results indicated that the most common pavement distress types on main roads were patching and utility cut patching, longitudinal and transverse cracking, polished aggregate, weathering and raveling, and alligator cracking. The most common pavement distress types on <b>secondary</b> <b>roads</b> were weathering and raveling, patching and utility cut patching, longitudinal and transverse cracking, potholes, and alligator cracking. The results also indicated that 65 % of Jazan's main <b>road</b> <b>network</b> has an average pavement condition rating of very good while only 30 % of Jazan's <b>secondary</b> <b>roads</b> <b>network</b> has an average pavement condition...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} extracting main and <b>secondary</b> <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> in dense urban areas from very high resolution (VHR, ~ 0. 61 m) satellite images. The difficulty with <b>secondary</b> <b>roads</b> lies in the low discriminative power of the grey-level distributions of road regions and the background, and the greater effect of occlusions and other noise on narrower roads. To tackle this problem, we use a previously developed higher-order active contour (HOAC) phase field model and augment it with an additional non-linear non-local term. The additional term allows separate control of road width and road curvature; thus more precise prior knowledge can be incorporated, and better road prolongation can be achieved for the same width. Promising results on QuickBird panchromatic images at reduced resolutions and comparisons with other models demonstrate the role and the efficiency of our new model. 1...|$|R
30|$|The Directive {{is applied}} to TEN roads, mainly multi-lane {{arterial}} roads. Its use for minor roads is encouraged but not mandatory, and the application schedule is locally variable. For example, in Italy, the Directive has been transposed into legislative decree in 2011 [24] and into National Guidelines in 2012 [25]. It should be applied to TEN roads, and after 2016, to <b>secondary</b> <b>road</b> <b>networks.</b> However, the Directive does not indicate clear methods for quantifying both safety problems and possible countermeasure-related benefits. In detail, SPFs are not explicitly recommended. This is a crucial matter, since they could be potentially integrated in assessments, audits, rankings. Therefore, for EU countries (for example Italy), local Regulations should be integrated with other methods, providing quantitative road safety performance indications.|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{a robust}} <b>roads</b> <b>network</b> on bicycle traffic; Results {{obtained}} from a microsimulation model. The traffic flow on the Dutch main <b>road</b> <b>network</b> is problematic due to intensive use and near stagnant capacity. As a result the accessibility of the economic centres is still under heavy pressure. In 2008, the Royal Dutch Touring Club ANWB made public its vision on the <b>road</b> <b>network.</b> This vision, known as the Robust <b>roads</b> <b>network</b> {{is intended to be}} the answer to the increasing vulnerability of the present <b>road</b> <b>network</b> for disturbances of the traffic flow. SWOV, together with ANWB, carried out a pilot study into the safety effects of a robust <b>roads</b> <b>network.</b> This pilot study found relatively small differences between the Sustainable Safety vision and the Robust <b>roads</b> <b>network,</b> for both traffic flow and road safety. It seems feasible to integrate the two visions into a system that offers a larger traffic flow {{and at the same time}} provides optimal safety. The pilot study did not yet answer the question of which effects a robust <b>roads</b> <b>network</b> would have on bicycle traffic. At the same time, however, motorized through traffic will (incidentally) make more use of the <b>secondary</b> <b>roads</b> <b>network</b> and at those locations interfere with bicycle traffic. The present report, therefore, has attempted to find answers to the following questions: 1. Which effects on road safety are to be expected when robust <b>roads</b> <b>networks</b> are introduced? 2. Can these effects be quantified? 3. Which measures can be taken to prevent possible adverse consequences? The effects of a robust <b>roads</b> <b>network</b> on bicycle traffic has been investigated with the microsimulation model S-Paramics. In this model a <b>road</b> <b>network</b> was simulated in which part of the car traffic made use of the <b>secondary</b> <b>roads</b> after an incident had occurred on the main <b>roads</b> <b>network.</b> An intersecting bicycle path was simulated at one of the <b>secondary</b> <b>roads.</b> This gives an impression of the hindrance (flow, safety) that bicycle traffic can experience at intersections when the car traffic uses the <b>secondary</b> <b>roads</b> as an alternative. The microsimulation model does not (yet) have the possibility of simulating the hindrance cyclists may experience at road sections. The present study has established that the greatest effects on traffic flow may be observed at intersections with priority for car traffic. At this type of intersection, bicycle traffic flow is obstructed when car traffic uses <b>secondary</b> <b>roads</b> as an alternative. There are no adverse road safety effects at this intersection type. Adverse safety effects do indeed occur at intersections with priority for cyclists. This type of intersection enables good traffic flow for cyclists despite the increase in car traffic (due to the incident on the motorway). The intersection with traffic light control achieves good flow as well as safety for both bicycle and car. It must be noted, however, that the simulation model underestimates the dangers at this intersection type, as, other than in reality, the model does not allow for going through a red light...|$|R
40|$|This report {{serves as}} a {{guideline}} for testing the effects of telematic systems on road safety. The report discusses which safety effects {{must be taken into}} account, at which stages of the system development, and in which phase of the traffic process. The report identifies the following phases: systems development; experimental application; and large-scale application. The report also distinguishes between safety effects relating to: mobility; traffic flow; traffic behaviour; the driving task; and to the accident level. The report also produces standard forms for the assessment of specific telematic systems on road safety, both during the development phase and during the experimental testing. The annexes to the report contain various examples of the application of a road safety analysis based on standard forms. These examples include: a `prospective' analysis of `Intelligent Cruise Control' (ICC) systems, aimed at the development phase of the system; and `retrospective' analyses, aimed at the experimental application of `Incident Warning Systems' (IWS).

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{an analysis}} of the environmental impacts of policy proposals taken up in the new Dutch National Transport Policy Document for improvement of accessibility and reliability of the main motorway network in the Netherlands. Major conclusions drawn from this analysis are that pricing policies proposed in the policy document effectively improve accessibility and reduce environmental impacts due to road traffic. The size of environmental benefits of the proposed kilometre charge, however, is determined by the final design of the policy measure. Furthermore, the policy document proposes secondary road expansion be state-funded if this would mean a contribution to reducing congestion on the main motorway network. However, before state-funding is decided, more research on {{the costs and benefits of}} <b>secondary</b> <b>road</b> <b>network</b> expansion is necessary, including the transfer of environmental and social problems from the main motorway network to the <b>secondary</b> <b>road</b> <b>network.</b> Furthermore, it would seem important to have local and regional authorities pay attention to noise hotspots in their transport policy development, since without additional measures, the number of noise hotspots along secondary roads will sharply increase. Finally, further research on giving priority to infrastructure projects within the proposed infrastructure investment in combination with pricing policies packages is recommended. Combinations of pricing and expanding existing infrastructure may reduce the need to construct new motorway links, reduce negative impacts on nature conservation areas and rural landscapes, and result in higher net economic benefits...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a novel analysis of accident data on Ireland’s National <b>Secondary</b> <b>Road</b> <b>network.</b> This is a national network of single-carriageway A-roads. The results challenge the conventionally-held belief that a better-designed road is a safer road [...] Single-carriageway A-roads in rural areas are among the most dangerous routes on the network. Alongside journey time savings, safety improvements are therefore one of the main benefits claimed to result from quality improvements to rural single-carriageway roads. Existing appraisal methods support the engineers ’ natural conviction that a better-designed road is a safer road. However, this contrasts with anecdotal evidence that as speeds and traffic flows increase, so does the likelihood of a fatal accident. This paper examines the safety issue in more detail and presents a novel analysis of accident data on the National <b>Secondary</b> <b>Road</b> <b>network</b> in Ireland. The Irish national secondary network consists of 2, 700 km of single-carriageway A-roads, complementing the national primary routes. The context is similar to Scotland – the two countries face similar challenges of accessibility to peripheral rural areas. For this analysis, the 34 National Secondary routes have been broken up into 850 sections, each with a road quality score based on bendiness, carriageway width and gradient. Econometric analysis of accident rates and types by road quality identifies a number of interesting characteristics. As road quality improves, the overall accident rate falls. But the likelihood of a fatal accident increases, up to a certain threshold, before it begins to fall. This more accurate modelling of accident rates leads to a situation where road quality improvements can result in an increase in the economic cost of accidents, with major implications for cost-benefit analysis of rural road improvement schemes. © PTRC and Contributors 2010...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an analysis of the position and density of a <b>secondary</b> <b>road</b> <b>network</b> in the group-selection management system. The research was conducted in the economic unit Prosara in the north west of the Republic of Srpska. The network of skid roads in the analyzed sections was recorded using the GPS devices Garmin GPS 60 and Garmin Map 62 st, and the analysis software package used was ESRI ArcInfo 10. 1. Adhering to the general guidelines, the slope of skid roads was analyzed within six predefined intervals: 0 - 12 %, 12 - 16 %, 16 - 20 %, 20 - 30 %, 30 - 40 % and over 40 %. Relative openness with a <b>secondary</b> <b>road</b> <b>network</b> was determined for a maximum distance between the skid roads of 130 m and it ranged from 82. 62 % to 96. 37 %. Such openness was classified as very good and excellent. Together with all factors related to stand and terrain characteristics, it appears that in all the compartments, the density of the secondary network of skid roads is adequate for the application of a skidder with a winch, without extending above the maximum length of the winch rope. Out of the total length of analyzed skid roads, 24 % is within an appropriate slope interval for a planned conversion to truck roads, whereas 37 % is the maximum slope from the ecological point of view. The average terrain slope for the whole analyzed area is 26. 4 %. Such moderately sloping terrain is suitable for the construction of skid roads with low investment and small environmental impact. Due to their specific configuration, the main skid roads were designed along the ridge, while the secondary and tertiary skid roads most often separated from them at the maximum slope, forming an irregular fish bone shape...|$|E

The largest transport cost decrease of the period under consideration took place during the three decades between 1855 and the great depression of the late nineteenth century, through the substitution of the railroad for the traditional transport means in the main routes of the country, as well as through the gradual reduction of the price of railway transport.
