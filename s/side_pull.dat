25|$|Undercuts on molded {{parts are}} {{features}} that prevent the part from being directly ejected from an injection molding machine. They are categorized into {{internal and external}} undercuts, where external undercuts are on {{the exterior of the}} part and interior undercuts are {{on the inside of the}} part. Undercuts can still be molded, but require a side action or <b>side</b> <b>pull.</b> This is an extra part of the mold that moves separately from the two halves. These can increase the cost of the molded part due to an added 15 to 30% cost of the mold itself and added complexity of the molding machine.|$|E

50|$|Lewington {{received}} his second red card {{of the season}} in a 5-0 league defeat to Cheltenham Town on 18 February 2012, a result which sent the Daggers {{to the bottom of the}} League Two table. Dagenham were two goals down when Lewington was sent off for handling the ball outside of the box after 41 minutes. John Still appealed the red card but the decision was upheld with Lewington forced to serve a two-game ban. On his return to action, Lewington helped his <b>side</b> <b>pull</b> away from the relegation zone, including a penalty save in a crucial 1-0 away win at Port Vale on 31 March. The performance earned him a spot in the League Two 'Team of the Week', alongside goalscorer in the game Michael Spillane. With the side securing League Two safety for another season, Lewington ended the campaign with a total of 47 appearances in all competitions.|$|E
40|$|Sodium cyanide poison is {{potentially}} a more humane method to control wild dogs than sodium fluoroacetate (1080) poison. This study quantified the clinical signs {{and duration of}} cyanide toxicosis delivered by the M- 44 ejector. The device delivered a nominal 0. 88 g of sodium cyanide, which caused the animal to loose the menace reflex in a mean of 43 s, and the animal was assumed to have undergone cerebral hypoxia after the last visible breath. The mean time to cerebral hypoxia was 156 s for a vertical pull and 434 s for a <b>side</b> <b>pull.</b> The difference was possibly because some cyanide may be lost in a <b>side</b> <b>pull.</b> There were three distinct phases of cyanide toxicosis: the initial phase was characterised by head shaking, panting and salivation; the immobilisation phase by incontinence, ataxia and loss of the righting reflex; and the cerebral hypoxia phase by a tetanic seizure. Clinical signs that were exhibited {{in more than one}} phase of cyanide toxicosis included retching, agonal breathing, vocalisation, vomiting, altered levels of ocular reflex, leg paddling, tonic muscular spasms, respiratory distress and muscle fasciculations of the muzzle...|$|E

40|$|Rollover of {{cars and}} light trucks in single vehicle {{accidents}} is of great interest to designers in the automotive industry and to regulators in government agencies. This thesis addresses metrics [...] the static stability factor, the tilt table ratio, the <b>side</b> <b>pull</b> test, and the critical sliding velocity [...] which are proposed measures of vehicle resistance to rollover;A notable finding is that the critical sliding velocity, CSV, is independent of the vehicle mass and roll moment of inertia and depends only on the track width and center of gravity height. Furthermore, while <b>side</b> <b>pull</b> testing and tilt table testing are mainly dependent on the ratio T/ 2 h, CSV is shown to vary widely with h given constant T/ 2 h;A furrow-trip analysis leads to the finding: that the length of the furrow and the characteristics of the vehicle are sufficient to determine the minimum lateral velocity for rollover. The particular force generation mechanism of the furrow/tire interaction {{does not appear to be}} important;In view of the fact that the literature indicates that most fatal rollover accidents are multiple-quarter-turn events, the curb-trip and furrow-trip analyses are extended to determine the minimum lateral velocity to elicit a two-quarter-turn rollover. Notable findings from this analysis are that (a) two-quarter-turn minimum velocities are about twice as high as one-quarter-turn velocities, (b) two-quarter-turn velocities may order vehicles differently than one-quarter-turn velocities, and (c) a key factor in two-quarter-turn velocities may be the roof height of the vehicle. This result should call into question the use of one-quarter-turn measures as the sole indicator of the likelihood of any particular vehicle being involved in a fatal single vehicle rollover accident;Finally, this thesis addresses the sensitivity of various measures of rollover resistance to small parameter changes. The analysis indicates, as expected, that changes in track width and center of gravity height are very important. These are followed by changes in the suspension damping, the overturning moment of the tires, and the roll gain of the suspension...|$|E
40|$|Recent supply {{security}} concerns in Europe have revived interest into {{the natural gas}} market. Here, we investigate investment behavior and trade in an imperfect market structure under uncertainty in both supply and demand. We focus on three uncertain events: i) transit of Russian gas via Ukraine that may be disrupted from 2020 on; ii) natural gas intensity of electricity generation in OECD countries {{that may lead to}} higher or lower natural gas demand after 2025; and iii) availability of shale gas around the globe after 2030. We illustrate how timing of investments is affected by inter-temporal hedging behavior of market agents, such as when LNG capacity provides ex-ante flexibility (e. g., in Ukraine to hedge for a possible Russian supply disruption) or an expost fallback option if domestic or nearby pipeline supply sources are low (e. g., uncertain shale gas resources in China). Moreover, we find that investment in LNG capacities is more determined by demand <b>side</b> <b>pull</b> (due to higher needs in electric power generation) than by supply side push (higher shale gas supplies needing an outlet) ...|$|E
