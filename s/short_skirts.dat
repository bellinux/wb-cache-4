5|$|The Laws of the Game specify {{that all}} players, {{regardless}} of gender, must {{wear the same}} kit, however in September 2008 the Dutch women's team FC de Rakt made international headlines by swapping its old strip {{for a new one}} featuring <b>short</b> <b>skirts</b> and tight-fitting shirts. This innovation, which had been requested by the team itself, was initially vetoed by the KNVB, Dutch football's governing body, but this decision was reversed when it was revealed that the FC de Rakt team were wearing hot pants under their skirts, and were therefore technically in compliance.|$|E
25|$|For example, in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran, many liberal women wore <b>short</b> <b>skirts,</b> flower printed hippie dresses, flared trousers, {{and went}} out in public without the hijab. This changed {{following}} the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, military dictatorship in Pakistan, and Iranian revolution of 1979, when traditional conservative attire including the abaya, jilbab and niqab made a comeback. There were demonstrations in Iran in March 1979, after the hijab law was brought in, decreeing that women in Iran would have to wear scarves to leave the house.|$|E
25|$|Competitive acro dancers {{frequently}} wear costumes when {{performing at}} dance competitions. Acro costumes often have loose fabric pieces such as <b>short</b> <b>skirts,</b> but the sizes and locations of these pieces are carefully calculated {{to ensure that}} they pose no safety risks. As an extra safety measure, skirts are sometimes pinned or stitched at the back below the waistline so that they will not hang at full length when the dancer is inverted, as in hand walking; this prevents the skirt—which might otherwise become entangled in the dancer's hair or costume headpiece—from contacting the dancer's head.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, the {{counterculture}} movement started {{to influence the}} dress of Mormon youth. <b>Short</b> <b>skirts,</b> beards and long hair for men, and dirty clothing became popular. Fearing that {{the counterculture}} fashions would negatively influence morals, leaders began to advise on dress codes more stringently. Men received instruction to avoid long hair and beards because of their association with counterculture; women's dress standards were created to protect their virtue. The miniskirt in particular was denounced as unfashionable as well as immodest. The church's modesty rhetoric in the 1960s and 70s also encouraged women to dress femininely especially as androgynous styles became more popular. A more feminine dress style was associated with acceptance of traditional feminine gender roles of the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Some {{forms of}} sexual violence, such as gang rape, are {{predominantly}} committed by young men. Sexual aggression {{is often a}} defining characteristic of manhood in the group and is {{significantly related to the}} wish to be held in high esteem. Sexually aggressive behavior among young men has been linked with gang membership and having delinquent peers. Research also suggests that men with sexually aggressive peers are also much more likely to report coercive or enforced intercourse outside the gang context than men lacking sexually aggressive peers. Gang rape is often viewed by the men involved, and sometimes by others too, as legitimate, in that it is seen to discourage or punish perceived immoral behavior among women, such as wearing <b>short</b> <b>skirts</b> or frequenting bars.|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} of Tokyo Mew Mew have received praise from several publications for anime, manga, and other media. Anime Fringe Patrick King praised Ikumi's character designs {{for being a}} perfect first for {{the feel of the}} series, noting that [...] "one of the most attractive aspects of Tokyo Mew Mew is easily Mia Ikumi's ultra-cute artwork. Big eyes, cat ears, fuzzy tails, and <b>short</b> <b>skirts</b> all come together in a cuteness combo that's hard to resist." [...] In , Shaenon Garrity referred to the Mew Mews as [...] "cute girls in animal-themed lingerie".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{attracted}} {{some criticism}} from viewers who complained that Amy's character and occupation as a kissogram was [...] "too sexy" [...] {{for a family}} programme. Gillan defended her character, claiming that girls Amy's age often wore <b>short</b> <b>skirts</b> and it showed the character had confidence, while executive producer Piers Wenger said, [...] "The whole kissogram thing played into Steven's desire for the companion to be feisty and outspoken {{and a bit of}} a number.

500|$|Donna's costume {{initially}} involved <b>short</b> <b>skirts,</b> tight-fitting tops, multi-coloured hair extensions and a nose-stud. Jacobs, who affected a Bristolian accent for the role, {{commented that}} Donna had [...] "no {{sense of what}} she should keep covered up." [...] A size 12, Jacobs was not pressured to lose weight for the role, and considered Donna's figure [...] "part of her loveable charm". In early episodes, the character was seen to partake in recreational drug use and arrive for work hungover. Jacobs described her as [...] "everything that you secretly want to be, but can't get away with in normal society", calling her [...] "very gregarious" [...] and immune to maturing. The Guardian Grace Dent deemed her [...] "weak-willed" [...] in a 2006 feature on television medics, and in 2008, the Daily Mirror Jane Simon branded her unintelligent.|$|E
500|$|Gillan had {{substantial}} {{input into}} Amy's costume, {{as well as}} her hair and make-up. In the first episode, Holman stated that Amy's identity was not clear and she wore her own clothes later on. Gillan thought that Amy had inner confidence to wear clothes that showed [...] "a bit of skin from time to time". She tried on many things, {{but when it came to}} <b>short</b> <b>skirts</b> she [...] "just thought it was right" [...] and showed that Amy was [...] "comfortable and confident about her look". She believed that the skirts reflected what young women typically wear at her age. Executive producer Piers Wenger also noted that Amy's 1970s flying jacket, which she wears [...] "quite a lot", reflected Gillan was a [...] "born adventurer" [...] and Amy developed a love for travel and adventure.|$|E

500|$|In 1986, the {{character}} of Nancy Drew was used in a new series, The Nancy Drew Files, which lasted until 1997. The Nancy of the Files series is also interested in romance and boys, a fact which led to much criticism of the series: [...] "Millie [...] purists tend to look askance upon the Files series, in which fleeting pecks bestowed on Nancy by her longtime steady, Ned Nickerson, give way to lingering embraces in a Jacuzzi." [...] Cover art for Files titles, such as Hit and Run Holiday (1986), reflects these changes; Nancy is often dressed provocatively, in <b>short</b> <b>skirts,</b> shirts that reveal her stomach or breasts, or a bathing suit. She is often pictured with an attentive, handsome male in the background, and frequently appears aware of and interested in that male. Nancy also becomes more vulnerable, being often chloroformed into unconsciousness, or defenseless against chokeholds. The books place more emphasis on violence and character relationships.|$|E

Wenger defended the character, saying that, [...] "The whole kissogram thing played into Steven's desire for the companion to be feisty and outspoken and a bit of a number. Amy is probably the wildest companion that the Doctor has travelled with, but she isn't promiscuous." [...] Gillan also defended her character, claiming that girls Amy's age often wore <b>short</b> <b>skirts</b> and Amy was a [...] "strong female" [...] and a [...] "normal girl with normal impulses".

500|$|Hindley {{began to}} change her {{appearance}} further, wearing clothing considered risqué such as high boots, <b>short</b> <b>skirts</b> and leather jackets, and the two became less sociable to their colleagues. The couple were regulars at the library, borrowing books on philosophy, as well as crime and torture. They also read works by the Marquis de Sade, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment. Although Hindley was not a qualified driver (she passed her test on the third attempt, late in 1963), she often hired a van, {{in which the two}} planned bank robberies. Hindley befriended George Clitheroe, the President of the Cheadle Rifle Club, and on several occasions visited two local shooting ranges. Clitheroe, although puzzled by her interest, arranged for her to buy a [...]22 rifle from a gun merchant in Manchester. She also asked to join a pistol club, but she was a poor shot and allegedly often bad-tempered, so Clitheroe told her that she was unsuitable; she did though manage to purchase a Webley [...]45 and a Smith & Wesson [...]38 from other members of the club. Brady and Hindley's plans for robbery came to nothing, but they became interested in photography. Brady already owned a Box Brownie, which he used to take photographs of Hindley and her dog, Puppet, but he upgraded to a more sophisticated model, and also purchased lights and darkroom equipment. The pair took photographs of each other that, for the time, would have been considered explicit. For Hindley, this demonstrated a marked change from her earlier, more shy and prudish nature.|$|E
500|$|James Douglas {{illustrated}} his {{denunciation of}} The Well with {{a photograph of}} Radclyffe Hall in a silk smoking jacket and bow tie, holding a cigarette and monocle. She was also wearing a straight knee-length skirt, but later Sunday Express articles cropped the photo so tightly that it became difficult to tell she was not wearing trousers. Hall's style of dress was not scandalous in the 1920s; short hairstyles were common, and the combination of tailored jackets and <b>short</b> <b>skirts</b> was a recognised fashion, discussed in magazines as the [...] "severely masculine" [...] look. Some lesbians, like Hall, adopted variations of the style {{as a way of}} signalling their sexuality, but it was a code that only a few knew how to read. With the controversy over The Well of Loneliness, Hall became the public face of sexual inversion, and all women who favoured masculine fashions came under new scrutiny. Lesbian journalist Evelyn Irons– who considered Hall's style of dress [...] "rather effeminate" [...] compared to her own– said that after the publication of The Well, truck drivers would call out on the street to any woman who wore a collar and tie: [...] "Oh, you're Miss Radclyffe Hall". Some welcomed their newfound visibility: when Hall spoke at a luncheon in 1932, the audience was full of women who had imitated her look. But in a study of lesbian women in Salt Lake City in the 1920s and '30s, nearly all regretted the publication of The Well because it had drawn unwanted attention to them.|$|E
500|$|Tokyo Mew Mew was {{generally}} well received by reviewers, who {{described it as}} cute and entertaining. Though AnimeFringe Patrick King notes {{that it is not}} a very intellectual series and that it avoids complex plot points, he lauded it as engrossing [...] "brain candy" [...] and an [...] "endearing action-romance" [...] that has no [...] "delusions of grandeur". Critics praised the artwork in both Tokyo Mew Mew and the sequel Tokyo Mew Mew à La Mode. Ikumi's [...] "free flowing" [...] style and character designs were seen as a perfect fit for the series. Criticism of Ikumi's art focused on images which regularly spilled out of panel borders and speech bubbles with ambiguous speakers. Patrick King of Animefringe stated: [...] "one of the most attractive aspects of Tokyo Mew Mew is easily Mia Ikumi's ultra-cute artwork. Big eyes, cat ears, fuzzy tails, and <b>short</b> <b>skirts</b> all come together in a cuteness combo that's hard to resist." [...] According to Carlo Santos of Anime News Network, [...] "Mia Ikumi's artwork is perfectly suited to the story, and it is not even all that wispy and frilly compared to other shōjo material. Like many budding manga artist, Ikumi's greatest strength is in carefully posed character portraits, and her prolific use of tones creates unique effects while also sidestepping the challenge of backgrounds." [...] Conversely, in writing for , Shaenon Garrity criticizes the series, calling it [...] "uninspired", [...] "insipid" [...] and [...] "creative bankrupt" [...] and feeling it was [...] "clearly designed by its publisher to ride the magical girl tsunami for all it was worth: the creators' marginal notes are filled with references to big book signings, photo shoots, and models hired to dress as the scantily clad preteen heroines." [...] She also remarks that the series makes poor use of its endangered species theme, while still having a [...] "preachy environmental theme".|$|E

500|$|Swift became {{inspired}} to write [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] after she overheard a male {{friend of hers}} speaking to his girlfriend through a phone call. He acted defensive as his girlfriend yelled at him, and said to her, [...] "No, baby...I had {{to get off the}} phone really quickly... I tried to call you right back... Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I’m so sorry." [...] Out of the sympathy she felt towards him in the situation, Swift developed a concept for a song. In a writing session with co-writer Liz Rose, Swift explained the situation along with her idea and conceived the song's opening line, [...] "You’re on the phone with your girlfriend / she’s upset / she's going off about something that you said." [...] Together, they developed a story line, which described Swift being in love with the male friend and her having the desire for him to break up with his current girlfriend for her. Swift described the song's concept as [...] "basically about wanting someone who is with this girl who doesn't appreciate him at all. Basically like 'girl-next-door-itis.' You like this guy who you have known for your whole life, and you know him better than she does but somehow the popular girl gets the guy every time." [...] Swift recalled, [...] "It was really fun for us to write the line, 'She wears <b>short</b> <b>skirts,</b> I wear T-shirts'." [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on November 4, 2008, as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; the song was then released as the third single from Fearless on April 18, 2009.|$|E
