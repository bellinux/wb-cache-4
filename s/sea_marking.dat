The tall, gray mountains that back it, their sides bristling with pines--cloven with ravines--here and there a hoary rock towering into view--long, straight streaks sweeping down from the summit to the <b>sea,</b> <b>marking</b> the passage of some avalanche of former times--all these were as like what one sees in the Sierras as if the one were a portrait of the other. The little village of Yalta nestles at the foot of an amphitheatre which slopes backward and upward to the wall of hills, and looks as if it might have sunk quietly down to its present position from a higher elevation. This depression is covered with the great parks and gardens of noblemen, and through the mass of green foliage the bright colors of their palaces bud out here and there like flowers. It is a beautiful spot.|$|E

50|$|The {{status of}} Doberan was {{considerably}} enhanced the 18th century when the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Frederick Francis I chose {{it for the}} recreation and entertainment of the ducal family, the Mecklenburg nobility and, later, some of the wealthy bourgeoisie too.

As a result, in 1793, the duke bathed {{on the advice of}} his Rostock physician, Samuel Gottlieb Vogel, at the Heiliger Damm in the Baltic <b>Sea,</b> <b>marking</b> the birth of the first German seaside resort, Heiligendamm. The bathers stayed in Doberan and played on slot machines (the ducal resort coffers collected 30,000 thalers of royalties from Doberan's casinos), dancing, and horse racing (probably the first horse race in Germany took place here on 10 August 1822).|$|E

5000|$|Modern Israeli {{scholars}} have identified {{most of the}} towns mentioned in the Book of Joshua and that belong to the lot of Benjamin. Only those towns and villages on the northern-most and southern-most territorial boundary lines, or purlieu, are named in the land allocation, although, in actuality, all unnamed towns and villages in between these boundaries would still belong to the tribe of Benjamin. The Babylonian Talmud names three of these cities, {{all of which were}} formerly enclosed by a wall, and belonged to the tribe of Benjamin: Lydda (Lod), Ono (Kfar 'Ana = كفر ئنا - wherein is now built Or Yehudah), and Gei Ha-ḥarashim. Presumably, the westward boundary of the tribe of Benjamin would have stretched as far as the Mediterranean <b>Sea.</b> <b>Marking</b> what {{is now one of the}} southern-most butts and bounds of Benjamin's territory is [...] "the spring of the waters of Nephtoah" [...] (Josh. 18:15), a place identified as Kefar Lifta (كفر لفتا), and situated on the left-hand side of the road as one enters Jerusalem. It is now an abandoned Arab village. The word Lifta is merely a corruption of the Hebrew name Nephtoah, and where a natural spring by that name still abounds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} {{high-resolution}} palaeoenvironmental reconstruction covering the late Holocene from the Skagerrak and other {{sites in the}} North Sea area. The data, {{which are based on}} the analyses of marine sediment cores, reveal a marked environmental shift that took place between AD 700 and AD 1100, with the most pronounced changes occurring at AD 900. Both surface and bottom waters in the Skagerrak were subject to major circulation and productivity changes at this time due to an enhanced advection of Atlantic waters to the North <b>Sea</b> <b>marking</b> the beginning of the ‘Mediaeval Warm Period ’ (MWP). The observed increase in bottom current strength is especially remarkable as there is hardly any comparable signal in the older part of the record going back to 1000 BC. At the transition to the ‘Little Ice Age ’ (LIA) the bottom current strength remains at a high level, now probably forced by atmospheric circulation. Thus, despite opposite temperature forcing, these two consecutive climate scenarios are apparently able to generate distinctly stronger bottom currents in the Skagerrak than observed in the preceding 2000 years, and demonstrate the significance of climatic forcing in shaping the marine environment. Indeed, both the MWP and the LIA are reported as strong climatic signals in northwest Europe, being the warmest (excep...|$|E

40|$|Two {{types of}} second {{baroclinic}} mode (mode- 2) internal solitary waves (ISWs) {{were found on}} the continental slope of the northern South China Sea. The convex waveform displaced the thermal structure upward in the upper layer and downward in the lower layer, causing a bulge in the thermocline. The concave waveform did the opposite, causing a constriction. A few concave waves were observed in the South China <b>Sea,</b> <b>marking</b> the first documentation of such waves. On the basis of the Korteweg-de Vries (K-dV) equation, an analytical three-layer ocean model was used to study the characteristics of the two mode- 2 ISW types. The analytical solution was primarily a function of the thickness of each layer and the density difference between the layers. Middle-layer thickness {{plays a key role in}} the resulting mode- 2 ISW. A convex wave was generated when the middle-layer thickness was relatively thinner than the upper and lower layers, whereas only a concave wave could be produced when the middle-layer thickness was greater than half the water depth. In accordance with the K-dV equation, a positive and negative quadratic nonlinearity coefficient, &alpha; 2 , which is primarily dominated by the middle-layer thickness, resulted in convex and concave waves, respectively. The analytical solution showed that the wave propagation of a convex (concave) wave has the same direction as the current velocity in the middle (upper or lower) layer. Analysis of the three-layer ocean model properly reproduced the characteristics of the observed mode- 2 ISWs in the South China Sea and provided a criterion for the existence of convex or concave waves. Concave waves were seldom seen because of the rarity of a stratified ocean with a thick middle layer. This analytical result agreed well with the observations...|$|E
