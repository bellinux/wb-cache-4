50|$|A {{drainage}} {{pattern is}} described as discordant {{if it does not}} correlate to the topography and geology of the area. Discordant drainage patterns are classified into two main types: antecedent and superimposed, while anteposition drainage patterns combine the two. In antecedent drainage, a river's vertical incision ability matches that of land uplift due to tectonic forces. <b>Superimposed</b> <b>drainage</b> develops differently: initially, a drainage system develops on a surface composed of 'younger' rocks, but due to denudative activities this surface of younger rocks is removed and the river continues to flow over a seemingly new surface, but one in fact made up of rocks of old geological formation.|$|E
40|$|Facies {{patterns}} of Neogene strata lying along the intensely faulted southern Sierra Nevada range front indicate that Neogene marine conditions extended for a non-trivial distance across the currently exposed southern Sierra basement. Emergence {{of the basement}} is controlled by active W-side-up normal faulting along the Kern Canyon-Breckenridge system, and active NE-side-up normal faulting along the Kern range front-Pond-Poso system. Together these systems produce the regional wedge shaped Breckenridge-Greenhorn horst. The lower slopes of the horst constitute the Kern Arch, a pervasively faulted homocline across which {{the remnants of the}} SE SJB Neogene section are undergoing erosion. Neogene basin slope, shelfal, shoreline and paralic facies strata occur continuously along the range front, both faulted against basement and as nonconformable tongues preserved along relay ramps in the fault system. Geologic relations in conjunction with He apatite thermochronometry suggest Neogene growth faulting and transfer motion along the Breckenridge fault, which bounded a system of NW-striking normal faults to the east. Together these faults produced the volcanic (Walker) graben in which the western flank of the 21 - 16 Ma Cache Peak volcanic center ponded. The southwest corner of the Walker graben was breached by normal faults of the Edison graben that formed a structural trough into the SJB. Currently it is unclear if marine conditions extended all the way into the Walker graben, either through an Edison graben channel, or by overtopping the growing Breckenridge fault. Regional U/Pb zircon basement geochronology and detrital zircon ages from upper Neogene strata, in conjunction with other provenance and stratigraphic data indicate that the Bena Gravel and “Kern River” Formation represent a prograding delta-fluvial plain system that flooded into the SJB, primarily through the Edison graben, as the southern Sierra began regional ascent in the Late Miocene. Continued regional uplift has resulted in the redistribution of most of the Walker graben fill into the SE SJB. In late Pliocene-Quaternary time the Breckenridge-Greenhorn horst began forming with the progressive exhumation of overlying SJB margin strata, and the incision of the lower Kern gorge as a <b>superimposed</b> <b>drainage...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{agricultural}} areas, tillage-induced roughness {{may have}} large impacts on runoff patterns and therefore on the effective slope, local contributing areas and erosion patterns. A model {{was developed to}} create a runoff pattern with flow {{in the direction of}} the plough-lines for all tilled fields within a catchment. The model needs a digital elevation model (DEM), a landuse map and the major tillage orientation per tilled field as input. Optionally. the flow direction of roads and/or channels can be <b>superimposed</b> on the <b>drainage</b> network. The model calculates flow directions along parcel borders and creates headlands along borders that are not parallel to the tillage orientation. The model also calculates the slope gradient in flow direction. The created tillage-controlled runoff pattern can be combined with the topographic runoff pattern. if decision rules are available to choose between topographic or tillage direction. The tillage runoff pattern can be very different from the topographic pattern, leading to totally different patterns of slope and contributing area. The use of the tillage-controlled runoff pattern rather than the topographically controlled runoff pattern in a deterministic, event-based model (LISEM). results in a much better agreement of the predicted runoff and erosion pattern with field observations. However, accurate model predictions can only be obtained if the input DEM is sufficiently accurate to represent local topographic variations in the fields. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.
