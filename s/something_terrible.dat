The idea of a scientist {{trying to stop the}} invention of <b>something</b> <b>terrible</b> was inspired by Manhattan Project physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who complained to Harry S. Truman about the 1945 atomic bombings of Japan.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after returning, Heather {{slips into}} a trance so John makes his excuses and quickly leaves. Upon {{coming out of}} it she pleads with her sister to go after John, sensing that <b>something</b> <b>terrible</b> is about to happen, but Wendy is unable to catch up with him. Meanwhile, John catches another glimpse of the mysterious figure in red and this time pursues it. He corners the elusive figure in a deserted palazzo and {{approaches}} it, believing it to be a child. Instead, it is revealed to be a hideous female dwarf, and while John is frozen in terror the dwarf pulls out a meat cleaver and cuts his throat. As the life drains from him, John realises too late that the strange sightings he has been experiencing were premonitions of his own murder and funeral.|$|E
500|$|Monk was {{originally}} envisioned as a [...] "more goofy and physical" [...] Inspector Clouseau type of character. However, co-creator David Hoberman {{came up with}} the idea of a detective with obsessive-compulsive disorder. This was inspired by his own bout with self-diagnosed obsessive-compulsive disorder; in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette interview, he stated that, [...] "Like Monk, I couldn't walk on cracks and had to touch poles. I have no idea why [...] but if I didn't do these things, <b>something</b> <b>terrible</b> would happen." ...|$|E

500|$|In the anime, an {{organization}} {{known only as}} [...] "The Syndicate" [...] is aware of Chi and her special programming. Under the impression that <b>something</b> <b>terrible</b> will happen if her program executes successfully, they send two persocoms, Zima and Dita, to destroy her. Towards {{the end of the}} series Chi tells Hideki of her love, asking if it is requited. Hideki responds with a yes, and they embrace briefly before Chi's program executes. Chi floats up to the roof of the apartment and begins to run her program. Hideki makes his way on to the roof to save her. Chi is able to complete her program but chooses not to. She retreats inside herself, and Freya takes control as Chitose Hibiya arrives on the rooftop.|$|E
500|$|President Clinton {{stated that}} after seeing images of babies being {{pulled from the}} wreckage, he was [...] "beyond angry" [...] and wanted to [...] "put [...] fist through the television". Clinton and his wife Hillary {{requested}} that aides talk to child care specialists about how {{to communicate with the}} children regarding the bombing. President Clinton spoke to the nation three days after the bombing, saying: [...] "I don't want our children to believe <b>something</b> <b>terrible</b> about life and the future and grownups in general because of this awful thing... most adults are good people who want to protect our children in their childhood {{and we are going to}} get through this". On April 22, 1995, the Clintons spoke in the White House with over 40federal agency employees and their children, and in a live nationwide television and radio broadcast, addressed their concerns.|$|E
500|$|Wagner's uneasy {{affair with}} Mathilde {{collapsed}} in 1858, when Minna intercepted {{a letter to}} Mathilde from him. After the resulting confrontation with Minna, Wagner left Zürich alone, bound for Venice, where he rented {{an apartment in the}} Palazzo Giustinian, while Minna returned to Germany. Wagner's attitude to Minna had changed; the editor of his correspondence with her, John Burk, has said that she was to him [...] "an invalid, to be treated with kindness and consideration, but, except at a distance, [...] a menace to his peace of mind." [...] Wagner continued his correspondence with Mathilde and his friendship with her husband Otto, who maintained his financial support of the composer. In an 1859 letter to Mathilde, Wagner wrote, half-satirically, of Tristan: [...] "Child! This Tristan is turning into <b>something</b> <b>terrible.</b> This final act!!!—I fear the opera will be banned... only mediocre performances can save me! Perfectly good ones will be bound to drive people mad." ...|$|E

500|$|Noting the realism in {{the writing}} for the series, Gilchrist stated: [...] "It's as if Rhimes and Co. {{harnessed}} the sublime and the mundane of our daily experiences, that strange sense of drama that emerges from even the most unimportant daily conflicts, and it transported it on {{a world that is}} legitimately fraught with life and death decisions." [...] However, he expressed disappointment in {{the end of the second}} season, which he deemed surprisingly less strong, compared to the [...] "powerful" [...] first half and the [...] "immaculate" [...] first season, describing Stevens' [...] "awkward and self-destructive" [...] relationship with a patient as a way to [...] "slow episodes to a screeching halt with maudlin and painfully underdeveloped turns towards melodrama", while expressing the predictability of Duquette's death. Gilchrist stated in response to Stevens' development in the last part of the second season: [...] "Izzie's descent into abject hysteria, which followed her season-long sanctimoniousness about everything, actually made me want <b>something</b> <b>terrible</b> to happen to her too." [...] He described how some episodes were not among the show's strongest, noting that the some plot lines created poignancy, and connected in an unfamiliar way.|$|E
500|$|Actor Mickey Rourke asked Bowie to be {{involved}} in one of the songs, the two having met in London where Rourke was based while filming the movie A Prayer for the Dying. Bowie had him perform the mid-song rap to the song [...] "Shining Star (Makin' My Love)." [...] Bowie jokingly referred to Rourke's performance as [...] "method rapping". Bowie described the song as one that [...] "reflects back-to-street situations, and how people are trying to get together in the face of so many disasters and catastrophes, socially around them, never knowing if they're going to survive it themselves. The one thing they have got to cling on to is each other; although it might resolve into <b>something</b> <b>terrible,</b> it's the only thing that they've got. It’s just a little love song coming out of that environment." [...] He rejected the notion that his [...] "high, little" [...] voice (which he attributed to Smokey Robinson) in the song was a new character (to follow behind Ziggy Stardust or the Thin White Duke), instead saying it was just what the song needed, as he had tried the song in his regular voice and did not like the outcome: [...] "That never bothered me, changing voices to suit a song. You can fool about with it." [...] "Shining Star" [...] was one of Bowie's early choices to be a single for the album, but EMI had the final say and did not release the song as a single. A 12" [...] remix of the song was made available on iTunes when the [...] " [...] was released digitally {{for the first time in}} 2007.|$|E
500|$|Perry and Doofenshmirtz {{at first}} seem to loathe {{each other in}} the {{beginning}} of the series, and have been arch-nemeses since the day they met. However, they are often cordial and friendly towards one another and it is said by Doofenshmirtz that Perry is his best friend, and Perry will often act to save Doofenshmirtz's life when his plot inevitably blows up in his face. Doofenshmirtz also went out of his way in one episode to become closer to Perry after he is assigned to a new villain. [...] Habitually, their daily brawls involve Doofenshmirtz devising a scheme, which Perry goes to stop after being briefed by Major Monogram. He is trapped by Doofenshmirtz while trying to do so and is told of the doctor's scheme, usually pertaining to some backstory or pet peeve. He then escapes and the two fight, Perry coming out victorious with Doofenshmirtz yelling [...] "Curse you, Perry the Platypus!". The two rely on this daily structure, Doofenshmirtz even specifically mentioning it in [...] "Journey to the Center of Candace" [...] and in episodes such as [...] "It's About Time!" [...] in which Doofenshmirtz temporarily replaces Perry with secret agent Peter The Panda and they become depressed about not having each other to fight. Perry realizes he misses Doof too. When Perry does not arrive on the scene of Doofenshmirtz's evil plan, the doctor hesitates to execute his plans and fears for where Perry has gone, though he notes that he [...] "hopes <b>something</b> <b>terrible</b> has happened to him.". Sometimes, they decided not to fight and have fun, as shown in [...] "Happy New Year!" [...] and [...] "Candace Disconnected". On other occasions, depending on whatever situation Doofenshmirtz is facing, Perry would often help Doofenshmirtz with his non-evil plans, such as helping him overcome evil scientist's block, helping him put on a birthday party for his 16-year-old daughter Vanessa, impressing a square dancing girl with programmable square dancing boots that Doofenshmritz created, working together to stop a raging platypus hunter from hunting them down, or helping him convince his rich ex-wife to help pay off his mortgage debt. Also, Perry tends to use Doofenshmirtz's inventions to erase evidence of whatever contraptions Phineas and Ferb had made, leaving Candace unable to bust them. Examples include when Perry asked to borrow Doofenshmirtz's robot Norm to pick up footage from the city surveillance cameras in order to preserve his job as an agent, as well as using Doofenshmirtz's Pick-Him-Up-inator to rescue a lost Candace and bring her home.|$|E

[...] In a 2005 interview by Kopfhalter! magazine, Gray explains {{why so many of}} her works happen in coastal Maine: [...] "I like to think it's more cerebral than merely writing what I know, but when it comes right down to the wire, New England is a fairly scary place. Without question, coastal Downeast Maine is beautiful, breathtaking even, but bottom line is this: it's an isolated, harsh and natural beauty, and nature itself is neutral, neither bad nor good. It just is. Only when <b>something</b> <b>terrible</b> happens...it seems mighty evil. That's what's really frightening: the misinterpretation of events and the inability to foresee what lies ahead..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most of Broadchurch series one {{was shot}} on location, which the {{producers}} felt would heighten the reality and intimacy of the series. Location shooting was also {{important because the}} Dorset coast was integral to setting {{the mood of the}} drama. Director James Strong said the goal was to make Broadchurch [...] "look and feel different", [...] "a world that was recognisable but in subtle extremis—an ordinary seaside town where events have upset the natural order of life. It is a lovely, beautiful place where <b>something</b> <b>terrible</b> has happened." [...] Strong chose a visual style that emphasised contradictory elements, such as privacy and publicity, the natural and unnatural, or water and fire. Another part of the visual style was to connect the characters to the Dorset landscape. To achieve this, locations were chosen which would allow the characters to bring their private behaviors outside. A third element of the visual style was to use the change in seasons to help illuminate the way the emotional tenor of the drama changes during the series.|$|E
