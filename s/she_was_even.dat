5|$|Danton was a semi-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy and {{the lead}} ship of her class. She was a technological leap in battleship development for the French Navy, as {{she was the first}} ship in the fleet with turbine engines. However, like all battleships of her type, she was completed after the Royal Navy battleship , and as such she was outclassed before <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> commissioned.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{attempts}} to return Frunze to service were to restore her to original design, but money ran out before <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> half completed. Subsequent plans {{that focused on}} reconstructing her as a modernized equivalent to her sisters or even as a battlecruiser, with one turret deleted to save weight, were considered, but finally abandoned on 23 January 1935 when all work was stopped.|$|E
5|$|She, {{along with}} the {{remaining}} members of the Imperial Family, was sent into exile after a coup d'état staged by a clique of army officers in 1889. Being cast from her beloved adopted land had a devastating effect on Teresa Cristina's spirit and health. Grieving and ill, she died of respiratory failure leading to cardiac arrest {{little more than a}} month after the monarchy's collapse. She was greatly loved by her subjects, both during her lifetime and afterwards. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> respected by the Republicans who overthrew the Empire. Despite having had no direct impact on Brazil's political history, Teresa Cristina is well regarded by historians not only for her character and irreproachable behavior, but also for her sponsorship of Brazilian culture.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} she was cast, Varsi already had an agent and had been searching for film roles for a long while, without any luck. She made rounds at several studios, but {{according}} to the actress, they all thought she was suitable for character parts only. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> dropped by her agent in 1956, because he saw no future in her career.|$|E
25|$|Nancy was {{launched}} in 1792 and traded with Quebec. In 1793 she made one voyage for the British East India Company (EIC). On her return as she traded with Sierra Leone a French privateer captured her, though the British Royal Navy recaptured her only days later. She then traded with Antigua, where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> less fortunate. A French squadron captured her in 1805 and burnt her.|$|E

25|$|Consort Yang {{became so}} favored that {{whenever}} she rode a horse, the eunuch Gao Lishi would attend her. 700 laborers were conscripted to sew fabrics for her. Officials and generals flattered her by offering her exquisite tributes. In 746, she angered Emperor Xuanzong by being jealous and rude to him, {{and he had}} her sent to her cousin Yang Xian's mansion. Later that day, however, his mood was such {{that he could not}} eat, and he battered his servants for minor offenses. Gao knew that he missed Consort Yang, and requested that the treasures in Consort Yang's palace be sent to her. Emperor Xuanzong agreed, and sent imperial meals to her as well. That night, Gao requested that Emperor Xuanzong welcome Consort Yang back to the palace, a request that Emperor Xuanzong easily agreed to. Thereafter, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> more favored, and no other imperial consort drew his favor.|$|E

We disagree with the basic premise, Zarf/Zoe as a MTF transgendered lesbian. We want Bianca to be with a woman (and she did have a one-night stand with Leslie on New Year’s Eve, which has to be a first for a daytime soap). We don’t want her already messy love life in which she has never been allowed to have a fully realized relationship with another woman (her first lover went crazy and was institutionalized, her next was killed, the next was a corporate thief who then had to return to Poland, the next identical twin of the one who was killed wasn’t sure <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> queer and then left her for another woman).

25|$|In 1967, Dunham {{opened the}} Performing Arts Training Center (PATC) in East St. Louis {{as an attempt}} to use the arts to combat poverty and urban unrest. It served as a {{catharsis}} after the 1968 riots, during which she encouraged gang members in the ghetto to vent their frustrations with drumming and dance. The PATC drew on former members of Dunham's touring company as well as local residents for its teaching staff. While trying to help the young people in the community <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> jailed herself, making international headlines which quickly embarrassed local police officials to release her. She also continued refining and teaching the Dunham Technique to transmit that knowledge to succeeding generations of dance students, and lecturing at annual Masters' Seminars in St. Louis that attracted dance students from around the world every summer until her death. She also established the Katherine Dunham Centers for Arts and Humanities in East St. Louis to preserve Haitian and African instruments and artifacts from her own personal collection.|$|E

500|$|Harisu made {{a return}} to Korean screens in early 2005, after being cast in the MBC miniseries Beating Heart, her first major role in a Korean drama. She starred in several episodes as a {{transsexual}} woman, returning to her family after a lengthy absence {{in a bid to}} gain acceptance. Later that year her Foxy Lady album was released in Taiwan and China with the inclusion of songs re-recorded in Mandarin, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> promoted by her Taiwanese record label as the [...] "Kylie Minogue of the East". In September 2005, Harisu gained a foothold in Malaysia after signing a three-year memorandum of understanding with Hock Star Entertainment, a deal which included the production of two feature films and secured the Malaysian release of her album.|$|E
500|$|The queen {{became a}} subject of several {{contemporary}} panegyrics, such as Chakhrukhadze's Tamariani and Ioane Shavteli's Abdul-Mesia. She was eulogized in the chronicles, most notably in the two accounts centered on her reign – The Life of Tamar, Queen of Queens and The Histories and Eulogies of the Sovereigns – which became the primary sources of Tamar's sanctification in Georgian literature. The chroniclers exalt her as a [...] "protector of the widowed" [...] and [...] "the thrice blessed", and place a particular emphasis on Tamar's virtues as a woman: beauty, humility, love of mercy, fidelity, and purity. Although Tamar was canonized by the Georgian church much later, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> named as a saint in her lifetime in a bilingual Greco-Georgian colophon attached to the manuscript of the Vani Gospels.|$|E
500|$|SMS Hannover ("His Majesty's Ship Hannover") was {{the second}} of five [...] pre-dreadnoughts of the German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine). Hannover and the three {{subsequently}} constructed ships differed slightly in both design and construction from the lead ship [...] in their propulsion systems and slightly thicker armor. Hannover was laid down in November 1904 and commissioned into the High Seas Fleet in October 1907; this was ten months after the revolutionary [...] "all-big-gun" [...] was commissioned into the Royal Navy. As a result, Hannover was obsolete as a capital ship before <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> completed; Dreadnoughts more powerful main battery and higher speed {{would have made it}} unwise for a ship like Hannover to engage her in the line of battle. The ship was named after the Prussian province of Hannover, now in Lower Saxony.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{introduces}} the character Michonne, a protagonist in the comic {{series of the}} same name who is portrayed by Danai Gurira. Gurira was cast as part of the series a week before the broadcasting of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] although rumors of introducing Michonne circulated months prior to the season finale. Kirkman admitted that he was a fan of her work in the HBO drama series Treme. Rutina Wesley, who played Tara Thornton in True Blood, was rumored to be considered for the role of Michonne, although Kirkman stated that she was never involved in the auditioning process. [...] "It was a lot of actresses. The True Blood actress, I don't know that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> available; I think she's still on True Blood. I don't know where that rumor came from, but to my knowledge, she was never involved." ...|$|E
500|$|In the DVD {{commentary}} for the episode, Gilligan {{revealed that}} he wrote {{the character of the}} genie, Jenn, with Janeane Garofalo in mind, but she was unavailable at the time of filming. However, he was ultimately very pleased with Paula Sorge's performance, stating [...] "In fact, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> better than how I had written the character. In Paula's audition, she came off like a world-weary wise-ass who was not only tough and smart, but had a heart of gold. She made it a really fun character." [...] The casting process to find an actress for the part took so long that an idea Gilligan had to give the character double pupils had to be scrapped when the production team ran out of time to source them. Instead, she wore contacts over her already blue eyes to make them brighter, and a blue jewel on her cheekbone.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, {{the laws}} against pimping and {{communicating}} provisions {{were determined to}} be constitutional and were retained. As of 2013, {{the constitutionality of the}} law against brothels was still under review. Falle said that brothels should not be legalized, saying, [...] "I know firsthand and... from the disclosures of the many women that I've been able to counsel over the years that most violence happens behind closed doors." [...] Falle said that if brothels were legalized, the police would have less legal ability to find women and children victimized by human trafficking. Bedford said that legalizing brothels would make prostitution safer for women because it would allow prostitution to take place indoors. Falle responded that most prostitution has already moved indoors, as the internet has made most street solicitation unnecessary, and argues that the move indoors has not made the women safer. She said that when she was in prostitution, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> a little safer outdoors because of the added visibility to the public. In discussion of the case, Falle said, [...] "I don't know anyone in the prostitution business who hasn’t ended up dead, in jail, or on drugs." [...] She intended to bring a pimp stick to the Supreme Court of Canada in June 2013 as a visual aid in explaining how pimps often abuse the women they prostitute.|$|E

500|$|Henry I of England {{named his}} {{daughter}} Matilda heir; {{but when he}} died in 1135 Matilda was far from England in Anjou or Maine, while her cousin Stephen was closer in Boulogne, giving him the advantage he needed to race to England and have himself crowned and anointed king of England. [...] Matilda's husband Geoffrey, though he had little interest in England, commenced a long struggle for the duchy of Normandy. To create a second front Matilda landed in England during 1139 to challenge Stephen, instigating the civil war known as the Anarchy. In 1141 she captured Stephen at the battle of Lincoln, prompting the collapse of his support. [...] While Geoffrey pushed on with the conquest of Normandy over the next four years, Matilda threw away her position through arrogance and inability to be magnanimous in victory. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> forced to release Stephen in a hostage exchange for her half-brother Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester, allowing Stephen to resume control of much of England. Geoffrey never visited England to offer practical assistance but instead sent Henry as a male figureheadbeginning in 1142 when Henry was only 9with a view that if England was conquered it would be Henry that would become king. In 1150 Geoffrey also transferred the title of Duke of Normandy to Henry but retained the dominant role in governance.

500|$|Despite their oppositional nature, cult films {{can produce}} celebrities. [...] Like cult films themselves, {{authenticity}} {{is an important}} aspect of their popularity. [...] Actors can become typecast as they become strongly associated with such iconic roles. Tim Curry, despite his acknowledged range as an actor, found casting difficult after he achieved fame in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. [...] Even when discussing unrelated projects, interviewers frequently bring up the role, which causes him to tire of discussing it. Mary Woronov, known for her transgressive roles in cult films, eventually transitioned to mainstream films. She was expected to recreate the transgressive elements of her cult films within the confines of mainstream cinema. [...] Instead of the complex gender deconstructions of her Andy Warhol films, she became typecast as a lesbian or domineering woman. Sylvia Kristel, after starring in Emmanuelle (1974), found herself highly associated with the film and the sexual liberation of the 1970s. [...] Caught between the transgressive elements of her cult film and the mainstream appeal of soft-core pornography, she was unable to work in anything but exploitation films and Emmanuelle sequels. [...] Despite her immense popularity and cult following, she would rate only a footnote in most histories of European cinema if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> mentioned. [...] Similarly, Chloë Sevigny has struggled with her reputation as a cult independent film star famous for her daring roles in transgressive films. [...] Cult films can also trap directors. Leonard Kastle, who directed The Honeymoon Killers (1969), never directed another film again. [...] Despite his cult following, which included François Truffaut, he was unable to find financing for any of his other screenplays. [...] Qualities that bring cult films to prominence – such as an uncompromising, unorthodox vision – caused Alejandro Jodorowsky to languish in obscurity for years.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to writing her own lyrics, Hamasaki has also involved herself in {{other aspects of}} production such as artistic direction. Though Max Matsuura is officially credited as the producer of her records, he said of Hamasaki, [...] "Ayu is a very meticulous worker behind the scenes. A lot of the work she does by herself is more in the producer's arena. I think really we should say 'Produced by yumi amasaki'." [...] Until her single [...] "M", however, Hamasaki left the task of composing to her staff; as she has explained, [...] "I'm not a professional; I lack even basic knowledge about writing music." [...] However, she started to compose her own melodies after her staff had failed to compose a tune for [...] "M" [...] that appealed to her. Wanting to produce works faithful to her visions, Hamasaki took control of most aspects of her artistry. I Am... is representative of this stage in Hamasaki's career; she directed the production of its songs, videos, and artwork. She began to compose less after I Am...: whereas nearly all of I Am... was her work, only nine of Rainbows fifteen tracks were composed by her. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> less involved {{in the composition of}} subsequent albums, composing two tracks on Memorial Address, three on My Story, and one on (Miss)understood; since Secret, none of the songs on her studio albums have listed her as a composer. With later albums, Hamasaki also began to delegate to her staff tasks she had once handled herself. Hamasaki cites Madonna, soul musicians Babyface and En Vogue, and rock bands Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple as her influences and states that she admires Michelle Branch, Kid Rock, Joan Osborne, Seiko Matsuda, Rie Miyazawa, and Keiko Yamada; these diverse influences have led to the variety of her own music. Hamasaki began commissioning remixes of her songs early in her career, and this practice also influenced the diversity of her music. Found on many of her records, these remixes span different genres of electronic dance music including Eurobeat, house, and trance, as well as acoustic genres such as classical and traditional Chinese music. She has employed Western as well as Japanese musicians; among those she has worked with are Above & Beyond, the Lamoureux Orchestra of France, and traditional Chinese music ensemble Princess China Music Orchestra. Hamasaki has released more than a hundred original songs; through them, she has covered a wide range of musical styles, such as dance, metal, R, progressive rock, pop, and classical. She uses different instruments and techniques including piano, orchestra, gospel choirs, guitars, traditional Japanese strings, music boxes, and effects such as yells, claps, and scratching.|$|E
