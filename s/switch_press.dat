40|$|We have {{developed}} an intelligent single switch scanning interface and wheelchair navigation assistance system, called intelligent single switch wheelchair navigation (ISSWN), to improve driving safety, comfort and efficiency for individuals who rely on single switch scanning as a control method. ISSWN combines a standard powered wheelchair with a laser rangefinder, a single switch scanning interface and a computer. It provides the user with context sensitive and task specific scanning options that reduce driving effort based on an interpretation of sensor data together with user input. Trials performed by 9 able-bodied participants showed that the system significantly improved driving safety and efficiency in a navigation task by significantly {{reducing the number of}} <b>switch</b> <b>presses</b> to 43. 5 % of traditional single switch wheelchair navigation (p < 0. 001).

Implications for Rehabilitation Intelligent navigation algorithm helps investigators develop smart wheelchair technology that may ultimately provide independent mobility to a segment of the population that currently finds it difficult or impossible to operate a conventional wheelchair. intelligent single switch wheelchair navigation improves the driving safety, comfort, and efficiency for individuals who rely on single switch scanning as a wheelchair control method by significantly reducing the number of <b>switch</b> <b>presses</b> and completion time. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Investigators have {{discovered}} that the ratio between a user’s reaction time and an appropriate scan rate for that user is approximately 0. 65, which we refer to as “the. 65 rule. ” As {{part of a larger}} effort to develop software that automatically adapts the configuration of switch access software, data was collected comparing subject performance with a scan rate chosen using the. 65 rule and a scan rate chosen by the user. Analysis of the data indicates that for many people, the. 65 rule produces a scan rate that is approximately the same as the average <b>switch</b> <b>press</b> time plus two standard deviations. BACKGROUND Row-column scanning is a technique used by individuals with significant physical impairments for entering text and other data into computers and augmentative communication devices. A common implementation of row-column scanning with one switch requires three switch hits to make one selection from a two-dimensional matrix of letters, numbers, symbols, words, or phrases, as illustrated in Figure 1. The first switch hit initiates a scan through the rows of the matrix. Each row of the matrix, beginning with the first, is highlighted in turn until the second switch hit is made to select a row. Each column of the row is then highlighted in turn until the target is highlighted, when the third switch hit is made t...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{technical aspects}} of a robot ma-nipulator developed to facilitate learning by young children who are generally unable to grasp objects or speak. The severity of these physical disabilities also limits assessment of their cognitive and language skills and abilities. The CRS robot manipulator was adapted for use by children who have disabilities. Our {{emphasis is on the}} technical control aspects of the development of an inter-face and communication environment between the child and the robot arm. The system is designed so that each child has user con-trol and control procedures that are individually adapted. Con-trol interfaces include large push buttons, keyboards, laser pointer, and head-controlled switches. Preliminary results have shown that young children who have severe disabilities can use the robotic arm system to complete functional play-related tasks. Developed soft-ware allows the child to accomplish a series of multistep tasks by activating one or more single switches. Through a single <b>switch</b> <b>press</b> the child can replay a series of preprogrammed movements that have a development sequence. Children using this system en-gaged in three-step sequential activities and were highly responsive to the robotic tasks. This was in marked contrast to other interven-tions using toys and computer games.
