40|$|The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 3 {{anorexia}} nervosa genome-wide association scan includes 2907 cases from 15 different populations of European origin genotyped on the Illumina 670 K chip. We compared methods for identifying population stratification, and <b>suggest</b> <b>list</b> of markers {{that may help}} to counter this problem. It is usual to identify population structure in such studies using only common variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) > 5 %; we find that this may result in highly informative SNPs being discarded, and suggest that instead all SNPs with MAF > 1 % may be used. We established informative axes of variation identified via principal component analysis and highlight important features of the genetic structure of diverse European-descent populations, some studied {{for the first time}} at this scale. Finally, we investigated the substructure within each of these 15 populations and identified SNPs that help capture hidden stratification. This work can provide information regarding the designing and interpretation of association results in the International Consortia.

40|$|Route {{planning}} is a challenging task {{because it is}} a combination of theoretically well-defined computational problems on one side, and everyday-life decisions and constraints on the other side. This paper presents an approach to sightseeing route planning using theory of computation. In particular, in this paper we discuss the combination of two well-known computational problems: knapsack and travelling salesman, and their practical implementation in everyday life task ‒ route planning. The algorithms are adapted in such way that they find near optimal solution with minimum delay, almost in real-time.
