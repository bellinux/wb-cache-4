5|$|The law {{of large}} numbers predicts that when the {{absolute}} number of copies of the allele is small (e.g., in small populations), the magnitude of drift on allele frequencies per generation is larger. The magnitude of drift {{is large enough to}} overwhelm selection at any allele frequency when the <b>selection</b> <b>coefficient</b> is less than 1 divided by the effective population size. Non-adaptive evolution resulting from the product of mutation and genetic drift is therefore considered to be a consequential mechanism of evolutionary change primarily within small, isolated populations. The mathematics of genetic drift depend on the effective population size, {{but it is not clear}} how this is related to the actual number of individuals in a population. Genetic linkage to other genes that are under selection can reduce the effective population size experienced by a neutral allele. With a higher recombination rate, linkage decreases and with it this local effect on effective population size. This effect is visible in molecular data as a correlation between local recombination rate and genetic diversity, and negative correlation between gene density and diversity at noncoding DNA regions. Stochasticity associated with linkage to other genes that are under selection is not the same as sampling error, and is sometimes known as genetic draft in order to distinguish it from genetic drift.|$|E

Our analytic results are used to predict levels of variation for the entire third chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster. The predictions {{are consistent with the}} low levels of variation that have been observed at loci near the centromeres of the third chromosome of D. melanogaster. However, the low levels of variation observed near the tips of this chromosome are not predicted using currently available estimates of the deleterious mutation rate and of <b>selection</b> <b>coefficients.</b> If considerably smaller <b>selection</b> <b>coefficients</b> are assumed, the low observed levels of variation at the tips of the third chromosome are consistent with the background selection model...|$|R
40|$|Domestication is {{the process}} by which plants or animals evolved to fit a human-managed environment, and it is marked by {{innovations}} in plant morphology and anatomy that are in turn correlated with new human behaviours and technologies for harvesting, storage and field preparation. Archaeobotanical evidence has revealed that domestication was a protracted process taking thousands of plant generations. Within this protracted process there were changes in the selection pressures for domestication traits as well as variation across a geographic mosaic of wild and cultivated populations. Quantitative data allow us to estimate the changing <b>selection</b> <b>coefficients</b> for the evolution of non-shattering (domestic-type seed dispersal) in Asian rice (Oryza sativa L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccon (Shrank) Schübl.) and einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum L.). These data indicate that <b>selection</b> <b>coefficients</b> tended to be low, but also that there were inflection points at which selection increased considerably. For rice, <b>selection</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the order of 0. 001 prior to 5500 BC shifted to greater than 0. 003 between 5000 and 4500 BC, before falling again as the domestication process ended 4000 – 3500 BC. In barley and the two wheats selection was strongest between 8500 and 7500 BC. The slow start of domestication may indicate that initial selection began in the Pleistocene glacial era...|$|R
40|$|Estimation of the {{distribution}} of <b>selection</b> <b>coefficients</b> of mutations is a long-standing issue in molecular evolution. In addition to population-based methods, {{the distribution}} can be estimated from DNA sequence data by phylogenetic-based models. Previous models have generally found unimodal distributions where the probability mass is concentrated between mildly deleterious and nearly neutral mutations. Here we use a sitewise mutation–selection phylogenetic model to estimate the distribution of <b>selection</b> <b>coefficients</b> among novel and fixed mutations (substitutions) in a data set of 244 mammalian mitochondrial genomes and a set of 401 PB 2 proteins from influenza. We find a bimodal distribution of <b>selection</b> <b>coefficients</b> for novel mutations in both the mitochondrial data set and for the influenza protein evolving in its natural reservoir, birds. Most of the mutations are strongly deleterious {{with the rest of the}} probability mass concentrated around mildly deleterious to neutral mutations. The distribution of the coefficients among substitutions is unimodal and symmetrical around nearly neutral substitutions for both data sets at adaptive equilibrium. About 0. 5 % of the nonsynonymous mutations and 14 % of the nonsynonymous substitutions in the mitochondrial proteins are advantageous, with 0. 5 % and 24 % observed for the influenza protein. Following a host shift of influenza from birds to humans, however, we find among novel mutations in PB 2 a trimodal distribution with a small mode of advantageous mutations...|$|R

Despite the fact that the human population went through a constriction more than 150,000years ago that was capable of fixing many loci, the HLA loci appear to have survived such a constriction with a great deal of variation. Of the 9 loci mentioned above, most retained a dozen or more allele-groups for each locus, far more preserved variation than the vast majority of human loci. This is consistent with a heterozygous or balancing <b>selection</b> <b>coefficient</b> for these loci. In addition, some HLA loci are among the fastest-evolving coding regions in the human genome.

We implement this ABC method in a new software and apply it to a classical time-serial dataset of the medionigra genotype in the moth Panaxia dominula.

However, comparison of estimated distributions among studies is hampered by inconsistencies in the definitions of fitness effects and <b>selection</b> <b>coefficients.</b> In particular, the use of ratios of Malthusian growth rates as ‘relative fitnesses’ leads to wrong inference of the strength of selection. Scaling Malthusian fitness by the generation time may help overcome this shortcoming, and allow accurate comparison of <b>selection</b> <b>coefficients</b> across species. For species reproducing by binary fission (neglecting cellular death), ln 2 {{can be used as a}} correction factor, but in general, the growth rate and generation time of the wild-type should be provided in studies reporting distribution of mutation fitness effects.

5000|$|Deleterious {{mutation}} load is {{the main}} contributing factor to genetic load overall. Most mutations are deleterious, and occur at a high rate.

40|$|Characterizing the {{distribution}} of <b>selection</b> <b>coefficients</b> in natural populations remains a central challenge in evolutionary biology. We resequenced a subset of 19 fast-evolving protein-coding genes in the sister species Drosophila miranda and D. pseudoobscura and their flanking regions to characterize the spatial footprint left by recurrent and recent selection. Consistent with previous findings, fast-evolving genes and their flanking regions show reduced levels of neutral diversity compared with randomly chosen genes, as expected under recurrent selection models. Applying a variety of statistical tests designed {{for the detection of}} selection at different evolutionary timescales, we attempt to characterize parameters of adaptive evolution. In D. miranda, fast-evolving genes generally show evidence of increased rates of adaptive evolution relative to random genes, whereas this pattern is somewhat less pronounced in D. pseudoobscura. Our results suggest that fast-evolving genes are not characterized by significantly different <b>selection</b> <b>coefficients</b> but rather a shift in {{the distribution}} of the rate of fixation...|$|R

Of undiseased plants that developed foliar infections during the growing season, 55 % possessed active resistance to the rust disease, {{and were able to}} prevent the foliar infection from becoming a systemic one. Flowering increased the susceptibility of plants to both Mar and systemic infections. A phenotypic selection study was carried out to estimate selection on five plant traits and to determine the role of foliar infections of U. ari-triphylli in mediating selection. Multivariate path analysis suggests that both leaf diameter and a general size factor are under positive directional <b>selection.</b> Pathogen-mediated <b>selection</b> <b>coefficients</b> are small, but comparable in magnitude to overall <b>selection</b> <b>coefficients</b> (15 %, on average), indicating the potential importance of diseases as selective agents in nature...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{conflict}} at loci influencing traits shared {{between the}} sexes occurs when sex-specific selection pressures are antagonistic relative to the genetic correlation {{between the sexes}}. To assess whether there is sexual conflict over shared traits, we estimated heritability and intersexual genetic correlations for highly sexually dimorphic traits (horn volume and body mass) in a wild population of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) and quantified sex-specific selection using estimates of longevity and lifetime reproductive success. Body mass and horn volume showed significant additive genetic variance in both sexes, and intersexual genetic correlations were 0. 24 ± 0. 28 for horn volume and 0. 63 ± 0. 30 for body mass. For horn volume, <b>selection</b> <b>coefficients</b> did not significantly differ from zero in either sex. For body weight, <b>selection</b> <b>coefficients</b> were positive in females but {{did not differ from}} zero in males.

There are, nevertheless, few results on multilocus models when both {{random genetic drift}} and natural {{selection}} affect the evolutionary dynamics. In this paper we describe a formalism to calculate systematic perturbation expansions of moments of allelic states around neutrality in populations of constant size. This allows us to evaluate multilocus fixation probabilities (long-term limits of the moments) under arbitrary strength of selection and gene action. We show that such fixation probabilities can be {{expressed in terms of}} <b>selection</b> <b>coefficients</b> weighted by mean first passages times of ancestral gene lineages within a single ancestor. These passage times extend the coalescence times that weight <b>selection</b> <b>coefficients</b> in one-locus perturbation formulas for fixation probabilities. We then apply these results to investigate the Hill-Robertson effect and the coevolution of helping and punishment. Finally, we discuss limitations and strengths of the perturbation approach. In particular, it provides accurate approximations for fixation probabilities for weak selection regimes only (Ns < or = 1), but it provides generally good prediction for the direction of selection under frequency-dependent selection...|$|R

The population dynamics of nearly neutral mutations is essentially {{the same as that of}} neutral mutations unless the absolute magnitude of the <b>selection</b> <b>coefficient</b> is greater than 1/N, where N is the effective population size with respect to selection. The value of N may therefore affect how many mutations can be treated as neutral and how many as deleterious.|$|E
50|$|In an {{idealised}} Wright-Fisher model, {{the fate}} of an allele, beginning at an intermediate frequency, is largely determined by selection if the <b>selection</b> <b>coefficient</b> s >> 1/N, and largely determined by neutral genetic drift if s << 1/N. In real populations, the cutoff value of s may depend instead on local recombination rates. This limit to selection in a real population may be captured in a toy Wright-Fisher simulation through the appropriate choice of Ne. Populations with different selection effective population sizes are predicted to evolve profoundly different genome architectures.|$|E

Using a variation of Haldane and Jayakar's (1964) parameterization of selection on an X-linked locus, analytical expressions are derived for the proportion of the total parameter space (P) in which stable diallelic polymorphism is attained. P {{is a function of the}} ratio of <b>selection</b> <b>coefficients</b> (r) associated with homozygous and hemizygous genotypes, and the intensity of selection (s). Analytical expressions for the opportunity for polymorphism at an autosomal locus (Pa) are also derived for comparison to the X-linked case. P and Pa are maximal and equal if the ratios of <b>selection</b> <b>coefficients</b> are - 1 and selection is intense. Otherwise, P is slightly less than Pa, but the difference between autosomal and sex-linked loci is less than the range of values of P obtained over the range of r.

Population-selectivity refers to a scaled version of the age- or size-specific fishing mortality experienced by a fish population.

Temporal variation in population-selectivity has important implications for the conduct of fisheries modelling activities such as evaluating management strategies and forecasting catch and stock size.
