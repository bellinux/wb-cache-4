However, boundaries defining the western termination zone is currently unclear (see Puget Sound faults#Question of western termination). [...] It is the northern edge of the Seattle Uplift, of which the Tacoma Fault is the southern edge. [...] One model has the Seattle and Tacoma faults converging at depth to form a wedge, which is being popped up by approximately northsouth oriented compression that ultimately derives from plate tectonics. [...] Another model (see diagram) interprets the Seattle Uplift as a sheet of rock that is being forced up a ramp. [...] Subsequent work suggests that the structure of the Seattle Fault may vary from east to west, with both models being applicable in different sections.

60|$|If {{the night}} {{had been so}} memorable, the picture {{presented}} {{at the dawn of}} day, was not less so! We reached that lofty look-out about the same time in the morning as the Indian had awakened me on the previous occasion, and had the same natural outlines to the view. In one sense, also, the artificial accessaries were the same, though exhibited under a very different aspect. I presume the truth will not be much, if any exceeded, when I say that a thousand boats were in sight, on this, as on the former occasion! A few, a dozen or so, at most, appeared to have reached the head of the lake; but all the rest of that vast flotilla was scattered along the placid surface of the lovely <b>sheet,</b> <b>forming</b> a long, straggling line of dark spots, that extended to the beach under Fort William Henry, in one direction, and far as eye could reach in the other. How different did that melancholy, broken procession of boats appear, from the gallant array, the martial bands, the cheerful troops, and the multitude of ardent young men who had pressed forward, in brigades, less than a week before, filled with hope, and exulting in their strength! As I gazed on the picture I could not but fancy to myself the vast amount of physical pain, the keen mental suffering, and the deep mortification that might have been found, amid that horde of returning adventurers. We had just come up from the level of this scene of human agony, and our imaginations could portray details that were {{beyond the reach of the}} senses, at the elevation on which we stood.|$|E

This is a simple variation of vacuum or pressure forming without prestretching, i.e. a single stage forming, into a female mould with heating of the plastic sheet using a contact heating plate inside the forming station. The forming air is supplied via through holes in the heating plate. Still in a laboratory scale process, diverse thermoplastic films also from biodegradable polymers such as polycaprolactone (PCL) with thicknesses typically between 20 and 100 µm are thermoformed. This is performed with gas pressures up to 5 MPa into mechanically micromachined cavities of plate shaped micromoulds from brass.|$|E
