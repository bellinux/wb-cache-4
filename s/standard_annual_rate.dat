The new national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS- 2012), which includes the monitoring of PM 2. 5, has posed stricter standards for evaluating air quality. With the new national standard, the air quality in Beijing is calculated using both NAAQS- 2012 and the previous <b>standard.</b> The <b>annual</b> attainment <b>rate</b> has dropped from 75. 5 % to 50. 7 %. The spatial analysis of air quality shows that only a background station could attain the national standard, while urban and suburban stations exceed the national standard. Among the six pollutants included in the NAAQS- 2012, PM 2. 5 is the major contributor to the air quality index (AQI) comparing with the five other pollutants. The results indicate that under previous NAAQS without PM 2. 5 monitoring, the air quality has improved greatly in the past decade.   By considering PM 2. 5, the air quality attainment has dropped greatly. Furthermore, a great effort is needed for local government to bring down the PM 2. 5 concentration...|$|R
