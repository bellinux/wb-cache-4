5|$|The {{triangular}} {{spots of}} the spotted green pigeon {{are not unique}} among pigeons, but are also seen in the spot-winged pigeon (Columba maculosa) and the <b>speckled</b> <b>pigeon</b> (C. guinea), and {{are the result of}} lack of melanin deposition during development. The yellow-buff coloured spots are very worn, while less worn feathers have white tips; this indicates that the former were stained during life or represent a different stage of plumage, and that the latter were fresher. The plumage of the spotted green pigeon was distinct in being very soft compared to that of other pigeons, perhaps due to the body feathers being proportionally long. The hackles were not as elongated as those of the Nicobar pigeon, and the feathers did not differ from those of other pigeons in their microstructure. The plumage was also distinct in being very pigmented, except for the tips of the feathers, and even the down was dark, unlike that of most other birds (a feature otherwise seen in aberrant plumage).|$|E
50|$|The <b>speckled</b> <b>pigeon</b> is {{frequently}} seen around human habitation and cultivation. Most of its food is vegetable, and it gathers {{in large numbers}} where grain or groundnuts are available.|$|E
50|$|The <b>speckled</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba guinea), or (African) rock pigeon, is {{a pigeon}} {{that is a}} {{resident}} breeding bird in much of Africa south of the Sahara. It is a common and widespread species in open habitats over much of its range, although there are sizable gaps in its distribution.|$|E
50|$|On , the {{aircraft}} was due operate the second {{leg of a}} domestic scheduled Addis Ababa-Bahir Dar-Asmara passenger service with 104 occupants on board, of whom 98 were passengers. Both engines of {{the aircraft}} ingested a flock of <b>speckled</b> <b>pigeons</b> as it took off from Bahir Dar Airport, and subsequently overheated. One of the engines immediately lost thrust, while the other did so on the emergency return to the departure airport. During a gear-up landing, the aircraft caught fire.|$|R
50|$|The <b>speckled</b> wood <b>pigeon</b> (Columba hodgsonii) is a {{medium-sized}} pigeon of the Columbidae family which lives in montane forests of Kashmir to Northeast India, eastern Tibet, central China, Yunnan and Myanmar.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper body}} of the <b>speckled</b> wood <b>pigeon</b> is maroon-brown except for its neck, which, like many pigeons, is iridescent. Its lower body {{features}} the speckles which give it its name. The bird is 38 centimeters in length.|$|R
50|$|Several {{species such}} as golden nightjar, Sudan golden sparrow, hooded vulture, dark {{chanting}} goshawk, <b>speckled</b> <b>pigeon,</b> African mourning dove, blue-naped mousebird, Kordofan lark, red-chested swallow, chestnut-bellied starling, African swallow-tailed kite, tawny eagle, slender-billed curlew, demoiselle crane, Arabian bustard, ostrich, lappet-faced vulture, helmeted guineafowl are seemingly locally rare or extinct, or rather visitors of vagrants.|$|E
50|$|The Somali pigeon or Somali {{stock dove}} (Columba oliviae) is {{a species of}} bird in the family Columbidae. It is endemic to {{northern}} Somalia. Because there has hardly been any research on the species, {{the health of the}} population is uncertain. However, {{it has been suggested that}} the species is relatively rare. The IUCN Redlist identified a possible threat to the species from the <b>speckled</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba guinea).|$|E
50|$|It has {{a varied}} diet which {{includes}} small mammals (70% of items) and adult birds, fledglings, lizards, frogs and large insects. Birds {{up to the}} size of Red-billed teal and <b>speckled</b> <b>pigeon.</b> A favoured prey in some areas are doves, especially laughing dove. African marsh harriers are not found in areas with less than 300mm annual rainfall as wetlands are sparse in regions with less rainfall, its main prey in southern Africa, the striped mouse Rhabdomys pumilio , is also restricted to this isohyet. It will also feed on larger animals such as flamingoes carrion left by, for example, African fish eagle. Most prey is caught on the ground but birds and insects often caught on the wing.|$|E
50|$|Birds at Pangolakha Wildlife Sanctuary include kalij pheasant, Oriental honey buzzard, blood pheasant, white-crested laughingthrush, {{striated}} laughingthrush, chestnut-crowned laughingthrush, bar-throated minla, red-tailed minla, white-browed shrike babbler, white-browed fulvetta, rufous sibia, whiskered yuhina, stripe-throated yuhina, rufous-vented yuhina, brown dipper, rusty-flanked treecreeper, dark-rumped rosefinch, little bunting, etc. It is {{also home}} for some rarities like the <b>speckled</b> wood <b>pigeon</b> and bay woodpecker.|$|R
50|$|The Free Range Aviary is home {{tropical}} forest dwelling birds such as pink pigeon, mountain peacock-pheasant, ringed teal, silver-eared mesia, scarlet-chested parrot, pheasant pigeon, Gouldian finch, sunbittern, common emerald dove, Victoria crowned <b>pigeon,</b> <b>speckled</b> mousebird, and mountain bamboo partridge. Within the aviary are some enclosed animal exhibits that {{are home to}} animals such as scarlet macaws and golden-headed lion tamarins.|$|R
5000|$|Finally, {{there are}} pigeon {{feathers}} on the floor, which Captain Darling and Melchett {{believe to be}} white. But after Baldrick {{points out that the}} feathers are [...] "speckly," [...] Melchett is enraged, as it was his beloved pet <b>pigeon</b> <b>Speckled</b> Jim, and tries to strike Blackadder, forcing Darling to physically restrain Melchett. Smugly, Darling then informs Blackadder that he's under arrest and, if found guilty at court-martial, he will face execution by firing squad.|$|R

30|$|Feral pigeons {{were first}} {{introduced}} by early Europeans to Southern Africa as a free-flying domesticated {{species in the}} seventeenth century (Brooke 1981). However populations both feral (Columba livia Gmelin 1789) and indigenous (<b>speckled</b> <b>pigeon</b> Columba guinea Linnaeus 1758) have since populated urban regions throughout the subcontinent. Urban resources and lifestyles associated with human activity have enabled pigeons to establish populations {{as a result of the}} available supply and distribution of food and breeding space (Haag-Wackernagel 1995) resulting in them being considered as the most successful avian coloniser of urban spaces.|$|E
5000|$|The {{rock dove}} was first {{described}} by Gmelin in 1789. The genus name Columba is the Latin word meaning [...] "pigeon, dove", whose older etymology {{comes from the}} Ancient Greek κόλυμβος (kolumbos), [...] "a diver", from κολυμβάω (kolumbao), [...] "dive, plunge headlong, swim". Aristophanes (Birds, 304) and others use the word κολυμβίς (kolumbis), [...] "diver", {{for the name of}} the bird, because of its swimming motion in the air. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin livor, [...] "bluish". Its closest relative in the Columba genus is the hill pigeon, followed by the other rock pigeons: the snow, <b>speckled</b> and white-collared <b>pigeons.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{next room}} was still larger, {{but it was}} also much more crowded. Apparently Piero was keeping the Festa, for the double door {{underneath}} the window which admitted the painter's light from above, was thrown open, and showed a garden, or rather thicket, in which fig-trees and vines grew in tangled trailing wildness among nettles and hemlocks, and a tall cypress lifted its dark head from a stifling mass of yellowish mulberry-leaves. It seemed as if that dank luxuriance had begun to penetrate even within the walls of the wide and lofty room; for in one corner, amidst a confused heap of carved marble fragments and rusty armour, tufts of long grass and dark feathery fennel had made their way, and a large stone vase, tilted on one side, seemed to be pouring out the ivy that streamed around. All about the walls hung pen and oil-sketches of fantastic sea-monsters; dances of satyrs and maenads; Saint Margaret's resurrection out of the devouring dragon; Madonnas with the supernal light upon them; studies of plants and grotesque heads; and on irregular rough shelves a few books were scattered among great drooping bunches of corn, bullocks' horns, pieces of dried honeycomb, stones with patches of rare-coloured lichen, skulls and bones, peacocks' feathers, and large birds' wings. Rising from amongst the dirty litter of the floor were lay figures: one in the frock of a Vallombrosan monk, strangely surmounted by a helmet with barred visor, another smothered with brocade and skins hastily tossed over it. Amongst this heterogeneous still life, several <b>speckled</b> and white <b>pigeons</b> were perched or strutting, too tame to fly at the entrance of men; three corpulent toads were crawling in an intimate friendly way near the door-stone; and a white rabbit, apparently the model for that which was frightening Cupid in the picture of Mars and Venus placed on the central easel, was twitching its nose with much content on a box full of bran.|$|R
