40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the nonlinear mean-field shift in a multi-component Bose-Einstein condensate may be eliminated by controlling the two-body interaction coefficients. This modification is achieved by, e. g., <b>suitably</b> <b>engineering</b> {{the environment of the}} condensate. We consider as an example the case of a two-component condensate in a tightly confining atom waveguide. Modification of the atom-atom interactions is then achieved by varying independently the transverse wave function of the two components. Eliminating the density dependent phase shift in a high-density atomic beam has important applications in atom interferometry and precision measurement...|$|E
40|$|Controlling the non-Markovian {{dynamics}} of open quantum systems {{is essential in}} quantum information technology since it {{plays a crucial role}} in preserving quantum memory. Albeit in many realistic scenarios the quantum system can simultaneously interact with composite environments, this condition remains little understood, particularly regarding the effect of the coupling between environmental parts. We analyze the non-Markovian behavior of a qubit interacting at the same time with two coupled single-mode cavities which in turn dissipate into memoryless or memory-keeping reservoirs. We show that increasing the control parameter, that is the two-mode coupling, allows for triggering and enhancing a non-Markovian dynamics for the qubit starting from a Markovian one in absence of coupling. Surprisingly, if the qubit dynamics is non-Markovian for zero control parameter, increasing the latter enables multiple transitions from non-Markovian to Markovian regimes. These results hold independently {{on the nature of the}} reservoirs. This work highlights that <b>suitably</b> <b>engineering</b> the coupling between parts of a compound environment can efficiently harness the quantum memory, stored in a qubit, based on non-Markovianity.

40|$|Integrated optics {{provides}} the {{platform for the}} experimental implementation of highly complex and compact circuits for quantum information applications. In this context integrated waveguide sources represent a powerful resource for the generation of quantum states of light due to their high brightness and stability. However, the confinement of the light in a single spatial mode limits the realization of multi-channel sources. Due to this challenge {{one of the most}} adopted sources in quantum information processes, i. e. a source which generates spectrally indistinguishable polarization entangled photons in two different spatial modes, has not yet been realized in a fully integrated platform. Here we overcome this limitation by <b>suitably</b> <b>engineering</b> two periodically poled waveguides and an integrated polarization splitter in lithium niobate. This source produces polarization entangled states with fidelity of F = 0. 973 (3) and a test of Bell's inequality results in a violation larger than 14 standard deviations. It can work both in pulsed and continuous wave regime. This device represents a new step toward the implementation of fully integrated circuits for quantum information applications.

40|$|The growing {{importance}} of software {{and its role}} in society places greater emphasis on developing <b>suitably</b> skilled software <b>engineering</b> graduates. In developing suitable curricula, it is vital that we understand standard models of software education, the educational processes and outcomes for the students. This is important not only for students completing a software engineering degree, but also once they have graduated and used their skills as practitioners. Here, we report on a survey of past students who have completed an undergraduate degree in software engineering and compare their perceptions with current efforts to standardise undergraduate software engineering curricula...|$|R
40|$|As {{a global}} profession, {{engineering}} {{is integral to}} the maintenance and further development of society. Indeed, contemporary social problems requiring engineering solutions are not only a consequence of natural and ‘manmade’ disasters (such as the Japanese earthquake or the oil leakage in the Gulf of Mexico) but also encapsulate 21 st Century dilemmas around sustainability, poverty and pollution [2, 6, 7]. Given the complexity of such problems and the constant need for innovation, the demand for engineering education to provide a ready supply of <b>suitably</b> qualified <b>engineering</b> graduates, able to make innovative decisions has never been higher [3, 5]. Bearing this in mind, and taking account problems of attrition in engineering education [1, 6, 4] innovation {{in the way in}} which the curriculum is developed and delivered is crucial. CDIO [Conceive, Design, Implement, Operate] provides a potentially ground-breaking solution to such dilemmas. Aimed at equipping students with practical engineering skills supported by the necessary theoretical background, CDIO could potentially change the way engineering is perceived and experienced within higher education. Aston University introduced CDIO into its Mechanical Engineering and Design programmes in October 2011. From its induction, engineering education researchers have ‘shadowed’ the staff responsible for developing and teaching the programme. Utilising an Action Research Design, and adopting a mixed methodological research design, the researchers have worked closely with the teaching team to critically reflect on the processes involved in introducing CDIO into the curriculum. Concurrently, research has been conducted to capture students’ perspectives of CDIO. In evaluating the introduction of CDIO at Aston, the researchers have developed a distinctive research strategy with which to evaluate CDIO. It is the emergent findings from this research that form the basis of this paper. Although early-on in its development CDIO is making a significant difference to engineering education at the University. The paper draws attention to pedagogical, practical and professional issues – discussing each one in turn and in doing so critically analysing the value of CDIO from academic, student and industrial perspectives. The paper concludes by noting that whilst CDIO represents a forwardthinking approach to engineering education, the need for constant innovation in learning and teaching should not be forgotten. Indeed, engineering education needs to put itself at the forefront of pedagogic practice. Providing all-rounded engineers, ready to take on the challenges of the 21 st Century...|$|R
40|$|The {{engineering}} of broadband absorbers {{to harvest}} white light in thin-film semiconductors {{is a major}} challenge in developing renewable materials for energy harvesting. Many solution-processed materials with high manufacturability and low cost, such as semiconductor quantum dots, {{require the use of}} film structures with thicknesses on the order of 1 μm to absorb incoming photons completely. The electron transport lengths in these media, however, are 1 order of magnitude smaller than this length, hampering further progress with this platform. Herein, we show that, by <b>engineering</b> <b>suitably</b> disordered nanoplasmonic structures, we have created a new class of dispersionless epsilon-near-zero composite materials that efficiently harness white light. Our nanostructures localize light in the dielectric region outside the epsilon-near-zero material with characteristic lengths of 10 - 100 nm, resulting in an efficient system for harvesting broadband light when a thin absorptive film is deposited on top of the structure. By using a combination of theory and experiments, we demonstrate that ultrathin layers down to 50 nm of colloidal quantum dots deposited atop the epsilon-near-zero material show an increase in broadband absorption ranging from 200 % to 500 % compared to a planar structure of the same colloidal quantum-dot-absorber average thickness. When the epsilon-near-zero nanostructures were used in an energy-harvesting module, we observed a spectrally averaged 170 % broadband increase in the external quantum efficiency of the device, measured at wavelengths between 400 and 1200 nm. Atomic force microscopy and photoluminescence excitation measurements demonstrate that the properties of these epsilon-near-zero structures apply to general metals and could be used to enhance the near-field absorption of semiconductor structures more widely. We have developed an inexpensive electrochemical deposition process that enables scaled-up production of this nanomaterial for large-scale energy-harvesting applications...|$|R
40|$|Pointer {{states are}} {{long-lasting}} high-fidelity states in open quantum systems. We show how any pure {{state in a}} non-Markovian open quantum system {{can be made to}} behave as a pointer state by <b>suitably</b> <b>engineering</b> the coupling to the environment via open-loop periodic control. Engineered pointer states are constructed as approximate fixed points of the controlled open-system dynamics, {{in such a way that}} they are guaranteed to survive over a long time with a fidelity determined by the relative precision with which the dynamics is engineered. We provide quantitative minimum-fidelity bounds by identifying symmetry and ergodicity conditions that the decoherence-inducing perturbation must obey in the presence of control, and develop explicit pulse sequences for engineering any desired set of orthogonal states as pointer states. These general control protocols are validated through exact numerical simulations as well as semi-classical approximations in realistic single and two qubit dissipative systems. We also examine the role of control imperfections, and show that while pointer-state engineering protocols are highly robust in the presence of systematic pulse errors, the latter can also lead to unintended pointer-state generation in dynamical decoupling implementations, explaining the initial-state selectivity observed in recent experiments.

40|$|Periodically driven quantum systems {{offer an}} {{exceptional}} platform for quantum simulations {{due to the}} possibility to approximate their dynamics in terms of time-independent effective Hamiltonians. This, together with the recent experimental advances, has situated driven systems at center stage of engineered quantum-mechanical devices. The aim of this thesis is to develop theoretical methods in order to design optimal quantum simulations with driven systems. By applying the derived tools to experimentally relevant models, the applicability and significance of the methods are furthermore demonstrated. First, we introduce a method to derive accurate effective Hamiltonians by merging two seemingly unrelated tools: Floquet theory and flow equations. With this, the required analytical identification of the effective Hamiltonian {{in terms of the}} system's parameters is achieved. Second, we identify structural properties that determine the accessible effective dynamics of a system of particles on shaken optical lattices, which is arguably {{one of the most remarkable}} systems for many-body quantum simulations. In particular, we identify fundamental symmetries of the underlying lattice geometry that determine the emergence of new tunneling processes. Third, we develop an optimal control scheme to design polychromatic driving protocols that optimally simulate specifically targeted dynamics. We apply this scheme to demonstrate an optimal realization of Raman transitions with a Lambda system, a building block in many quantum simulations. Then, we employ it to implement a topological Chern insulator through <b>suitably</b> <b>engineering</b> the geometry-dependent tunneling of particles on a shaken hexagonal lattice. Hereby, a realistic route to experimentally test strongly-correlated topological phases of matter is provided. By determining structural properties of driven systems and suitable driving protocols, the methods described in this thesis open substantial possibilities for the development of optimal quantum simulations and, ultimately, reliable quantum technologies.
