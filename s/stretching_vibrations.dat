50|$|The {{vibrational}} {{spectra of}} many oxohalides {{have been assigned}} in detail. They give useful information on relative bond strengths. For example, in CrO2F2, the Cr-O <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations</b> are at 1006 cm−1 and 1016 cm−1 and the Cr-F <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations</b> are at 727 cm−1 and 789 cm−1. The difference is much too large {{to be due to}} the different masses of O and F atoms. Rather, it shows that the Cr-O bond is much stronger than the Cr-F bond. M-O bonds are generally considered to be double bonds and this is backed up by measurements of M-O bond lengths. It implies that the elements A and O are chemically bound together by a σ bond and a π bond.|$|E

30|$|For the APTMS-coated {{iron oxide}} nanoparticles, the peaks at 1700 and 1648  cm− 1 {{are due to}} the <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> of C = O and <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> of C = C bonds, respectively. The peaks at 1172 and 1017  cm− 1 are due to the <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> of C–O. The {{asymmetric}} <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> and scissoring bending vibration of CH 2 group are represented by peaks at 2926 and 1460  cm− 1, respectively [61]. This is evident from Fig.  6 b.|$|R
30|$|Two intense {{absorption}} bands were observed at 1731  cm− 1 and at 1226  cm− 1, {{which may be}} related to the <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> of the ester carbonyl group (C=O) and the <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> of ester C–O–C=O group, respectively. This suggests that a polyester was present in the paint formulation.|$|R
30|$|Curve (b) {{shows the}} FTIR {{spectrum}} of PA. The sharp peak at 2847  cm− 1 was {{resulted from the}} <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> of CH 2 groups and the peak at 2915  cm− 1 {{was caused by the}} <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> of CH 3 group in the PA structure. The absorption band from 2500 to 3300  cm− 1 belongs to the <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> of –OH group and the peaks at 1694 and 940  cm− 1 were related to the stretching of C=O and the out of plane bending of –OH, respectively. [28, 40].|$|R
50|$|The uranyl ion has {{characteristic}} νU-O <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations</b> at ca. 880 cm−1 (Raman spectrum) and 950 cm−1 (infrared spectrum). These frequencies depend somewhat {{on which}} ligands {{are present in}} the equatorial plane. Correlations are available between the stretching frequency and U-O bond length. It has also been observed that the stretching frequency correlates with the position of the equatorial ligands in the spectrochemical series.|$|E
50|$|Infrared {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} used to obtain information about the different conformations of the methanium ion. The IR spectrum of plain methane has two C-H bands from symmetric and asymmetric stretching at around 3000 cm−1 and two bands around 1400 cm−1 from symmetrical and asymmetric bending vibrations. In the spectrum of CH5+ three asymmetric <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations</b> are present around 2800 - 3000 cm−1, a rocking vibration at 1300 cm−1, and a bending vibration at 1100 1300 cm−1.|$|E
50|$|When the OH {{group is}} bound to a metal ion in a {{coordination}} complex, an M−OH bending mode can be observed. For example, in Sn(OH)62− it occurs at 1065 cm−1. The bending mode for a bridging hydroxide tends {{to be at a}} lower frequency as in (bipyridine)Cu(OH)2Cu(bipyridine)2+ (955 cm−1). M−OH <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations</b> occur below about 600 cm−1. For example, the tetrahedral ion Zn(OH)42− has bands at 470 cm−1 (Raman-active, polarized) and 420 cm−1 (infrared). The same ion has a (HO)-Zn-(OH) bending vibration at 300 cm−1.|$|E

30|$|In FTIR {{spectrum}} of fabricated PANI-NCC (Fig.  2 a), new bands appeared at 1530 and 1458  cm− 1 with equal intensity (Fig.  2 b) {{are linked to}} C=N (<b>stretching</b> <b>vibration)</b> of quinonoid ring and C=C (<b>stretching</b> <b>vibration)</b> of benzenoid ring, respectively, while band at 1265  cm− 1 is allied to C=N (<b>stretching</b> <b>vibration)</b> of secondary amine (Shyaa et al. 2015), demonstrating the attendance of amine functionalities {{on the surface of}} PANI-NCC. Furthermore, the quantitative estimation amine functionalities were determined by volumetric method and found to be 8.9  mmol g− 1. These results confirm the facile fabrication of PANI-NCC.|$|R
30|$|As {{compared}} with CHP spectra, data for CHSP spectra were 1710  cm− 1 (–C=O <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> peak), 1158  cm− 1 (–C=O <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> peak), 1560  cm− 1 (double –C=O coupling vibration peak), and 1421  cm− 1 (–O–H bending vibration peak). This {{shows that there}} were carboxyl groups on CHP and part of them became salts.|$|R
50|$|If the zero-point energy {{difference}} between the <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations</b> of a carbon-hydrogen and carbon-deuterium bond is allowed to disappear in the transition state, the expression given above predicts a maximum for kH/kD as 6.9. If the weakening of two bending vibrations are also taken into account, kH/kD values as large as 15-20 can be predicted. Bending frequencies are very unlikely to vanish in the transition state, however, and quite few kH/kD values exceed 7-8 near room temperature. Furthermore, it is often found that tunneling {{is a major factor}} when they do exceed such values. Hence, more often than not, weakening of bending frequencies is not an important cause of large kinetic isotope effects.|$|E
5000|$|Absorptions in {{the visible}} {{spectrum}} are usually attributed to excitations of electronic energy states in matter. Water {{is a simple}} three-atom molecule, H2O, and all its electronic absorptions occur in the ultraviolet region {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} and are therefore not responsible for the color of water in the visible region of the spectrum. The water molecule has three fundamental modes of vibration. Two <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations</b> of the O-H bonds occur at v1 = 3650 cm−1 and v3 = 3755 cm−1. Absorption due to these vibrations occurs in the infrared region of the spectrum. The absorption in the visible spectrum is due mainly to the harmonic v1 + 3v3 [...] = 14,318 cm−1, which is equivalent to a wavelength of 698 nm.|$|E
50|$|The {{infrared}} spectrum of liquid water {{is dominated by}} the intense absorption due to the fundamental O-H <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations.</b> Because of the high intensity, very short path lengths, usually less than 50 μm, are needed to record the spectra of aqueous solutions. There is no rotational fine structure, but the absorption band are broader than might be expected, because of hydrogen bonding. Peak maxima for liquid water are observed at 3450 cm−1 (2.898 μm), 3615 cm−1 (2.766 μm) and 1640 cm −1 (6.097 μm). Direct measurement of the infrared spectra of aqueous solutions requires that the cuvette windows be made of substances such as calcium fluoride which are water-insoluble. This difficulty can be overcome by using an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) device.|$|E
3000|$|The FTIR {{spectrum}} of as-synthesized Pt@Cu nanostructures {{is shown in}} Fig.  6 b. The formation of Pt@Cu nanostructures shows distinctive differences in the shape and positions of peaks, indicating the existence of interaction between Pt 4 + and Cu 2 + ion mixture and the responsible functional group of phytoconstituents for the synthesis of Pt@Cu nanostructures. There are appearances of new peaks at 3950 and 3749  cm− 1 which represent the N–H <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> of amines. The broad peak observed for the aqueous leaf extract at 3427  cm− 1 {{which is due to}} OH <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> disappeared completely in the {{spectrum of}} as-synthesized Pt@Cu which could be due to the involvement of this functional group in bioreduction process. Other new peaks at 2380, 2341 and 1845  cm− 1 can be ascribed to C≡N [...] or [...] [...] C≡C [...] <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> and >C=O <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> of carbonyl compounds, respectively. The sharp peak observed for the aqueous leaf extract at 1635  cm− 1 also slightly shifted to 1637  cm− 1 in the spectrum of bimetallic Pt@Cu nanostructures, and could be ascribed to >C=C< stretching vibration of aromatic ring. Peaks at 1463 – 1319  cm− 1 could be assigned to CH 3 antisymmetric deformation in aliphatic compounds or in-plane OH bending vibration of carboxylic acids. The peak at 1118  cm− 1 could be ascribed to C–O <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> of ester. The band at 574  cm− 1 corresponds to Cu–O <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration.</b>|$|R

30|$|The electrospun gelatin (Chi 0) {{spectrum}} illustrated several characteristic {{absorption bands}} at 1670  cm− 1 for amid 1 (C=O) <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration,</b> 1550  cm− 1 for amid 2 (N–H) bending vibration, 1465  cm− 1 for CH 2 bending, 1262  cm− 1 for amid 3 (C–N) <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> and 1160  cm− 1 for –C–O stretching (Al-Saidi et al. 2012; Bin Ahmad et al. 2011; Lai et al. 2012; Nguyen and Lee 2010). The electrospun chitosan (Chi 100) spectrum exhibited strong peak at 1680  cm− 1 with a shoulder around 1645  cm− 1 and a peak at 1566  cm− 1 for C=O <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration,</b> vibration of amine group and ammonium ions, respectively (Haider et al. 2010; Qian et al. 2011). The peak at 1803 represents CO–F group. The Chi 100 spectrum displayed also some peaks at 1442, 1415 and 1351  cm− 1 for C–H bending vibration, 1093 and 1157  cm− 1 for C–O <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> (Bin Ahmad et al. 2011; Dhandayuthapani et al. 2010; Yin et al. 2003).|$|R
50|$|The {{magnitudes}} of such secondary isotope effects at the α-carbon {{are largely}} {{determined by the}} Cα-H(D) vibrations. For an SN1 reaction, since the carbon is converted into an sp2 hybridized carbenium ion during the transition state for the rate-determining step {{with an increase in}} Cα-H(D) bond order, an inverse kinetic isotope effect would be expected if only the <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations</b> were important. The observed large normal kinetic isotope effects are found to be caused by significant out-of-plane bending vibrational contributions when going from the reactants to the transition state of carbenium formation. For SN2 reactions, bending vibrations still play an important role for the kinetic isotope effect, but stretching vibrational contributions are of more comparable magnitude, and the resulting kinetic isotope effect may be normal or inverse depending on the specific contributions of the respective vibrations.|$|E
5000|$|The water {{molecule}} is {{an important}} example of this class of molecule, particularly {{because of the presence}} of water vapor in the atmosphere. The low-resolution spectrum shown in green illustrates the complexity of the spectrum. At wavelengths greater than 10 μm (or wavenumbers less than 1000 cm−1) the absorption is due to pure rotation. The band around 6.3 μm (1590 cm−1) is due to the HOH bending vibration; the considerable breadth of this band is due to the presence of extensive rotational fine structure. High-resolution spectra of this band are shown in Allen and Cross, p 221. [...] The symmetric and asymmetric <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations</b> are close to each other, so the rotational fine structures of these bands overlap. The bands at shorter wavelength are overtones and combination bands, all of which show rotational fine structure. Medium resolution spectra of the bands around 1600 cm−1 and 3700 cm−1 are shown in Banwell and McCash, p91.|$|E
50|$|The water {{molecule}} {{has three}} fundamental molecular vibrations. The O-H <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations</b> {{give rise to}} absorption bands with band origins at 3657 cm−1 (ν1, 2.734 μm) and 3756 cm−1 (ν3, 2.662 μm) in the gas phase. The asymmetric stretching vibration, of B2 symmetry in the point group C2v is a normal vibration. The H-O-H bending mode origin is at 1595 cm−1 (ν2, 6.269 μm). Both symmetric stretching and bending vibrations have A1 symmetry, but the frequency difference between them is so large that mixing is effectively zero. In the gas phase all three bands show extensive rotational fine structure.ν3 has a series of overtones at wavenumbers somewhat less than n ν3, n=2,3,4,5... Combination bands, such as ν2 + ν3 are also easily observed in the near infrared region. The presence of water vapor in the atmosphere is important for atmospheric chemistry especially as the infrared and near infrared spectra are easy to observe. Standard (atmospheric optical) codes are assigned to absorption bands as follows. 0.718 μm (visible): α, 0.810 μm: μ, 0.935 μm: ρστ, 1.13 μm: φ, 1.38 μm: ψ, 1.88 μm: Ω, 2.68 μm: X. The gaps between the bands define the infrared window in the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
30|$|The <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> of intermolecular {{hydrogen}} bond (O–H) is between 3500 and 3200  cm− 1, characteristic peaks of B–O bond is between 1430 and 1355  cm− 1, the <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> of C–O is between 1300 and 1000  cm− 1, and surface curvature of O–H is between 769 and 659  cm− 1.

30|$|The band at 3, 066 cm− 1 in GERS {{spectra of}} Thy, which is {{attributed}} to the aromatic C(6)-H <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration,</b> is strongly enhanced, while the band at 2, 932 cm− 1, which is assigned to the symmetric CH 3 <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration,</b> is decreased (Figure  3). The possible orientation of Thy {{with respect to the}} graphene surface and binding sites between adsorbed molecules and graphene needs additional investigations and discussions.|$|R

The <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> of Ti-O-Ti is observed at 1388  cm− 1, and the adsorption peaks around 521  cm− 1 is assigned to the bending vibrations of Ti-O bond.|$|R
5000|$|Mesoionic carbenes (MICs) in {{chemistry}} are {{a type of}} reactive intermediate, related to carbenes and of some importance to scientific research. They are similar to N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) except that canonical resonance structures with the carbene depicted cannot be drawn without adding additional charges. Mesoionic carbenes are {{also referred to as}} abnormal N-heterocyclic carbenes (aNHC) or remote N-heterocyclic carbenes (rNHC). A variety of free carbenes can be isolated and are stable at room temperature. Other free carbenes are not stable and are susceptible to intermolecular decomposition pathways. MICs do not dimerize according to Wanzlick equilibrium as do normal NHCs. This results in relaxed steric requirements for mesoionic carbenes as compared to NHCs. [...] There are several mesoionic carbenes that cannot be generated as free compounds, but can be synthesized as a ligand in a transition metal complex. Most MIC transition metal complexes are less sensitive to air and moisture than phosphine or normal NHC complexes. They are also resistant to oxidation. The robust nature of MIC complexes is due to the ligand’s strong σ-donating ability. They are stronger σ-donors than phosphines, as well as normal N-heterocyclic carbenes due to decreased heteroatom stabilization. The strength of carbene ligands is attributed to the electropositive carbon center that forms strong bonds of a covalent nature with the metal. [...] They have been shown to lower the frequency of CO <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations</b> in metal complexes and exhibit large trans effects.|$|E
30|$|The FT-IR {{spectra of}} Sgc 8, FSNPs, and Sgc 8 -FSNPs {{are shown in}} Fig.  2 c.

The peak at 1554  cm− 1 was observed at the spectrum for Sgc 8 -FSNPs, so it likely reflects the attachment of the amine-labeled aptamer Sgc 8 {{to the surface of}} FSNPs-COOH.|$|E
30|$|FT-IR {{spectra of}} {{calcined}} samples {{are shown in}} Fig.  2 b. Samples calcined at 100 and 200  °C show broad absorption bands of the asymmetric and symmetric <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations</b> of OHO, placed at 3080 – 3700  cm− 1. The IR absorption peaks at 2900  cm− 1 are assigned to C–H <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations.</b> The bands at 1650 – 1540  cm− 1 and 1447 – 1340  cm− 1 correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations</b> of the bound carboxylic groups (COO−).

After the reaction is conducted for 48 h (red line), the intensities of the FTIR peaks corresponding to the C-O (epoxide groups) <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> peak at 1, 220 cm- 1 disappeared nearly, the C=O <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> peak at 1, 730 cm- 1 decreased dramatically, and the vibration and deformation peaks of O-H groups at 3, 428 and 1, 415 cm- 1, respectively, and the C-O (alkoxy groups) stretching peak at 1, 052 cm- 1 increased slightly. These results further confirmed that some active functionalities (epoxide groups) in GO have been removed.|$|R
40|$|Dissimilar {{dynamics}} of coupled <b>stretch</b> <b>vibrations</b> {{of a water}} molecule are revealed by two-dimensional IR correlation spectroscopy.

The bands at 3, 400 to 3, 500  cm- 1 were due to -OH stretching on silanol. The peaks at 2, 930  cm- 1 were attributed to the <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> of C-H in aromatic and C-H in alkyl [22]. The peaks at 1, 400 to 1, 550  cm- 1 {{were assigned to the}} <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> of C-C in an aromatic ring. The presence of additional absorption bands at 800, 950, and 1, 110  cm- 1 were most likely due to the symmetric and asymmetric <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> of framework and terminal Si-O groups.
