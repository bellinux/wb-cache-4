Our first result is a characterization of some measures of location as L-functionals, and was inspired by de Finetti's representation theorem for quasi-linear means. The main result of the paper is a representation theorem for some spread measures as integrals {{with respect to the}} measure defined by the quantile function.

As a result order flow is a highly persistent long-memory process.
