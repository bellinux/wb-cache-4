25|$|The {{problems}} of making metal-coated, glass mirrors {{was due to}} the difficulties in making glass that was very clear, as most ancient glass was tinted green with iron. This was overcome when people began mixing soda, limestone, potash, manganese, and fern ashes with the glass. There was also no way for the ancients to make flat panes of glass with uniform thicknesses. The earliest methods for producing glass panes began in France, when people began blowing glass bubbles, and then spinning them rapidly to flatten them out into plates from which pieces could be cut. However, these pieces were still not uniform in thickness, so produced distorted images as well. A better method was to blow a cylinder of glass, cut off the ends, <b>slice</b> <b>it</b> down the center, and unroll it onto a flat hearth. This method produced the first mirror-quality glass panes, but it was very difficult and resulted in a lot of breakage. Even windows were primarily made of oiled paper or stained glass, until the mid-nineteenth century, due to the high cost of making clear, flat panes of glass.|$|E

He praised the idea of connecting The Next Generation to The Original Series early in the series, but also remarked that [...] "however you <b>slice</b> <b>it</b> up, this episode is pretty awful."

500|$|She {{initially}} travelled to India to meet A. R. Rahman, {{but found}} it hard to communicate her ideas to him and the planned musical collaboration did not take place. Rahman did, however, provide M.I.A. with a number of contacts and allow her to use his studio, where 22 members of drumming group The Tapes were recorded for Kala. Producer Switch, who had initially travelled to India purely to engineer the planned sessions, ultimately became involved in the composition of several tracks for the album. A visit to Angola to work with DJ Znobia was cancelled after Znobia was involved in a car accident, but M.I.A. was able to record in Trinidad, Liberia, Jamaica and Australia. She and Switch relied heavily on Logic Pro, a digital audio workstation produced by Apple, and were able to capture vocals and background sounds outside the traditional studio environment, using a microphone and a Macbook Pro. The album features guest vocals from Afrikan Boy, The Wilcannia Mob, and Timbaland, and further collaborations with Switch, Blaqstarr, Morganics and Diplo. She likened the process of recording the album to [...] "making a big old marble cake with lots of different countries and influences. Then you <b>slice</b> <b>it</b> up and call each slice a song".|$|E
500|$|Leonard Maltin {{awarded the}} film {{two and a}} half stars out of four, {{describing}} it a [...] "weird, almost incoherent crime story." [...] Celluloid Dream's Simon Hill commented that the writing was a disappointment, musing that it did however feature [...] "glimpses of director Raimi would become". A scene in a dentist office reminded him of a scene from Spider-Man 2, a film also directed by Raimi. He commented that [...] "even in his small part Campbell is the most memorable character in the film", also praising the performance of the two exterminators. Campbell also criticized the film, describing it as a [...] "lesson about abject failure", writing [...] "no matter how you <b>slice</b> <b>it,</b> the film was a dog, and everyone involved can pretty much line up and take forty whacks. As filmmakers, we failed to execute a misguided concept and our studio refused us the benefit of any doubt." [...] The film has achieved the status of a minor cult film. In one of the few positive notices, MTV writer Adam Rosenberg described the film as [...] "criminally underrated". Rosenberg disagreed with the consensus about the film, labeling it as a [...] "hard-to-find classic". Kim Newman also called the film underrated, writing that the film [...] "revels" [...] in its slapstick nature, taking influence from everything from horror comics to The Three Stooges.|$|E

60|$|If, however, our coco-nut {{is lucky}} enough to escape the robber-crabs, the pigs, and the monkeys, {{as well as to}} avoid falling into the hands of man, and being {{converted}} into the copra of commerce, or sold from a costermonger's barrow in the chilly streets of ungenial London at a penny a <b>slice,</b> <b>it</b> may very probably succeed in germinating after the fashion I have already described, and pushing up its head through the surrounding foliage to the sunlight above. As a rule, the coco-nut has been dropped by its mother tree on the sandy soil of a sea-beach; and this is the spot it best loves, and where it grows to the stateliest height. Sometimes, however, it falls into the sea itself, and then the loose husk buoys it up, so that it floats away bravely till it is cast by the waves upon some distant coral reef or desert island. It is this power of floating and surviving a long voyage that has dispersed the coco-nut so widely among oceanic islands, where so few plants are generally to be found. Indeed, on many atolls or isolated reefs (for example, on Keeling Island) it is the only tree or shrub that grows in any quantity, and on it the pigs, the poultry, the ducks, and the land crabs of the place entirely subsist. In any case, wherever it happens to strike, the young coco-nut sends up at first a fine rosette of big spreading leaves, not raised as afterwards on a tall stem, but springing direct from the ground in a wide circle, something like a very big and graceful fern. In this early stage nothing can be more beautiful or more essentially tropical in appearance than a plantation of young coco-nuts. Their long feathery leaves spreading out in great clumps from the buried stock, and waving with lithe motion before the strong sea-breeze of the Indies, are the very embodiment of those deceptive ideal tropics which, alas, {{are to be found in}} actual reality nowhere on earth save in the artificial palm-houses at Kew, and the Casino Gardens at too entrancing Monte Carlo.|$|E
