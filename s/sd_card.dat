5|$|The Virtual Console service allows Wii {{owners to}} play games {{originally}} released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo 64, Sega's Genesis/Mega Drive and Sega Mark III/Sega Master System, NEC's TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine, SNK's Neo Geo console, Commodore 64 and arcade games. Virtual Console games are distributed over broadband Internet via the Wii Shop Channel, and are saved to the Wii internal flash memory or to a removable <b>SD</b> <b>card.</b> Once downloaded, Virtual Console games can be accessed from the Wii Menu (as individual channels) or from an <b>SD</b> <b>card</b> via the <b>SD</b> <b>Card</b> Menu. There is also a Wii homebrew community, dedicated to creating and playing content unendorsed by Nintendo.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{copied the}} files from her laptop to an <b>SD</b> <b>card</b> for her camera, {{so that she}} could take it with her to the United States while on R leave. Army {{investigators}} later found the <b>SD</b> <b>card</b> in Manning's basement room in her aunt's home, in Potomac, Maryland. On January 23, Manning flew to the United States via Germany, for two weeks of leave. It was during this visit that she first went out dressed as a woman, wearing a wig and makeup. After her arrest, her former partner, Tyler Watkins, told Wired that Manning had said during the visit that she had found some sensitive information and was considering leaking it.|$|E

50|$|Red cards affect attack. They {{can only}} be used in combat. Values on red cards range from +3 to +9, as well as C, and <b>S.</b> The C <b>Card</b> gives an attack bonus equal {{to the amount of}} the opponent's attack stat.

5|$|After {{the release}} of Metroid: Other M, it was {{reported}} to have a bug where the door in Sector 3 is permanently locked and impassable, preventing players from continuing. Nintendo revealed that a bug is triggered when the player backtracks to the room within Sector 3 where they have previously obtained the Ice Beam. The company has set up a program that allows players affected by the bug to send in an <b>SD</b> <b>card</b> or their Wii console with their save files to be repaired.|$|E
40|$|In {{the era of}} Information Technology, {{openness}} of the information is a major concern. As the confidentiality and integrity of the information is critically important, {{it has to be}} secured from unauthorized access. Security refers to prohibit some unauthorized persons from some important data or from some precious assets. So we need accurateness on automatic personal identification in various applications such as ATM, driving license, passports, citizen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>card,</b> cellular telephones, voter 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> ID <b>card</b> etc. Unimodal system carries some problems such as Noise in sensed data, Intra-class variations, Inter-class similarities, Non-universality and Spoof attacks. The accuracy of system is improved by combining different biometric traits which are called multimodal. This system gives more accuracy as {{it would be difficult for}} imposter to spoof multiple biometric traits simultaneously. This paper reviews different methods for fusion of biometric traits...|$|R

Unlike the international version, the Chinese models feature a removable back cover, exposing a microSD slot for storage expansion and dual SIM card slots. Complementing this feature, {{a special edition}} with a Wang Leehom-autographed back cover was also released. HTC stated that {{it was able to}} include an <b>SD</b> <b>card</b> slot in the Chinese model because its radio hardware did not take up as much internal space as that of the international models.|$|E
5|$|USB {{implements}} {{connections to}} storage devices using {{a set of}} standards called the USB mass storage device class (MSC or UMS). This was at first intended for traditional magnetic and optical drives and has been extended to support flash drives.

The process of making a novel device look like a familiar device is also known as extension. The ability to boot a write-locked <b>SD</b> <b>card</b> with a USB adapter is particularly advantageous for maintaining the integrity and non-corruptible, pristine state of the booting medium.|$|E

5|$|During the Article 32 hearing, the prosecution, led by Captain Ashden Fein, {{presented}} 300,000 {{pages of}} documents in evidence, including chat logs and classified material. The court heard from two Army investigators, Special Agent David Shaver, head of the digital forensics and research branch of the Army's Computer Crime Investigative Unit (CCIU); and Mark Johnson, a digital forensics contractor from ManTech International, {{who works for the}} CCIU. They testified that they had found 100,000 State Department cables on a workplace computer Manning had used between November 2009 and May 2010; 400,000 military reports from Iraq and 91,000 from Afghanistan on an <b>SD</b> <b>card</b> found in her basement room in her aunt's home in Potomac, Maryland; and 10,000 cables on her personal MacBook Pro and storage devices that they said had not been passed to WikiLeaks because a file was corrupted. They also recovered 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on Manning's MacBook hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Julian Assange. Two of the chat handles, which used the Berlin Chaos Computer Club's domain (ccc.de), were associated with the names Julian Assange and Nathaniel Frank.|$|E
5|$|To {{reduce the}} storage {{footprint}} {{of the operating}} system, Windows 10 automatically compresses system files. The system can reduce the storage footprint of Windows by approximately 1.5GB for 32-bit systems and 2.6GB for 64-bit systems. The level of compression used is dependent on a performance assessment performed during installations or by OEMs, which tests how much compression can be used without harming operating system performance. Furthermore, the Refresh and Reset functions use runtime system files instead, making a separate recovery partition redundant, allowing patches and updates to remain installed following the operation, and further {{reducing the amount of}} space required for Windows 10 by up to 12GB. These functions replace the WIMBoot mode introduced on Windows 8.1 Update, which allowed OEMs to configure low-capacity devices with flash-based storage to use Windows system files out of the compressed WIM image typically used for installation and recovery. Windows 10 also includes a function in its Settings app that allows users to view a breakdown of how their device's storage capacity is being used by different types of files, and determine whether certain types of files are saved to internal storage or an <b>SD</b> <b>card</b> by default.|$|E
