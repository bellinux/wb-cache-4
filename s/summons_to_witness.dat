60|$|To the {{sensitive}} seaman that summons {{sounds like a}} doom. He knows that the same law which impels it--the same law by which the culprits of the day must suffer; that by that very law he also is liable at any time to be judged and condemned. And the inevitableness of his own presence at the scene; the strong arm that drags him {{in view of the}} scourge, and holds him there till all is over; forcing upon his loathing eye and soul the sufferings and groans of men who have familiarly consorted with him, eaten with him, battled out watches with him--men of his own type and badge--all this conveys a terrible hint of the omnipotent authority under which he lives. Indeed, to such a man the naval <b>summons</b> <b>to</b> <b>witness</b> punishment carries a thrill, somewhat akin to what we may impute to the quick and the dead, when they shall hear the Last Trump, that is to bid them all arise in their ranks, and behold the final penalties inflicted upon the sinners of our race.|$|E
50|$|Conduct {{money is}} money paid in some legal systems {{to a person}} under the {{compulsion}} of a <b>summons</b> <b>to</b> <b>witness</b> (subpoena) {{to pay for their}} expenses to attend in court. It generally incorporates a daily rate for each day the witness must attend in court (with a one-day minimum), plus a travel allowance to allow the witness to get to the place of the hearing. Generally, conduct money must be delivered with the summons for it to have legal effect. In some jurisdictions, however, failure to provide conduct money at the time the summons is served is only an irregularity but not fatal to the validity of the summons. Witnesses are generally entitled to additional conduct money if their attendance is required on more days than anticipated. Moreover, witnesses who are required to make an overnight stay to attend in court on more than one day are generally entitled to an allowance for accommodation and meals.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that the English witenagemot had {{its origins in}} ancient Germanic assemblies <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>witness</b> royal grants of land. Yet whatever their status in the 5th and 4th centuries, {{the nature of these}} assemblies in England was irrevocably changed when Christianity was introduced, circa 600. Hereafter, church and state were [...] "inseparably intertwined," [...] and this was reflected in the strong ecclesiastical element in the witan's membership and concerns; records of decisions made by witan encompass ecclesiastical and secular jurisdictions alike.|$|R
50|$|An old Seneca slave was <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>witness</b> the {{execution}} of his countryman, and afterwards Kondiaronk ordered the man {{to travel to the}} Iroquois and report how badly the French had treated the captive. Since the captive was intended for adoption into the Michilimackinac village, the way his death was portrayed to the Iroquois angered them because they felt the French disrespected their tradition. Due to Kondiaronk’s skillful manipulation of events, the peace negotiations between the French and Iroquois came to a halt— a satisfactory result for the Hurons.|$|R
50|$|The two {{officers}} are <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>witness</b> Ms. Austin's autopsy; trace evidence strongly suggests a Japanese killer. Afterwards, Smith and Connor are approached by Ishiguro, who now presents them with seemingly authentic videos from the security cameras, which show Sakamura {{to be the}} murderer. Having solved the mystery, Connor returns home to rest, while Smith and Graham go to apprehend Sakamura. Upon arriving at Eddie's house, the two detectives are stalled by two naked women while Eddie escapes in a Ferrari. After a high-speed chase, Eddie's car crashes and bursts into flames, killing him.|$|R

2500|$|In late July 2002, Clonaid's {{branch in}} South Korea, BioFusion Tech, said a woman became {{pregnant}} {{with a human}} clone. However, in the week of 27 September 2002, South Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare {{announced that it would}} ban human cloning and sentence violators to a 10-year prison term. Branch spokesman Kwak Gi-Hwa said that the surrogate mother, unmarried at 26 years old, moved out of South Korea into another country. The spokesman said he had no knowledge of which country that was and that only a few people in Clonaid knew. [...] He described himself as simply a volunteer for the branch which had closed under government pressure following their claim. [...] He accused the government of Korea of considering Christian opinions of human cloning over those of scientists who criticized the proposed human cloning ban. [...] He was later <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>witness</b> in front of the Korean Parliament.|$|R
6000|$|At {{five o'clock}} {{precisely}} we were <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>witness</b> the launch. Champaigne and claret had brought Marble into good humour, nor was I at {{all out of}} spirits, myself. Emily put on her hat, and took her parasol, just as she would have done at home, and accepting my arm, {{she walked to the}} ship-yard, like all the rest of us. Getting her a good place for the sight, I accompanied Marble {{to take a look at}} the [...] "Pretty Poll," [...] which had not as yet attracted as much of our attention as she ought. I had suggested to him the probability of an occasion offering to rise upon the Frenchman, while their attention was taken up with the schooner; but Monsieur Le Compte warily kept quite half his men in the ship, and this put the attempt out of the question, since the guns of the Crisis would have swept any part of the island.|$|R

5000|$|November 29 - A young Chechen woman, Elza Gazuyeva, {{carried out}} an {{assassination}} attempt on the Urus-Martan military district commandant, identified only as General Geydar Gadzhiev, blowing herself up with a hand grenade near a group of Russian soldiers. Gazuyeva had lost a husband, two brothers, and a cousin in the war. Gadzhiev, {{who was accused of}} atrocities against civilians by locals, reportedly had personally <b>summoned</b> Elza <b>to</b> <b>witness</b> her husband's and brother's torture and execution.

25|$|The {{subpoena}} duces tecum {{is similar}} to the subpoena ad testificandum, which is a writ <b>summoning</b> a <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> testify orally.

60|$|It {{was soon}} {{known that the}} magistrates would sit at Mr. Brook's at one o'clock, and a {{policeman}} went round the village {{with a list of}} names given him by Mr. Dodgson, <b>to</b> <b>summon</b> <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> attend. Jack Simpson had strongly urged that his name might not be included, in the first place because above all things he hated being put forward, and in the second, as he pointed out to the schoolmaster, it might excite a feeling against him, and hinder his power for good, if he, the leader of the young men, was to appear as a witness against the elders, especially as among the prisoners was Tom Walker, with whom he had fought. As Jack could give no more testimony than his companions, and as generally it was considered an important and responsible privilege <b>to</b> appear as <b>witness,</b> Mr. Dodgson omitted Jack's name from the list.|$|R

60|$|Down {{below in}} the October {{sunlight}} were my sheds {{and the little}} group that had been <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> <b>witness</b> the start, their faces craned upward {{and most of them}} scrutinising my expression through field-glasses. I could see Carnaby and Beatrice on horseback, and two girls I did not know with them; Cothope and three or four workmen I employed; my aunt and Mrs. Levinstein, who was staying with her, on foot, and Dimmock, the veterinary surgeon, and one or two others. My shadow moved a little to the north of them like the shadow of a fish. At Lady Grove the servants were out on the lawn, and the Duffield school playground swarmed with children too indifferent to aeronautics to cease their playing. But in the Crest Hill direction--the place looked extraordinarily squat and ugly from above--there were knots and strings of staring workmen everywhere--not one of them working, but all agape. (But now I write it, {{it occurs to me that}} perhaps it was their dinner hour; it was certainly near twelve.) I hung for a moment or so enjoying the soar, then turned about to face a clear stretch of open down, let the engine out to full speed and set my rollers at work rolling in the net, and so tightening the gas-bags. Instantly the pace quickened with the diminished resistance...|$|R
5000|$|In April 1805, a {{majority}} {{of the members of the}} court judged her guilt [...] "more than half proven". However, Fock refused to confess and maintained her version. A law at the time allowed for an accused person who could not be judged guilty but was regarded as dangerous for society to be kept prisoner awaiting their confession. This law was used for Metta Fock. She protested to the monarch and was granted reprieve and allowed <b>to</b> <b>summon</b> more <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> her defense; however, the sentence was confirmed in November 1805. In 1806, she was placed as a prisoner at Carlsten awaiting her confession. She was the only female prisoner ever to be kept at Carlsten, which normally only housed male prisoners. She was kept in an isolation cell, and tended only by two priests, who were to encourage her to confess the truth.|$|R
