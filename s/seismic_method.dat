50|$|Seismic {{reflection}} exploration {{grew out}} of the seismic refraction exploration method, which was used to find oil associated with salt domes. Ludger Mintrop, a German mine surveyor, devised a mechanical seismograph in 1914 that he successfully used to detect salt domes in Germany. He applied for a German patent in 1919 that was issued in 1926. In 1921 he founded the company Seismos, which was hired to conduct seismic exploration in Texas and Mexico, resulting in the first commercial discovery of oil using the refraction <b>seismic</b> <b>method</b> in 1924. The 1924 discovery of the Orchard salt dome in Texas led to a boom in seismic refraction exploration along the Gulf Coast, but by 1930 the method had led to the discovery most of the shallow Gulf Coast salt domes, and the refraction <b>seismic</b> <b>method</b> faded.|$|E

We review important contributions that have been made in developing these techniques for the mining industry with focus on four main regions: Australia, Europe, Canada, and South Africa. A wide range of case studies are covered, including some that are published in the special issue accompanying this article, from surface to borehole <b>seismic</b> <b>methods,</b> as well as petrophysical data and seismic modeling of mineral deposits.

Separate section is the special blasting which must ensure strict, advance superiors conditions. Success in performed blasting depends on the applied method, the rocky massif and quantity of explosives. To determine the method for blasting and the quantity of explosive in the blast holes, it is necessary to know the mechanical properties of the ground: direction of foliation, degree of cracking, Jung modulus of elasticity and other parameters which are used for mathematical modeling to define the position of the blast holes and the optimal quantity of explosive in them.

40|$|Shear wave {{velocity}} (Vs) information of a soil site {{is one of}} the critical parameters in soil dynamics and earthquake engineering. Although it can be obtained from a shear-wave seismic survey either at the surface or through a borehole method, the surface-wave method is an excellent alternative. It utilizes the dispersion of Rayleigh waves that usually take more than two thirds of total seismic energy generated by an impact seismic source at the surface. This indicates a relative easiness in the field survey and sometimes also during the post-acquisition processing steps. Although because of this reason the method appears highly attractive, complications, however, may arise as with all other types of <b>seismic</b> <b>method.</b> Source-generated body waves (e. g., direct and refracted compressional waves), higher modes of Rayleigh waves, random ambient noise (e. g., cultural noise), and coherent arrivals scattered from surface objects (e. g., from building foundations) all interfere with the signal, the planar fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves propagating directly from source. A multichannel <b>seismic</b> <b>method</b> similar to the one long used in the oil industry provides a highly effective quality control during both acquisition and processing stages. In addition, a 2 -D pattern-recognition processing technique has an extraordinary capability to differentiate signal from noise even under a severe noise contamination. This <b>seismic</b> <b>method</b> is applied to various soil-site projects to produce 1 -D and 2 -D Vs maps.

40|$|Geological, topographic, and seismic {{methods were}} used to locate faults in the {{vicinity}} of Clearlake in northern California. The geological method, which seeks faults as discontinuities in the lithotope, found faults in the Tertiary-Cretaceous rocks east of Burns Valley. The topographic method, which is used to produce Fault Evaluation Reports, found a very active fault zone, the Konocti Bay fault zone, south of Highlands arm. It also found some active faults north of Highlands arm, {{in the eastern part of}} Burns Valley and on the lakeshore near Oak Park. The <b>seismic</b> <b>method</b> is the most enduring of the three methods but is limited by location accuracy; the results improve as monitoring continues because of increases in the density of events and improvements in the crustal velocity model.
