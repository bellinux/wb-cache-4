5|$|In the 1480s, Leonardo {{received}} two very important commissions and commenced another {{work that was}} of ground-breaking importance in terms of composition. Two of the three were never finished, and the third took <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>that</b> it was subject to lengthy negotiations over completion and payment.|$|E
5|$|Natural calcium is {{a mixture}} of five stable {{isotopes}} (40Ca, 42Ca, 43Ca, 44Ca, and 46Ca) and one isotope with a half-life <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>that</b> it can be considered stable for all practical purposes (48Ca, with a half-life of about 4.3×1019years). Calcium is the first (lightest) element to have six naturally occurring isotopes.|$|E
5|$|The comic and science-fiction {{bookshop}} Forbidden Planet {{was established}} at No. 23 in 1978 {{before moving to}} New Oxford Street and becoming an international chain. When Douglas Adams attempted to attend a signing for the first The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy book in October 1979, the queue to the shop was <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>that</b> Adams thought a demonstration was taking place elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|The {{rules of}} the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature are that in general the first-published {{description}} has priority; therefore, the valid scientific name for the oceanic whitetip shark should be Carcharhinus maou. However, Lesson's name remained forgotten for <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>that</b> Carcharhinus longimanus remains widely accepted.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} stage, the Tour {{returned}} to France; at the border, the riders were stopped by two French customs {{officers and the}} delay took <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>that</b> the stage had to be restarted. During the stage in the Alps, Émile Georget was better than his competitors; he won the stage and became leader of the general classification. Georget won five of the first eight stages, and had a commanding lead. In the seventh stage, Marcel Cadolle, {{at that time in}} second place, fell and his handlebar penetrated his knee, after which he had to give up.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} tungsten {{consists of}} five isotopes whose half-lives are <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>that</b> {{they can be}} considered stable. Theoretically, all five can decay into isotopes of element 72 (hafnium) by alpha emission, but only 180W has been observed to do so with a half-life of (1.8 ± 0.2)×1018 years; on average, this yields about two alpha decays of 180W in one gram of natural tungsten per year. The other naturally occurring isotopes have not been observed to decay, constraining their half-lives {{to be at least}} 4×1021 years.|$|E

5|$|When the Swedish invaded Zealand in August 1658, the Dutch Republic was not {{the only}} foreign power that took notice. A union between Brandenburg, Poland and Austria had already started to put {{together}} a relief army in December 1657, but preparations of the polyglot force took <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>that</b> the Treaty of Roskilde was signed before the army was ready to march. However, the preparations were not in vain—with the 1658 invasion the allies were in an excellent position to quickly put together a force and march towards Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Failure usually meant {{six more}} months of sea service before the {{examination}} could again be attempted. Some men never passed it. Successful completion made the midshipman a 'passed midshipman'. From the 18th century {{until the second}} half of the 19th century, a midshipman in the Royal Navy who passed the lieutenant's examination did not automatically receive a commission. Midshipmen with political connections were promoted first, while others would wait their turn on a roster. During wartime, when large numbers of ships and men might be lost in battle, most passed midshipman would be promoted in a year or two, but during peacetime the wait might be <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>that</b> the midshipman would eventually be considered too old and lose his chance for a commission.|$|E
5|$|Filmmaker Terrence Malick {{originally}} {{worked on}} a screenplay limited to Guevara's attempts to start a revolution in Bolivia. When financing fell through, Malick left the project, and Soderbergh subsequently agreed to direct the film. He {{realized that there was}} no context for Guevara's actions in Bolivia and decided that his participation in the Cuban Revolution and his appearance at the United Nations in 1964 should also be depicted. Peter Buchman was hired to write the screenplay: the script was <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>that</b> Soderbergh decided to divide the film into two parts, one chronicling Cuba and other depicting Bolivia. Soderbergh shot the installments back-to-back starting at the beginning of July 2007, with Guerrilla first in Spain for 39 days, and The Argentine shot in Puerto Rico and Mexico for 39 days.|$|E

5|$|Ford reappears in the {{official}} novel continuation Stargate Atlantis Legacy: The Third Path. To their surprise, the team finds Ford alive and {{with a group of}} nomadic humans known as the Travelers. He explains to Sheppard he managed to escape the hive ship before it was destroyed, but crashed on the planet over which the battle took place. With the help of the Travelers, he recovered from his addiction but it took <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>that</b> he could no longer find Atlantis afterwards. Ford began leading a guerilla campaign against the Wraith, aided by the Travelers. He also now has a wife and son and regrets his previous actions under the Wraith enzyme. At the end of the novel, Ford is safely returned to Earth with his wife and son and reunites with his cousin and grandparents.|$|E
5|$|On February 7, 2006, a {{settlement}} was reached {{in which the}} trophy could be awarded to non-NHL teams should the league not operate for a season. The dispute lasted <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>that,</b> {{by the time it}} was settled, the NHL had resumed operating for the 2005–06 season, and the Stanley Cup went unclaimed for the 2004–05 season. Furthermore, when another NHL lockout commenced in 2012 the Trustees stated that the 2006 agreement did not oblige them to award the Cup in the event of a lost season, and that they were likely to reject any non-NHL challenges for the Cup in the event the 2012–13 season were cancelled, which it was not.|$|E
5|$|The {{result was}} {{increased}} water flow in Kitchen Creek, {{which has been}} cutting the falls in the glens since. The gradient or slope of Kitchen Creek was fairly stable for its flow when it had a much smaller drainage basin, as Phillips Creek still does. The increased basin size means that Kitchen Creek in the glens is too steep for its present amount of water flow. As Kitchen Creek continues to cut into the rock and erode it up the Allegheny Front, the creek's slope will decrease and become less steep. In the future, the creek's flow and slope are predicted to become {{similar to those of}} other nearby creeks with similar size drainage basins. This process could take <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>that</b> a new glacial period might occur before the transformation is complete.|$|E

5|$|Written by William Emms. Planned as {{the fourth}} serial of Series 4, The Imps was a four-part story {{concerned}} about a spaceship overrun by Imp-like aliens and aggressive alien vegetation. The script was commissioned on 17 October 1966, and soon had to be rewritten to accommodate new companion Jamie. However, due to sickness {{on the part of}} Emms, this took <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>that</b> further rewrites were needed to explain the loss of Ben and Polly and on 4 January 1967 the story was dropped. Emms reused elements of the story in Mission to Venus, a Choose Your Own Adventure-style story featuring the Sixth Doctor.|$|E
5|$|By August 9, the {{production}} {{was already a}} full day behind schedule. Despite the delays, Wise refused to shoot more than twelve hours on set, feeling he lost his edge afterwards. The director was patient on set; bets were placed on when he would finally lose his temper, but pool organizers returned the money when Wise never lost his cool. Given his unfamiliarity with the source material Wise relied on the actors, especially Shatner, to help ensure that dialog and characterizations {{were consistent with the}} show. While the bridge scenes were shot early, trouble with filming the transporter room scene delayed further work. Crew working on the transporter platform found their footwear melting on the lighted grid while shooting tests. Issues with the wormhole sequences caused further delays. The footage for the scene was filmed two ways; first, at the standard 24frames per second, and then at the faster 48frames; the normal footage was a back-up if the slow-motion effect produced by the faster frame speed did not turned out as planned. The shoot dragged on <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>that</b> it became a running joke for cast members to try and top each other with wormhole-related puns. The scene was finally completed on August 24, while the transporter scenes were being filmed at the same time on the same soundstage.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{explained}} such male-female {{differences in}} {{his theory of}} sexual selection in his book The Descent of Man. Once the females begin to select males according to any particular characteristic, such as a long tail or a coloured crest, that characteristic is emphasized {{more and more in}} the males. Eventually all the males will have the characteristics that the females are sexually selecting for, as only those males can reproduce. This mechanism is powerful enough to create features that are strongly disadvantageous to the males in other ways. For example, some male birds of paradise have wing or tail streamers that are <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>that</b> they impede flight, while their brilliant colours may make the males more vulnerable to predators. In the extreme, sexual selection may drive species to extinction, as has been argued for the enormous horns of the male Irish elk, which may have made it difficult for mature males to move and feed.|$|E
