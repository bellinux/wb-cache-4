5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no {{qualifying}} games, {{the opening}} two matches {{of the tournament}} were the first World Cup games ever played, taking place simultaneously on 13 July 1930; France beat Mexico 4–1 at the Estadio Pocitos, while the United States defeated Belgium 3–0 {{at the same time}} at the Estadio Gran Parque Central. France's Lucien Laurent was the scorer of the first World Cup goal.|$|E
5|$|Swanberg {{found the}} process of editing Digging for Fire more {{difficult}} than for his previous films, <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> many different possibilities of how to integrate the separate storylines involving Tim and Lee. He dedicated the film to Paul Mazursky, who died in 2014, because of the influence Mazursky had on Swanberg's work {{and because of the}} thematic similarities between Mazursky's work (particularly the 1969 film Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice) and Digging for Fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{responsibility}} of the recovery {{was transferred to the}} Governor of Svalbard on 30 August, <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no survivors. In addition, police personnel from the mainland were transferred to Svalbard to work with the investigation and recovery. The work was supplemented by local volunteers. Because of the bad weather, which included fog and snow, it was often impossible to transport workers to the plateau, and work therefore started in the valley.|$|E

5|$|The son Richard Johnson did {{not begin}} his formal {{education}} until age fifteen, <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no schools on the frontier. He entered Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. While studying law (reading the law) as a legal apprentice with George Nicholas and James Brown by 1799 at the university, where {{his father was a}} trustee, he quickly drawn into politics like his father.|$|E
5|$|After {{releasing}} the British steamer, Emden turned south to Simalur, {{where she met}} the captured collier Buresk. Müller then decided to attack the British coaling station in the Cocos Islands; he intended to destroy the wireless station there and draw away British forces searching {{for him in the}} Indian Ocean. While en route to the Cocos, Emden spent two days combing the Sunda Strait for merchant shipping without success. She thereafter proceeded to the Cocos, arriving off Direction Island at 06:00 on the morning of 9 November. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no British vessels in the area, Müller sent ashore a landing party led by Kapitänleutnant (First Lieutenant) Hellmuth von Mücke, Emdens executive officer. The party consisted of another two officers, six non-commissioned officers, and thirty-eight sailors.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1780s, a {{large number}} of {{prominent}} Americans called {{for the establishment of a}} central mint to supply the United States with official coinage; all such proposals failed due in large part to lack of funds and opposition from individuals and groups who preferred that coins be struck by the individual states. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no federal coins issued, the needs of the states were fulfilled by a variety of domestic and foreign coins and tokens, including Spanish eight-real coins (popularly known as Spanish dollars or pieces of eight).|$|E

5|$|Groves did {{not intend}} the Smyth Report {{to be the last}} word on the project. It formed an {{addendum}} to the Manhattan District History, the official history of the project. This eventually consisted of 35 volumes with 39 appendices or supplements. It was written in the immediate postwar years by the chemists, metallurgists, physicists, and administrators who had worked on the project. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no security restrictions, it covered every aspect of the Manhattan Project, but was itself classified. Most of it was declassified in the 1960s and 1970s and became available to scholars, except for some technical details on the construction of the bombs.|$|E
5|$|In the 2013/14 season, Prevc {{recorded}} his first individual World Cup win in Kulm. With a second {{place at the}} same venue, Prevc won the season's ski flying title <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> only two scheduled ski flying events in the season. He went on to win in Sapporo which brought him {{to the top of the}} World Cup overall standings for the first time in his career, where he remained for the next couple of events. At the end of the season, he finished 2nd in the overall rankings, after Kamil Stoch of Poland. Prevc also won the last world cup event of the season in Planica, accumulating three wins and eleven podiums in total which was his most successful season until then.|$|E
5|$|Older storms have {{incomplete}} pressure readings, <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no satellite-based estimates; {{the only}} observations {{were taken by}} ships, land-based observations, or reconnaissance aircraft when available. Ava's minimum known pressure was measured {{when it was a}} Category4 hurricane, for example. John and Gilma have incomplete pressures because the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, in general, did not publish pressure on systems in the central Pacific (140°W to the dateline) at the time. However, {{it should be noted that}} this list is not identical to the list of most intense Pacific hurricanes. The most intense known Category4 storm in the eastern Pacific was 2014's Odile. The lowest pressure of this storm was 918 millibars, lower than that of some Category 5's, such as Guillermo.|$|E

5|$|Pritchard {{received}} word from local residents {{that on the}} night before a party, probably including the Confederate President, had crossed the Ocmulgee River just north of Abbeville. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> two roads to Irwindale, one of which had been taken by Harnden and his men, Pritchard decided to take the other, {{to see if he could}} capture Davis. He took with him about a hundred and forty men and their horses, while the balance of the Michiganders stayed on the Ocmulgee River near Abbeville. Some seven hours later, at 1 A.M. on May 10, Pritchard arrived at Irwindale. There was no evidence of Harnden's men being there yet.|$|E
5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no playoff {{system in}} the APFA until 1932, a meeting was held to {{determine}} the 1920 APFA Champions. Each team that showed up had a vote to determine the champions. The All-Americans stated that they should win the award because they had more wins and were not beaten by the Akron Pros. Since the Akron Pros had a 1.000 winning percentage, however, the Pros were awarded the Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup on April 30, 1921. Ties were not counted in standings until 1972, which is why Akron is credited with a 1.000 winning percentage. The sportswriter Bruce Copeland compiled the All-Pro list for the 1920 season. No player from the All-Americans were on the list.|$|E
5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> only 40 trained {{drivers in}} the Logorište barracks, Boro Ercegovac ordered {{soldiers}} who had never operated military vehicles to drive in a column starting from the barracks under fire at 3:30p.m. As the column advanced south towards Malići, elements of the 110th Infantry Brigade retreated {{from the village of}} Zastinja (on the right bank of the Korana River). The evacuating JNA column sustained casualties, although it was supported by the 9th Motorised Brigade and two detachments of the SAO Krajina TO from Vojnić. The SAO Krajina TO were later accused of killing civilians in the area.|$|E

5|$|There are {{no known}} {{contemporary}} documents describing the design or methods of {{construction of the}} canal and nothing about its opening. However, a report from 1632 on alterations to the river noted that 600 men {{were involved in the}} work, so presumably there was sufficient labour locally for such tasks. Wigmore probably used handbills at local inns to recruit his workers, <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no newspapers to carry advertisements. The work would have been done using pickaxes, shovels and wheelbarrows. The excavated ditch was then lined with blue clay to make it watertight. Excavations for a sewer in 1974 and work on a rubbish tip in 1979 revealed the layers of blue clay, and there were clay pits near Stamford, which supported a pottery industry, although their precise location is unknown.|$|E
5|$|These {{findings}} were contested {{a few years}} later by Catherine Forster, who reanalyzed Triceratops material more comprehensively and concluded that the remains fell into two species, T. horridus and T. prorsus, although the distinctive skull of T. ("Nedoceratops") hatcheri differed enough to warrant a separate genus. She found that T. horridus and several other species belonged together, and T. prorsus and T. brevicornus stood alone, and <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> many more specimens in the first group, she suggested that this meant the two groups were two species. It is still possible to interpret the differences as representing a single species with sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} Academy Awards {{ceremony}} {{was held on}} May 16, 1929 to honor films released in 1927–28, there was no separate category for foreign language films. Between 1947 and 1955, the Academy presented Special/Honorary Awards to the best foreign language films released in the United States. These awards, however, were not handed out {{on a regular basis}} (no award was given in 1953), and were not competitive <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no nominees but simply one winning film per year. For the 1956 Academy Awards, a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since then.|$|E

50|$|For π-electron ligands {{such as the}} cyclopentadienide ion C5H5−, alkenes and the cyclooctatetraenide ion C8H82−, {{the number}} of atoms in the π-electron system that bind to the central atom is termed the hapticity. In {{ferrocene}} the hapticity, η, of each cyclopentadienide anion <b>is</b> five, Fe(η5-C5H5)2. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> various ways of assigning the contribution made to the coordination number of the central iron atom by each cyclopentadienide ligand. The contribution could be assigned as one <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> one ligand, or as five <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> five neighbouring atoms, or as three <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> three electron pairs involved. Normally the count of electron pairs is taken.|$|R
