5|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} {{are typical}} of psychoses: third-person hallucinations (i.e. voices talking about the patient) and hearing one's thoughts spoken aloud (gedankenlautwerden or écho de la pensée) are among the Schneiderian first rank symptoms indicative of schizophrenia, whereas second-person hallucinations (voices talking to the patient) threatening or insulting or telling them to commit suicide, may be a feature of psychotic depression or schizophrenia. Visual hallucinations are generally <b>suggestive</b> <b>of</b> organic conditions such as epilepsy, drug intoxication or drug withdrawal. Many of the visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs are more correctly described as visual illusions or visual pseudohallucinations, as they are distortions of sensory experiences, and are not experienced as existing in objective reality. Auditory pseudohallucinations are <b>suggestive</b> <b>of</b> dissociative disorders. Déjà vu, derealization and depersonalization are associated with temporal lobe epilepsy and dissociative disorders.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids with Banksia marginata and B.integrifolia {{have been}} {{recorded}} at Nadgee Nature Reserve, where all three species occur. A study of an area of extensive hybridization between B.robur and B.oblongifolia at Barren Grounds Nature Reserve revealed some plants with morphology <b>suggestive</b> <b>of</b> B.paludosa in their parentage, and requiring further investigation.|$|E
5|$|The Ohio Burgee is the {{official}} flag of the U.S. state of Ohio. Ohio's swallowtail flag is the only non-rectangular U.S. state flag. Its red, white, and blue elements symbolize the state's natural features and order of admission into the Union. A prominent disc in the flag's triangular canton is <b>suggestive</b> <b>of</b> the state's name.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of subcutaneous emphysema {{in a person}} who appears quite ill and febrile after bout of vomiting followed by left chest pain is very <b>suggestive</b> <b>of</b> the diagnosis of Boerhaave's syndrome, which is a life-threatening emergency caused by rupture of the distal esophagus.|$|E
5|$|Archpriests {{and priests}} {{would use a}} less ornate mantle in their arms, and an ecclesiastical hat of the style they wear liturgically. Although an Orthodox monk (not an abbot) {{displaying}} personal arms is rare, a hieromonk (monk who has been ordained a priest) would appropriately display a monastic hat (klobuk) and a black cloak or veil <b>suggestive</b> <b>of</b> his attire, and a hierodeacon (monastic deacon) would display an orarion behind the shield.|$|E
5|$|Before her {{presentation}} to Charles, Isabeau visited Hainaut {{for about a}} month, staying with her granduncle Duke Albert I, ruler of some of Bavaria-Straubing and Count of Holland. Albert's wife, Margaret of Brieg, replaced Isabeau's Bavarian style of dress, deemed unsuitable as French courtly attire, and taught her etiquette suitable to the French court. She learned quickly, <b>suggestive</b> <b>of</b> an intelligent and quick-witted character. On 13July 1385 she traveled to Amiens to be presented to Charles.|$|E

5|$|Claiborne and Haw {{promoted}} Jesus for President {{by going}} on a U.S. speaking tour of 30 cities. The tour {{led up to the}} 2008 United States presidential election, and the book tour was <b>suggestive</b> <b>of</b> a third party candidate campaign for Jesus. The authors' speeches did not attempt to sway their audiences towards or away from any particular candidates, but rather encouraged them to endorse whichever candidates supported Christian values.|$|E
5|$|Drymoreomys albimaculatus {{appears to}} be a {{specialist}} of dense, moist, montane and premontane forest. It has been found in disturbed and secondary forests as well as in pristine forest, but probably needs contiguous forest to survive. Reproductive activity has been observed in females in June, November, and December and in males in December, suggesting that the species breeds year-round. Although some of its morphological traits, such as the very large pads, are <b>suggestive</b> <b>of</b> arboreal (tree-dwelling) habits, most specimens were collected in pitfall traps on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the finding}} of a {{combination}} of a low pituitary hormone together with a low hormone from the effector gland is indicative of hypopituitarism. Occasionally, the pituitary hormone may be normal but the effector gland hormone decreased; in this case, the pituitary is not responding appropriately to effector hormone changes, and the combination of findings is still <b>suggestive</b> <b>of</b> hypopituitarism.|$|E

5|$|His {{forms are}} usually abstractions {{of the human}} figure, {{typically}} depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures. Moore's works are usually <b>suggestive</b> <b>of</b> the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces. Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to the landscape and hills of his birthplace, Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|If the TSH {{level is}} normal or low and serum free T4 levels are low, this is <b>suggestive</b> <b>of</b> central {{hypothyroidism}} (not enough TSH or TRH secretion by the pituitary gland or hypothalamus). There {{may be other}} features of hypopituitarism, such as menstrual cycle abnormalities and adrenal insufficiency. There might also be symptoms of a pituitary mass such as headaches and vision changes. Central hypothyroidism should be investigated further to determine the underlying cause.|$|E
5|$|Myxedema coma {{is a rare}} but {{life-threatening}} {{state of}} extreme hypothyroidism. It may occur in those who {{are known to have}} hypothyroidism when they develop another illness, but it can be the first presentation of hypothyroidism. The illness is characterized by very low body temperature without shivering, confusion, a slow heart rate and reduced breathing effort. There may be physical signs <b>suggestive</b> <b>of</b> hypothyroidism, such as skin changes or enlargement of the tongue.|$|E

5|$|Performing a chest {{radiograph}} {{is one of}} {{the first}} investigative steps if a person reports symptoms that may suggest lung cancer. This may reveal an obvious mass, widening of the mediastinum (<b>suggestive</b> <b>of</b> spread to lymph nodes there), atelectasis (collapse), consolidation (pneumonia) or pleural effusion. CT imaging is typically used to provide more information about the type and extent of disease. Bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy is often used to sample the tumor for histopathology.|$|E
5|$|Polonium-210 may be {{quantified}} in biological specimens by alpha particle spectrometry to confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. The baseline urinary excretion of polonium-210 in healthy persons due to routine exposure to environmental sources is normally {{in a range of}} 5–15 mBq/day. Levels in excess of 30 mBq/day are <b>suggestive</b> <b>of</b> excessive exposure to the radionuclide.|$|E
5|$|Strength {{testing of}} these muscles can be {{measured}} during a neurological examination to assess function of the spinal accessory nerve. Poor strength or limited movement are <b>suggestive</b> <b>of</b> damage, which can result {{from a variety of}} causes. Injury to the spinal accessory nerve is most commonly caused by medical procedures that involve the head and neck. Injury can cause wasting of the shoulder muscles, winging of the scapula, and weakness of shoulder abduction and external rotation.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{clinical presentation}} of RRMS is the clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), that is, a single attack {{of a single}} symptom. During a CIS, there is a subacute attack <b>suggestive</b> <b>of</b> demyelination but the patient does not fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Treatment with interferons or glatiramer acetate after an initial attack decreases {{the risk of developing}} clinical definite MS.|$|E
