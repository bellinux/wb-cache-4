The latter was varied while the gears were operating by spraying liquid nitrogen onto the rotating gear wheel over a range of load and speed conditions. It was observed that the level of AE activity was dependent on the specific film thickness (?) and consequently the level asperity contact.

40|$|The {{application}} of high-frequency acoustic emission (AE) technology to condition monitoring of gears {{is still in}} its infancy. Understanding the influence of gear operating parameters on the generation of AE is essential in applying the AE technology to gear condition monitoring. This paper presents experimental findings on the influence of speed and load in generating AE for operating helical and spur gears. The experimental findings suggest that any percentage reduction in specific film thickness (gimel), a direct consequence of a change in load condition, results in a nine- and four-fold percentage change in AE rms for the <b>spur</b> <b>and</b> <b>helical</b> gear sets, respectively. A numerical model representing changes in AE rms with variation in load and speed under near isothermal conditions for <b>spur</b> <b>and</b> <b>helical</b> gears was also established. In conclusion, it is postulated that the AE technology could offer a means of measuring in situ the effectiveness of a lubricant for operational <b>spur</b> <b>and</b> <b>helical</b> gears thereby establishing if the correct lubricating conditions are present to ensure optimal life usage...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of transmission errors and bearing contact of <b>spur,</b> <b>helical</b> <b>and</b> {{spiral bevel gears}} was performed.

50|$|By 1896 Fellows had fully {{developed}} {{a new approach to}} gear cutting. Previously, gears had been milled, using cutters that were formed to the shape of the individual teeth. Upon the completion of each gear tooth, the gear blank was indexed to a new position to mill the next tooth, which could lead to problems in accurate spacing of gear teeth and the shaping of the individual teeth. Fellows conceived a method whereby the gear cutter, which was itself a gear with hardened cutting edges, and gear blank revolved together as if they were a pair of gears. This process required no intermediate template or other type of mechanical guide for shaping the gear. Hobbing has become the preferred approach to manufacturing <b>spur</b> gears <b>and</b> <b>helical</b> gears.|$|R

Based on a multidegree-of-freedom gear model, a unique scalar equation for transmission error is established. The role of profile relief is analyzed by using Fourier series and it is shown that transmission error fluctuations depend on a very limited number of parameters representative of gear geometry and profile relief definition. An original direct solution to the optimum relief minimizing transmission error fluctuations is presented, which {{is believed to be}} helpful for designers. The analytical results compare well with the numerical results provided by a variety of models and it is demonstrated that some general laws of evolution for transmission error fluctuations versus profile modifications can be established for <b>spur</b> <b>and</b> <b>helical</b> gears...|$|E
40|$|Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) {{philosophy}} has become widely accepted by most industries {{today as a}} key element in reducing operating cost, and increasing safety and life cycle costs within a environmentally friendly umbrella. One of the important keys to successful CBM is condition monitoring. The investigation reported in this thesis is centred on the application of Acoustic Emissions (AE) technology for condition monitoring of the operational <b>spur</b> <b>and</b> <b>helical</b> gears. Since the application of AE in gear condition monitoring is still under development, understanding the main source of AE during <b>spur</b> <b>and</b> <b>helical</b> gear mesh and the influence of operating parameters on the generation of AE activity is essential. The surface fatigue life of the gears is very much dependent on the specific lm thickness (Ä) value, which is a ratio of oil lm thickness (h) over the composite surface roughness (cms) of the meshing surfaces, during their operations. Thus, the aim of this research programme is to investigate and understand the influence of specific lm thickness (Ä) on the generation of AE activity during <b>spur</b> <b>and</b> <b>helical</b> gear mesh under various operating conditions. A series of experimental investigations were undertaken and these showed that changes in load, speed, temperature, surface roughness and lubricant viscosity influenced the generation of AE. Findings from the tests strongly suggest that asperity contact is the main source of AE during <b>spur</b> <b>and</b> <b>helical</b> gear mesh. In addition, the meshing mechanisms of <b>spur</b> <b>and</b> <b>helical</b> gears are shown to contribute distinct characteristics of AE. Finally, the correlation between specific lm thickness (Ä) and AE r. m. s. established from the investigation, shows the potential of AE technology to monitor lubrication regimes of operational <b>spur</b> <b>and</b> <b>helical</b> gears. This extends the potential of AE technology not only to detect incipient failures during gear operation but also to prevent failure from occurring. With knowledge of the lubrication regime, gear failure associated with wear could be eliminated or reduced and thus increase the reliability of the gears during their operation. i It is concluded that the experimental findings of this research programme will form the foundations for significant advancement in the application of AE to identify the lubrication regime within a gearbox, thereby ensuring optimal conditions for prolonged life.

A 23 -percent weight reduction has been demonstrated for a high output reduction ratio split path transmission compared to an aggressive program goal of 25 -percent.

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} time-varying (NLTV) {{dynamic model}} of a hypoid gear pair system with time-dependent mesh point, line-of-action vector, mesh stiffness, mesh damping, and backlash nonlinearity is formulated to analyze the transitional phase between nonlinear jump phenomenon and linear response. It is found that the classical jump discontinuity will occur if the dynamic mesh force exceeds the mean value of tooth mesh force. On the other hand, the propensity for the gear response to jump disappears when the dynamic mesh force {{is lower than the}} mean mesh force. Furthermore, the dynamic analysis is able to distinguish the specific tooth impact types from analyzing the behaviors of the dynamic mesh force.

40|$|Gears are {{components}} in mechanical assemblies used for transmitting power and motion. Gear form cutting (broaching, milling) and gear generating (shaping and hobbing) {{are two of}} the main gear manufacturing methods. Usually production involves three stages: (i) soft machining, (ii) heat treatment, and (iii) hard machining. Limitations introduced by conventional methods can be listed as follows: - In machining difficult to cut materials, high cost of specialized cutting tools, high cutting tool failures is a major issue and high cost of machine tools. - Stresses generated due to heat (thermal stresses) and cutting force affect the component life and cost. This demands alternative ways of material removal without affecting the mechanical properties while delivering right quality in a cost effective way which is the goal of the industry. - Increasing standards on environmental impacts associated with products force the modern manufacturing industry to take critical approach on making processes environmental friendly. Large volume of material is removed during conventional gear production resulting in higher lead time, more use of cutting fluids (and its disposal), chip handling (and its disposal) and dust. In this context, abrasive waterjet (AWJ) cutting {{is considered to be a}} good addition to the current production system due to the low amount of applied force, negligible heat generated during machining, minimal change in material properties, versatility, lower initial investment and environmental friendliness (no chip generation and no need for cutting fluids). To demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach in manufacturing <b>spur</b> gears <b>and</b> <b>helical</b> gears, forged gear blanks typically used on automobile industry were used for initial tests and two gears were produced using 3 -axis KimTech and 5 -axis FineCut precision AWJ machine tools. Individual teeth have been separated from each gear and tested against each other from different perspectives. The metrological, surface integrity, productivity and production cost comparisons were presented. While improvements were achieved from environment and surface integrity perspectives, AWJ cutting cannot replace soft machining stage due to increased lead time and production cost. Novel hybrid gear manufacturing method was proposed from the experiences from this research and compared against the conventional method employed in the automotive industry. Proposed hybrid approach comprises AWJ cutting process as the major material removal method and conventional 5 -axis machining for final finishing or maintenance of tight tolerances and at the same time, decreasing initial investment and adding further flexibility to production system.
