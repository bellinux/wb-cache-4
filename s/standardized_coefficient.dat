50|$|Disadvantages: Critics voice {{concerns}} {{that such a}} standardization can be misleading. Since standardizing a variable removes the unit of measurement from its value, a <b>standardized</b> <b>coefficient</b> for a given relationship only represents its strength relative to the variation in the distributions. This invites bias due to sampling error when one standardizes variables using {{means and standard deviations}} based on small samples. Furthermore, a change of one standard deviation in one variable is only equivalent to a change of one standard deviation in another predictor insofar as the shapes of the two variables' distributions resemble one another. The meaning of a standard deviation may vary markedly between non-normal distributions (e.g., when skewed or otherwise asymmetrical). This underscores the importance of normality assumptions in parametric statistics, and poses an additional problem when interpreting <b>standardized</b> <b>coefficient</b> estimates that even nonparametric regression does not solve when dealing with non-normal distributions.|$|E

For univariate regression, the absolute value of the <b>standardized</b> <b>coefficient</b> equals the correlation coefficient.

To {{investigate}} the simultaneous association of several psychophysical measures with reading ability {{in patients with}} mild and moderate low vision attending rehabilitation services. METHODS. Standard measurements of reading ability (Minnesota Reading [MNREAD] charts), visual acuity (Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] charts), contrast sensitivity (Pelli-Robson charts), reading contrast threshold (Reading Explorer [REX] charts), retinal sensitivity, and fixation stability and localization (Micro Perimeter 1 [MP 1] fundus perimetry) were obtained in 160 low vision patients with better eye visual acuity ranging from 0. 3 to 1. 0 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution and affected by either age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy. RESULTS. All variables were moderately associated with reading performance measures (MNREAD reading speed and reading acuity and REX reading contrast threshold), as well as among each other. In a structural equation model, REX reading contrast threshold was highly associated with MNREAD reading speed (<b>standardized</b> <b>coefficient,</b> 0. 63) and moderately associated with reading acuity (<b>standardized</b> <b>coefficient,</b> - 0. 30). REX test also mediated the effects of Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity (<b>standardized</b> <b>coefficient,</b> 0. 44), MP 1 fixation eccentricity (<b>standardized</b> <b>coefficient,</b> 0. 19), and the mean retinal sensitivity (<b>standardized</b> <b>coefficient,</b> 0. 23) on reading performance. The MP 1 fixation stability was associated with both MNREAD reading acuity (<b>standardized</b> <b>coefficient,</b> - 0. 24) and MNREAD reading speed (<b>standardized</b> <b>coefficient,</b> 0. 23), while ETDRS visual acuity only affected reading acuity (<b>standardized</b> <b>coefficient,</b> 0. 44). CONCLUSIONS. Fixation instability and contrast sensitivity loss are key factors limiting reading performance of patients with mild or moderate low vision.

Therefore, we additionally refer to effect sizes and focus on regression coefficients larger than one-third of the standard deviation of class-level constructs (i.e., in the class-level part of the respective doubly latent variables). Since standard deviations in our sample reach up to [...]. 598, we consider b and Δb > . 200 as evidence supporting our hypotheses. Reports of unstandardized regression coefficients are common practice when testing moderation by way of multigroup comparisons. The reason for this {{lies in the fact that}} the standard deviations are usually not equal among the compared groups. Because standard deviations of both the independent and the dependent variables are used to convert unstandardized into <b>standardized</b> <b>coefficients,</b> differing standard deviations may lead to unequal <b>standardized</b> <b>coefficients</b> between groups, even in the case of equal unstandardized coefficients. Indeed, even if models are specified such that structural paths are constrained to be equal between groups, the comparison of <b>standardized</b> <b>coefficients</b> can yield artificial differences that are due to differing standard deviations between groups and not to true moderation. In the present paper, we thus use unstandardized coefficients to report moderated associations but also to document direct and mediated associations in order to ensure consistency throughout all tables and figures. That way, we additionally avoid overestimating expected positive relations. Owing to moderate between-class variability, the <b>standardized</b> <b>coefficients</b> available for mediation models in Mplus are indeed very high for our variables (on average, β = . 7 for relations of teaching characteristics with students’ enjoyment of lessons).|$|R

SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH, Vol. 5 No. 3, February 1977 A computational error in the application of multiple regression computer programs to two-stage least squares estimation of the <b>standardized</b> <b>coefficients</b> for nonrecursive models leads to the understatement of the relative size of reciprocal effects. Furthermore, an error in the computation of the disturb-ance variance invalidates significance tests for the metric coefficients. The sources of the errors are derived and an example is presented. The example reveals that not only do the incorrectly computed <b>standardized</b> <b>coefficients</b> underestimate reciprocal effects, they also may lead to specious conclusions regarding group differences in the relative impact of causal variables. although one-step methods for the computation of two-stage least squares (2 SLS) estimates of the param-eters of nonrecursive structural equation models have been. known for some time (e. g., Goldberger, 1964), most package programs, e. g., SPSS (Nie et al., 1975), do not include one-step routines.
