40|$|With the {{continued}} growth in availability of DInSAR and GPS data, <b>space</b> based <b>geodesy</b> {{has been widely}} applied to image the coseismic displacement field and to retrieve the static dislocation over the fault plane for almost all the significant earthquakes {{of the past two}} decades. This is performed by linear data inversion over a set of subfaults, generally characterized by a constant and predefined or manually adjusted dimensions. In this paper we propose a new algorithm to automatically retrieve an optimized fault subdivision in the linear inversion of coseismic geodetic data. The code iteratively keeps the parameter resolution close to a predefined high value. We first discuss the rationale supporting our algorithm and, after a detailed description of its implementation, we analyze the advantages of its introduction in the data inversion. The algorithm was tested against an exhaustive range of synthetic and real datasets and fault mechanisms.

The objects of study are satellites of the outer planets (satellites of Jupiter - Europa, Calisto and Ganymede; Saturnine satellite Enceladus), some planets (Mercury and Mars) and the satellites of the terrestrial planets - Phobos (Mars) and the Moon (Earth). The new research project, which started in 2014, will address the following important scientific and practical tasks: - Creating new three-dimensional geodetic control point networks of satellites of the outer planets using innovative photogrammetry techniques; - Determination of fundamental geodetic parameters and study size, shape, and spin parameters and to create the basic framework for research of their surfaces; - Studies of relief of planetary bodies and comparative analysis of general surface characteristics of the Moon, Mars, and Mercury, as well as studies of morphometric parameters of volcanic formations on the Moon and Mars; - Modeling of meteoritic bombardment of celestial bodies {{and the study of}} the dynamics of particle emissions caused by a meteorite impacts; - Development of geodatabase for studies of planetary bodies, including creation of object catalogues, (craters and volcanic forms, etc.), and thematic mapping using GIS technology. The significance of the project is defined both by necessity of obtaining fundamental characteristics of the Solar System bodies, and practical tasks in preparation for future Russian and international space missions to the Jupiter system (Laplace-P and JUICE), the Moon (Luna-Glob and Luna-Resource), Mars (Exo-Mars), Mercury (Bepi-Colombo), and possible mission to Phobos (project Boomerang). For cartographic support of future missions, we have created various maps as results of first year research: new base maps of Ganymede, including a hypsometric map and a global surface map; the base and thematic maps of Phobos which were updated using new image data sets from Mars Express; a newest map of topographic roughness of Mercury (for north polar area) 2 and a map of topographic roughness of the Moon using laser altimeter data processing obtained by MESSENGER (MLA) and LRO (LOLA) for their comparative analyses; a new global hypsometric map of the Moon.

40|$|Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) has a {{rich history}} of {{development}} {{which began in}} the 1960 s with 10 meter-level first generation systems. These systems evolved with order of magnitude improvements to the systems that now produce several millimeter single shot range precisions. What began, in part, as an interesting application of the new laser technology has become an essential component of modern, precision <b>space</b> <b>geodesy,</b> which in turn enables contributions to a variety of science areas. Modern <b>space</b> <b>geodesy</b> is the beneficiary of technological developments which have enabled precision geodetic measurements. Aside from SLR and its closely related technique, Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR), Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) has made prominent science contributions also. In recent years, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has demonstrated a rapidly growing popularity as the result of demonstrated low cost with high precision instrumentation. Other modern techniques such as DORIS have demonstrated the ability to make significant science contributions; furthermore, PRARE can be expected to contribute in its own right. An appropriate question is 'why should several techniques be financially supported'? While there are several answers, I offer the opinion that, in consideration of the broad science areas that are the benefactors of <b>space</b> <b>geodesy,</b> no single technique can meet all the requirements and/or expectations of the science areas in which <b>space</b> <b>geodesy</b> contributes or has the potential for contributing. The more well-known science areas include plate tectonics, earthquake processes, Earth rotation/orientation, gravity (static and temporal), ocean circulation, land, and ice topography, to name a few applications. It is unfortunate that the modern <b>space</b> <b>geodesy</b> techniques are often viewed as competitive, but this view is usually encouraged by funding competition, especially in an era of growing needs but diminishing budgets. The techniques are, for the most part, complementary and the ability to reduce the data to geodetic parameters from several techniques promotes confidence in the geophysical interpretations.
