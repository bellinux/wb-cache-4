40|$|Doogan is a {{judgment}} of the Inner House of the Scottish Court of Session in an action brought by two midwives (‘petitioners’ at first instance and ‘reclaimers’ on appeal) for judicial review of a decision by Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board (‘respondents’). At issue in the litigation was the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the conscience-based exemption contained in section 4 (1) of the Abortion Act 1967, which included consideration of where the burden of managing the exemption should fall. The court of first instance (Outer House) had held that section 4 (1), which exempts people with a conscientious objection from having to ‘participate in any treatment authorised by this Act’, ought to be read in light of section 1, which was the authorising provision. On the analysis adopted by the Outer House, any activity which was not unlawful before the 1967 Act came into force, and which therefore did not require to be authorised by section 1, was not covered by section 4 (1). Roles which consisted of ‘supervision, delegation, and support’ were held not to fall within the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> section 4 (1) for this reason. The Inner House rejected {{the argument that the}} <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the exemption in section 4 (1) must be coextensive with the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>authorisation</b> in section 1, and held that section 4 (1) covered the ‘whole process of treatment’ given for the purpose of terminating a pregnancy. For the Inner House, therefore, ‘supervision, delegation, and support’ of staff directly involved in the abortion process did constitute the kind of ‘participation’ that a person could be exempted from under section 4 (1). Moreover, the court took the view that the reclaimers' interpretation of section 4 (1) was also to be preferred in terms of its likely management consequences. The appeal succeeded, and the Health Board has begun the process of appealing to the UK Supreme Court...|$|R
40|$|In a {{community}} that takes rights seriously, consent features pervasively in both moral and legal discourse as a justifying reason: stated simply, where there is consent, {{there can be no}} complaint. However, without a clear appreciation of the nature of a consent-based justification, its integrity, both in principle and in practice, is liable to be compromised. This book examines the role of consent as a procedural justification, discussing the prerequisites for an adequate consent [...] in particular, that an agent with the relevant capacity has made an unforced and informed choice, that the consent has been clearly signalled, and that the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>authorisation</b> covers the act in question. It goes on to highlight both the Fallacy of Necessity (where there is no consent, there must be a wrong) and the Fallacy of Sufficiency (where there is consent, there cannot be a wrong). Finally, {{the extent to which the}} authority of law itself rests on consent is considered. If the familiarity of consent-based justification engenders confusion and contempt, the analysis in this book acts as a corrective, identifying a range of abusive or misguided practices that variously under-value or over-value consent, that fictionalise it or that are fixated by it, and that treat it too casually or too cautiously. In short, the analysis in Consent in the Law points the way towards recognising an important procedural justification for precisely what it is as well as giving it a more coherent application...|$|R

The synthesis of new policies should be based {{on the state of the}} authorization system, the evolution of that state, and the detected insider threats. Since the current solution relies on profiling the behavior of subjects, and the usage of resources, history is an integral part in the synthesis of detectors. How far in the past should the solution rely, it depends on the type of detectors that are needed. For example, for detecting slow attacks, the detectors should rely on large windows of observability depending on the specified attack model.|$|R

40|$|Both human {{analysts and}} {{particularly}} automated tool suites {{are capable of}} deriving sensitive information and conclusions from collections of data items that individually cannot be considered critical or sensitive. This activity of analysing and correlating material that is not immediately related is, in fact, highly desirable in many application areas and cannot be controlled precisely in advance. The decision whether a program or an analyst is performing searches and correlations beyond the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> his <b>authorisation</b> or current mission can frequently be determined only ex post based on a heuristic analysis of documents accessed. In this paper we describe a mechanism for the instrumentation of operating systems to obtain information on the documents and resources accessed by arbitrary processes. Such a mechanism could be {{an important component of}} the infrastructure of an operational risk management system, generating an audit trail for compliance and forensic investigation, and acting as a sensor generating data for analysis. Addressing the latter application, the paper also outlines an approach for extracting textual information and metadata from accessed documents, regardless of the application program and workflow mechanisms used, without unduly impeding either workflows or operator performance. This information can then be subjected to an heuristic analysis based on natural language processing to extract the semantic context of each document or segment. Clustering this content and extracting the conceptual patterns that a user has accessed can then allow abnormal behaviour to be identified. This can then be refined further to determine heuristically whether the authorised remit of the user has been breached and whether an investigation is warranted. We argue that the risk of misbehaviour can be reduced while at the same time increasing productivity. This is made possible by enhancing the degree of freedom for individual users to act in the interest of their mission objectives and at the same time providing automated mechanisms for analysing user behaviour...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} 'authorisation' {{was one of}} the {{innovations}} under the (Imperial) Copyright Act of 1911. The concept, which has found its way into many common law countries jurisprudence, has been very crucial in imposing secondary liability on parties whose services have been used by a third party to infringe an intellectual property right. However, the law of secondary liability is one of the areas badly understood under intellectual property rights. This position has been compounded by technologies which are of dual use. Though secondary liability for copyright infringement is a creation of statutes both in the UK and Australia, the courts have tried to delimit the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> liability incurred by a party for authorising, sanctioning or 'participating' in an infringing act. Comparing the Nigerian position with that of the UK and Australia, this paper examines the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> 'causes [...] . to do', an equivalent of the tort <b>of</b> <b>authorisation,</b> under the Nigerian Copyright Act 2004.

40|$|Abstract. Trust Management is an {{approach}} to construct and interpret the trust relationships among public-keys {{that are used to}} mediate security-critical actions. Cryptographic credentials are used to specify delegation <b>of</b> <b>authorisation</b> among public keys. Existing trust management schemes are operational in nature, defining security in terms of specific controls such as delegation chains, threshold schemes, and so forth. However, they tend not to consider whether a particular authorisation policy is well designed in the sense that a principle cannot somehow bypass the intent of a complex series <b>of</b> <b>authorisation</b> delegations via some unexpected circuitous route. In this paper we consider the problem <b>of</b> <b>authorisation</b> subterfuge, whereby, in a poorly designed system, delegation chains that are used by principals to prove authorisation may not actually reflect the original intention of all {{of the participants in the}} chain. A logic is proposed that provides a systematic way of determining whether a particular delegation scheme using particular authorisation is sufficiently robust to be able to withstand attempts at subterfuge. This logic provides a new characterisation of certificate reduction that, we argue, is more appropriate to open systems. ...|$|R
