5|$|Again, {{this is a}} simplification, {{based on}} a {{hypothetical}} Earth that orbits at uniform speed around the Sun. The actual <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> which Earth orbits the Sun varies slightly during the year, so the <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> which the Sun seems to move along the ecliptic also varies. For example, the Sun is north of the celestial equator for about 185 days of each year, and south of it for about 180 days. The variation of orbital speed accounts {{for part of the}} equation of time.|$|E
5|$|Cray {{had always}} {{attacked}} {{the problem of}} increased <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> three simultaneous advances; more execution units to give the system higher parallelism, tighter packaging to decrease signal delays, and faster components {{to allow for a}} higher clock speed. Of the three, Cray was normally least aggressive on the last; his designs tended to use components that were already in widespread use, as opposed to leading-edge designs.|$|E

5|$|As {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} in California since the 1989 Loma Prieta event several years earlier, the mainshock caused a non-destructive tsunami that quickly reached the coast, and eventually Alaska and Hawaii several hours later. The tsunami was significant {{not because of}} its run-up, {{but because of the}} <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> which it reached the coast and for how long the waves persisted. Other strong earthquakes have affected the same area, with some that were clearly associated with the (interplate) Mendocino Fracture Zone, and others (like the two shocks on April 26) were intraplate earthquakes that ruptured within the Gorda Plate, but events that are unequivocally associated with the Cascadia subduction zone are very infrequent.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{commercial}} success of her early novels such as Adventures of the Wishing-Chair (1937) and The Enchanted Wood (1939), Blyton {{went on to}} build a literary empire, sometimes producing fifty books a year {{in addition to her}} prolific magazine and newspaper contributions. Her writing was unplanned and sprang largely from her unconscious mind; she typed her stories as events unfolded before her. The sheer volume of her work and the <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> which it was produced led to rumours that Blyton employed an army of ghost writers, a charge she vigorously denied.|$|E
5|$|For {{additional}} maneuverability, the turuma carried 19 pairs (16 in {{the first}} two ships) of oars with four men per oar. Oarsmen rowed sitting on the weather deck, above the gun deck, with the oarports attached to a rectangular outrigger that was designed to improve the leverage. Despite this, turumas performed poorly under oars and were very difficult to move in any kind of contrary wind. In calm weather the average <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> oars was reported as low as half a knot.|$|E

5|$|McCarthy's {{judicial}} career attracted {{some controversy}} {{because of the}} <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> which he dispatched many of his cases as he worked to clear the heavily backlogged docket he had inherited. Wisconsin had strict divorce laws, but when McCarthy heard divorce cases, he expedited them whenever possible, and he made {{the needs of children}} involved in contested divorces a priority. When it came to other cases argued before him, McCarthy compensated for his lack of experience as a jurist by demanding and relying heavily upon precise briefs from the contesting attorneys. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed a low percentage of the cases he heard, but he was also censured in 1941 for having lost evidence in a price fixing case.|$|E
5|$|Norway sent {{a strong}} {{contingent}} with four jumpers {{able to win}} the event, including reigning Olympic and world champion Jacob Tullin Thams. Andersen had won all eight Norwegian qualification events. World record holder Nels Nelsen from Canada was not permitted to participate due to financial problems. Japan participated in an international ski jumping competition for the first time, also becoming the first Asian country to do so. After the first jump, three Norwegians were in the lead. A 40-minute discussion erupted regarding the <b>speed,</b> <b>with</b> Central European jumpers wanting it increased. This was complied with by the jury, resulting in falls by several favorites, including the most vocal speed increase proponents, Gérard Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani. Andersen and Ruud won by reducing their speed on the in-run.|$|E

5|$|Players {{are first}} {{brought to the}} options screen, where the {{starting}} level, game speed, and music can be chosen. The initial level chosen is a value between zero and twenty that determines the number of viruses to clear, and the three-game speed options change how fast the capsules fall within the bottle. The player's score is {{based solely on the}} elimination of viruses and the chosen game <b>speed,</b> <b>with</b> bonus points for clearing more than 1 in a single line. After level 20 you can still accumulate points but the number of viruses to clear remains the same.|$|E
5|$|Sound {{movement}} {{through the atmosphere}} is affected by wind shear, which can bend the wave front, causing sounds to be heard where they normally would not, or vice versa. Strong vertical wind shear within the troposphere also inhibits tropical cyclone development, but helps to organize individual thunderstorms into living longer life cycles that can then produce severe weather. The thermal wind concept explains how differences in wind <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> height are dependent on horizontal temperature differences, and explains {{the existence of the}} jet stream.|$|E
5|$|The Sholes and Glidden was {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} typewriter. Industrialization and corporate growth in the late 19th century produced a business environment for which the device was well suited. New communications technologies, such as the telegraph and telephone, facilitated geographic expansion and increased the <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> which business was conducted. The resulting increase in the volume of correspondence required messages to be produced quickly and legibly. Before the typewriter, clerks and copyists could write relatively quickly in shorthand or longhand. The comprehension of these scripts, however, required either special training or close concentration. Typesetting was used when legibility was important, {{but it was a}} slow and expensive process. The typewriter succeeded because it simultaneously addressed both issues.|$|E

5|$|The most {{challenging}} {{stage of the}} takeoff is carrying the speed from the inrun with sufficient height over the 'knoll', and achieving the correct trajectory down the hill. The knoll is the highest point of the hill itself, from which it begins to slope downwards. On modern ski flying hills the table is placed considerably far back from the knoll, so as to reduce the steepness of the flight curve. A skilled athlete is able to aggressively 'snap' into the transition so as to clear the knoll with ease, thereby allowing them to focus completely on using their specialised aerodynamic flying technique to maximise distance further down the hill. Athletes of the highest skill level can consistently compensate for any lack of inrun <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> perfect timing {{off the table and}} an excellent transition.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{thought in}} Victorian healthcare concerning {{the transmission of}} contagious diseases was the miasma theory, which held that most communicable diseases were caused by the inhalation of contaminated air. This contamination could {{take the form of}} the odour of rotting corpses or sewage, but also rotting vegetation, or the exhaled breath of someone already diseased. Miasma was believed by most to be the vector of transmission of cholera, which was on the rise in 19th-century Europe. The disease was deeply feared by all, because of the <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> which it could spread, and its high fatality rates.|$|E
5|$|The road charged 25 cents ($ {{in modern}} dollars) for saddle horses and twice that for two-axle stagecoaches. The tolls, {{collected}} at three separate gates, primarily reflected {{the cost of}} retaining a large crew of men with snow shovels to keep the road open in wintertime; {{they were able to}} keep the road open through its first five winters. When the snow was too deep, sleighs were used instead. During the summer the stages were able to take the switchbacks at full <b>speed,</b> <b>with</b> dogs running in advance to warn other traffic. A typical voyage over the pass required 10–25 hours and five changes of horses.|$|E

5|$|The ships' hulls were {{constructed}} from longitudinal steel frames. The hulls {{were divided into}} fourteen watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for 72percent {{of the length of}} the keel. The Kriegsmarine regarded the ships as good sea boats, with gentle motion. At low speed, however, they were affected unpredictably by wind and currents. The ships heeled up to fourteen degrees and lost up to 50% <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> the rudder hard over at high speed. The ships had a standard complement of 42officers and 1,340enlisted men. Wartime modifications increased the crew to 51officers and 1,548sailors. The ships carried several smaller vessels, including two picket boats, two barges, one launch, one pinnace, and two dinghies.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} epithet, tigris, {{as well as}} {{the common}} name, tiger, come from the Middle English tigre and the Old English tigras (a plural word), both used for the animal. These derive from the Old French tigre, itself a derivative of the Latin word tigris and the Greek word tigris. The original source may have been the Persian tigra meaning pointed or sharp and the Avestan tigrhi meaning an arrow, perhaps referring to the <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> which a tiger launches itself at its prey. It is worth mentioning that Mesopotamia, where the Caspian tiger had occurred, has a river called 'Tigris'.|$|E
