Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music used [...] "Stephen" [...] {{as an example}} of the songs on Animal that exemplified the singer's vocals, saying it had [...] "beautiful layered a cappella harmonies. Sure, it tumbles into clunky pop straight afterwards, but then, that also <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> she does: beautiful things are bashed against ugly things, pretty melodies ruined by silly noises, emotional lyrics stuffed with buzzwords." [...] Daniel Brockman of The Boston Phoenix wrote of the album that [...] "in a post–'Birthday Sex' pop landscape, there's plenty of room for dumb if it's done well." [...] He described [...] "Stephen" [...] as [...] "an ode to forcing your sexual advances on your high-school history teacher." [...] Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times listed the song as one of those that exemplified the album's more experimental side, calling it a [...] "country-in-space" [...] rendition.|$|E

2500|$|John Mitchell of MTV News praised Knowles' dance {{skills and}} sexiness {{in the video}} despite being pregnant, and called it [...] "a feast for the eyes" [...] and [...] "a perfect mix of classic and modern, which <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> Beyoncé is aiming for {{in this era of}} her career". A writer of The Huffington Post {{described}} the video as [...] "characteristically kinetic". Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound wrote that [...] "the concept may be simple, but the intricate dance numbers (take that, Fred Astaire!) and split screen action make for an energetic cinematic affair with loads of modern swag and '60s-inspired sass." [...] Joe Marvilli of the same publication wrote that the retro horns in the song, match the 1960s [...] "throwback visuals" [...] as Knowles [...] "sashes through a variety of classy outfits and energetic dance moves. It's as full of sass and swagger, as if she'd give us any less". Entertainment Weeklys Grady Smith compared Knowles with Nicki Minaj and called the video a [...] "typical Beyoncé dance-fest featuring frenetic movement, flashing colors, {{and a whole lot of}} sexy outfits". Contessa Gayles of [...] The Boombox also compared Knowles look and make-up in the video with Minajs style. Lisa Potter of Marie Claire compared Knowles with Andy Warhol. Carrie Battan of Pitchfork Media called it a [...] "clean and classic, filled with blocked colors, Audrey Hepburn stylings and the occasional flashing of the baby bump". Luke Jennings of The Guardian called the video a [...] "slick, very new-retro piece of film-making, and borrowed imagery is absolutely the point of it". Stereogum wrote that the video [...] "has [...] potential to be the most electric Beyoncé video since the immortal classic 'Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)'". Similarly, Matt Donnelly of Los Angeles Times described the video as [...] "so fantastic it borders on annoying" [...] and added that it could be a miniature version of [...] "Single Ladies". AOL Musics Marina Galperina called the video [...] "mod-tastic" [...] and the editing [...] "funky" [...] and [...] "collaged".|$|E

Well, I was deeply interested in this curious question, and also {{in some of the}} results which I obtained from working with fixed air in combination with a substance I had produced from the essential oil of a weed known to us in England as lady's mantle, but which the learned Mr. Carl Linnæus describes in his system as Alchemilla vulgaris. From that weed I obtained an oil which I combined with a certain decoction of fixed air into a remarkable compound; and to this compound, from its singular properties, I proposed to give the name of Pausodyne. For some years I was almost wholly engaged in investigating the conduct of this remarkable agent; and lest I should weary you by entering into too much detail, I may as well say at once that it possessed the singular power of entirely suspending animation in men or animals for several hours together. It is a highly volatile oil, like ammonia in smell, but much thicker in gravity; and when held to the nose of an animal, it causes immediate stoppage of the heart's action, making the body seem quite dead for long periods at a time. But the moment a mixture of the pausodyne with oil of vitriol and gum resin is presented to the nostrils, the animal instantaneously revives exactly as before, showing no evil effects whatsoever from its temporary simulation of death. To the reviving mixture I have given the appropriate name of Anegeiric.|$|E

50|$|Menander was {{the most}} {{successful}} of these three comedians. His comedies not only provided their audience with a brief respite from reality, but also gave audiences an accurate, while not greatly detailed, picture of life. This led an ancient critic to ask if life influenced Menander {{in the writing of}} his plays or if the case was vice versa. Unlike predecessors such as Aristophanes, Menander's comedies tended to center on the fears and foibles of the ordinary man, his personal relationships, family life and social mishaps rather than politics and public life. This <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> made him more successful than the other Greek comedians who wrote in the same genre.
