5|$|A {{waterspout}} is a columnar vortex forming {{over water}} that is, {{in its most}} common form, a non-supercell tornado over water that is connected to a cumuliform cloud. While it is often weaker than most of its land counterparts, stronger versions <b>spawned</b> <b>by</b> mesocyclones do occur.|$|E
5|$|Defenders of Ardania is a tower defense {{game that}} also has {{offensive}} real-time strategy elements. As with all tower defense games, the player must defend their home base by building {{several types of}} static tower units that fire at weak offensive units <b>spawned</b> <b>by</b> the opponent. In Defenders of Ardania, however, players must also spawn soldiers themselves. Like the opponent's soldiers, the player's soldiers move along a fixed path towards their opponent's base and cannot be directly maneuvered by the player. The game is won if units <b>spawned</b> <b>by</b> the player get past the opponent's towers and destroy the opponent's base before the opponent's units get past the player's towers and destroy the player's base.|$|E
5|$|September 26, 2002– Tropical Storm Isidore hits {{southern}} Louisiana, {{though its}} large circulation drops rainfall {{across the state}} peaking at 9.1inches (231mm) in Pensacola. Tornadoes <b>spawned</b> <b>by</b> the storm damage multiple mobile homes, with monetary damage across the state totaling over $11million (2002USD, $14.8million 2017USD).|$|E

50|$|The {{breeding}} season and spawning times can be shifted thus expanding the seasonal range of production. This {{leads to more}} efficient aquaculture because fry are available to the market year round. Hormonal treatments can advance <b>spawning</b> <b>by</b> two to three weeks. Manipulating photoperiod can alter <b>spawning</b> time <b>by</b> over four months and is cheap and straightforward to achieve.|$|R
50|$|Aquarists can {{sometimes}} trigger <b>spawning</b> <b>by</b> duplicating the natural conditions where fish would breed. Raising the water temperature, lowering the water level, and feeding mosquito larvae {{are examples of}} things that work for certain species.|$|R
5|$|A typhoon {{approached}} eastern Luzon on September 16, {{and moved}} across the island on the next day. In the municipality of Baler on the east coast, a minimum pressure of 969 mbar (28.63 inHg) was recorded. The typhoon's eye passed over and nearly destroyed the town. A tornado <b>spawned</b> <b>by</b> the typhoon hit Metro Manila. The typhoon progressed westward into the South China Sea, later curving to the northwest and entering the Gulf of Tonkin near the island of Hainan. After the storm, the Philippine government provided aid to residents.|$|E
5|$|In nearby Bangladesh, {{strong winds}} {{produced}} by the storm destroyed 500homes across 11villages. Areas devastated by a tornado a month prior were severely affected by the cyclone. In Tangail, a powerful tornado <b>spawned</b> <b>by</b> the storm destroyed 2,000 homes and killed 10 people. At least 60people perished and 2,000 others were injured across the country. Offshore, 150 fishermen went missing during the storm and were feared dead. In {{the wake of the}} storm, widespread search and rescue missions took place in cities flattened by the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{this period}} {{represented}} a high point in Galveston's economy. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the open era or the wide-open era because the business owners and the community made little effort to hide the illegal vice activities. The tourist industry <b>spawned</b> <b>by</b> the illegal businesses helped to offset Galveston's decline as a commercial and shipping center following a devastating hurricane in 1900. However, crackdowns against gambling and prostitution in Texas during the mid-20th century made these businesses increasingly difficult to sustain. By the 1950s, this era of Galveston's history had ended.|$|E
50|$|The species reaches sexual {{maturity}} at {{about two years}} of age. Like most characins, this species <b>spawns</b> <b>by</b> intermittently releasing and fertilizing eggs among plants. It frequently eats its own eggs, so keepers remove the fish after spawning.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{substantial}} canopy cover provided by maple sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) and European alder (Alnus glutinosa), which allows <b>spawning</b> <b>by</b> the resident population of Brown trout and migratory populations of sea trout (Salmo trutta) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) ...|$|R

5|$|Of the season's five {{tropical}} cyclones, three reached hurricane status. However, {{none of them}} strengthened into major hurricanes, {{which are}} Category3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Along with 1901, {{this was the first}} time that two consecutive seasons lacked a major hurricane since 1864 and 1865. Only one storm left significant impact, which was the second hurricane. It brought flooding and strong winds to Texas, resulting in severe damage in some areas. A tornado <b>spawned</b> <b>by</b> the storm also caused five fatalities.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center issued {{tropical}} storm warnings for the coastline and residents in some counties were advised to evacuate storm-surge-prone areas. One fatality resulted from rough seas {{off the coast}} of Panama City, Florida. Later that day, another man drowned after falling off his ship near Bay County. An EF-0 tornado <b>spawned</b> <b>by</b> the storm in Cape Coral, Florida damaged 11 homes, leaving $103,000 (2009 USD) in damages. Additional damages to coastal property and beaches amounted to $125,000 (2009 USD) as a result of Claudette.|$|E
5|$|The storm moved ashore {{just below}} {{hurricane}} strength, though wind gusts near the coast were generally around 4060mph (6595km/h). Gusts peaked at 62mph (100km/h) in Wilmington, {{and the strong}} winds downed trees and power lines across the coastal region; about 69,000people were left without power. Minor property damage was caused by three tornadoes <b>spawned</b> <b>by</b> the storm in eastern North Carolina. The passage of the storm caused a traffic fatality in the state. Overall damage was estimated at $80million (2006USD), all but $4million of which from crop damage.|$|E
50|$|For {{use as a}} model organism, {{breeding}} can now {{be done in the}} laboratory. Adults can {{be induced}} to <b>spawn</b> <b>by</b> experiencing a thermal shock and can be encouraged to spawn several times a year. Metamorphosis in the lab took place in 1 to 3 months.|$|R

40|$|Quinn {{will discuss}} how natural {{selection}} operates on {{the timing of}} migration and <b>spawning</b> <b>by</b> salmon. Temperature and flow are the primary physical factors in the evolution and ecology of timing. Salmon seem to be adapting to climate change. Artificial selection from hatcheries and from fisheries can counter or enhance natural selection, with important consequences for salmon. ...|$|R
5|$|Accompanying Hurricane Katrina's catastrophic coastal impacts was a {{moderate}} tornado outbreak <b>spawned</b> <b>by</b> the cyclone's outer bands. The event spanned August26–31, 2005, with 57tornadoes touching down across 8states. One person died and numerous communities suffered damage of varying degrees from central Mississippi to Pennsylvania, with Georgia sustaining record monetary damage {{for the month}} of August. Due to extreme devastation in coastal areas of Louisiana and Mississippi, multiple tornadoes may have been overlooked—overshadowed by the effects of storm surge and large-scale wind—and thus {{the full extent of the}} hurricane's tornado outbreak is uncertain. Furthermore, an indeterminate number of waterspouts likely formed throughout the life cycle of Katrina.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} the Florida Straits, the hurricane {{turned to the}} northeast, producing tropical storm winds along the Florida Keys. High rainfall caused flooding, while three tornadoes <b>spawned</b> <b>by</b> the storm damaged houses in the Miami area. The hurricane reached peak winds of 125mph (205km/h) on October6 while moving through the Bahamas. It subsequently weakened and became extratropical on October8. The former hurricane lashed the coast of Nova Scotia with high winds and rain, leaving about $1million (1933CAD) in damage. Rough seas sank several ships and killed nine people in the region. The remnants of the hurricane eventually dissipated on October9 {{to the south of}} Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|Almirante Latorres genesis can {{be traced}} to the {{numerous}} naval arms races between Chile and Argentina, which in turn were <b>spawned</b> <b>by</b> territorial disputes over their mutual borders in Patagonia and Puna de Atacama, along with control of the Beagle Channel. Naval races flared up in the 1890s and in 1902; the latter was eventually settled via British mediation. Provisions in the dispute-ending treaty imposed restrictions on both countries' navies. The United Kingdom's Royal Navy bought the two Constitución-class pre-dreadnought battleships that were being built for Chile, and Argentina sold its two Rivadavia-class armored cruisers under construction in Italy to Japan.|$|E

5|$|Although Wipha did not {{directly}} impact the Philippines, the outer bands of the storm produced severe flooding in Negros Occidental. The flooding washed out large areas of agricultural land worth PHP10.3million ($211,000USD). Numerous farm to market roads were also damaged or destroyed, costing PHP5million ($103,000USD). The floods also destroyed 13 homes and damaged 31 others. A rare tornado <b>spawned</b> <b>by</b> the storm destroyed four homes and damaged 19 others. A total of 7,640 families were affected by Wipha in the Philippines. The heavy rains caused a landslide which killed one person on September16. Another man drowned in a flood swollen river on September21. Three other people were listed as missing after being swept away in a river swollen by Wipha.|$|E
5|$|More than 11,000 years ago, prehistoric Native Americans lived {{along the}} Snake. Salmon from the Pacific Ocean <b>spawned</b> <b>by</b> the {{millions}} in the river. These fish were {{central to the}} lives of the people along the Snake below Shoshone Falls. By the time Lewis and Clark crossed the Rockies and sighted the valley of a Snake tributary, the Nez Perce and Shoshone were the most powerful peoples in the region. Some tribes adopted use of horses after contact with Europeans, which reshaped their hunting and cultures for the next few hundred years before outside settlement. Later explorers and fur trappers further changed and used the resources of the Snake River basin. At one point, a hand sign made by the Shoshones representing fish was misinterpreted to represent a snake, giving the Snake River its name.|$|E
