40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse the significance of a change in dividend <b>payment</b> <b>frequency.</b> We initially argue that a change in dividend <b>payment</b> <b>frequency</b> is significant and relevant in the same manner as a change in dividend policy. We analyse the subject using an event study of Sechaba Holdings, a firm listed on the Botswana Exchange` that decided to change its dividend <b>payment</b> <b>frequency</b> from quarterly to bi-annual payment to examine the subject. We specifically used an event study methodology that analyses the significance of abnormal returns that occurred during the event period. The study revealed that the firm’s decision to change its dividend <b>payment</b> <b>frequency</b> did not significantly affect abnormal returns during the event period.   The study therefore contradicted our initial argument that a change in dividend <b>payment</b> <b>frequency</b> is significant and relevant...|$|R

40|$|The joint {{contributions}} of prospect theory and mental accounting imply that investors receive a higher utility when a given level of dividends is paid more frequently, suggesting that dividends {{should be paid}} as often as possible. We document a strong positive relationship between <b>payment</b> <b>frequency</b> and firm value, confirmed with an event study of dividend <b>payment</b> <b>frequency</b> changes. Upon examining {{the frequency with which}} dividends are paid around the world, we discover that considerable variation exists, and that dividends are not paid as often as behavioral aspects suggest they should. From our multivariate analysis, we determine that non-behavioral factors such as the legal regime as well as the level and standard deviation of operating income exert significant influences on the <b>payment</b> <b>frequency</b> of dividends, suggesting that a tradeoff exists between behavioral and non-behavioral factors. The relationship between <b>payment</b> <b>frequency</b> and firm value remains robust in the presence of these non-behavioral factors.

40|$|Mortgage-prepayment risk {{underlies}} the structuring of mortgage-backed derivative securities, such as tranched real estate mortgage investment conduits. This prepayment comes either from mortgage termination or from curtailment, where the borrower retains the existing mortgage and prepays a portion. There {{are differences in}} cash flows from {{the two types of}} prepayment. In termination, the loan disappears from a pool, and the <b>scheduled</b> <b>payment</b> to investors in the pool is reduced. In curtailment, the loan survives, and the <b>scheduled</b> <b>payment</b> is unchanged but the term is reduced. There are implications for structuring mortgages and derivative securities. The prepayment decision is embedded in an in-tertemporal household utility maximization framework where choices are made between refinancing, making the regular payment, default or curtailment. Empirical results are presented for Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) pools, and an algorithm is presented that separates the termination and curtailment components, facilitating the development of derivative securities.
