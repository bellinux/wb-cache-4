Design/methodology/approach: Duplex 2205 and austenitic 316 L steels were used. Butt joints of plates 15 mm in thickness were performed with the use of submerged arc welding (SAW) method. The heat input was in the range of 1. 15 – 3. 2 kJ/mm. Various plates’ edge preparations were applied. Microstructure examinations were carried out. Mechanical properties were evaluated in tensile tests, bending tests and Charpy-V toughness tests. Susceptibility to <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>cracking</b> was determined with the use of slow strain rate tests (SSRT) performed in inert (glycerin) and aggressive (boiling 35 % MgCl 2 solution) environments. Findings: All tested joints showed acceptable mechanical properties. Metallographic examinations did not indicate the excessive ferrite contents in heat affected zones (HAZ) of the welds. It was shown that area of the lowest <b>resistance</b> to <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>cracking</b> is heat affected zone at duplex steel side of dissimilar joins. That phenomenon is connected with undesirable structure of that zone consisted of greater amounts of coarse ferrite grains and acicular austenite precipitates.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>stress</b> <b>crack</b> <b>resistance</b> of some geosynthetics, such as {{high density}} {{polyethylene}} geomembranes which are made from semi-crystalline polymers, must be properly evaluated to justify their long term performance. The newly adopted ASTM D 5397 notched constant tensile load test {{can be used to}} make a proper assessment of <b>stress</b> <b>crack</b> <b>resistance.</b> From the results of a notched constant tensile load test, a mini-mum time to reach the beginning of the brittle portion of the response curve can be es-tablished. Unfortunately, the test takes too long to generate the required data (on the order of weeks or months) for it to be considered as a quality control or conformance test. This paper presents a single point version of the notched constant tensile load test, called the single point-notched constant tensile load test. If the appropriate stress level, testing temperature and incubation medium are selected a much shorter testing time of approximately 24 hours can be achieved.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Bimodal polyethylene resins are frequently used for pipe applications. In this work, blending was used to produce polyethylenes with comparable properties, {{particularly with respect to}} processing, <b>stress</b> <b>crack</b> <b>resistance</b> and tensile properties. Suitable blend components were identified, and their performance screened used ECHIP experimental design software. Blends were characterized using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), tensile testing, <b>stress</b> <b>crack</b> <b>resistance</b> measurements, impact toughness testing, capillary rheometry and melt index measurements. GPC, DSC and melt index results reveal that the method of meltcompounding produced morphologically uniform blends, with different degrees of compatibility depending on the type and level of branching of blend components. Most of the blends produced showed higher crystallinity values compared to a reference bimodal resin. Binary high density polyethylene (HDPE) blends showed better stiffness and strength properties, whereas metallocene catalyzed linear low density polyethylene (mLLDPE) containing blends illustrated superior elongation and toughness properties compared to the reference polymer and other binary blends. The highest resistance to slow crack growth (SCG) was shown by low density polyethylene (LDPE) and mLLDPE containing blends due to their high branching content. The overall blend resistance to SCG or toughness can be enhanced with levels less than 20...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: To {{properly}} {{understand and}} assess the long-term behaviour of geosynthetic materials {{it is necessary to}} investigate the various types of possible degradation mechanims. This includes both chemical and mechanical behaviour, and sometimes even their interactions with one another. Clearly, chemical degradation of geosynthetics depends on the polymer type. For example, polyolefins are vulnerable to oxidation; polyesters are susceptible to hydrolysis; and plasticizers can leach from polyvinyl chloride. This paper describes the concept of these three types of degradation, but focuses on the oxidation of polyolefins since the majority of the geosynthetics is made from this type of polymer. The methods used to predict the lifetime of antioxidants and service life of the geosynthetic material will be illustrated. Furthermore, the influence of temperature, pressure, and ultraviolet light on the service life are also demonstrated. Finally, the current specifications targeting the longevity of different geosynthetics are presented. Regarding mechanical degradation, the paper mainly focuses upon the creep deformation of geogrids and <b>stress</b> <b>crack</b> <b>resistance</b> (SCR) of polyethylene geomembranes and geopipe. The method to assess <b>stress</b> <b>crack</b> <b>resistance</b> is described, and the microscopic mechanisms that lead to such failure are explained.

In contrast, using the J-integral in EPFM, which emphasizes the nonlinear elastic-plastic strain field at the crack-tip, revealed a short-term failure stage prior to the creep failure. In this article, a power law correlation between the fracture toughness Jc and SCG was found under a planestrain condition.
