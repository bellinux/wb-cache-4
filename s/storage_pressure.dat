40|$|The analysis/interpretation of {{wellbore}} <b>storage</b> distorted <b>pressure</b> {{transient test}} data {{remains one of}} the most significant challenges in well test analysis. Deconvolution (i. e., the "conversion" of a variable-rate distorted pressure profile into the pressure profile for an equivalent constant rate production sequence) has been in limited use as a "conversion" mechanism for the last 25 years. Unfortunately, standard deconvolution techniques require accurate measurements of flow-rate and pressure ?????? at downhole (or sandface) conditions. While accurate pressure measurements are commonplace, the measurement of sandface flowrates is rare, essentially non-existent in practice. As such, the "deconvolution" of wellbore <b>storage</b> distorted <b>pressure</b> test data is problematic. In theory, this process is possible, but in practice, without accurate measurements of flowrates, this process can not be employed. In this work we provide explicit (direct) deconvolution of wellbore <b>storage</b> distorted <b>pressure</b> test data using only those pressure data. The underlying equations associated with each deconvolution scheme are derived in the Appendices and implemented via a computational module. The value of this work is that we provide explicit tools for the analysis of wellbore <b>storage</b> distorted <b>pressure</b> data; specifically, we utilize the following techniques: * Russell method (1966) (very approximate approach), * "Beta" deconvolution (1950 s and 1980 s), * "Material Balance" deconvolution (1990 s). Each method has been validated using both synthetic data and literature field cases and each method should be considered valid for practical applications. Our primary technical contribution in this work is the adaptation of various deconvolution methods for the explicit analysis of an arbitrary set of pressure transient test data which are distorted by wellbore storage ?????? without the requirement of having measured sandface flowrates...|$|R

50|$|Saturation divers {{will live}} under {{pressure}} in the saturation system between dives.

Limited excursions may be possible without special decompression, but larger excursions may require part of the saturation system to be isolated for additional decompression, or if short, it can be done in the bell. The bell can be locked onto the saturation system, and the divers transfer from the saturation system living quarters to the bell under pressure. When the bell reaches working depth the bottom lock is opened and the divers get out and back in through it. Before surfacing the bell the lock is closed and sealed to maintain internal pressure, and the divers transfer back to the saturation system living quarters under pressure.|$|E
