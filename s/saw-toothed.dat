5|$|Although space vector {{pulse-width}} modulation (SVPWM) {{is becoming}} increasingly popular, sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) is the most straightforward method used to vary drives' motor voltage (or current) and frequency. With SPWM control (see Fig. 1), quasi-sinusoidal, variable-pulse-width output is constructed from intersections of a <b>saw-toothed</b> carrier signal with a modulating sinusoidal signal which is variable in operating frequency {{as well as in}} voltage (or current).|$|E
5|$|Banksia serrata {{was first}} {{collected}} at Botany Bay on 29 April 1770, by Sir Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, naturalists on the British vessel HMS Endeavour during Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook's first voyage to the Pacific Ocean. The species was not published until April 1782, when Carolus Linnaeus the Younger described {{the first four}} Banksia species in his Supplementum Plantarum, commenting {{that it was the}} showiest species in the genus. As the first named species of the genus, Banksia serrata is considered the type species. Banksia serrata has the common names of old man banksia, saw banksia, <b>saw-toothed</b> banksia and saw-leaved banksia. It is also known as red honeysuckle and red banksia from the colour of its timber.|$|E
5|$|The blackmouth {{catshark}} (Galeus melastomus) is {{a species of}} catshark, {{and part of the}} family Scyliorhinidae, common in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean from Iceland to Senegal, including the Mediterranean Sea. It is typically found over the continental slope at depths of , on or near muddy bottoms. The youngest sharks generally inhabit shallower water than the older juveniles and adults. This slim-bodied species is characterized by the black interior of its mouth, a marbled pattern of pale-edged brownish saddles or blotches along its back and tail, and a prominent <b>saw-toothed</b> crest of enlarged dermal denticles along the upper edge of its caudal fin. It reaches lengths of , with sharks in the Atlantic growing larger than those in the Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|Ammonitic - lobes and saddles {{are much}} {{subdivided}} (fluted); subdivisions are usually rounded instead of <b>saw-toothed.</b> Ammonoids {{of this type}} {{are the most important}} species from a biostratigraphical point of view.

25|$|AF can be {{distinguished}} from atrial flutter (AFL), which appears as an organized electrical circuit usually in the right atrium. AFL produces characteristic <b>saw-toothed</b> F-waves of constant amplitude and frequency on an ECG whereas AF does not. In AFL, the discharges circulate rapidly {{at a rate of}} 300beats per minute (bpm) around the atrium. In AF, there is no regularity of this kind, except at the sources where the local activation rate can exceed 500 bpm.|$|E
25|$|The fence was not {{continuous}} {{and could be}} crossed {{at a number of}} points other than the official border crossings. Gates were installed to enable border guards to patrol up to the border line and to give engineers maintenance access to the outward-facing side of the barrier. Like the fence itself, the gates were designed to be escape-proof. They were hinged from the outside but opened inwards and the pivot pins were welded to prevent their removal. They were chained and locked with heavy-duty padlocks, and a sharp <b>saw-toothed</b> steel strip was bolted {{to the top of the}} gates to prevent them from being climbed.|$|E
25|$|Swords: {{the most}} common swords of the era {{originated}} from southern Europe. They were one metre long, designed to cut rather than thrust, with an S-shaped crossguard. As in many medieval swords, the heavy pommel balanced the blade and {{could be used for}} striking in close combat. The other version, which became popular {{in the second half of}} the century. was of similar design except for the quillon, which was curved towards the blade for the purpose of breaking or clinching the enemy's blade. The 130–140cm long bastardswords also came into use. As a companion weapon, daggers of <b>saw-toothed</b> and flame-form type were applied (both with ring-guard) and a misericordia.|$|E
25|$|Galeus is a genus of catshark, {{belonging}} to the family Scyliorhinidae, commonly known as sawtail catsharks in reference to a distinctive <b>saw-toothed</b> crest of enlarged dermal denticles, found along the upper edges of their caudal fins. They {{are found in the}} Atlantic, the western and central Pacific, and the Gulf of California, inhabiting deep waters at or close to the sea floor. Members of this genus are rather small, slim sharks with firm bodies and thick, rough skin. Their heads are usually fairly long and pointed, and have large mouths with well-developed furrows at the corners. They have large pectoral and anal fins, and two similar dorsal fins placed well back. Many species are ornately patterned with dark saddles and/or blotches. Sawtail catsharks feed on various invertebrates and fishes, and may be either egg-laying or live-bearing. These harmless sharks are sometimes caught as bycatch but are of minimal commercial value.|$|E
25|$|The two dorsal fins {{are similar}} in size and shape, with blunt apexes. The first dorsal fin {{originates}} over {{the midpoint of the}} pelvic fin bases, while the second originates over the midpoint of the anal fin base. The pectoral fins are large and broad, with rounded corners. The pelvic and anal fins are low and angular in shape. The anal fin base is distinctively long compared to {{the other members of the}} G. arae complex, measuring 1316% of the total length. The caudal fin has a small, rounded lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The body is covered by small, overlapping dermal denticles, each with a leaf-shaped crown bearing a horizontal ridge and three marginal teeth. A series of enlarged denticles form an obvious <b>saw-toothed</b> crest along the anterior dorsal edge of the caudal fin. This species is brownish above, with a marbled pattern of darker saddles and blotches along the body and tail that become indistinct past the origin of the first dorsal fin. The underside is uniformly light, and the inside of the mouth is dark.|$|E
25|$|The apexes of two dorsal fins are blunt, {{with the}} first {{originating}} behind {{the midpoint of the}} pelvic fin bases. The second dorsal fin is almost as large as the first, and originates behind the midpoint of the anal fin base. The pectoral fins are rather large and broad, with rounded corners. The pelvic and anal fins are low and angular. The anal fin base measures roughly 814% of the total length, about comparable to the space between the dorsal fins. The caudal fin has a small lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The body is covered by tiny, overlapping dermal denticles; each has a leaf-shaped crown bearing a horizontal ridge and three marginal teeth. There is a prominent, <b>saw-toothed</b> crest formed from enlarged denticles along the anterior portion of the dorsal caudal fin edge. This species has a marbled color pattern consisting of usually fewer than 11 dark brown saddles and/or blotches along the back and tail, on a dusky background; the blotches can vary from faint to well-defined by a pale outline. Some individuals also have a distinctive dark marking with three backward-pointing prongs atop the head. The underside is plain and whitish. The inside of the mouth is dark.|$|E
25|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} has a blunt apex and is {{positioned}} over {{the latter half}} of the pelvic fin bases. The second dorsal fin is nearly as large as the first and similar in shape, and positioned over {{the latter half of}} the anal fin base. The large, broad pectoral fins have rounded corners. The pelvic and anal fins are low and angular. The anal fin base measures roughly 1014% of the total length, exceeding the distance between the pelvic and anal fins and about the same as the distance between the dorsal fins. The caudal fin is low, with a small lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping; each has a leaf-shaped crown with a horizontal ridge and three marginal teeth. There is a prominent <b>saw-toothed</b> crest, formed from enlarged denticles, along the anterior portion of the dorsal caudal fin margin. This species is yellowish brown above with a marbled color pattern consisting of usually fewer than 11 dark saddles along the back and tail. Some smaller sharks have markings that form horizontal lines, while some larger sharks have round blotches along the sides. These markings can range from faint to well-defined by white outlines. The underside is pale, and the inside of the mouth is black.|$|E
500|$|The gnarled lumpy bark, <b>saw-toothed</b> {{leaves and}} silvery-yellow spikes in bud are horticultural {{features}} of B.serrata. It {{can be grown}} readily from seed, collected after heating the [...] "cone". A sterile, free-draining seed-raising mixture prevents damping off. In cultivation, though relatively resistant to P. cinnamomi dieback, it grows best in a well drained soil, preferably fairly sandy with a pH from 5.5 to 7.5, and a sunny aspect. Summer watering aids in growth. The plant may take several years to flower, although plants grown from cuttings may flower in two years. Banksia serrata is also used in bonsai.|$|E
500|$|The {{shape of}} wings {{exhibits}} great variety in Lepidoptera. In {{the case of}} the Papilionoidea, the costa may be straight or highly arched. It is sometimes [...] on the hindwing. It is occasionally serrate or minutely <b>saw-toothed</b> on the forewing. The apex may be rounded, pointed or [...] (produced, and concave below). The termen tends to be straight or concave on the forewing while it is usually more or less convex on the hindwing. The termen is often [...] or , i.e. produced at each vein and concave in between them. The dorsum is normally straight but may be concave.|$|E
500|$|The pelvic fins {{have nearly}} {{straight}} margins and angular tips. The tail {{is long and}} whip-like, measuring some 2.5 times {{the length of the}} disc. A long, <b>saw-toothed</b> spine is placed atop the tail at around half a disc length back from the tail base; sometimes one or two replacement spines are also present in front of the existing one. Behind the spine, there is a long ventral fin fold that is much lower than that of the southern stingray. Individuals under [...] across have completely smooth skin. Larger rays develop increasing numbers of distinctive tubercles or bucklers (flat-based thorns) over the middle of the back from the snout to the tail base, as well as dorsal and lateral rows of thorns on the tail. The bucklers vary in size, with the largest of equal diameter to the eye, and may bear up to three thorns each. This species is a uniform dark brown or olive above, and off-white below without dark fin margins. Among the largest members of its family, the roughtail stingray can reach [...] across, [...] long, and [...] in weight. Females grow larger than males.|$|E

2500|$|The Springer's sawtail {{catshark}} (Galeus springeri) is {{a little-known}} species of catshark, {{belonging to the}} family Scyliorhinidae, found in waters [...] deep off the islands of the Antilles, from Cuba to the Leewards. A small, slim-bodied species reaching a length of , the Springer's sawtail catshark can be identified by its color pattern of horizontal dark stripes {{in front of the}} first dorsal fin, and dark dorsal saddles behind. It is additionally characterized by the presence of <b>saw-toothed</b> crests, made of enlarged dermal denticles along both the dorsal and the ventral edges of the caudal fin. The Springer's sawtail catshark is oviparous. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks the information to assess its conservation status.|$|E

60|$|And {{far below}} him fleets the mighty Rhine, rich with the {{memories}} of two thousand stormy years; and on its further bank the grey-walled Coblentz town, and the long arches of the Moselle-bridge, and the rich flats of Kaiser Franz, and the long poplar-crested uplands, which look so gay, and are so stern; for everywhere between the poplar-stems the <b>saw-toothed</b> outline of the western forts cuts the blue sky.|$|E
60|$|The {{blunt end}} of the Funeral Range was as {{remarkable}} as its name. It sheered up very high, a <b>saw-toothed</b> range with colored strata tilted at an angle of forty-five degrees. Zigzag veins of black and red and yellow, rather dull, ran through the great drab-gray mass. This {{end of the}} range, an iron mountain, frowned down upon us with hard and formidable aspect. The peak was draped in streaky veils of rain from low-dropping clouds that appeared to have lodged there. All below lay clear and cold in the sunlight.|$|E
60|$|Look {{across the}} world beyond that curtain of thick darkness. Behold! A vast city of fantastic houses half buried in winter snows and reddened by the lurid sunset {{breaking}} through a <b>saw-toothed</b> canopy of cloud. Everywhere upon the temple squares and open spaces great fires burning a strange fuel--the bodies of thousands of mankind. Pestilence was king of that city, a pestilence hitherto unknown. Innumerable hordes had died and were dying, yet innumerable hordes remained. All the patient East bore forth those still shapes that had been theirs to love or hate, and, their task done, turned to {{the banks of the}} mighty river and watched.|$|E
60|$|The harbour of Fuatino opened before him. It was a {{circular}} sheet of water, five miles in diameter, rimmed with white coral beaches, {{from which the}} verdure-clad slopes rose swiftly to the frowning crater walls. The crests of the walls were <b>saw-toothed,</b> volcanic peaks, capped and halo'd with captive trade-wind clouds. Every nook and crevice of the disintegrating lava gave foothold to creeping, climbing vines and trees--a green foam of vegetation. Thin streams of water, that were mere films of mist, swayed and undulated downward in sheer descents of hundreds of feet. And to complete {{the magic of the}} place, the warm, moist air was heavy with the perfume of the yellow-blossomed cassi.|$|E
60|$|It was a view which, when once seen, {{must always}} haunt the mind. Such {{an expanse of}} savage and unrelieved desert might be part of some cold and burned-out planet rather than of this fertile and {{bountiful}} earth. Away and away it stretched to die into a soft, violet haze in the extremest distance. In the foreground the sand was of a bright golden yellow, which was quite dazzling in the sunshine. Here and there in a scattered cordon stood the six trusty negro soldiers leaning motionless upon their rifles, and each throwing a shadow which looked as solid as himself. But beyond this golden plain lay a low line of those black slag-heaps, with yellow sand-valleys winding between them. These in their turn were topped by higher and more fantastic hills, and these by others, peeping over each other's shoulders until they blended with that distant violet haze. None of these hills were of any height,--a few hundred feet at the most,--but their savage, <b>saw-toothed</b> crests and their steep scarps of sun-baked stone gave them a fierce character of their own.|$|E
60|$|She {{might have}} been {{prepared}} for what she saw from the ridge-top. Beneath them the desert blazed. Seen from afar, it was striking enough, but riding down into its red jaws gave Madeline the first affront to her imperious confidence. All about her ranch had been desert, the valleys were desert; but this was different. Here began the red desert, extending far into Mexico, far across Arizona and California to the Pacific. She saw a bare, hummocky ridge, down which the car was gliding, bounding, swinging, and this long slant seemed to merge into a corrugated world of rock and sand, patched by flats and basins, streaked with canyons and ranges of ragged, <b>saw-toothed</b> stone. The distant Sierra Madres were clearer, bluer, less smoky and suggestive of mirage {{than she had ever}} seen them. Madeline's sustaining faith upheld her {{in the face of this}} appalling obstacle. Then the desert that had rolled its immensity beneath her gradually began to rise, to lose its distant margins, to condense its varying lights and shades, at last to hide its yawning depths and looming heights behind red ridges, which were only little steps, little outposts, little landmarks at its gates.|$|E
60|$|We had a {{lunch of}} jerked beef and hard poi in a stone corral, used of old {{time for the}} night-impounding of cattle being driven across the island. Then we skirted the rim for half a mile and began the descent into the crater. Twenty-five hundred feet beneath lay the floor, and down a steep slope of loose {{volcanic}} cinders we dropped, the sure-footed horses slipping and sliding, but always keeping their feet. The black surface of the cinders, when broken by the horses' hoofs, turned to a yellow ochre dust, virulent in appearance and acid of taste, that arose in clouds. There was a gallop across a level stretch {{to the mouth of}} a convenient blow-hole, and then the descent continued in clouds of volcanic dust, winding in and out among cinder-cones, brick-red, old rose, and purplish black of colour. Above us, higher and higher, towered the crater-walls, while we journeyed on across innumerable lava-flows, turning and twisting a devious way among the adamantine billows of a petrified sea. <b>Saw-toothed</b> waves of lava vexed the surface of this weird ocean, while on either hand arose jagged crests and spiracles of fantastic shape. Our way led on past a bottomless pit and along and over the main stream of the latest lava-flow for seven miles.|$|E
60|$|The notable {{parts of}} the suite were the swordbearers and the band. The former carried five afõa, {{peculiar}} weapons, emblems of royalty. The blades are licked when swearing; they are despatched with messengers as a hint to enforce obedience; and they are held, after a fashion, to be holy. I have never seen more conventional, distorted, and useless weapons. Three blades showed the usual chopping-bill shape, pierced, like fish-slicers, with round, semicircular, and angular holes. One, measuring twenty-three inches and three-quarters, was leaf-formed, dotted with a lozenge-pattern and set with copper studs. Another was partially <b>saw-toothed.</b> All were of iron, rusty with the rust of years and hardly sharp enough to cut a pat of butter. The impossible handles were worthy of the blades, bulging grips between two huge balls utterly unfitted for handling; four were covered with thin gold-plate in repoussé work, and one with silver. The metal was sewn together with thin wire, and the joints had been hammered to hide them. Cameron sketched them for my coming 'Book of the Sword;' and Ahin Blay kept his promise by sending me a specimen of the weapon with two divergent blades used to cut off noses and ears. Bowdich [Footnote: Mission, &c., p. 312] mentions finely-worked double blades springing parallel from a single handle; here nothing was known about them.|$|E
60|$|Smoke {{spent the}} morning in camp, sewing dog-moccasins and {{repairing}} harnesses. At noon he cooked a meal for two, ate his share, and began to look for Shorty's return. An hour later he strapped on his snow-shoes and went out on his partner's trail. The way led up {{the bed of the}} stream, through a narrow gorge that widened suddenly into a moose-pasture. But no moose had been there since the first snow of the preceding fall. The tracks of Shorty's snow-shoes crossed the pasture and went up the easy slope of a low divide. At the crest Smoke halted. The tracks continued down the other slope. The first spruce-trees, in the creek bed, were a mile away, and it was evident that Shorty had passed through them and gone on. Smoke looked at his watch, remembered the oncoming darkness, the dogs, and the camp, and reluctantly decided against going farther. But before he retraced his steps he paused for a long look. All the eastern sky-line was <b>saw-toothed</b> by the snowy backbone of the Rockies. The whole mountain system, range upon range, seemed to trend to the northwest, cutting athwart the course to the open country reported by La Perle. The effect was as if the mountains conspired to thrust back the traveler toward the west and the Yukon. Smoke wondered how many men in the past, approaching as he had approached, had been turned aside by that forbidding aspect. La Perle had not been turned aside, but, then, La Perle had crossed over from the eastern slope of the Rockies.|$|E
6000|$|They started {{next morning}} cheerfully enough, and {{for three hours}} or more paddled easily up the glassy and windless reaches, between two green flower-bespangled walls of forest, gay with innumerable birds and insects; while down from the {{branches}} which overhung the stream long trailers hung to the water's edge, and seemed admiring in the clear mirror the images of their own gorgeous flowers. River, trees, flowers, birds, insects,--it was all a fairy-land: {{but it was a}} colossal one; and yet the voyagers took little note of it. It was now to them an everyday occurrence, to see trees full two hundred feet high one mass of yellow or purple blossom to the highest twigs, and every branch and stem one hanging garden of crimson and orange orchids or vanillas. Common to them were all the fantastic and enormous shapes with which Nature bedecks her robes beneath the fierce suns and fattening rains of the tropic forest. Common were forms and colors of bird, and fish, and butterfly, more strange and bright than ever opium-eater dreamed. The long processions of monkeys, who kept pace with them along the tree-tops, and proclaimed their wonder in every imaginable whistle, and grunt, and howl, had ceased to move their laughter, as much as the roar of the jaguar and the rustle of the boa had ceased to move their fear; and when a brilliant green and rose-colored fish, flat-bodied like a bream, flab-finned like a salmon, and <b>saw-toothed</b> like a shark, leapt clean on board of the canoe to escape the rush of the huge alligator (whose loathsome snout, ere he could stop, actually rattled against the canoe within a foot of Jack Brimblecombe's hand), Jack, instead of turning pale, as he had done at the sharks upon a certain memorable occasion, coolly picked up the fish, and said, [...] "He's four pound weight!
