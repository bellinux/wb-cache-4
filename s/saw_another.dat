The national team joined the tournaments such as the Pestabola Merdeka, Pesta Sukan, Jakarta Anniversary Tournamentp and the President Park Tournament. The Philippines managed to cause upsets results against Thailand, Singapore and South Korea. When the Spanish players, Tomas Lozano, Mannuel Cuenca, Juan Guitierrez and Julio Roxas left the football team due to financial reasons, football in the country <b>saw</b> <b>another</b> decline and basketball gained foothold in the country.|$|E
5|$|In September 1939, New York {{joined the}} Neutrality Patrol, {{safeguarding}} sea lanes in the North Atlantic, {{and served as}} flagship with the Atlantic Squadron, later redesignated the United States Atlantic Fleet, for the next 27 months. In July 1941, she protected a convoy of U.S. troops moving to garrison Iceland. She <b>saw</b> <b>another</b> modernization in 1940–41 where her main battery elevation was increased from 15 to 30 degrees. She {{was in the midst}} of this refit on 7 December 1941, when the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor, sinking many of the battleships in the U.S. Pacific Fleet and bringing the United States into World War II.|$|E

5|$|After a drawn first Test {{the second}} match {{was a game}} of two halves. England {{developed}} a 233 run lead at the half way stage and had the West Indies on 204/5 when Butcher was caught. This dismissal caused a riot and from this point onwards England struggled with the spin bowling of Sobers and Gibbs, narrowly avoiding defeat by two wickets. The third Test <b>saw</b> <b>another</b> drawn match due to the slow batting of the West Indies, taking over two days to score 349 runs which included a spell of four runs in one hour. England took a 1–0 lead after the fourth Test, {{in a game that}} they seemed least like winning. The win was mainly due to Sobers' decision to declare on 92/2 in the West Indies second innings. Good batting by Alan Knott and a 127 sixth wicket partnership ensured the final game ended in a draw as England maintained their 1–0 lead to win the series.|$|E
5|$|Despite this {{emerging}} competition, natural ice remained vital to North American and European economies, with demand driven up by rising living standards. The huge demand for {{ice in the}} 1880s drove the natural ice trade to continue to expand. Around four million tons (four billion kg) of ice was routinely stored along the Hudson River and Maine alone, the Hudson having around 135 major warehouses along its banks and employing 20,000 workers. Firms expanded along the Kennebec River in Maine to meet the demand, and 1,735 vessels were required in 1880 to carry the ice south. Lakes in Wisconsin began {{to be put into}} production to supply the Midwest. 1890 <b>saw</b> <b>another</b> ice famine hit the east: the Hudson harvests failed entirely, causing a sudden rush by entrepreneurs to establish operations in Maine, where ice had successfully formed. Unfortunately for investors, the following summer was quite cool, suppressing demand for stocks and many businessmen were ruined. Across the U.S., an estimated 90,000 people and 25,000 horses involved in a trade capitalised at $28 million ($660 million in 2010 terms).|$|E
5|$|In 1030, the Rus' {{raided the}} region of Shirvan; the ruler of Ganja then paid them much money to help {{suppress}} a revolt in Beylagan. Afterwards, the Rus' returned home. According to one source, in November 1031 the Rus' returned, but were defeated near Baku and expelled. The year of 1032 <b>saw</b> <b>another</b> Rus' raid into Shirvan; {{they were joined by}} the Alans and Sarir. Local Muslims defeated the Rus' in 1033. It is unclear to which Rus' grouping these raiders belonged. Omeljan Pritsak suggests that they operated out of a base near the Terek estuary and had their principal home in Tmutarakan. Pritsak also speculated that the Rus', operating from the Caspian basin, shortly thereafter lent support to the Oghuz in a power struggle in Khwarezm.|$|E

5|$|The 2007–08 {{campaign}} <b>saw</b> <b>another</b> first-round playoffs exit for Nowitzki and his Mavericks. Despite a mid-season {{trade that}} sent veteran NBA All-Star Jason Kidd to Dallas, the Mavericks finished seventh {{in a highly}} competitive Western Conference. Nowitzki averaged 23.6 points, 8.6 rebounds, and a career-high 3.5 assists for the season. In the playoffs, they faced rising star Chris Paul's New Orleans Hornets, and were eliminated in five games. The playoff loss led to the firing of Avery Johnson as head coach and the eventual hiring of Rick Carlisle. The few positive highlights that season for Nowitzki were his first career triple-double against the Milwaukee Bucks on February 6, 2008, with 29 points, 10 rebounds, and a career-high 12 assists, and on March 8, 2008 (34 points against the New Jersey Nets), when he surpassed Rolando Blackman with his 16,644th point to become the Mavericks' all-time career points leader.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson wrote Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in 1885 when he {{was living}} in Bournemouth, on England's south coast. In January 1886 the novella was {{published}} in the United Kingdom by Longmans, Green & Co. and by Charles Scribner's Sons in the United States, where it was frequently pirated {{because of the lack of}} copyright protection in the U.S. for works originally published in the UK. In early 1887, actor Richard Mansfield read Stevenson's novella and immediately got the idea to adapt it for the stage. Mansfield was looking for material that would help him achieve a reputation as a serious actor in the U.S., where he lived, and in England, where he had spent most of his childhood. He had played dual roles as a father and son in a New York production of the operetta Rip Van Winkle, and <b>saw</b> <b>another</b> acting opportunity in playing Jekyll and Hyde.|$|E
5|$|The seventh season <b>saw</b> <b>another</b> format change, as fighters had {{to compete}} to be {{official}} castmembers. Instead {{of the usual}} 16 fighters, the season had 32 fighters after Dana White claimed that {{he was tired of}} fighters coming onto the show for airtime. This season was coached by UFC Light Heavyweight champion Quinton Jackson and challenger Forrest Griffin, the first season's winner. The season's final was due to be competed between Amir Sadollah, who hadn't competed in a professional fight before the show, and Jesse Taylor. However, Taylor was kicked off the show after filming had completed, when he kicked the window out of a limosine in Las Vegas. His slot was taken by C.B. Dollaway who defeated Tim Credeur for the right, but Sadollah won in the final to become The Ultimate Fighter.|$|E

5|$|The tournament to crown {{the inaugural}} CMLL World Heavyweight Champion ran from May 24 to June 9, 1991, and {{featured}} 16 competitors. The {{first round of}} the tournament saw two eight-man battle royals, each ending when four wrestlers were left in the ring. This was used to cut the field in half with the last four remaining wrestlers from each match advancing to the next round. Konnan, Rayo de Jalisco Jr., Black Magic, and Mascara Ano 2000 advanced in the first battle royal, while Brazo de Plata, Vampiro Canadiense, Universo 2000, and El Egipcio were eliminated. In the second battle royal, Nitron, Pierroth Jr., Pirata Morgan, and Cien Caras advanced while Fabulous Blondie, Gran Markus Jr., Máscara Sagrada, and El Egipcio were eliminated. The second round <b>saw</b> <b>another</b> pair of battle royals with four men in each, ending when two wrestlers were left in the ring. This narrowed the tournament down to the final four wrestlers, who faced off in traditional semi-finals matches, before the final match to crown the inaugural champion.|$|E

Smooth continued to increase its audience share in the second quarter of 2011, with an average weekly total of 3.2 million, which rose once again in the third quarter to 3.328 million, meaning that for the first time Smooth's figures overtook those of one of its national rivals, talkSPORT. The station had an audience of 3.3 million in {{the final quarter}} of 2011, making it the second most listened to national commercial radio station in the UK. 3,317,000 listeners were tuning in during the first quarter of 2012, which dropped slightly in the second quarter to 3.2 million. The third quarter of 2012 <b>saw</b> <b>another</b> small drop to 3.19 million, but in the same period Smooth 70s recorded its first audience figures of 749,000. Collectively 3.7 million listeners were tuning into Smooth-branded stations. That figure rose to 3.8 million in the final quarter of the year. The first quarter of 2013 saw an average weekly audience of 3.6 million, which fell to 3.1 million for the second quarter. However, figures rose again through the second half of the year, with 3.26 million in the third quarter of 2013, and 3.38 million in the fourth.|$|E
5|$|German Bundesliga team VfB Stuttgart were Celtic's fourth round {{opponents in}} the Spring of 2003. Celtic came from behind to win the first leg 3–1 at Parkhead, while in the second leg, despite Celtic going up 2–0 early, a {{comeback}} from Stuttgart saw the Bundesliga side win 3–2 on the night, although Celtic would progress 5–4 on aggregate. The quarter-finals <b>saw</b> <b>another</b> English Premier League opponent for Celtic, this time Liverpool. The first leg took place at Celtic Park on 13 March 2003, ending 1–1 through a first-minute Larsson goal; the away goal, however, gave Liverpool an advantage entering their home tie at Anfield. In the first leg, Liverpool player El Hadji Diouf spat at a Celtic supporter, and was later fined £5,000 at Glasgow's Sheriff Court for the incident. The return match at Anfield took place the following week. Two minutes from half-time, Celtic were awarded a free-kick 25 yards from goal. Alan Thompson struck a low shot past Jerzy Dudek from the set piece, with the ball going under the defensive wall which had jumped up and appeared to distract the Liverpool goalkeeper. Celtic sealed a 20 victory on 82 minutes when John Hartson played a one-two with Larsson, then drove a swerving shot from 25 yards out into the top-right corner of Dudek's goal.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, the club's home {{moved from}} the Antônio Carlos to the newer and larger Estádio Independência. The season <b>saw</b> <b>another</b> Campeonato Mineiro triumph and the club's first European tour, in which it played ten games in five countries. The {{excursion}} happened {{at a time when}} there were neither regular national competitions in Brazil nor continental ones in South America, and followed soon after the traumatic Maracanazo. The tour and Atlético's results, many of which achieved under adverse weather conditions and snow, were seen by national sports media as a historic achievement for Brazilian football itself. The team, captained by Zé do Monte, was dubbed the Campeões do Gelo ("Ice Champions"), a title that is remembered in the club's official anthem. The club's success in the state competition continued in the 1950s, a decade that saw the rise of forward Ubaldo and five consecutive Campeonato Mineiro victories from 1952 to 1956. After another state league title in 1958, Atlético took part in the inaugural edition of the Taça Brasil in the following year, reaching the third round. The tournament, the country's first annual nationwide competition, was a cup contested between state league champions, originally created by the CBD to select Brazil's entrants in the newly formed Copa Libertadores.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{the team}} ended their {{association}} with Radical, and replaced the SR9 with a LM P2 class Ginetta-Zytek GZ09S/2; Tim Greaves, Karim Ojjeh and Thor-Christian Ebbesvik were named as the team's regular drivers, resulting in the team being known as Team Bruichladdich. The team's first race with the car came at the LMS opener, the 8 Hours of Castellet, and they finished twelfth overall, fifth in class. The 1000km of Spa proved to be less successful; the team suffered a blown engine during qualifying, and Ebbesvik crashed {{out of the race}} after 15 laps. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Gary Chalandon replaced Ebbesvik, and the team finished tenth overall, fifth in the LM P2 class. Next up was the 1000km of Algarve, and Ebbesvik returned to the team; fifth overall, and second in class, for their first class podium of the season. The 1000 km of Hungaroring <b>saw</b> <b>another</b> fifth place overall, although mechanical difficulties with the LM P1-class cars meant that this also equated to fifth in class. The season finale, which was the 1000km of Silverstone, saw the team end the season with a 19th overall, and eighth in class. The team finished the season ranked fifth in the LMP2 Team's Championship, with 46 points.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Mercedes confirmed their good form from pre-season testing and topped the time sheets by a considerable margin {{in the first}} two practice sessions on Friday, with Nico Rosberg fastest in both outings. Valtteri Bottas in the Williams was third fastest on Friday morning, some 1.2 seconds down on Rosberg's time. Ferrari's new signing Sebastian Vettel was third on Friday afternoon, seven-tenths of a second down on Rosberg. Toro Rosso showed promising times, outperforming their sister team Red Bull in the first session. Only 16 cars participated on Friday morning. Sauber kept to the garage due to their legal troubles while Manor Marussia was unable to get their cars running all weekend. The Saubers did go out for the second session, while local favourite Daniel Ricciardo and Felipe Massa missed the session due to problems with their cars. McLaren's problems continued as both cars were limited to very few laps. The first session also <b>saw</b> <b>another</b> evaluation run of the new Virtual Safety Car system.|$|E
