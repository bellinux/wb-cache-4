The National Health Service is implementing a recovery approach {{in at least some}} regions, and has developed a new professional role of Support Time and Recovery Worker. Centre for Mental Health issued a 2008 policy paper proposing that the recovery approach is an idea [...] "whose time has come" [...] and, in partnership with the NHS Confederation Mental Health Network, and support and funding from the Department of Health, manages the Implementing Recovery through Organisational Change (ImROC) nationwide project that aims to put recovery at the heart of mental health services in the UK. [...] The Scottish Executive has included the promotion and support of recovery as one of its four key mental health aims and funded a Scottish Recovery Network to facilitate this. A 2006 review of nursing in Scotland recommended a recovery approach as the model for mental health nursing care and intervention. The Mental Health Commission of Ireland reports that its guiding documents place the <b>service</b> <b>user</b> at the core and emphasize an individual's personal journey towards recovery.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a belief}} that <b>service</b> <b>users</b> have an {{essential}} {{role to play in}} collaborative care. Surprisingly, there appear to be minimal opportunities for <b>service</b> <b>user’s</b> opinions, experiences and requirements to be heard when organising the plan of care. This lack of inclusion is significant in an increasingly consumer-conscious health care context, where <b>service</b> <b>users</b> expect to have a voice about their care. The aim of this research was to explore <b>service</b> <b>user's</b> experiences, expectations and understanding of the care received at an Integrated Health Clinic. The design was qualitative descriptive. Fifteen <b>service</b> <b>users</b> were interviewed. Data were analysed thematically. The major themes identified from the <b>service</b> <b>user’s</b> that influenced <b>service</b> delivery were: <b>User</b> Expectations, User Perceptions and User Observations. Findings indicate that while <b>service</b> <b>users</b> did not receive collaborative care at the Clinic, unequivocally, they would have liked to be recipients of that model of care. However, <b>service</b> <b>users</b> spoke highly of receiving patient-centred care, of uni-professional communication, and noted that teamwork occurred in some professional groups. It was especially interesting to note that <b>service</b> <b>users</b> continued to attend the Clinic, so that they might contribute to student’s learning. In becoming involved with students they engaged in two-way learning. It seems that <b>service</b> <b>users</b> not only benefit from these practice learning situations, but contribute to the collaboration as well. This suggests that the <b>service</b> <b>user's</b> view is a critical aspect for the ongoing development of service delivery and practice in this integrated healthcare environment. Recommendations include: Developing learning packages for <b>service</b> <b>users</b> to support student learning; marketing of the Clinic; clarifying the model of care is important; the Clinic’s common purpose needs to be reviewed; interprofessional faculty development could be strengthened; and increasing Clinic availability to <b>service</b> <b>users</b> right across the year needs to be considered. Overall, <b>service</b> <b>users</b> have much to contribute to collaborative practice, and it seems that their input so far might be very much under-estimated...|$|R

We aimed to develop a standard operating procedure (SOP) to support {{researchers to}} involve <b>service</b> <b>users</b> in trials and rigorous studies. Methods:- Researchers with experience of involving <b>service</b> <b>users</b> and <b>service</b> <b>users</b> who were contributing to trials collaborated with the West Wales Organisation for Rigorous Trials in Health, a registered clinical trials unit, to develop the SOP.

Nearly 1 in 2 <b>service</b> <b>users</b> used community support services The most common service group used was community support (45 %), followed by employment (44 %), community access (17 %), accommodation support (13 %) and respite (11 %). Almost 3 in 4 <b>service</b> <b>users</b> were aged under 50 Around three-quarters (73 %) of <b>service</b> <b>users</b> were aged under 50, {{with an average}} age of 35. Most <b>service</b> <b>users</b> were male (59 %) and they were generally younger, {{with an average age}} of 32. Six per cent of <b>service</b> <b>users</b> were aged 65 and over. Over 2 in 5 <b>service</b> <b>users</b> had an intellectual or learning disability Many <b>service</b> <b>users</b> had an intellectual or learning disability (44 %), 41 % had a physical or diverse disability, 29 % had a psychiatric disability and 18 % had a sensory or speech disability. Nearly 1 in 3 <b>service</b> <b>users</b> were not in the labour force Close to one-third (30 %) of <b>service</b> <b>users</b> aged 15 and over were not in the labour force. Of those in the labour force, over two-thirds  (67 %) were unemployed. Indigenous <b>service</b> <b>users</b> aged 15 and over who were in the labour force {{were less likely to be}} employed (22 %) than their non-Indigenous counterparts (33 %). Almost 2 in 3 <b>service</b> <b>users</b> had an informal carer Around 2 in 3 <b>service</b> <b>users</b> (65 %) had an informal carer, most often their mother (72 %). Over 1 in 10 <b>service</b> <b>users</b> (12 %) had an informal carer who was aged 65 or over.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{the drive}} to engage <b>service</b> <b>users</b> in <b>service</b> delivery, {{research}} and education has mainstream acceptance, {{it is not easy}} to achieve meaningful involvement. The contribution that could potentially be made by <b>users</b> whilst accessing <b>services</b> is often overlooked. OBJECTIVES AND PARTICIPANTS: This study involved stakeholders (mentors, <b>service</b> <b>users</b> and a lecturer) working together to design, evaluate and refine a system enabling students to seek feedback from <b>service</b> <b>users.</b> The feedback concerned mental health students' interpersonal skills and occurred whilst on practice placement. This research aimed to explore the experiences of those concerned when nine students attempted to learn from rather than about <b>service</b> <b>users.</b> DESIGN: A 2 -year study, encompassing five cycles of participatory action research (PAR). SETTING: A small island community in the British Isles, adopting UK standards for pre-registration nurse education. METHODS: Data came from interviews with <b>service</b> <b>users</b> and mentors and a series of reflective group discussions with students who volunteered to try out the feedback mechanism. The deliberations of the PAR stakeholder group informed the research cycles and added to the data, which were subject to thematic analysis. FINDINGS: Findings indicated that <b>service</b> <b>users</b> volunteering to give feedback had unanimously positive experiences. Students' experience lay on a continuum: those with a stronger sense of self were more willing and able to ask for feedback than less confident students. Cultural adjustment to the role change needed was challenging, requiring self-awareness and courage. Over time, all students achieved deep learning and, for some, learning appeared transformative. CONCLUSION: Although contextual, the study concluded that the feedback initiative encouraged the development of more equitable relationships, in which mental health nurses respected the expertise of <b>service</b> <b>users.</b> This potentially benefits student development, recovery-orientated practice, <b>service</b> <b>users</b> and HEIs searching for meaningful ways to involve <b>service</b> <b>users</b> in learning and formative assessment<br/...|$|R

Method: <b>Service</b> <b>users</b> recently discharged from an inpatient unit were asked what they need when in crisis, what they found helpful and unhelpful about hospitalization, and what alternatives they recommend for crisis support. Findings were used to amend a proposal for a residential crisis service on which feedback was sought from <b>service</b> <b>users</b> and providers. Results: Thematic analysis of data from questionnaires (n = 78) and interviews (n = 10) revealed themes centred around 'Being There', 'Being With', 'How Treated', 'Staff/Systems', 'Holistic Approach', and 'Medication'. Ninety-three percent of <b>service</b> <b>users</b> and providers supported the idea of residential crisis services. Approximately 85 % supported the proposal from this study.
