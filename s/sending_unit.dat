50|$|While most {{tanks are}} manufactured, some fuel tanks are still {{fabricated}} by metal craftsmen or hand-made {{in the case}} of bladder-style tanks. These include custom and restoration tanks for automotive,aircraft, motorcycles, and even tractors. Construction of fuel tanks follows a series of specific steps. The craftsman generally creates a mockup to determine the accurate size and shape of the tank, usually out of foam board. Next, design issues that affect the structure of the tank areaddressed - such as where the outlet, drain, fluid level indicator, seams, and baffles go. Then the craftsmen must determine the thickness, temper and alloy of the sheet he will use to make the tank. After the sheet is cut to the shapes needed, various pieces are bent to create the basic shell and/or ends and baffles for the tank. Many fuel tanks' baffles (particularly in aircraft and racecars) contain lightening holes. These flanged holes serve two purposes, they reduce the weight of the tank while adding strength to the baffles. Toward the end of construction, openings are added for the filler neck, fuel pickup, drain, and fuel-level <b>sending</b> <b>unit.</b> Sometimes these holes are created on the flat shell, other times they are added {{at the end of the}} fabrication process. Baffles and ends can be riveted into place. The heads of the rivets are frequently brazed or soldered to prevent tank leaks. Ends can then be hemmed in and soldered, or flanged and brazed (and/or sealed with an epoxy-type sealant) or the ends can be flanged and then welded. Once the soldering, brazing or welding is complete, the fuel tank is leak-tested.|$|E

40|$|Helicopter EMS (HEMS) {{allows for}} {{patients}} to be quickly transported into regional cardiac centers, often to receive primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Since PCI is a time-critical therapy, {{it is important}} that patients get to primary PCI as quickly as possible. HEMS crews ’ “on-scene ” times for trauma patients have been extensively stud-ied, and recent years have seen many efforts to minimize the time required to prepare patients for transport. There has been less attention to interfacility transport “scene times ” for HEMS crews at referring hospitals; this includes stabiliza-tion times for preparing cardiac patients for loading onto aircraft for HEMS transport to primary PCI. In the absence of guiding evidence, system benchmarking and quality improvement are difficult. Therefore the current study was under-taken, to assess and describe the HEMS crew “on-scene ” times or “patient stabilization times ” (PSTs) at referring hos-pitals, for interfacility transported cardiac patients flown for primary PCI. Descriptive analysis identified a PST median of 19 minutes (interquartile range 15 - 24), and univariate analyses using Kruskal-Wallis testing found no association between prolonged PST and <b>sending</b> <b>unit</b> type (Emergency Department versus other), off-hours transports, or relatively frequent (at least monthly) use of HEMS (p for all comparisons> 0. 64).

40|$|Pulse-coupled {{threshold}} units {{serve as}} paradigmatic models {{for a wide}} range of complex systems. When the state variable of a unit crosses a threshold, the unit sends a pulse that is received by other units, thereby mediating the interactions. At the same time, the state variable of the <b>sending</b> <b>unit</b> is reset. Here we present and analyze a class of pulse-coupled oscillators where the reset may be partial only and is mediated by a partial reset function. Such a partial reset characterizes intrinsic physical or biophysical features of a unit, e. g., resistive coupling between dendrite and soma of compartmental neurons; at the same time the description in terms of a partial reset enables a rigorous mathematical investigation of the collective network dynamics. The partial reset acts as a desynchronization mechanism. For $N$ all-to-all pulse-coupled oscillators an increase in the strength of the partial reset causes a sequence of desynchronizing bifurcations from the fully synchronous state via states with large clusters of synchronized units through states with smaller clusters to complete asynchrony. By considering inter- and intracluster stability we derive sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence and stability of cluster states on the partial reset function and on the intrinsic dynamics of the oscillators. For a specific class of oscillators we obtain a rigorous derivation of all $N- 1 $ bifurcation points and demonstrate that already arbitrarily small changes in the reset function may produce the entire sequence of bifurcations. We illustrate that the transition is robust against structural perturbations and prevails in the presence of heterogeneous network connectivity and changes in the intrinsic oscillator dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) This thesis proposes an {{automated}} grid-based alignment system utilizing lasers {{and an array}} of light-detecting photodiodes. The intent is to create an inexpensive and scalable alignment system for pick-and-place robotic systems. The system utilizes the transformation matrix, geometry, and trigonometry to determine the movements to align the robot with a grid-based array of photodiodes. The alignment system consists of a <b>sending</b> <b>unit</b> utilizing lasers, a receiving module consisting of photodiodes, a data acquisition unit, a computer-based control system, and the robot being aligned. The control system computes the robot movements needed to position the lasers based on the laser positions detected by the photodiodes. A transformation matrix converts movements from the coordinate system of the grid formed by the photodiodes to the coordinate system of the robot. The photodiode grid can detect a single laser spot and move it to any part of the grid, or it can detect up to four laser spots and use their relative positions to determine rotational misalignment of the robot. Testing the alignment consists of detecting the position of a single laser at individual points in a distinct pattern on the grid array of photodiodes, and running the entire alignment process multiple times starting with different misalignment cases. The first test provides a measure of the position detection accuracy of the system, while the second test demonstrates the alignment accuracy and repeatability of the system. The system detects the position of a single laser or multiple lasers by using a method similar to a center-of-gravity calculation. The intensity of each photodiode is multiplied by the X-position of that photodiode. The summed result from each photodiode intensity and position product is divided by the summed value of all of the photodiode intensities to get the X-position of the laser. The same thing is done with the Y-values to get the Y-position of the laser. Results show that with this method the system can read a single laser position value with a resolution of 0. 1 mm, and with a maximum X-error of 2. 9 mm and Y-error of 2. 0 mm. It takes approximately 1. 5 seconds to process the reading. The alignment procedure calculates the initial misalignment between the robot and the grid of photodiodes by moving the robot to two distinct points along the robot’s X-axis so that only one laser is over the grid. Using these two detected points, a movement trajectory is generated to move that laser to the X = 0, Y = 0 position on the grid. In the process, this moves the other three lasers over the grid, allowing the system to detect the positions of four lasers and uses the positions to determine the rotational and translational offset needed to align the lasers to the grid of photodiodes. This step is run in a feedback loop to update the adjustment until it is within a permissible error value. The desired result for the complete alignment is a robot manipulator positioning within ± 0. 5 mm along the X and Y-axes. The system shows a maximum error of 0. 2 mm in the X-direction and 0. 5 mm in the Y-direction with a run-time of approximately 4 to 5 minutes per alignment. If the permissible error value of the final alignment is tripled the alignment time goes down to 1 to 1. 5 minutes and the maximum error goes up to 1. 4 mm in both the X and Y-directions. The run time of the alignment decreases because the system runs fewer alignment iterations...|$|E
