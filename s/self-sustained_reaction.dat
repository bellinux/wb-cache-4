25|$|Furthermore, {{the main}} line of {{research}} via tokamaks has been developed {{to the point that}} it is now possible to undertake the penultimate step in magnetic confinement plasma physics research with a <b>self-sustained</b> <b>reaction.</b> In the tokamak research program, recent advances devoted to controlling the configuration of the plasma have led to the achievement of substantially improved energy and pressure confinement, which reduces the projected cost of electricity from such reactors by a factor of two to a value only about 50% more than the projected cost of electricity from advanced light-water reactors. In addition, progress in the development of advanced, low activation structural materials supports the promise of environmentally benign fusion reactors and research into alternate confinement concepts is yielding the promise of future improvements in confinement. Finally, supporters contend that other potential replacements to the fossil fuels have environmental issues of their own. Solar, wind, and hydroelectric power all have a relatively low power output per square kilometer compared to ITER's successor DEMO which, at 2,000 MW, would have an energy density that exceeds even large fission power stations.|$|E

Powders of two Vanadium-spinel composites, 20 / 80 vol. %, were prepared by (a) ball milling mixtures of vanadium and spinel powders (alloy VSLP) and (b) through a <b>self-sustained</b> <b>reaction</b> synthesis of vanadium, MgO, and Al powders (alloy VSHP). These powders were consolidated by hot isostatic pressing. Most of the V and spinel domains {{in the the}} compacts are sub-micron in size.

Three distinct universality classes are observed, consistent with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) class for fast advancing or receding fronts, the quenched KPZ class (positive-qKPZ) when the mean flow approximately cancels the reaction rate, and the negative-qKPZ class for slowly receding fronts.

Changing the temperature, pressure and reactant mixture conditions have a great effect on the intensity and periodicity of these oscillations. The goal for this research is to relate the reactivity and surface structure of the sample and also to create reproducible experiments, for which the right gas mixture is needed to cause the surface to exhibit these predictable reaction oscillations. Furthermore plotting the reflectivity data will reveal the texture of the sample in different moments of time.

30|$|Among the {{numerous}} existing RMFs, Al/CuO [17], Al/MoO 3 [18], Al/PTFE [19], B/Ti [20], and Al/Ni [21, 22] are most extensively studied. Al/Ni RMFs exhibits superiority {{due to their}} high reaction heat (330 [*]cal/g), outstanding fabrication quality, and cost efficiency. Many works have been conducted to reveal the thermodynamics properties and the exothermic <b>self-sustained</b> <b>reaction</b> performances of Al/Ni RMFs [23 – 26]. Results implicates that the reaction performances (e.g., maximum combustion temperature, combustion delay time) of Al/Ni RMFs depend strongly on their bilayer thickness [27]. The RMFs with thinner bilayers have enhanced fuel/oxidizer interfacial contact areas and reduced average atomic diffusion distances so as to promote chemical reaction initiation [28]. Meanwhile, the reaction velocity and temperature increases as the bilayer thickness decreases. However, when the bilayer thickness of RMFs is below 20 [*]nm, a contrary trend is found due {{to a large degree}} of intermixed region [29].|$|E
40|$|Reactive {{multilayered}} foils in {{the form}} of thin films have gained interest in various applications such as joining, welding, and ignition. Typically, thin film multilayers support self-propagating reaction fronts with speeds ranging from 1 to 20 [*]m/s. In some applications, however, reaction fronts with much smaller velocities are required. This recently motivated Fritz et al. (2011) to fabricate compacts of regular sized/shaped multilayered particles and demonstrate <b>self-sustained</b> <b>reaction</b> fronts having much smaller velocities than thin films with similar layering. In this work, we develop a simplified numerical model to simulate the self-propagation of reactive fronts in an idealized compact, comprising identical Ni/Al multilayered particles in thermal contact. The evolution of the reaction in the compact is simulated using a two-dimensional transient model, based on a reduced description of mixing, heat release, and thermal transport. Computed results reveal that an advancing reaction front can be substantially delayed as it crosses from one particle to a neighboring particle, which results in a reduced mean propagation velocity. A quantitative analysis is thus conducted on the dependence of these phenomena on the contact area between the particles, the thermal contact resistance, and the arrangement of the multilayered particles...|$|E

40|$|Self-healing {{materials}} {{are able to}} partially or completely reverse the damage inflicted on them. The possibility of self-healing mechanical and chemical failures that occur during service will improve the lifetime and reliability of structural materials. For this purpose, two main steps must be considered: (i) detection, and (ii) repairing (healing) of cracks. The exothermic character of reactive multilayers has potential for self-healing applications, namely in the healing step. In this context, Ni(V) /Al multilayer thin films were deposited onto tungsten wires by magnetron sputtering from two targets. A detailed microstructural characterization {{was carried out by}} scanning and transmission electron microscopy after deposition, as well as after ignition by applying an electrical discharge. The as-deposited films presented an irregular layered structure with local defects not observed for flat substrates, although Ni- and Al-rich nanolayers could be distinguished. The as-reacted films were constituted by Al 3 Ni 2 grains with Al 3 V phase at the grain boundaries. In order to use reactive multilayers for self-healing purposes, the heat released must be maximised by improving the microstructure of the nanolayered films. Nevertheless, after ignition, the Ni(V) /Al multilayer films deposited onto W wire underwent a <b>self-sustained</b> <b>reaction,</b> releasing heat...|$|E
40|$|Self-Propagating High-Temperature Synthesis (SHS), {{also called}} {{combustion}} synthesis is an exothermic and <b>self-sustained</b> <b>reaction</b> between the constituents, which has assumed {{significance for the}} production of ceramics and ceramic-metallic materials (cermets), because it is a very rapid processing technique without the need of complex furnaces. However, one of the drawbacks of this route is the high porosity of the final product (typically 50 %). This implies the need for a subsequent densification stage, e. g. by pressing. Combustion synthesized cermets such as TiC-based graded or TiB 2 based cermets can provide a good option for the fabrication of functionally graded material (FGM) components, e. g. to be used in armor applications (TiC based cermets) or for high and medium voltage switchgears (TiB 2 -based cermets). Self sustained High- Temperature Reactions (SHR) involve the initiation, and the subsequent propagation of a reaction front, the reaction being driven by heat release. Heat release from these reactions is potentially interesting for high temperature welding and brazing operations. Initiation of these reactions can take place by e. g. electrostatic discharge, mechanical (impact and shear) and thermal means. SHR might have applications in semi-conducting bridge and exploding foil initiators. Finally, these reactions might also have industrial relevance {{for the production of}} pyrotechnic delays.

40|$|Combustion {{synthesis}} {{has become}} an attractive method for preparing oxides and metallic materials for various applications including catalysts. One common combustion route is glycine–nitrate process (GNP). GNP involves a <b>self-sustained</b> <b>reaction</b> between metal nitrates (oxidizer) and glycine (fuel). The process {{is known to be}} rapid and simple, and generates catalyst powders that are high purity, crystalline and homogenous. In this work, Ni catalysts modified with La and Ce were synthesized using GNP. A precursor solution containing a stoichiometric mixture of metal nitrates was initially mixed with glycine at various glycine-nitrate ratios (G/N= 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5). The glycinenitrate solution was then heated to yield a gel-like liquid. The gel was further heated until it self-ignited and produced an ash powder. The catalyst ash was calcined at different temperatures (600 ‒ 800 °C) and then reduced at 700 °C. Catalyst characterization was performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Once produced using GNP, the La element in Ni catalyst modified with La was presence in a form of LaNiO phase. After reduction, Ni catalyst modified with La contains only Ni and La 2 O 3 phases. Meanwhile, Ce element in the Ni catalyst modified with Ce presence as CeO 2 phase after the GNP combustion. The CeO 2 phase remains after the reduction process and the reduced Ni catalyst modified with Ce composed of two separated phases; Ni and CeO 2. Glycine-nitrate (G/N) ratio shows a significant effect on the morphology of the catalysts. At G/N= 0. 5, where the fuel composition is less than the stoichiometric ratio, the ‘cottonwool-like’ and highly porous structure were observed for both Ni catalysts modified La and Ce. At the fuel composition higher than the stoichiometric ratio (G/N= 1. 5), both catalysts become dense in structure and contain less pores...|$|E
