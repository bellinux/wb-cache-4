40|$|We {{present a}} unique {{approach}} to identifying news <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> influence {{the behavior of}} financial markets. Specifically, we describe the design and implementation of &AElig;nalyst, a system that can recommend interesting news <b>stories</b> [...] <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> are likely to affect market behavior. &AElig;nalyst operates by correlating the content of news stories with trends in financial time series. We identify trends in time series using piecewise linear fitting and then assign labels to the trends according to an automated binning procedure. We use language models to represent patterns of language that are highly associated with particular labeled trends. &Aelig;nalyst can then identify and recommend news <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> are highly indicative of future trends. We evaluate the system {{in terms of its}} ability to recommend the <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> will a ect the behavior of the stock market. We demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>stories</b> recommended by &Aelig;nalyst could be used to profitably predict forthcoming trends in stock prices...|$|R
