5|$|Kaoru is the {{instructor}} of the Kamiya Kasshin martial-arts school. She inherited her fighting style {{and a small}} dojo from her father, who was drafted by a police swordsmen unit and died defending a comrade during the Seinan War. At {{the beginning of the}} story, Kaoru has no students and runs the dojo alone; she seems likely to lose it when Kenshin helps her. Despite occasional mood <b>swings</b> <b>and</b> a reputation for bad cooking, she is independent, compassionate, courageous and a good fighter. In her first appearance, Kaoru searches for the assassin Hitokiri Battosai, who claims to be from Kamiya Kasshin-ryu. Kaoru is saved by the real Battosai, Himura Kenshin, and invites him to her dojo.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Pauline was {{a cornerstone of}} EastEnders; the lynchpin of the Fowler/Beale family around whom the soap was originally structured. At {{the beginning of the}} serial in 1985, Pauline was a 40-year-old married mother with two teenage children, Mark and Michelle, and another child on the way. The fictional history of her younger years has been told via behind-the-scenes books such as EastEnders: The Inside Story, and the second tie-in novel by Hugh Miller, <b>Swings</b> <b>and</b> Roundabouts, which explains that Pauline was born and raised at 45 Albert Square, where she lived for her entire life. She married Arthur Fowler in 1965, raising her own children in the same house where she grew up.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Murphy was a loner with mood <b>swings</b> <b>and</b> an {{explosive}} temper. He {{grew up in}} Texas, around Farmersville, Greenville, and Celeste, where he attended elementary school. His father drifted {{in and out of}} the family's life and eventually deserted them. Murphy dropped out of school in fifth grade and got a job picking cotton for a dollar a day to help support his family; he also became skilled with a rifle, hunting small game to help feed them. After his mother died of endocarditis and pneumonia in 1941, he worked at a radio repair shop and at a combination general store, garage and gas station in Greenville. Hunt County authorities placed his three youngest siblings in Boles Children's Home, a Christian orphanage in Quinlan. After the war, he bought a house in Farmersville for his oldest sister Corinne and her husband Poland Burns. His other siblings briefly shared the home.|$|E

5|$|During battles, {{a weapon}} limit gauge is shown, filling up over time; by waiting to attack until the gauge is filled up, the player {{can use a}} more {{powerful}} attack specific to the currently equipped weapon. The gauge resets to zero whenever the player attacks or gets hit by an attack. The player is able to use various different types of weapons, such as swords, axes and flails, each having a different attack pattern: sword attacks, for example, are mid-ranged <b>swings</b> <b>and</b> stabs, while flail attacks are long-ranged and reach out {{in a straight line}} from the hero. Most weapons {{can also be used to}} affect the environment: the player can cut down trees with axes, for instance. There are also variants of each weapon type with bonus strengths, such as flame variations, which are effective against ice monsters. At various points in the game, the hero is accompanied by non-player characters who help the player defeat enemies. These companions have different abilities that the player can use, such as Fuji's healing spell and Watt's shop.|$|E
5|$|Interviewed by Wallace, McHenry admits being angry after {{discovering}} his girlfriend's infidelity but denies {{that the blood}} on his clothing is hers. Montgomery tries to convince King to report her rape; King refuses, telling Montgomery {{that she does not}} understand {{what it is like to}} be raped. Wilder uses alternative medicine to help King deal with her pain. Psychiatrist Violet Turner (Amy Brenneman) refuses to talk to King about the rape because of similarities to the fetal abduction she experienced a year earlier, and wonders if everyone in the practice is cursed. Bennett wants to go home and rest, which angers Montgomery. King attempts to compose a memorandum saying that she was attacked on the hospital grounds, but Freedman suggests that another member of the staff do it for her; she shouts at Freedman when he calls her a victim. After the argument, Freedman goes to King's office and weeps when he sees the aftermath of her assault. McHenry admits raping a woman, assaulting Wallace before he is pulled away by the police. In the ambulance bay, Bennett expresses his confusion about Montgomery's mood <b>swings</b> <b>and</b> suspects that she is hiding something from him; Montgomery asks him to promise never to leave her alone. After Freedman helps her dress, King says that she loves him and wants to go home. McHenry is held by the police for assaulting a police officer during his arrest and Wallace during his interrogation, but detective Joe Price says that McHenry cannot be charged with rape until charges are filed against him. The episode ends with King walking out of the hospital with Freedman's help; flashbacks of the rape reveal that McHenry was the rapist.|$|E

25|$|Children with {{hyperthyroidism}} tend to {{have greater}} mood <b>swings</b> <b>and</b> disturbances of behavior, as compared with adults. Their attention span decreases, they are usually hyperactive and distractible, they sleep poorly, and their school performance deteriorates.

25|$|Disagreeing {{with many}} {{mainstream}} economists of the day, {{he argued that}} these <b>swings,</b> <b>and</b> the booms and busts that can accompany them, are inevitable in a so-called free market economy – unless government steps in to control them, through regulation, central bank action and other tools. Such mechanisms did in fact come into existence in response to crises such as the Panic of 1907 and the Great Depression. Minsky opposed the deregulation that characterized the 1980s.|$|E
