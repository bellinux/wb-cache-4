With the semi-automatic transmissions, the driver shifted manually, selecting reverse or a low range and a high range. Each 'range' had two speeds. To shift between them, the driver accelerated then released pressure on the accelerator. In high range, this <b>shift</b> <b>point</b> was about 23 mph (37 kmh). The transmission shifted into high speed range, the driver then depressed the accelerator pedal, and continued accelerating. The solenoids on the transmission connected to the carburetor and ignition system and momentarily interrupted engine operation to allow trouble-free shifting.|$|E

It deals with the analysis of the historical spatiotemporal variability of rainfall on the annual, seasonal and monthly scale in 18 districts of the state Jharkhand over a period of 102 years (1901 – 2002). Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen’s slope method were applied to detect trends and the magnitude of change over the time period of 102 years (1901 – 2002). Mann Whitney Pettit’s method and Cumulative deviations test were applied for detection of <b>shift</b> <b>point</b> in the series.

Some heuristic criteria have been employed for selecting the linear <b>shift</b> <b>point</b> ‘a’, based upon the means (arithmetic, harmonic and geometric) of real parts of the poles of high order system.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a mean shift with an unknown <b>shift</b> <b>point</b> in a linear process and estimates the unknown <b>shift</b> <b>point</b> (change point) by {{the method of}} least squares. Pre-shift and post-shift means are estimated concurrently with the change point. The consistency {{and the rate of}} convergence for the estimated change point are established. The asymptotic distribution for the change point estimator is obtained when the magnitude of shift is small. It is shown that serial correlation affects the variance of the change point estimator via the sum of the coefficients (impulses) of the linear process. When the underlying process is an ARMA, a mean shift causes overestimation of its order. A simple procedure is suggested to mitigate the bias in order estimation. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} whether the boundaries between the happy and angry emotions of schizophrenia would be influenced by social context and the difference in emotion categorization boundaries between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. Method: Eighteen patients with schizophrenia and 16 healthy controls were given a forced-choice emotion identification task in which they were required to listen to a series of conversations with different social contexts. The stimuli were linear morphed facial expressions between 'happy' and 'angry' emotions. For each type of social context, the <b>shift</b> <b>point</b> was used as the parameter to estimate when the subjects began to perceive the morphed facial expression as angry. The response slope was used to estimate how abruptly this change in perception occurred. Results: There was no significant difference in the schizophrenia group in the <b>shift</b> <b>point</b> of emotion categorization perception for four categories of conversations occurring in different social contexts. Compared with the healthy controls, the schizophrenia group demonstrated a steeper response slope at the <b>shift</b> <b>point</b> regardless of the conversation type. Conclusion: The patients with schizophrenia were less discriminative in their categorization of emotion perception in conversations with different social contexts.

40|$|Limited {{research}} has specifically examined {{the nature of}} the dysfunction in emotion categorization representation in schizophrenia. The current study aimed to investigate the perception bias of morphed facial expression in subjects with schizophrenia and healthy controls in the emotion continua. Twenty-eight patients with schizophrenia and thirty-one healthy controls took part in this study. They were administered a standardized set of morphed photographs of facial expressions with varying emotional intensities between 0 % and 100 % of the emotion, in 10 % increments to provide a range of intensities from pleasant to unpleasant and approach to withdraw. Shift points, indicating the time point that the subjects&# 39; emotion identification begins to change, and response slopes, indicating how rapidly these changes have happened at the shift points in the emotion continuum, were measured. Patients exhibited a significantly greater response slope (i. e., patients&# 39; perception changed more rapidly) and greater <b>shift</b> <b>point</b> (i. e., patients still perceived mild expressions of anger as happy faces) with increasing emotion signal compared with healthy controls when the facial expression morphed from happy to angry. Furthermore, patients with schizophrenia still perceived mild expressions of fear as angry faces(a greater <b>shift</b> <b>point)</b> and were less discriminative from angry to fearful emotion(a flatter response slope). They were sensitive to sadness (a smaller <b>shift</b> <b>point)</b> and the perception changed rapidly (a sharper response slope) as compared with healthy controls in the emotion continuum of happy to sad. In conclusion, patients with schizophrenia demonstrated impaired categorical perception of facial expressions, with generally &# 39;rapid&# 39; but &# 39;late&# 39; discrimination towards social threat-related stimuli such as angry facial expression. Compared with healthy controls, these patients have a sharper discrimination perception pattern in the emotion continua from positive valence to negative valence. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|In {{bacterial}} circular chromosomes {{and most}} plasmids, the replication {{is known to}} be terminated when either of the following occurs: the forks progressing in opposite directions meet at the distal end of the chromosome or the replication forks become trapped by Tus proteins bound to Ter sites. Most bacterial genomes have various polarities in their genomic structures. The most notable feature is polar genomic compositional asymmetry of the bases G and C in the leading and lagging strands, called GC skew. This asymmetry is caused by replication-associated mutation bias, and this "footprint" of the replication machinery suggests that, in contrast to the two known mechanisms, replication termination occurs near the chromosome dimer resolution site dif. To understand this difference between the known replication machinery and genomic compositional bias, we undertook a simulation study of genomic mutations, and we report here how different replication termination models contribute to the generation of replication-related genomic compositional asymmetry. Contrary to naive expectations, our results show that a single finite termination site at dif or at the GC skew <b>shift</b> <b>point</b> is not sufficient to reconstruct the genomic compositional bias as observed in published sequences. The results also show that the known replication mechanisms are sufficient to explain the position of the GC skew <b>shift</b> <b>point...</b>|$|E
