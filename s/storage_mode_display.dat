40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} the nonlinear differential equation (∂u/∂t) = L(u) + f(t). Use of Galerkin FEM with u(x,t) ≈v(x,t) =∑j= 1 nγj(t) Nj(x), where the Nj(x) are specified basis functions, {{results in the}} implicit system of ordinary differential equations, (∗) ∑j= 1 nAijγ̇j−Bi(γ 1,…,γn,f) = 0, i= 1,…,n where Aij = 〈Ni, Nj〉, Bi = 〈Ni, L(v) + f〉. The method chosen for solution of stiff systems (∗), is a version of Gear's method which solves the system in its implicit form. This leads to the necessity {{of being able to}} solve (repeatedly) linear algebraic equations whose coefficient matrix has the same sparse and banded nature as (Aij). Storage requirements for various orders of polynomial trangular elements under compact <b>storage</b> <b>mode,</b> profile <b>storage</b> <b>mode,</b> and banded symmetric <b>storage</b> <b>mode</b> are given and compared. For large systems (∗), compact <b>storage</b> <b>mode</b> leads to significantly reduced requirements. Consideration of the linear algebraic systems which arise in Gear's method reveals that iteration should be computationally efficient. A comparison between various solutions methods is given for a nonlinear reactor dynamics problem. Associated with each solution method is a different <b>storage</b> <b>mode...</b>|$|R

50|$|Electrons {{were first}} stored in ASTRID in 1991 {{and by this}} time two beamlines had been {{constructed}} {{to make use of}} the synchrotron light, a surface science beamline (SX700) and an x-ray microscope (XM). Ion storage in ASTRID dominated in the early 90s, with many successful experiments storing both positive and negative ions ranging in mass from 1 (hydrogen atom) to 840 (carbon 70 cluster). Meanwhile, the synchrotron radiation based research at ISA was expanding, and by 1995 ASTRID was operated 50% of the time in ion <b>storage</b> <b>mode</b> and 50% for synchrotron radiation. With the construction of the Electrostatic Storage Ring for Ions (ELISA) in 1998, and an increasing demand for synchrotron radiation (by 2000 there were 7 beamlines on ASTRID using the light source), the ion storage runs were gradually reduced, until finally in 2005 ASTRID operated in ion <b>storage</b> <b>mode</b> for the last time. Since then ASTRID has been operating in electron <b>storage</b> <b>mode</b> producing synchrotron radiation throughout the year, with 3 or 4 electron runs, separated by shutdown periods for maintenance and development of the ring.|$|R

40|$|Block {{stacking}} storage guarantees high {{storage density}} for end-of-line warehouses in product flow manufacturing systems, which are mostly diffused in food processing and beverage industry. These storage systems, characterized by high volumes per item and limited inventory mix, are organized through storage deep lanes of homogeneous items. Setting the optimal lane depths for the incoming stock-keeping-units (SKUs) influences the overall {{space and time}} efficiency performances, {{as well as the}} layout of the storage zones, the selection of the proper <b>storage</b> <b>modes</b> and equipment. This paper illustrates an original decision-support model to (1) manage existing block storage warehouses, and (2) to aid the design of new block storage systems from green field. The management of a warehouse (1) deals with the assignment of the incoming product lots to the optimal lane depth, <b>storage</b> <b>mode,</b> and zone in a constrained and capacitated storage environment. The design of a warehouse from green field (2) is aided by identifying the optimal configuration of lane depths and <b>storage</b> <b>modes</b> that minimizes the infrastructural costs. The proposed model is formulated via integer linear programming (ILP) and minimizes mutually the costs generated by space and time inefficiencies. The illustrated results obtained by its application to a real case study from the beverage industry, candidate the model as a tool to aid operative and strategic layout issues in deep lane storage systems...|$|R

Additionally, the 3 D NAND showed less MBU susceptibility than the planar NAND, with reduced number of upset bits per byte and reduced cross sections overall. However, the 3 D architecture exhibited angular sensitivities for both base and face angles, reflecting the anisotropic nature of the SEU vulnerability in space. Furthermore, the SEU cross section decreased with increasing fluence for both the 3 D NAND and the latest generation planar NAND, indicating a variable upset rate for a space mission. These unique characteristics introduce complexity to traditional ground irradiation test procedures...|$|R
