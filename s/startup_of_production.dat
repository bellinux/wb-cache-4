40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} realizing IC (integrate circuit) equipment control software-oriented GUI (graphical user interface) platformization, comprising the following steps: developing a corresponding IC equipment drive module {{in accordance with the}} characteristics of different manufacturers&# 39; IC equipment and drawing a GUI platform; connecting the monitoring host of the IC equipment to a controller through the IC equipment drive module, thereby forming a communication network; the IC equipment drive module reads data in the controller through the connection network and maps the data to the general data layer of the GUI platform; the GUI platform performs real-time display, control, and exception handling on the data through the general data layer, thus realizing GUI platformization of the IC equipment control software. The present invention realizes a cross-platform mechanism, improves the cluster monitoring ability of the wafer manufacturing equipment, is able to meet the user&# 39;s demands for flexible configuration of the human-machine interface of the corresponding control system such that the whole production process can be quickly configured in a very short time, and meets the needs <b>of</b> advanced <b>startup</b> <b>of</b> the <b>production...</b>|$|R
40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} or 3 D printing, manufacturing {{a product}} layer by layer, offers large design freedom and faster product development cycles, {{as well as}} low <b>startup</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> on-demand production and local production. In principle, any product could be made by additive manufacturing. Even food and living organic cells can be printed. We can create, design and manufacture what we want at the location we want. 3 D printing will create a revolution in manufacturing, a real paradigm change. 3 D printing holds the promise to manufacture with less waste and energy. We can print metals, ceramics, sand, synthetic materials such as plastics, food or living cells. However, the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> plastics is nowadays based on fossil fuels. And that’s where we witness a paradigm change too. The <b>production</b> <b>of</b> these synthetic materials can be based also on biomaterials with biomass as feedstock. A wealth of new and innovative products are emerging when we combine these two paradigm changes: 3 D printing and biomaterials. Moreover, the combination of 3 D printing with biomaterials holds the promise to realize a truly sustainable and circular economy. ...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing {{organizations}} {{have to become}} more competitive. There are two important things a company can do: become more efficient in all operations and introduce new products. Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) is a production philosophy that contributes to more efficiency. The introduction of new products sometimes require new production lines, which have to be started up. In this research TPM and the <b>startup</b> <b>of</b> a new <b>production</b> line come together. This thesis tries to create more insight in what influences {{the success of the}} TPM elements Early Equipment Management (EEM), Autonomous Maintenance (AM) and Training and Education (T&E) in the <b>startup</b> <b>of</b> a new <b>production</b> line by investigating the three elements during a case study at the packaging department of Heineken Zoeterwoude. Success has a different definition looking at the three elements. EEM success is defined as equipment satisfaction and vertical startup. AM success is defined as a quick and successful implementation of AM step three in the new line. Finally T&E success is defined as what operators find important in a T&E program during a startup. This research searched for factors that influence these successes. To realize this, this research first broadly consolidated TPM literature which appeared not to be sufficient. Additional theory was needed. Therefore the three elements were thoroughly observed and studies at Heineken, to find similarities with other theories. This showed that looking at the success of EEM, theory on systems engineering, production startup (problems) and project and process management seemed applicable to add possible influential factors. AM at Heineken showed that a lot of general TPM implementation barriers appeared (apart from AM barriers). Therefore theory on general TPM implementation barriers seem appropriate to add possible influential factors to AM. T&E was a bit harder, because it was obvious that theory on learning seems applicable, but hard to investigate. Therefore the choice was made to look for factors that could improve learning and let operators elaborate on these. Theory on learning improvement was therefore used. To investigate all factors, for each elements different important responders were questioned {{and on top of that}} extensive observations were done by close participation in the startup. This research showed that for EEM, theory on systems engineering could be a important contributor to EEM success. Also theory on production startup (problems) has to be taken into account since factors form this theory could influence EEM success. The impact of project and process management was not really indicated in this research, but there contribution to EEM success is assumed, because factors from project and process management do influence other factors (that do influence EEM success). Secondly this research showed that apart from AM barriers, general TPM implementation barriers have a large impact on a successful implementation of AM in the <b>startup</b> <b>of</b> a new <b>production</b> line. Thirdly this research showed that theory on learning improvement is important to show what operators find important in a T&E program when starting up a new line. Finally this research showed that there are a lot of relation between influential factors looking at the three elements. Factors influencing each other suggests that some are higher in hierarchy as others. Looking at all the influential factors, their descriptions given by respondents and the relations between them, made it easy to set very tangible recommendations for Heineken, so that these elements can be more successfully managed in future startups.

40|$|During the <b>startup</b> phase <b>of</b> a <b>production</b> process while {{statistics}} on the product quality are being collected {{it is useful to}} establish that the process is under control. Small samples { ni}i= 1 q are taken periodically for q periods. We shall assume each measurement is bivariate. A process is under control or on-target if all the observations are deemed to be independent and identically distributed and moreover the distribution of each observation is a product distribution. This would be the case if each coordinate of an observation is a nominal value plus noise. Let Fi represent the empirical distribution function of the i-th sample. Let F represent the empirical distribution function of all observations. Following Lehman (1951) we propose statistics of the form∑i = 1 q∫-∞∞∫-∞∞(Fi(s,t) - F(s) F(t)) 2 dF(s,t) (1) The emphasis there, however, is on the case where ni → ∞ while q stayed fixed. Here we study the following family of statisticsSq=∑i = 1 q∫-∞∞∫-∞∞kq(n, i, Fi(s,t),F(s) F(t)) nidFi(s,t) (2) in the above quality control situation, where q→∞ while ni stays fixed.
