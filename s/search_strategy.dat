5|$|On 17 March, Australia {{took control}} for {{co-ordinating}} search, rescue, and recovery operations. For the following six weeks, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) and ATSB worked {{to determine the}} search area, correlating information with the JIT and other government and academic sources, while the Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) coordinated the search efforts. Following the fourth phase of the search, the ATSB took responsibility for defining the search area. In May, the <b>search</b> <b>strategy</b> working group was established by the ATSB to determine the most likely position on the aircraft at the 00:19 UTC (08:19 MYT) satellite transmission. The group included aircraft and satellite experts from: Air Accidents Investigation Branch (UK), Boeing (US), Defence Science and Technology Group (Australia), Department of Civil Aviation (Malaysia), Inmarsat (UK), National Transportation Safety Board (US), and Thales (UK).|$|E

It was clear that the position given in Titanics distress signals was inaccurate, which was a major expedition difficulty because it increased the search area's already-massive size. Despite the failure of his 1977 expedition, Robert Ballard had not given up hope and devised new technologies and a new <b>search</b> <b>strategy</b> to tackle the problem. The new technology was a system called Argo / Jason. This consisted of a remotely controlled deep-sea vehicle called Argo, equipped with sonar and cameras and towed behind a ship, with a robot called Jason tethered to it that could roam the sea floor, take close-up images and gather specimens. The images from the system would be transmitted back to a control room on the towing vessel where they could be assessed immediately. Although it was designed for scientific purposes, it also had important military applications and the United States Navy agreed to sponsor the system's development, on condition that it was to be used to carry out a number of programmes – many still classified – for the Navy.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, {{we found}} that the two {{different}} optimization strategies yield different reconstruction resolutions for the same target module (Table  1). The separate <b>searching</b> <b>strategy</b> (Fig.  3 B) had a slightly better result than the exhaustive simultaneous <b>searching</b> <b>strategy</b> (Fig.  3 A). One {{reason for this is that}} for the separate <b>searching</b> <b>strategy</b> the final shift parameters are the average of ten optimized values from ten randomly selected trial angles, which overcomes the limitation of sampling only in integer steps, thereby increasing the accuracy of shift parameter determination. It is worth noting that, the separate <b>searching</b> <b>strategy</b> is also more efficient, requiring less intensive computation than that of the exhaustive simultaneous <b>searching</b> <b>strategy.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective General practitioners, {{mental health}} practitioners, and {{researchers}} wishing {{to retrieve the}} best current research evidence in the content area of mental health may {{have a difficult time}} when searching large electronic databases such as MEDLINE. When MEDLINE is searched unaided, key articles are often missed while retrieving many articles that are irrelevant to the search. The objectives of this study were to develop optimal <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> to detect articles with mental health content and to determine the effect of combining mental health content <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> with methodologic <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> calibrated to detect the best studies of treatment. Method An analytic survey was conducted, comparing hand searches of 29 journals with retrievals from MEDLINE for 3, 395 candidate search terms and 11, 317 combinations. The sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy of the <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> were calculated. Results 3, 277 (26. 8 %) of the 12, 233 articles classified in the 29 journals were considered to be of interest to the discipline area of mental health. Search term combinations reached peak sensitivities of 98. 4 % with specificity at 50. 0 %, whereas combinations of search terms to optimize specificity reached peak specificities of 97. 1 % with sensitivity at 51. 7 %. Combining content <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> with methodologic <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> for treatment led to improved precision: substantive decreases in the number of articles that needed to be sorted through in order to find target articles. Conclusion Empirically derived <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> can achieve high sensitivity and specificity for retrieving mental health content from MEDLINE. Combining content <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> with methodologic <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> led to more precise searches. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Research for {{developing}} <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> to retrieve high-quality clinical journal articles from MEDLINE is expensive and time-consuming. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine the minimal number of high-quality articles in a journal subset that would need to be hand-searched to update or create new MEDLINE <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> for treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis studies. Methods The desired width of the 95 % confidence intervals (W) for the lowest sensitivity among existing <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> was used to calculate the number of high-quality articles needed to reliably update <b>search</b> <b>strategies.</b> New <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> were derived in journal subsets formed by 2 approaches: random sampling of journals and top journals (having the most high-quality articles). The new strategies were tested in both the original large journal database and in a low-yielding journal (having few high-quality articles) subset. Results For treatment studies, if W was 10 % or less for the lowest sensitivity among our existing <b>search</b> <b>strategies,</b> a subset of 15 randomly selected journals or 2 top journals were adequate for updating <b>search</b> <b>strategies,</b> based on each approach having at least 99 high-quality articles. The new strategies derived in 15 randomly selected journals or 2 top journals performed well in the original large journal database. Nevertheless, the new <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> developed using the random sampling approach performed better than those developed using the top journal approach in a low-yielding journal subset. For studies of diagnosis and prognosis, no journal subset had enough high-quality articles to achieve the expected W (10 %). Conclusion The approach of randomly sampling a small subset of journals that includes sufficient high-quality articles is an efficient way to update or create <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> for high-quality articles on therapy in MEDLINE. The concentrations of diagnosis and prognosis articles are too low for this approach. </p...|$|R

25|$|An {{alternative}} method of structural learning uses optimization based search. It requires a scoring function and a <b>search</b> <b>strategy.</b> A common scoring function is posterior probability {{of the structure}} given the training data, like the BIC or the BDeu. The time requirement of an exhaustive search returning a structure that maximizes the score is superexponential {{in the number of}} variables. A local <b>search</b> <b>strategy</b> makes incremental changes aimed at improving the score of the structure. A global search algorithm like Markov chain Monte Carlo can avoid getting trapped in local minima. Friedman et al. discuss using mutual information between variables and finding a structure that maximizes this. They do this by restricting the parent candidate set to k nodes and exhaustively searching therein.|$|E

40|$|Visual {{search in}} an {{important}} aspect of many tasks, but it is not well understood how many aspects of layout design affect visual search. This research investigates, with reaction time and eye movement data, the effect of local density on the visual search of structured layouts of words. Layouts were allsparse, all-dense, or mixed. Participants found targets in sparse groups faster even after numerosity effects were factored out, and searched sparse groups before dense groups. Participants made slightly more fixations per word in sparse groups, but these were much shorter fixations. Perhaps most interesting, roughly halfway through searching each mixed layout, participants appeared to switch <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> with respect to the number of fixations per group of words and fixation duration. When dense groups were searched early in a trial, <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> were more similar to <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> in the all-sparse layouts. When searched later in a trial, <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> were more similar to <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> of all-dense groups.

40|$|The {{shift towards}} {{more open and}} {{interconnected}} innovation activities {{has been a major}} topic of recent academic and practitioner discussions. Firms have to connect their in-house R&D activities with external partners, such as leading customers or universities, to increase the effectiveness of their innovation activities. Hence, management needs to define <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> for valuable knowledge in its environment. In this paper we argue conceptually that <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> have to reflect the heterogeneities of various knowledge sources with regard to the knowledge they can provide and how these sources can be activated. We hypothesize that science-, supply- and market-driven <b>search</b> <b>strategies</b> will contribute differently to innovation success with radically new versus incrementally refined products. What is more, we suggest that innovation in service sectors is fundamentally different in nature which also influences the performance of different <b>search</b> <b>strategies.</b> We test these hypotheses for a sample of more than 5, 000 firms from 5 European countries based on a harmonized survey. The results support our major hypotheses and highlight the potentials and shortcomings of different <b>search</b> <b>strategies.</b> Targeted management recommendations are derived based on these results...|$|R
