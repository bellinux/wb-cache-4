40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} if extracts of Hypericum perforatum (St John's wort) {{are more}} effective than placebo {{in the treatment of}} depression, are as effective as standard antidepressive treatment, and have fewer side effects than standard antidepressant drugs. DESIGN [...] Systematic review and meta-analysis of trials revealed by searches. TRIALS [...] 23 randomised trials including a total of 1757 outpatients with mainly mild or moderately severe depressive disorders: 15 (14 testing <b>single</b> <b>preparations</b> and one a combination with other plant extracts) were placebo controlled, and eight (six testing <b>single</b> <b>preparations</b> and two combinations) compared hypericum with another drug treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] A pooled estimate of the responder rate ratio (responder rate in treatment group/responder rate in control group), and numbers of patients reporting and dropping out for side effects. RESULTS [...] Hypericum extracts were significantly superior to placebo (ratio = 2. 67; 95 % confidence interval 1. 78 to 4. 01) and similarly effective as standard antidepressants (<b>single</b> <b>preparations</b> 1. 10; 0. 93 to 1. 31, combinations 1. 52; 0. 78 to 2. 94). There were two (0. 8 %) drop outs for side effects with hypericum and seven (3. 0 %) with standard antidepressant drugs. Side effects occurred in 50 (19. 8 %) patients on hypericum and 84 (52. 8 %) patients on standard antidepressants. CONCLUSION [...] There is evidence that extracts of hypericum {{are more effective}} than placebo for the treatment of mild to moderately severe depressive disorders. Further studies comparing extracts with standard antidepressants in well defined groups of patients and comparing different extracts and doses are needed...|$|R

40|$|Background There is {{evidence}} regarding the abuse potential of buprenorphine in prison settings. There is also emerging evidence from community settings that buprenorphine/naloxone is less amenable to abuse than the <b>single</b> <b>preparation</b> buprenorphine hydrochloride {{as evidenced by}} cost-differentials of diverted medication. This study sought to explore cost-differentials within a prison setting of diverted buprenorphine/naloxone medication relative to either <b>single</b> <b>preparation</b> buprenorphine hydrochloride or methadone. Methods Cross-sectional survey in one remand prison. Results A total of 85 prisoners participated in the survey. Prisoners estimated buprenorphine to have a significantly (p < 0. 001) higher cost than buprenorphine/naloxone {{both inside and outside}} of prison. This finding was supported when the analysis was restricted to both the prisoners with a longer-term experience of taking opioid substitution drugs during their current prison stay and those with a longer-term experience prior to reception. Conclusions Consideration should be given to the recommendation that buprenorphine/naloxone medication is the prescribed buprenorphine preparation of choice for clinicians offering opiate substitution therapy to prisoners, pending developments of buprenorphine preparations that have less abuse potential than sublingual preparations...|$|E

To achieve comparability in the effects of ionic strenght (I) and of pH on K'(A) and B(max.) appropriate measurements have been made simultaneously on <b>single</b> <b>preparations.</b> K'(A) and B(max.) were found to be effectively unchanged over the range I 0. 05 - 0. 60. Both parameters have been measured over the range pH 6. 4 - 9. 0 and the vlaues of K'(A) analysed in terms of the 4 '-OH ionization of T 3 and that of a cationic acidic group, shown to require pK' = 7. 6. This group could be identified either with the terminal α-NH 3 + of T 3 or with a group (RH+) in the receptor site. On the balance of evidence the first possibility is more likely, in which case the variation of B(max.) with pH is ascribed to conformational changes in the receptor protein. Articl...|$|R

To address this question, we measured multiple cellular and synaptic parameters within individual preparations to see how they correlate with circuit function, using neurons and synapses within the pyloric circuit of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab Cancer borealis. There was considerable preparation-to-preparation variability in the strength of two identified synapses, in the amplitude of a modulator-evoked current, and in the expression of six ion channel genes. Nonetheless, across preparations we found strong correlations among these parameters and attributes of circuit performance. These data illustrate the importance of making multidimensional measurements from <b>single</b> <b>preparations</b> to understand how variability in circuit output is related to the variability of multiple circuit parameters...|$|R
