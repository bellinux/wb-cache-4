5000|$|The {{model for}} <b>Superbug</b> was Herbie from the Disney movie {{franchise}} {{that started in}} 1968.

In the first film, <b>Superbug</b> Goes Wild, <b>Superbug</b> is still {{far from being a}} self-aware high-tech vehicle. In some scenes, it has animated eyes and can speak and cry, thus appealing to children. The popularity of the VW Beetle had plummeted in the mid-1970s and production was discontinued in Germany in 1978. In the final movie of the series made in the same year, the Beetle body shell was merely hiding a small 6-wheel amphibious All Terrain Vehicle that interacted with a small crab-like robot named Picho, both with big eye-like headlights.|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} decades, the {{increase}} of antibiotic resistance {{has become a major}} concern worldwide. The researchers found that <b>superbugs</b> with new type of resistance genes (NDM- 1) have two aspects of transmission characteristics; the first is that the antibiotic resistance genes can horizontally transfer among bacteria, and the other is that the <b>superbugs</b> can spread between humans through direct contact. Based on these two transmission mechanisms, we study the dynamics of population in hospital environment where <b>superbugs</b> exist. In this paper, we build three mathematic models to illustrate the dynamics of patients with bacterial resistance in hospital environment. The models are analyzed using stability theory of differential equations. Positive equilibrium points of the system are investigated and their stability analysis is carried out. Moreover, the numerical simulation of the proposed model is also performed which supports the theoretical findings...|$|R

40|$|The {{learning}} {{comprehension of}} students in microbiology classes {{is not easy to}} evaluate, particularly when the student population is diverse in terms of backgrounds, majors, levels of training and preparedness, and the students’ expectations and enthusiasm for the class. It is difficult to design a one-size-fits-all exam that best suits a mixed student population; and most traditional assignments/case studies focusing on particular microbes or topics might not readily assess students’ overall understanding and learning comprehension. It is important to develop an assessment method that not only can engage students in active learning and deliberate practice but can also promote their imaginative and creative potential. The word “superbugs” often appears in the media and refers to some deadly or drug-resistant microbes. These <b>superbugs</b> possess special phenotypic and functional attributes that constitute their “superness. ” It is predicted that more new surprising <b>superbugs</b> will emerge in the future and students should be challenged now with some mindstimulating ideas and exercises in their microbiology class. To develop a supplementary tool to evaluate students’ comprehension and to prepare them for the predicted <b>superbugs</b> unknown to us, a writing project entitled “Constructing Your Own Superbug” was designed to achieve these goals. <br /...|$|R
