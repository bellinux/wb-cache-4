5|$|For the centenary of {{the first}} {{official}} immigration of Norwegians to America, President Calvin Coolidge stated at the 1925 Minnesota State Fair, to a crowd of 100,000 people, that Leif had indeed been the first European to discover America. Further statues of him were erected at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul in 1949, near Lake <b>Superior</b> <b>in</b> Duluth in 1956, and in downtown Seattle.|$|E
5|$|Gorgias, in Plato's homonymous dialogue, uses Pericles as {{an example}} of {{powerful}} oratory. In Menexenus, however, Socrates (through Plato) casts aspersions on Pericles' rhetorical fame, claiming ironically that, since Pericles was educated by Aspasia, a trainer of many orators, he would be <b>superior</b> <b>in</b> rhetoric to someone educated by Antiphon. He also attributes authorship of the Funeral Oration to Aspasia and attacks his contemporaries' veneration of Pericles.|$|E
5|$|In the {{treatment}} of diabetic foot infections, linezolid appears to be cheaper and more effective than vancomycin. In a 2004 open-label study, it was as effective as ampicillin/sulbactam and Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and far <b>superior</b> <b>in</b> patients with foot ulcers and no osteomyelitis, but with significantly higher rates of adverse effects. A 2008 meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials, however, found that linezolid treatment failed as often as other antibiotics, regardless of whether patients had osteomyelitis.|$|E

50|$|Upon hearing initial {{rumors of}} closure by Trappist <b>superiors</b> <b>in</b> Kentucky, a monk named Father George started a {{campaign}} to keep the monastery going. During a 1908 visit from the Kentucky abbot, however, the superior saw the debris from the fire and the monks' financial struggle. Despite Father George's demonstrative pleading during the <b>superior's</b> visit, <b>in</b> 1909 the monks were ordered back to France. When a letter from Trappist <b>superiors</b> <b>in</b> Rome arrived and explained {{the reasons for the}} order, Father George wrote a letter of submission. Some monks returned to France, but others became Benedictines or priests of the Archdiocese of Oregon City.|$|R

Advances have led to the proposal of new diagnostic criteria.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota has a {{continental}} climate, with hot summers and cold winters. Minnesota's {{location in the}} Upper Midwest allows it to experience some of the widest variety of weather in the United States, {{with each of the}} four seasons having its own distinct characteristics. The areas near Lake <b>Superior</b> <b>in</b> the Minnesota Arrowhead region experience weather unique {{from the rest of the}} state. The moderating effect of Lake Superior keeps the surrounding area relatively cooler in the summer and relatively warmer in the winter, giving that region a smaller yearly temperature range. On the Köppen climate classification, much of the southern third of Minnesota—roughly from the Twin Cities region southward—falls in the hot summer humid continental climate zone (Dfa), and the northern two-thirds of Minnesota falls in the warm summer great continental climate zone (Dfb).|$|E
5|$|On 30 January 2008, Ao {{was found}} guilty on 40 counts of bribe-taking, 13 counts of money laundering, two counts of abuse of power, one count of {{incorrect}} declaration of assets and one count of holding assets from unknown sources; Ao was sentenced to 27 years in prison. About MOP 252 million of his assets in Macau were seized. Ao decided not to appeal. There were concerns voiced in the Macau media that Ao was the fall-guy, as most Macanese were sceptical that corruption on such a scale could take place without anyone else knowing or being involved. During his trial, Ao hinted that contacts valued at in excess of 6 million Patacas required the approval of his <b>superior</b> <b>in</b> government, Edmond Ho.|$|E

5|$|Recognized as the {{principal}} chief of the Lake Superior Chippewa (Ojibwa) for nearly a half-century {{until his death in}} 1855, he led his nation into a treaty relationship with the United States Government. He signed treaties in 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847, and 1854. He was instrumental in resisting the efforts of the United States to remove the Chippewa to western areas and secured permanent Indian reservations for his people near Lake <b>Superior</b> <b>in</b> what is now known as Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the lengthy building times of these ships, other countries were able to build dreadnoughts that were <b>superior</b> <b>in</b> protection and armament, {{with the exception of}} the French. Construction was delayed by late deliveries of the 305-millimeter guns and armor plates as well as shortages of labor. The Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912 diverted workers at the shipyards for repairs and maintenance of the ships participating in the war. The Italians imported the raw nickel steel for their armor from America and Britain and processed it into their equivalent of Krupp cemented armor, called Terni cemented, but there were problems with this process and suitable plates took longer to produce than planned.|$|E
5|$|Testing was, however, able to {{continue}} in the meantime, as Platt-LePage had re-negotiated the XR-1 contract to cover a second flight-test aircraft. Built to a revised and improved version of the XR-1's design and designated XR-1A, the second aircraft had flown {{for the first time in}} May 1943. The XR-1A featured a revised cockpit covering compared to that of the XR-1, with the area of glazing being increased for improved visibility, and the pilot and observer's positions being reversed, the pilot now seated in the rear cockpit. During flight testing the XR-1A was found <b>superior</b> <b>in</b> flight performance to the XR-1; however, the controls were still proving troublesome, although the worst of the bugs did seem to have been worked out.|$|E

5|$|The Confederate army {{made several}} other {{attempts}} {{to cross the}} trench during the night but repeatedly failed. Although the confederates could have deployed their infantry over the whole length of the trench, they were unwilling to engage the Muslims at close quarter as the former regarded the latter as <b>superior</b> <b>in</b> hand-to-hand fighting. As the Muslim army was well dug in behind the embankment made from the earth which {{had been taken from}} the ditch and prepared to bombard attackers with stones and arrows, any attack could cause great casualties.|$|E

The highway runs through forest lands and city streets most of the way, with the section along the Portage Lake Canal being residential most of the way.|$|E
5|$|The group {{recorded}} several independent EPs {{and played}} primarily in their New Orleans area before becoming noticed by Sparrow Records {{at a concert}} in 1999.

Shortly after, the band left Sparrow and drifted {{out of the public}} eye. A final album, entitled The Rise of Modern Simulation was independently released before the group disbanded in 2003. Many of the band members continue to play together and collaborate in various bands, namely Mutemath and Club of the Sons.|$|E

Snowden stated that he raised concerns with two <b>superiors</b> <b>in</b> the Hawaii regional base of the NSA Threat Operations Center and two <b>superiors</b> <b>in</b> the Technology Directorate of the NSA beginning in October 2012, and therefore that counted as using internal dissent channels in the NSA.|$|R

During his quest, Kratos has flashbacks to this period, as he searches for the Ambrosia to save his newly-born daughter, Calliope, who is suffering from the plague. Given until the next full moon, General Kratos travels with a host of Spartans to find the Ambrosia. During this period, he takes counsel from Captain Nikos, his <b>superior</b> <b>in</b> the Spartan army who instructs him about the Spartan code of honor.|$|E
5|$|These {{areas have}} or {{will have a}} {{different}} mandate than their terrestrial counterparts.

The first to be announced was Lake <b>Superior</b> <b>in</b> 2007; it was officially established in 2015.

5|$|Venice {{could not}} {{directly}} confront the large Ottoman expeditionary force on Crete, {{but it did}} possess a fine navy, that could intervene and cut the Ottoman supply routes. In 1645, the Venetians and their allies possessed a fleet of 60–70 galleys, 4 galleasses and about 36 galleons. The Venetians were also <b>superior</b> <b>in</b> their use of a mixed fleet of both galleys and sailing ships, while initially, the Ottoman navy relied almost exclusively on galleys. In order to bolster their forces, both opponents hired armed merchantmen from the Netherlands, and later from England (especially the Ottomans), to augment their forces.|$|E
