40|$|In the UK, the ‘leaky pipeline’ metaphor {{has been}} used to {{describe}} the relationship between ethnicity and <b>science</b> participation. Fewer minority ethnic students continue with <b>science</b> in post-compulsory education, and {{little is known about the}} ways in which they participate and identify with <b>science,</b> particularly in the secondary school context. Drawing on an exploratory study of 46 interviews and 22 h of classroom observations with British students (aged 11 – 14) from Black Caribbean, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian and Chinese ethnic backgrounds, this paper identified five ‘types’ of <b>science</b> participation among minority ethnic students. The five types of <b>science</b> participation emerged from an analysis of students’ <b>science</b> achievement, <b>science</b> aspiration, <b>science</b> interest and <b>science</b> capital. The characteristics of the five types are as follows: <b>Science</b> adverse students have no aspirations towards <b>science</b> and lacked interest, achievement and capital in <b>science.</b> <b>Science</b> intrinsic students have high <b>science</b> aspirations, interest and capital but low <b>science</b> attainment. Students who are <b>science</b> intermediate have some aspirations, interest and capital in <b>science,</b> with average <b>science</b> grades. <b>Science</b> extrinsic students achieve highly in <b>science,</b> have some <b>science</b> capital but lacked <b>science</b> aspirations and/or interest. <b>Science</b> prominent students are high <b>science</b> achievers with <b>science</b> aspirations, high levels of interest and capital in <b>science.</b> The findings highlight that minority ethnic students participate in <b>science</b> in diverse ways. Policy implications are suggested for each type as this paper provides empirical evidence to counter against public (and even some academic) discourses of minority ethnic students as a homogeneous group...|$|R
