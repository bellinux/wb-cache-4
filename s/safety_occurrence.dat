40|$|In early 2009, the Contributing Factors Framework (CFF), {{a manual}} {{providing}} a data {{set for the}} coding of systemic factors contributing to rail safety occurrences, was introduced nationally to the rail industry in Australia. It was developed specifically for the rail industry, endorsed by the Rail Safety Regulators’ Panel, and developed by a working group made up of representatives from Australian Rail Safety Regulators, industry and investigation bodies. The CFF aligns with current systemic <b>safety</b> <b>occurrence</b> investigation models (Bird & Germain, 1985; Reason, 1990 b) and was developed to capture and code information about all factors that {{may have contributed to}} a rail <b>safety</b> <b>occurrence.</b> The three main coding headings used in the CFF to capture this information are: Individual/Team Actions; Technical Failures; and Local Conditions & Organisational Factors. Whilst the CFF captured contributing factors under these three stand-alone headings, this research is interested in modelling the previously unseen non-linear network interactions and relationships of all the contributing factors across these three major headings. It is also interested in looking at the strength of the relationships amongst the contributing factors as a more complex systems oriented way of understanding accident taxonomy. The aim of the research program is to develop a method that identifies the trends, patterns and relationships, through accident modelling, of the unique interaction of Copyright © Karen Klockner 2015 iv factors that contribute the most to different types of rail safety occurrences. To obtain the data necessary for this accident modelling to occur, major rail <b>safety</b> <b>occurrence</b> reports have been analysed for the 5 year period 2006 to 2010 using the CFF tool. The contributing factors for sub-types of major rail safety occurrences were modelled, including: 1) Collisions, 2) Derailments, 3) Safe Working Breaches, and 4) Signals Passed at Danger. This research began by reviewing the contributing factors data from a traditional linear analysis, and then progressed {{to the use of the}} newly developed Safety And Failure Event Network (SAFE-Net) methodology to investigate how the contributing factors are interlinked, and to further show the contribution that the factors have on accident phenomenology. The visualisation of the network metrics reveals important properties about the individual contributing factors in the network. This can allow a risk management focus to be directed to mitigating the main contributing factors with a view to controlling and breaking the identified relationships that seem to be present in typical, and all too often reoccurring, railway <b>safety</b> <b>occurrence</b> scenarios. The outcome of this project has been the development of a new methodology for accident modelling called SAFE-Net. The SAFE-Net method has been shown to generate an accident model for each of the various railway safety occurrences under investigation. This is in keeping with the recent call for modern day accident models to be representative of actual accident phenomenology, and to better represent the complex socio-technical systems in which they occur. The SAFE-Net methodology is able to show where maximum benefit can be obtained by directing preventative measures towards those combinations of contributing factors which are having the most influence, in an attempt to prevent the reoccurrence of that type of event. For the first time, contributing factors can be understood as a network of interacting factors and safety improvements can be made by focusing on the critical co-occurrence of various factors discovered across multiple occurrences. The method provides an original means of understanding the complexity of human factors and technical systems that are instrumental in causing safety occurrences...|$|E

This paper presents a new agent-based organizational modelling approach for integrated and systematic evaluation of material and immaterial characteristics of socio-technical organizations in safety culture analysis. It uniquely considers both the formal organization and the value- and belief-driven behaviour of individuals in the organization. Results are presented of a model for <b>safety</b> <b>occurrence</b> reporting at an air navigation service provider. Model predictions consistent with questionnaire-based results are achieved. A sensitivity analysis provides insight in organizational factors that strongly influence safety culture indicators. The modelling approach can be used in combination with attitude-focused safety culture research, towards an integrated evaluation of material and immaterial characteristics of socio-technical organizations. By using this approach an organization is able to gain a deeper understanding of causes of diverse problems and inefficiencies both in the formal organization and in the behaviour of organizational agents, and to systematically identify and evaluate improvement options. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The major {{constraint}} {{in developing}} appropriate monitoring methodologies and tools {{to assess the}} level of safety in en-route airspaces where controllers monitor air traffic by means of radar surveillance and provide aircraft with tactical instructions lies in the estimation of the operational risk.

The data was collected from a 10 -year period, 2006 to 2015, conveniently sourced from a limited population owing to the scarcity of reports. Results indicate that <b>safety</b> <b>occurrences</b> involving Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) have a significantly different distribution of contributing factors when sorted into distinct categories. This provides a thorough and up-to-date characterization of the safety deficiencies specific to RPAS.

A Maintenance Behaviour Questionnaire (MBQ) was developed to explore patterns of unsafe acts committed by aircraft maintenance mechanics. The MBQ was completed anonymously by over 1300 Australian aviation mechanics, who also provided information on their involvement in workplace accidents and incidents. Four factors were identified: routine violations, skill-based errors, mistakes and exceptional violations. Violations and mistakes were related significantly to the occurrence of incidents that jeopardized the quality of aircraft maintenance, but were not related to workplace injuries. Skill-based errors, while not related to work quality incidents, were related to workplace injuries. The results are consistent with the three-way typology of unsafe acts described by Reason et al. (1990) and with the DBQ research indicating an association between self-reported violations and accidents. The current findings suggest that interventions addressed at maintenance quality incidents should take into account the role of violations and mistakes, and the factors that promote them.

40|$|Background: In the Australian rail industry, safety {{performance}} data are currently collected by accredited rail organisations and {{delivered to the}} Rail Safety Regulator of the relevant jurisdiction. These data are gathered using specified criteria which categorise information about rail <b>safety</b> <b>occurrences</b> in terms of ‘what’ occurred. Information regarding ‘why’ the event occurred is not gathered systematically. The rail industry, in seeking to protect itself from the system failures that lead to incidents and accidents, requires rich information about these failures. Key to achieving this is the conduct of systems investigations. The aggregation of data from these investigations can provide valuable information about system-wide safety issues. Aims: A national project overseen by the Rail Safety Regulators’ Panel (RSRP) developed a “Contributing Factors Framework” (CFF) to capture information on systemic contributors. Method: Human Factors, investigations and rail operations specialists developed the framework based on Reason’s Model of Organisational Accidents. Following road-testing, the framework was released in 2009 with version 2 released in 2011. Results: Aggregated CFF data {{can be used to}} direct efforts to improve safety in organisations.

Whilst accident modelling had certainly progressed through various reiterations since the first simple linear model was developed, the identified gap has been for a practical methodology for undertaking accident modelling which can now cope with modern day system complexity and truly reflect the socio-technical systems under review. The aim of this research was to identify the contributing factors to railway safety occurrences and to examine how contributing factors were interconnected and networked. To meet this aim major railway <b>safety</b> <b>occurrence</b> reports which were submitted to the Rail Safety Regular, for a five year period (2006 – 2010), were analysed and data was collected on the contributing factors using the Contributing Factors Framework (CFF), a human factors tool developed for the rail industry in Australia.

Objective and Setting: To compare sedation {{with a combination}} of propofol plus fentanyl and midazolam plus fentanyl in cirrhotic outpatients undergoing UGIE. Design: A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted between February 2008 and February 2009. Main Outcomes Measurements: Efficacy (proportion of complete procedures using the initial proposed sedation scheme), <b>safety</b> (<b>occurrence</b> of sedation-related complications), and recovery time were measured. Results: Two hundred ten cirrhotic patients referred for UGIE were randomized to 2 groups: midazolam group (0. 05 mg/kg plus fentanyl 50 mu g intravenously) or propofol group (0. 25 mg/kg plus fentanyl 50 mu g intravenously). There were no differences between groups regarding age, sex, weight, etiology of cirrhosis, and Child-Pugh or American Society of Anesthesiologists classification. Sedation with propofol was more efficacious (100 % vs 88. 2 %; P <. 001) and had a shorter recovery time than sedation with midazolam (16. 23 +/- 6. 84 minutes and 27. 40 +/- 17. 19 minutes, respectively; P <. 001). Complication rates were similar in both groups (14 % vs 7. 3 %; P =. 172). Limitations: Single-blind study; sample size. Conclusion: Both sedation schemes were safe in this setting. Sedation with propofol plus fentanyl was more efficacious with a shorter recovery time compared with midazolam plus fentanyl. Therefore, the former scheme is an alternative when sedating cirrhotic patients undergoing UGIE. (Gastrointest Enclose 2011; 73 : 45 - 51.)

40|$|Abstract Background Recently, {{several new}} {{endoscopic}} treatments {{have been used}} to treat patients with Barrett's esophagus with high grade dysplasia. This systematic review aimed to determine the safety and effectiveness of these treatments compared with esophagectomy. Methods A comprehensive literature search was undertaken to identify studies of endoscopic treatments for Barrett's esophagus or early stage esophageal cancer. Information from the selected studies was extracted by two independent reviewers. Study quality was assessed and information was tabulated to identify trends or patterns. Results were pooled across studies for each outcome. <b>Safety</b> (<b>occurrence</b> of adverse events) and effectiveness (complete eradication of dysplasia) were compared across different treatments. Results The 101 studies that met the selection criteria included 8 endoscopic techniques and esophagectomy; only 12 were comparative studies. The quality of evidence was generally low. Methods and outcomes were inconsistently reported. Protocols, outcomes measured, follow-up times and numbers of treatment sessions varied, making it difficult to calculate pooled estimates. The surgical mortality rate was 1. 2 %, compared to 0. 04 % in 2831 patients treated endoscopically (1 death). Adverse events were more severe and frequent with esophagectomy, and included anastomotic leaks (9. 4 %), wound infections (4. 1 %) and pulmonary complications (4. 1 %). Four patients (0. 1 %) treated endoscopically experienced bleeding requiring transfusions. The stricture rate with esophagectomy (5. 3 %) was lower than with porfimer sodium photodynamic therapy (18. 5 %), but higher than aminolevulinic acid (ALA) 60 mg/kg PDT (1. 4 %). Dysphagia and odynophagia varied in frequency across modalities, with the highest rates reported for multipolar electrocoagulation (MPEC). Photosensitivity, an adverse event that occurs only with photodynamic therapy, was experienced by 26. 4 % of patients who received porfimer sodium. Some radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or argon plasma coagulation (APC) studies (used in multiple sessions) reported rates of almost 100 % for complete eradication of dysplasia. But the study methods and findings were not adequately described. The other studies of endoscopic treatments reported similarly high rates of complete eradication. Conclusions Endoscopic treatments offer safe and effective alternatives to esophagectomy for patients with Barrett's esophagus and high grade dysplasia. Unfortunately, shortcomings in the published studies make it impossible to determine the comparative effectiveness of each of the endoscopic treatments. </p...|$|E
40|$|Radiotelephony between {{air traffic}} {{controllers}} and pilots utilises standard phraseology as the medium of communications. Standard phraseology employs specific structure, terminology and pronunciation to ensure effectiveness and accuracy. On occasions when standard phraseology is found insufficient, plain language is used to efficiently relay vital information. By default, English is the designated language of communication between controllers and pilots of international flights. Deviations from the usage of standard phraseology and lack of language proficiency had been identified {{as one of the}} causal factors in <b>safety</b> <b>occurrences.</b> Language deficiencies, specifically of the non-native speakers of the English language, had raised much concern but there is limited information in the area. This research attempted to fill a small segment of this knowledge gap. It was focussed on the usage of standard phraseology and English language in an air traffic control environment involving English Second Language users. Audio data was sourced from routine radiotelephony recordings of ‘live’ air traffic control facilities in Malaysia to capture realistic communications between controllers and pilots in the Terminal Approach Radar, Area Radar and Aerodrome Control environments. A detailed cross sectional investigation of the radiotelephony characteristics, deficiencies and errors of transmitted messages revealed the radiotelephony performances of controllers and pilots in the environments. The recurrence of deviations from standards and occurrence of errors implied the likelihood of such deficiencies taking place. Demographic groups’ descriptions complemented the radiotelephony analyses as background information on language related training. The results were comparative to other similar studies and offered new information on English Second Language speakers in the Air Traffic Control environment.

40|$|Flow sliding of {{submerged}} slopes {{in front}} of dikes affects flood <b>safety.</b> The <b>occurrence</b> of flow sliding may result, sometimes with delay, in a failure mode and consequent flooding. The current safety assessment method for flow sliding does not consider the interaction between flow sliding and failure modes. Therefore {{it is unclear whether}} the safety assessment method is sufficiently safe or too conservative. The thesis presents a method to derive a simple safety assessment and design rule based on a number of advanced probabilistic analyses made for four Dutch cases, in which both flow sliding and the relevant direct failure modes have been incorporated. Two methods for the safety assessment of flow sliding are presented: as separate failure mode and coupled to direct failure modes.
