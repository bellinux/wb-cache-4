5|$|As {{with other}} bird families, {{pelicans}} {{are susceptible to}} a variety of parasites. Specialist feather lice of the genus Piagetella are found in the pouches of all species of pelican, but are otherwise only known from New World and Antarctic cormorants.

Leeches may attach to the vent or sometimes the inside of the pouch. A study of the parasites of the American white pelican found 75 different species, including tapeworms, flukes, flies, fleas, ticks and nematodes. Many of these do little harm, but flies may be implicated in the death of nestlings, particularly if they are weak or unwell, and the <b>soft</b> <b>tick</b> Ornithodoros capensis sometimes causes adults to desert the nest.

40|$|There are {{two major}} groups of ticks: <b>soft</b> <b>ticks</b> and hard ticks. The hard ticks {{comprise}} the prostriate ticks and the metastriate ticks. The mitochondrial (mt) genomes of one species of prostriate tick and two species of metastriate ticks had been sequenced prior to our study. The prostriate tick has the ancestral arrangement of mt genes of arthropods, whereas the two metastriate ticks have rearrangements of eight genes and duplicate control regions. However, the arrangement of genes in the mt genomes of <b>soft</b> <b>ticks</b> had not been studied. We sequenced the mt genomes of two species of <b>soft</b> <b>ticks,</b> Carios capensis and Ornithodoros moubata, and a metastriate tick, Haemaphysalis flava. We found that the <b>soft</b> <b>ticks</b> have the ancestral arrangement of mt genes of arthropods, whereas the metastriate tick, H. flava, shares the rearrangements of mt genes and duplicate control regions {{with the other two}} metastriate ticks that have previously been studied. Our study indicates that gene rearrangements and duplicate control regions in mt genomes occurred once in the most recent common ancestor of metastriate ticks, whereas the ancestral arrangement of arthropods has remained unchanged for over 400 million years in the lineages leading to the <b>soft</b> <b>ticks</b> and the prostriate ticks...|$|R

40|$|Background: West Azerbaijan is {{considered}} as a main region for domestic animal breeding. Due to importance of herd as a main host and ticks as a vector of relapsing fever and CCHF, a comprehensive study was undertaken in the region. Methods: Outdoor, indoor collection as well as ticks stick to the animals' body were collected and identified. The study was conducted during the whole seasons in 2004 - 2005. Results: During four seasons a total of 2728 ticks of two families (Ixodidae and Argasidae) were collected compris­ing 7 genera of 5 hard ticks and two genera of <b>soft</b> <b>ticks</b> including Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma, Rhipicepha­lus, Boophilus and Dermacentor. The <b>soft</b> <b>ticks</b> were Ornithodoros and Argas. These 7 genera included 18 species. The main species were Haemaphysalis inermis, H. punctata, H. sulcata, H. numidiana, H. concinna, Hyalomma mar­gi­natum, Hy. anatolicum, Hy. detritum, Hy. dromedarii, Hy. asiaticum, Hy. schulzei, H. aegyptium, Rhipicephalus bursa, R. sangiuneus, Dermacentor marginatus, Boophilus annulatus, Ornithodoros lahorensis, and Argas persicus. Fre­quency of ticks during different seasons was different. A pyrethroid insecticide, cypermethrin, which is widely used for tick control was tested against <b>soft</b> <b>ticks.</b> The test method was based on WHO recommendation. At the LD 50 level A. persicus needs more concentration than O. lahorensis. Conclusion: Ornithodoros and Argas are the more prevalent <b>soft</b> <b>ticks</b> in the region. Distribution and prevalence of hard ticks was varied in different seasons. Results of this study will provide a clue for vectors of tick-borne diseases in the region for local authorities for implementation of tick control. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{molecular}} {{survey was}} conducted to investigate the presence of pathogenic Borrelia persica species caus­ing the tick borne relapsing fever (TBRF) in Takistan district Qazvin Province, western Iran. Methods: A number of 1021 s oft ticks were collected from 31 villages including previously reported infected and none-infected TBRF cases and individually examined {{for the presence of}} B. persica DNA by conventional PCR target­ing the 16 S rRNA. Results: A total of 1021 <b>soft</b> <b>ticks</b> of three species of Ornithodouros tholozani (120 : 11. 75 %), O. lahorensis (461 : 45. 15 %) and Argas persicus (440 : 43. 1 %) were collected and tested against Borrelia infection. <b>Soft</b> <b>ticks</b> were more preva­lent (67 %) in infected areas than none infected areas. The rate O. tholozani in infected areas was much greater (29 times) than none infected areas. Ninety seven percent of <b>soft</b> <b>ticks</b> in none infected areas were of O. tholozani. Six­teen (16. 7 %) ticks of tested (n= 95) O. tholozani were infected with B. persica. Three (1. 3 %) out of 205 <b>soft</b> <b>ticks</b> of O. lahorensis were positive for Borrelia sp., and no infection was observed in A. persicus. Taq I RFLP analysis and se­quence analysis of the positive PCR products showed the presence of B. persica. The RFLP analysis showed that the positive ticks of O. lahorensis were infected with unknown Borrelia species. Conclusion: This study showed that although there were no TBRF cases in Takisan, but still infected O. tholozani, the known vector of TBRF, presented in the region.

50|$|African {{swine fever}} virus (ASFV) is the causative agent of African swine fever (ASF).

50|$|Other genera with {{species that}} are often of high local {{importance}} to domestic animals include these examples: Ixodes (Ixodes ricinus, the deer tick of Europe; Ixodes scapularis, the black-legged tick of North America; Ixodes holocyclus, the paralysis tick of Australia). Haemaphysalis (Ha. leachii, the yellow dog tick of the tropics). Dermacentor (Dermacentor andersoni, the Rocky Mountain wood tick; Dermacentor variabilis, the American dog tick; D. reticulatus, the ornate dog tick of Europe). Dermacentor nitens the tropical horse tick of the Americas has a one-host lifecycle similar to the boophilids. Margaropus winthemi, the beady-legged tick, infests horses and cattle in South Africa. The <b>soft</b> <b>tick</b> Otobius megnini, the spinose ear tick, has its nymphs feeding within the ear canal of many species of domestic animals. Adults of Ot. megnini do not feed. This tick occurs in the Americas and has spread to Africa and Asia.|$|E
50|$|Ornithodoros savignyi aka Sand tampan or African eyed tampan or Kalahari sand tampan, {{is one of}} some 37 {{species in}} the genus Ornithodoros and is a <b>soft</b> <b>tick</b> with a leathery, mammillated integument, causing {{paralysis}} and tampan toxicosis, two unrelated conditions. The sand tampan is an ectoparasite on humans, their livestock and wild animals, including birds and bats. Occurring in semi-desert areas of Africa, Saudi Arabia {{and other parts of}} the Persian Gulf, India, Sri Lanka and into Asia, it is able to survive for lengthy periods without feeding, spending most of its life burrowed under sand or loose soil, often in wait for animals that rest or sleep under trees or in the lee of rocks, but also in places where people or their animals congregate such as marketplaces, places of worship, cattle kraals and village squares. The timing of its activity is geared to coincide with that of potential hosts, but hot sunny conditions are usually avoided. Because of its habit of feeding and dropping from its host, adult dispersal is limited, whereas larvae may remain attached to their hosts for several days. During its life cycle it will feed on multiple hosts between moults.|$|E
40|$|Savicalin, is a lipocalin {{found in}} the hemocytes of the <b>soft</b> <b>tick,</b> Ornithodoros savignyi. It could be {{assigned}} to the tick lipocalin family based on BLAST analysis. Savicalin is the first non-salivary gland lipocalin described in ticks. The mature sequence is composed of 188 amino acids with a molecular mass of 21481. 9 Da. A homolog for savicalin {{was found in a}} whole body EST-library from a related <b>soft</b> <b>tick</b> O. porcinus, while other tick salivary gland derived lipocalins retrieved from the non-redundant sequence database are more distantly related. Homology modeling supports the inclusion of savicalin into the lipocalin family. The model as well as multiple alignments suggests the presence of five disulphide bonds. Two conserved disulphide bonds are found in hard and <b>soft</b> <b>tick</b> lipocalins. A third disulphide bond is shared with the TSGP 4 -clade of leukotriene C 4 binding <b>soft</b> <b>tick</b> lipocalins and a fourth is shared with a lipocalin from the hard tick Ixodes scapularis. The fifth disulphide bond is unique and links strands D-E. Phylogenetic analysis showed that savicalin is a distant relative of salivary gland derived lipocalins, but groups within a clade that is possibly non-salivary gland derived. It lacks the biogenic amine-binding motif associated with tick histamine and serotonin binding proteins. Expression profiles indicate that savicalin is found in hemocytes, midgut and ovaries, but not in the salivary glands. Up-regulation occurs in hemocytes after bacterial challenge and in midguts and ovaries after feeding. Given its tissue distribution and up-regulation of expression, it is possible that this lipocalin functions in tick development after feeding or in an anti-microbial capacity.

40|$|Ticks, {{belonging}} to the <b>soft</b> <b>ticks</b> species Ornithodorus sonrai, have been collected from six sites in Senegal and were tested {{for the presence of}} Bartonella spp. Initial screening by PCR revealed the presence of these bacteria in ticks from two villages, Soulkhou Thisse (5 / 8, 62. 5 %) and Maka Gouye (1 / 24, 4. 2 %). Three bacterial strains were isolated from live ticks, and the genetic characterization of these strains suggests that they belong to two previously unknown species. The pathogenicity of these two new species of Bartonella is not yet known.

40|$|African {{swine fever}} {{is a highly}} {{contagious}} disease of pigs in Africa. Although its persistence in Senegal {{may be caused by}} asymptomatic carriers involved in the domestic transmission cycle, we demonstrated that the <b>soft</b> <b>tick</b> Ornithodoros sonrai can be naturally infected with the causative agent. African swine fever (ASF) {{is one of the most}} severe diseases of pigs in Africa. It is caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV), an Asfaviridae virus, and usually results in acute hemorrhagic fever in susceptible animals with mortality rates up to 100 % in some herds (1). ASF is defined by the World Organization for Animal Health as a highly contagious disease that can spread rapidly and have serious socioeconomic effects in international trade of pigs or pig products and food security. No treatment or vaccine is currently available, and control is essentially based on sanitary measures (1). ASF is endemic in eastern and southern Africa, where ASFV is maintained either in a sylvatic cycle between warthogs (Phacochoerus aethiopicus) or bushpigs (Potamochoerus spp.) and <b>soft</b> <b>tick</b> vectors of the Ornithodoros moubata complex or in a domestic cycle that involves pigs of local breeds with or without tick involvement (2 – 4). Long-term persistence of ASFV caused by the presence of the <b>soft</b> <b>tick</b> vector O. erraticus (5) has also been reported in the Iberian Peninsula. In west Africa, ASFV has been introduced several times since the 1970 s in different countries by importing infected pigs or meat. These imports resulted in massive sporadic outbreaks that have been eradicated (6). Senegal has had several outbreaks caused by regular reemergence of ASFV since its first description in 1959, which suggests a unique epidemiology that has not been reported in most west African countries infected with ASFV (6). The presence of warthogs (7) and the <b>soft</b> <b>tick</b> O. sonrai (8) in Senegal suggest a sylvatic cycle of ASF. O. sonrai is closely related to O. erraticus and the O. moubata complex and shares similar vector competence for some pathogens, such as Borrelia, which causes human relapsing fever in Africa (9). This article reports preliminary results on potential involvement of O. sonrai in persistence and transmission of ASFV and discusses the role of reservoirs or vectors in control measures...|$|E

50|$|The Ixodidae are {{the family}} of hard ticks, {{one of the two}} big {{families}} of ticks, consisting of over 700 species. They are known as 'hard ticks' because they have a scutum or hard shield, which the other big family of <b>ticks,</b> the <b>soft</b> <b>ticks</b> (Argasidae), lack. They are ectoparasites {{of a wide range of}} host species, and some are vectors of disease.|$|R
50|$|Argasidae <b>soft</b> <b>ticks</b> have {{different}} lifecycles from Ixodidae hard ticks, {{and these are}} very variable between species. 1 Typically, in Ornithodoros, a larva hatches from an egg laid in the nest or resting place of the host. The larva does not feed, but directly molts into the first nymph stage. This stage feeds then molts into the next nymph stage. Feeding by <b>soft</b> <b>ticks</b> is generally completed within minutes rather than days as with hard ticks. Depending on circumstances, four or five nymph stages occur, each progressively larger. Finally, a molt produces an adult female or male. The female takes repeated blood meals that are small compared to a female hard tick. Each blood meal is converted to a small batch of eggs. The male feeds sufficiently to support its mating. The lifecycle of Argas persicus is similar, but the larva feeds on blood of its bird host, remaining attached around 7 days.|$|R
40|$|The <b>soft</b> <b>tick</b> Ornithodoros hermsi, which ranges in {{specific}} arboreal zones of western North America, {{acts as a}} vector for the relapsing fever spirochete Borrelia hermsii. Two genomic groups (genomic group I [GGI] and GGII) of B. hermsii are differentiated by multilocus sequence typing yet are codistributed {{in much of the}} vector's range. To test whether the tick vector can be infected via immersion, noninfected, colony-derived O. hermsi larvae were exposed to reduced-humidity conditions before immersion in culture suspensions of several GGI and GGII isolates. We tested for spirochetes in ticks by immunofluorescence microscopy and in mouse blood by quantitative PCR of the vtp locus to differentiate spirochete genotypes. The immersed larval ticks were capable of spirochete transmission to mice at the first nymphal feeding. Tick infection with mixed cultures of isolates DAH (vtp- 6) (GGI) and MTW- 2 (vtp- 5) (GGII) resulted in ticks that caused spirochetemias in mice consisting of MTW- 2 or both DAH and MTW- 2. These findings show that this <b>soft</b> <b>tick</b> species can acquire B. hermsii by immersion in spirochete suspensions, that GGI and GGII isolates can coinfect the tick vector by this method, and that these spirochetes can be cotransmitted to a rodent host...|$|E

40|$|Endosymbiosis in {{arthropods}} involves intracellular {{bacteria that}} supply {{an array of}} benefits to the host. Endosymbionts likely enhance the health of ticks by provisioning amino acids such as cysteine and tyrosine, and cofactors such as biotin and folic acid that are not available in blood [...] the sole nutrient source of ticks. Endosymbionts of ticks are of special interest due to their close evolutionary relationship with tick-vectored pathogens that impact livestock and human health. For example, ticks typically contain Coxiella-like endosymbionts (CLEs) that are the closest relatives of the human pathogen Coxiella burnetii. In {{order to understand the}} evolutionary relationship between the mammalian pathogen Francisella tularensis, which is vectored by ticks, and the Francisella-like endosymbionts (FLEs) present in several ticks, we assembled the genomes of the FLEs in the hard tick Amblyomma maculatum and the <b>soft</b> <b>tick</b> Ornithodoros moubata using high-throughput sequencing. While this project was in progress, another group described the genome of an FLE in the <b>soft</b> <b>tick</b> Argus (Persicargas) arboreus. Utilizing the three genomes, we show that all FLEs evolved from a mammalian pathogen, a relationship that is converse to that of C. burnetii, which likely evolved from a tick-associated non-pathogenic ancestor. Additionally, our analyses indicate that FLEs are horizontally transferred between ticks, and due to their superior metabolic capabilities could replace ancestral endosymbionts with reduced genomes...|$|E
