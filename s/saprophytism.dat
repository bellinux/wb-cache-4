40|$|We {{developed}} {{a model of}} the population dynamic interaction between an insect and a pathogenic bacterium motivated by study of Serratia entomophila, a commercially exploited pathogen of the New Zealand grass grub (Costelytra zealandica). The bacterium is able to reproduce saprophytically, though it competes for saprophytic substrates with non-pathogenic strains, which appear to be superior competitors, probably because they lack a plasmid that carries genes required for pathogenicity. The effect of <b>saprophytism</b> and competition on the invasion criterion (R 0), short-term dynamics and long-term dynamics are described. <b>Saprophytism</b> can reduce (possibly to zero) the host threshold at which the pathogen can invade, though this reduction is less when there is competition with non-pathogenic strains. In a model of short-term population dynamics designed to mimic the application of bacteria to a host epizootic, <b>saprophytism</b> enhances the reduction in host density, though again this is tempered by competition with non-pathogens. In the long term, a pathogen that can develop saprophytically can drive its host to extinction in the absence of competition with non-pathogens. When the latter are present, host extinction is prevented. The addition of saprophytic reproduction can stabilize an otherwise unstable host–pathogen model, but we were unable to find a stable equilibrium given the further addition of a wholly saprophytic bacterial strain. The model suggests that enhancing or selecting for saprophytic ability could be a way of improving biological control...|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} enzymatic {{activity}} {{is of great}} importance in the immunology of fungi.

The authors used Saprolegnia cultures to analyse soluble antigenic fractions arising from the mycelium of cultures of 4 species of Saprolegnia, which are found most frequently in the parasitic state on fish: S. parasitica, S. ferax, S. delica, S. diclina.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{absence of}} <b>saprophytism</b> in freshly isolated strains of Bacillus abortus is conveniently measured by inoculating {{a series of}} agar tubes with. successive dilutions of culture and sealing the tubes. The appearance of films of growth is delayed from 3 to 17 days and suppressed {{with the increase in}} the dilutions. As many as 100, 000 bacteria per sq. cm. of agar surface are suppressed. When the confined air contains CO 2 in a concentration as low as ¼ per cent and up to 10 per cent, the inhibition and suppression do not occur. Concentrations down to 0. 1 per cent are still capable, even though in a slightly retarded manner, of bringing high dilutions into growth.

These bacteria are widely but heterogeneously distributed in the natural environment, such as soil, water and rhizosphere. Bcc strains are able to colonize various ecological niches by adopting versatile lifestyles, including <b>saprophytism</b> and (positive or deleterious) association with eukaryotic cells.

However, they also are important opportunistic pathogens that can cause severe respiratory infections among individuals suffering from cystic fibrosis or chronic granulomatous disease. Therefore, considering that the distinction between plant beneficial and clinical strains is not obvious, biotechnological applications of Bcc strains are currently not allowed.

40|$|The fungus Corynespora cassiicola is an {{important}} pathogen that causes necrotic lesions in several plant species. <b>Saprophytism</b> and parasitism habits of plants are common survival strategies for this pathogen. Few studies referred {{to the formation of}} chlamydospores by C. cassiicola. The objective {{of this study was to}} test the formation of chlamydospores by several C. cassiicola isolates from different agronomic crops and weeds. Fifteen isolates were analysed by in vivo and in vitro tests. Six isolates from four host plants (Cucumis sativus, Lantana camara, Malpighia glabra and Vernonia cinerea) were able to produce chlamydospores, both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, chlamydospore production was highest for the Malpighia glabra isolate and one Cucumis sativus isolate, intermediate for two other C. sativus isolates, and lowest for the Vernonia cinerea and Lantana camara isolates. However, no difference in the relative number of chlamydospores produced among isolates was observed in vivo. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Among fungi, {{the basic}} life {{strategies}} are <b>saprophytism,</b> parasitism, and predation. Fungi in Orbiliaceae (Ascomycota) prey on animals {{by means of}} specialized trapping structures. Five types of trapping devices are recognized, but their evolutionary origins and divergence are not well understood. Based on comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences of three protein-coding genes (RNA polymerase II subunit gene, rpb 2; elongation factor 1 -α gene, ef 1 -α; and ß tubulin gene, bt) and ribosomal DNA in the internal transcribed spacer region, we have demonstrated that the initial trapping structure evolved along two lineages yielding two distinct trapping mechanisms: one developed into constricting rings and the other developed into adhesive traps. Among adhesive trapping devices, the adhesive network separated from the others early and evolved at a steady and gentle speed. The adhesive knob evolved through stalk elongation, with a final development of nonconstricting rings. Our {{data suggest that the}} derived adhesive traps are at a highly differentiated stage. The development of trapping devices is felicitous proof of adaptive evolution...|$|E
40|$|The Zygomycetes {{includes}} {{a number of}} mycoparasitic genera, which differ in their strategies of parasitism. Piptocephalis, Dispira, Dimargaris and Tieghemiomyces are typical biotrophs, and display many features associated with this mode of infection, such as the formation of haustoria. Dicranophora, Spinellus and Sylgiles, on the other hand, apparently form necrotrophic associations with moribund toadstools, although {{it is difficult to}} define the boundary between mycoparasitism and competitive <b>saprophytism.</b> There are also zygomycetes, such as Chaetocladium and Syncephalis, which have modes of infection which do not fit neatly into either category above, but apparently share necrotrophic and biotrophic characteristics. Initially the infection process of Syncephalis resembles that of Piptocephalis, but it is followed by a rapid internal growth of parasitic hyphae and concomitant destruction of host cytoplasm. Chaetocladium forms gall-like structures on suitable host fungi and its growth is enhanced by this association. Circumstantial evidence suggests that these galls are functionally different from those formed by Parasitella during a pseudo-sexual response to the presence of another fungus. Zygomycetes also act as hosts for several other mycoparasitic fungi...|$|E
40|$|Virulence of the fungal {{pathogen}} Aspergillus fumigatus {{is in part}} {{based on}} the saprophytic lifestyle that this mold has evolved. A crucial function for <b>saprophytism</b> resides in secreted proteases that allow assimilation of proteinaceous substrates. The impact of extracellular proteolytic activities on the pathogenesis of aspergillosis, however, remains controversial. In order to address this issue, characterization of a conserved regulatory factor, PrtT, that acts on expression of secreted proteases was pursued. Expression of PrtT appears to be regulated posttranscriptionally, {{and the existence of}} an mRNA leader sequence implies translational control via eIF 2 kinase signaling. Phenotypic classification of a prtT deletion mutant revealed that expression of several major extracellular proteases is PrtT dependent, resulting in the inability to utilize protein as a nutritional source. Certain genes encoding secreted proteases are not regulated by PrtT. Most strikingly, the deletant strain is not attenuated in virulence when tested in a leukopenic mouse model, which makes a strong case for reconsidering any impact of secreted proteases in pulmonary aspergillosis. Diseases caused by the fungal pathogens of the genus As-pergillus represent a growing and clinically relevant threat in distinct medical settings (31).

40|$|Select {{species of}} the {{bacterial}} genus Leptospira are causative agents of leptospirosis, an emerging global zoonosis affecting nearly one million people worldwide annually. We examined two Leptospira pathogens, L. interrogans serovar Lai str. 56601 and L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo-bovis str. L 550, {{as well as the}} free-living leptospiral saprophyte, L. biflexa serovar Patoc str. 'Patoc 1 (Ames) '. The transport proteins of these leptospires were identified and compared through bioinformatics to determine which proteins are related to pathogenesis, and <b>saprophytism.</b> L. biflexa possesses a disproportionately high number of secondary carriers for metabolic uptake flexibility and environmental adaptability, as well as an increased number of inorganic cation transporters providing ionic homeostasis and effective osmoregulation in a rapidly changing environment. L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii possess remarkably similar transporter proteomes (transportomes), with near-equivalent representation in most transporter families. The Leptospira pathogens possess complete sphingomyelinases, holins, and virulent outer membrane porins. These transport-related virulence factors, in conjunction with decreased transporter substrate versatility, indicates that pathogenicity arose in Leptospira as a result of progressively narrowing ecological niches and the emergence of a limited set of proteins responsible for host invasion. The variability of host tropism and mortality rates by infectious leptospires suggests that small differences in individual sets of proteins play important physiological and morphological role...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFungi are {{a highly}} complex group of organisms {{of the kingdom}} Eumycota (i. e. the true-fungi) and other fungus-like organisms {{traditionally}} studied by mycologists, such as slime molds (Myxomycota) and oomycota (Straminopiles or Heterokonts). They constitute {{a significant proportion of}} the as yet undiscovered biota that is crucial in ecological processes and human well-being, through at least three main trophic modes: <b>saprophytism,</b> parasitism, or symbiosis. In addition to direct benefit (sources of antibiotics) or adverse effects (agents of disease), fungi can impact many environmental processes, particularly those associated with the decomposition of organic matter. They are present in almost all regions and climates, even under extreme conditions. However, studies have focussed mostly on economically interesting species, and knowledge of their diversity and functions is mainly restricted to soil, rhizosphere, mangrove, and lotic ecosystems. In this study, we review the diversity and potential functions of microscopic fungi in aquatic ecosystems, with focus on the pelagic environments where they often are regarded as allochthonous material, of low ecological significance for food-web processes. Recent environmental 18 S rDNA surveys of microbial eukaryotes have (1) unveiled a large reservoir of unexpected fungal diversity in pelagic systems, (2) emphasized their ecological potentials for ecosystem functioning, and (3) opened new perspectives in the context of food-web dynamics. In spite of persisting methodological difficulties, we conclude that a better documentation of the diversity and quantitative and functional importance of fungi will improve our understanding of pelagic processes and biogeochemical cycling...|$|E
40|$|The role of fungal endophytes (FEs) as "pioneer" {{decomposers}} {{has recently}} been recognized; however, {{the extent to which}} FEs contribute to litter loss is less well understood. The genetic and enzymatic bases of FE-mediated decomposition have also rarely been addressed. The effects of populations and individuals (with an emphasis on two dominant Lophodermium taxa) of FEs on needle-litter decomposition were assessed for Pinus massoniana, a ubiquitous pine in southern China. Data from in vivo (microcosm) experiments indicated that the percentage of litter-mass loss triggered by FEs was linearly correlated with incubation time and approached 60 % after seven months. In vitro decomposition tests also confirmed that endophytic Lophodermium isolates caused 14 - 22 % mass loss within two months. Qualitative analysis of exoenzymes (cellulase and laccase, important for lignocellulose degradation) revealed that almost all of the Lophodermium isolates showed moderate or strong positive reactions. Furthermore, partial sequences of β-glucosidase (glycoside hydrolase family 3, GH 3), laccase, and cellobiohydrolase (GH 7) genes were amplified from Lophodermium isolates as "functional markers" to evaluate their potential for lignocellulolytic activity. Three different genes were detected, suggesting a flexible and delicate decomposition system rich in FEs. Our work highlights the possibility that the <b>saprophytism</b> and endophytism of FEs may be prerequisites to initiating rapid decomposition and thus may be key in Fes' contribution to litter decomposition, at least in the early stage. Potential indicators of the presence of core fungal decomposers are also briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{presents}} an original rDNA PCR and microscopic survey of pelagic freshwater fungal communities, and {{was designed to}} unveil the diversity of true Fungi (i. e. the kingdom Eumycota) in three contrasting lake ecosystems (Lakes Pavin, Aydat and Vassivière) located in the French Massif Central. Three clone libraries were constructed from samples collected in the euphotic layers of the lakes during spring 2007. Phylogenetic analysis of the combined data from the three lakes clustered our sequences into thee divisions: Chytridiomycota (50 % of total sequences), Ascomycota (40 %) and Basidiomycota (10 % in Pavin and Aydat only). Several sequences were assigned to a novel Chytridiomycota clade first recovered in Lake Pavin in 2005. Most of the sequences retrieved in the investigated lakes were affiliated with known fungal species, {{most of which were}} apparently well adapted to thrive in the pelagic realm. Their main functions (i. e. parasitism and <b>saprophytism),</b> putatively inferred from the closest relatives of the retrieved molecular sequences, were confirmed by microscopic approaches and by enrichment experiments with pollen grains. The occurrence of three fungal forms (zoosporic, yeast and mycelial) was associated with different trophic modes, establishing fungi as strong potential competitors for various niches in pelagic ecosystems, primarily in relation to the processing of particulate organic matter and the production of propagule food sources for grazers. For the first time, this study provides insight into the diversity and the associated functions of all members of the Kingdom Eumycota investigated in the whole plankton fraction of aquatic ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to cytokines, CD 4 + T cells {{have been found}} to secrete soluble, T-cell-derived antigen binding molecules (TABMs). These antigen-specific immunoproteins are thought to have immunoregulatory properties in the suppression of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) because they often associate with interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) and transforming growth factor beta. Decreased CMI causes susceptibility to infections caused by organisms which are normally nonpathogenic. In this situation, e. g., Candida albicans <b>saprophytism</b> may develop into invasive candidiasis. The difficult diagnosis of invasive candidiasis is based on the findings obtained from blood cultures and with tissue biopsy specimens, with some additional diagnostic value gained by the detection of Candida albicans mannan antigenemia and antimannan antibodies. In the present study, Candida albicans mannan-specific TABM (CAM-TABM) levels in the sera of patients with invasive candidiasis (n = 11), Candida colonization (n = 11) and noncolonization (n = 10), recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (n = 30), and atopic eczema dermatitis syndrome (n = 59) and healthy controls (n = 30) were analyzed. For 14 participants, the effect of mannan stimulation on TABM production and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and IL- 4 mRNA expression by peripheral blood lymphocytes was also studied. It was demonstrated that CAM-TABM production was the highest in patients with invasive candidiasis and that CAM-TABM levels could distinguish Candida-colonized patients from noncolonized patients. In addition, the CAM-TABM level was directly related to mRNA expression for IL- 4 but not IFN-γ. These results reinforce the view that TABMs are associated with decreased CMI, immunoregulation, and the T-helper cell 2 -type immune response...|$|E
40|$|Flavobacterium columnare is a {{bacterial}} pathogen {{of fresh water}} fish causing lethal columnaris disease worldwide. At Finnish fish farms, columnaris disease has occurred since the early 1980 s, and {{is a serious problem}} in salmonid farming in Finland. Currently, the only effective treatment is with antibiotics. Factors related to the pathogenicity of F. columnare, transmission of columnaris disease and the immunity of salmonids to columnaris infections are poorly known. F. columnare strains isolated from Finnish fish farms were characterized geno- and phenotypically, virulence and transmission experiments were conducted, and the efficacy of two immunostimulants against columnaris infections in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum) fingerlings was evaluated. Finnish F. columnare strains constituted a genetically homogeneous group that differed from strains isolated {{from other parts of the}} world and tolerated narrower pH and salinity ranges than F. columnare type strain (NCIMB 2248 T). Finnish strains could be divided into seven genetic groups, which can co-occur during the same outbreak at fish farms. Among the genetic groups, four colony types were formed. Formation of rhizoid colonies is suggested to be a prerequisite for virulence of F. columnare. Colony types may have a role in the infection process and persistence of F. columnare at fish farms. The bacterium was able to survive in fresh water and also as a saprophyte, and to use <b>saprophytism</b> as a transmission strategy. These properties, together with co-occurrence of different genetic groups, may promote the continuous nature of outbreaks at fish farms and lead to development of highly virulent F. columnare strains. Immunostimulation was effective in boosting innate immune defence parameters of rainbow trout, but was inefficient in protecting fish against F. columnare infections. This suggests that antibody-mediated immunity is also essential in protecting fish from columnaris disease...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{aspect of}} the epidemiology and pathogenicity of the soil-borne phase of Rhizoctonia solani AG- 3 (Kuhn) fungus on potatoes and its competitive saprophytic colonisation ability in the soil. Under controlled environmental conditions, stem canker incidence and severity increased with increasing levels of soil-borne inoculum but plateaued after ¼ inoculum level (i. e 1 Petri dish of R. solani  AG- 3 per kg soil).   Up to the 1 / 20 inoculum stem canker occurred at a low level.   A significant increase occurred at 1 / 10 and 1 / 8 inoculum levels.   A similar pattern was observed for the competitive saprophytic colonisation ability of the fungus.   The fungus was attracted more by seed tubers than by stems and the incidence of black scurf was higher than stem canker at all inoculum levels tested.   Sclerotia developed on seed tubers even at low inoculum levels.   Favourable soil conditions for infection on stems and seed tubers were 10 o C and soil moisture content of 40 % water holding capacity.   Optimum moisture content for <b>saprophytism</b> was between 20 - 50 % water holding capacity, although optimum levels of the individual soils tested varied.   Pot and laboratory experiments indicated that conditions for development of R. solani were more conducive in heavy than in light textured soils.   When fine sand was added in increasing quantities to a sandy clay loam soil, the disease initiated by the fungus was steadily reduced {{with an increase in}} sand content.   Potato cultivars differed in their susceptibility to R. solani at early stages of growth but  none of the cultivars tested showed complete resistance to the disease.   Depth of planting had no significant effect of Rhizoctonia stem and seed tuber infection.

This work was supported by funds from the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (Plant Health and the Environment Division), the French National Research Agency (ANR- 12 -ADAP- 0014 - 01) and the French Laboratory of Excellence project TULIP (ANR- 10 -LABX- 41). The complete collections of events generated for all the clones from this study {{are available on the}} Microscope platform ([URL] SYMPA tag). Ecological transitions between different lifestyles, such as pathogenicity, mutualism and <b>saprophytism,</b> have been very frequent in the course of microbial evolution, and often driven by horizontal gene transfer. Yet, how genomes achieve the ecological transition initiated by the transfer of complex biological traits remains poorly known. Here we used experimental evolution, genomics, transcriptomics and high-resolution phenotyping to analyze the evolution of the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum into legume symbionts, following the transfer of a natural plasmid encoding the essential mutualistic genes. We show that a regulatory pathway of the recipient R. solanacearum genome involved in extracellular infection of natural hosts was reused to improve intracellular symbiosis with the Mimosa pudica legume. Optimization of intracellular infection capacity was gained through mutations affecting two components of a new regulatory pathway, the transcriptional regulator efpR and a region upstream from the RSc 0965 - 0967 genes of unknown functions. Adaptive mutations caused the downregulation of efpR and the over-expression of a downstream regulatory module, the three unknown genes RSc 3146 - 3148, two of which encoding proteins likely associated to the membrane. This over-expression led to important metabolic and transcriptomic changes and a drastic qualitative and quantitative improvement of nodule intracellular infection. In addition, these adaptive mutations decreased the virulence of the original pathogen. The complete efpR/RSc 3146 - 3148 pathway could only be identified in the genomes of the pathogenic R. solanacearum species complex. Our findings illustrate how the rewiring of a genetic network regulating virulence allows a radically different type of symbiotic interaction and contributes to ecological transitions and trade-offs...|$|E
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes, the causative {{agent of}} Listeriosis, is a severe {{foodborne}} pathogen {{that can be}} ubiquitously found in the environment and also invading mammalian cells. Its ability {{to survive in the}} environment and in processing plants is of serious concern for the food industry. The continuous emergence of foodborne outbreaks associated with a high mortality is a serious threat to public health. Understanding how the environmental cues enhance the adaptation of L. monocytogenes during saprophytic life is of valuable importance to prevent the infection. To sense and trigger the transition from <b>saprophytism</b> to parasitism, L. monocytogenes integrates a series of signals by means of the transcription factor PrfA. Outside the host, the genes under the control of PrfA are downregulated to maintain the bacterial fitness and are strongly activated during infection. In order to invade the mammalian cells, this pathogen utilises a family of proteins named Internalins (Inls). The Inls promote internalisation, triggering host cell defences. Therefore, avoiding recognition during intracellular infection facilitates cytosolic replication and spread of the bacteria in the host. In this MSc thesis I aimed to shed light on a novel regulatory mechanism that causes the repression of the L. monocytogenes PrfA system. This is part of a wider study, where previous chemical studies conducted in our laboratory determined that the hydrophobic resin Amberlite-XAD causes an upregulation of the listerial virulence in L. monocytogenes via sequestration of phenylalanine (Phe) from the culture medium (BHI). To this end, I defined the effect of Amberlite in the PrfA system during growth in BHI and tested the repressor effect of Phe in a chemical defined media (IMM). I assessed the impact of Phe on PrfA regulon expression during culture in vitro using lux reporter strains and explored the implication of the nutritional regulator CodY. In addition, I also directly measured the effect on virulence gene transcription on L. monocytogenes strains that lack the PrfA positive feedback loop of L. monocytogenes to better understand the mechanism by which the PrfA system is repressed. For these experiments, RNA extraction and QRT-PCR were performed at different stages of the exponential growth of bacteria. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that Phe, an abundant plant metabolite, acts as an environmental signal molecule to repress the PrfA system when L. monocytogenes is living as a soil saprophyte, in a similar way to the plant-derived beta-glucoside sugar cellobiose does. Furthermore, during this MSc thesis I worked in unravelling novel host-pathogen interactors of potential importance during Listeria infection. I conducted an analysis of previous high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screens with the aim of identifying potential host cell proteins likely to interact with the PrfA regulated Inls of L. monocytogenes. The work conducted in this second part of my MSc focussed on establishing and standardising protocols to investigate the co-localization of PrfA-regulated Inl-expressing bacteria and ubiquitin using different combinations of stainings, immunofluorescence and the construction of fluorescent listerias...|$|E
40|$|The Vegetable Kingdom is {{in other}} words the plant world, or the {{aggregate}} of organisms called plants. It is co-ordinate with the animal kingdom, and these two include all forms of organic life on the earth. It {{is not possible to}} define precisely the line which separates the lower portions of these two kingdoms; we may therefore regard them as simply branches of one great group, inseparable below, but widely divergent above. In attempting to separate plants from animals the most we can do is to bring together those characters which separate the greater number of plants from animals, and then to associate with the plants thus set off such of the remaining organisms as appear to be more plant-like than animal. For the most part plants are cells enclosed in walls of cellulose, or aggregates of such cells, all or part of which contain chlorophyll, by means of which they are able to appropriate carbon from inorganic matter (carbon dioxide). The organisms thus set off constitute the bulk of the vegetable kingdom, and characterize its principal divisions. With these typical plants we must associate many which have lost some of their strictly vegetable characteristics through parasitism or <b>saprophytism.</b> Thus the thousands of species of fungi, while destitute of chlorophyll and incapable of appropriating inorganic carbon, are plants nevertheless, and are to be associated with those to which they show some structural similarity. There are now known and described about 175, 000 species of plants on the globe, and recent estimates made by Professor Saccardo show that this is probably less than one-half of the total number. This vast assemblage of organisms requires classification in order that we may study them and communicate our results to others. Accordingly similar species have been gathered into genera, similar genera into families, similar families into orders, etc. Finally we have been able, from a study of these groups, to make generalizations as to their probable relationship, and thus to form a genetic system in which all plants are included in six great BRANCHES, further subdivided into fifteen CLASSES. This system may be graphically represented by the accompanying diagram. In the synopsis of the Flora of Nebraska presented below, the sequence is from primitive or simple forms to those which are derived or more complex. It will be seen by a comparison of the synopsis, with the diagram given above, that many cases occur in which several groups have had a common origin from which they have diverged, their highest forms differing most widely. It follows therefore that in the synopsis we are compelled to return again and again to these common points of origin in order to follow out successively the diverging genetic lines. But it must not be forgotten that the derived forms have suffered degradation, as is notoriously the case with the fungi and other parasitic or saprophytic plants. Here the degraded form is the derived one, and accordingly it must be considered after the primitive form, although the latter may be actually more complex. In the flowering plants we find many cases of progressive simplification in following genetic lines. Grasses and sedges, while in many ways simpler than lilies, are in fact much further from the primitive monocotyledonous type. The oaks and walnuts, the willows and cottonwoods, with flowers, apparently quite simple, must be given positions in a natural system much further removed from the primitive types than many plants with a much more complete floral structure. These principles will account for the unusual position assigned to some of the families in the synopsis. A careful study of the flora of Nebraska shows that not only are all the great BRANCHES of the vegetable kingdom represented, but that of the fifteen CLASSES, fourteen are represented, and that of the fifty-four ORDERS, forty-three are represented, while of the 386 FAMILIES there are representatives of about one-half. On the other hand, of the 175, 000 species of plants now known, probably little, if any, more than two per cent occur within our borders. Branch I. —PROTOPHYTA. Uni- or multicellular plants, single or aggregated into loose clusters, or mechanically united into filaments, often provided with a thick membrane or sheath; filaments or clusters often aggregated into a thallus; true nucleus absent; color generally aeruginous through various shades of red and yellow, but never chlorophyll-green; asexual reproduction typical, by cell-division; sexual reproduction wanting. In some genera variously moclified cells, called spores, are present, and in others peculiarly colored cells, called heterocysts. Both sometimes occur in the same individual. Fresh water or marine algae floating freely, or attached to a substratum, or rarely terrestrial. Chiefly holophytes, but one family, the Bacteriaceae, typically hysterophytic. In the more primitive forms propagation takes place by means of fission, the resulting cells continuing as independent plants. In others the resulting cells remain in loose clusters, attached by mutual compression or imbedded in a gelatinous matrix, or in the higher forms united into a multicellular filament. It is probable that the Protophytes and the chlorophyll-bearing algae have developed in different directions from the same point. Chroococcus and Gloeocapsa on the one hand, and Protococcus and Palmella on the other, represent the most primitive of the respective groups. Nothing definite is known as to the relationship of these forms. Branch II. —PHYCOPHYTA. Uni- or multi-cellular plants; thallus generally filamentous, often stratose, simple, or ramose, chlorophyll-green, or colorless; reproduction sexual and asexual; asexual reproduction by means of fission, by zoospores, or by cysts; sexual reproduction by means of isogametes or heterogametes. Mostly inhabitants of fresh or salt water. A few are terrestrial, however, and several small families are parasitic or saprophytic. One class, Phaeophyceae, is composed of marine algae exclusively, and of course finds no representation in the state. In Protococcus and related genera the phycophytes represent probably the most primitive forms of plant life. On the other hand, however, this branch stands as the great central stock from one part of which the long series of parasites and saprophytes have sprung, and from another the red sea-weeds and stone-worts. Branch III. —CARPOPHYTA. Multicellular plants; plant-body, for the most part, a parenchymatous tissue-aggregate, with or without chlorophyll; vegetative cells typically unmodified, cylindrical, or hexagonal; reproduction sexual and asexual; asexual reproduction in the chlorophyll series chiefly by means of tetraspores, in the hysterophytic series by means of stylospores, chlamydospores, and conidia proper; sexual reproduction by means of carpogones and antherids, resulting in the formation of a sporocarp. Chiefly marine holophytes, or terrestrial hysterophytes. Plant body an undifferentiated aggregate of parenchyma-cells, forming a tissue mass, except in the Perisporiaceae, Oharophyceae and the unicellular Saccharomycetes. Chlorophyll is absent in most of the orders. When present, it is often more or less masked by other substances, as the red and purple coloring matters of the Rhodophyceae and the lime incrustation of the Oharophyceae. Asexual reproduction is typical of but two classes, Ascomycetes and Rhodophyceae. In the former, it results by means of conidia, stylospores, and, more rarely, by chlamydospores; in the latter uniformly by means of tetraspores. The fertilization of the carpogone by the contents of the antherid, typically through the medium of a trichogyne, produces a so-called sporocarp, which is characteristic of the branch. In the Oharophyceae, however, the fertilization does not result in the formation of a sporocarp. In the hysterophytes, moreover, sexuality decreases with the distance from the point of derivation of the group until it finally disappears, {{but at the same time}} without a corresponding modification in the production of the sporocarp. 2 ̆ 7 l 2 ̆ 7 he relationships of the carpophytes are varied, and their inter-relations somewhat obscure. Through the holophytic series they connect in a nearly straight line, the Phycophytes with the Bryophytes, notwithstanding the evident break at the beginning of the series. On the other hand the hysterophytic series, which ends blindly at the upper end, probably falls into two natural divisions, one of which, represented by the Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes, has perhaps had its origin in or near the Peronosporaceae, while the other represented by the Laboulbeniaceae, etc., has its derivation and relationship still involved in great obscurity. Class III. —COLEOCHAETEAE. Small green plants growing attached to submerged stems and leaves; thallus composed of branched rows of cells more or less united laterally into a flat, irregular or circular disk. Reproduction by sexually produced carpospores and asexual swarm-spores (zoogonidia). The terminal cell of a branch which is to produce a carpospore swells, and the upper portion elongates into a narrow tubular process (trichogyne) which opens at the top. At the same time antherids develop from certain cells as small flask-shaped outgrowths, usually three or four from a cell. Each antherid thus formed cuts off from the mother-cell by a transverse wall, and the contents form a single biciliate antherozoid, which escapes and finds its way to the female cell, probably through the trichogyne. After fertilization, the female cell forms a wall around itself inside the old cell-wall, and the whole becomes enveloped by a coating of cells which grows up from below, thus forming a sporocarp with a single carpospore. The Coleochaeteae are related to the Oedogoniaceae on the one hand and to the Florideae on the other. It is possible also that the origin of the great groups of the higher fungi is to be found in some such group as this. The nature and significance of the process of the formation of the sporocarp of the higher fungi has been a fruitful cause of discussion, and it has been commonly thought of late that it had no relation to the carpospore of the Coleochaeteae, or to the oospore of the Phycophytes, but was rather homologous to the asexual spore-formation of the lower fungi. But the Laboulbeniaceae, which according to recent investigation exhibit asexual reproduction of the same type as the Coleochaeteae and Florideae, indicate that this view is erroneous and that the origin of the higher fungi is to be sought in about the same place as that of the last named groups. There is but one order and family...|$|E
