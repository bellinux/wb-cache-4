5|$|In {{order for}} the flow to be well defined, the given curve must be {{sufficiently}} smooth {{that it has a}} continuous curvature. However, once the flow starts, the curve becomes analytic, and remains so until reaching a <b>singularity</b> at which the curvature blows up.

5|$|Second, all {{solutions}} {{suggest that}} there was a gravitational <b>singularity</b> in the past, when R went to zero and matter and energy were infinitely dense.

However, the Penrose–Hawking <b>singularity</b> theorems show that a <b>singularity</b> should exist for very general conditions. Hence, according to Einstein's field equations, R grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot, dense state that existed immediately following this <b>singularity</b> (when R had a small, finite value); this is the essence of the Big Bang model of the Universe.

5|$|The Big Bang {{theory is}} the {{prevailing}} cosmological {{model for the}} universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded from a very high density and high temperature state, and offers a comprehensive explanation for {{a broad range of}} phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), large scale structure and Hubble's law. If the known laws of physics are extrapolated to the highest density regime, the result is a <b>singularity</b> which is typically associated with the Big Bang. Physicists are undecided whether this means the universe began from a <b>singularity,</b> or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe. After the initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity in halos of dark matter, eventually forming the stars and galaxies visible today.|$|E
