5|$|In Gannon's first match {{back at the}} club, {{the team}} lost a match 2–1 to joint-leaders Fleetwood Town, who {{achieved}} a record attendance in the fixture at Highbury. Gannon managed Stockport to their first back-to-back wins in over three years, since his last stint as manager, with successive 1–0 victories over Wrexham and Darlington. Gannon steered Stockport away from the drop zone, winning eight of the last 15 league games – when the side had only managed to win nine games throughout {{the whole of the}} 2010–11 campaign – to finish 16th in the final table. Gannon again focused on youth development, inducing young players such as Danny Whitehead, Cameron Darkwah, Danny Hattersley and Ian Ormson into the starting eleven. County regained <b>sole</b> <b>tenancy</b> of their Edgeley Park stadium {{for the first time in}} nine years from the beginning of the 2012–13 season, after Sale Sharks relocated for a second time, this time sharing with Salford City Reds at Barton.|$|E
