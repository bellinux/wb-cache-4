Another man stands, echoing and opposing the form of the artist, outside rather than inside, made clearly defined and yet barely identifiable by the light and shade. The positioning of such an area of strong tonal contrast right {{at the rear of the}} pictorial space is a daring compositional tactic. The shapes of bright light are similar to the irregular light <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foreground Maid of Honour, but the sharply defined door-frame repeats the border of the mirror.|$|E

The spots vary over individual coats and between individual jaguars: rosettes may include one or several dots, and the <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dots vary.

5|$|The use of polyhedra {{to model}} heavenly bodies {{can be traced}} back to Plato, who in the Timaeus {{identified}} the regular dodecahedron with the shape of the heavens and its twelve faces with the constellations of the zodiac.

5|$|In 1910, Eaton {{became the}} first {{scientist}} to publish a more {{detailed description of the}} entire Pteranodon skeleton, as it was known at the time. He used his findings to revise the classification of the genus once again based on {{a better understanding of the}} differences in pteranodont anatomy. Eaton conducted experiments using clay models of bones to help determine the effects of crushing and flattening on the <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arm bones Williston had used in his own classification. Eaton found that most of the differences in bone shapes could be easily explained by the pressures of fossilization, and concluded that no Pteranodon skeletons had any significant differences from each other besides their size. Therefore, Eaton was left to decide his classification scheme based on differences in the skulls alone, which he assigned to species just as Marsh did, by their size. In the end, Eaton recognized only three valid species: P. occidentalis, P. ingens, and P. longiceps.|$|E
5|$|The strong {{rotating}} {{winds of}} a tropical cyclone {{are a result}} of the conservation of angular momentum imparted by the Earth's rotation as air flows inwards toward the axis of rotation. As a result, they rarely form within 5° of the equator. Tropical cyclones are also almost completely absent from Earth’s southwestern quartersphere, mainly because the <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> African and South American continents permit the Benguela and Humboldt Currents to cover ocean basins as far north as 5˚N with excessively cool water. These powerful cold currents also produce much stronger vertical wind shear in the South Atlantic and Southeast Pacific, which typically prevent tropical depressions and minor storms there from developing into cyclones and prevent even the waters of the Brazil Current from being so hot as analogous western boundary currents or ocean gyres. Also, the African easterly jet and areas of atmospheric instability which gives rise to cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, along with the Asian monsoon and Western Pacific Warm Pool, are feature of the Northern Hemisphere and Australia.|$|E
5|$|The tooth resembles multituberculates—a {{large group}} of extinct mammals with many-cusped teeth—in the <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valleys and crests, but multituberculates lack fossae and usually have quadrangular teeth with two {{longitudinal}} rows of cusps separated by a central valley. In the same features, LACM 149371 resembles gondwanatheres, a small and enigmatic group of mammals from the Cretaceous through Eocene of the southern (Gondwanan) continents that {{may be related to}} multituberculates. In particular, Ferugliotherium from the late Cretaceous of Argentina has similarly formed cusps and also has crests that connect the cusps {{to the center of the}} tooth. However, the upper molars are unknown, and the low-crowned teeth of Ferugliotherium lack deep fossae. Members of the higher-crowned gondwanathere family Sudamericidae do have fossae. Goin and colleagues conclude that LACM 149371 most likely represents a member of the gondwanathere family Ferugliotheriidae; if so, it would be among the youngest known gondwanatheres.|$|E

5|$|Many nocturnal {{species have}} large, {{independently}} movable ears, {{although there are}} significant differences in sizes and <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ear between species. The structure of the middle and inner ear of strepsirrhines differs between the lemurs and lorisoids. In lemurs, the tympanic cavity, which surrounds the middle ear, is expanded. This leaves the ectotympanic ring, which supports the eardrum, free within the auditory bulla. This trait is also seen in adapiforms. In lorisoids, however, the tympanic cavity is smaller and the ectotympanic ring becomes attached {{to the edge of}} the auditory bulla. The tympanic cavity in lorisoids also has two accessory air spaces, which are not present in lemurs. Both lorisoids and cheirogaleid lemurs have replaced the internal carotid artery with an enlarged ascending pharyngeal artery. Strepsirrhines also possess distinctive features in their tarsus (ankle bones) that differentiate them from haplorhines, such as a sloping talo-fibular facet (the face where the talus bone and fibula meet) and a difference in the location of the position of the flexor fibularis tendon on the talus. These differences give strepsirrhines the ability to make more complex rotations of the ankle and indicate that their feet are habitually inverted, or turned inward, an adaptation for grasping vertical supports.|$|E
5|$|The astronomical {{phenomena}} {{of the solar}} eclipse and lunar eclipse had been observed in the 4th century BC by astronomers Gan De and Shi Shen; the latter gave instructions on predicting the eclipses based on the relative position of the Moon to the Sun. The philosopher Wang Chong argued against the 'radiating influence' theory of Jing Fang's writing in the 1st century BC and that of Zhang Heng (78–139); the latter two correctly hypothesized that {{the brightness of the}} Moon was merely light reflected from the Sun. Jing Fang had written in the 1st century BC of how it was long accepted in China that the Sun and Moon were spherical in shape ('like a crossbow bullet'), not flat. Shen Kuo also wrote of solar and lunar eclipses in this manner, yet expanded upon this to explain why the celestial bodies were spherical, going against the 'flat earth' theory for celestial bodies. However, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that Shen Kuo supported a round earth theory, which was introduced into Chinese science by Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi in the 17th century. When the Director of the Astronomical Observatory asked Shen Kuo if the <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun and Moon were round like balls or flat like fans, Shen Kuo explained that celestial bodies were spherical because of knowledge of waxing and waning of the Moon. Much like what Zhang Heng had said, Shen Kuo likened the Moon to a ball of silver, which does not produce light, but simply reflects light if provided from another source (the Sun). He explained that when the Sun's light is slanting, the Moon appears full. He then explained if one were to cover any sort of sphere with white powder, and then viewed from the side it would appear to be a crescent, hence he reasoned that celestial bodies were spherical. He also wrote that, although the Sun and Moon were in conjunction and opposition with each other once a month, this did not mean the Sun would be eclipsed every time their paths met, because of the small obliquity of their orbital paths.|$|E
