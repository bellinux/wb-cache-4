5|$|Experimental mercury vapor {{turbines}} {{were installed}} {{to increase the}} efficiency of fossil-fuel electrical power plants. The South Meadow power plant in Hartford, CT employed mercury as its working fluid, in a binary configuration with a secondary water circuit, {{for a number of years}} starting in the late 1920s in a drive to improve plant efficiency. Several other plants were built, including the Schiller Station in Portsmouth, NH, which went online in 1950. The idea did not catch on industry-wide due to the weight and toxicity of mercury, as well as the advent of supercritical <b>steam</b> <b>plants</b> in later years.|$|E
5|$|Work {{on the new}} Beta process {{building}} commenced on 20 October 1943. Equipment installation {{began on}} 1 April 1944, and it was ready for use on 10 September 1944. A third Beta process building, 9204-3, was authorized in May 1944 to process {{the output of the}} K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. It was completed on 15 May 1945. A fourth Beta process building, 9204-4, was authorized on 2 April 1945 and was completed by 1 December 1945. A new group of Alpha chemistry buildings known as the 9207 group was commenced in June 1944, but work was halted in June 1945 before they were completed. Along with these main buildings, there were offices, workshops, warehouses and other structures. There were two <b>steam</b> <b>plants</b> for heating, and a power plant for electricity.|$|E

25|$|Inexpensive and {{abundant}} electrical power {{was the main}} benefit the TVA brought to Tennessee, particularly to rural areas that previously did not have electrical service. TVA brought electricity to about 60,000 farm households across the state. By 1945, TVA was the largest electrical utility in the nation, a supplier of vast amounts of power whose presence in Tennessee attracted large industries to relocate near one of its dams or <b>steam</b> <b>plants.</b> This incentive contributed to important economic development in the state.|$|E
25|$|For the Carnot cycle, or its equivalent, {{the average}} value TH will equal the highest {{temperature}} available, namely TH, and TC the lowest, namely TC. For other less efficient cycles, TH will {{be lower than}} TH, and TC will be higher than TC. This can help illustrate, for example, why a reheater or a regenerator can improve the thermal efficiency of steam power plants—and why the thermal efficiency of combined-cycle power plants (which incorporate gas turbines operating at even higher temperatures) exceeds that of conventional <b>steam</b> <b>plants.</b> The first prototype of the diesel engine {{was based on the}} Carnot cycle.|$|E

50|$|The Fitchburg Central <b>Steam</b> <b>Plant</b> (locally {{known by}} its nickname: the PLT) was built in 1928 to provide steam and {{electricity}} to the many local paper mills. As the paper mills were abandoned or improved the Central <b>Steam</b> <b>Plant</b> fell into disuse and was abandoned. In 2008, the EPA designated the Central <b>Steam</b> <b>Plant</b> a brownfield site due to contamination of the site soil and groundwater with metals and inorganic contaminants. The EPA provided the City of Fitchburg $50,500 in grant money to help clean up hazardous substances on the site.|$|R

25|$|Hydropower is a {{flexible}} source of electricity since stations can be ramped {{up and down}} very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. Hydro turbines have a start-up time {{of the order of}} a few minutes. It takes around 60 to 90 seconds to bring a unit from cold start-up to full load; this is much shorter than for gas turbines or <b>steam</b> <b>plants.</b> Power generation can also be decreased quickly when there is a surplus power generation. Hence the limited capacity of hydropower units is not generally used to produce base power except for vacating the flood pool or meeting downstream needs. Instead, it serves as backup for non-hydro generators.|$|E
500|$|For the 1877 maneuvers, the new turret ironclad [...] {{replaced}} Kronprinz. The squadron {{was again}} {{sent to the}} Mediterranean, in response to unrest in the Ottoman Empire related to the Russo-Turkish War; the violence threatened German citizens living there. The squadron, again {{under the command of}} Batsch, steamed to the ports of Haifa and Jaffa in July 1877, but found no significant tensions ashore. Batsch then departed and cruised the Mediterranean {{for the remainder of the}} summer, returning to Germany in October. The newly commissioned [...] and , sister ships of Preussen, replaced Deutschland and Kaiser in the 1878 maneuvers, during which Grosser Kurfürst was accidentally rammed and sank with great loss of life. Deutschland and her sister Kaiser remained in reserve for the next six years. They were reactivated in the spring of 1883 for the summer maneuvers under the command of Wilhelm von Wickede. Due to their long period out of service, their engines proved troublesome during the training cruise. Indeed, the maneuvers were temporarily put on hold when the <b>steam</b> <b>plants</b> in Deutschland, Kaiser, and Kronprinz broke down. Regardless, the 1883 cruise was the first year the German navy completely abandoned the use of sails on its large ironclads. Deutschland went into reserve during the 1884 maneuvers, which were conducted by a homogenous squadron composed of the four s.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{historically}} successful combined cycles {{have used}} hot cycles with mercury vapour turbines, magnetohydrodynamic generators or molten carbonate fuel cells, with <b>steam</b> <b>plants</b> {{for the low}} temperature [...] "bottoming" [...] cycle. Bottoming cycles operating from a steam condenser's heat exhaust are theoretically possible, but uneconomical because of the very large, expensive equipment needed to extract energy from the small temperature differences between condensing steam and outside air or water. However, it is common in cold climates (such as Finland) to drive community heating systems from a power plant's condenser heat. Such cogeneration systems can yield theoretical efficiencies above 95%.|$|E
2500|$|The turbine {{efficiency}} of the gas Tesla turbine {{is estimated to be}} above 60, reaching a maximum of 95 percent [...] Keep in mind that {{turbine efficiency}} is different from the cycle {{efficiency of the}} engine using the turbine. Axial turbines which operate today in <b>steam</b> <b>plants</b> or jet engines have efficiencies of about 60–70% (Siemens Turbines Data). This is different from the cycle efficiencies of the plant or engine which are between approximately 25% and 42%, and are limited by any irreversibilities to be below the Carnot cycle efficiency. Tesla claimed that a steam version of his device would achieve around 95 percent efficiency. Actual tests of a Tesla steam turbine at the Westinghouse works showed a steam rate of 38 pounds per horsepower-hour, corresponding to a turbine efficiency in the range of 20%, while contemporary steam turbines could often achieve turbine efficiencies of well over 50%. The thermodynamic efficiency is a measure of how well it performs compared to an isentropic case. It is the ratio of the ideal to the actual work input/output. Turbine efficiency is defined as the ratio of the ideal change in enthalpy to the real enthalpy for the same change in pressure.|$|E
