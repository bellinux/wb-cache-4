30|$|FD is a {{developmental}} disorder {{of the bone}} in which normal bone marrow is replaced by fibro-osseous tissue with expansion of the medullary cavity. Cranio-facial fibrous dysplasia is commonly involves the frontal, ethmoid or <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bones.</b> It is typically seen {{in children and adolescents}} with slight female predilection. FD is monoostotic in 70 - 80  % cases and polyostotic in the rest. Orbital bony involvement leads to hypertelorism, exophthalmos, visual impairment and blindness. Surgery is needed to correct facial deformity or severe optic nerve compression [1, 26, 51].|$|R

5|$|The {{decision}} on whether to surgically decompress the pituitary gland is complex and mainly dependent on the severity of visual loss and visual field defects. If visual acuity is severely reduced, there are large or worsening visual field defects, or the level of consciousness falls consistently, professional guidelines recommend that surgery is performed. Most commonly, operations on the pituitary gland are performed through transsphenoidal surgery. In this procedure, surgical instruments are passed through the nose towards the <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bone,</b> which is opened to give access to the cavity that contains the pituitary gland. Surgery is most likely to improve vision if there was some remaining vision before surgery, and if surgery is undertaken within a week of the onset of symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} carotid arteries are {{branches of}} the common carotid arteries. They enter the cranium through the carotid canal, travel through the cavernous sinus and enter the subarachnoid space. They then enter the circle of Willis, with two branches, the anterior cerebral arteries emerging. These branches travel forward and then upward along the longitudinal fissure, and supply the front and midline parts of the brain. One or more small anterior communicating arteries join the two anterior cerebral arteries shortly after they emerge as branches. The internal carotid arteries continue forward as the middle cerebral arteries. They travel sideways along the <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bone</b> of the eye socket, then upwards through the insula cortex, where final branches arise. The middle cerebral arteries send branches along their length.|$|E

25|$|In {{this part}} of its course, the artery is {{situated}} between the layers of the dura mater forming the cavernous sinus, but covered by the lining membrane of the sinus. It at first ascends toward the posterior clinoid process, then passes forward {{by the side of}} the body of the <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bone,</b> and again curves upward on the medial side of the anterior clinoid process, and perforates the dura mater forming the roof of the sinus. The curve in the cavernous segment is called the carotid siphon.

25|$|Ommaya’s cetripedal theory {{identified}} {{that the effects}} always begin at {{the surface of the}} brain in mild injury and extend inward to affect the diencephalic- mesencephalic core in more severe injury. His work showed that both translational and rotational acceleration produce focal lesions but that only rotational acceleration produced diffuse axonal injury. When damage is found in the rostral brainstem it is also associated with diffuse hemispheric damage. Prior to his work it was believed that the mechanism of concussion was linked to primary brainstem injury. However, the brainstem and mesencephalon are the last structure to be affected in severe injury, and rotational rather than translational forces produce concussion. Contact phenomenon {{contribute to the development of}} focal lesions, e.g. frontal and temporal lesions due to contact with the <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bone.</b> Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have supported these theories. They have confirmed that the distribution of lesions follows a centripetal pattern that follows injury severity identified by the Glascow Coma Score.|$|E

Other clinical signs included doming of the forehead, thickening of the carpal joints, incoordination and weakness. Gross lesions in 8 of the calves examined consisted in hydrocephalus and thickened occipital and <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bones.</b> In 4 of these calves the optic nerves were constricted {{as a result}} of a reduction in size and dorsoventral narrowing of the optic canals. Microscopical changes in the optic nerves were characterized by necrosis, demyelination and fibrosis. Oedema or gliosis of the optic disc occurred in some of the calves. Retinal lesions included atrophy and gliosis of the ganglion cell layer and the nerve fibre layer. Three of the calves showed focal retinal dysplasia with occasional rosette formation.

Every specimen had the venous structure arranged as a plexus, however, although the channels were variable in number, form, and diameter, the two sides were quite symmetrical. Channels of smaller diameter predominated anteriorly. There was no demonstrable muscular layer in these vessels; the endothelial lining was easily visualized. Fatty tissue separated the venous channels {{from each other and}} from arteries and nerves. The distance from the carotid artery and the lateral wall increased anteriorly, but there were significant veins between these two structures in only 35 % of the cases.

30|$|Rapid maxillary {{expansion}} (RME) {{is routinely}} used in orthodontic treatment to correct transverse maxillary constriction by {{opening of the}} midpalatal suture [11]. It works by separation of {{the two halves of}} the palatal bones across the median palatal suture due to a lateral force from the appliance [12]. Both the zygomatic and <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bones</b> of the cranial base are met with resistance during expansion. Therefore, the separation of maxillary bones occurs in a triangular manner, with the apex toward the nasal cavity and the base at the same level as the palatine process [13] resulting in more opening anteriorly than posteriorly [14]. Thus, one can extrapolate that there will be greatest improvement in the caliber of the anterior rate limiting nasal valve area from RME compared to other regions of the nasal cavity. Some studies have reported correction of septal deviation as an incidental finding from RME [15, 16]. To our knowledge, no review of the literature has been conducted to investigate this finding. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review is to methodically analyze the available literature concerning the effects of RME on nasal septal deviation.|$|R

It is erroneously stated in several anatomy text books that the internal carotid artery passes through the foramen lacerum. This at best has only ever been a partial truth in that it passes through the superior part of the foramen {{on its way to the}} cavernous sinus. As such it does not traverse the skull through it. The inferior part of the foramen is actually filled with fibrocartilage. The broad consensus is that the internal carotid artery should not be described as travelling through the foramen lacerum.|$|E

Cells from the pi osencephalic neural crest migrate into the frontal nasal process and mix with the mesencephalic neural crest cells in the lateral nasal processes, around the optic cupule and beneath the diencephalon. In addition, the mesencephalic neural crest cells form the bulk of the mesenchyme of the maxillary processes and mandibular arch, whereas the rhombencephalic neural crest cells become located in the branchial arches.
