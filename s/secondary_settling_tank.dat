40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{contribution}} is partly to build consensus on a consistent modelling methodology (CMM) of complex real processes in wastewater treatment by combining classical concepts with results from applied mathematics, and partly to apply it to the clarification-thickening process in the <b>secondary</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tank.</b> In the CMM, the real process should be approximated by a mathematical model (process model; ordinary or partial differential equation (ODE or PDE)), {{which in turn is}} approximated by a simulation model (numerical method) implemented on a computer. These steps have often not been carried out in a correct way. The <b>secondary</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> was chosen as a case since {{this is one of the}} most complex processes in a wastewater treatment plant and simulation models developed decades ago have no guarantee of satisfying fundamental mathematical and physical properties. Nevertheless, such methods are still used in commercial tools to date. This particularly becomes of interest as the state-of-the-art practice is moving towards plant-wide modelling. Then all submodels interact and errors propagate through the model and severely hamper any calibration effort and, hence, the predictive purpose of the model. The CMM is described by applying it first to a simple conversion process in the biological reactor yielding an ODE solver, and then to the solideliquid separation in the <b>secondary</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tank,</b> yielding a PDE solver. Time has come to incorporate established mathematical techniques into environmental engineering, and wastewater treatment modelling in particular, and to use proven reliable and consistent simulation models...|$|E

The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to bring the theoretical and practical aspects of <b>secondary</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> developments closer together. This was achieved firstly, by evaluating and developing empirical relationships from which the flux theory constants may be derived from simpler sludge settleability measures; and secondly, by developing a computer model for the simulation of dynamic behaviour of full scale secondary settling tanks.

It was then calibrated with full scale data and used to verify the flux theory by comparing the simulated predictions and the measured results. The simulations demonstrated that a calibrated and verified dynamic settling tank model based on the flux theory and incorporating various refinements such as turbulent diffusivity implicitly encompasses such features of <b>secondary</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> behaviour such as maximum underflow concentration and sludge storage concentration and capacity.

The purpose of this work was to perform a mass balance of emerging organic micropollutants on activated sludge tank and on <b>secondary</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> in a small wastewater treatment plant in the Municipality of Rome. The analytes monitored in this work were: Estrone (E 1), 17 β-Estradiol (E 2) and 17 α- Ethinylestradiol (EE 2) for steroid hormones, 4 -Nonylphenol (4 -NP) and Bisphenol A (BPA) for substituted Phenols and Alkylphenols, Amphetamine (AM), Methamphetamine (MET), Benzoylecgonine (BEG) and 11 -nor-Δ 9 -THC- 9 carboxy (THC-COOH) for drugs of abuse. Mass balance on activated sludge tank showed that the emerging organic micropollutants removed were BPA (59 %), EE 2 (34 %), AM (56 %) and THCCOOH (35 %). The processes occurring in the <b>secondary</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> were able to reduce 4 -NP (26 %), BPA (74 %), E 1 (82 %), EE 2 (93 %), AM (44 %), MET (80 %), BEG (72 %) and THC-COOH (39 %).

40|$|Biological {{nitrogen}} (N) {{and phosphorus}} (P) removal from municipal wastewater with the activated sludge (AS) {{system has been}} the preferred technology for the last 40 years. While several questions remain to be answered for more consistent, reliable and stable performance for enhanced biological P removal (EBPR), recent developments in this technology have focused on (i) increasing capacity and reducing the plant space footprint and (ii) improving N removal. To increase capacity and reduce AS system space, (a) integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS), (b) external nitrification, (c) membrane, (d) aerobic granulation BNR systems and (e) more efficient N removal bioprocesses (anammox and nitrite shunt) have been developed. With IFAS, fixed media {{are added to the}} aerobic activated sludge reactor to make nitrification independent of the suspended AS sludge age. With external nitrification, nitrification is achieved in a side-stream fixed media reactor, which removes the size-defining nitrification process from the suspended AS system and halves its sludge age, improves sludge settleability and increases capacity.

Subsequently, a unified model framework that considers several particle classes is proposed in order to describe distributions in settling behaviour as well as the effect of variations in particle properties on the settling process. The result is a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) that are valid from dilute concentrations, where they correspond to discrete settling, to concentrated suspensions, where they correspond to compression settling.

In this system, there is a steady input flow (flow from the primary clarifier or settling tank with some part from the secondary clarifier or <b>secondary</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tank)</b> and output flow connection to the secondary clarifier or settling tank. The experimental and numerical results obtained through batch systems can not be relied on and applied for the designing of a continuous aeration tank.

Geometric parameters have a greater influence on the mass transfer process of surface aeration systems. The present work establishes the optimal geometric configuration of a continuous-flow surface aeration system. It is found that the maintenance of these optimal geometric parameters systems result in maximum aeration efficiency. By maintaining the obtained optimal geometric parameters, further experiments are conducted in continuous-flow surface aerators with three different sizes in order to develop design curves correlating the oxygen transfer coefficient and power number with the rotor speed.

Concentration profiles measured in a flat-bottom circular (fbSST) that is equipped with suction-lift sludge removal, served for CFD model validation. We investigate the factors that may deteriorate the 1 -D simulation performance of clarifier models, which incorporate dispersion {{both in terms of}} the effluent sludge concentration {{and in terms of the}} sludge blanket height. Furthermore, dispersion-models can account for the effect of clarifier flow conditions on thickening performance. However, correlations, found in the literature, are shown to have limited efficiency under the wide flow boundary conditions examined in this study. Optimisation of the 1 -D clarifier model structure is proposed by using an overflow dependent dispersion coefficient and including a feed flow dependent reduction factor in the downward convective velocity term. Results obtained show improved simulation performance in the clarification zone and allow for an efficient flow-dependency formulation of the thickening performance. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Many constitutive relations for hindered settling, compression and dispersion can be used within the model, allowing the user to switch on and off effects of interest depending on the modelling goal as well as investigate the suitability of certain constitutive expressions.

Sludge may also be defined as any solid, semisolid or liquid material generated from a wastewater treatment process. This sludge is also commonly known as biosolids. Wastewater treatment operations require careful management of sludge, not only after removal from the treatment process, but also during the treatment process: sludge is a critical biologically active mix of water, organic matter (derived from human wastes, food wastes, etc.), inorganic solids (including trace elements), dead and alive micro-organisms (including pathogens), and trace contaminants (e. g., chemicals).

The velocity of wastewater is in the most cases very low, and even insignificant. However, finding that the sludge cloud has a non-standard form of a double wave gives the opportunity to optimize the operation of facilities sedimentation tank. The measured parameters are used as calibration parameters to input to the mathematical simulations, which are created by software ANSYS fluent...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{membranes}} for solid-liquid separation in BNRAS {{systems is}} investigated on a lab scale. The initial phase of investigation {{suggested that they}} are i) entirely feasible technically, ii) influence {{the design of the}} BNR system and WWTP design greatly, and iii) offer several advantages over BNR systems using <b>secondary</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tanks</b> such as improved effluent quality, which is independent of sludge flocculation or settling characteristics, reduced WWTP footprint and adjustable sludge mass fractions with recycle flows. However, years of application on full scale internationally have been limited to aerobic systems and little is known of the influence of membranes on BNR systems. This research project has been divided into two components, Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 1 focused on establishing initial design procedures for MBR BNR systems and a steady state analysis of MBR systems. Phase two continued the steady state analysis and provided parent systems for kinetic studies into the impact of membranes on BNR. This paper briefly outlines the work done to date and compares the results from both phases and the conclusions we can draw from them...|$|R
40|$|Advanced 1 -D {{models for}} <b>Secondary</b> <b>Settling</b> <b>Tanks</b> (SSTs) {{explicitly}} account for several phenomena {{that influence the}} settling process (such as hindered settling and compression settling). For each of these phenomena a valid mathematical expression needs to be selected and its parameters calibrated to obtain a model {{that can be used}} for operation and control. This is, however, a challenging task as these phenomena may occur simultaneously. Therefore, the presented work evaluates several available expressions for hindered settling based on long-term batch settling data. Specific attention is paid to the behaviour of these hindered settling functions in the compression region in order to evaluate how the modelling of sludge compression is influenced by the choice of a certain hindered settling function. The analysis shows that the exponential hindered settling forms, which are most commonly used in traditional SST models, not only account for hindered settling but partly lump other phenomena (compression) as well. This makes them unsuitable for advanced 1 -D models that explicitly include each phenomenon in a modular way. A power-law function is shown to be more appropriate to describe the hindered settling velocity in advanced 1 -D SST models...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} comply with {{effluent}} standards, wastewater operators need to avoid hydraulic overloading of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), as this can result in the washout of activated sludge from <b>secondary</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tanks.</b> Hydraulic overloading can occur in a systematic way, for instance when sewer network connections are extended without increasing the WWTP’s capacity accordingly. This study demonstrates the use of rule-based real-time control (RTC) to reduce the load to the WWTP while restricting the overall overflow volume of the sewer system to a minimum. Further, it shows the added value of RTC despite the limited availability of monitoring data and information on the catchment through a parsimonious simulation approach, using relocation of spatial system boundaries and creating required input data through reverse modelling. Focus was hereby on the accurate modelling of pump hydraulics and control. Finally, two different methods of global sensitivity analysis were employed to verify the influence of parameters of both the model and the implemented control algorithm. Both methods show the importance of good knowledge of the system properties, but that monitoring errors play a minor role. status: publishe...|$|R
