25|$|The chant (mele) is {{typically}} {{accompanied by an}} ipu heke (a double gourd) and/or pahu (<b>sharkskin</b> covered drum). Some dances require dancers to utilize hula implements such as an ipu (single gourd), iliili (waterworn lava stone castanets),uliuli (feathered gourd rattles), pu`li (split bamboo sticks) or kalaau (rhythm sticks). The older, formal kind of hula is called kahiko, while the modern version is auana. There are also religious chants called oli; when accompanied by dancing and drums, it is called mele hula pahu.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The New York Times, Mickey Rapkin {{considered}} Roma to be {{the central}} character of the play, describing him as [...] "the salesman’s salesman, a shark in a <b>sharkskin</b> suit". Mantegna has stated that he feels Roma is not a [...] "sleazy" [...] character, but simply {{a man who can}} convince customers to follow through on their dreams. Reviewing a 2012 revival at the La Jolla Playhouse, Charles McNulty of the Los Angeles Times compared Roma to a Giacomo Casanova-type figure, adding that [...] "when Roma puts the moves on a prospective buyer, it's as though he's making love to them". While interviewing actor Aidan Gillen, The Guardian Mark Lawson felt that Roma was an amoral character, considering him a [...] "super-schmoozer". Gillen, then portraying the character in the Apollo Theatre in London, described him as a [...] "cunt with a romantic, poetic streak".|$|E

50|$|Typically, <b>sharkskin</b> {{fabric is}} made {{with the use of}} acetate or as a blend of the two, and its two-toned woven {{appearance}} is achieved by basketweaving, thereby creating a pattern in which the colored threads run diagonal to the white fibers. Because both fabric options already have a relatively smooth texture, the combination results in the finish for which <b>sharkskin</b> fabric is known.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{attribute}} the [...] "fading {{in and out}} of fashion" [...] of <b>sharkskin</b> of any sort to {{the fact that many of}} the ubiquitous [...] "artificial sharkskin" [...] variants had [...] "created an indelible public impression that all <b>sharkskin</b> ought to be deemed [...] "tacky", to be eschewed, as it is in Lisa Birnbach's Official Preppy Handbook, 1980, which reflected, and in itself, in-turn, influenced, many consumers' misgivings regarding its social status. From the late 2000s until the mid 2010s, three piece <b>sharkskin</b> [...] "shiny suits", sometimes incorporating a contrasting shawl collar, briefly became fashionable in America and Australia due to a resurgence of interest in the early 1960s fashions depicted in Mad Men.|$|E
5000|$|Artificial <b>sharkskin</b> {{variants}} {{used for}} suiting {{first appeared in}} the 1950s and rapidly garnered world-wide appeal in artificial <b>sharkskin</b> (costing much less than its [...] "natural" [...] counterpart: which most consumers were not aware existed, so far out of their price range it remained), attaining broad popularity in the early 1960s and the disco era of the late 70s, followed by brief fashion resurgences in the mid-1980s, mid-1990s and late 2000s: its variations often contain some wool percentage blend. More recently, such artificial <b>sharkskin</b> fabrics have undergone technological improvements and have attained new desirability, even among [...] "fabric purists" [...] who would have conventionally rejected out-of-hand any [...] "artificial sharkskin" [...] substitutes for the real item containing a majority percentage of mohair.|$|E
50|$|Twills can {{be divided}} into even-sided and warp-faced. Even-sided twills include foulard or surah, herringbone, houndstooth, serge, <b>sharkskin,</b> and twill flannel. Warp-faced twills include cavalry twill, chino, covert, denim, drill, fancy twill, gabardine, and lining twill.|$|E

50|$|The Pahu drum is {{a staple}} in {{traditional}} Hawaiian dance, providing a basic rhythmic accompaniment. The drums' tall, narrow body is carved from wood, usually from a segment of a coconut tree trunk, and the head is made from dried <b>sharkskin.</b> The traditional Hawaiian Pahu was made from a sectioned and seasoned wooden tree trunk, preferably of coconut wood, although possibly other types of native wood may have been used. The original material used for the Pahu’s waha (head) was either shark or ray skin. Heiau Pahu tended to be originally made with a waha of ray skin, while non-religious Pahu often used <b>sharkskin.</b> The Pahu is played with the bare hands and fingers.|$|E

50|$|Wasabi {{is often}} grated {{with a metal}} oroshigane, but some prefer to use a more {{traditional}} tool made of dried <b>sharkskin</b> with fine skin {{on one side and}} coarse skin on the other. A hand-made grater with irregular teeth can also be used. If a shark-skin grater is unavailable, ceramic is usually preferred.|$|E
50|$|Inspired by {{exposure}} to the West Coast lounge scene, in the early 1990s Johnson produced clothing for the British easy-listening crowd, including three-button Italian suits in <b>sharkskin</b> and Regency-collared outfits in crushed velvet, matched with giant 'Teddy bear' fake fur coats (as worn by Robbie Williams in the promo for Take That's 1995 single Back For Good).|$|E

50|$|The drums musicians play have a {{hierarchy}} system. Drummers start {{on a large}} bass drum called tariparau (sometimes called pahu). This is the only drum that the very few female drummers in Tahiti play. It has two membranes traditionally made out of <b>sharkskin</b> and is struck with a single mallet making the timbre low but only slightly resonate. It provides the basic pulse for the rhythm.|$|E
5000|$|Under {{the name}} Gladys Parker Designs, her {{clothing}} line {{was sold in}} stores as early as 1934, capitalizing on her fame as the artist of Flapper Fanny Says.

50|$|Molded and laser-ablated {{shark skin}} replicas have been fabricated, and {{shown to be}} {{oleophobic}} in water. The molded replicas use a negative made of polyvinylsiloxane dental wax and the positive replica was made of epoxy. These replicas have also shown that the structure of shark skin reduces the fluid drag caused by turbulent flow. The fluid dynamic properties of <b>sharkskin</b> have been mimicked in swimsuit, nautical, and aerospace applications.|$|E
50|$|The second drum in {{the rank}} is the fa’atete drum. It {{is a single}} {{membrane}} which can be struck with hands or drum sticks. It is usually made out of coconut tree wood with <b>sharkskin</b> stretched across with intricate carving of flowers, sea turtles, leaves and designs on the bottom. It plays a slightly more complex texture than the tariparau. It has a high tom sound with less resonation.|$|E
5000|$|True wasabi has {{anti-microbial}} {{properties and}} {{may reduce the}} risk of food poisoning. The traditional grating tool for wasabi is a <b>sharkskin</b> grater or samegawa oroshi. An imitation wasabi (seiyo-wasabi), made from horseradish, mustard powder and green dye is common. It is found at lower-end kaiten-zushi restaurants, in bento box sushi and at most restaurants outside Japan. If manufactured in Japan, it may be labelled [...] "Japanese Horseradish".|$|E
5000|$|In the 17th {{and early}} 18th centuries, the term [...] "shagreen" [...] {{began to be}} applied to leather made from <b>sharkskin</b> or the skin of a rayfish (probably the pearled ray, Hypolophus sephen). This form is also termed <b>sharkskin</b> or galuchat. Such skins are {{naturally}} covered with round, closely set, calcified papillae called placoid scales, whose size is chiefly dependent on the age and size of the animal. These scales are ground down to give a roughened surface of rounded pale protrusions, between which the dye (again, typically green vegetable dye) shows when the material is coloured from the other side. This latter form of shagreen was first popularised in Europe by Jean-Claude Galluchat (d. 1774), a master leatherworker in the court of Louis XV of France. It quickly became a fashion amongst the French aristocracy, and migrated throughout Europe by the mid-18th century. [...] "The appeal of shagreen in Europe was closely bound up with the way the translucent skin absorbs colour, but in Japan, its whiteness was the measure of value".|$|E
50|$|The {{exterior}} of the desk is covered with shagreen (possibly <b>sharkskin)</b> and fitted with metal-gilt angle-mounts, loop handles and ball feet, all added during the 18th century. The interior surfaces of the compartments are lined with red silk velvet, probably added during the 19th century. The writing surface and the large compartment have been relined very crudely with a crimson silk velvet, the appearance of which is considerably older {{than that of the}} red velvet.|$|E
5000|$|The pahu or pa'u is a {{traditional}} musical instrument found in Polynesia: Hawaii, Tahiti, Cook Islands, Samoa, and Tokelau. Carved from a single log and covered on the playing end with a stretched <b>sharkskin,</b> the pahu is played with the palms and fingers of the hand. It is considered a sacred instrument and was generally kept in a temple (heiau), and used to accompany a repertoire of [...] sacred songs called hula pahu/ura p'au.|$|E
5000|$|During the Warring States period, the {{southern}} State of Chu was {{renowned for its}} rhinoceros hide armour, and the philosopher Xun Zi from the northern State of Qi, who was an official in Chu for a short time, notes that [...] "the soldiers of Chu were equipped with armour made of <b>sharkskin</b> and rhinoceros hide as hard as metal or stone, and with pikes of Nanyang steel that could sting a man like a wasp or a scorpion".|$|E
50|$|Eventually, however, Fillmore {{found the}} lure of pimping too strong and {{effectively}} left music behind. He built up a stable of prostitutes and had anywhere from ten to fifteen women working Fillmore Street every day. His wardrobe consisted of <b>sharkskin</b> suits, alligator shoes and diamond watches, and he could often be seen cruising up and down Fillmore Street in a new Cadillac. In the documentary American Pimp, Fillmore estimates that, in his entire career as a pimp, he had over 9,000+ prostitutes.|$|E
