5|$|The {{following}} day, 19 October 2011, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs Teo Chee Hean {{explained the}} relevance of the ISA and its powers of preventive detention. He noted that in the 1960s preventive detention was primarily used to counter the subversive Communist threat posed by the Malayan Communist Party which was hiding within legal organizations. For the past two decades, though, preventive detention has helped safeguard Singapore's national security by countering threats posed by espionage and terrorism. Preventive detention allows for a comprehensive assessment of a threat, as opposed to a criminal case tried before a court which requires the court to consider only the specific acts that relate to the charge. Detaining those who have not yet committed overt deeds that warrant prosecution also allows pre-emptive action to be taken to neutralize threats before they materialize into actual harm. In addition, the Minister said that detention without trial is preferable in situations where open prosecutions in court are not practicable due to the confidentiality of certain intelligence. Such intelligence might have been obtained through foreign security agencies on the understanding that the source and details would not be disclosed to an open court. What is more, disclosure of confidential intelligence could compromise ongoing or future operations through the revelation of existing <b>sources</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b> of intelligence gathering. However, if confidential information were withheld from the court, a criminal case could be weakened due to evidential requirements, which may result in the acquittal of an otherwise guilty accused. Finally, court proceedings may stall investigations {{as part of a broader}} network, and could exacerbate situations where communal sensitivities are involved.|$|E

It is possible to generate blurred images with two different <b>methods</b> – <b>source</b> <b>and</b> observer <b>methods.</b> This study compared blur adaption with <b>source</b> <b>and</b> observer <b>methods</b> for combinations of defocus and higher-order aberrations. Participants adapted to a blurred natural scene for 1 minute and performed a visual acuity task with tumbling Es. Negligible blur adaption was noticed for both <b>source</b> <b>and</b> observer <b>methods.</b> A longer adapting period might be necessary to achieve significant improvement in visual acuity following blur adaptation...|$|R
