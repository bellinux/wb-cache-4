Additionally, as Marines, the squadron is required to maintain the tactical, technical, small-arms weapons proficiency, and physical fitness capability, along with the requisite discipline, morale, espirit de corps, and fighting spirit to enable the squadron to form into provisional rifle platoons, to either reinforce the attack or augument the defense, as the overall tactical situation necessitates.|$|E
25|$|The PLA Navy {{was ranked}} in 1987 {{as the third}} largest navy in the world, {{although}} naval personnel had comprised only 12 percent of PLA strength.

The 350,000-person Navy included Naval Air Force units of 34,000 men, the Coastal Defense Forces of 38,000, and the Marine Corps of 56,500. Navy Headquarters, which controlled the three fleet commands, was subordinate to the PLA General <b>Staff</b> <b>Department.</b> In 1987, China's 1,500km coastline was protected by more than 100 diesel-powered Romeo- and Whiskey-class submarines, which could remain at sea only a limited time. Inside this protective ring and within range of shore-based aircraft were destroyers and frigates mounting Styx anti-ship missiles, depth-charge projectors, and guns up to 130mm. Any invader penetrating the destroyer and frigate protection would have been swarmed by almost 900 fast-attack craft. Stormy weather limited the range of these small boats, however, and curtailed air support. Behind the inner ring were Coastal Defense Force personnel operating naval shore batteries of Styx missiles and guns, backed by ground force units deployed in depth.|$|E

2500|$|The PLAN traces its lineage to {{units of}} the Republic of China Navy who {{defected}} to the People's Liberation Army {{towards the end of}} the Chinese Civil War. [...] In 1949, Mao Zedong asserted that [...] "to oppose imperialist aggression, we must build a powerful navy". [...] During the Landing Operation on Hainan Island, the communists used wooden junks fitted with mountain guns as both transport and warships against the Republic of China Navy. The Naval Academy was set up at Dalian on 22 November 1949, mostly with Soviet instructors. [...] The navy was established in September 1950 by consolidating regional naval forces under Joint <b>Staff</b> <b>Department</b> command in Jiangyan, now in Taizhou, Jiangsu province. It then consisted of a motley collection of ships and boats acquired from the Kuomintang forces. The Naval Air Force was added two years later. By 1954 an estimated 2,500 Soviet naval advisers were in China—possibly one adviser to every thirty Chinese naval personnel—and the Soviet Union began providing modern ships. With Soviet assistance, the navy reorganized in 1954 and 1955 into the North Sea Fleet, East Sea Fleet, and South Sea Fleet, and a corps of admirals and other naval officers was established from the ranks of the ground forces. In shipbuilding the Soviets first assisted the Chinese, then the Chinese copied Soviet designs without assistance, and finally the Chinese produced vessels of their own design. Eventually Soviet assistance progressed to the point that a joint Sino-Soviet Pacific Ocean fleet was under discussion.|$|E
