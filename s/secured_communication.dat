40|$|<b>Secure</b> <b>communication</b> using {{synchronization}} between chaotic systems (chaotic <b>secure</b> <b>communication,</b> for short) is a {{new concept}} of <b>secure</b> <b>communication.</b> The great potentials {{of this kind of}} ``hardware key'' <b>secure</b> <b>communication</b> systems had driven the progress of this field rapidly. Since 1992, chaotic <b>secure</b> <b>communication</b> had evolved four generations. In this paper, a detailed history of chaotic <b>secure</b> <b>communication</b> systems is given. The disadvantage of the first three generations of chaotic <b>secure</b> <b>communication</b> schemes is low efficiency of channel usage. To overcome this disadvantage, a chaotic communication scheme, which belongs to the fourth generation, using impulsive synchronization of chaotic systems is presented. In this paper, impulsive synchronization of two chaotic systems is reformulated as impulsive stabilization of a synchronization error system to the origin. Based on the theory of impulsive differential equations, we present theoretical results on the asymptotic synchronization of two chaotic systems by using synchronization impulses. An estimate of the upper bound of impulse interval is given for the purpose of asymptotic synchronization. The robustness of impulsive synchronization to additive channel noise and parameter mismatch is also studied. We conclude that impulsive synchronization is more robust than continuous synchronization. Combining both conventional cryptographic method and impulsive synchronization of chaotic systems, we propose a new chaotic <b>secure</b> <b>communication</b> scheme. We use this new chaotic <b>secure</b> <b>communication</b> scheme to transmit a speech signal. Computer simulation results based on Chua's oscillators are given.

40|$|Semi-quantum {{protocols}} {{that allow}} {{some of the}} users to remain classical are proposed for a large class of problems associated with <b>secure</b> <b>communication</b> and <b>secure</b> multiparty computation. Specifically, first time semi-quantum protocols are proposed for key agreement, controlled deterministic <b>secure</b> <b>communication</b> and dialogue, and it is shown that the semi-quantum protocols for controlled deterministic <b>secure</b> <b>communication</b> and dialogue {{can be reduced to}} semi-quantum protocols for e-commerce and private comparison (socialist millionaire problem), respectively. Complementing with the earlier proposed semi-quantum schemes for key distribution, secret sharing and deterministic <b>secure</b> <b>communication,</b> set of schemes proposed here and subsequent discussions have established that almost every <b>secure</b> <b>communication</b> and computation tasks that can be performed using fully quantum protocols can also be performed in semi-quantum manner. Further, it addresses a fundamental question in context of a large number problems- how much quantumness is (how many quantum parties are) required to perform a specific <b>secure</b> <b>communication</b> task? Some of the proposed schemes are completely orthogonal-state-based, and thus, fundamentally different from the existing semi-quantum schemes that are conjugate-coding-based.

40|$|<b>Secure</b> <b>communication</b> guaranteeing reliability, authenticity, {{and privacy}} in sensor {{networks}} with active adversaries is a challenging research problem since asymmetric key cryptosystems are {{not suitable for}} sensor nodes with limited computation and communication capabilities.

50|$|Prior to any <b>secured</b> <b>communication,</b> users must set up {{the details}} of the cryptography. In some {{instances}} this may require exchanging identical keys (in the case of a symmetric key system). In others it may require possessing the other party's public key. While public keys can be openly exchanged (their corresponding private key is kept secret), symmetric keys must be exchanged over a secure communication channel. Formerly, exchange of such a key was extremely troublesome, and was greatly eased by access to secure channels such as a diplomatic bag. Clear text exchange of symmetric keys would enable any interceptor to immediately learn the key, and any encrypted data.|$|E

The capabilities of the aircraft are being enhanced by the incorporation of modern avionics systems consisting primarily of two Multi-Function Displays (MFDs) Mission and Display Processor (MDP), Sextant Ring Laser Gyros (RLG INSI), combined GPS/GLONASS navigation, HUD with UFCP, Digital Map Generator (DMG), jam-resistant <b>Secured</b> <b>Communication,</b> stand-by UHF communication, data link and a comprehensive Electronic Warfare (EW) Suite. A mission planning and retrieval facility, VTR and HUD Camera will also be fitted. The aircraft retains stand-by (conventional) instrumentation, including artificial horizon, altimeter and airspeed indicator, to cater for the failure of HUD and the MFDs. The MiG-27s are also being equipped with the French Agave or Russian Komar radar. The installation of the radar would give the MiG-27 anti-ship and some air-to-air capability. It is expected that at least 140 of the 180 aircraft will be converted from MiG-27MLs.|$|E

50|$|When, in {{the autumn}} of 1109, Urraca married Alfonso the Battler, the King of Aragon and Navarre, Pedro opposed the marriage, which might have {{interfered}} with the succession of Urraca's son by Raymond. Within months of the wedding Pedro had rebelled in Galicia against Urraca's authority. Early in May 1110 Alfonso the Battler entered Galicia with an army. At some point before early July he ravaged the lands of Pedro Fróilaz, but without much effect. Late that summer, a faction of Galicians, led by Pedro with the young Alfonso in tow, visited Urraca at Castrojeriz and there became convinced that she was making peace with her estranged husband. This prompted Pedro to seek the advice of Henry, Count of Portugal, a relative of Raymond of Galicia and {{the most powerful man in}} the west of the kingdom. On Henry's advice Pedro arrested the partisans of the queen who had journeyed with him and returned to Galicia, where he opened negotiations with the queen. In exchange for the freedom of her supporters she surrendered the castle of Santa María de Castrelo on the Galician border with Portugal. This acquisition <b>secured</b> <b>communication</b> with Henry for the future.|$|E
