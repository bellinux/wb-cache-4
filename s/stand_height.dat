40|$|Abstract – The paper {{addresses}} {{two related}} issues. One is whether, and how, growth patterns of <b>stand</b> mean <b>height</b> {{have changed in}} Hungary {{in the last few}} decades, and the other is whether recently observed increases in mean annual temperature might have caused changes in growth trends. Changes in tree growth were investigated for beech (Fagus sylvatica), sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and Turkey oak (Quercus cerris) by comparing <b>stand</b> mean <b>heights</b> over age using data from the forest inventories of 1981 and 2001, and for sessile oak using <b>stand</b> mean <b>height</b> data from permanent sample plots since 1961. Tree growth was found to have accelerated for each species mentioned, with Turkey oak showing the largest acceleration. To study the second issue, <b>stand</b> mean <b>height</b> was related to elevation, wich in turn was related to mean annual temperature and precipitation. For these analyses, too, data of many thousands of stands in the forest inventory was used. <b>Stand</b> mean <b>height</b> was found to increase with decreasing elevation, i. e. with increasing mean annual temperature, {{for each of the three}} species. As the annual precipitation and air humidity decreases with decreasing elevation, it was concluded that increases of mean annual temperature could positively have affected tree growth in the last few decades. However, this effect is expected to be soon limited by water availability...|$|R
50|$|Among the {{individual}} white spruce within a <b>stand,</b> <b>height</b> growth varies greatly, {{often with a}} coefficient of variation in height of about 30% (Stiell 1955). Such variation may reflect differential expressions of check, variability within the seed lot, {{or the use of}} poorly graded stock (Stiell 1976). A fully stocked 30-year-old plantation of white spruce on a loamy fine sand underlain by silty clay loam in northern Michigan exemplifies both the variability in size of stem and their persistence.|$|E
50|$|In May 2006, the FIS {{announced}} further {{changes to}} the rules governing equipment. Beginning with the 2007-08 season, the minimum radius for GS skis was increased to 27 m for men and 23 m for women. Additionally, the minimum ski width at the waist was increased from 60 to 65 mm, and the maximum <b>stand</b> <b>height</b> for all disciplines was reduced to 50 mm. The best skiers tended to use a bigger sidecut radius, like Ted Ligety 29 m and Lindsey Vonn 27 m.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the major}} land cover issues (as with all natural {{resource}} inventories) is that every survey defines similarly named categories in different ways. For instance, there are many definitions of [...] "forest"—sometimes within the same organisation—that {{may or may not}} incorporate a number of different forest features (e.g., <b>stand</b> <b>height,</b> canopy cover, strip width, inclusion of grasses, and rates of growth for timber production).

40|$|The {{relationship}} of stand top and <b>stand</b> mean <b>height</b> {{is important for}} forest growth and yield modeling, {{but it has not}} been explored for natural mixed forests. Observations of stand top and <b>stand</b> mean <b>height</b> can present spatial dependence or autocorrelation, which should be considered in modeling. Simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models, including spatial lag model (SLM), spatial Durbin model (SDM) and spatial error model (SEM), within nine spatial weight matrices were utilized to model the stand top and <b>stand</b> mean <b>height</b> relationship in the mixed Quercus mongolica Fisch. ex Ledeb. broadleaved natural stands of Northeast China, using ordinary least squares (OLS) as a benchmark model. The results showed that there was a high linear relationship between stand top and <b>stand</b> mean <b>height</b> and that there was a positive spatial autocorrelation pattern in model residuals of OLS. Moreover, SEM and SDM performed better than OLS in terms of reducing the spatial dependence of model residuals and model fitting, regardless of which spatial weight matrix was used. SEM was better than SDM. SLM scarcely reduced the spatial autocorrelation of model residuals. Among nine spatial matrices in SEM, rook contiguous matrix performed best in model fitting, followed by inverse distances raised to the second power (1 /d 2) and local statistics model matrix (LSM) ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{areas of}} forest across {{northern}} Canada are challenging to monitor {{on a regular}} basis {{as a result of their}} large extent and remoteness. Although no forest inventory data typically exist for these northern areas, detailed and timely forest information for these areas is required to support national and international reporting obligations. We developed and tested a sample-based approach that could be used to estimate forest <b>stand</b> <b>height</b> in these remote forests using panchromatic Very High Spatial Resolution (VHSR, < 1 m) optical imagery and light detection and ranging (lidar) data. Using a study area in central British Columbia, Canada, to test our approach, we compared four different methods for estimating <b>stand</b> <b>height</b> using stand-level and crown-level metrics generated from the VHSR imagery. 'Lidar plots' (voxel-based samples of lidar data) are used for calibration and validation of the VHSR-based <b>stand</b> <b>height</b> estimates, similar to the way that field plots are used to calibrate photogrammetric estimates of <b>stand</b> <b>height</b> in a conventional forest inventory or to make empirical attribute estimates from multispectral digital remotely sensed data. A k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) method provided the best estimate of mean <b>stand</b> <b>height</b> (R- 2 = 0. 69; RMSE = 2. 3 m, RMSE normalized by the mean value of the estimates (RMSE-%) = 21) compared with linear regression, random forests, and regression tree methods. The approach presented herein demonstrates the potential of VHSR panchromatic imagery and lidar to provide robust and representative estimates of <b>stand</b> <b>height</b> in remote forest areas where conventional forest inventory approaches are either too costly or are not logistically feasible. While further evaluation of the methods is required to generalize these results over Canada to provide robust and representative estimation, VHSR and lidar data provide an opportunity for monitoring in areas for which there is no detailed forest inventory information available...|$|E

We estimated the site index of Hinoki cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa) for forest productivity using low-density airborne LiDAR. LiDAR data were acquired along a 20 -km long (100 -m wide transect {{in the eastern part}} of Shikoku Island at low density (1 pulse m- 2) and with a small footprint (20 cm). Within the transect, we set plots that included non-forest, small forest, and large forest areas, and measured tree height. Laser pulses for use in a digital canopy height model were extracted for each plot, and the following LiDAR indexes were calculated: average, maximum, minimum, 10, 20 [...] . 90 percentiles, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation. A linear regression analysis was performed between the LiDAR indexes and <b>stand</b> <b>height.</b> <b>Stand</b> <b>height</b> had the strongest relationship with the LiDAR index for the first-pulse 80 percentile.

40|$|Stem {{analysis}} was used to obtain age and height data for loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stands growing on Bowie, Fuquay, Sacul, and TroupxlsTnortheastern Texas. The soil profiles were described and bulk soil samples were taken in each sample stand. Selected physical and chemical soil properties were measured for each soil horizon. Stepwise regression {{analysis was}} used to correlate average <b>stand</b> <b>height</b> at ages 5, 10, 20, and 30 years with soil properties. Strong associations were found between <b>stand</b> <b>height</b> and properties which relate to available soil moisture holding capacity, soil permeability, and soil aeration. For Bowie, Fww, and Troup soils, average <b>stand</b> <b>height</b> increased with increasing moisture holding capacity of the surface soil and with increasing subsoil permeability and aeration. On Sacul soils, height increased with better permeability and aeration of the solum. Average annual height growth on the four soils differed significantly only in the first 5 years, peaked between ages five and 10, and then declined. Average cumulative stand heights differed significantly between series until age 10. Differences in attained height at age 25 seemed more related to rapid early growth than to differences in later growth rates...|$|E
40|$|Storm {{damage is}} {{becoming}} recognised {{as a significant}} problem in the Ovens Zone as the plantation area expands, because stands with about 1600 stems/ha on high-quality sites (>SI 27) become increasingly prone to "collapse" once the <b>stand</b> <b>height</b> exceeds 20 m. Commercial thinning before the stands become unstable is not feasible because yields are quite low (60 - 75 m 3 /ha) and piece size is small (0. 05 - 0. 08 m 3). Harvesting systems for such areas need to be specially designed to operate economically at these levels. Systems are also needed to handle smashed and tangled material until new silviculture aimed at providing more stable stands becomes effective. In the long run an approach to control appears to lie in the promotion of low "slenderness ratios", i. e., the ratio of <b>stand</b> <b>height</b> to mean diameter (in damaged stands typically in excess of 100). Lower slenderness ratios and hence more stable stands are achievable by wide initial espacements and by early non-commercial thinning.

The re-measurement phase of the Canadian NFI is an opportunity to develop novel methods for the estimation of forest attributes such as <b>stand</b> <b>height,</b> crown closure, volume, and aboveground biomass (AGB) from satellite, rather than, airborne imagery. Based on panchromatic Very High Spatial Resolution (VHSR) images and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data acquired in the Yukon Territory, Canada, we propose an approach for boreal forest stand attribute characterization. Stand and tree objects are delineated, followed by modeling of <b>stand</b> <b>height,</b> volume, and AGB using metrics derived from the stand and tree crown objects. The calibration and validation of the models are based on co-located LiDAR-derived estimates. A k-nearest neighbor approach provided the best accuracy for <b>stand</b> <b>height</b> estimation (R 2 = 0. 76, RMSE = 1. 95 m). Linear regression models were the most efficient for estimating stand volume (R 2 = 0. 94, RMSE = 9. 6 m 3 /ha) and AGB (R 2 = 0. 92, RMSE = 22. 2 t/ha). This study was implemented for one Canadian ecozone and demonstrated the capacity of a methodology to produce forest inventory attributes with acceptable accuracies offering potential to be applied to other boreal regions...|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} paper {{discusses the}} potential of low point density airborne laser scanning (ALS) data for use in forestry management. Scanning {{was carried out in}} the Rožnava Forest enterprise zone, Slovakia, with a mean laser point density of 1 point per 3 m 2. Data were processed in SCOP++ using the hierarchic robust filtering technique. Two DTMs were created from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and contour data and one DSM was created using ALS data. For forest <b>stand</b> <b>height,</b> two normalised DSMs (nDSMs) were created by subtraction of the DSM and DTM. The forest stand heights derived from these nDSMs and the application of maximum and mean zonal functions were compared with those contained in the current Forest Management Plan (FMP). The forest stand heights derived from these data and the application of maxima and mean zonal functions were compared with those contained in the current Forest management plan. The use of the mean function and the contour-derived DTM resulted in forest <b>stand</b> <b>height</b> being underestimated by approximately 3 % for stands of densities 0. 9 and 1. 0, and overestimated by 6 % for a stand density of 0. 8. Overestimation was significantly greater for lower forest stand densities: 81 % for a stand density of 0. 0 and 37 % for a density of 0. 4, with other discrepancies ranging between 15 and 30 %. Although low point density ALS should be used carefully in the determination of other forest stand parameters, this low-cost method makes it useful as a control tool for felling, measurement of disaster areas and the detection of gross errors in the FMP data. Through determination of forest <b>stand</b> <b>height,</b> tree felling in three forest stands was identified. Because of big differences between the determined forest <b>stand</b> <b>height</b> and the heights obtained from the FMP, tree felling was verified on orthoimages...|$|E
40|$|Most {{countries}} with significant forest resources have designed and implemented monitoring systems to inventory, at regular intervals, {{a range of}} forest stand attributes such as species composition, age, volume, biomass, and disturbance. These inventory systems are typically based upon the interpretation of air photos supplemented by ground measurements, with digital remotely sensed data often used to capture changes within inventory cycles. Light detection and ranging (lidar) and high spatial resolution digital satellite imagery (e. g., QuickBird) offer additional capacity and complementary data sources for inventory assessment, as demonstrated by this study over a 400 ha area on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. A range of lidar survey parameters were applied to update an existing forest inventory. Results indicate a strong relationship between the small-footprint lidar-derived heights and <b>stand</b> <b>height</b> as derived from aerial photographic interpretation (API) (R = 0. 79, p < 0. 05).
