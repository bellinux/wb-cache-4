5000|$|In Greece every court {{controls}} {{the constitutionality of}} the laws and there is no [...] "permanent" [...] Supreme Constitutional Court, as in Spain, Germany etc. If any court judges a <b>legal</b> <b>provision</b> as [...] "unconstitutional", it decides not to apply it, but it has not the power to declare the <b>legal</b> <b>provision</b> [...] "null and void". This restriction is also binding for the Supreme Courts, which declare the unconstitutional <b>legal</b> <b>provision</b> [...] "inapplicable". Nonetheless, if a case concerning the constitutionality of a law is introduced into the Supreme Special Court (after the issuing of contradictory decisions of the Supreme Courts), the Court has the constitutional right to declare an unconstitutional <b>legal</b> <b>provision</b> as [...] "powerless". This means that the unconstitutional <b>legal</b> <b>provision</b> still exists (it is not formally [...] "null and void"), but it is expelled from the Greek [...] "law and order".|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} planned damages actions for {{breaches}} of EC antitrust law {{in order to}} assess their impact on consumer welfare. It first examines the current legal situation and concurs that the European Union needs to regulate damages actions for breaches of EC antitrust law so that a higher number of consumers could be compensated for their losses. This paper then discusses the main <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> proposed by the Commission in the Green and in the White paper on damages actions for breaches of EC antitrust law. The analysis of these proposed <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> is done using arguments specific to the economic analysis of law. It is demonstrated that most of these proposed <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> will enhance consumer welfare but that there are also proposed <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> which will damage consumer welfare. The paper concludes that the planned damages actions for breaches of the EC law will be an improvement compared to the current situation. However, the Commission should amend some of the proposed <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> in order to help consumers further...|$|R

40|$|Constitutions {{help define}} {{domestic}} political orders, but {{are known to}} be influenced by two international mechanisms: one that reflects global temporal trends in legal development, and another that reflects international network dynamics such as shared colonial history. We introduce the provision space; the growing set of all <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> existing in the world's constitutions over time. Through this we uncover a third mechanism influencing constitutional change: hierarchical dependencies between <b>legal</b> <b>provisions,</b> under which the adoption of essential, fundamental provisions precedes more advanced provisions. This third mechanism appears to play an especially important role in the emergence of new political rights, and may therefore provide a useful roadmap for advocates of those rights. We further characterise each <b>legal</b> <b>provision</b> in terms of the strength of these mechanisms...|$|R
