Baseline (noninduced) SCE values differ significantly among strains, 129 /ReJ having the lowest and DBA/ 2 having the highest mean SCE per cell values. In general, the baseline SCE {{of a given}} F 1 is {{within the range of}} its corresponding parental strains or near the lower parental value. Furthermore, there is a genotype-dependent increase in mean SCEs per cell with CP dose. Strain differences in <b>SCE</b> <b>induction</b> are noted particularly at the two higher CP doses (4. 50 and 45. 0 mg/kg). In general, F 1 hybrids involving a strain with high induced SCEs and a strain with low induced SCEs exhibit mean SCE values that are closer to the value of the lower strain. F 1 s involving two strains with high SCEs or two strains with low SCEs yield SCEs not different from parental strains.

Previous work in this area, with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, has shown the (6 - 4) lesion to be more important than the (5 - 6) lesion in affecting cell survival, DNA synthesis, mutation and sister chromatid exchange (<b>SCE)</b> <b>induction.</b> We used CHO cells AA 8 (repair-proficient in removing both lesions), UV 61 (removes only the (6 - 4) and not the (5 - 6) lesions) and UV 5 (removes neither lesion). Cell survival studies showed UV 5 cells were more sensitive to ultraviolet light (UV) than UV 61 cells. DNA synthesis studies showed a fluence dependent effect. The (6 - 4) lesion played a greater role than the (5 - 6) in decreasing DNA synthesis at 2. 5 J/m². At 5 and 10 J/m², the (5 - 6) lesion played a greater role in inhibiting DNA synthesis than seen at 2. 5 J/m². DNA chain elongation was studied by using DNA fiber autoradiography. Our results indicated the (5 - 6) lesion did not form long-term blocks to DNA chain elongation. DNA fiber autoradiography was also used to detect and measure the activation of alternative sites of initiation. The (5 - 6) lesion did activate alternative sites. This activation remained longer than that seen in AA 8 cells but was removed by 5 hrs.

40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study {{investigated}} the antioxidant activities and hepatoprotective effects of Schisandra chinensis Baillon extract (SCE) against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) -induced oxidative hepatic damage in rats. MATERIALS/METHODS: Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were pretreated with SCE (300, 600, and 1, 200 mg/kg BW) or saline once daily for 14 consecutive days. On day 14, each animal, except those belonging to the normal control group, were injected with t-BHP (0. 8 mmol/kg BW/i. p.), {{and all of the}} rats were sacrificed 16 h after t-BHP injection. RESULTS: Although no significant differences in AST and ALT levels were observed among the TC and SCE groups, the high-dose SCE group showed a decreasing tendency compared to the TC group. However, erythrocyte SOD activity showed {{a significant increase in the}} low-dose SCE group compared with the TC group. On the other hand, no significant differences in hepatic total glutathione (GSH) level, glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were observed among the TC and SCE groups. Hepatic histopathological evaluation revealed that pretreatment with SCE resulted in reduced t-BHP-induced incidence of lesions, such as neutrophil infiltration, swelling of liver cells, and necrosis. In particular, treatment with a high dose of <b>SCE</b> resulted in <b>induction</b> of phase II antioxidant/detoxifying enzyme expression, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC).

40|$|Technical {{variables}} in lymphocyte culture, harvest and differential staining were investigated for {{their effect on}} baseline sister chromatid exchange (SCE) levels. The culture medium, 5 Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) concentration and method of differential staining all influenced SCE frequency, whereas the method of lymphocyte separation, the mitogen utilized and the timing of BrdUrd addition did not. Repeat cultures scored for SCE at varying time intervals {{during the course of}} this study showed that for most individuals, baseline SCE levels were constant over time. <b>SCE</b> <b>induction</b> was studied using a range of chemical and physical agents differing in their interactions with DNA. The results suggested that a variety of DNA interactions culminated in SCE formation. SCE analysis appeared a useful technique for assessing many, but not all, classes of chromosome damaging agents and therefore is best used in conjunction with other test systems in assessing DNA damaging agents. Different experimental protocols were utilized to investigate <b>SCE</b> <b>induction.</b> Induced exchange levels varied considerably between resting (Go) lymphocytes and replicating lymphocytes, and between replicating lymphocytes that had incorporated BrdUrd prior to chemical or physical challenge and those lymphocytes that had not. It appeared that incorporation of BrdUrd into chromosomal DNA increased lymphocyte sensitivity to damage by most agents. These factors should be considered when assessing induced SCEs and a testing schedule is described which would take these {{variables in}}to account. The effect of X irradiation on baseline SCE frequency was studied in detail. X irradiation caused a small but significant increase in SCEs. Although incorporation of BrdUrd sensitizes chromosomes to damage by ionizing radiation, increased BrdUrd concentrations in the culture medium did not lead to an increase in X-ray induced SCEs. Results from post irradiation holding experiments suggested that SCEs represent a form of DNA repair. This SCE repair was thought to operate on residual damage not repaired by other DNA repair mechanisms. A comparison was made between the frequency of induced SCEs in human lymphocytes and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.

They also exhibited three- to fourfold increases in spontaneous frequency of chromosome aberrations (CAs). To {{determine whether the}} high level of SCE frequency in AC 12 is caused by 5 -bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) used for visualizing SCEs, the effect of BrdUrd incorporated into DNA on <b>SCE</b> <b>induction</b> was analyzed. The SCE frequencies in AC 12 remained constant at BrdUrd incorporation levels corresponding to 2 – 90 % substitution for thymidine in DNA. In addition, the small amount of BrdUrd incorporated into both daughter and parental DNA strands in AC 12 had minimal effect on <b>SCE</b> <b>induction.</b> Furthermore, AC 12 and AC 41 were slightly resistant to BrdUrd with respect to the induction of CAs, the inhibition of cell-cycle progression and the decrease in mitotic activity. These findings suggest that the high incidence of SCEs in AC 12 and AC 41 is formed by their intrinsic defects, not by the effects of BrdUrd used. The analysis of SCE frequencies in hybrid cells between these mutants and the parental L 5178 Y revealed that the genetic defects in AC 12 and AC 41 appear to be recessive, and that these two mutants belong to the same complementation group. Furthermore, AC 12 belonged to a different complementation group from ES 4, which was isolated previously from L 5178 Y as an SCE mutant with a twofold higher frequency of spontaneous SCEs.

Concen-trations of the DNA alkylation products were measured or calculated at 11 DNA base sites {{and at the}} phosphodiester bond. Ethyl methanesulfonate, N-methyl- and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea produced com-parable concentrations (3. 3 to 3. 5 /tmol product/mol DNA phosphate) of O 6 -alkylguanine.

Since alkylation at O 6 of guanine has been positively correlated with mutagenesis in V- 79 cells, these findings support the suggestion that SCE and mutagenesis can result from a common DNA lesion. Methyl methane-sulfonate (MMS) produced very little O^-methyl-guanine, but did produce 3 -methylthymine and 3 -methyladenine, either of which might account for the MMS-induced SCE.

Obviously, since only 25 compounds were examined, assessment was rather uncertain, and the subdivision of the set into subsets for different chemical classes would have generated groups too small for a meaningful statistical analysis. With a much larger set (80 compounds) we hoped to be able to discriminate different predictivities for different chemical classes. This seems important because the test could be much more suitable for one given class than for another. Previous investigations with different short-term tests have shown that these differences can indeed exist and be very great. In this respect it is potentially very encouraging that the test considered here showed a fair correlation with carcinogenic potency for aromatic amines. Many other tests that we have examined so far have shown little or no predictivity for this important class of chemicals...|$|E
40|$|Frequencies of {{baseline}} and cyclophosphamide-induced sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) were measured in mouse maternal and fetal cells between days 11 and 19 of gestation. Baseline levels of SCE did not vary {{as a function}} of gestational age in either the mother or fetus. Cyclophosphamide-induced SCE frequencies remained constant in maternal cells but declined dramatically in the fetus throughout the latter half of development. Because cyclophosphamide is a metabolically activated mutagen, a direct-acting drug, mitomycin C, was given on days 11 and 15 to determine if the decline in induced SCE levels seen with gestational results from alterations in activating enzymes. A similar decline in mitomycin C-induced SCE levels was noted in fetal tissues {{as a function of}} gestational age. Dose-response curves to cyclophosphamide performed on day 13 of gestation showed increases in SCE as a function of cyclophosphamide concentration in both the mother and the fetus. When mutagen-induced SCE levels were compared in different fetal organs, the direct-acting drugs (mitomycin C and daunomycin) were found to induce similar levels in all tissues. Cyclophosphamide, which is metabolically activated, induced higher SCE levels in fetal liver than in lung or gut. Whereas cyclophosphamide induced similar SCE levels in fetal and maternal cells on day 13 of gestation, daunomycin produced fetal SCE levels that were approximately 50 % of maternal levels. Simultaneous measurement of the distribution of [14 C]cyclophosphamide and [3 H]daunomycin in maternal and fetal cells revealed that the lower <b>SCE</b> <b>induction</b> by daunomycin was probably due to decreased ability to cross the placental barrier...|$|E
40|$|Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are {{the first}} {{proteins}} involved in cellular DNA repair pathways to be targeted by specific inhibitors for clinical benefit. Tumors harboring genetic defects in homologous recombination (HR), a DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway, are hypersensitive to PARP inhibitors (PARPi). Early phase clinical trials with PARPi have been promising in patients with advanced BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 -associated breast, ovary and prostate cancer and have led to limited approval for treatment of BRCA-deficient ovary cancer. Unlike HR-defective cells, HR-proficient cells manifest very low cytotoxicity when exposed to PARPi, although they mount a DNA damage response. However, the genotoxic effects on normal human cells when agents including PARPi disturb proficient cellular repair processes have not been substantially investigated. We quantified cytogenetic alterations of human cells, including primary lymphoid cells and non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic epithelial cell lines, exposed to PARPi at clinically relevant doses by both sister chromatid exchange (SCE) assays and chromosome spreading. As expected, both olaparib and veliparib effectively inhibited poly-ADP-ribosylation (PAR), and caused marked hypersensitivity in HR-deficient cells. Significant dose-dependent increases in SCEs were observed in normal and non-tumorigenic cells with minimal residual PAR activity. Clinically relevant doses of the FDA-approved olaparib led to a marked increase of SCEs (5 - 10 -fold) and chromatid aberrations (2 - 6 -fold). Furthermore, olaparib potentiated <b>SCE</b> <b>induction</b> by cisplatin in normal human cells. Our data {{have important implications for}} therapies with regard to sustained genotoxicity to normal cells. Genomic instability arising from PARPi warrants consideration, especially if these agents will be used in people with early stage cancers, in prevention strategies or for non-oncologic indications...|$|E
40|$|Polymorphisms of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, {{responsible}} for {{individual differences in}} metabolic activation and detoxification reactions, may profoundly modulate the effects of chemical carcinogens. In the case of genotoxic carcinogens, differences in biological effects due to genetic polymorphisms can be evaluated by cytogenetic methods such as the analysis of chromosomal aberrations (CAs), sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), micronuclei (MN), and changes in chromosome number. These techniques {{can be applied to}} any exposure known to induce such alterations, without additional method development for each exposing agent. The influence of polymorphic genes on the cytogenetic effects of a carcinogen can quickly be tested in vitro using metabolically competent cells collected from donors representing different genotypes or phenotypes. For instance, erythrocytes from individuals positive for glutathione S-transferase T 1 (GSTT 1) express GSTT 1, whereas GSTT 1 -null donors, having a homozygous deletion of the GSTT 1 gene, completely lack this detoxification enzyme. This deficiency results in highly increased sensitivity to <b>SCE</b> <b>induction</b> in whole-blood lymphocyte cultures by 1, 2 : 3, 4 -diepoxybutane, a reactive metabolite of 1, 3 -butadiene. The same cytogenetic techniques can also be applied as effect biomarkers in studies of human populations exposed to genotoxic carcinogens. For example, elevated rates of chromosome damage have been detected among smokers lacking glutathione S-transferase M 1 (GSTM 1 -null genotype), and the baseline level of SCEs seems to be increased in GSTT 1 -null individuals. Information obtained from cytogenetic studies of genetic polymorphisms can be used, for example, to recognize the genotoxically relevant substrates of the polymorphic enzymes, to identify genotypes that are susceptible to these genotoxins, to improve in vitro genotoxicity tests utilizing human cells, to increase the sensitivity of cytogenetic endpoints as biomarkers of genotoxic effects in humans, and to direct mechanistic studies and cancer epidemiology...|$|E
40|$|Methods {{currently}} used in human cytogenetics were investigated for their suitability with fish cell lines to enable high-quality chromosome preparations {{to be easily}} obtained, allowing characterisation and use in mutagenicity testing. Six fish cell lines were grown using traditional cell culture techniques. The arresting, harvesting, fixing and spreading techniques used in human cytogenetics were investigated to determine the most suitable method of chromosome preparation. Cell synchronisation techniques were also investigated but {{were found to be}} unreliable in producing prometaphase chromosomes. Initial characterisation of the cell lines was carried out, and variation observed between the cell lines in growth rate, mitotic rate, chromosome number and chromosome size. A number of chromosome banding techniques were investigated, including G-banding, C-banding, Q-banding, Hoechst 33258 staining, silver staining and sister chromatid differentiation. Methods previously applied to both mammalian and fish chromosomes were adapted in an attempt to obtain reproducible results. The suitability of each of the cell lines for use in mutagenicity testing was assessed by exposure to EMS. The effects of EMS concentration on growth, mitotic rate, chromosome structure and SCE frequency observed in a number of the cell lines. A dose-dependent response was produced, however, levels of chromosome breakage were very low. In contrast, increases in SCE frequency were observed at significantly lower concentrations of EMS than was required to produce chromosome breakage, suggesting that <b>SCE</b> <b>induction</b> may be a more sensitive indicator of mutagenic activity than chromosome breakage. Areas requiring further investigation include: (i) the use of other types of mutagenicity test such as the anaphase aberration test, DNA-repair synthesis and micronucleus formation. (ii) the response of cell lines to a known chemical mutagen requiring metabolic activation. (iii) the response of cells to chemicals of unknown mutagenic activity in a number of mutagenicity tests...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous and diepoxybutane (DEB) -induced sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) were {{examined}} in whole-blood lymphocyte cultures of 3 men and 4 women. A strong increase in mean number of SCEs per cell with increasing DEB concentrations (0, 2, and 4 microM) was observed in cultures of all subjects, but 3 of the donors were clearly more sensitive than the others. The SCE measurements were repeated 2 - 6 times per donor {{over a period of}} 55 months to assess the stability of the individual SCE response. The results showed that <b>SCE</b> <b>induction</b> by DEB was steady in the individuals during the follow-up at each DEB dose, with no significant differences among the repeated experiments. At 4 microM DEB, the DEB-sensitive and -resistant donors could be reliably be differentiated from each other in all trials. As DEB-sensitivity has been suggested to be {{due to the lack of}} glutathione S-transferase (GST) T 1, the donors were genotyped for the presence of GSTT 1 and GSTM 1 genes. The 3 individuals found to be DEB-sensitive were all of the GSTT 1 null genotype, whereas the 4 DEB-resistant donors were GSTT 1 positive, which supported the role of the GSTT 1 gene in determining DEB-sensitivity. Three of the DEB-resistant and none of the DEB-sensitive had the GSTM 1 null genotype. Thus, the lack of the GSTM 1 gene was not associated with the DEB-sensitivity trait. In conclusion, the present findings show that individual SCE responses to treatment of cultured human lymphocytes with DEB can reliably be reproduced in repeated trials. The results confirm that the GSTT 1 gene but not the GSTM 1 gene is important in determining individual sensitivity to the in vitro genotoxicity of DEB...|$|E
40|$|Human is daily {{exposed to}} complex {{mixtures}} of pesticides either occupationally or incidentally, with different {{direct or indirect}} health side-effects. Many pesticides {{have been identified as}} extremely toxic to humans, while others as possible or potent carcinogens. In the present thesis we investigated the in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity of two pesticides: Imidacloprid and Metalaxyl, separately and in combination. Imidacloprid is a broad-spectrum insecticide belonging to the group of neonicotinoids, and Metalaxyl is a systemic benzenoid fungicide. For the evaluation of the genotoxicity of the selected pesticides we used the following cytogenetic end-points: the micronucleus (MN) formation and sister-chromatid exchange (<b>SCE)</b> <b>induction</b> in human lymphocytes and the micronucleus induction in polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) of the rat bone-marrow. The results obtained from the analysis of micronuclei in the lymphocytes of 11 farmers, before and after spraying the specific pesticides, and from their comparison with the spontaneous induction of micronuclei in the lymphocytes of 11 negative controls, showed that there are no statistically significant differences in the micronuclei frequencies of our studied groups before and after spraying. Analysis on the basis of smokers versus non-smokers, for negative controls, as well as for farmers, did not show statistically significant differences. Analysis between control and exposed farmers revealed a significant difference after the exposure to these pesticides. The results of the MN analysis in lymphocyte cultures treated in vitro with the two pesticides, either separately or as a mixture, did not significantly differ from those in the controls. The results of the SCE analysis showed a statistically significant increase in SCE frequency resulting from treatments with Metalaxyl at 5, 10 and 100 μg/ml and with the combination of Imidacloprid and Metalaxyl at 100 and 200 μg/ml. Finally, the in vivo micronucleus assay with rat bone-marrow polychromatic erythrocytes showed a statistically significant effect upon separate treatments with Imidacloprid and Metalaxyl at doses of 300 mg/kg b. w. or upon combined treatment with 200 and 400 mg/kg b. w. ...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{undertaken}} to measure genetic toxicity {{at the molecular}} and cytogenetic levels of biological organisation in marine invertebrates and flatfish. The responses in the early life stages and adult life stages of marine invertebrates (Mytilus edulis and Platynereis dumerilii) were measured following exposures to the physical agent ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and representative compounds of the chemical group, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in laboratory conditions. Also, the potential changes of toxicity of PAH contaminants caused by interactive effects with UVR were evaluated. In a collaborative study with researchers at the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS), genotoxic measurements were carried out in marine flounder (Platichthys flesus) which had been chronically exposed in vivo to PAHs administered via their food in controlled laboratory conditions. Significantly elevated levels of DNA damage were only observed in fish exposed to the highest PAH concentrations. Dose-dependent cytogenetic responses were observed in the early life stages of both of the invertebrate species investigated following exposure to UVR. However, statistically significant increases in chromosomal aberration induction and sister chromatid exchange (<b>SCE)</b> <b>induction,</b> and decreases in proliferation rate index (PRI) and normal development were only observed at UVR levels exceeding that of equivalent environmentally realistic conditions, when related to historical and predicted ozone levels in the south west of England. The interactive effects of UVR and PAHs indicated that the genotoxic potential of PAHs is increased when photoactivation takes place, measured by increases in genotoxic responses in both the early and adult life stages. Following a series of laboratory studies, a field study was conducted whereby indigenous populations of marine invertebrates {Mytilus edulis and Cerastoderma edule) were used as target organisms. Haemolymph samples were collected from the animals and tested for genotoxic and cytotoxic effects, employing assays validated in the earlier laboratory studies. Correlations between samples showing high levels of DNA damage measured with the comet assay and sites {{with high levels of}} heavy metals in the sediments and soft tissue of the animals were established. Finally, an attempt was made to evaluate the DNA repair capabilities of haemocytes collected from M. edulis, A series of in vitro exposures were carried out using hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) an oxidising agent, and methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) an alkylating agent to induce DNA damage. These were incubated with cytosine β-D-arabino furanoside (AraC), to establish whether these cells had the capacity to repair DNA damage induced by the model chemicals. The results showed that DNA damage induced by H 2 O 2 required DNA polymerases for repair, whereas MMS-induced damage and repair {{did not appear to be}} affected by the presence of AraC. In conclusion, the data collated from the research undertaken for this project showed that UVR and PAHs are able to induce genotoxic lesions measurable at the cytogenetic level and whole organism levels in early life stages; and at the molecular and cellular levels in the adult stages. The assays employed appeared to be useful for identifying potential "hotspots" for genotoxic agents in the environment as indicated by the results of the field study, however, the endpoints measured are not contaminant-specific and provide little information about the type of contaminant or agent which might be present. Nonetheless, it has been shown here that comet assay is applicable to different marine species (including Cerastoderma edule and Platichthys flesus) and it is a potentially useful method for detecting DNA damage as well as DNA repair.
