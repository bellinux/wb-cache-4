25|$|Forgetting the raw gas {{burns on}} his own arm, Haile Selassie retired into his Palace for a final conference with his chieftains. It was clear {{to him that the}} Government of the Ethiopian Empire would have to move from Addis Ababa. One {{possibility}} was for the government to relocate to Gore in the southwest and he sought comment on this plan. Initially his bearded chiefs said nothing at all. But, when the chiefs did talk, they explained that the one effective Ethiopian army left was fighting for its life under Ras Nasibu Emmanual in the Ogaden. This army was pitted against General Rodolfo Graziani's relentless advance on Harar. They added that the tribes to the west were in an ugly mood. One after another, the chiefs rose to tell how hopeless the situation was and to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> nothing for the Emperor to do but run for his life.|$|E
500|$|Astronomer Seth Shostak {{served as}} {{scientific}} consultant on the film, reviewed the script several times for errors, gave suggestions {{for making the}} scientists appear less dry, and noted that they would refer to one another on a first-name basis. He said, [...] "Real scientists don't describe an object entering the solar system as 'notable {{for the fact that}} it was not moving in an asteroidal ellipse, but moving at nearly three times ten to the seventh meters per second.' More likely, they would <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> 'a goddamned rock headed our way!'" ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{features}} a musical score by Aaron Zigman, {{who was hired}} after Alison Krauss {{backed out of the}} job. Zigman mentioned that there are similarities between the music he composed for Bridge to Terabithia and the film Flicka in that [...] "...at times there's a bit of a Celtic influence but not much", but he also went on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a more modern feel to the music he composed for Bridge to Terabithia. He did so as Csupó requested him to do not compose [...] "your typical Hollywood Score"; he then mixed up orchestral melody with [...] "a bit of a modern flavor." [...] The score he composed for the film is described as [...] "very large" [...] compared to his other work, and Zigman commented that [...] "Aside from the minimalist stuff and coloring that I love to do, I also like big orchestral stuff, and want to do more of that, and this film enabled me to spread my wings out a bit." [...] The official soundtrack for the film was released as Music from and Inspired by Bridge to Terabithia by Hollywood Records on February 13, 2007.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with the traditional view of Aristotle, the Hellenistic Greeks generally preferred to distinguish the potential infinity from the actual infinity; for example, instead of <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> an infinity of primes, Euclid prefers instead to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> more prime numbers than contained in any given collection of prime numbers.|$|R

Collins <b>says</b> <b>that</b> Riggs beat Budge in a tour; McCauley <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no long tour, {{only a short}} one between Riggs and Frank Kovacs. Tom LeCompte <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a small tour with Riggs {{overcoming}} Budge 12-6 followed by the short Riggs-Kovacs tour (4-3, but 11-10 according to McCauley).|$|R

500|$|In his 1987 {{review of}} the album for Rolling Stone magazine, music {{journalist}} J. D. Considine described Latham's production of the album as [...] "ineffectual" [...] and [...] "well mannered". He went on <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no [...] "anxious energy or knife-edged irony that made the group's earlier albums so compelling". He finishes his review by saying the album is [...] "as vacant as it is pretty". Reviewing the 2003 remastered album, Andrew Harrison for Blender magazine's website said, [...] "Egomania and off-message electronics experiments sank their eponymous 1987 comedown..." [...] Taking a more positive stance, David Cleary for AllMusic describes the album as [...] "the hookiest and most memorable the band would ever write". Having described de Freitas's drumming as solid and veering toward the danceable, and McCulloch's singing as [...] "restrained and tasteful", Cleary added that [...] "The production values were excellent, with many subtle touches that do not detract from the album's overall directness." [...] Although he stated that the production [...] "watered the band's sound down", Joe Tangari for Pitchfork Media said, [...] "The band's attempt to reach a wider audience worked out." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{same goes}} for the story about king Khafre. He is {{depicted}} as the direct follower of Khufu and as likewise evil and that he ruled for 56 years. In chapter 127–128 Herodotus writes: [...] "After Khéops was dead his brother Khéphrên succeeded to the royal throne. This king followed the same manner as the other... and ruled for 56years. Here they reckon altogether 106years, during which they <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> nothing but evil for the Egyptians, and the temples were kept closed and not opened during all that time".|$|E
2500|$|Speaking to The Jerusalem Post, Jack Straw {{strongly}} denied {{claims that}} his criticism was anti-Semitic.

He pointed out that Wilf did not claim that he had embarked on an anti-Semitic diatribe, as had been claimed in many of the media reports.

2500|$|A {{turning point}} of his artistic life came when he first noticed a fellow student drawing. Baal-Teshuva writes that for the young Chagall, {{watching}} someone draw [...] "was like a vision, a revelation in black and white". Chagall would later <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no art of any kind in his family's home and the concept was totally alien to him. When Chagall asked the schoolmate how he learned to draw, his friend replied, [...] "Go and find a book in the library, idiot, choose any picture you like, and just copy it". He soon began copying images from books and found the experience so rewarding he then {{decided he wanted to}} become an artist.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} on the independent U.S. news broadcaster Democracy Now, Norman Finkelstein questioned the way the report judged the events in Gaza based on the laws of war, saying that Gaza {{did not meet the}} criteria of a war zone, calling it instead a [...] "massacre". He went on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no fighting in Gaza, and referred to quotes from the testimonies of the Israeli soldiers published in the report by NGO Breaking the Silence. Concerning the substance of the report, Finkelstein says the Goldstone report is in-line with reports compiled by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch in the findings that Israel had targeted civilians and the Palestinian infrastructure.|$|E
