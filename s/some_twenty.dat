5|$|For <b>some</b> <b>twenty</b> years, Teller advised Israel {{on nuclear}} matters in general, {{and on the}} {{building}} of a hydrogen bomb in particular. In 1952, Teller and Oppenheimer had a long meeting with David Ben-Gurion in Tel Aviv, telling him {{that the best way to}} accumulate plutonium was to burn natural uranium in a nuclear reactor. Starting in 1964, a connection between Teller and Israel was made by the physicist Yuval Ne'eman, who had similar political views. Between 1964 and 1967, Teller visited Israel six times, lecturing at Tel Aviv University, and advising the chiefs of Israel's scientific-security circle as well as prime ministers and cabinet members.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of his conquests, Alexander founded <b>some</b> <b>twenty</b> cities that bore his name, most of them east of the Tigris. The first, and greatest, was Alexandria in Egypt, which would become one of the leading Mediterranean cities. The cities' {{locations}} reflected trade routes as well as defensive positions. At first, the cities must have been inhospitable, little more than defensive garrisons. Following Alexander's death, many Greeks who had settled there tried to return to Greece. However, a century or so after Alexander's death, many of the Alexandrias were thriving, with elaborate public buildings and substantial populations that included both Greek and local peoples.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's legacy {{includes}} the cultural diffusion and syncretism which his conquests engendered, such as Greco-Buddhism. He founded <b>some</b> <b>twenty</b> cities that bore his name, most notably Alexandria in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists {{and the resulting}} spread of Greek culture in the east resulted in a new Hellenistic civilization, aspects of which were still evident in {{the traditions of the}} Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century AD and the presence of Greek speakers in central and far eastern Anatolia until the 1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mold of Achilles, and he features prominently in the history and mythic traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. He became the measure against which military leaders compared themselves, and military academies throughout the world still teach his tactics. He is often ranked among the most influential people in history.|$|E
5|$|Every year Reading {{hosts the}} Reading Festival, {{which has been}} running since 1971.

5|$|Fort Lauderdale's {{first major}} {{development}} {{began in the}} 1920s, during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. The 1926 Miami Hurricane and the Great Depression of the 1930s caused {{a great deal of}} economic dislocation. In July 1935, an African-American man named Rubin Stacy was accused of robbing a white woman at knife point. He was arrested and being transported to a Miami jail when police were run off the road by a mob. A group of 100 white men proceeded to hang Stacy from a tree near the scene of his alleged robbery. His body was riddled with <b>some</b> <b>twenty</b> bullets. The murder was subsequently used by the press in Nazi Germany to discredit US critiques of its own persecution of Jews, Communists, and Catholics.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} of {{events that led to}} Davis' capture began early in May 1865, when the 4th Michigan Cavalry was set up in an encampment of tents at Macon, Georgia. The military unit of several battalions was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin D. Pritchard. On May 7, he was given orders to join many other units searching for the Confederate president. Pritchard's troops scouted through the country along the Ocmulgee River, and by the next day the Michiganders had come to Hawkinsville, Georgia, about fifty miles south of Macon, from where they continued along the river to Abbeville, Georgia. There, Pritchard learned from Lieutenant Colonel Henry Harnden that his First Wisconsin Cavalry was hot on Davis's trail. After a meeting between the two colonels, Harnden and his men headed off towards Irwinville, <b>some</b> <b>twenty</b> miles south of their position.|$|E
