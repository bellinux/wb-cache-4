40|$|<b>Silicon</b> <b>steels</b> {{are widely}} used for their {{electrical}} applications in motors, generators, small transformer cores due to their high permeability, low core losses and their uniform magnetic properties in all directions of the material. The major processing steps involved {{for the production of}} <b>silicon</b> <b>steels</b> are hot rolling, cold rolling and annealing. The processing steps largely affect the texture of these steels which subsequently improves the electrical properties of these steels. The objective of the present study is to investigate the cross-rolling effect on texture development of <b>silicon</b> <b>steels</b> and its magnetic/electrical properties. X- ray Diffraction (XRD) method is carried out on the sample to understand the textural development. PC based Pulse Field Hysteresis Loop Tester is used to estimate the magnetic properties.

40|$|Several kinetic {{models for}} bainite {{transformation}} {{have been widely}} applied in industry and research. The majority of these models, that do not consider the effect of cementite precipitation during bainite transformation, were validated in high <b>silicon</b> bainitic <b>steels</b> {{in order to avoid}} the interference of cementite precipitation during bainite formation. In this work, displacive models for bainite transformation have been validated in bainitic <b>steels</b> with different <b>silicon</b> content with the aim of evaluating their applicability on steels where cementite precipitation may play an important role on bainite formation. It has been found that these models fail in the calculus of the maximum volume fraction of bainite of lean <b>silicon</b> <b>steels,</b> but lead to a reasonable accuracy in high <b>silicon</b> <b>steels.</b> This is not surprising since cementite formation reduces the carbon content in the residual austenite, stimulating the formation of a further quantity of ferrite. Likewise, an imprecise estimation of the nucleation rate of bainite must be the reason for the poor correlation in the predictions of the bainite transformation kinetics in high <b>silicon</b> <b>steels.</b> This entails a better treatment of autocatalytic nucleation, still unresolved issue in the bainite transformation kinetics theory.

40|$|Abstract: Sensors {{based on}} the giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) effect in <b>silicon</b> <b>steels</b> were constructed. Strips of <b>silicon</b> <b>steels</b> (0. 500 mm-thick, 35. 0 mm-long) with widths ranging from 0. 122 to 1. 064 mm were cut from {{recycled}} transformer cores. Since a maximum GMI ratio of 300 % and a maximum field sensitivity of 1. 5 %/Oe were observed in a 1. 064 mm-wide sample at 200 kHz, the 1. 064 mm-wide strips were chosen as sensing elements in a slot key switch, angular velocity sensor, current sensor and force sensor. The sensing elements were integrated into electronic circuits and the changes in impedance were monitored. Variations in voltage due to these changes were typically small and must therefore be amplified by the electronic circuits. For the current sensor and force sensor, the variation in the voltage drop across the GMI sensing element had non-linear variations with either current or force and a conversion formula from a computer program was therefore needed. The performance of the systems was tested. These sensing systems were stable, highly sensitive, hysteresis-free and could be produced on a mass scale. Based on their GMI effect, the <b>silicon</b> <b>steels</b> are versatile alternative low-cost sensors...|$|R
40|$|A {{new model}} for the overall {{kinetics}} of the bainite transformation has been validated experimentally. The new model, presented in the 1 st part of this work, is based in the displacive mechanism for bainite transformation. Thus, the bainite transformation kinetics of three medium carbon-high <b>silicon</b> <b>steels</b> has been studied. Results show that the model, which does not consider the effect of carbide precipitation in the bainite kinetics, predicts {{with a high degree}} of agreement the time evolution of bainitic ferrite volume fraction, even when lower bainite is present at the microstructure. Data from two additional medium carbon-high <b>silicon</b> <b>steels,</b> frequently reported in the literature, have been also used for reinforcing the validation, obtaining, again, a high agreement between the kinetic results for bainite transformation predicted by the model and those obtained expenmentally. © 2006 The Japan Institute of Metals.

40|$|The {{intention}} {{of the present study}} is to review and compare the effect of various well-studied alloying elements on the microstructure and soft magnetic properties of the Fe-based amorphous/nanocrystalline system. The state-of-the-art Fe-based amorphous/nanocrystalline alloys have been developed because of their unique soft magnetic properties such as low core loss, high permeability(10 4 - 10 5 at 1 kHz) and low magnetostriction (< 10 ppm) as compared to conventional <b>silicon</b> <b>steels</b> which are also called electrical steels. In Fe-based amorphous/nanocrystalline system, the chemical composition and microstructural features particularly grain size play an indispensable role on the saturated magnetization (B s) and coercivity (H c) values. An ideal Fe-based soft magnetic material is defined as a material possessing higher B s and lower H c. The problem of the new material is its low B s value (for commercial material is 1. 4 T) than <b>silicon</b> <b>steels</b> (≈ 2 T). In addition to B s content of new material, many {{attempts have been made to}} reduce the H c value which could be achieved via a decrease of grain size (< 50 nm). To reach this goal (B s ↑ and H c ↓), the effect of a variety of elements on the microstructure, crystallization process and soft magnetic properties of the Fe-based amorphous/nanocrystalline alloys has been investigated so far. The aim of all these studies is to find an appropriate replacement for conventional <b>silicon</b> <b>steels</b> because of their high core loss and low permeability. Effect of alloying elements including Si, B, Cu, Nb, Zr, N-doping, P, Ni, Co, H-doping, Ge and W on the microstructure and magnetic properties is the main subject of this study in order to shed light on the dependence of magnetic properties with composition and grain size. © 2014 Elsevier B.

50|$|A small {{addition}} of silicon to iron (around 3%) {{results in a}} dramatic increase of the resistivity of the metal, up to four times higher. The higher resistivity reduces the eddy currents, so <b>silicon</b> <b>steel</b> is used in transformer cores. Further increase in silicon concentration impairs the steel's mechanical properties, causing difficulties for rolling due to brittleness.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{two types}} of <b>silicon</b> <b>steel,</b> {{grain-oriented}} (GO) and grain non-oriented (GNO), GO is most desirable for magnetic cores. It is anisotropic, offering better magnetic properties than GNO in one direction. As the magnetic field in inductor and transformer cores is always along the same direction, it is an advantage to use grain oriented steel in the preferred orientation. Rotating machines, where the direction of the magnetic field can change, gain no benefit from grain-oriented steel.|$|E

5000|$|Bitter {{patterns}} are a technique for imaging magnetic domains that were first observed by Francis Bitter. [...] The technique involves placing a small quantity of ferrofluid {{on the surface}} of a ferromagnetic material. The ferrofluid arranges itself along magnetic domain walls, which have higher magnetic flux than the regions of the material located within domains.A modified Bitter technique has been incorporated into a widely used device, the Large Area Domain Viewer, which is particularly useful in the examination of grain-oriented <b>silicon</b> <b>steels.</b>|$|R

The rotor {{consists of}} soft magnetic material, such as laminated <b>silicon</b> <b>steel,</b> which has multiple projections acting as salient magnetic poles through magnetic reluctance. For switched reluctance motors, the number of rotor poles is typically less {{than the number of}} stator poles, which minimizes torque ripple and prevents the poles from all aligning simultaneously—a position which cannot generate torque.|$|E
5000|$|Hysteresis losses: Reversing the {{direction}} of magnetization of the magnetic domains in the core material each cycle causes energy loss, because of the coercivity of the material. These losses are called hysteresis. The energy lost per cycle {{is proportional to the}} area of the hysteresis loop in the BH graph.

40|$|MasterRotating {{field is}} {{generated}} in the iron core of induction motors. The AC field causes iron losses: hysteresis loss and eddy current loss. For the variable speed control, PWM technique should be used. But the PWM causes an additional losses associated with the PWM carrier frequency.

In this work, the computed losses are compared with experimental data for four induction motors made with different <b>silicon</b> <b>steels.</b> Iron losses are measured and compared with calculated iron losses when switching frequencies are varied...|$|R
50|$|In {{a typical}} power {{distribution}} grid, electric transformer power loss typically contributes about 40-50% {{of the total}} transmission and distribution loss. Energy efficient transformers are therefore an important means to reduce transmission and distribution loss. With the improvement of electrical steel (<b>silicon</b> <b>steel)</b> properties, the losses of a transformer in 2010 can be half that of a similar transformer in the 1970s. With new magnetic materials, {{it is possible to}} achieve even higher efficiency. The amorphous metal transformer is a modern example.|$|E
