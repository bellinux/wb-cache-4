Ulomci se sada nalaze u lokalnoj zbirci Stomorica a riječ je o ulomcima pluteja i sarkofaga. Ulomci pluteja ukrašeni su ranokršćanskim motivima squami i rombova a dosad nije bilo uočeno da pripadaju istoj oltarnoj ogradi. Na ulomku sarkofaga preostala je zanimljiva dekoracija koju čini traka s bršljanovom viticom i tragovima razdijeInog pilastra i kapitel. Dosad se smatralo da je taj ulomak također pripadao ranokršćanskom pluteju, ali pomnijom analizom utvrđeno je da je zapravo riječ o gornjem rubu sarkofaga arhitektonskog tipa kakvi su pronađeni u Aquileji i Novigradu a i inače bili su rašireni na području gornjeg Jadrana. Twenty {{years ago}} A. Šonje {{published}} several Early Christian reliefs in his paper on Late Antique {{art and architecture}} {{on the island of}} Pag. In this often cited paper, A. Šonje gathered all the information he was able to find in the scholarly literature as well as the results of his own archeological research. The Late Antique sites coincide with the settlements on {{the northern part of the}} island of Pag such as Novalja, Stara Novalja and Caska which occupies the location of the Roman Cissa. However, the Early Christian phase was discovered only in Novalja which boasts as much as three Early Christian churches — two cemeterial ones at Jaz and Gaj, and the large basilica within the walls that was most probably dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Among the scattered finds unearthed accidentally on the site of the long destructed basilica of St Mary in the 1950 s, A. Šonje mentions a couple of interesting Early Christian reliefs and believes that both of them belonged to two different fifth-century <b>screen</b> <b>slabs,</b> one of them even made of marble. The supposedly marble fragment is decorated with scales or squamae, as they were called, while the other fragment published by A. Šonje as the fragment of a different <b>screen</b> <b>slab,</b> is ornamented with a vegetaI motif with ivy leaves and a small pilaster strip carrying a leaved capital. After a more careful analysis undertaken in the local collection Stomorica, where these reliefs are kept today, it became clear that the marble fragment mentioned by A. Šonje is actually made of limestone. In addition, a very similar fragment housed in the collection, decorated with a lozenge pattern, seems to belong to the same altar screen, which has been unnoticed before. The fragment decorated with the ivy and the pilaster strip, on the other hand, surely did not belong to an Early Christian <b>screen</b> <b>slab</b> firstly because contemporary <b>screen</b> <b>slabs</b> never had such a decoration and secondly, because identical decoration has been attested elsewhere, on the Early Christian sarcophagi of the architectural type. The closest parallels can be found at Aquileia and Novigrad, where the same vegetal motif with ivy leaves and the same shallow pilaster strips with leaved capitals decorate the sides of the two sarcophagi already attributed to the same workshop. Although it was suggested by F. Ciliberto that the Aquileian sarcophagus might be of the fourth-century date, the fragments from Novalja and Novigrad probably belong to a later date, that of the 5 th century, due to the overall archeological contexts of these two places. Such an interpretation of these Early Christian reliefs, found on the site of the basilica of St Mary at Novalja, sheds a different light on the interior decoration of the basilica itself. Unlike A. Šonje had thought, the basilica did not have a marble altar screen but a limestone one decorated with squamae and lozenges, and it did not have two dissmilar screens at the same time, as he had believed, since the fragment with the vegetaI motif he had published as an altar screen fragment has proven to be a fragment of the architectural sarcophagus, the kind of which had been produced at Aquileia and popular throughout the northern Adriatic basin...|$|R

Early medieval sculpture on {{the island}} of Krk is rarely found in the scholarly literature. The reasons for this lie in the fact that no! only do we lack the archaeological context and contemporary architecture for these sculptures but thr early medieval period {{on the island}} as a whole is blurred and obscure due to the silence of the,written sources. The bishop of Krk was first mentioned only in 680, although the early Christian phase of the Krk cathedral speaks of the fifth-century date, when the bishopric might have been founded. An unnamed bishop attended the church synod in Split in the early 10 th century and the data become more available with the mm of the millenium Unfortunately, there are no preserved early medieval churches {{on the island of}} Krk but one and one can only suppose in which churches the early medieval fragments from Dobrinj, Omišalj, Krk, Punat and Košljun once originally stood. The fragments from Dobrinj are kept in the church of Holy Trinity and they were built in as spolia into the Romanesque church of St Nicholas in Soline, subsequently taken out and brought to Dobrinj. Whether they belonged to the earlier church that gave way to the Romanesque one is still open for debate. The early medieval fragments located in Omišalj are all concentrated in the Romanesque church of St Mary, built in as spolia on the exterior {{as well as in the}} pillars and pulpit in the interior, Their number and the fact that they were deliberately made visible in the church its fifteenth-and sixteenth-century remodellings allow us to suppose that there must have been an early medieval church that preceded the Romanesque basilica at Omišalj. This has been confirmed by the nineteenth-century transcription of the now eroded inscription on one of the fragments, noted down by M. Sabljar when it was still somewhat visible. The inscription mentions that a donor named Maurus had something done in the honor of the Lord and the blessed Virgin Mary, the dedication of the present-day church, and it has not been published before. The most interesting fragments are those built in above west door, especially the one that probably belonged to an ambo, decorated with a vegetal scroll and with drilled holes along the border, and the one with the cross-und er-arch motif next to it; as well as the fragment oft he <b>screen</b> <b>slab</b> re-used for the parapet of the pulpit, decorated with the so-called Korbboden motif The fragments from the town of Krk can be linked to the Krk cathedral and to the Benedictine church of St. Lawrence, formerly an early Christian cemetery basilica. Among the fragments from the cathedral, there is a group of three <b>screen</b> <b>slabs</b> which without a doubt belong to the same altar screen. They were decorated with the same cross-under-arch motif and the workmanship is identical on all three of them The fragments kept in the gallery Toš in Punat and those in the Franciscan monastery on the small island of Košljunj justI off the shore of Punat bay, were brought from the sites near Punat: the churches of St. George at Mala Krasa and St. Nicholas on cape Negrit. The fragments found in the church of St. George have been attributed to the early medieval altar screen installed in the early Christian church. The fragments taken out from the apse of St. Nicholas, on the other hand, did not necessarily belong to it but might have been easily brought from somewhere else. However, there are also fragments of uknown origin. The catalogued early medieval fragments from the island of Krk in this paper have been subjected lo the stylistic analysis, the only possible analysis due to lack of archaeological context, epigraphical material and the written sources. Such an analysis has shown that most fragments can be dated lo the 9 th century on the basis of the geometrical intcrlace pattern, typical of the Carolingian sculpture on the east Adriatic coast and in Italy as well. The choice of motifs and the quality of workmanship are uniform both in the north and south part the island. The preserved fragments of the <b>screen</b> <b>slabs</b> in Omišalj, Punat and Krk display the extensive use of the cross-under-arch motif which was also widespread in the ninth century sculpture on the east Adriatic coast but in Venice and Rome as well The analysis of the early medieval fragments from the island of Krk has proven that regardless of the many obstacles, the first step of making the fragments known to the scholar 1 y public should be made in order to make the future research easier. Instead of the written sources and the historical data, the sole witnesses who speak of the early medieval life through the sculpting activity are these reliefs. Translation: Magdalena Skobla...|$|R

Taj prošireni opus s posve novim kompozicijama i motivima omogućio je pridruživanje radionici i glasovitoga sućuračkog luka. Taj se korpus smješta u politički i crkveni kontekst širega jadranskog prostora i datira u doba nadbiskupa Ivana, predstavnika političke i crkvene elite karolinških vlastodržaca. KljučneDuring the {{research}} and conservation work in the Cathedral of Split in 1998 and 2001, two early medieval altar <b>screen</b> <b>slabs</b> cut in marble were discovered in the pavement of the choir (Figg. 1 - 2). Both slabs show a double motif of a cross under an arcade that is flanked by trees {{of life in the}} lower part and rosettes in the upper part. The slabs were immediately related to similar ones in Split and its surroundings. However, those links turned out to be only generic similarities of the compositional scheme. The analysis of details of specific elements regarding carving methods shows that both slabs have no analogies in Split and its closer surroundings. Therefore, even the smallest detail becomes important in the attempt to determine the origin of the slabs, i. e. the affiliation to a certain workshop. Particularly important in this regard is the detail of the cross–rosette with bloomed arms (Fig. 4 a-b). It is completely identical to one of the rosettes on a marble slab with cassettes (Fig. 3), which was assigned to the work of a local workshop from the late 8 th century based on the multiplication of the motif of crossed lilies. Crossed lilies are the basic motif on the reliefs from Split, entirely subordinated to the geometrical principle. The workshop’s characteristics are excellent sculptural work, marble – as the exclusive material used – and the ability to reinterpret the adopted motif. Apart from the slab with cassettes and the sarcophagus of Archbishop John (Fig. 10), a fragment of a sarcophagus or slab that was discovered as secondary material in the Late Baroque chapel of Saint Domnius (Fig. 5 b) as well as the slab that was incorporated as the side wall in the sarcophagus of the Good Shepherd in the Gothic chapel of Saint Domnius (Fig. 5 a) are also assigned to this workshop. Both afore–mentioned chapels form a part of the interior of the Split Cathedral. We propose to assign the altar <b>screen</b> <b>slabs</b> that were discovered in the choir of the Split Cathedral to the same workshop. A contribution to the opus of Split stonecarvers’ workshop from the late 8 th century Key words: Split stonecarvers’ workshop, 8 th century, sculpture, John of Ravenna The slab with cassettes represents the link between the part of the workshop’s production that is focused on repetitive motifs placed in the cassettes and the other part with iconographic origins in the motif of the “Gates of Heaven”. This is proven by specific details such as the identical cross–rosette, the use of identical groups of motifs (cross–rosette, multi–petal and whirlpool rosette), carving details like the hook, the diamond–shaped endings of the lilies and trees (Figg. 6 - 7). The sculptors of the Split workshop had therefore various patterns in their repertoire and were not limited to the repeating motif with crossed lilies or its combinations with rosettes of different types. After further comparative analysis, several other sculptures were also assigned to the workshop, so that there is a total of ten works by this workshop so far. These are, apart from the afore–mentioned ones, three fragments of pilasters belonging to an altar screen (Fig. 8 a-c), decorated with a tree of life emerging from a kantharos or a kantharos with interlaced pairs of pretzel motifs, as well as an altar screen arch that was found as a spolia in Kaštel Sućurac (Fig. 9). All these reliefs are connected to the Split Cathedral or its direct surrounding (the sarcophagus was intended for its affiliated Church of St. Matthew). Up to now, there are no recognizable stone sculptures by this workshop outside the immediate surroundings of Split. In discussing the chronology of the works of the Split workshop, we should in the first place emphasize that two of the motifs it uses have their origin in the North Adriatic region. These are the motif of crossed lilies and the motif of the hole surrounded by a carved circle (occhi di dado) that covers the crosses in the slabs with the representation of the “Gates of Heaven”. These decorative elements can be firmly dated to {{the last quarter of the}} 8 th c., and are related to the stylistic phenomenon of the late “Liutprand Renaissance” in Friuli (Fig. 12) and its reflections in Istria. Both afore– mentioned details are found on the ciborium of Bishop Mauritius from Novigrad in Istria (Fig. 14). It was affirmed before that this ciborium was commissioned from a workshop stationed in Cividale, unlike all the other sculpture of the Novigrad Cathedral, carved at the same time. A number of sculptures belonging to the cathedral are truly superb work and show a resemblance to contemporary sculptures in Rome (Figg. 15 - 16). It is quite possible that the Carolingian conquest of Istria involved the sending of sculptors to this region as well, hand in hand with political, military and ecclesiastical influence. That diplomatic interest for Istria is evident in the letter written by Pope Adrian to Charlemagne concerning the destiny of Bishop Mauritius, sent to Istria by the Pope himself, but molested and persecuted by the locals. On the other hand, the possible connections of the reliefs from Split with Rome are also supported by similarities with roman sculpture from that period, for ex. a <b>screen</b> <b>slab</b> fragmentarily preserved in the Roman basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin (Fig. 17). It can be linked to an early phase of its furnishing commissioned at the turn of the 9 th century. Since the same compositional scheme (“Gates of Heaven”) was used on altar <b>screen</b> <b>slabs</b> done by the Trogir stonecarvers’ workshop as early as the beginning of the 9 th century, it is quite possible that it was inspired by the slightly earlier but identical compositions of the Split workshop. Other compositions could bear witness to this process, too – the architraves of altar screen composed of a central epigraphic zone flanked by decorative zones, a mannerism which can be found in works of the Trogir workshop, as well as little earlier in Split. Within the scope of Pre–Romanesque sculpture on Italian soil, compositions such as these can be found – Grado and its surroundings aside – only in Rome, i. e. on reliefs that decorated the Church of St. Adrian, the Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian and the church dedicated to St. Martina, all on the Roman Forum. They were furnished with sculpture of the same characteristics all at the same time, respectively during the pontificate of Adrian I (772 – 795). By expanding the opus of the Split stonecarvers’ workshop we have noticed that its sculpture has quite certain roots in north–eastern Italy, possibly also in Rome. We have determined an almost identical situation in Istria as well. With regard to these facts, one should, of course, look for the protagonists of ecclesiastical and social elites who could have contributed to the realization of the works by this workshop. In search of the time and persons that would best fit the general historical context, the furnishings of the Cathedral of Saint Domnius with reliefs made by the Split stonecarvers’ workshop should be linked to the person of an Archbishop John, who attended the Council of Nicea in 787 and is since recently rightly identified with John of Ravenna, restorer of the Salonitan Church in the Diocletian’s palace. Historical circumstances indicate that this restorer of the Ecclesia Salonitana must be seen as an exponent of the Papal–Frankish Adriatic policy in the late 8 th century – which to a large extent was implemented via Ravenna. The political circumstances and aspirations of the last decades of the 8 th century therefore truly affected artistic creations. Sculptors that used crossed lilies and occhi di dado doubtlessly found their inspiration in north–eastern Italy, from where Carolingian political aspirations were spreading through Istria to Dalmatia. On the other hand, the use of motifs showing crosses under arcades flanked by trees of life points to papal Rome, from where the pontiff ’s aspirations to the Eastern Adriatic also derive...|$|R

Frane u Splitu otkriveno je nekoliko starokršćanskih spomenika: dva natpisa (danas izgubljena), sarkofag s prikazom motiva Prelaska Izraelaca preko Crvenoga mora, {{fragment}} s prikazom Krista i apostola te najvjerojatnije i motivom Davida i Golijata, pilastar s urezanim križem, fragment akroterija sarkofaga s križem te omanji fragment pluteja s ljiljanom. Današnja crkva sv. Frane uništila je prethodni samostan i crkvu, koje je u XI. st. podigao splitski nadbiskup Ivan IV. Čini se da je tu bilo i ranijih građevina iz starokršćanskog doba. Na temelju nalaza, osobito importiranih i lokalnih sarkofaga, može se pretpostaviti da se radi o važnom lokalitetu na kojem je izvorno mogao biti pokopan salonitanski mučenik Feliks. The Split archaedeacon Thomas from 13 th century {{states that}} the Split archbishop John the 4 th had built the church of St. Felix on {{the place of the}} present-day monastery of St. Francis (Sv. Frane). The archbishop John died in 1060 AD. St. Felix must have been a local saint who was mentioned in Chronicon Paschale (late 4 th century AD) as fellow sufferer of the Salonitan bishop and martyr Domnio (+ April 10 th 304). This is not Felix mentioned in Usuardo’s martyrologium as some Split scholars supposed, since this belonged to the city of Hispellum (present-day Spello) in Italy. Some old groundplans from the time preceding the reconstruction of the monastery seem to have certain elements of Early Christian architecture as evidenced by an octogonal structure {{to the north of the}} the church which might have been the baptistery or a mausoleum (fig. 1). There are a number of other monuments suggesting that St. Francis was built on an important Early Christian site. The paper lists all the fi nds beginning with the two lost inscriptions which were published in CIL III 2043 and 2107 (8589). The complete texts of these inscriptions might be red in the Croatian text. Both belonged to sarcophagi fragments. They do not contain any direct Christian formulation or symbol. The inscriptions are dating from the late 3 rd to the early 4 th century AD. The dead persons were metal workers in the factory of weapons in Salona which is testifi ed by Notitia Dignitatum (c. 8). The inscriptions contain also some other formulations. A remearkable Christian sarcophagus showing the Red Sea Crossing testifi es even more to the importance of this site (fig. 2). This marble sarcophagus is one of the fi nest and best preserved with this theme. On the right side two young apostles glorifying the Christ monogramme surrounded by a wreath on the plastically rendered cross were shown (fig. 4). Only the squamae decoration is executed on the left side (fig. 3) while on the back young apsotles in the corners (fi gs 6, 7) and a female orans (with her arms stretched and velatio capitis) in the centre (fig. 5). The latter represents either the institution of the Church or Virgin Mary. The sarcophagus was made around 390 AD. It was the import either from Rome or from southern Gaul. Another fragment of a sarcophagus produced in Rome or in Gaul showing three persons is walled into the southern wall of the cloister (fig. 8). The fi rst fi gure to the left is a soldier in the armour and with a shield. The two persons to the right must have been apostles with scrolls in their hands. Such a combination of a soldier and apostles is not familiar on such sarcophagi. However, the scene to the left depicts very probably the duel between Goliath (the soldier) and David who must have been shown with the catapult to the left (there are some slight remains of a fi gure). It is quite sure that to the right was the scene of apostles and the Christ, but it is not known the number of apostles. Their number must have been reduced (probably only three on each side of Christ).). This fragment very likely belonged to the sarcophagus body, since scenes of the Christ with apostles did not appear on the lid. The sarcophagus was probably a small one (child’s dimensions). The fragment is dating also from the end of the 4 th century. A small pilaster (a part of a window) with large cross inscribed on its front side was walled into the western part of the southern church wall (fig. 9). Letter N and fi ve arm star were cut at the top later. Also a circle with the cross and letter A were cut at the bottom. The meaning and the time of execution of these letters and signs are not known. A sarcophagus acroterion of a sarcophagus with deeply cut cross is walled up into the side door of the church of St. Francis (fig. 10). This acroterion is very similar to Salonitan ones. On the opposite side of the same door a fragment of altar or ambo <b>screen</b> <b>slab</b> was also walled up (fig. 11). This fragment contains a lily blossom in the left corner of the bottom. Altogether seven ancient or Early Christian monuments have been found in S. Francis’s church. Ancient graves were found in the vicinity. Fragment of a burial relief is walled up in Ban Mladenova street. A stele containing an ancient epitaph is built in the Plinarska street, while Early Christian fragments were found in St. Mikula (St. Nicolas) church which is also near. All these fi nds testify to the existence of an important archaeological site around the St. Francis’s Church. Therefore the possibility that martyr Felix might have been buried there is very probable...|$|R

A {{group of}} 11 th century reliejs shows {{the first major}} {{concentration}} of images of the Virgin, primarily {{in the context of}} themes from the cycle ofCh rist 2 ̆ 7 s life. These are representations of Maiestas Virginis (Sedes Sapientiae), the Madonna orans, and subsequently individual scenes from the Christological cycle, such as the more interesting Annunciation and the Adoration of the Magi, as well as the Visitation, the Birth, and so forth. Even though only the first mentioned are tntiy independent representations of the Virgin Mary, the images are viewed here as a whole, as their significance in fact arisesfrom their mutual context and the message they bear in the framework ofthe reformed Jith centUJy. The first among s lch creations were the altar <b>screen</b> <b>slabs</b> in the Church ofSt Dominique in Zadar. The first (Fig. J) contains the following within nine arcades: the Annunciation (two arcades), the Visitation, the Birth with the Adoration of the Shepherds (three arcades), and the Adoration of the Magi (three arcades). The second slab (Fig. 2) contains the Slaughter of the Innocent Children (four arcades), the Flight to Egypt (three arcades), and the Baptism (two arcades, only one of which is preserved with the figure of the St John the Baptist, as the last, ninth field is missing). Following in terms of concentration, but also chronologically, is the sculpture from the Church ofSt Lawrence in Zadar, where the image ofthe Virgin appears several times. In the scene of the Annunciation on the portal it is almost hidden (Fig. 3) in the tendrils ofthe tree oflife. One of the reconstructed altar <b>screen</b> <b>slabs</b> (Fig. 4) shows the Annunciation, the Visitation, and the Birth in three square fields. The second row is damaged, but it is possible to recognize the visitation ofthe Wise Men to Herod in the centralfield {{on the basis of the}} remains of a throne and the figure of a soldier in armor) and to the right the visit of the. Vlagi. The totality of the figural representations in the Church ofSt Lawrence is enriched by the praying figure with an aureole caroed on une ofthe four capitals (Fig. 5). Entirely different, and even unique among Croatian sC 2 ̆ 7 ulpture of the Jith century, are the images of the Virgin Jlmy at Crkvina in Biskupija near Knin. She is shown on two occasions as an isolated figure, as the Madonna orans (Fig. 6) in the altar screen gable, and as Maiestas Virginis in the transenna at one ofthe most outstanding places within the sanctuary (Fig. 8 J. It is indisputable that the images of the Virgin in the described instances greatly differfrom one another. While aprogrammed emphasis of the Virgin, and certainly her triumph, can be perceived at Crkvina in Biskupija near Knin, the representations in Zadar remain dependent on the standard images from the Christological cycle. It is apparent in the choice of themes that the Virgin had a special position, no matter how this fit into the cycle of the Life of Christ. In the search for the reasons for this suddenly emphasized worship of the Virgin, the first and most solid indicators are given by the latest of the representations under discussion, those from the altar screen of the Cburch of Our Lady at Crkvina in Biskupija near Knin. The main focus was on the altar screen itself, emphasized not merely with the dominant figure ofthe Virgin on the central gable, but also by the inscriptions accompanying the carved images on the architrave and Rable. Although they are fragmentmy, contents from the Marian hymn cycle in rhythmic form can be recognized. The inscription on the central gable is important in this sense: SALVE/RF/G/INA S/ALVE V!IR/GO, with separated syllables that suggest a direct copying from a musical composition. This relates the inscription to the Marian antiphonies from the repertary of Gregorian chams ofthe 11 th/ 12 th centuries, such as Ave regina coelorum and Salve Regina. The total arrangement ofelements in the church also indi. cates the speCial importance given to the Virgin :vIary. The Virgin is an entirely independent supplicant who blesses those who turn to her, but she is also definitely a queen, as the inscription below her explicitly states. This strict tie between the inscription field and the figure exactly determines two key moments virgo and regina, which literally fits into the iconographic change in the significanee of the Virgin in the 11 th centwy. Only at this point does she become the queen of the church in and of herself, a glimpse ofwhich can be caught in the developmental route and on the slabs ofSt Dominique in Zadar. In the Church ofOur Lady in Crkvina the written text merely explains what the entire a 11 istic arrangement exhibits. The Virgo orans is exactly in the center ofthe altar screen composition, most probably in direct visual connection with the second representation -. 1 aiestas Virginis (Sedes Sapientiae), which must have been part of the altar. The Virgin in this case had taken the place of Christ, which is something that had not been noted before. The crucified Christ (Fig. 9) was probably placed at the top of the gable of the altar screen, dominating the area for the faithful. The chancel eVidently belonged to the Virgin Mary, with the main altar dedicated to her. There are several elements in the Church ofSt Dominique in Zadar that literally emphasize the Virgin Mary in scenes from Christ 2 ̆ 7 s childhood. The Virgin appears five times in the total of seven scenes shown on both slabs. Although these appearances necessari 0 Jresult from this segment of the Christological cycle, their choice was nonetheless deliberate, and the emphasize on the Virgin lVIary was desired. However, some of the scenes were packed into on(y one arcade, while others were drawn out into several. The background remains fairly empty in individual spaces, while elsewhere the figures are lilerally overlapping. A reason must existfor this stylistic and rythmicallack oflogic. On both slabs (composed of nine arcades) the Virgin assumes the central position, once in the scene ofthe Bil 1 h, and on the other on horseback in the Flight to Egypt. It should be noted that she could not successfully have been placed in the centra! field of the second slab (the Flight to Egypt) were the Slaughter of the Innocents not stretched out with a complete lack of logic over four fields. The scene of the Birth occupies the fourth and fifth arcades of the first slab. In order to "push" the Virgin into the fifth and central field, the sculptor clumsily succeeded in placing her head, over proportioned in relation to the other figures, in the center ofthe composition. It shouldfurther be emphasized that the sculptor had free choice within the given bounds. This is shown by another two elements. In the scene ofthe Adoration of the, 2 ̆ 7 I;[agi, the Virgin on the throne was placed separately under one arcade, while the three wise men were separated in another two. It could certainly be said that here the necessary arrangement of the figures under the arcades reflected their logical position and order, which is correct in principle. However, it is also a fact that the scene of the Slaugbter of the innocent children takes up a full four arcades, while other scenes are compressed under a single arch. Thus it can be concluded that the position ofthe Virgin Mary on the throne under one arcade was a desired element, she appearing in this separated manner as Maiestas. That the emphasis was truly placed on the Virgin Mary is confirmed by a small detail of the Annunciation. Only tbe first two arcades of all tbose on botb slabs bear spirally twisted columns, with more empbasized relief than the others, and these are the only anes with capitals. It can be said that the master sculptor wished to emphasize the architecturalform in wbich the Virgin was located -a temple. But why was this not carried out in another, equally valid case, such as the Adoration of the Magi, where it should also have been present? It is exactly this detail thatproves the actual and contemplated desire to separate the Virgin Mary from the totality ofthe Gbristological cycle. This certainly is not some speCial element ofZadar representation in the 11 th century. The process has already heen noted elsewhere, mainly on the miniatures ofthe Ottonian period, where tbe Virgin Mary gradually became hoth independent and dominant on her throne in the scene ofthe Adoration of the Magi. All elements at the Church ofSt Lawrence in Zadar indicate a somewhat disguised but nonetheless evident greater importance ofthe cult of the Virgin Mary. Beginning from the portal, where on the doorjamb an artistically completely clumsy scene of the Annunciation appears in floral tendrils, which draws attention to the importance given to the cult, to the interior, where on one of the preserved slabs, the figure of the Virgin appears in the usual Christological cycle. The importance ofthe cult of Our Lady is emphasized here by a small praying figure with an aureole carved on one of the capitals of the church, entirely unexpected among the other capitals. It is apparent in the examples presented here that the representations ofthe Virgin Mary have equal importance as those of Christ. This is evident at Crkvina in what is almost an exaltation of the Virgin Mary. The importance attributed to Our Lady can also be seen in the Zadar representations in the manner of compOSing the scenes frum the Christological cycle,from the position intended for her in tbe representation to the emphasis of detail which highlights bel 2 ̆ 7 and places her in the center ofthe cult. The Virgin Mary certainly found a privileged position with the Gregorian reforms. The titles used to refer to her (Our Lady, Mother of God, etc.) speak of her importance, and especially of changes in relation to the earlier periods. This entire group ofimages ofthe Virgin Mary is reminiscent of the situation, although it is somewhat later chronologically, in the territory ruled by Matilda ofCanossa, which is intensively tied to the nucleus of the Gregorian reforms. An emphasis is given in many churches on the liturgical furnishings to the iconography ofthe Incarnation ofChrist through J 1 ary. In such cases, the Virgin Mary is very often in the center of the altar screen, and related to other scenes from the Chn 2 ̆ 7 stological cycle, such as the Annunciation, the Visitation, etc. This is yet more imp 011 ant as the entire Croatian Kingdom was added very early on to the circle of lands where the reform took hold, inheriting as early as the first halj of the 11 th century the already begun reforms ofthe Benedictine Camaidolese branch. In this sense, the described sculptural accomplishments are considered as a unitfiting into the clear political attitude ofthe reformed church in which the Virgin Mary was the ideal of reform, symbolizing, among other things, the resistance to lay law over the church. It should be mentioned in conclusion that the Church of Our Lady in Knin with its new liturgical furnishings was rededicated in the presence of the only recently enthroned King Zvonimir, who had received the insignia of royal power directly from the pope, as his vassal. Pat 1 icularly in this act it is possible to see the culmination ofthis imp 011 ance for propaganda ofthe described 11 th centU 1]! representations ofthe Virgin Mary...|$|R

Nedavno su pronađeni dobro sačuvani elementi liturgijskog namještaja crkvene građevine. Autorica analizom skulpture ukrašene geometriziranom kršćanskom simbolikom prepoznaje utjecaje različitih klesarskih radionica svojstvenih sredini 6. st. The islet of Osinj at {{the head}} of the {{so-called}} Little Neretva which parts from the main Neretva river near Opuzen. The late Medieval church of St. John was built in a bay with a small harbour in the western, lower, section of the island. A path leads to Gradina hill (76 m) which rises above the eastern side of the island and dominates the surrounding area. This was the site of a late antique fort with an early Christian church. Conservation work on St. John 2 ̆ 7 s in 1980 revealed pieces of the early Christian interior furnishings built into the walls of the late Medieval church. Fragments of the s labs and pilasters of the chancel screen, of shafts and bases columns, and of stone vessels were also uncovered. When the Gradina terrain was cleared in 1985 a section of the stone base of the chance l <b>screen</b> was discovered <b>slabs</b> and pilasters lying near it. Preserved square mortices for the placement of the pilasters and the longitudinal grooves for the slabs show the exact distribution of the elements of the chancel screen and the entrance to the presbytery. The remains of the s labs found in both churches were sufficient to renstruct several sections of the chancel screen. The chancel screen was obviously composed of two pairs of slabs with the same symbolic representations of Christ. The front side had slightly wider stone slabs showing monograms of Christ and the cross, while lateral slabs had only crosses inscribed in rhombuses and circles with double bands. The early Christian sculpture of the presbytery is characteristic of its time, as strictly geometrical representation of Christian symbolism was typical of the middle of the 6 th century. The chancel screen in early Christ an church in Osinj was produced in local workshops. The sculpture di splays the influence of two cultural circles: the slabs show the characteristic motifs of the Brač workshops influenced by the mass production work of the Salona region, which supplied many of the early Christian edifices throughout the length of the Adriatic. The influence of Narona left traces in the decoration of the pilaster found in Osinj. It is not uncommon to find a multiplicity of stylistic influences {{at the head}} of the Neretva delta, on the top of the island of Osinj, whence access to the river and to sea going routes could be controlled. This divergence of styles is clearly reflected in the design of the sculpture found in this early Christian church, which was constructed within a Byzantine fort at the time of Justinian 2 ̆ 7 s reconquest...|$|R

Objavljuje se niz starijih kamenih i mramornih ulomaka, pronađenih tijekom sanacije. Od njih su najznačajniji dijel ovi crkvenog namještaja kojima se upotpunjuju saznanja o srednjovjekovnim transformacijama katedrale. Uređenjem unutrašnjosti kora ponovo su došle do punog izražaja vrijednosti te značajne umjetničke cjeline. Pri tome su vraćene korske klupe u položaj koji su imale u 17. stoljeću i tako ponovo usklađene s baroknom arhitekturom koja im je bila prilagođena. The {{main reason}} for the {{construction}} of the choir of Split Cathedral was the lack of room in the ancient building, which had over the course of years become increasingly cramped. The apostolic visitor of 1579 Agostino Valier found that laymen and canons sat squeezed cheek by jowl on the choir stalls in the narrow space before the main altar, and ordered that the church be enlarged. When in 1615 Archbishop Marco Antonio de Dominis finally built a new choir and placed the old stalls in it, he at the same time realised the ancient wish for the expansion of the cathedral and completed the long process of opening up the presbytery, that is, bringing the Eucharistic sacrament closer to the commons in the nave. De Dominis managed with very modest resources to build a new choir, although {{at the beginning of the}} 17 th century the economic state of affairs in the town and in the archdiocese was crippling, the plague epidemic of 1608 having almost wiped out the population. This is a situation that certainly has to be borne in mind when assessing the value of this Baroque building. So far it has usually been repeated that it is modest, unprepossessing, even ugly, and the whole operation described as inconsiderate damage to and uglification of valuable ancient architecture. Here we shall attempt to show that the Baroque choir of Split Cathedral is not only significant in an architectural and artistic sense, but that the builders, in the given circumstances, certainly paid a great deal of attention to the values they found already present. Archbishop Markantun de Dominis had to fit into the new building of his choir the wooden backs of the choir stalls, in the form in which in the 15 th century they had already been set up in the presbytery. The architecture of the Baroque choir was thus adjusted to the old choir stalls, and the lower part of the walls is completely plain and unrelieved, the level of the first stone cornice being determined by the height of the stalls. On the same wooden dais between the two wings of the stalls, in the centre of the eastern wall, very likely during the time of Archbishop Sforza Ponzoni, a wooden throne was set up, the work of a Venetian workshop. The central zone of the walls of the choir is relieved with stone pilasters featuring Ionian capitals, between which flat fields were left for the accommodation of large paintings with scenes from the life and martyrdom of St Domnius [Dujam] painted in 1683 - 1685 by Pietro Ferrari according to a commission by the then archbishop, Stefano Cosmi. In the western bays of the side walls there were balconies supported on stone corbels, as documented in the drawings of V. Andric (1582) and E. Hebrard (1912). The floors of the balconies made of great stone slabs were placed on these corbels, slabs which had been obtained by sawing the architraves in part of the peristyle of Diocletian 2 ̆ 7 s Mausoleum, from which the colonnade had been removed when the choir was built on. On a southern balcony the choir sang on very solemn occasions, and on the northern balcony an organ might have been placed. In the upper part of the choir 2 ̆ 7 s walls were nine oval windows bordered with stone frames that had been carved out of the slabs of the stone coffered ceiling of the peristyle, which is shown from the remains of the shallow moulding visible on 303 the external sides of the windows. The Baroque wooden gilt chandelier is extant, and above it, on a chain, a wooden relief of the dove of the Holy Spirit is affixed to the ceiling. The interior of the choir is as a whole fairly modest, with a simple volume, and relieved with a restrained classical architectural vocabulary. However, while judging the artistic value of the architecture, we nevertheless have to bear in mind the very difficult conditions in which it was created, which meant that it was built entirely of material to hand (stone from parts of the Mausoleum and the houses knocked down where the choir was built). The builder of the choir, within the slender opportunities available to him, coped very well, and thus we can point to the confidently proportioned volume of the whole and individual walls, based on the square and the golden section rectangle. The choir is adeptly fitted into the tissue of the buildings that already stood. Since it was surrounded on all sides with houses, it was raised far enough above them for the oval windows to be opened up in the upper zone of the walls, thus obtaining the necessary daylight. In this manner a large wall surface was left untouched for the placing of paintings, and the typical Baroque lighting from above was obtained. On the northern fa 9 ade, a drawing incised in the plaster is retained, the ground for a painting from the 17 th century that shows a trompe l 2 ̆ 7 oeil architectural composition. After the fire of the old archbishop 2 ̆ 7 s palace in 1924 and its demolition, a view was opened up onto the choir that was not originally provided for and led substantially to its aesthetic downgrading. Archbishops and canons were buried in the choir. The central tomb, facing the archiepiscopal throne, was commissioned by Sforza Ponzoni, the same archbishop that completed the arrangement of the choir. In research at the end of 1998 a coffin was found with a complete skeleton and below it the commingled bones of at least five more archbishops. After that, in archaeological probes of the pavement of the choir, a part of the front side of an antique stone sarcophagus was discovered, with an inscription and a depiction of a dolphin, a fragment of a limestone beam decorated with interwoven arcades of two stranded bands and three marble items of medieval church furnishings- two slabs and one beam of the choir <b>screen.</b> The <b>slabs</b> have characteristic ornamentation of two crosses, each under an arch, flanked with palmettes and rosettes. Because of the absence of any interlacing decoration they can be dated early, to the 81 h and 91 h centuries. The beam has a carved inscription mentioning St John the Baptist, and it can be assumed that it came into the choir from the nearby baptistery. Stone fragments have been found in the walls: a large Corinthian capital from one of the ancient columns of the peristyle, parts of the door and window frames from houses or ruins that stood where the choir now is, and two fragments of stone pre-Romanesque ecclesiastical furnishing- a small roughly worked stylised Corinthian capital of a pilaster and part of the ciborium of an altar with a relief of stylised birds. North east of the choir, on the site of the demolished archbishop 2 ̆ 7 s palace complex, a Roman mosaic has been discovered; in 1968 - 1972 archaeological revision work was carried out. After this the foundations of the choir were not conserved and subsequently gave way because water penetrated behind them, forcing the banked material outwards. This seriously compromised the structural stability of the choir, which was anyway constructed of relatively poor material. The walls 304 of the choir are founded partly on the firm footing of the massive base of the peristyle of the mausoleum, and partially on a substrate of heterogeneous material. All this led to the subsidence of the foundations and the cracking of the walls. In conservation works started in 1999, the foundations of the choir were injected, and then through the dozen metres long horizontal boreholes below the choir, steel rods were inserted to pull the foundation walls together. The walls were grouted with a lime-based mixture, and the most damaged portions were rebuilt. Tie rods were placed at three levels. The dilapidated roof construction was replaced with a new one, and the floor of the attic was made with three layers of boards, providing a brace against earthquakes. The remains of the one-time fresco on the northern wall was made good by mortar filleting and grouting, and the remains of the drawing incised into the plaster, previously hardly visible, were picked out with lime mortar, and now can be seen from a distance. The Baroque gilt wooden chandelier was restored. The restored wooden archiepiscopal throne was put back in the choir, as well as two of the six large paintings by Ferrari. The Gothic crucifix was put back above the throne and thus the composition of the eastern wall of the choir was rounded off. In the western bays of the longitudinal walls, which were empty after the suspended balcony of a recent date had been removed; six Ponzoni 2 ̆ 7 s paintings have been hung. The choir stalls were restored to their 17 th century form. The fragments of medieval church furnishing found during the conservation works were placed on the free part of the northern wall of the choir. Here a kind of little stone collection has been created, bearing witness to the complex history of the cathedral and the many vicissitudes experienced by its interior...|$|R
