5|$|For {{unlicensed}} mariners, 2009 {{statistics from}} the American Bureau of Labor Statistics give median earnings for able and ordinary <b>seamen</b> as US$35,810, varying from $21,640 (at the 10th percentile) to $55,360 (at the 90th percentile). This can be compared with 2006 {{statistics from the}} International Labour Organization, giving average yearly earnings for Filipino and Chinese able <b>seamen</b> around $2,000 to $3,000 per year (PHP9,900 per month and CNY3,071 per year). Among licensed mariners, American chief engineers earned a median $63,630, varying from $35,030 to $109,310 while their Filipino counterparts averaged $5,500 per year (PHP21,342 per month).|$|E
5|$|In 1892, Battenberg {{invented the}} Battenberg Course Indicator, a {{relative}} velocity analogue computer device used by <b>seamen</b> to determine course and speed to steer for changes of position between ships.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Fryatt's {{body was}} exhumed and {{returned}} to the United Kingdom for burial. His coffin was landed at Dover, and transported in South Eastern and Chatham Railway PMV No.132 to London. On 8 July 1919, his funeral was held at St Paul's Cathedral. Hundreds of merchant <b>seamen</b> and widows of merchant <b>seamen</b> and fishermen attended. Representing the Government were many members of the Admiralty, the Board of Trade, the Cabinet and the War Office.|$|E

5|$|A {{circumstance}} {{occurred during}} the action which so strongly marks the invincible spirit of British <b>seamen,</b> when engaging the enemies of their country, that I cannot resist the pleasure I have in making it known to their Lordships; the Temeraire was boarded by accident; or design, by a French ship on one side, and a Spaniard on the other; the contest was vigorous, but, {{in the end the}} combined ensigns were torn from the poop and the British hoisted in their places. Collingwood's account, probably based largely on Harvey's report {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the battle, contained several errors. Temeraire had closely engaged two French ships, rather than a French and a Spanish ship, and had not been boarded by either during the action. Nevertheless, the account was popular and a print was rushed out purporting to show Harvey taking the lead in clearing Temeraires decks of enemy <b>seamen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Continuing eastwards, Whitechapel tube {{station is}} {{on the north side}} of the road, {{alongside}} the street market. Behind the tube station is the former site of Blackwall Buildings a set of philanthropic houses built in 1890. Just to the east of the market are almshouses at Trinity House, that were originally built in 1695 for retired <b>seamen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Irish {{merchant}} shipping {{saw to it}} that vital imports continued to arrive and exports, mainly food supplies to Great Britain, were delivered. Irish ships sailed unarmed and usually alone, identifying themselves as neutrals with bright lights and by painting the Irish tricolour and EIRE in large letters on their sides and decks. Nonetheless twenty percent of <b>seamen</b> serving in Irish ships perished, victims of a war not their own: attacked by both sides, though predominantly by the Axis powers. Often, Allied convoys could not stop to pick up survivors, while Irish ships always answered SOS signals and stopped to rescue survivors, irrespective of which side they belonged to. Irish ships rescued 534 <b>seamen.</b>|$|E

5|$|R v Baillie, {{also known}} as the Greenwich Hospital Case, was a 1778 {{prosecution}} of Thomas Baillie for criminal libel. The case initiated the legal career of Thomas Erskine. Baillie, the Lieutenant-Governor of the Greenwich Hospital for <b>Seamen,</b> a facility for injured or pensioned off <b>seamen,</b> had noted irregularities and corruption in the hospital, which was formally run by the Earl of Sandwich. After his official reporting of the problems failed to bring about reform in the hospital, Baillie published a pamphlet that was critical of the hospital's officers, alleging that Sandwich had given appointments to pay off political debts; Sandwich ignored the pamphlet but ensured that Baillie was indicted for criminal libel. Baillie hired five barristers, including Erskine, then newly called to the Bar, and appeared before Lord Mansfield in the Court of King's Bench on 23 November 1778.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty also {{provided}} a largely naval , including the Antarctic veterans Edgar Evans, Tom Crean and William Lashly. Other <b>seamen</b> in the shore party included Patrick Keohane and Robert Forde, Thomas Clissold (cook) and Frederick Hooper (domestic steward). Two Russians, Dimitri Gerov (dog driver) and Anton Omelchenko (groom), also landed.|$|E

5|$|The ship's company, under Captain Bernard Jensen, {{consisted}} of 19Norwegian <b>seamen</b> and one Swedish steward. Jensen was an experienced ice navigator in Arctic and Antarctic waters, {{and had been}} with Borchgrevink on Bull's Antarctic voyage in 1894–95.|$|E
5|$|Warren's squadron, which {{included}} Gibraltar, supplied nearly 700 <b>seamen</b> and marines {{for an attack}} on the French batteries investing the town. The action took place on 14September but was only partially successful, and eight days later the British ships left Elba. Porto Ferrajo itself remained in British hands {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{was sworn}} into office as the nation's second {{president}} on March 4, 1797, by Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth. As president, he followed Washington's lead {{in using the}} presidency to exemplify republican values and civic virtue; and his service was free of scandal. He continued to strengthen the central government by expanding the Navy and Army. In July 1798 Adams signed into law the Act for the Relief of Sick and Disabled <b>Seamen,</b> which authorized {{the establishment of a}} government-operated marine hospital service.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by {{the actions}} of the Temeraires crew, Campbell met with Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell the {{following}} day and informed him of the mutineers' demands. Mitchell reported the news to the Admiralty while Campbell returned to Temeraire and summoned the crew on deck once more. He urged them to return to duty, and then dismissed them. Meanwhile, discipline had begun to break down among the mutineers. Several of the crew became drunk, and some of the officers were struck by rowdy <b>seamen.</b> When one of the marines who supported the mutiny was placed in irons for drunken behaviour and insolence, a crowd formed on deck and tried to free him. The officers resisted these attempts and as sailors began to push and threaten them, Campbell gave the order for the marines to arrest those he identified as the ringleaders. The marines hesitated, but then obeyed the order, driving the unruly <b>seamen</b> back and arresting a number of them, who were immediately placed in irons. Campbell ordered the remaining crew to abandon any mutinous actions, and deprived of its leaders, the mutiny collapsed, though the officers were on their guard for several days afterwards and the marines were ordered to carry out continuous patrols.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a nominal roll or other records listing the Australians {{who took part in the}} D-Day landings, it is not {{possible}} to determine the exact number involved. However, it has been estimated that about 3,000 Australian military personnel and merchant <b>seamen</b> participated in the operation. The total number of Australians killed on 6 June was 14, of whom 12 were RAAF airmen and two were members of the RAN.|$|E
5|$|From late 1914, Philomel, needing {{maintenance}} and an update of equipment, was berthed at Malta and underwent an overhaul. This {{was completed by}} late January 1915 and she then started operations in the Mediterranean against the Turks. On 8 February she landed an armed party in Southern Turkey where a large force of Turkish soldiers were encountered, resulting in three <b>seamen</b> being killed and three wounded. This action marked the first deaths {{in the war of}} New Zealanders serving with a New Zealand formation.|$|E
5|$|In the lead-up to the Japanese {{invasion}} of Java {{a force of}} 242carrier and land-based aircraft attacked Darwin on 19 February 1942. At the time Darwin was an important base for Allied warships and a staging point for shipping supplies and reinforcements into the NEI. The Japanese attack was successful, and resulted {{in the deaths of}} 235 military personnel and civilians, many of whom were non-Australian Allied <b>seamen,</b> and heavy damage to RAAF Base Darwin and the town's port facilities.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1871, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant had named Hall as overall {{commander}} of the expedition, and he was being referred to as Captain. Though Hall had abundant Arctic experience, he had no sailing experience, and so the title was purely honorary. In selecting the officers and <b>seamen,</b> Hall relied heavily on whalers with experience in the Arctic. This was markedly different from the polar expeditions of the British Admiralty, which tended to use naval officers and highly disciplined crews.|$|E
5|$|Jervis had the {{reputation}} as a disciplinarian and {{put in place a}} new system that would ensure that the men in the Mediterranean fleet did not mutiny. To begin with the admiral wrote a new set of standing orders. For example, Jervis divided the <b>seamen</b> and marines and berthed the two separately putting the marines between the officers aft and the men forward. Thus he created an effective barrier between officers and potentially unruly crews.|$|E
5|$|Mary endowed the College of William and Mary (in {{the present}} day Williamsburg, Virginia) in 1693, {{supported}} Thomas Bray, who founded the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, and {{was instrumental in the}} foundation of the Royal Hospital for <b>Seamen,</b> Greenwich, after the Anglo-Dutch victory at the Battle of La Hogue. She is credited with influencing garden design at Het Loo and Hampton Court Palaces, and with popularising blue and white porcelain and the keeping of goldfish as pets.|$|E
5|$|No {{detailed}} {{records of}} his naval service between 1891 and 1901 {{appear to have}} survived. The last-named year saw him serving on HMS Gibraltar in Cape Town where, in September, Scott's expedition ship Discovery stopped {{on the way to}} the Antarctic. Scott was short-handed, and requested volunteers; from a response of several hundreds, Joyce was one of four <b>seamen</b> chosen to join Discovery. He sailed south with her on 14 October 1901.|$|E
5|$|Shirayuki {{handed over}} the rescued <b>seamen</b> to troops on Endau the {{following}} day. They were never seen again, but {{are believed to have}} been executed in retaliation for losses sustained by the Japanese in an ambush by the Australian 2/18th Battalion, which occurred south of Mersing {{about the same time as}} the naval action off Endau. Davies, four other officers, and 61 ratings from Thanet managed to reach shore and made their way to Singapore, together with shot down aircrew.|$|E
5|$|The ILO {{successfully}} {{restricted the}} addition of lead to paint, and convinced several countries to adopt an eight-hour work day and forty-eight-hour working week. It also campaigned to end child labour, increase {{the rights of women}} in the workplace, and make shipowners liable for accidents involving <b>seamen.</b> After the demise of the League, the ILO became an agency of the United Nations in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The Navy asked Congress to {{give each}} victim's family $5,000. Representative John E. Rankin (D-MS) insisted the amount be reduced to $2,000 when he learned most of the dead were black men. Congress settled on $3,000 in compensation. Years later, on March 4, 1949, the heirs of {{eighteen}} merchant <b>seamen</b> killed in the explosion were granted a total of $390,000 after gaining approval of their consent decrees in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} for auxiliary ranks and pay is scant: even less exists than the patchy {{evidence for}} their legionary counterparts. There {{seems to be}} some consensus, however, that the auxiliary was paid one third of what a legionary received: 300 sesterces a year (400 after the reign of the emperor Commodus). Both auxiliaries and <b>seamen</b> received the viaticum of 300 sesterces, although the various sources differ as to whether auxiliaries and sailors received the retirement bonus known as the honesta missio, or honorable discharge.|$|E
5|$|The {{rest of the}} {{officers}} and scientific staff were Americans (first mate Hubbard Chester, second mate William Morton, and astronomer and chaplain R.W.D. Bryan) and Germans (chief scientist and surgeon Emil Bessels and meteorologist Frederick Meyer). The <b>seamen</b> were mostly German, as was chief engineer Emil Schumann. In addition to the 25officers, crew, and scientific staff, Hall brought Inuit interpreter and hunter Ebierbing, his wife Tookoolito, and their child. A Greenlandic aboriginal named Hans Hendrik, his wife Merkut and three children also joined the expedition.|$|E
5|$|While {{there are}} differing {{accounts}} of the casualties on board the two troopships, the official figures state that 89 people were killed on board Duchess of York and 26 on board California. The survivors were rescued by the two destroyers and Moyola, including 660 by Iroquois alone. They were subsequently taken to Casablanca in North Africa by the warships, from where the <b>seamen</b> returned to Britain and military personnel continued to West Africa on board the troopship SS Nea Hellas.|$|E
5|$|With the French threat by sea eliminated, the Royal Navy {{was free}} {{to go on the}} offensive, and command of the Porto Ferrajo {{garrison}} was placed in the hands of Lieutenant Colonel George Airey while Warren had returned with his powerful squadron. Plans were then drawn up for a force of <b>seamen,</b> Royal Marines and Tuscan auxiliaries to launch an amphibious operation against the French batteries that overlooked the mouth of the harbour. The British assembled a landing party of 449 Marines and 240 <b>seamen</b> from Renown, HMS Gibraltar, HMS Dragon, HMS Alexander, HMS Genereux, HMS Stately, Pomone, Pearl and the brig HMS Vincejo, all under the command of Captain George Long of Vincejo and Captain John Chambers White of Renown. Approximately 1,000 Tuscan troops joined them. Landings took place on the morning of 14 September. The troops then moved inland against the batteries in two columns while Dragon and Genereux bombarded a fortified tower at Marciana.|$|E
5|$|Working {{alongside}} Gemma whilst {{they were}} producing the globes, Mercator would {{have witnessed the}} process of progressing geography: obtaining previous maps, comparing and collating their content, studying geographical texts and seeking new information from correspondents, merchants, pilgrims, travellers and <b>seamen.</b> He put his newly learned talents {{to work in a}} burst of productivity. In 1537, aged only 25, he established his reputation with a map of the Holy Land which was researched, engraved, printed and partly published by himself.|$|E
5|$|After Shirley had {{returned}} home that afternoon, the mob, which had seized another naval officer and several petty officers, {{returned to his}} house. Shirley ordered a number of armed men who were protecting his house to fire at the mob, but William Pepperrell was able to stop Shirley's men from firing and to persuade the mob to leave. In the meantime, Commodore Knowles threatened to bombard Boston with his squadron. It was only after the Massachusetts Council adopted resolutions {{in support of the}} demands of the mob that the situation became quieter in Boston. The mob eventually released its hostages and Knowles released the impressed <b>seamen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Scottish <b>seamen</b> {{received}} {{protection against}} arbitrary impressment onto English men-of-war under Charles II, a fixed quota of conscripts for the Royal Navy was levied from the sea-coast burghs {{during the second}} half of the seventeenth century. Royal Navy patrols were now found in Scottish waters even in peacetime, such as the small ship-of-the-line HMS Kingfisher, which bombarded Carrick Castle during the Earl of Argyll's rebellion in 1685. Scotland went to war against the Dutch and their allies in the Second (1665–67) and Third Anglo-Dutch Wars (1672–74) as an independent kingdom. Scottish captains, at least 80 and perhaps 120, took letters of marque, and privateers played a major part in the naval conflict of the wars.|$|E
