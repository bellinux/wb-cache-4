In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created in the greater Ganges Plain a complex system of administration and taxation that became a model for later Indian kingdoms. Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert itself. The renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite. Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.|$|E

There were still plenty of women present on the battlefields to help rescue and nurse soldiers. Some women fought alongside their husbands and sons on the battlefield. The majority of women assumed supportive and non-competitive roles such as fundraising and caring for the sick. Revolution for women meant something different than for men. Women saw revolution as a way to earn equal rights, such as voting, and to overcome the suppression of <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> to men.|$|E

500|$|Citing {{from both}} {{pornography}} and literature—including The Kreutzer Sonata, Madame Bovary, and Dracula—Dworkin argued that depictions of intercourse in mainstream {{art and culture}} consistently emphasized heterosexual intercourse as {{the only kind of}} [...] "real" [...] sex, portrayed intercourse in violent or invasive terms, portrayed the violence or invasiveness as central to its eroticism, and often united it with male contempt for, revulsion towards, or even murder of, the [...] "carnal" [...] woman. She argued that this kind of depiction enforced a male-centric and coercive view of sexuality, and that, when the cultural attitudes combine with the material conditions of women's lives in a sexist society, the experience of heterosexual intercourse itself becomes a central part of men's <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> experienced as a form of [...] "occupation" [...] that is nevertheless expected to be pleasurable for women and to define their very status as women.|$|E

In 1893 Matilda Joslyn Gage wrote the book for which she is best known, [...] "Woman, Church, and State," [...] {{which was one of}} the first books to draw the conclusion that Christianity is a primary impediment to the progress <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> as well as civilization. In 1895 Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote The Woman's Bible, revised and continued with another book of the same name in 1898, in which she criticized religion and stated [...] "the Bible in its teachings degrades women from Genesis to Revelation."

40|$|The {{present study}} {{attempts}} to analyze Margaret Atwood’s (1939 -) The Handmaid’s Tale (1985) based on theories of feminist thinker, Simone de Beauvoir (1908 - 1986) and applies her theories presented in The Second Sex (1949) {{that leads to}} better apprehension of sex and gender. Beauvoir’s ideology focuses mainly on the cultural mechanisms of oppression which cause to confine women under the title of Other to man’s self. In her view woman cannot be a simple biological category, and she asserts that womanhood is imposed on woman by civilization. In her idea, the fundamental social meaning <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> is Other. She believes that biology is the main source for woman’s oppression within patriarchal society, and challenges the discourse through which women are defined based on her biology. She also believes that sexuality is another aspect of women’s oppression and exploitation and all functions <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> In Beauvoir’s view, prostitution and heterosexuality are exploitation <b>of</b> <b>woman.</b> She rejects the heterosexuality as the norm for sexual relations. This paper tries to show how Atwood in The Handmaid’s Tale speculates feminist issues such as loss <b>of</b> identity, <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> in a male dominated society and women’s exploitation in consumer society where woman’s body is treated as an object, a tool and consumable item. Atwood focuses on the problems such as gender inequality, and pitfalls of patriarchal system for women’s oppression...|$|R

Nussbaum argues that individuals tend to repudiate their bodily imperfection or animality through the projection of fears about contamination. This cognitive response is in itself irrational, because we cannot transcend the animality of our bodies. Noting how projective disgust has wrongly justified group <b>subordination</b> (mainly <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> Jews, and homosexuals), Nussbaum ultimately discards disgust as a reliable basis of judgment.|$|R

2500|$|The Christian {{doctrine}} of the Trinity {{has become a major}} focus of the contemporary gender debate, specifically in relation to [...] In 1977, George W. Knight III argued in a book about gender roles that the <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> to men is theologically analogous to the subordination of the Son to the Father in the Trinity. Australian theologian Kevin Giles has more recently responded that complementarians have [...] "reinvented" [...] the {{doctrine of}} the Trinity to support their views of men and women, suggesting that some complementarians have adopted a heretical view of the Trinity similar to Arianism. A vigorous debate has ensued, with some egalitarians moving towards {{the idea that there is}} [...] "mutual dependence" [...] within the Trinity, including [...] "subordination of the Father to the Son", which must be reflected in gender role relations.

2500|$|The Christian egalitarian {{hermeneutic}} {{has received}} a highly systematic treatment from William J. Webb, professor of New Testament at Heritage Theological Seminary, Ontario, Canada. Webb argues that a major challenge is determining which biblical commands are [...] "transcultural" [...] and therefore applicable today, versus those which are [...] "cultural" [...] and therefore only applicable to the original (1st century) recipients of the text. His [...] "redemptive movement" [...] hermeneutic is justified using the example of slavery, which Webb sees as analogous to the <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> Christians today largely perceive that slavery was [...] "cultural" [...] in biblical times and not {{something that should be}} re-introduced or justified, although slavery was (a)found in the Bible and (b)not explicitly banned there. Webb recommends that biblical commands be examined in light of the cultural context in which they were originally written. According to the [...] "redemptive approach", slavery and women's subordination are found in the Bible; however, the same Scriptures also contain ideas and principles which, if developed and taken to their logical conclusion, would bring about the abolition of these institutions. According to that ideal, biblical patriarchy should be replaced by the [...] "all one in Christ Jesus" [...] proclamation of [...] which says [...] "There is no Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female.

60|$|The social <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> thus {{stands out}} an {{isolated}} fact in modern social institutions; a solitary breach {{of what has}} become their fundamental law; a single relic of an old world of thought and practice exploded in everything else, but retained in the one thing of most universal interest; as if a gigantic dolmen, or a vast temple of Jupiter Olympius, occupied the site of St. Paul's and received daily worship, while the surrounding Christian churches were only resorted to on fasts and festivals. This entire discrepancy between one social fact and all those which accompany it, and the radical opposition between its nature and the progressive movement which is the boast of the modern world, and which has successively swept away everything else of an analogous character, surely affords, to a conscientious observer of human tendencies, serious matter for reflection. It raises a primâ facie presumption on the unfavourable side, far outweighing any which custom and usage could in such circumstances create on the favourable; and should at least suffice to make this, like the choice between republicanism and royalty, a balanced question.|$|E
2500|$|Critics of {{marriage}} {{argue that it}} is an institution which contributes to the maintaining of traditional gender roles, thus preventing women from achieving social equality, and reinforcing the idea that women exist to serve men, which in turn increases the abuse <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> They argue that marriage reinforces the traditional paradigm <b>of</b> male-female interaction: <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>woman</b> to the man in exchange of subsistence. According to Sheila Jeffreys [...] "the traditional elements {{of marriage}} have not completely disappeared in western societies, even in the case of employed, highly educated and well paid professional women". She argues that even such women remain in abusive marriages out of fear of leaving and out of duty. Even in Western countries, married women [...] "feel they {{have no choice but to}} stay and endure and may be 'loving to survive".|$|R

60|$|The {{paradox of}} all this {{part of his life}} lies in this--that, destined as he was to be the {{greatest}} enemy of Mahomedanism, he was quite exceptionally a friend of Mahomedans. He had been first received in that land, so to speak, with a blow on the head with a club; he was destined to break the sword of the last Arab conqueror, to wreck his holy city and treat all the religious traditions of it with a deliberate desecration which has often been held oppressive and was undoubtedly ruthless. Yet with the individual Moslem he had a sort of natural brotherhood which has never been explained. Had it been shown by a soldier of the Crusades, it would have been called witchcraft. In this, as in many other cases, the advance of a larger enlightenment prevents us from calling it anything. There was mixed with it, no doubt, the deep Moslem admiration for mere masculinity, which has probably by its exaggeration permitted the Moslem <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> But Kitchener (who was himself accused, rightly or wrongly, of a disdain for women) must have himself contributed some other element to the strangest of international sympathies. Whatever it was, it must be constantly kept in mind as running parallel to his scientific industry and particularity; for it was these two powers, used systematically for many years before the event, that prepared the ground for the overthrow of that wild papacy and wandering empire which so long hung in the desert, like a mirage to mislead and to destroy.|$|E

50|$|The {{legal and}} social {{treatment}} <b>of</b> married <b>women</b> has been often discussed {{as a political}} issue from the 19th century onwards. Until the 1970s, legal <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> married <b>women</b> was common across European countries, through marriage laws giving legal authority to the husband, {{as well as through}} marriage bars. In 1978, the Council of Europe passed the Resolution (78) 37 on equality of spouses in civil law. Switzerland {{was one of the last}} countries in Europe to establish gender equality in marriage, in this country married women's rights were severely restricted until 1988, when legal reforms providing for gender equality in marriage, abolishing the legal authority of the husband, come into force (these reforms had been approved in 1985 by voters in a referendum, who narrowly voted in favor with 54.7% of voters approving). In the Netherlands, it was only in 1984 that full legal equality between husband and wife was achieved - prior to 1984 the law stipulated that the husband's opinion prevailed over the wife's regarding issues such as decisions on children's education and the domicile of the family.|$|R
40|$|This Article {{commands}} a {{more explicit}} engagement of critical race scholarship with feminist {{international human rights}} strategies. It focuses on Jamaican-American women. Part I discusses key aspects of the historical and sociological {{context in which the}} migration <b>of</b> Jamaican <b>women</b> to the New York City area has occurred. It also discusses trends in their participation in the paid labor force since the migratory patterns <b>of</b> Jamaican <b>women</b> are strongly linked to their employment opportunities. Part II describes and analyzes significant survival strategies used by working-class Jamaican-American women to escape from, reshape, or resist the exploitative conditions they face. The strategies they adopt out of necessity illustrate not only the shape-shifting, inter/national nature of the sources of their oppression, but also the creativity of their responses to them. Part III discusses the limitations of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms <b>of</b> Discrimination Against <b>Women,</b> which has been ratified by Jamaica. It also questions whether CEDAW would allow Jamaican-American women to fully address the violations they experience. Next, Part IV identifies opportunities for critical race feminist scholarship to focus on the race- and ethnicity-based <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> Black <b>women</b> immigrants in the United States. It also elaborates certain divisions within Black communities that must be addressed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} is to analyze the {{ideologies}} that appears in the novel Ladydi by Jennifer Clement. In addition we also examine how ideologies are negotiated by {{the characters in the}} book. The novel was published in 2014 and portrays how rural women in Mexico are affected by the violence related to the drug war. We define and analyze the ideologies in the book conferring with different theoretical perspectives from cultural studies. Our method is hermeneutical and we carry out our investigation following the three categories of social construction commonly studied within Latin-American cultural studies: class, gender and ethnicity. In the novel there is a correlation between these three categories. The hegemonic ideas which we identify are formed around a macho ideology and a racism which is seen as a prolongation from the colonial time. The <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>women</b> in the story therefore is doubled. We also conclude that the women negotiate their identities with these ideologies, {{at the same time as}} they filter the dominant ideologies through their personal experiences and create their own meanings and ideologies...|$|R

50|$|One {{key issue}} for {{achieving}} reproductive rights is criminalization of sexual violence. If {{a woman is}} not protected from forced sexual intercourse, she is not protected from forced pregnancy, namely pregnancy from rape. In order {{for a woman to}} be able to have reproductive rights, she must have the right to choose with whom and when to reproduce; and first of all, decide whether, when, and under what circumstances to be sexually active. In many countries, these rights <b>of</b> <b>women</b> are not respected, because women do not have a choice in regard to their partner, with forced marriage and child marriage being common in parts of the world; and neither do they have any rights in regard to sexual activity, as many countries do not allow women to refuse to engage in sexual intercourse when they do not want to (because marital rape is not criminalized in those countries) or to engage in consensual sexual intercourse if they want to (because sex outside marriage is illegal in those countries). In addition to legal barriers, there are also social barriers, because in many countries a complete sexual <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> a <b>woman</b> to her husband is expected (for instance, in one survey 74% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in Mali said that a husband is justified to beat his wife if she refuses to have sex with him), while sexual/romantic relations disapproved by family members, or generally sex outside marriage, can result in serious violence, such as honor killings.|$|R
