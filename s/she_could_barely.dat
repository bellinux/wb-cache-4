5|$|Jan Wiley {{was cast}} as Scott's wife, Virginia. Although Wiley had {{appeared}} in several movies throughout the 1930s and 1940s, The Brute Man marked one of her final film performances. It was also recalled {{as one of her}} most memorable film appearances along with another Universal Pictures B horror film, She-Wolf of London. However, her performance in The Brute Man proved to be a less than memorable one for her, so much so that in an interview shortly before Wiley's death in 1993, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> remember even having appeared in the film. Donald MacBride and Peter Whitney portray the police officers Captain M.J. Donelly and Lieutenant Gates, respectively. Their roles serve as comic relief for the film. Their characters portray the incompetence of the police force in their inability to find and arrest the Creeper and their focus on passing blame for their failures rather than diverting resources toward his arrest.|$|E
25|$|Upon her rescue Sano {{was found}} to be healthy, {{although}} extremely thin and weak due to lack of exercise: <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> walk. She was also dehydrated. Due to the lack of exposure to sunlight, she also had a very light skin tone and suffered from jaundice. While her body was that of a 19-year-old woman, mentally she acted like a child. She also suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder.|$|E
25|$|An {{anonymous}} verse lampoon entitled The Sink of Solitude appeared {{during the}} controversy over The Well. Although its primary targets were James Douglas, who had called for The Wells suppression, and the Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks, who had started legal proceedings, it also mocked Hall and her book. One of the illustrations, which depicted Hall nailed to a cross, so horrified her that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> speak of it for years afterward. Her sense of guilt at being depicted in a drawing that she saw as blasphemous led to her choice of a religious subject for her next novel, The Master of the House.|$|E
50|$|Mancuso won {{the race}} despite ongoing pain in her right knee, which was finally traced to hip dysplasia. She would finish the 2006 season in eighth place, {{including}} podium finishes in three races, although <b>she</b> <b>could</b> sometimes <b>barely</b> walk by season's end.|$|R
5000|$|Louis {{had earlier}} been engaged to Sibylle's elder sister Sidonie, but Sidonie had died before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> marry, <b>barely</b> 17 years old. [...] The {{marriage}} was {{the starting point}} of the relaxation of the relations between Bavaria and the Palatinate, which were severely impacted by the Landshut War of Succession. [...] Relationships between the Palatinate and Emperor Maximilian I, who was Sibylle's uncle, also improved and Louis came closer politically to the Contra League.|$|R
60|$|The last scanty {{measure of}} food was soon prepared; it was bitter and {{unpalatable}} when <b>she</b> tasted it--life <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> be preserved, {{even in the}} most vigorous, by provision so wretched; but she set it aside as carefully {{as if it had been}} the most precious luxury of the most abundant feast.|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Jimmy Kimmel on his nightly talk show, Stefani said <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> believe that the performance occurred. According to Los Angeles Times and Music Times reviews, [...] "She had personally worked on it continuously for about six days", from [...] "7 in the morning 'til 3 in the morning". On February 22, 2016, Billboard reported that the video cost an estimated $12 million, {{making it one of}} the most-expensive music videos ever made. About $8 million was used to buy airtime, with the remainder spent on production.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the action}} Tripoli was {{severely}} damaged; 30of her crew were dead and another 30were injured. The polacca's first lieutenant was among the casualties and Admiral Rous himself was injured in the fighting. In what amounted to a total American victory over the Tripolitans, Enterprise had suffered only superficial damage and no casualties. [...] Sterett, whose orders did not give him the authority to retain prizes, let the polacca limp back to Tripoli. However, before setting her free, the Americans cut down Tripoli masts and sufficiently disabled her so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> make sail. Sterett then continued his journey to Malta and picked up the supplies for which he was sent before returning to the blockade.|$|E
500|$|Romney {{is an avid}} equestrian, {{crediting}} her renewed {{involvement in}} it while in Park City, Utah (where the couple had built a vacation home and where they lived {{when he was in}} charge of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games), for much of her recovery after her multiple sclerosis diagnosis [...] and for her continued ability to deal with the disease. [...] She has said that riding [...] "saved my life", explaining that, [...] "I was losing most of the function of my right side. And I decided I needed to go back and do what I loved before I couldn't do it anymore." [...] At first <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> stay on a horse without getting tired, but gradually the muscle control required for riding proved directly beneficial, and psychologically, [...] "Riding exhilarated me; it gave me a joy and a purpose. When I was so fatigued that I couldn't move, the excitement of going to the barn and getting my foot in the stirrup would make me crawl out of bed." [...] As a result, she said, [...] "My desire to ride was, and is, so strong that I kept getting healthier and healthier." ...|$|E
60|$|Nor did Yvonne Dewhurst {{attempt to}} make reply to her enemy's delirious talk. She would not give him even the paltry {{satisfaction}} of feeling that he had stung her into a retort. She did not fear him--she hated him too much for that--but like her father she had no illusions as to his power over them both. While he stormed and raved {{she kept her eyes}} steadily fixed upon him. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> only just <b>barely</b> distinguish him in the gloom, and he no doubt failed to see the expression of lofty indifference wherewith she contrived to regard him: but he felt her contempt, and but for the presence of the sailors on the deck he probably would have struck her.|$|R

2500|$|Woman age 28, {{five months}} {{pregnant}} (2001): Patient described the pain {{four days after}} abortion as being so bad <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> walk. The patient described that upon returning to the clinic because of the pain, ultrasound showed fetal remains left inside her uterus, and that Gosnell suctioned these out without anesthesia. [...] "I was just laying {{on the table and}} crying and I just asked the Lord to get me through it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her {{most famous}} poem, [...] "Solitude", was first {{published}} in the February 25, 1883 (?) issue of The New York Sun. The inspiration for the poem came as she was travelling to attend the Governor's inaugural ball in Madison, Wisconsin. On her way to the celebration, there was a young woman dressed in black sitting across the aisle from her. The woman was crying. Miss Wheeler sat next to her and sought to comfort her {{for the rest of the}} journey. When they arrived, the poet was so depressed that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> attend the scheduled festivities. As she looked at her own radiant face in the mirror, she suddenly recalled the sorrowful widow. It was at that moment that she wrote the opening lines of [...] "Solitude": ...|$|E
2500|$|At this time, {{the main}} engines of Louisiana had been installed, but {{those for the}} screws, needed for steering, had not. Furthermore, the main engines {{were found to be}} inadequate; even at dangerously high boiler pressure, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> make headway against the river current. Unable to move on her own, she had to be towed down to the forts, with workmen still aboard. [...] There she was tied to the left bank (here, {{the north side of the}} river) a short {{distance}} above Fort St. Philip. This did not completely mollify General Duncan, who wanted the ship to be positioned below the forts, but Commander Whittle would not risk his vessel, with unarmored deck, against the plunging fire of the Union mortars. She remained at this position throughout the ensuing battle.|$|E
50|$|In November 1926, Demjanovich became ill. After a tonsillectomy, she {{returned}} to the convent, but <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> walk to her room. After a few days, she asked if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> return to the infirmary, but her superior, thinking it odd that someone so young could be so sick, told her, “Pull yourself together.” When Bradley saw how sick she was, he notified her brother, who called one of their sisters who was a nurse. She went to the convent and immediately took Sister Miriam to the hospital, where she was diagnosed with “physical and nervous exhaustion, with myocarditis and acute appendicitis.” Doctors did not think she was strong enough for an operation and her condition worsened.|$|R

2500|$|Enya's {{first solo}} {{endeavour}} arrived in 1983 when she recorded two piano instrumentals, [...] "An Ghaoth Ón Ghrian", Gaelic for [...] "The Solar Wind", and [...] "Miss Clare Remembers", at Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin which were released on Touch Travel (1984), a limited release audio cassette {{of music from}} various artists on the Touch label. She is credited as [...] "Eithne Ní Bhraonáin" [...] on its liner notes. After several months of preparation, Enya's debut solo performance took place on 23 September 1983 at the National Stadium in Dublin that was televised for RTÉ's music show Festival Folk. Nial Morris, a musician who worked with her during this time, recalled she [...] "was so nervous <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> get on stage, and she cowered behind the piano until the gig was over." ...|$|E
2500|$|Preminger {{began to}} {{assemble}} his cast. Harry Belafonte, a folk singer who recently had introduced Calypso music to a mainstream audience, {{had only one}} film to his credit, but he had just won the Tony Award and Theatre World Award for his performance in John Murray Anderson's Almanac, and Preminger cast him as Joe. Pearl Bailey's sole screen credit was the 1948 film Isn't It Romantic?, but she had achieved success as a band singer and was familiar to television audiences from her appearances on Your Show of Shows, so she was assigned the role of Frankie. Joe Adams was a Los Angeles disc jockey with no acting experience, but Preminger felt {{he had the right}} look for Husky. Diahann Carroll auditioned for the title role, but she was so terrified of the director <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> focus on the scene, and Preminger cast her in the small supporting role of Myrt instead. Finally, every black actress from Eartha Kitt to Joyce Bryant was tested for the role of Carmen.|$|E

'Oh! the thankfulness--' she said; but {{she could}} not go on, she must stifle all that swelled within her, for the babe felt each throb of her beating heart; and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> keep from {{bursting}} into tears as his father kissed him; then, as he marked the still sobbing breath, said, 'Bowles must see him again.' ...|$|E
60|$|For {{several moments}} she listened.

6000|$|Mr. James it was, but the {{expected}} rebuke for keeping him waiting was not spoken. As {{he saw her}} sorrowful looks, he only said, low and softly, 'Is it so, Charlotte?'

60|$|Shy and {{reserved}} as both were, and almost incapable of finding expression for their feelings, they still clung closely together, though the only tears {{the girl was}} seen to shed came in church on the last Sunday evening, blinding and choking, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> restrain her sobs. Her father would have taken her out, but she resisted, and leant against him, while {{he put his arm}} round her. After this, whenever it was possible, she crept up to him, and he held her close.|$|E
