40|$|Adolescent {{obesity is}} {{positively}} associated with <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> consumption. We investigated the association of social-environmental and individual-level factors with <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> consumption in a Dutch adolescent sample. Data were gathered in a longitudinal Dutch adolescent sample (n = 208, 62 % girls). <b>Soft</b> <b>drink</b> consumption, social cognitions from the Theory of Planned Behaviour and parenting practices towards limited <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> intake, and Big Five personality dimensions were assessed. Data were analyzed using three-step linear regression analyses. Effect sizes were used as the informational source for the explanatory value of the model. Interaction terms were computed to test the individual-environment interaction. Attitude and subjective norm {{were significantly associated with}} <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> consumption. When controlling for social cognitions, the distal variables parenting practices and the personality dimension Agreeableness remained significantly associated with <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> consumption. Agreeableness moderated the association of parenting practices with adolescent <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> consumption. Standardized regression coefficients ranged from 0. 16 to 0. 24 and explained 14 % of the variance in <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> consumption, indicating a medium effect size. Stricter parenting practices were associated with less <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> consumption and these effects were moderated by adolescent personality. The direct effects of practices and personality are noteworthy from a theoretical perspective. Implications for obesity prevention interventions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{aimed to}} examine the changes in sugar-sweetened <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> intake across the Capital Region of Denmark from 2007 to 2013 and {{to examine the}} {{association}} between intake and neighbourhood socioeconomic status. The study included data from three health surveys in 2007 (n= 30, 426), 2010 (n= 42, 218) and 2013 (n= 34, 330) in the Capital Region of Denmark. Frequency of <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> intake was derived from questionnaires among residents aged 25 – 79 years and linked with information from central registers. Municipality social groups (MSG) 1 – 4 of decreasing affluence were defined as a composite measure. Logistic regression analyses were conducted for individuals with an appropriate <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> intake (<once/week) and for individuals with a frequent <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> intake (≥ 3 times/week). The proportion of individuals reporting an appropriate <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> intake increased by 71 % during 2007 – 2013 (p< 0. 0001). A corresponding decrease {{was found in the}} proportion of individuals reporting a frequent <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> intake. Compared to MSG 1, odds of an appropriate <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> intake were significantly lower in MSG 3 – 4 : OR= 0. 87 (95 %CI 0. 83 – 0. 91) and OR= 0. 89 (95 %CI 0. 85 – 0. 92), respectively. Compared to MSG 1, odds of a frequent <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> intake were significantly higher in MSG 3 – 4 : OR= 1. 24 (95 %CI 1. 63 – 1. 31) and 1. 17 (95 %CI 1. 10 – 1. 25), respectively. A significant interaction between MSG and educational level was found among individuals reporting a frequent <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> intake (p= 0. 02). The results show an encouraging reduction in frequency of <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> intake among capital residents in the period of 2007 – 2013. A social gradient was observed in <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> intake across MSG...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> consumption {{is related to}} fighting and bullying behaviour among school-aged children and whether nervousness and irritation mediated this relationship. The data on 7583 adolescents aged 11 - 15 years from the Slovak part of the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) study 2010 were analysed. Self-reported <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> intake, bullying, fighting, nervousness, irritability and confounding variables were analysed using logistic regressions. To assess the potential mediation of daily nervousness and irritability on the association between <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> consumption and aggressive behaviour, we used Sobel tests. Adolescents' daily <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> consumption was associated with bullying and fighting, and these relationships were partially mediated by nervousness and irritability. Adjustment of the analyses on gender, age and family affluence did not change the estimates. Adolescents' daily <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> consumption was associated with negative mood deviations such as nervousness and irritability and with aggressive behaviour {{in the form of}} bullying and fighting. Our findings provide new evidence about <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> consumption-related risks and thus can contribute to the preventive actions aimed at reducing them...|$|R

5|$|Beer {{ranges from}} less than 3% alcohol by volume (abv) to around 14% abv, though this {{strength}} can be increased to around 20% by re-pitching with champagne yeast, and to 55% abv by the freeze-distilling process.
