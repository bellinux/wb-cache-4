5|$|News of {{his death}} spread in Kenema and its environs like a bush fire in the harmattan. Most people were devastated {{to learn that the}} only Lassa Fever {{specialist}} in Sierra Leone was gone, gone forever. Nurses cried, patients wept.

5|$|Isolated {{inside the}} Tower, the royal {{government}} {{was in a}} <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> {{at the turn of}} events. The King left the castle that morning and made his way to negotiate with the rebels at Mile End in east London, taking only a very small bodyguard with him. The King left Sudbury and Hales behind in the Tower, either for their own safety or because Richard had decided it would be safer to distance himself from his unpopular ministers. Along the way, several Londoners accosted the King to complain about alleged injustices.|$|E
5|$|Modhusudhon Tarafdar (Naseeruddin Shah) is a Bengali {{doctor who}} rescues Susanna from a suicide attempt (when she learns about Arun's marriage) {{and puts her}} on a {{mushroom}}-only diet. Although {{she does not want}} to marry him, Tarafdar persuades her with a promise that she will be the sole heir of his property. Actually bankrupt, he tries to poison Susanna with mushroom soup several years later for her inheritance. Her butler drinks it by accident and dies instead; in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock,</b> she shoots Tarafdar during a game of Russian roulette. That night, Susanna sets her house ablaze in another suicide attempt. Seeing the house on fire, her maid (who has six toes) tries to rescue her but dies in the attempt.|$|E

5|$|Veltmann {{denied that}} there was a mutinous conspiracy, saying the men were in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> {{stemming}} from the horrific explosion and the subsequent cleanup of human body parts belonging to their former battalion mates. He said the conversations at Camp Shoemaker were simply those of men who were trying to understand what had happened, and that these discussions were not mutinous nor could they provide the groundwork for conspiracy. Veltmann argued that Small's brief four- or five-minute speech to the men on the barge was given in the performance of his duty to maintain order, a duty placed upon him by his superiors. Veltmann restated that the established legal definition of mutiny was a concerted effort to usurp, subvert or override military authority, and that there had been no such action or intent. Refusal to obey an order was not mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Ann soon arrives, {{discovering}} Gil cowering in {{the cellar}} in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock.</b> Believing that he is beyond help, Gil at first refuses to see Dr. Hoffman, but after Ann's tearful pleading, Gil reluctantly agrees. During the examination, Dr. Hoffman orders Gil {{to remain in the}} house at all times as a precaution until he can return with help. Feeling guilty for leaving Trudy, Gil returns to the bar but is brutally beaten by George and his gang. Gil regains consciousness the next morning and discovers that Trudy, having felt sorry for him, brought him home to her apartment. George soon arrives and, upon seeing Gil, forces him at gunpoint out into the daylight. Transforming into the creature, Gil murders George in front of the horrified Trudy before fleeing into the hills. Returning to the house, Gil finds Ann, Dr. Hoffman and Buckell waiting there and returns to his normal human state. A disturbed Gil later admits to the murder, with the others assuring him that he acted in self-defense, but when the police arrive with an arrest warrant, the hysterical Gil flees from the grounds in his car and accidentally hits a police officer.|$|E
5|$|In {{trying to}} find a way to escape before the dome rises, Ryouta and Sakuya uncover records in the library {{mentioning}} a medical center that was shut down due to a fire, and that the ghostly Nageki, who Ryouta previously encountered, died in that fire. Sakuya deduces that an unused building on campus was the medical center and after investigating, they find its basement blocked off. They also encounter Anghel, who recalls the protagonist going into the infirmary the day before, contradicting Yuuya and Shuu's shared alibi. As Ryouta searches the infirmary for clues, he finds medical records for himself, the protagonist, Nageki, and Sakuya, but is knocked out immediately after. When he regains consciousness, he discovers the protagonist's bloody student ID—now with concrete evidence, Ryouta prepares to confront the doctor and Yuuya, only to find that Sakuya had left to do so alone. Ryouta returns to the infirmary as Yuuya shields Sakuya from Shuu's attempts to kill him; the doctor tells Ryouta that he will be waiting for him in the medical center's basement before escaping with Labor 9. Yuuya apologizes, affirming that while neither he nor Shuu killed the protagonist, they were the ones who dismembered her, and asks to speak to Sakuya alone. He reveals that they are full-blooded siblings, with Shuu using knowledge of Sakuya's true heritage to blackmail Yuuya into assisting him. Yuuya dies, Shuu's scalpel having been laced with the same neurotoxin that killed the headmaster, leaving Sakuya in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock.</b>|$|E
30|$|Hypoperfusion of {{peripheral}} mesenteric arteries can {{be caused}} by different mechanisms and the risk of developing NOMI increases with age. Cardiovascular and drug related factors are risk factors and also various forms <b>of</b> <b>shock,</b> septicemia, dehydration and hypotension following dialysis and heart surgery or major abdominal surgery [47, 51].

5|$|Sophie {{was one of}} Mozart 's pups seen on Meerkat Manor. She had two {{brothers}} and one sister named Sparkle. Only one of her brothers was given a name and he was called Spud. They were born some time after Tosca, Mozart's sister, gave birth to three pups. Their uncle Yossarian decided to move their pups who {{were only a few}} days old. He brought each up above ground and started to move them to a new burrow. The babysitters followed him and carried each pup. The Whiskers returned and Yossarian dropped the pup he was carrying, who was Sophie's sister. Her sister got left behind and died later that night. The other pups were moved to the new burrow. One day, while being babysat by Yossarian, Mitch, Sophie's other uncle, viciously attacked her without warning. Yossarian failed to stop the assault and simply waited until Mitch was proud of the beating. Afterwards, little Sophie was in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock,</b> but thankfully Tosca gave Sophie a comforting cuddle. Sophie didn't re-appear in the series until much later, when she was older. She was seen babysitting a litter, but was finding them a bit of a handful. That was the last time Sophie was mentioned in Season 1. In this season and up until season 3, she was played by Tina Sparkle since the real Sophie was the one Youssarian unintentionally killed.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{defection}} of {{some former}} supporters, many Zuma supporters continued to rally outside the courthouse, arousing criticism by anti-rape groups for regular {{attacks on the}} integrity and moral standing of Zuma's accuser, insults yelled at {{a close friend of}} the accuser, and even stones thrown at a woman that members of the crowd mistook for the accuser. Zuma's defence team introduced evidence relating to the woman's sexual past, and asserted that the sex that took place was consensual. The prosecution asserted that her lack of resistance was due to a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock,</b> and that {{the relationship between the two}} was like that of a 'father-daughter' pair.|$|E

25|$|Occasionally, scourging preceded crucifixion, {{which would}} cause the {{condemned}} to lose {{a large amount of}} blood, and approach a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock.</b> The convict then usually had to carry the horizontal beam (patibulum in Latin) to the place of execution, but not necessarily the whole cross. Crucifixion was typically carried out by specialized teams, consisting of a commanding centurion and four soldiers. When it was done in an established place of execution, the vertical beam (stipes) could even be permanently embedded in the ground. It's claimed by certain religious texts that the victims of crucifixion were stripped naked before being put on the cross—all the New Testament gospels describe soldiers gambling for the robes of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|Frost, Sebastian Shaw and Donald Pierce are {{targeted}} by Selene for betraying her {{years ago in}} her plan to ascend to godhood.

However, in the aftermath Selene's inner circle succeed in capturing Warpath, injuring Angel and ruthlessly killing Onyxx and Diamond Lil before returning to Necrosha. Frost recognizes that the threat will not end until Selene and her inner circle are permanently stopped, and orders X-Force to travel to Necrosha and kill them all, including Wither.|$|E
25|$|Command of {{the ship}} thereby devolved upon the ship's third officer, Charles Rivers, but Rivers, {{apparently}} in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock,</b> proved incapable of action. Fortunately, one {{of the ship}}'s small complement of passengers, Cornelius L. Brady, was a ships' master himself with recent experience of such a crisis. Brady had been the hero in the shipwreck of the SS Atlantic {{less than a year}} prior, where his courageous action in personally establishing a rope to shore was credited with saving as many as 250 lives. Now he was now about to lead another rescue effort. Brady quickly ordered the crew to secure the damaged upper forward hatches with hatches from the lower deck, in order to stop the further flow of water into the ship. A delegation of the crew then implored Brady to take command, a proposal which he accepted. Brady made his way ondeck to the midships wheelhouse, where he ordered the helmsman to turn the ship into the wind. He then rang the engine room to reduce the ship's speed to dead slow.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} hyperbolic 1 -conservation laws. Such laws {{appear in}} problems of traffic flow, flood waves, and chemical exchange processes, etc., {{as illustrated by}} Whitham.

40|$|In the {{preceding}} papers {{of this series}} (1 - 3) it has been indicated {{that one of the}} consequences <b>of</b> hemorrhagic <b>shock</b> in the rat is a failure of hepatic function due to diminished blood flow and oxygen supply to the liver. The object of the experiments reported in this paper was {{to examine the effects of}} hemorrhage on the liver and kidney more directly by comparing the rates of respiration of liver and kidney slices from normal rats and from rats in progressively severe <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock.</b> In addition, experiments were carried out to test how far any tissue changes taking place after hemorrhage might be accounted for simply by anoxia. Methods and Materials Male albino rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain, weighing 250 to 300 gin., were used throughout these experiments. The animals were fed a diet of purina dog chow and in all instances were fasted for 24 hours before being studied. All experiments were performed under light anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital (nembutal) administered intraperitoneally, in a dose of 4 ms. per 100 gin...|$|R
25|$|Two {{months after}} the murder of Thomas Lundgren, on August 4, 1979, Bonin and Butts {{abducted}} a 17-year-old named Mark Shelton shortly after the youth left his Westminster home to walk to a movie theater near Beach Boulevard. Screams were heard from {{the vicinity of the}} Shelton household by neighbors, leaving a strong possibility Shelton was abducted by force. The youth was violated with foreign objects including a pool cue, causing his body to enter a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> which proved fatal. His body was then discarded in San Bernardino County. The following day, Bonin and Butts encountered a 17-year-old West German student named Markus Grabs attempting to hitchhike from Pacific Coast Highway. Grabs was bound with lengths of cord and ignition wire and driven to Bonin's home where he was sodomized, beaten, and stabbed a total of 77 times before his nude body was discarded in Malibu Creek, close to Las Virgenes Canyon Road. His body was found the following morning, with one investigator likening the network of injuries inflicted upon the victim to that of a rabid dog unable to determine when to cease biting.|$|E
25|$|At 11:15 that morning, Fred {{formally}} {{admitted to}} police he had indeed killed his daughter, albeit {{in an act}} of manslaughter. He confessed to strangling Heather in a fit of rage before dismembering her body in the ground floor bathroom with a heavy serrated knife he normally used for cutting slabs of frozen meat. Her remains had been stored in a dustbin as he waited for an opportunity to dig her grave. Fred was insistent his wife had no knowledge of her daughter's murder, claiming he had committed this murder as Rose was preoccupied with one of her clients, adding the fact the search team had not yet unearthed Heather's remains was because they had been excavating the wrong section of his garden. He then volunteered to accompany police to the house to pinpoint the precise location of Heather's body. Upon receipt of this confession, Fred's solicitor, Howard Ogden, and his appointed appropriate adult, Janet Leach, informed Mae and Stephen their father had confessed to their sister's murder. In response, Stephen slumped against a wall and began sobbing; Mae entered a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock,</b> before stammering that her father had not killed her sister.|$|E
25|$|Position 1 was {{destroyed}} and buried its inhabitants, {{who were in}} a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> when evacuated from the rubble. The telephone system was cut down. A machine gun, aimed at the planes, {{was hit by a}} shell. Most of the Israelis' firearms got dirty from the dust, and one machine gun broke down. Since the beginning of the attack, the signal operator tried to contact the 53rd Battalion headquarters at Beer Tuvia. At 10:00, she managed to get an SOS through before losing contact completely. Near 11:00, four Egyptian tanks were ordered to break through into the farmstead, followed by infantry. The tanks advanced from the northeastern corner of the camp, and were met by two Israelis armed with PIATs. They managed to hit the track of one of the tanks on the second shot. The tanks halted, but the PIAT soon broke down and its operator suffered a head wound. The tanks retreated and continued to shell the Israeli position. The Egyptian infantry kept advancing, taking over positions 10, 11, 12, and capturing the water tanks area. The Egyptians reported victory. Twelve Israelis were killed by the tank shells.|$|E
40|$|Sam Shepard {{is one of}} {{the most}} prolific, influential, and celebrated playwrights that the United States has {{produced}} in contemporary era. In his plays, America is complete with traditional and mythical symbols. He uses these emblems in order to subvert their meanings and manifest the discrepancies between characters’ living in the West and the realities they confront. In his later plays, including <b>States</b> <b>of</b> <b>Shock,</b> and Kicking a Dead Horse, Sam Shepard reflects on the traditional meanings of myth and their erasure in the postmodern societies. Furthermore, the postmodern universe in these three plays is bombarded with representation and distortions of reality and hyperreality. The characters enter in simulations of reality after accepting the fact that the true reality doesn’t exist. As a matter of fact, myths are not real; they are simulations of the past myths.

50|$|The final wave of mass shootings began {{several months}} later. A {{large group of}} Jews from the school {{building}} (renamed Camp Kopernikus) were transported to the Jewish cemetery on Christmas Eve of 24 December 1942 and murdered there; those who remained (around 250 slave workers) were killed on 10 January 1943 following the Kopernikus prisoner revolt. The SS surrounded the premises planning a deportation action, but the prisoners locked themselves inside and resisted, putting the SS in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shocked</b> disbelief. After a struggle, the building was eventually set on fire and burned down with the Jews inside. Meanwhile, at the K. Rudzki foundry (renamed Krupp AG) over 100 Jewish workers were extracted on 5 June 1943, and executed as the last. The Ghetto was no more. An underground resistance movement developed in Mińsk, and later the Polish Home Army (AK) {{got a chance to}} retaliate.
