50|$|Magnetic <b>shaft</b> <b>couplings</b> {{are most}} often used for liquid pumps and {{propeller}} systems, since a static, physical barrier can be placed between the two shafts to separate the fluid from the motor operating in air. Magnetic <b>shaft</b> <b>couplings</b> preclude the use of shaft seals, which eventually wear out and fail from the sliding of two surfaces against each another. Magnetic couplings are also used for ease of maintenance on systems that typically require precision alignment, when physical <b>shaft</b> <b>couplings</b> are used, since they allow a greater off axis error between the motor and driven shaft.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, some of {{the effects}} of {{unbalance}} on the nonlinear response and stability of flexible rotor-bearing systems is presented from both a theoretical and experimental standpoint. In a linear system, operating above its stability threshold, the amplitude of motion grows exponentially with time and the orbits become unbounded. In an actual system, this is not necessarily the case. The actual amplitudes of motion may be bounded due to various nonlinear effects in the system. These nonlinear effects cause limit cycles of motion. Nonlinear effects are inherent in fluid film bearings and seals. Other contributors to nonlinear effects are <b>shafts,</b> <b>couplings</b> and foundations. In addition to affecting the threshold of stability, the nonlinear effects can cause jump phenomena to occur at not only the critical speeds, but also at stability onset or restabilization speeds...|$|R

Torsional vibration {{is often a}} concern in power transmission systems using rotating <b>shafts</b> or <b>couplings</b> where it can cause failures if not controlled.

40|$|This books {{contains}} the Proceedings of the 4 th International Conference on Power Transmissions, {{that was held}} in Sinaia, Romania from June 20 - 23, 2012. Power Transmissions {{is a very complex}} and multi-disciplinary scientific field of Mechanical Engineering that covers the different types of transmissions (mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic) as well as all the machine elements involved, such as gears, bearings, <b>shafts,</b> <b>couplings</b> and a lot more. It concerns not only their basic theory but also their design, analysis, testing, application and maintenance. The requirements set to modern power transmissions are really tough to meet: They need to be more efficient, stronger, smaller, noiseless, easier to produce and to cost less. There is a strong demand to become easier in operation and maintenance, or even automatic and in maintenance-free. Last but not least, they should be easily recycled and respect the environment. Joint efforts of specialists from both academia and industry can significantly contribute to fulfill these needs. The main goal of this conference was to bring together experts {{from all over the world}} and present the latest developments in the field of Power Transmissions...|$|R

Some mechanical systems, however, operate with a static load torque at constant speed (e. g. hoists, elevators, etc.), where it is necessary to consider the suitability of shaft coupling in terms of load torque at transient conditions (run-up and braking).

40|$|Modern wind {{turbines}} are enormous large-scale electromechanical systems. They operate in complex conditions, {{determined by a}} turbulent wind field, by possible disturbances in the electricity grid and by the behavior of sea waves for offshore turbines. Guaranteeing the structural integrity of these machines during a lifetime of 20 years is an enormous challenge. In this paper the dynamics of a wind turbine drive train high speed subsystem is studied both by modeling and experiments with focus on system torsional and flexural vibrations and transient events which can reduce fatigue life of functional components (gearbox, bearings, <b>shafts,</b> <b>couplings,</b> others). A scaled down drive train high speed shaft test rig has been developed. Main components of the test rig are six-pole motor with variable frequency drive controller (up to 1000 rpm), shafts' disk coupling and flexible mounting structure representing gearbox housing with output high speed bearing.

A factory was acquired in Montgomery Street, Sparkbrook, Birmingham, known as the Armourer Works. In his new factory, Lanchester designed a new ten horsepower twin cylinder engine. He decided to use a worm drive transmission and designed a machine to cut the worm gears. He patented this machine in 1905 and it continued for 25 years to produce all of the Lanchester worm gears. He also introduced the use of splined <b>shafts</b> and <b>couplings</b> in place of keys and keyways, another innovation that he patented. The back axle had roller bearings and Lanchester designed the machines to make these. His car was designed with the engine placed between the two front seats {{rather than at the}} front, and also had a side mounted tiller rather than a steering wheel. The transmission also included a system similar to modern disc brakes that clamped the clutch disc for braking, rather than using a separate system as in most cars.|$|R

If the shaft system of a coupled compressor is not adequately designed, {{or if the}} motor malfunctions, this torsional excitation will have destructive effect. Recently, mathematical models for this system have been solved by direct integration on both analog and digital computers. Important aspects of the model include: representation of the electrical power feed network for the motor, an equivalent circuit description of the motor itself, and a non-linear characterization of the <b>shafts</b> and <b>couplings</b> connecting the compressors to the motor. In parallel with this analytical effort it was recognized that the instantaneous magnitude of the excitation torque and its resultant shaft stress should be measured during field installation. In order to accomplish this, a torsional acceleration monitor, which {{is attached to the}} uncoupled synchronous motor, was developed to gauge the actual torques being applied to the compressor on startup. In addition, a strain measurement system utilizing telemetry was assembled to obtain shaft stress levels. These two instrumentation packages have been used to insure safe operation, detect motor starting malfunctions, and verify the analytical design of the shaft/coupling system.

It is therefore necessary to control their dangerous torsional vibrations. It was confirmed that dangerous torsional vibration can be reduced to acceptable level by an appropriate adjustment, respectively by tuning the TOMS. According to several authors, the most appropriate way of system tuning is application of suitable flexible element, which is flexible shaft coupling.
