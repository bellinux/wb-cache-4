25|$|The {{details of}} the {{engagement}} are not clear. The Genoese Annales Ianuenses claims that when the signal to attack was given, only fourteen Genoese ships advanced, while the rest <b>stood</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> then suddenly fled. The Venetian chronicler Canale, however, records that the Venetian ships attacked first, while the Genoese were trying to ambush them. The battle ended in a clear Venetian victory: the Genoese fleet, half of which failed to engage at all, lost many men, including an admiral and two of their flagships, before breaking off and fleeing. Canale claimed 1,000 Genoese losses as compared to 420 Venetian casualties. At any rate, the outcome was clearly the result of both the divided command of the Genoese fleet, and the reluctance, consistently displayed in earlier and later engagements, of the Genoese admirals to risk their ships: this was because the Genoese ships were fitted by private contractors, usually the rich noble merchants who ran the city, and thus constituted valuable assets for which the admirals were answerable.|$|E
500|$|Mudhoney {{recorded}} the song at Seattle's Reciprocal Recording studio in March 1988, {{three months after}} the band's formation. Producer Jack Endino was surprised by how noisy the sessions were and how dirty the band wanted the guitars to sound; [...] "for the most part, I just sort of <b>stood</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> let them go at it". Guitarist Steve Turner said that the band selected two of their [...] "grungiest" [...] songs for the single. [...] "Sweet Young Thing Ain't Sweet No More" [...] was to be the A-side of the single and [...] "Touch Me I'm Sick" [...] the B-side before, in drummer Dan Peters's words, [...] "that all got flipped around".|$|E
500|$|Artist Dave Gibbons, who had {{collaborated with}} Moore on {{previous}} projects, recalled he [...] "must have {{heard on the}} grapevine {{that he was doing}} a treatment for a new miniseries. I rang Alan up, saying Iâ€™d like to be involved with what he was doing." [...] and Moore sent him the story outline. Gibbons told Giordano he wanted to draw the series Moore proposed and Moore approved. Gibbons brought colorist John Higgins onto the project because he liked his [...] "unusual" [...] style; Higgins lived near the artist, which allowed the two to [...] "discuss [...] and have some kind of human contact rather than just sending it across the ocean". Len Wein joined the project as its editor, while Giordano stayed on to oversee it. Both Wein and Giordano <b>stood</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> [...] "got out of their way"; Giordano remarked later, [...] "Who copy-edits Alan Moore, for God's sake?" ...|$|E

25|$|The {{two-level}} approach involves {{engaging in}} critical reasoning and considering {{all the possible}} ramifications of one's actions before making an ethical decision, but reverting to generally reliable moral rules when one {{is not in a}} position to <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> examine the dilemma as a whole. In practice, this equates to adhering to rule consequentialism when one can only reason on an intuitive level, and to act consequentialism when in a position to <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> reason on a more critical level.|$|R
500|$|Tallon's non-selection for the 1938 Ashes touring party {{surprised}} commentators. In selection deliberations, Bradman had {{lobbied for}} Tallon and Walker, asserting that Oldfield was past his best. The other two selectors, Chappie Dwyer from New South Wales and Bill Johnson from Victoria, outvoted Bradman. They selected Barnett, {{because of his}} previous tour to England, and Walker. Tallon's omission was overshadowed by that of Grimmett, regarded alongside Bill O'Reilly as the world's leading legspinner. No official reason was given for Tallon's non-selection. A leak revealed {{that the reason for}} his omission was that he was not familiar with the bowling of Australia's three spinners: O'Reilly, Chuck Fleetwood-Smith and Frank Ward. [...] Another was Tallon's preference in standing back to medium pacers. In reality, Tallon <b>stood</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> stood up to the stumps depending on the situation. While the medium pacers were swinging the ball, he would stand back to avoid the risk of missing an edge. When the ball was old, he would stand up to the stumps when a medium pacer was operating and effect many stumpings with his fast reflexes.|$|E

If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced {{you have a chance to}} swim to the other side." [...] The donor heart came from a young woman, Denise Darvall, who had been rendered brain dead in an accident on 2 December 1967, while crossing a street in Cape Town. On examination at Groote Schuur hospital, Darvall had two serious fractures in her skull, with no electrical activity in her brain detected, and no sign of pain when ice water was poured into her ear. [...] Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman requested permission from Darvall's father for Denise's heart to be used in the transplant attempt. The afternoon before his first transplant, Barnard dozed at his home while listening to music. [...] When he awoke, he decided to modify Shumway and Lower's technique. [...] Instead of cutting straight across the back of the atrial chambers of the donor heart, he would avoid damage to the septum and instead cut two small holes for the venae cavae and pulmonary veins. [...] Prior to the transplant, rather than wait for Darvall's heart to stop beating, at his brother Marius Barnard's urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into her heart to paralyse it and render her technically dead by the whole-body standard. Twenty years later, Marius Barnard recounted, [...] "Chris stood there for a few moments, watching, then <b>stood</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> said, 'It works.'" ...|$|E
