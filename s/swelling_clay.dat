40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a new methodology {{for determining the}} elastic moduli of <b>swelling</b> <b>clay</b> minerals based on the combination of two original elements: (a) a natural multi-millimetric vermiculite crystal considered as a model system of <b>swelling</b> <b>clay</b> minerals and (b) a mechanical device that allows for mechanical compression in a controlled hydric state while concomitantly measuring the resulting strain field using the digital image correlation (DIC) method. Following this approach, the DIC method can (a) identify anomalous areas of the strain field to be excluded from an elastic analysis and (b) not introduce any assumptions for Poisson's ratio, as often required in other techniques (e. g., nanoindentation). This approach was applied to a vermiculite crystal, with dimensions of 5 x 5 mm(2) and a thickness of 1 mm; the value obtained for the undrained uniaxial Young's modulus was 323 +/- 3. 9 GPa.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Swelling</b> <b>clays</b> have {{properties}} {{which are}} detrimental to civil infrastructure and also have properties which are sought by petroleum, environmental, pharmaceutical and nanocomposite materials industry. Macroscale properties of clay largely depend on molecular level interactions and its microstructure. Developing understanding and tools for bridging length scales for predicting and tailoring properties of <b>swelling</b> <b>clays</b> {{has been the}} primary focus of this paper. Steered molecular dynamics simulations are used to evaluate the mechanical response of dry and hydrated sodium montmorillonite. The mechanisms of clay water interactions are found, the nature of water in the interlayer, contribution of various constituents of the system to the properties are evaluated quantitatively. Fundamental parameters necessary for steered molecular dynamics simulations are calculated. A new discrete element modelling technique incorporating particle subdivision is developed for accurate modelling of evolution of microstructure in <b>swelling</b> <b>clays.</b> Complimentary experimental techniques at various length scales using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, nanoindentation, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and swelling and swelling pressure response obtained using a specifically designed controlled swelling cell provide verification as well as guide modelling. These unique and essential experimental and modelling interconnects allow for accurate bridging of length scales. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to arrive at a {{fundamental}} understanding of kimberlite weathering and of factors which affect the rate and extent of weathering. Weathering was evaluated by measuring the change in size distribution after immersing crushed kimberlite in solutions of various compositions. Reproducibility of the measurements was found to be good, with the cumulative mass passing a given size differing by 7 % or less, as tested for various weathering conditions. Kimberlite mineralogy, specifically the <b>swelling</b> <b>clay</b> content, was found to play a central role: kimberlite ores containing no <b>swelling</b> <b>clay</b> were not prone to weathering under any of the conditions tested. The cation exchange capacity (CEC) correlates well with the <b>swelling</b> <b>clay</b> content and with the weathering behaviour. The cation exchange capacity may be used in conjunction with the <b>swelling</b> <b>clay</b> content, as a predictor of possible kimberlite behaviour; however, given the relative complexity and cost of measuring <b>swelling</b> <b>clay</b> content (by X-ray diffraction), the CEC is the preferred parameter for practical use. Cations in the weathering solution have a strong effect on kimberlite weathering; the strength of the effect followed the series Cu 2 + > Li+ > Fe 2 + > Ca 2 + > Fe 3 + > Mg 2 +, whereas K+ and NH 4 + stabilised the kimberlite somewhat against weathering. This sequence was in reasonable correlation with the ionic potential (ratio of valency to ionic radius), but with exceptionally strong weathering effects of Cu 2 +, and (to a lesser extent) of Li+ and Fe 2 +. The strong effect of the latter group of cations may be related to their tendency to adsorb onto other crystal sites in addition to the interlayer – the associated change in surface energy can change the fracture behaviour of the kimberlite. Measurement of the layer spacing of the <b>swelling</b> <b>clay</b> (by X-ray diffraction) showed no correlation between the weathering effect of a cation and the associated thickness of the interlayer. For solutions of cupric ions, the identity of the anion (chloride or sulphate) has little effect on weathering. The size of the crushed kimberlite ore similarly has little effect on the relative extent of size degradation by weathering. The concentration of cupric ions affects weathering, as does the weathering time – although 85 % of the weathering caused by 30 days' exposure was found to occur within the first 24 hours. Increasing the temperature to 40 °C (in a magnesium chloride solution) also increased weathering strongly. The kinetics of exchange of cuprous and potassium ions was measured (for two different kimberlites); the apparent reaction order (with respect to the concentration of exchanging cations in solution) varied between 1 and 3. 5, and exchange of potassium was more rapid. This work has practical implications for in-plant processing of kimberlite, possible alternative kimberlite processing routes which eliminate one or more crushing steps, and for the stability of mine tunnels which pass through kimberlite.

40|$|International audienceThe {{understanding}} of the adsorption of charged species in <b>swelling</b> <b>clays</b> is of primary importance to optimise the capture of heavy metal ions in soils. Adsorption is expected {{to depend on the}} microscopic structure of the clay, which varies strongly with the origin and history (hydration-desorption cycles, temperature [...] .) of the sample. Then it is necessary to evaluate the distinct interaction energies between water molecules, interlayer cations and clay surfaces, taking into account the position of the substitutions in the clay layer. Here we propose an investigation of plausible structures of some Pb-montmorillonites differing by their interlayer distances, their layer charges and the distribution of substitutions in octahedral sheet from a modelling approach, looking at the evolution of the partial charges in these structures. Using a methodology previously developed in the simpler case of alkali cations, we also estimate the surface energy in the dry state and then the details of the hydration energy for the cation and for the clay layer to interpret the capacity of ion adsorption in <b>swelling</b> <b>clays</b> to capture heavy metals. We conclude from our calculations that a cell structure with intermediate layer charge (close to 0. 5 per unit cell) is probably the best candidate to allow the capture of the Pb 2 + as interlayer cations considering the electrostatic effect. The hydration process of the cation appears as the most energetic part of the hydration of <b>swelling</b> <b>clays</b> compared to the interactions with the layer, but the cation mobility is limited since the hydration process is not complete. This means that the heavy metal ions, present in the interlayer space, will be unable to diffuse and will be captured {{in the case of a}} low layer charge...|$|R

40|$|This master thesis aims {{to provide}} insight and {{qualitative}} information about swelling mechanisms in volcanic rocks, {{in particular the}} swelling of rocks related to hydropower water tunnels. Additionally, traditional laboratory methods for determining the main rock material properties controlling swelling behavior are investigated. The rock samples tested are obtained from the Alimit area in Philippines, where The Alimit HEPP is in its feasibility phase. The hope is to provide an enhanced understanding of the swelling potential of the volcanic rocks, and introduce a suggestion on a proper investigation procedure to detect potential challenges at an early stage. The first step in this investigation, was to get {{an overview of the}} status quo in swelling rock sciences. The further work was based on the leading hypothesis on <b>swelling</b> <b>clay</b> minerals (i. e. smectites or similar groups of <b>swelling</b> <b>clay</b> minerals) to be the main cause of tunnel collapses in previous projects. Other explanations, as the swelling of chlorites and zeolites, and moisture swelling, were also kept in mind during the investigations. The next step was to survey the project case site, located in the Ifugao province of the Philippines, to get an overview of the geological and topographical features of the area. Sampling of the assumed most dominating rock types, with focus on regions in which major constructions are planned, was performed. The samples were obtained from the borehole core storage of SN Aboitiz (cooperating partner of SN Power/Statkraft) in Lagawe, Philippines. The main part of the investigation procedure was to obtain information on rock material key properties of the collected samples, by different laboratory test methods. The samples underwent mineralogical analyses, UCS-tests, and different types of swelling tests. Oedometer swelling tests were performed at two different institutes (NTNU and KiT), for comparison of methodology and output. The study has uncovered an unexpected swelling potential of strong, andesitic rock types, despite the lack of <b>swelling</b> <b>clay</b> minerals in the samples tested. The swelling pressure magnitudes are confirmed by repeated tests, and apply on the results obtained at both institutes. The swelling potential is assumed closely linked to the high content of laumontite (zeolite). Content of <b>swelling</b> <b>clay</b> minerals, in particular montmorillonite, ii is detected in other rock types tested. The rock material of these samples are weak and disintegrated, and thus not up to standards for UCS testing. However, the swelling pressure magnitudes are lower in the weak material, compared to the strong andesitic rock. The comparison of the oedometer methodology in operation at NTNU and KiT, uncovered important differences between the two institutes. The deviations apply on both the apparatus used, and the procedures of swelling tests. The differences include the version of the ISRM suggested methods, intern modifications on apparatus and procedures, and intern traditions in how specific points in the ISRM standard is translated in practice.
