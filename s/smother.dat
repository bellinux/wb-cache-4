5|$|Atkins {{was arrested}} in November 2011 for {{allegedly}} trying to <b>smother</b> his wife with a pillow, while his 10-year-old son watched. He was released on $2,500 bail three hours after the arrest, and was ordered by the Williamson County, Tennessee court to take an anger assessment which found no need for any further action. The altercation was disputed by Atkins' lawyer, who stated that it was purely verbal. Atkins filed for divorce within 24 hours of the alleged assault. The divorce was settled in late-September 2012. In February 2012, Atkins was cleared of the domestic assault charge.|$|E
5|$|Coral {{reefs and}} shallow marine environments are threatened, {{not only by}} natural events and {{increased}} sea temperatures, but also by such man-made problems as pollution, sedimentation and destructive fishing practices.

These may directly kill or injure marine life, or may encourage the growth of algae that <b>smother</b> native species, or form algal blooms with wide-ranging effects.

5|$|The French {{would use}} the lessons learned at Muong Khoua {{and those of the}} 1952 Battle of Na San in their defence plans at Điện Biên Phủ, while the Viet Minh in turn would employ similar tactics of encirclement and {{strangulation}} there. The importance of an air bridge to maintain supply lines, strong artillery support to stave off human-wave Viet Minh attacks, and the need for isolated emplacements to mutually support each other, were also important tactics taken on board by the French from both conflicts. The disappearance of local civiliain populations previously friendly towards the French, which served as a precursor to Viet Minh attack, was also remembered by the Điện Biên Phủ troops. For the Viet Minh, their abilities to isolated and <b>smother</b> individual strongpoints while maintaining hidden artillery and support weapon emplacements {{out of the reach of}} French airstrikes and artillery were honed at both battles, as were their practicies of using human-wave attacks.|$|E

5|$|Drunken Angel {{is often}} {{considered}} the director's first major work. Although the script, {{like all of}} Kurosawa's occupation-era works, {{had to go through}} forced rewrites due to American censorship, Kurosawa felt that this was the first film in which he was able to express himself freely. A grittily realistic story of a doctor who tries to save a gangster (yakuza) with tuberculosis, it was also the director's first film with Toshiro Mifune, who would proceed to play either the main or a major character in all but one (Ikiru) of the director's next 16 films. While Mifune was not cast as the protagonist in Drunken Angel, his explosive performance as the gangster so dominates the drama that he shifted the focus from the title character, the alcoholic doctor played by Takashi Shimura, who had already appeared in several Kurosawa movies. However, Kurosawa did not want to <b>smother</b> the young actor's immense vitality, and Mifune's rebellious character electrified audiences in much the way that Marlon Brando's defiant stance would startle American film audiences a few years later. The film premiered in Tokyo in April 1948 to rave reviews and was chosen by the prestigious Kinema Junpo critics poll as the best film of its year, the first of three Kurosawa movies to be so honored.|$|E

50|$|<b>Smothering</b> is the {{mechanical}} obstruction {{of the flow}} of air from the environment into the mouth and/or nostrils, for instance, by covering the mouth and nose with a hand, pillow, or a plastic bag. <b>Smothering</b> can be either partial or complete, where partial indicates that the person being <b>smothered</b> is able to inhale some air, although less than required. In a normal situation, <b>smothering</b> requires at least partial obstruction of both the nasal cavities and the mouth to lead to asphyxia. <b>Smothering</b> with the hands or chest is used in some combat sports to distract the opponent, and create openings for transitions, as the opponent is forced to react to the <b>smothering.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Thugs was a tag {{team that}} {{consisted}} of [...] "The Dirty White Boy" [...] Tony Anthony and Tracy <b>Smothers.</b> The duo first wrestled as a tag team on March 23, 1995 where Dirty White Boy acted as Smothers' partner in a tag team match against The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed) during Smothers' feud with Gangstas. In those days, Boo Bradley was the partner of Tracy <b>Smothers</b> but Dirty White Boy would occasionally team with <b>Smothers</b> against Gangstas. Dirty White Boy and <b>Smothers</b> went on to lose the match. The next day, on March 24, Dirty White Boy replaced Boo Bradley in a tag team match where <b>Smothers</b> and Bradley took on The Gangstas but just got pinned. Dirty White Boy and Tracy <b>Smothers</b> would not team up together for two shows in March because <b>Smothers</b> and Bradley feuded with Gangstas while Dirty White Boy feuded with Buddy Landel.|$|R

25|$|Tackling is {{the only}} way to stop a player from running and is a major part of any team's defence. A good tackle stops the player from moving forward and {{prevents}} them from passing the ball. It can also put an opponent under pressure and force the ball loose. There are five styles of tackles commonly used by players: the side, rear, passive front, active front and <b>smother.</b> The aim of the active front tackle is to drive the opponent backwards, while the <b>smother</b> tackle prevents the opposing player passing the ball. Once the player has been brought to ground, the tackler typically tries to get to their feet quickly and compete for the ball. Other players arriving at the tackle will also compete for the ball.|$|E

25|$|Reefs are chronically {{at risk of}} algal encroachment. Overfishing {{and excess}} {{nutrient}} supply from onshore can enable algae to outcompete and kill the coral. Increased nutrient levels can {{be a result of}} sewage or chemical fertilizer runoff from nearby coastal developments. Runoff can carry nitrogen and phosphorus which promote excess algae growth. Algae can sometimes out-compete the coral for space. The algae can then <b>smother</b> the coral by decreasing the oxygen supply available to the reef. Decreased oxygen levels can slow down coral's calcification rates weakening the coral and leaving it more susceptible to disease and degradation. In surveys done around largely uninhabited US Pacific islands, algae inhabit a large percentage of surveyed coral locations. The algal population consists of turf algae, coralline algae, and macro algae.|$|E
