5|$|Despite {{being the}} better {{team for the}} {{majority}} of the match, Liverpool were unable to beat the Independiente defence, with their shooting in front of goal being the culprit. Both sides questioned some of the referee's decisions. Liverpool believed they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> two penalties, while Independiente felt that the assistant referee's decisions were questionable. Incidentally, the referee had served half of his two match ban handed out by the Brazilian Football Association.|$|E
5|$|Two polls {{conducted}} {{shortly after}} Schiavo's feeding tube was removed {{for the final}} time in 2005 showed that {{a large majority of}} Americans believed that Michael Schiavo <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the authority to make decisions on behalf of his wife, Terri, and that the United States Congress overstepped its bounds with its intervention in the case. However, other polls seemed to favor the Schindler family's position, and questions were raised about the wording of all the polls.|$|E
5|$|Jones was {{not alone}} in his wish to get more screen time; the writers, who were reading Internet forums and {{receiving}} mail from the audience that requested the same thing, decided that Pete would learn Clark's secret in season two. The creative team hoped that knowing Clark's secret would allow the character to be written into more scenes, and become involved on a daily basis with the Kent family. Ultimately, Pete's primary story arc in season three became the character's inability to deal with knowing Clark's secret, and his growing feeling of abandonment from Clark, who was spending more time with Chloe, Lana and Lex. Millar explains that they felt that the character was being wasted on Smallville, and that led to the decision of writing the character off the show with the hope that he could come back in future episodes. There was dissension between the cast and crew over Jones's departure. According to Annette O'Toole (Martha Kent), Clark needs a guy friend in his life, and she feels that the Kents would have taken Pete in when his parents left Smallville. Though Gough does not disagree that writing out Pete Ross was the best thing, he does feel that his exit could have gone better. According to Gough, Pete's departure felt rushed, and seemed to lack the importance that it <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had.</b>|$|E

5|$|Moyer, who {{had never}} argued before the Supreme Court, {{continued}} to represent Jacobson (who was in the audience). In his brief and at oral argument, he said that a mere stated interest in sex among young men did not rise {{to a level of}} proving predisposition, that the government <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> evidence in hand that Jacobson was actually willing to break the law to do so. (Kenneth Starr, then Solicitor General, had maintained in the government's brief opposing certiorari that his prior purchase of the Bare Boys magazines was all the proof it needed, even if the action were legal at the time.) Pressed on other undercover investigative techniques, he admitted that a government-run pawn shop would be a permissible way to apprehend thieves despite a lack of evidence of predisposition because the crimes might well have occurred prior to any contact with the government or its operatives.|$|E
5|$|To {{bring these}} areas to life, the level {{designers}} produced game mechanic elements using simple room layouts and shapes, while concept artists worked in tandem to create artwork for each location, following the art direction. Environment artists would then build 3D layouts {{based on those}} designs. Finding an appropriate color palette for the game world was difficult; browns and monochromatic colors could depict the desired dark and moody atmosphere, but the developers wanted the aesthetic to resemble the vibrant color schemes of a comic book. To this end, they used saturated colors for in-game lighting. Lighting was {{an important component of}} the game, being used to highlight points of interest and to draw the player onward in otherwise boring corridors. To maintain the intended level of detail and allow the game's console versions to fit into the devices' memory, each area had to be streamed in and out of memory seamlessly to free up memory for textures and geometry. All of the cutscenes were storyboarded by Rocksteady artists, being visualized in the game engine before the character performances were motion-captured. The design team decided that cutscenes should be used to advance character relationships, and that after each cutscene the player <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> their goal changed or the importance of their actions modified. Priority was given to keeping action scenes under the player's control rather than showing them in cutscenes.|$|E
25|$|Cutting a leg-break {{is always}} dangerous, and cutting Wright {{is a form}} of suicide.

It is one of the toughest problems of captaincy to know when to remove a man like that from the firing -line.|$|E

25|$|During {{the casting}} process of Stargate SG-1, the {{producers}} {{were looking for}} an actress who could portray a strong woman whom the audience would accept as a soldier. The character <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> combat training and have been in wars, but should also be a brilliant scientist and a beautiful woman. Amanda Tapping at first assumed that the show would put more emphasis on intellect, but {{found that it was}} an action-adventure scifi show where the characters often got physical. Tapping described Carter as a cross between Jack O'Neill and Daniel Jackson, and the conflict of her character whether to go the scientific route or with military protocol.|$|E
25|$|The {{international}} break left Middlesbrough without Tuncay and Shawky after both {{picked up}} injuries, while David Wheater could only make the bench after suffering from tonsillitis, so Digard, Riggott and Mido came in. Nathan Porritt was named {{as a substitute}} {{for the first time on}} an all-Academy bench. Portsmouth were the more dominant side throughout the match, however it was Boro who took the lead after Mido's fourth goal of the season. Jermain Defoe scored a brace for the home side in the second half to give them a 2–1 win. Digard picked up an injury and had to be taken off while Boro thought they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a penalty after Downing was brought down in the box.|$|E
25|$|Opinion polls at {{the time}} of Corby's arrest in 2004 found that most Australians {{believed}} her to be innocent. Subsequently, an ACNielsen poll published in June 2005, a week after the verdict, found that opinion was divided whether Corby was guilty but there was a perception that the trial had not been carried out fairly. A Morgan poll at the same time found that 51 per cent of Australians believed she was not guilty. However, an August 2010 Nielsen poll found that 1 in 10 respondents believed Corby to be innocent, 41 per cent thought she was guilty, and 48 per cent did not know. Forty per cent of Australians believed Corby <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> her 20-year prison sentence reduced.|$|E

25|$|On 21 November 1492, off {{the coast}} of Cuba, Pinzón failed to follow a direct order of Columbus to change course. He {{probably}} sailed off on his own trying to make individual discoveries and to find treasure, although Cesáreo Fernández Duro argues that the initial separation may have been accidental, a matter of missed signals. (Asensio takes Fernández Duro strongly to task for not adequately explaining the length of the separation; Fernández Duro responds that Pinzón simply continued the prior course, and if Columbus wanted, he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a pretty fair idea where to find him over the next several days.) During his separate travels he discovered new land; while all of the island geography of the first voyage is open to question, it is believed that the land was Haiti.|$|E
25|$|French and {{his staff}} {{believed}} that the Cavalry Division had been completely destroyed at Le Cateau (it had in fact suffered no more than 15 casualties) and that 5th Division had lost nearly all its guns, destroying II Corps as a fighting unit (in fact units reassembled after the retreat). French later (30 April 1915) told Haig that he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> Smith-Dorrien court-martialled after Le Cateau. In his memoirs French later claimed that Smith-Dorrien had risked destruction of his corps and lost 14,000 men and 80 guns (actual losses of each were around half of this number). However, {{it has also been}} argued that the vigorous defensive action at Le Cateau relieved the pressure and allowed the troops to re-organise, gather up their supplies, and make a fighting withdrawal.|$|E
25|$|He had bowled well to a {{supportive}} audience, and <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> Michael Clarke late {{on in the}} first day but the appeal was turned down. He went on to take the wicket of Australian keeper Brad Haddin. In his second innings Harmison made 19 no out off 28 balls but could not prevent the Australians from totalling 445 and proceeding to an innings victory. Harmison went on {{to play in the}} 5th Test at the Oval; {{on the final day of}} the series, Harmison claimed the three penultimate wickets to fall, including those of Peter Siddle and Stuart Clark with consecutive deliveries, both caught after attempting to play to the leg side, to create a unique opportunity to win the Ashes with a hat-trick (Ben Hilfenhaus successfully blocked the hat-trick ball). England won by 197 runs to take the series 2–1.|$|E

25|$|The {{geographic}} {{panorama of}} the {{developments of the}} new biology was conditioned above all by preceding work. The US, where genetics had developed the most rapidly, and the UK, {{where there was a}} coexistence of both genetics and biochemical research of highly advanced levels, were in the avant-garde. Germany, the cradle of the revolutions in physics, with the best minds and the most advanced laboratories of genetics in the world, <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a primary {{role in the development of}} molecular biology. But history decided differently: the arrival of the Nazis in 1933 - and, to a less extreme degree, the rigidification of totalitarian measures in fascist Italy - caused the emigration of a large number of Jewish and non-Jewish scientists. The majority of them fled to the US or the UK, providing an extra impulse to the scientific dynamism of those nations. These movements ultimately made molecular biology a truly international science from the very beginnings.|$|E
25|$|Crick and Watson {{felt that}} they had benefited from collaborating with Wilkins. They offered him a co-authorship on the article that first {{described}} the double helix structure of DNA. Wilkins turned down the offer, a fact that may have led to the terse character of the acknowledgment of experimental work done at King's College in the eventual published paper. Rather than make any of the DNA researchers at King's College co-authors on the Watson and Crick double helix article, the solution that was arrived at was to publish two additional papers from King's College along with the helix paper. Brenda Maddox suggests that because of the importance of her experimental results in Watson and Crick's model building and theoretical analysis, Franklin <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> her name on the original Watson and Crick paper in Nature. Franklin and Gosling submitted their own joint 'second' paper to Nature {{at the same time as}} Wilkins, Stokes, and Wilson submitted theirs (i.e. the 'third' paper on DNA).|$|E
25|$|The 1970-71 Australians lost 2-0 to the touring England {{team in the}} 1970-71 Ashes series. Australia had {{not lost}} a home Test series since 1954-55, but had {{suffered}} a heavy 4-0 defeat in South Africa in 1969-70 which had affected their confidence. On paper they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a good team, and E.W. Swanton reckoned they were favourites {{to hold on to}} The Ashes, but Rod Marsh, Dennis Lillee and Greg Chappell had yet to mature and Bill Lawry, Garth McKenzie and John Gleeson were {{at the end of their}} careers. In more fortunate circumstances the senior players could have eased the newcomers into the team, but Ray Illingworth was a captain who exploited every weakness and they did not get the chance. Their cause was not helped by the selectors Sir Donald Bradman, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey who chose nineteen different players in the series, nine of them debutants, and continuously chopped and changed the team which did not allow it to settle.|$|E

25|$|A rare lunchtime {{kick-off}} was {{the scene}} of Napoli's visit to the Tardini, just the second home game the Crociati had had in a run of seven. Napoli had won four in a row before this game, but they were dominated by an impressive Parma performance. Gianluca Musacci, however, appear to have tripped Edison Cavani in the penalty area late on in the second half, although replays suggested that Cavani tripped over his feet. He picked himself up to take the penalty, had it saved by Mirante, but was quickest to react to poke it home to give Napoli the lead. The parallels with last week's penalty against Genoa were strong: the referee's decision was questionable and Mirante saved, but could only push it into the taker's path. Parma continued to dominate in the second half and <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a penalty for an Andrea Dossena handball, but eventually scored through Cristian Zaccardo's tap-in with not long left to go. As Parma pressed for the winner, Napoli broke and Ezequiel Lavezzi scored, although replays suggest he was offside.|$|E
25|$|Apart of {{the court}} order, NBC News also {{reported}} one former Penn State assistant coach witnessed an incident in the late 1970s, and three other coaches —who {{have gone on to}} work in pro level and other colleges— allegedly saw inappropriate conduct between Sandusky and boys in the early and mid-1990s. Risk management expert Raymond Williams identified both the three incidents with some of the assistant coaches on the Penn State staff at the time, and three others that were reported to university officials; and whether key university officials <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> knowledge about child sex-assault allegations involving Sandusky in each of the six different cases dating to 1976. Mike McQueary claimed former fellow Penn State assistant coaches Greg Schiano and Tom Bradley also knew about Sandusky’s transgressions in a key testimony in a deposition among the documents related to the insurance coverage case, in which he claims that when he told Bradley about what he had seen, Bradley was not shocked, and that Bradley went on to tell him a story about a time Schiano had witnessed Sandusky abusing a child some time during the ‘90s. Both of the former Penn State assistants have denied McQueary's testimony.|$|E
25|$|Parma {{opened the}} last Serie A weekend of February away to Genoa, who {{were led by}} Pasquale Marino, the coach who took charge of much of Parma's 2010–11 season. With neither side having scored since 5 February, it was a {{surprise}} when the scoring was opened so easrly in the game; Massimo Gobbi swept home {{from the edge of the}} area after just five minutes. Giovinco then had what looked like a fair goal ruled out for offside just before half-time. Parma did get their second goal after the break after a brilliant run from Jonathan Biabiany ended in a Giovinco chance with the follow-up falling to Sergio Floccari, who converted against his former employees. With just over ten minutes to go, Genoa were very fortunate to be given a penalty for Francesco Modesto's accidental handball inside the area; Rodrigo Palacio tapped in after Mirante's save. Genoa then <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a penalty after a reckless Modesto challenged went unpunished. The referee inexplicably allowed 7 minutes of injury time; Palacio used the sixth to break the offside trap and slot home to level the score and earn a point for his team.|$|E
