5000|$|The alien base is {{centered}} on a structure called the [...] "Overmind", which is needed for their other <b>structures</b> <b>to</b> function and new <b>structures</b> <b>to</b> be built. Unlike the Human team structures, aliens may build on walls and ceilings to tactically build. Eggs provide a creep which allows nearby alien <b>structures</b> <b>to</b> live and be built, allowing for aliens to easily build offensive forward bases. Without a creep, alien structures will self destruct.|$|R

The fuselage plating was 24, 20 and 18 gauge in order of thickness towards the tail, while the fin structure was completed using short longerons from frames 20 to 23, before being covered in 22 gauge plating.|$|E
5|$|After {{his death}} from cancer in 1941 his manuscripts were curated by his {{linguist}} friends who also worked {{to spread the}} influence of Whorf's ideas on the relation between language, culture and cognition. Many of his works were published posthumously in the first decades after his death. In the 1960s Whorf's views fell out of favor and he {{became the subject of}} harsh criticisms by scholars who considered language <b>structure</b> <b>to</b> primarily reflect cognitive universals rather than cultural differences. Critics argued that Whorf's ideas were untestable and poorly formulated and that they were based on badly analyzed or misunderstood data.|$|E
5|$|As enzymes {{have evolved}} to bind their {{substrates}} tightly, and most reversible inhibitors bind in the active site of enzymes, it is unsurprising {{that some of these}} inhibitors are strikingly similar in <b>structure</b> <b>to</b> the substrates of their targets. An example of these substrate mimics are the protease inhibitors, a very successful class of antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV. The structure of ritonavir, a protease inhibitor based on a peptide and containing three peptide bonds, is shown on the right. As this drug resembles the protein that is the substrate of the HIV protease, it competes with this substrate in the enzyme's active site.|$|E
