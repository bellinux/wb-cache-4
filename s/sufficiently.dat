5|$|Argon is the {{cheapest}} alternative when nitrogen is not <b>sufficiently</b> inert.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislative}} objective must be <b>sufficiently</b> important to justify limiting the fundamental right.|$|E
5|$|Adult plumage <b>sufficiently</b> {{developed}} and fixed following the juvenile years {{such that it}} no longer changes significantly in appearance with age.|$|E
5|$|Also, fledging. The {{stage in}} a young bird's life when the {{feathers}} and wing muscles are <b>sufficiently</b> developed for flight, or the act of a chick's parents in raising it to that time threshold.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is a <b>sufficiently</b> {{successful}} {{strategy to}} have had significant effects {{on the evolution of}} both aposematic and non-aposematic species.|$|E
5|$|Arctic terns usually migrate <b>sufficiently</b> far {{offshore}} {{that they}} are rarely seen from land outside the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Both {{weapons were}} to be <b>sufficiently</b> compact to be carried {{hands-free}} on the user's person at all times, whether in the cab of a vehicle or the cockpit of an aircraft, and were to perform effectively in all environments and weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|Brock University in Ontario {{provides}} {{scholarships to}} Guernsey students who achieve <b>sufficiently</b> high grades. In 1969, the Guernsey Post Office issued postage stamps to commemorate {{his life and}} achievements.|$|E
5|$|However, other taxonomists {{believe that}} some {{patterns}} of characteristics are <b>sufficiently</b> stable to make higher-level classifications worthwhile, although there are different views about what the higher-level classifications should be.|$|E
5|$|In the UK in 2007, {{they were}} {{formally}} {{removed from the}} Rare Breeds Survival Trust's watch list, having recovered <b>sufficiently</b> from the devastation of the foot and mouth crisis of the early 2000s, to have exceeded 1500 registered breeding females.|$|E
5|$|Peckinpaugh succeeded Harris as GM for the Buffalo Bisons of the International League in the 1946–47 offseason. He {{was fired}} after the 1947 season, as the team's {{directors}} felt Peckinpaugh didn't <b>sufficiently</b> develop a farm system.|$|E
5|$|Sir Thursday– Sir Thursday is {{the fourth}} Trustee of the Will, and is afflicted with the sin of Wrath. He is a {{military}} Denizen, and believes in order and control. The Will breaks free from him when Arthur makes him <b>sufficiently</b> angry.|$|E
5|$|Some mimicry is imperfect. Natural {{selection}} drives mimicry only {{far enough}} to deceive predators. For example, when predators avoid a mimic that imperfectly resembles a coral snake, the mimic is <b>sufficiently</b> protected.|$|E
5|$|Swifts {{spend most}} of their time in flight. Few birds have the {{necessary}} speed and agility to catch them, hobbies being the main exception. The nest sites are also usually <b>sufficiently</b> inaccessible to be beyond the reach of snakes or mammalian predators.|$|E
5|$|The Golden Tornado then invaded North Carolina for {{the first}} time and beat the Tar Heels 20–7. Georgia Tech started the game with its second stringers, which seemed to perform <b>sufficiently.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Hardy–Weinberg {{principle}} {{states that}} within <b>sufficiently</b> large populations, the allele frequencies remain constant {{from one generation}} to the next unless the equilibrium is disturbed by migration, genetic mutations, or selection.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} alcohol on bees are <b>sufficiently</b> {{similar to the}} effects of alcohol on humans that honey bees have been used as models of human ethanol intoxication. However, the {{metabolism}} of bees and humans is <b>sufficiently</b> different that bees can safely collect nectars from plants that contain compounds toxic to humans. The honey produced by bees from these toxic nectars can be poisonous if consumed by humans. Many humans have eaten toxic honey and become seriously ill as a result.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} ergodic theory {{is the study}} of the {{long-term}} behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. The protypical case of a field that ergodic theory applies to is thermodynamics, in which—though the microscopic state of a system is extremely complicated (it is impossible to understand the ensemble of individual collisions between particles of matter)—the average behavior over <b>sufficiently</b> long time intervals is tractable. The laws of thermodynamics are assertions about such average behavior. In particular, one formulation of the zeroth law of thermodynamics asserts that over <b>sufficiently</b> long timescales, the only functionally independent measurement that one can make of a thermodynamic system in equilibrium is its total energy, in the form of temperature.|$|E
5|$|The {{intuitive}} {{notion that}} each natural number {{can be obtained}} by applying successor <b>sufficiently</b> often to zero requires an additional axiom, which is sometimes called the axiom of induction.|$|E
5|$|The partial sums (the Taylor polynomials) of {{the series}} {{can be used as}} approximations of the entire function. These approximations are good if <b>sufficiently</b> many terms are included.|$|E
5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a <b>sufficiently</b> heavy weight holding the rope {{approximately}} vertical. The shot line float should be <b>sufficiently</b> buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. As divers are seldom weighted to be very negatively buoyant, a positive buoyancy of 50kg is considered adequate by some authorities for general commercial use. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy ay their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, prey animals {{might be}} <b>sufficiently</b> gregarious to form {{clusters}} tight enough {{to enhance the}} warning signal. If the species was already unpalatable, predators might learn to avoid the cluster, protecting gregarious individuals with the new aposematic trait. Gregariousness would assist predators to learn to avoid unpalatable, gregarious prey. Aposematism could also be favoured in dense populations even if these are not gregarious.|$|E
5|$|Among {{many other}} things, he gave {{accurate}} {{descriptions of the}} four-chambered stomachs of ruminants, and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the dogfish. His accounts of about 35 animals are <b>sufficiently</b> detailed to convince biologists that he dissected those species, indeed vivisecting some; he mentions the internal anatomy of roughly 110 animals in total.|$|E
5|$|Aside from fossils clearly {{belonging}} to Plateosaurus, {{there is much}} prosauropod material from the German Knollenmergel in museum collections, most of it labeled as Plateosaurus, that {{does not belong to}} the type species and possibly not to Plateosaurus at all. Some of this material is not diagnostic; other material has been recognized to be different, but was never <b>sufficiently</b> described.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes are {{territorial}} on {{the breeding}} grounds, with distinctive threat displays, but are more gregarious during migration and in wintering areas. Pairs {{stay in their}} territory throughout the year where the climate is <b>sufficiently</b> temperate. This common and conspicuous species {{has given rise to}} a number of literary and cultural references, frequently related to its song.|$|E
5|$|By September 1943, {{the values}} of the D-D and T-D had been revised upwards, raising hopes that a fusion {{reaction}} could be started at lower temperatures. Teller was <b>sufficiently</b> optimistic about the Super, and <b>sufficiently</b> concerned about reports that the Germans were interested in deuterium, to ask the Governing Board to raise its priority. The board agreed to some extent, but ruled that only one person could be spared to work on it full-time. Oppenheimer designated Konopinski, who would {{spend the rest of the}} war working on it. Nonetheless, in February 1944, Teller added Stanislaw Ulam, Jane Roberg, Geoffrey Chew, and Harold and Mary Argo to his T-1 Group. Ulam calculated the inverse Compton cooling, while Roberg worked out the ignition temperature of T-D mixtures. Maria Goeppert joined the group in February 1945.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1944, {{his health}} had {{deteriorated}} {{to the extent}} that he was evacuated to Australia, and for a time was not expected to live. By early 1945 he had recovered <b>sufficiently</b> to be appointed to command the 6th Division. While flying to assume this new command, the RAAF Lockheed Hudson aircraft he was travelling in crashed into the sea, killing all on board.|$|E
5|$|Classifications {{published}} {{since the}} use of molecular phylogenetics have taken a narrower view of the Liliaceae (s.s.). In 1998, Tamura considered Calochortus <b>sufficiently</b> distinct to elevate the subfamily Calochortoideae to family status as Calochortaceae, resulting in the term Liliaceae sensu Tamura to indicate Liliaceae without the Calochortoideae. In 2009, Takhtajan used an even narrower definition (see Table 2 & Table 3 below).|$|E
5|$|Despite the disappointing way {{in which}} his playing career ended, Staunton {{continued}} to write with enthusiasm about the progress of new technologies, players and developments in chess theory. At {{the time of his}} death his last book, Chess: Theory and Practice, was <b>sufficiently</b> complete to be published posthumously in 1876, and it was described as up-to-date fourteen years after his death.|$|E
5|$|Each {{association}} was {{to cover a}} single county (corresponding to the lieutenancy counties created by the Local Government Act 1888, Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889 and Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898). Where the county was <b>sufficiently</b> large, the scheme could divide it into multiple parts and assign these to sub-associations.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Göring, {{commander-in-chief}} of the Luftwaffe sanctioned the operation. The Germans {{waited for}} an opportunity to begin the intruder operation and one presented itself {{on the night of the}} 3/4 March 1945 when Bomber Command attacked targets in western Germany. The operation failed to achieve the results hoped for; the successes of the attacking force were not <b>sufficiently</b> commensurate with the losses sustained.|$|E
5|$|His {{thinking}} threw {{light in}} a very introspective way on the entire process of the judicial function. His decisions, beyond just the vote they represented, were <b>sufficiently</b> philosophical to be of enduring interest. He decided the case before him with that respect for its particulars, its special features, that marks alike the honest artist and the just judge.|$|E
5|$|However, the Queen's Park project {{suffered}} serious mismanagement and fraud; {{the company}} secretary William Swindlehurst {{and two others}} were found guilty in 1877 of defrauding £9,312 (approximately £ today) from the project. The company was forced to raise rents, and tenants were no longer permitted to buy their houses; by 1880 the company's finances had recovered <b>sufficiently</b> to allow further expansion.|$|E
5|$|If {{the mass}} of a main-sequence star is between 0.5 and 8 , its core will become <b>sufficiently</b> hot to fuse helium into carbon and oxygen via the triple-alpha process, but it will never become <b>sufficiently</b> hot to fuse carbon into neon. Near {{the end of the}} period in which it {{undergoes}} fusion reactions, such a star will have a carbon–oxygen core which does not undergo fusion reactions, surrounded by an inner helium-burning shell and an outer hydrogen-burning shell. On the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, it will be found on the asymptotic giant branch. It will then expel most of its outer material, creating a planetary nebula, until only the carbon–oxygen core is left. This process is responsible for the carbon–oxygen white dwarfs which form the vast majority of observed white dwarfs.|$|E
5|$|In 1627, Johannes Kepler {{became the}} first person to predict a transit of Venus, by {{predicting}} the 1631 event. His methods were not <b>sufficiently</b> accurate to predict that the transit would not be visible in most of Europe, and as a consequence, nobody was able to use his prediction to observe the phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|In Dyson's {{original}} paper, he {{speculated that}} <b>sufficiently</b> advanced extraterrestrial civilizations would likely follow a similar power-consumption pattern {{to that of}} humans, and would eventually build their own sphere of collectors. Constructing such a system would make such a civilization a Type II Kardashev civilization.|$|E
