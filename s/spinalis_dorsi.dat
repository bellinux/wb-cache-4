25|$|The {{spine of}} a horse's back is {{supported}} by muscles, three ligaments, and abdominal muscles. The <b>Spinalis</b> <b>Dorsi</b> originates on the fourth cervical vertebra and inserts beneath the thoracic section of the Trapezius. The Longissimus dorsi originates from the last four cervical vertebrae, and courses along the spine, inserting eventually into the ilium and sacrum. This muscle contracts the spine and also raises and supports the head and neck, and is the main muscle used for rearing, kicking, jumping, and turning. It is the longest and strongest muscle in the body, and is the muscle the rider sits on. The Intercostal muscles begin at the spaces between the ribs and aid in breathing. The external and internal abdominal obliques {{are attached to the}} ribs and pelvic bones, and support the internal organs. The Supraspinous ligament begins at the poll and ends at the croup (sacral vertebrae). It supports the head and neck, and its traction force aids in supporting the weaker thoracic and lumbar areas. It spreads out and attaches to the spines of the cervical vertebrae. In the wither and neck area, it is called the nuchal ligament.|$|E

50|$|The spinalis is {{a portion}} of the erector spinae, a bundle of muscles and tendons, located nearest to the spine. It is divided into three parts: <b>Spinalis</b> <b>dorsi,</b> spinalis cervicis, and spinalis capitis.|$|E
5000|$|A {{slice of}} {{standing}} rib roast will include {{portions of the}} so-called [...] "eye" [...] of the rib, {{as well as the}} outer, fat-marbled muscle (<b>spinalis</b> <b>dorsi)</b> known as the [...] "lip" [...] or [...] "cap". The traditional preparation for a standing rib roast is to rub the outside of the roast with salt and seasonings and slow-roast with dry heat. It also may be grilled.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spinalis</b> <b>dorsi,</b> {{the medial}} {{continuation}} of the sacrospinalis, is scarcely separable as a distinct muscle. It is situated at the medial side of the longissimus dorsi, and is intimately blended with it; it arises by three or four tendons from the spinous processes {{of the first two}} lumbar and the last two thoracic vertebrae: these, uniting, form a small muscle which is inserted by separate tendons into the spinous processes of the upper thoracic vertebrae, the number varying from four to eight.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} several {{different}} hormonal growth promotant (HGP) implant strategies on the palatability and carcass traits of different muscles in beef carcasses was investigated using samples from heifer and steer carcasses from a Bos indicus composite breed. In experiment 1, {{there were seven}} different implant strategies evaluated in heifers that were given different combinations of up to three implants (implanted at weaning, during backgrounding and at feedlot entry). A total of 112 heifers were slaughtered and 11 muscles or portions were collected from both sides [Mm. adductor femoris, gracilus, semimembranosus, longissimus dorsi lumborum, triceps brachii caput longum, semispinalis capitis, serratus ventralis cervicis, <b>spinalis</b> <b>dorsi,</b> biceps femoris (syn. gluteobiceps), tensor fasciae latae, gluteus medius (both the ‘D’ and the ‘eye’ portions) rectus femoris, vastus intermedius, vastus lateralis and vastus medialis]. These muscles were used to prepare a total of 1030 sensory samples which were aged for either 7 or 21 days and frozen. Thawed samples were cooked using different cooking methods (grill, roast and stir frying) before being evaluated by a consumer taste panel that scored samples for tenderness, juiciness, like flavour and overall liking. Experiment 2 used the steer portion from the same calving, which were treated to a similar array of HGP strategies, except that they were given up to four implants between weaning and slaughter at 3 years of age. In experiment 2, there was a total of 12 different HGP implant strategies tested. At boning, three muscles (Mm. psoas major, longisimuss dorsi thoracis and lumborum portions) were collected from each of 79 carcasses {{with a total of}} 237 steak samples that consumers tested as grilled steaks. For both experiments, the mean of the HGP implant strategies resulted in increased ossification scores (P 0. 05), and aging rates differed among the muscles (P 0. 05...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Ribeye rolls and top blade roasts were fabricated from corresponding sides of twenty-four beef carcasses varying in USDA quality and yield grades. The kernel fat that lies between the <b>Spinalis</b> <b>dorsi</b> and the Longissimus thoracis was removed. The Infraspinatus was cut open and the heavy connective tissue removed. A 0. 5 % dry-sprinkle application of Activa[]TG-RM/sodium caseinate mixture was applied. Steaks from both the ribeye and the top blade were assigned randomly to: 1) in-home sensory evaluation; 2) raw chemical analysis; or 3) cooked chemical analysis. Both the raw and cooked steaks were dissected into separable lean, fat, connective tissue, and inseparable tissue. Chemical analyses were conducted to determine percent moisture, fat, and protein content, and results were determined for protein calories, fat calories, and total calories. In addition, twenty-four beef lip-on, ribeye rolls and twenty beef top blade roasts were used for a consumer retail case study. Results showed treatment affected percent dissectible lean, fat calories, and total calories for all cuts (P 0. 05) percent chemical moisture, fat, and protein of the cooked top blade steaks, and did not affect percent chemical moisture and fat for the raw top blade. In-home sensory evaluations showed that consumers rated Activa[] TG-RM formed steaks higher for leanness. However, treated ribeyes did not show a difference for color, overall appearance, tenderness, juiciness, flavor, and overall like/dislike. Consumers rated treated top blade steaks higher for all sensory characteristics. Consumer case study data suggested that consumers chose treated ribeyes over control ribeyes due to leanness, and treated top blade steaks over controls because of perceived marbling. Modifying retail cuts to remove excessive seam fat and connective tissue appears to be an effective tool in increasing the nutritional and purchasing characteristics of steaks...|$|E
40|$|Flavor lexicons {{are used}} in sensory {{evaluation}} to determine the flavor profile of a food product. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a flavor lexicon for cooked beef, which can then be used in various projects relating to beef quality such as studies investigating animal diet, marinating, ageing, or other enhancements. A descriptive panel of 10 people was used to develop a flavor lexicon of 18 attributes, including astringent, barny, bloody, brothy, browned, gamey, grassy, juicy, fatty, livery, metallic, oxidized, roast beef, and the five basic tastes (bitter, salty, sour, sweet, and umami). In contrast to other studies on beef, this lexicon was developed to include both positive and negative attributes. The lexicon was able to show that rib eye steaks from the Longissimus dorsi muscle in grass-fed animals were significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) higher in barny, bitter, gamey, and grassy flavors, and lower in juicy and umami flavors. The steaks were also rated by consumers, who showed a preference for grain-fed beef over grass-fed beef. The ratings of the descriptive panel were related to the consumer panel scores to equate the lexicon terms with a positive or negative consumer degree of liking score. Those terms that were considered positive in this study due to their positive correlation with consumer liking include brothy, umami, roast beef, juicy, browned, fatty, and salty. The terms that were inversely associated with consumer liking were barny, bitter, gamey and grassy, among others. A separate descriptive panel was conducted on the <b>Spinalis</b> <b>dorsi</b> (or “cap” muscle) of the rib eye steak, with similar results. Additionally, descriptive and consumer evaluations found no difference between two types of grass diets, namely alfalfa and sainfoin. Different mixtures of beef and chicken were also evaluated to determine flavor differences between the two meats. Chicken was found to be more closely correlated to brothy, juicy, sweet, and umami, among others, while beef was found to be more closely correlated to terms such as gamey, bloody, oxidized, metallic, roast beef, and astringent. Throughout these tests, the newly developed lexicon was shown to be an effective tool for profiling fresh meat samples...|$|E
