40|$|Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is {{fundamentally}} characterised by <b>social</b> <b>deficits.</b> It is thus {{important to understand}} social functioning and what contributes to social development in children on the spectrum. It is widely accepted that ASD has a neurobiological basis, however research on understanding the lack of social skills found in ASD individuals remains indefinite and controversial. In this thesis we explored attachment styles, parenting styles and ToM to discern how they relate to <b>social</b> <b>deficits</b> in ASD. The literature for typically developing children has illustrated important relationships however {{there is a lack}} of exploration in the ASD populace. This protocol was divided into two studies. Study 1 assessed <b>social</b> <b>deficits,</b> attachment and parenting styles in 46 children with ASD aged 4 – 14 years and included both verbal (n = 19) and non-verbal (n = 27) children. The ADOS- 2, Attachment Style Classification Questionnaire, and Parenting Style Dimension Questionnaire were used to measure these variables. Study 2 assessed ToM capacity and its relationship with parenting styles and <b>social</b> <b>deficits</b> in verbal children with ASD. In Study 1 we found verbal and non-verbal subgroups differed on <b>social</b> <b>deficits.</b> The aims for exploring attachment and parenting styles were to discern 1) what style dominates; 2) whether attachment and parenting styles differ between verbal and non-verbal children and 3) whether these variables relate to <b>social</b> <b>deficits.</b> We found odd patterns of attachment with no clear dominant style in our full sample. Only the non-verbal subgroup showed a relationship between secure attachment and reduced <b>social</b> <b>deficits.</b> In terms of parenting, the authoritative style was reported to be mostly employed by our parents and it related to reduced <b>social</b> <b>deficits</b> in both the full sample and the verbal subgroup. In Study 2 we explored 1) the extent of ToM deficits in ASD; 2) how parenting styles relate to ToM and 3) whether better ToM and parenting in combination related to reduced <b>social</b> <b>deficits.</b> We found severe ToM deficits in our sample which suggests delayed development. Authoritative parenting was significantly related to better ToM capacities. Furthermore, a regression of positive parenting and ToM abilities in combination with <b>social</b> <b>deficits</b> indicated that only ToM and age predicted less <b>social</b> <b>deficits.</b> This current study suggests that specifically authoritative parenting and ToM skills may be important underlying mechanisms for better social abilities in ASD. Most notably, it stresses that ASD cannot be regarded as a homogenous population as a clear distinction between the verbal and non-verbal subgroups is reported herein; a currently underestimated notion. Although still in its preliminary stages, the work reported in this thesis opens up a new line of thinking that could, in principle prove to be beneficial to research in the area of ASD...|$|R

40|$|Background: Infant crying is an {{important}} cue for mothers to respond adequately. Inappropriate response to infant crying can hinder social development in infants. In rodents, the pup-mother interaction largely depends on pup’s calls. Mouse pups emit high frequency to ultrasonic vocalization (2 – 90 kHz) to communicate with their dam for maternal care. However, {{little is known about}} how the maternal response to infant crying or pup calls affects social development over the long term. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we used mice lacking acid-sensing ion channel 3 (Asic 3 2 / 2) to create a hearing deficit to probe the effect of caregiver hearing on maternal care and adolescent social development. Female Asic 3 2 / 2 mice showed elevated hearing thresholds for low to ultrasonic frequency (4 – 32 kHz) on auditory brain stem response, which thus hindered their response to their pups ’ wriggling calls and ultrasonic vocalization, as well as their retrieval of pups. In adolescence, pups reared by Asic 3 2 / 2 mice showed a <b>social</b> <b>deficit</b> in juvenile social behaviors as compared with those reared by wild-type or heterozygous dams. The social-deficit phenotype in juvenile mice reared by Asic 3 2 / 2 mice was associated with the reduced serotonin transmission of the brain.

We investigated the behavioral effects of oxytocin in 13 subjects with autism. In a simulated ball game where participants interacted with fictitious partners, we found that after oxytocin inhalation, patients exhibited stronger interactions with the most socially cooperative partner and reported enhanced feelings of trust and preference. Also, during free viewing of pictures of faces, oxytocin selectively increased patients’ gazing time on the socially informative region of the face, namely the eyes. Thus, under oxytocin, patients respond more strongly to others and exhibit more appropriate social behavior and affect, suggesting a therapeutic potential of oxytocin through its action on a core dimension of autism...|$|E

This paper gives an overview of these social aspects using the NIMH Research and Domain Criteria ‘Systems for Social Processes’ as a framework.

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>deficits</b> are a core {{symptom of}} autism {{spectrum}} disorder; however, the perturbed neural mechanisms underpinning these deficits remain unclear. It {{has been suggested}} that social prediction errors—coding discrepancies between the predicted and actual outcome of another’s decisions—might {{play a crucial role in}} processing social information. While the gyral surface of the anterior cingulate cortex signalled social prediction errors in typically developing individuals, this crucial social signal was altered in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Importantly, the degree to which social prediction error signalling was aberrant correlated with diagnostic measures of <b>social</b> <b>deficits.</b> Effective connectivity analyses further revealed that, in typically developing individuals but not in autism spectrum disorder, the magnitude of social prediction errors was driven by input from the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

In this study, we investigated whether brexpiprazole could improve <b>social</b> recognition <b>deficits</b> (one of <b>social</b> cognition <b>deficits)</b> in mice, after administration of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK- 801 (dizocilpine). Dosing with dizocilpine (0. 1 mg/kg) induced significant impairment of social recognition in mice. Brexpiprazole (0. 01, 0. 03, 0. 1 mg/kg, p. o.) significantly ameliorated dizocilpine-induced <b>social</b> recognition <b>deficits,</b> without sedation or a reduction of exploratory behavior. In addition, brexpiprazole alone had no effect on social recognition in untreated control mice.

Using the methods of meta-analysis, this investigation explores the nature of <b>social</b> skill <b>deficits</b> among students with learning disabilities. Across 152 studies, quantitative synthesis shows that, on average, about 75 % of students with learning disabilities manifest <b>social</b> skill <b>deficits</b> that distinguish them from comparison samples. Approximately the same level of group differentiation is found across different raters (teachers, peers, self) and across most dimensions of social competence. Although <b>social</b> skill <b>deficits</b> appear to {{be an integral part of}} the learning disability experience, a number of questions about the relationship between learning disability and <b>social</b> skill <b>deficits</b> remain unanswered. Until these questions are answered, <b>social</b> skill <b>deficits</b> are best viewed as one among many elements of the learning disability constellation, and no significant definitional changes related to <b>social</b> skill <b>deficits</b> appear warranted.
