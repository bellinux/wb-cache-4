2500|$|If {{the aquifer}} is suitable, {{all of the}} {{associated}} infrastructure must be developed from scratch, increasing the development costs compared to depleted reservoirs.

Since the aquifer initially contains water {{there is little or}} no naturally occurring gas in the formation and of the gas injected <b>some</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> physically unrecoverable. As a result, aquifer storage typically requires significantly more cushion gas than depleted reservoirs; up to 80% of the total gas volume. Most aquifer storage facilities were developed when the price of natural gas was low, meaning this cushion gas was inexpensive to sacrifice. [...] With rising gas prices aquifer storage becomes more expensive to develop.|$|E
