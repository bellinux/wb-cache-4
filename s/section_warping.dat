The theoretical and numerical formulations to compute the cross <b>section</b> <b>warping</b> are presented and validated against axial displacements in a 3 D finite element model of a column. The global nonlinear response of a column under torsion is then computed using a multifiber beam model. Differences in global and local behavior between both models with and without warping show the importance of warping effect both in linear and nonlinear behavior...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a beam finite element {{for the long-term}} analysis of composite decks {{taking into account the}} warping of the slab cross section and the partial shear interaction between the slab and the girders. Slab shear-lag is taken into account by means of the product of a known function, describing the shape of the slab cross <b>section</b> <b>warping,</b> and an intensity function measuring the magnitude of warping along the beam axis. Time-dependent behaviour is considered by means of an integral-type visco-elastic creep law for the concrete. The numerical solution is obtained by means of the finite element method with a 13 -dof beam element and a step-by-step procedure for the evolution in time. The results of some applications show the accuracy and the capability of the proposed element...|$|E
40|$|Thin-walled {{rectangular}} section composite beams {{are built}} out of graphite-epoxy prepreg tape using an autoclave molding technique. Cantilevered beams are tested under static loads using a specially-built apparatus and bending slope and elastic twist at a station are measured using a laser system. Measured bending slope and bending-induced twist distributions are correlated with predicted results obtained using a simple beam analysis {{as well as a}} refined finite element analysis. Natural vibration characteristics at different rotational speeds are determined experimentally by testing beams in a specially built 10 ft diameter vacuum chamber. The rotor is excited by piezo-electric crystals and response is determined from strain gages mounted on the surface. For composite beams with bending-twisting couplings (symmetric layup), effects of <b>section</b> <b>warping</b> and transverse shear on structural response are found to be substantial. These results were substantiated by the analyses...|$|E

40|$|A dynamic {{simulation}} {{and test}} of frame with thin walled closed <b>section</b> beams considering <b>warping</b> conditions have been performed. When a beam is subjected under torsional moment, the cross section will deform an warping {{as well as}} twist. For some thin-walled <b>sections</b> <b>warping</b> will be large, and accompanying warping restraint will induce axial and shear stresses and reduce the twist of beam which stiffens the beam in torsion. This paper presents that an warping restraint factor in finite element model effects the behavior of beam deformation and dynamic mode shape. The computer modelling of frame is discussed in linear beam element model and linear thin shell element model, also presents a correlation between computer predicted and actual experimental results for static deflection, natural frequencies and mode shapes of frame.

40|$|A {{solution}} {{based on}} a variational procedure is presented {{for the assessment of}} the deformation of circular pipes subjected to radial loads along the surface or prescribed distortion along the edge. The transverse section deformation is approached with Fourier expansions, while for each trigonometric term an optimized x-variable function for the ovalization and transverse <b>section</b> <b>warping</b> is defined. To define a reliable and robust formulated solution, an adequate and realistic strain field was considered. This is based on the assumptions of the thin shell theory, where the shell radius is much larger than its thickness, and so allowing the definition of strains at the outer or inner shell surface simply identified by the addition of terms contributing with the thickness parameter, not changing the mean radius. The process of structural optimization is achieved solving a set of differential equations obtained after minimizing the shell strain energy, consequently allowing that the most accurate functions related to the displacement field are obtained. An analytic function is evaluated for the solution problem, including the determination of particular solutions when the system is non-homogeneous when surface loads are included. Examples with a radial load F imposed {{on the surface of the}} pipe or prescribed distortions will be analysed...|$|E
40|$|At {{preliminary}} design stage, the global mechanical behavior of large marine vessels such as container ships {{has previously been}} analyzed idealizing them as a classical beam. These structures are complex and a classical beam idealization significantly compromises important structural behavior associated with cross <b>section</b> <b>warping</b> or in-plane displacements. On the other hand, 3 D Finite Element (FE) models have been utilized which are accurate in capturing these details but pose high computational cost. In present work, structural analyses of marine vessels with realistic boundary conditions have been presented using well-known Carrera Unified Formulation (CUF). Using CUF, higher order theories can be implemented without the need of ad-hoc formulations. The finite element arrays are written in terms of fundamental nuclei for 1 D beam elements that are independent of problem characteristics and the approximation order. Thus, refined models can be developed in an automatic manner. In the present work, the beam cross sections are discretized using elements with Lagrange polynomials and the FE model is regarded as Component-Wise (CW), allowing one to model complex 3 D features, such as inclined hull walls, floors and girders {{in the form of}} components. The work is mainly divided in two parts: Hull in vacuo (in absence of water) and Hull with Hydrostatic Stiffness (in presence of water). The former involves static and dynamic structural analyses of hulls with realistic geometries without the effect of water. The later involves static and dynamic analyses of realistic hull geometries that are supported by buoyancy springs. The stiffness of buoyancy springs is made part of the fundamental nuclei and the corresponding FEM matrices for hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads are obtained. The hydrodynamic loads have been considered in the form of Radiation Wave loads which include damping and added mass effects. Utilization of Component-Wise (CW) model under hydrodynamic loads has afforded an ease in modelling the complex geometrical configurations such as realistic boat shapes and the dynamic response analyses of aircraft carrier due to moving aircraft. All the analyses have been validated with published literature and their computational efficacy is established through their comparison with the results from commercial code...|$|E

While they also weave patterns in the ley (supplementary warp) technique, they predominately embroider geometric shapes over plain weave backgrounds. Santa Cruz de Sallac is also well known for its revival of the watay (ikat) technique. In this dyeing technique, the weaver will prepare a special warp, {{where he or she}} tightly wraps up certain sections. The weaver then dyes this <b>warp.</b> The unwrapped <b>sections</b> of <b>warp</b> thread are dyed, but dye cannot enter the tightly wrapped sections which remain undyed.

Besides the Ccatcca district, Santa Cruz de Sallac is one of the only communities in Peru that still maintains the watay technique which can be traced to dyeing techniques practiced by the Nazca and Huari cultures.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the accuracy of}} using a one-dimensional analysis to predict frequencies of elastically-coupled highly-twisted rotor blades. Degrees of freedom associated with shear deformation are statically condensed from the formulation, so the analysis uses only those degrees of freedom associated with classical beam theory. The effects of cross <b>section</b> deformation (<b>warping)</b> are considered, and are shown to become significant for some types of elastic coupling. Improved results are demonstrated for highly-coupled blade structures through account of warping in a local cross section analysis, without explicit inclusion of these effects in the beam analysis.

40|$|A geometrically {{nonlinear}} {{theory is}} developed for spinning anisotropic beams having arbitrary cross sections. An assumed displacement field is developed using the standard 3 D kinematics relations {{to describe the}} global beam behavior supplemented with an additional field that represents the local deformation within the cross <b>section</b> and <b>warping</b> out of the cross section plane. It is assumed that {{the magnitude of this}} additional field is directly proportional to the local stress resultants.

This function plays the role of reducing the amount of free warping deformation throughout the field due to the restraint of the cross section(s) at the end(s) of the beam, e. g., in the case of a cantilever beam. Using a developed ordering scheme, the nonlinear strains are calculated to the third order. The FEM is developed using the weak form variational formulation. Preliminary interesting numerical results have been obtained that indicate the role of the restraining function in the case of a cantilever beam with circular cross section.
