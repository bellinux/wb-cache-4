5|$|Faced {{with one}} last push over {{mountains}} that {{were described as}} much worse than the Wasatch, the ragtag company had {{to decide whether to}} forge ahead or rest their cattle. It was October 20 and they had been told that the pass would not be snowed in until the middle of November. William Pike was killed when a gun being loaded by William Foster was discharged negligently, an event that <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the decision for them; family by family, they resumed their journey, first the Breens, then Kesebergs, Stanton with the Reeds, Graveses, and Murphys. The Donners waited and traveled last. After a few miles of rough terrain, an axle broke on one of the Donners' wagons. Jacob and George went into the woods to fashion a replacement. George Donner sliced his hand open while chiseling the wood, but it seemed a superficial wound.|$|E
5|$|Holst's {{comic opera}} The Perfect Fool (1923) was {{widely seen as}} a satire of Parsifal, though Holst firmly denied it. The piece, with Maggie Teyte in the leading soprano role and Eugene Goossens conducting, was enthusiastically {{received}} at its premiere in the Royal Opera House. At a concert in Reading in 1923, Holst slipped and fell, suffering concussion. He <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a good recovery, and he felt up to accepting {{an invitation to the}} US, lecturing and conducting at the University of Michigan. After he returned he found himself more and more in demand, to conduct, prepare his earlier works for publication, and, as before, to teach. The strain caused by these demands on him was too great; on doctor's orders he cancelled all professional engagements during 1924, and retreated to Thaxted. In 1925 he resumed his work at St Paul's Girls' School, but did not return to any of his other posts.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1991, Paul E. Dangerously {{formed the}} faction The Dangerous Alliance. Eaton {{joined the group}} when he {{assisted}} Rick Rude, whom Dangerously had (kayfabe) brought into WCW, in defeating Sting for the United States Championship. In joining the group, Eaton became allies with Rude, Larry Zbyszko, and his two former rivals for the World Television Championship in Arn Anderson and Steve Austin. Shortly after the group was formed, Anderson and Eaton became its tag team specialists. This <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sense, as both men had been successful tag team wrestlers in their careers; Anderson himself had been a two-time world champion teaming with Tully Blanchard in the Four Horsemen and had also won the belts with Zbyszko earlier in the year. Eaton and Anderson quickly won the WCW World Tag Team Championship by defeating Ricky Steamboat and Dustin Rhodes, the team to whom Anderson and Zbyszko lost the belts, for the championship and {{held on to the}} belts for five months before they lost them to the Steiner Brothers.|$|E

5|$|After 1905, Bosanquet played fewer {{first-class}} matches {{owing to}} his business career, and {{appeared as a}} batsman rather than an all-rounder. He played rarely for Middlesex, but usually <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> runs despite his lack of practice. He played four matches in 1906. He scored 87 and 101 for Middlesex against Somerset {{in his first game}} and took five for 51 against Yorkshire in his second. His good form continued in his third match for Middlesex as he scored two fifties against Essex and he was chosen for the Gentlemen against the Players. Although he did not bowl in that match, he scored 56 in the first innings. In total, he scored 415 runs at 51.87 and took eight wickets at 46.00. The following season, he played six matches for Middlesex, took two wickets and scored 358 runs at 35.00 with three fifties. Bosanquet played more often in 1908. He made 1,081 runs at an average of 54.05, topping the first-class batting averages. He scored centuries for Middlesex against Somerset and Lancashire in addition to five fifties. He represented the Gentlemen v Players twice—at Lord's and in an end of season festival game—without reaching fifty. However, in two other festival games in September, Bosanquet scored a fifty for the South against the North and scored 214, the highest score of his career, for the Rest of England against Yorkshire, the County Champions. In the season, he also took 12 wickets at an average of 29.00, although only bowling more than 10 overs in an innings three times, the final wickets of his career.|$|E

25|$|Socrates, {{attempting}} to flatter Phaedrus, responds {{that he is}} in ecstasy and that it is all Phaedrus' doing. Socrates comments that as the speech <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Phaedrus radiant, he is sure that Phaedrus understands these things better than he does himself, and that he cannot help follow Phaedrus' lead into his Bacchic frenzy. Phaedrus picks up on Socrates' subtle sarcasm and asks Socrates not to joke.|$|E
25|$|Haug's {{interpretation}} was {{gratefully received}} by the Parsis of Bombay, {{who at the time}} were under considerable pressure from Christian missionaries (most notable amongst them John Wilson) who sought converts among the Zoroastrian community and criticized Zoroastrianism for its alleged dualism as contrasted with their own monotheism. Haug's reconstruction had also other attractive aspects that <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the religion more compatible with nineteenth-century Enlightenment, as he attributed to Zoroaster a rejection of rituals and of worship of entities other than the supreme deity.|$|E

25|$|Belper {{remained}} a textile and hosiery centre into the 20th century. Meanwhile, other companies were developing: iron founding led to Park Foundry becoming {{a leader in}} the solid-fuel central-heating market; Adshead and Ratcliffe had developed Arbolite putty for iron-framed windows; Dalton and Company, which had been producing lubricating oils, developed ways of recovering used engine oil proving useful during the Second World War. In 1938, A. B. Williamson had developed a substance for conditioning silk stockings; the introduction of nylon stockings after the Second World War <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it redundant, but mechanics and fitters had discovered its usefulness in cleaning hands and it is still marketed by Deb Group as Swarfega.|$|E
25|$|Spotswood {{worked to}} make peace with his Iroquois neighbours, winning a {{concession}} from them in 1718, of all the land they had conquered as far as the Blue Ridge Mountains and south of the Potomac. This was confirmed at Albany in 1721. This clause was to be a bone of contention decades later, as it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the Blue Ridge the new demarcation between the Virginia Colony and Iroquois land. But the treaty technically stated that this mountain range was the border between the Iroquois and the Virginia Colony's Tributary Indians. White colonists considered this license to cross the mountains with impunity, which the Iroquois resisted. This dispute, which first flared in 1736 as Europeans began to settle the Shenandoah Valley, came to a head in 1743. It was resolved the next year by the Treaty of Lancaster, settled in Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|In United's next match, {{home cooking}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> all the difference, {{as the team}} won 3–2 on their return to RFK for United's first home match in 5 weeks. Playing at home in front of over 19,000 fans was {{probably}} a boost to the team, but an even bigger boost {{might have been the}} sight of the team's new striker tandem of Espindola and Saborio. The game started horribly for the home side as the Philadelphia Union scored in the first and fourth minute to take what might have seemed a commanding 2–0 lead. United began to claw their way back into the game as Saborio scored on his United debut, with a 37th minute volley of a Korb cross. The game was tied midway through the second half when Nick DeLeon finished a rebound of an Espindola shot. D.C. United finally went ahead on an Espindola header, with Chris Korb getting his second assist of the match. DeLeon's goal was his first in over a year in a regular season match.|$|E

25|$|During the 1968 Ashes series, D'Oliveira scored 158 on his recall to the England {{side in the}} 5th Test Match at The Oval, which <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his {{selection}} for the winter tour to South Africa a certainty. However, when the touring side was announced he was controversially omitted amidst allegations of South African political interference with the selection committee. Arlott was incensed and condemned the selectors' decision in his press articles and publicly stated {{that he would not}} commentate on any matches involving the South African team during their scheduled tour of England in 1970. Arlott received support from many people over his uncompromising stand, including future England captain Mike Brearley, who called for the cessation of all South African tours, and the Reverend David Sheppard, who {{had been one of the}} first players to speak out against apartheid and who had also previously refused to play against the 1960 South African touring side. However, Arlott was subjected to some strong, not entirely unexpected, criticism from the English cricket establishment over his stance particularly by the former England captain Peter May, a Test selector, who wrote directly to him condemning the position that he had adopted.|$|E
25|$|State legislatures can impeach state officials, {{including}} governors. The {{court for}} the trial of impeachments may differ somewhat from the federal model—in New York, for instance, the Assembly (lower house) impeaches, and the State Senate tries the case, but {{the members of the}} seven-judge New York State Court of Appeals (the state's highest, constitutional court) sit with the senators as jurors as well. Impeachment and removal of governors has happened occasionally throughout the history of the United States, usually for corruption charges. A total of at least eleven U.S. state governors have faced an impeachment trial; a twelfth, Governor Lee Cruce of Oklahoma, escaped impeachment conviction by a single vote in 1912. Several others, most recently Connecticut's John G. Rowland, have resigned rather than face impeachment, when events <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it inevitable. The most recent impeachment of a state governor occurred on January 14, 2009, when the Illinois House of Representatives voted 117-1 to impeach Rod Blagojevich on corruption charges; he was subsequently removed from office and barred from holding future office by the Illinois Senate on January 29. He was the eighth U.S. state governor to be removed from office.|$|E
25|$|Sherrard's {{touchdown}} {{made the}} score 21-10 going into halftime, {{and it turned}} out to be the final score of the day for the offenses of both teams. Washington advanced inside the 49ers 15-yard three times in the second half, but failed to score on all of them. On their second possession of the half, they advanced 66 yards to the 49ers 7-yard line before defensive back Johnnie Jackson picked off a third down pass intended for Monk in the end zone. Early in the fourth quarter, Monk caught three passes for 63 yards on a drive to the San Francisco 15, only to see Rypien get hit as he threw a pass, which floated right into the hands of cornerback Darryl Pollard. Linebacker Monte Coleman quickly gave the Redskins another chance to get back in the game, intercepting a pass from Montana and returning it 18 yards to the 49ers 19-yard line with 10:28 left in regulation. Faced with fourth down and 5 from the 14, Rypien threw the ball to receiver Gary Clark in the end zone. Defensive back Eric Davis <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> contact with Clark before the ball arrived, but no flag was thrown and the pass fell incomplete, causing a turnover on downs. In the closing minutes of the game, 49ers linebacker Charles Haley deflected a pass from Rypien into the arms of 295 pound defensive tackle Michael Carter, who rumbled 61 yards to the end zone to make the final score 28-10.|$|E
