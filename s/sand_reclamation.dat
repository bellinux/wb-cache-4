40|$|This {{interdisciplinary}} project offers {{new insights}} into the reclamation history of two of the most controversial and contaminated sites in Canadian history: the Sydney tar ponds and coke ovens and the Athabasca oil sands. It argues that Canada’s natural resource-dependent economy, combined with jurisdictional uncertainty, created a hesitant, fragmentary site cleanup regime, one that left room for different ideas about landscapes to shape and even distort reclamation’s goals and processes. In the absence of substantive reclamation standards and legislation, researchers struggled to accommodate the unique challenges of the oil sands during the 1960 s and 1970 s. Ambitious goals for reclamation faltered, and even the most successful examples of oil <b>sands</b> <b>reclamation</b> differed significantly from the pre-extraction environment; reclamation was not restoration. Planners envisioned transforming northeastern Alberta into a managed wilderness and recreation nirvana, but few of these plans were realised. The Sydney tar ponds experience suggests that truly successful reclamation cannot exist unless past injustices are fully acknowledged, reparations made, and a more complete narrative of contamination and reclamation constructed through open deliberation. Reclamation, after all, does not repair history; nor can it erase the past. Effective oil <b>sands</b> <b>reclamation,</b> then, requires a reconsideration of the site’s past and an acknowledgement of the perpetuated vulnerabilities and injustices wrought by development and reclamation...|$|R

5000|$|There {{was not one}} {{bottleneck}} to faster casting production {{but rather}} several. Improvements were made in molding speed, molding sand preparation, sand mixing, core manufacturing processes, and the slow metal melting rate in cupola furnaces. In 1912, the sand slinger was invented by the American company Beardsley & Piper. In 1912, the first sand mixer with individually mounted revolving plows was marketed by the Simpson Company. In 1915, the first experiments started with bentonite clay instead of simple fire clay as the bonding additive to the molding sand. This increased tremendously the green and dry strength of the molds. In 1918, the first fully automated foundry for fabricating hand grenades for the U.S. Army went into production. In the 1930s the first high-frequency coreless electric furnace was installed in the U.S. In 1943, ductile iron was invented by adding magnesium to the widely used grey iron. In 1940, thermal <b>sand</b> <b>reclamation</b> was applied for molding and core sands. In 1952, the [...] "D-process" [...] was developed for making shell molds with fine, pre-coated sand.

40|$|Peatlands (i. e., {{wetlands}} {{with organic}} soil) cover approximately 12 % of Canada’s total land area, 18 % of Alberta’s land base and {{nearly half of}} the landscape in Canada’s Western Boreal Plain. Some of these peatlands overlay vast fossil fuel resources. Mounting pressure from resource extraction industries is impacting an increasing proportion of peatland ecosystems in Canada. In Alberta, approximately 4800 km 2 of the Athabasca Oil Sands Region near Fort McMurray has been deemed suitable for surface mining, which involves the removal of large expanses of undisturbed peatlands to access the oil sands beneath. The concept of peatland creation has been adapted into the Canadian regulatory framework and fen peatlands have now been constructed in post-mined oil sands landscapes. However, there is little information with respect {{to the nature of the}} hydrological processes that operate within constructed fen ecosystems and their associated watersheds and this concept is only now being tested in the field. Oil <b>sands</b> <b>reclamation</b> requires the reconstruction of entire landforms and drainage systems. The hydrological regime of reclaimed landscapes will be a manifestation of the processes operating within the individual landforms that comprise it. Hydrology is the most important process regulating wetland function and development, as it exhibits a strong control on the chemical and biotic processes operating in peatlands. Accordingly, this research aims to tackle the growing and immediate need to understand the hydrological processes that operate within reconstructed landscapes. The approach is to couple the controls on water distribution, storage and release within several reclaimed landforms (reclaimed slopes, tailings sand upland aquifer and fen peatland) to the function of a constructed fen watershed (the Nikanotee Fen watershed). A comparison of two constructed fen ecosystems with fundamentally different conceptual approaches provides the framework for examination of the key challenges and opportunities associated with fen creation in an oil <b>sands</b> <b>reclamation</b> setting. Although the focus of this work is on the hydrological processes, issues related to both water quantity and quality are identified as major challenges for fen creation. An adaptive approach to fen creation is recommended, in which the knowledge developed in concurrent research should be assimilated with the available longer-term information. The multi-faceted complexities associated with the ability to deem fen creation projects a success within the context of oil <b>sands</b> <b>reclamation</b> are also explored. The suggestion from this discourse was that success should be measured by the ability to design and construct systems that exhibit predictable and desirable characteristics. The distribution, ablation and fate of snowmelt waters were quantified for the constructed watershed, which addresses a lack of understanding of snowmelt dynamics within reclaimed landscapes. Results indicated that the snowmelt period hydrology within recently constructed landscapes is fundamentally different from that reported for natural settings. Reclaimed slopes represented large stores of over-winter precipitation and generated substantial surface runoff during the snowmelt period. This research demonstrates that snow dynamics must be incorporated into the design of landscape-scale constructed ecosystems. The dominant controls on the soil water regimes and runoff generation mechanisms on two reclaimed slopes (reclaimed five years apart) within the Nikanotee Fen watershed were also investigated during the snow-free period. The contrasting hydrological regime exhibited by these slopes suggests that changes in the hydrophysical properties of reclamation materials following construction could result in a shift in the hydrological role of reclaimed slopes at the watershed scale. It appears that, over time, recently reclaimed slopes should produce less overland flow and shift from water conveyors to water storage features in constructed watershed systems. Finally, the water fluxes within the Nikanotee Fen – upland system were evaluated for the first two years following construction (2013 - 2014). The hydrological performance of the constructed system was assessed and discussed within the context of the construction-level design. It was determined that the system design was capable of sustaining wet conditions within the Nikanotee Fen during the snow-free period in 2013 and 2014, with persistent ponded water in some areas. Evapotranspiration dominated the water fluxes from the system. These losses were partially offset by groundwater discharge from the upland aquifer, which demonstrated strong hydrologic connectivity with the fen in spite of most construction materials having lower than targeted saturated hydraulic conductivities. However, the variable surface infiltration rates and thick placement of a soil-capping layer constrained recharge to the upland aquifer, which remained below designed water contents in much of the upland. These studies comprise one of the most comprehensive hydrological evaluations of a constructed fen peatland watershed to date. The findings of this research indicate that it is possible to engineer the post-mining landscape to accommodate the hydrological functions of a fen peatland. Several recommendations are made to help guide the construction of future fen peatlands, which should be done at the commercial-scale. Research priorities include understanding the storage and release of water within coarse-grained reclaimed landforms as well as evaluating the relative importance of external water sources and internal water conservation mechanisms for the viability of fen ecosystems over the longer-term. The novel, catchment-scale approach to reclamation research presented within this thesis provides an integrated understanding of the hydrological functioning of constructed watersheds, and a similar approach is recommended for future research in reclaimed landscapes...|$|R

40|$|Oil sands mining in {{northern}} Alberta impacts a large footprint, {{but the industry}} is committed to reclaim all disturbed land to an ecologically healthy state in response to environmental regulations.

High-throughput sequencing techniques {{can be used to}} provide a detailed characterization of microbial community structure. This study used 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize the bacterial root microbiome associated with annual barley (Hordeum vulgare) and sweet clover (Melilotus albus) growing in an oil <b>sands</b> <b>reclamation</b> area. Our results indicate that Proteobacteria dominated the endosphere, whereas other phyla such as Acidobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes were restricted to the rhizosphere, suggesting that plants have the ability to select for certain soil bacterial consortia. The bacterial community in the endosphere compartments were less rich and diverse compared to the rhizosphere. Furthermore, it was apparent that sweet clover plants were more selective, as the community exhibited a lower richness and diversity compared to barley. Members of the family Rhizobiaceae, such as Sinorhizobium and Rhizobium were mainly associated with clover, whereas Acholeplasma (wall-less bacteria transmitted by insects) was unique to barley. Genera from the Enterobacteriaceae family, such as Yersinia and Lentzea were also mostly detected in barley, while other genera such Pseudomonas and Pantoea were able to successfully colonize both plants. Endophytic bacterial profiles varied within the same plant species at different sampling locations; however, these differences were driven by factors other than slope positions or cover management.

40|$|Successful {{establishment}} of boreal tree seedlings like trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss.) in reclaimed oil sands mining sites is often limited by low nutrient availability and {{competition from the}} ground cover vegetation like planted cover crops and weeds. Competing vegetation can adversely affect seedling establishment by augmenting the impacts of moisture and nutrient stress. Despite high potential of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and oats (Avena sativa) as cover crops in oil <b>sands</b> <b>reclamation,</b> it was not well known how these crops interact with fertilization to influence early survival and growth of tree seedlings. This study evaluated the potential of fertilization and other silvicultural practices to improve revegetation success in oil sands sites reclaimed with peat-mineral mixture. Fertilizer application significantly increased height and root collar diameter (RCD) of tree seedlings in controlled environment greenhouse conditions, but not at a field research site near Fort McMurray, Alberta. In a greenhouse study, alleviating soil moisture stress significantly increased height, RCD, and biomass of tree seedlings. Vigorous growth of ground cover vegetation stimulated by fertilizer addition in both the greenhouse and field, largely controlled survival and growth responses of tree seedlings. Survival rates of tree seedlings were significantly decreased with increased fertilizer application rates, and no positive growth responses were observed in the field. Maximum seedlings survival (92 %) was recorded without fertilization. Trembling aspen was sensitive to ground cover competition, whereas white spruce was unaffected. The inherent fertility of the peat-mineral mixture appeared sufficient for establishment and early growth of planted tree seedlings in recently reclaimed oil sands sites. Fertilization appeared to increase competition between tree seedlings and cover vegetation by promoting increased growth and competition for other resources like water. Effects on growth over the longer term (several years) should be evaluated in future studies. ...|$|R

Estimates of plankton and periphyton community growth, measured as chl a and dry weight, were low and similar in reference and OSPM reclamation wetlands. The use of stable isotope analyses revealed higher δ 15 N of plankton and periphyton in OSPM wetlands than reference wetlands, possibly {{due to increased}} TN concentrations in some OSPM wetlands. In the laboratory, water-soluble fractions (WSF) of two types of OSPM (mature fine tailings, MFT and consolidated tailings, CT) and an amendment material (peat-mineral mixture), potential fill materials in wetland or end pit lake reclamation, were examined for phytoplankton community growth and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. All WSF treatments had higher chl a compared to reference water and maximum growth was observed at a 50 : 50 ratio of peat:CT or peat:MFT. In general, WSFs of peat had the highest concentration of total nitrogen (TN) whereas WSFs of MFT had the highest total phosphorus (TP; 3 x higher). The results suggested that the addition of peat as an amendment to OSPM (particularly for MFT), contributing additional TN, could improve phytoplankton community growth in oil <b>sands</b> <b>reclamation.</b> At higher percentages of MFT WSF, there was increased turbidity due to fine clay particles that likely contributed to reduced phytoplankton growth. Turbidity could {{be an important factor}} limiting phytoplankton growth and thus reducing dietary resources and biological detritus (via sedimentation) in the initial development of an end pit lake. The WSFs also promoted the unfavourable growth of filamentous algae, highest at intermediate concentrations of peat and CT WSFs and inhibited in MFT WSFs due to light limitation. Stable N isotopes of plankton and filamentous algae suggests that 15 N enrichment of algae could be a useful indicator of nutrient inputs, including OSPM seepage into natural aquatic systems, for oil sands regional monitoring programs...|$|R

40|$|Mining for {{oil sands}} in the Athabasca Basin in northeastern Alberta is rapidly expanding. As {{economics}} continue to drive growing mining practices, waste management, reclamation and bio-monitoring strategies {{are becoming increasingly}} important. This project aims to determine the practicality of testate amoebae assemblages {{as an indicator of}} microbial community health and ecosystem establishment in wetlands impacted by oil sand processed materials (OSPM). Testate amoebae are unicellular, shelled protists that live in abundance in soils, leaf litter and in fresh water habitats. This group of protists forms shells (or tests) which makes them relatively easy to identify. Ecological studies have shown they occupy specific niches controlled by environmental parameters such as pH and moisture variables. These features make testate amoebae excellent bioindicators, and this project explores the potential of applying testate amoebae bioindicators in wetlands affected by OSPM. Using compound and epifluorescent microscopy techniques, testate amoebae species assemblages were identified and tabulated from a series of wetlands with different impacts by oil sands processed materials. Bacterial and fungal proportions were characterized to compare with the testate amoebae and identify possible links within the microbial community. A total of 44 species of testate amoebae were encountered in 24 wetlands, with Centropyxis platystoma and Centropyxis aculeata being the most common taxa. Natural peatland sites, not affected by OSPM contained the most diverse assemblage of testate amoebae containing Arcella, Assulina, Centropyxis, Englypha, and Heleopera. Open-water wetlands not impacted by OSPM were less diverse than peatland sites, but maintained between two and 12 taxa per site. Open-water sites amended with OSPM contained fewer taxa (between 0 and 4 taxa at any given site) and fewer individuals than any other site type, with Difflugia being most common. Bacteria contributed an average of 65 % of the microbial community in open-water sites and an average of 80 % in peatland sites. Peatland sites were significantly different (P< 0. 05) from all other site types in terms of testate amoebae, bacteria, and fungal biomass. This study demonstrated that differences exist in testate amoebae assemblages between site types do exist, this study establishes the fact that testate amoebae are too few (< 1 % of biomass), and not in sync with the other microbial facets studied (bacteria and fungi) limiting their use as bioindicators of microbial community establishment in wetlands impacted by oil sands processed materials.
