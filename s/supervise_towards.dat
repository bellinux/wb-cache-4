40|$|The {{development}} of {{hotel in the}} city of Yogyakarta is undeniable, since the city of Yogyakarta is one of the cities of tourism in Indonesia, which has a distinctive attraction for domestic and foreign traveller. Nevertheless, with the increasing growth of hotels {{in the city of}} Yogyakarta, the need for ground water will be getting higher. If this issue is not properly controlled, could lead to the city of Yogyakarta on experiencing drought in the next few years. In conjunction with that issue, accordingly The Environmental Institution in the city of Yogyakarta as the government who authorized to supervise the utilization of ground water by the hotels, specifically all hotels are mandatory to provide reports periodically every 6 months to The Environmental Institution of the Yogyakarta city towards the quality testing result of wastewater, the water quality and the exhaust gas. Futhermore, The Environmental Institution in the city of Yogyakarta also conduct inspection, encouraging public participation, cordinating with other institutions and socialization. Nevertheless, in carrying out its supervision. The Environmental Institution in the city of Yogyakarta have major constraint that is the lack human resources, so that the supervision that conducted did not go well. This research is empirical and this data obtained from interviews with The Environmental Institution of the city of Yogyakarta, The Environmental Forum, Department Of Settlement and Regional Infrastructure, Inna Garuda Hotel, Ibis Style Hotel, Cempaka Hotel and Mataram Hotel. The role of The Environmental Institution in the city of Yogyakarta as the Institution who <b>supervise</b> <b>towards</b> the hotel which is located in the city of Yogyakarta is extremely important, to ensure the availablity of water for the society in general evenly. Nevertheless, The Environmental Institution should add the human resources, so that the supervision could work well conducted...|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to reveal}} the {{attitude}} of school principals and <b>supervising</b> teachers <b>towards</b> practice teaching and identify possible areas of improvement in training. The study revealed that the supervising teachers have "a sense of fulfillment" on practice teaching. The study also revealed that the supervising teachers taught student teachers "how {{to get involved with}} children", "understand them", and "how to prepare lesson plans". Further, supervising teachers feel that before practice teaching student teachers should study and learn the "teacher 2 ̆ 7 s role", the "characteristics of disorders", and "how to prepare lesson plans". The survey conducted among principals of the schools that accept student teachers indicated that they positively evaluate the "attitude" of the student teachers toward the training. However, the principals feel that student teachers should study and learn the "teacher 2 ̆ 7 s role", and "how to prepare lesson plans" before practice teaching...|$|R
40|$|An {{image is}} nothing but a {{projection}} of the physical world around us, where objects do not occur randomly but follow certain spatial rules. Many existing computer vision approaches tend to ignore this aspect of understanding images. In this work, we build representations and propose strategies for exploiting such constraints towards extracting a 3 D understanding of a scene from its single image. We model a scene in terms of its spatial layout abstracted as a box, object cuboids, camera viewpoint, and interactions between them. We take a <b>supervised</b> approach <b>towards</b> estimation, and learn models from training data that is fully annotated with the 3 D spatial extent of objects, walls, and floor. We assume the world is populated with axis aligned objects and surfaces, and exploit constrained appearance models which use geometric cues from the scene. Our methods are tailored towards indoor scenes that are highly structured and require careful spatial reasoning. We show that our box layout representation is able to capture the ful...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} part of a two-part article which {{documents}} the conclusions of a group of experienced social work practitioners regarding the theory of social development and its applicability to social work practice in South Africa. Part I examiners the theoretical underpinnings of social development which is advanced as primarily a normative macro-policy perspective within which to situate a changed focus for social work-practice. It is believed that social development does not present anything new for social workers and could even be described as the ecosystems perspective in a new guise. Like the ecosystems perspective, social development attempts too much. (Part 2 will be published in the October l 99 l edition.) The paper is based on the first Developmental Social Work (DSW) Coursework Master’s Programme taught at the University of Natal in Durban (UND). This two-year Part-time programme was designed specifically for social work practitioners who had graduated at least two years prior to resuming study but preferably who had been in practice for more than five years. Ten students enrolled for the programme, between them they had nearly one hundred and fifty Years of practice experience (Table I). All were in positions in their work situation where they were able to influence their organisation or the social workers whom they were <b>supervising</b> <b>towards</b> the introduction of developmental social work. In addition to the developmental social work course, students also studied advanced social work theory, research and social policy, and were required to conduct a research project. The first half of the DSW course involved a theoretical study of social development using Midgley (1995) as a foundation text. Students were provided with a detailed course outline and a substantial reading list. In addition, the Social Development Issues Journal was made available to them, with students borrowing and circulating the various issues among themselves. These were the minimum reading requirements which students supplemented with their own literature studies. The second half of the programme involved in-class presentations where students were required to critically evaluate social development theory and to examine its applicability to their particular practice context, suggesting ways in which DSW has in the past, or might in the future, be applied in their organisations. An essay on this topic constituted their course assignment. It is on the content of these essays and class discussions that this paper is based...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores primary desistance as a {{transitional}} phase between offending and crime cessation. Recent work has explored desistance within an integrated theoretical framework, combining {{elements of both}} structure and agency theories, and this thesis builds upon this by exploring the initial transitions towards desistance, and the prospective strategies to sustain it, {{among a group of}} adult male offenders under Probation supervision. Where agency has been employed in such accounts its conceptualisation has tended to be vague, and this thesis seeks to address this by examining agency as the temporally located reflexive deliberations of adult offenders upon their future goals and present social environment. This allows for the identification of individuals’ future goals in relation to desistance and the strategies that they intend to pursue to achieve them, in relation to their personal and social contexts. The thesis finds that recent Probation policy has delimited the role of <b>supervising</b> officer <b>towards</b> that of Offender Manager, which inhibits the relationship between officer and offender such that would-be desisters tend to revert to past repertoires of thought and action in their strategies. This is likely to sustain the social contexts that led to offending in the past, and is likely to hinder desistance in the future. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Feature {{selection}} {{is a central}} problem in data analysis that have received a signicant amount of attention from several disciplines, such as machine learning or pattern recognition. However, {{most of the research}} has been addressed <b>towards</b> <b>supervised</b> tasks, paying little attention to unsupervised learning. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised feature selection method for symbolic clustering tasks. Our method is based upon the assumption that, in the absence of class labels, we can deem as irrelevant those features that exhibit low dependencies with the rest of features. Experiments with several data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to detect completely irrelevant features and that, additionally, it removes other features without signicantly hurting the performance of the clustering algorithm. Key words: Feature selection, clustering, data preprocessing. ...|$|R
5000|$|One {{criticism}} of after-school activities {{is that they}} provide too much rigidity within a child's life. Advocates of slow parenting believe that children {{should be allowed to}} develop their own ideas. Getting bored is a step towards having an idea for something else to do, and having little or no adult interference allows children to express their own creativity. Proponents of this theory argue that structured after-school programs have the potential to take away avenues for such creativity and self-expression amongst children. Similarly, the Taoist concept of wu wei, literally translated as [...] "non-action," [...] supports spontaneity in daily life. Thus, while there may be some children that benefit from being <b>supervised</b> and pushed <b>towards</b> didactic goals through organized after-school activities, others might end up achieving more on their own, or with minimal supervision.|$|R
40|$|Every {{construction}} {{project is a}} unique, complex process. Every completed structure is permanent act into space, and has therefore substantial influence upon social and natural environment. As a consequence, {{it is essential to}} provide professional supervision of the construction process that will ensure conformity of the construction with the project documentation and the building permit. The purpose of the thesis is to present the role of the construction supervision and the work of the supervising engineer within the {{construction project}}, through all the phases of the project. The analysis is carried out on the basis of construction legislature analysis. The relevant legislature provides requirements for conditions, duties and responsibilities of the <b>supervising</b> engineer <b>towards</b> the owner, as well as towards public interest. The first part of the thesis summarizes and discusses the relevant legislature that affects the work of the supervising engineer. The importance of quality in the construction process is discussed, and the work of the supervising engineer in all construction stages (design, construction, maintenance) is presented. Three case studies, where key tasks of the supervisor are analyzed, are presented. The structures to be built within the selected projects have various levels of importance and therefore require different scope of supervising activities. Supervising the construction is responsible and presents a key activity in quality assurance during construction. As the role of construction supervision is often unclear, it leaves open several questions, especially from the view point of his authorization and liability in case of professionally conducted work. ...|$|R

25|$|Caine and his wife, Mary, {{spent four}} winters in Rome, renting a house, 18 Trinità de' Monti, near the Spanish Steps. On their visit between January and April 1901 Caine {{finished}} The Eternal City, his greatest commercial success. It is Caine’s only novel {{to be first}} conceived as a play. The story begins in Rome in 1900 at the fictional Pope Pius X’s jubilee celebrations, {{at the height of}} the dispute between the Vatican and the Italian state on the temporal power of the Church. David Rossi, a socialist and republican is accused of conspiring to assassinate the Italian king. He opposes Baron Bonelli, a corrupt prime minister. Bonelli tries to prevent the culmination of the love story between his mistress Donna Roma Volonna and Rossi. The Eternal City was serialised in Britain in 1901 in The Lady's Magazine and in the United States in Collier's Weekly, between February and August 1901. Immediately afterwards it was published in book form by Heinemann, with an initial print run of 100,000, running to twenty-six editions, selling more than a million copies in English alone and translated into thirteen languages. The stage adaptation opened at His Majesty's Theatre, London on 2 October 1902, produced by actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree, with incidental music by Italian composer Pietro Mascagni. A week after the play opened in London, Caine republished the novel, cutting all the political parts and following the story of the play making it into a ‘theatre edition’. The American production of The Eternal City premiered on 17 November, at the Victoria Theatre, New York City, with Viola Allen as Roma, Frederic De Belleville as Bonelli, and Edward J. Morgan as Rossi. Caine <b>supervised</b> rehearsals. <b>Towards</b> the end of 1903 six companies were performing The Eternal City, in England, USA, Australia and South Africa.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{cerebellum}} {{plays an}} essential role in adaptive motor control. Once we are able to build a cerebellar model that runs in realtime, which means that a computer simulation of 1 s in the simulated world completes within 1 s in the real world, the cerebellar model {{could be used as a}} realtime adaptive neural controller for physical hardware such as humanoid robots. In this paper, we introduce “Realtime Cerebellum (RC) ”, a new implementation of our large-scale spiking network model of the cerebellum, which was originally built to study cerebellar mechanisms for simultaneous gain and timing control and acted as a general-purpose supervised learning machine of spatiotemporal information known as reservoir computing, on a graphics processing unit (GPU). Owing to the massive parallel computing capability of a GPU, RC runs in realtime, while reproducing qualitatively the same simulation results of the Pavlovian delay eyeblink conditioning with the previous version. RC is adopted as a realtime adaptive controller of a humanoid robot, which is instructed to learn a proper timing to swing a bat to hit a flying ball online. These results suggest that RC provides a means to apply the computational power of the cerebellum as a versatile <b>supervised</b> learning machine <b>towards</b> engineering applications...|$|R
40|$|Fuzzy {{mediation}} is {{an innovative}} {{approach to the}} cre-ation of a framework geared <b>towards</b> <b>supervised</b> and collaborative learning in systems with two controllers, one being an expert controller and the second being a novice one. The nature of fuzzy sets allows for the com-parison of inputs to reach a consensus on the overall difference between the controls. In previous works we have highlighted {{the importance of this}} concept and the aptitude and ease with which this framework adapts it-self to agents based on fuzzy learning mechanisms to navigate through a preset course. In this paper we ex-plore the relationship that different mediation equations have when related to different learning environments. We explore five different functions in relation to the tasks being accomplished by an artificial agent navigat-ing through a preset course. We also look in detail at the reaction times between algorithms when different tightness of control is used within the fuzzy mediation core engine. This paper highlights the appropriateness of each of the five mediation equations in relation to the setting in which the fuzzy mediation framework is de-ployed. Moreover, we guide potential users through the analysis of tightness of control also as it is appropriate to the same environments of deployment of this frame-work...|$|R
40|$|Magister Artium (Psychology) - MA(Psych) It {{is often}} assumed that {{postgraduate}} students and neophyte academics {{have the capacity}} to conduct research independently. Thus, upon qualification, it is expected of postgraduate students and academics to conduct research independently, publish their findings, meet publication targets and to <b>supervise</b> student research <b>towards</b> completion. However, the transition from postgraduate student or clinician to academia is considered very challenging as they are often not prepared for the multiple changes they will embark on upon entry into the Higher Education sector. As a result, various programmes and frameworks have been introduced to assist new academics in enhancing their research capacity. Such strategies included but were not limited to, writing retreats, peer monitoring, and dedicated time. However, these interventions reported on in literature are from primary sources and fail to comment on either the methodological rigour or the quality of the studies investigating these interventions. Thus there exists a gap in the literature for filtered information that has been systematically evaluated for methodological rigour and coherence. The present study aimed to establish an empirical base (filtered evidence) of literature reporting on strategies or interventions aimed at addressing research productivity in new academics. The study incorporated a systematic review methodology to identify appropriate literature for inclusion, evaluate literature for methodological quality and provide a meta-synthesis of the findings of included studies. The review considered studies, reporting on strategies or interventions with new academics during the period of 2000 - 2013. The review was conducted along three levels. Firstly, identification of potential titles, whereby keywords were combined and a comprehensive search of databases available at the University of the Western Cape library was initiated. Published research was also retrieved through mining the reference list of all included reports and articles. Secondly, a pair of reviewers worked together by screening the abstracts which were retrieved based on the titles identified, and thirdly, the abstracts that were successfully screened moved forward to full text reading. These studies were evaluated for methodological quality using the critical appraisal tool. Eligibility for inclusion was determined by a threshold score of 61 %. As a result, the title search yielded a search result of 755, from these only 63 titles were selected for possible inclusion. The abstract screening resulted in the exclusion of 35 articles and 28 were included. After the critical appraisal, 15 articles were excluded. The findings of the present study revealed that there is good quality research on research capacity building for neophyte academics, as assessed on methodological rigour and coherence. Seven articles attained the threshold score (61 % and above) for inclusion in the final summation and meta-synthesis. Evidence suggested that there are various interventions which have been implemented successfully to enhance research capacity building. The meta-synthesis revealed four core approaches to developing research capacity, namely mentoring approaches, theoretical formulations, research/evidence-based investigation as well as a multidimensional and integrated approaches. These approaches were aimed at bridging that gap between research and teaching and developing competent researchers. The core feature that emerged from these approaches was that successful or effective strategies have to include numerous components such as individual characteristics (motivation), effective leaders and institutional characteristics (rewards, incentives and resources). It was found that these components were integrated and often reciprocally influencing. Ethics clearance was obtained from the relevant committees at UWC. Furthermore, plagiarism and collaboration was taken into account as this study forms part of a larger project...|$|R
