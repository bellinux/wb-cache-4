5|$|West Nohno {{had made}} her way to Hampton Roads, Virginia, by 29 May, when she sailed for Key West, Florida. After her 4 June arrival at Key West, she began a nine-month journey to Alexandria, Cairo, and other ports. During this {{extended}} voyage, three crewmen entered one of West Nohnos fuel tanks to clean it while the ship was at Suez on 29 September 1942. The crewmen did not use gas masks and were soon overcome by fumes. The <b>second</b> <b>mate</b> of the Norwegian tanker Britannia, Henning Vaagsnes, entered the tank and removed all three men. Two of West Nohnos men survived but the third, despite two hours of attempts to revive him by Vaagsnes, did not. For his efforts, Vaagsnes received a pair of binoculars from U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt and a gold watch from the ship owners. He was also awarded St. Olav's medal with Oak Branch, a medal awarded for personal courage and bravery by the Norwegian government.|$|E

25|$|Mates {{direct a}} ship's routine {{operation}} for the captain during work shifts, which are called watches. Mates stand watch for specified periods, usually in three duty sections, with 4 hours on watch and 8 hours off. When on a navigational watch, mates direct a bridge team by conning, directing courses through the helmsman and speed through the lee helmsman (or directly in open ocean). When {{more than one}} mate is necessary aboard a ship, they typically are designated chief mate or first mate, <b>second</b> <b>mate</b> and third mate. In addition to watch standers, mates directly supervise the ship's crew, and are assigned other tasks. The chief mate is usually in charge of cargo, stability and the deck crew, the <b>second</b> <b>mate</b> in charge of navigation plans and updates and the third mate as the safety officer. They also monitor and direct deck crew operations, such as directing line handlers during moorings, and anchorings, monitor cargo operations and supervise crew members engaged in maintenance and the vessel's upkeep.|$|E
25|$|A {{third mate}} (3/M) or third officer is a {{licensed}} {{member of the}} deck department of a merchant ship.

40|$|ABSTRACTIn Drosophila ananassae, male remating was studied using ten {{mass culture}} stocks which were {{initiated}} from flies collected from different geographic localities. Male remating occurs {{at a high}} fre-quency and varies within narrow limits (84  96 percent) in different strains. Interestingly, male remating time (in min) varies from 7. 41 (Bhutan) to 21. 59 (PAT) in different strains and the variation is highly significant. Further, the results also show that males copulate for shorter duration during <b>second</b> <b>mating.</b> This is the first report in the genus Drosophila which provides evidence for interstrain variations for male remating {{time as well as}} for shorter duration of copulation during <b>second</b> <b>mating</b> as compared to first mating in D. ananassae...|$|R
25|$|Early whaling captains {{and their}} crews were well-paid if the boats netted their prey. In 1907, for instance, George Leavitt and his vessel Narwhal, steam whaler, took some 15 bowhead whales.

The ship arrived at Rugged Island off Livingston Island, where its British crew landed on Christmas Day 1819, and claimed the islands for King George III. A narrative of the events was published by the brig's master, Joseph Herring, in the July 1820 edition of the Imperial Magazine. The Espirito Santo was followed from the Falkland Islands by the American brig Hersilia, commanded by Captain James Sheffield (with <b>second</b> <b>mate</b> Nathaniel Palmer), the first US sealer in the South Shetlands.|$|E
