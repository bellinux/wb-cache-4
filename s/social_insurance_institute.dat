Since 1951, <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> medicine, called work capacity medical assessment, is an independent medical specialty.

County medical services of social security apply the law regulations relating to the public system of <b>social</b> <b>insurance.</b> The National <b>Institute</b> of Medical Assessment and Work Capacity Rehabilitation (INEMRCM – Romanian abbreviation) manages and controls the activity of all medical services. INEMRCM is a public institutionunder the authority of the National House of Pensions and Other <b>Social</b> <b>Insurance</b> Rights.
