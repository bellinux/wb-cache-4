5|$|Despite much speculation, {{there is}} no {{definitive}} explanation of either Linnaeus fils or Herbert's thinking. For instance the 'Knight's Star' {{has been compared to}} Linnaeus' decoration as a Knight of the Order of the Polar Star. The Latin word equestris (of a knight, or horseman) may have been confused with equi (of a horse), or possibly Herbert was making a literary Knight's Move on the Linnaean term. The flower name has even been compared to the mediaeval weapon, the <b>spoked</b> mace or Morning Star which it superficially resembles.|$|E
5|$|The {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) driving wheels which were lighter, yet stronger than the <b>spoked</b> equivalent. These proved to be successful and were later used on other Bulleid classes. The leading bogie was based upon that of the SR Lord Nelson class, although it had a 6ft 3 in (1.90 m) wheelbase as opposed to Maunsell's 7ft 6 in (2.28 m) design, and featured 3ft 1 in (0.94 m) BFB wheels. A long coupled driving wheelbase was incorporated into the design, to keep the locomotives within the lineal loading of the Southern Railway's narrower bridges. The supporting rear trailing truck was a one-piece steel casting that gave the smoothest of rides; the design was utilised in the future BR Standard Class 7.|$|E

25|$|The {{critical}} invention {{that allowed}} the construction of light, horse-drawn chariots was the <b>spoked</b> wheel. The earliest spoke-wheeled chariots date to ca. 2000BC.

25|$|Two-wheeled and four-wheeled chariots (singular carbad) {{were used}} in Ireland from ancient times, both in private life and in war. They were big enough for two people, made of {{wickerwork}} and wood, and often had decorated hoods. The wheels were <b>spoked,</b> shod all round with iron, and were from three to {{four and a half}} feet high. Chariots were generally drawn by horses or oxen, with horse-drawn chariots being more common among chiefs and military men. War chariots furnished with scythes and spikes, like those of the ancient Gauls and Britons, are mentioned in literature.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the utility}} of the horse as a means of {{transportation}} became clear the horses (actually ponies) began being bred for strength, and by the 3rd millennium BC they were strong enough to pull chariots. By 2000 BC, war chariots had <b>spoked</b> wheels, thus being made more manoeuvrable, and dominated the battlefields. The growing use of the horse, combined with the failure, roughly around 2000 BC, of the always precarious irrigation systems that had allowed for extensive agriculture in the region, gave rise and dominance of pastoral nomadism by 1000 BC, {{a way of life that}} would dominate the region for the next several millennia.|$|E
500|$|Each {{of the two}} bogies {{had three}} cylinders, with the driving wheels {{connected}} by chains enclosed in an oil-bath, based upon Bulleid's chain-driven valve gear on his Pacific locomotives. The valve gear used the unusual sleeve valve arrangement that was also tested on the ex-LB H1 class Hartland Point in parallel {{with the construction of}} the first Leader locomotive. The Leader was the first steam locomotive to use a form of sleeve valve since Cecil Paget's locomotive of 1908 and the concurrent testing of the principle on Hartland Point hints at the rushed nature of the locomotive's conception. The locomotive sat on the unusual Bulleid Firth Brown wheels, which were lighter, yet stronger, than the <b>spoked</b> equivalent.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} A1s were {{coupled to}} a traditional Great Northern type of tender with coal rails of a design that {{can be traced back}} to Stirling days. The A1-variant was a much-enlarged eight-wheel version carrying [...] of coal and [...] of water. In 1928, a new special type of tender body was built for the new non-stop Flying Scotsman train. This tender had a corridor connection and an access tunnel through the water tank. It was of a more modern design with high side sheets curved in at the top and had a coal capacity of [...] In order to be able to pack an extra ton of coal, a single coal rail was provided on this particular series, but was later deemed unnecessary. Ten of these corridor tenders were built, and a non-corridor version of similar design followed with 8-ton coal capacity and no coal rail. Further series of both types had disc wheels instead of the previous <b>spoked</b> variety.|$|E
500|$|The typical carters were [...] {{descended from}} French [...] of the fur trade and their Ojibway spouses. Their {{conveyance}} was the Red River ox cart, a simple vehicle derived {{either from the}} two-wheeled [...] used in French Canada, or from Scottish carts. From 1801 on, this cart was modified {{so that it was}} made solely from local materials. [...] It contained no iron at all. Instead it was constructed entirely of wood and animal hide. Two twelve-foot-long parallel oak shafts or [...] "trams" [...] bracketed the draft animal in front and formed the frame of the cart to the rear. Cross-pieces held the floorboards, while front, side and rear boards or rails enclosed the box. These wooden pieces were joined by mortices and tenons. The axle was also made of seasoned oak. It was lashed to the cart by strips of wet bison hide known by its Cree name of shaganappi, which shrank and tightened as they dried. The axles connected two <b>spoked</b> wheels, five or six feet in diameter, which were [...] "dished" [...] or {{in the form of a}} shallow cone, the apex of which was at the hubs, which were inboard of the rims. [...] The carts were originally drawn by small horses obtained from the First Nations. After cattle were brought to the colony in the 1820s, oxen were used to haul the carts. They were preferred because of their strength, endurance, and cloven hooves which spread their weight in swampy areas.|$|E
