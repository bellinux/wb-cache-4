5|$|Rear Admiral John P. Whitney {{requested}} Shepard's {{services as}} an aide de camp, but Shepard wanted to fly. Therefore, at Shepard's request, Ramage spoke to the admiral on his behalf, and Shepard was instead sent back to Patuxent. He flight tested the McDonnell F3H Demon, Vought F-8 Crusader, Douglas F4D Skyray and Grumman F-11 Tiger. The Vought F7U Cutlass {{had a tendency to}} go into an inverted spin during a <b>snap</b> <b>roll.</b> This was not unusual; many aircraft did this, but normally if the pilot let go of the stick the aircraft would correct itself. When he attempted this in the F7U, Shepard found this was not the case. He was unable {{to break out of the}} spin and was forced to eject. In 1957, he was project test pilot on the Douglas F5D Skylancer. Shepard did not like the plane, and gave it an unfavorable report. The Navy cancelled orders for it, buying the F8U instead. He also filed an unfavorable report on the F11F after a harrowing incident in which the engine failed on him during a high-speed dive. Fortunately, he managed to restart the engine.|$|E
25|$|On January 23, 1939, {{the sole}} {{prototype}} Douglas 7B twin-engine attack bomber, {{designed and built}} as a company project, suffered loss of vertical fin and rudder during demonstration flight over Mines Field, flat spun {{into the parking lot}} of North American Aviation, burned. Another source states that the test pilot, in an attempt to impress the Gallic passenger, attempted a <b>snap</b> <b>roll</b> at low altitude with one engine feathered, resulting in the fatal spin. Douglas test pilot Johnny Cable bailed out at 300 feet, chute unfurled but did not have time to deploy, killed on impact, flight engineer John Parks rode the airframe in and died, but 33-year-old French Air Force Capt. Paul Chemidlin, riding in aft fuselage near top turret, survived with broken leg, severe back injuries, slight concussion. Presence of Chemidlin, a representative of foreign purchasing mission, caused a furor in Congress by isolationists over neutrality and export laws. Type was developed as Douglas DB-7.|$|E

50|$|While a grain {{platform}} can be {{used for}} corn, a specialized corn head is ordinarily used instead. The corn head is equipped with <b>snap</b> <b>rolls</b> that strip the stalk and leaf away from the ear, so that only the ear (and husk) enter the throat. This improves efficiency dramatically since so much less material must go through the cylinder. The corn head can be recognized by the presence of points between each row.|$|R

50|$|The <b>snap</b> <b>roll</b> is an {{aggressive}} roll. The aircraft rotates about all axes {{at the same}} time, the predominant rotation being about the longitudinal axis. This sometimes violent maneuver is accomplished one of two ways. A positive, or inside, snap is executed by going hard over on all controls: full aileron, full rudder, and full up elevator. A negative, or outside, snap, is executed differently: full aileron, full opposite rudder, full down elevator.|$|E
50|$|The {{prototype}} Yak-5 first flew on 7 September 1944. The new fighter-trainer's handling proved {{popular with}} its test pilots, and the aircraft successfully passed official evaluation. In the end, neither the UT-2L or the Yak-5 entered production because the Soviet Air Force command believed wooden aircraft were becoming obsolete, which {{would result in}} production of the all-metal Yakovlev Yak-18 trainer in late 1945. The sole Yak-5 was destroyed when it suffered failure of the wooden wing during a <b>snap</b> <b>roll</b> and crashed.|$|E

50|$|The 'Skyote' is a {{conventional}} open-cockpit biplane design, with fixed, tailwheel undercarriage. The wings are slightly swept for center-of-gravity and lateral stability reasons {{and to improve}} performance in <b>snap</b> <b>rolls.</b> The equal-span, staggered wings are braced together with conventional struts and wires that form a single bay. Neither the upper nor lower wings have any dihedral, and ailerons are fitted to all four wings. The fuselage is built from welded steel tubing with wooden stringers and formers to give it shape, the wing structure is aluminum, and the entire aircraft is covered in fabric.|$|R
50|$|Before about World War II, most maize in North America was {{harvested}} by hand (as {{it still}} is {{in most of the}} other countries where it is grown). This often involved large numbers of workers and associated social events. Some one- and two-row mechanical pickers were in use but the corn combine was not adopted until after the War. By hand or mechanical picker, the entire ear is harvested which then requires a separate operation of a corn sheller to remove the kernels from the ear. Whole ears of corn were often stored in corn cribs and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use. Few modern farms store maize in this manner. Most harvest the grain from the field and store it in bins. The combine with a corn head (with points and <b>snap</b> <b>rolls</b> instead of a reel) does not cut the stalk; it simply pulls the stalk down. The stalk continues downward and is crumpled into a mangled pile on the ground. The ear of corn is too large to pass through a slit in a plate and the <b>snap</b> <b>rolls</b> pull the ear of corn from the stalk so that only the ear and husk enter the machinery. The combine separates the husk and the cob, keeping only the kernels.|$|R
5000|$|Despite these modifications, the P-51Bs and P-51Cs, and {{the newer}} P-51Ds and P-51Ks, {{experienced}} low-speed handling problems {{that could result}} in an involuntary [...] "snap-roll" [...] under certain conditions of air speed, angle of attack, gross weight, and center of gravity. Several crash reports tell of P-51Bs and P-51Cs crashing because horizontal stabilizers were torn off during maneuvering. As a result of these problems, a modification kit consisting of a dorsal fin was manufactured. One report stated:"Unless a dorsal fin is installed on the P-51B, P-51C and P-51D airplanes, a <b>snap</b> <b>roll</b> may result when attempting a slow roll. The horizontal stabilizer will not withstand the effects of a <b>snap</b> <b>roll.</b> To prevent recurrence, the stabilizer should be reinforced in accordance with T.O. 01-60J-18 dated 8 April 1944 and a dorsal fin should be installed. Dorsal fin kits are being made available to overseas activities"The dorsal fin kits became available in August 1944, and available as retrofits for P-51Bs and P-51Cs (but rarely used on the [...] "razorback" [...] -B and -C Mustangs), and to early P-51Ds and P-51Ks that had not already been built with them. Also incorporated was a change to the rudder trim tabs, which would help prevent the pilot over-controlling the aircraft and creating heavy loads on the tail unit.|$|E
50|$|The {{remaining}} F-105 {{found himself}} in the sights of another MiG-17 who he could not shake. In desperation, he tried a <b>snap</b> <b>roll</b> which slowed his plane so that the MiG-17 over-shot him, as his captain had recommended. Finding himself on the MiG's tail, he was too surprised to attempt to shoot down the MiG with his gun. The fortunate pilot was briefed the day before about this maneuver by Captain John Boyd from Nellis Air Force Base, who would later become a significant voice in the design of America's fighter aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Cruse died on August 22, 2009, {{when her}} light plane, a {{borrowed}} Zivko Edge 540, registration N540BW, crashed onto the famous Silverstone Race Circuit in Britain during a qualifying flight for the World Aerobatic Championships. According to witnesses, having completed a vertical climb, she had pushed the nose {{over at the}} top in order to descend vertically. She then performed a one and one-quarter <b>snap</b> <b>roll.</b> The objective was to stop rotation after the aircraft has rolled one and one-quarter times, but rotation in this case only slowed, continuing to the ground.

He invented a number of original <b>snap</b> <b>rolls</b> and, in 1984, the [...] "knife-edge spin". In 1995 Péter Besenyei won 2 gold and 2 silver medals and he was named the most successful aerobatics pilot of his time. In 2001 Besenyei flew upside down under the Széchenyi Chain Bridge, that spans the river Danube in Budapest, a maneuver that became a standard in air races today.|$|R
5000|$|One of Dorothy's {{specialties}} {{during her}} performance was the outside loop, which she learned from Tex Rankin. She {{became the first}} woman to perform this maneuver on June 30, 1930. [...] Later that year at the Omaha Air Show, she set a world record for flying 56 inverted <b>snap</b> <b>rolls</b> as well as 69 consecutive outside loops, 62 of which were deemed perfectly rounded by observers from the National Aeronautic Association (NAA). Her record of 62 outside loops remained unbroken until July 13, 1989, when it was broken at the North Bend (Ore.) Air Show by stunt pilot Joann Osterud. Stenzel had encouraged Osterud to break the record.|$|R
5000|$|Intention: tumble the {{airplane}} continuously with each tumble's plane turned {{relative to the}} previous one. Enter from a near vertical climb then let the airspeed decay to near zero and initiate a <b>snap</b> <b>roll</b> by using full down elevator and, for a clockwise rotating engine, full left rudder. The aircraft will rotate on all three axes and perform three end-over-end negative [...] "g" [...] tumbles, each tumble being at about 45° to {{the plane of the}} last. The maneuver ends when the aircraft runs out of momentum and begins falling with enough speed for the airflow past the control surfaces to stop the tumbling. Neutralising the controls then causes the aircraft to recover nose down.|$|E

5000|$|Even when {{examples}} {{with the}} [...] "B" [...] wings were completed, the safety record {{did not improve}} greatly. Several crashes in the BD-5B {{were found to have}} taken place due to engine failure on takeoff, both due to the mix of [...] "oddball" [...] engines as well as endemic cooling problems. The reason this is such an issue with the BD-5 is twofold [...] - [...] the high line of thrust means an engine failure immediately results in an unexpected (for most pilots) nose-up attitude change. Pilots who fail to fly the aircraft first and then attempt to restart the engine inevitably stall, with the associated consequences. This was aggravated by the fact the original wing had a very sharp stall with little warning and a nasty tendency to <b>snap</b> <b>roll.</b> To make matters worse, a documented manufacturing error in some wing skins delivered to kit builders exacerbated the problem. A rather small center of gravity range added to the problems of properly trimming the aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|Before World War II, most maize in North America was {{harvested}} by hand. This {{involved a}} {{large numbers of}} workers and associated social events (husking or shucking bees). From the 1890s onward, some machinery became available to partially mechanize the processes, such as one- and two-row mechanical pickers (picking the ear, leaving the stover) and corn binders, which are reaper-binders designed specifically for maize (for example, [...] ). The latter produce sheaves that can be shocked. By hand or mechanical picker, the entire ear is harvested, which then requires a separate operation of a maize sheller to remove the kernels from the ear. Whole ears of maize were often stored in corn cribs, and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use. Today corn cribs with whole ears, and corn binders, are less common because most modern farms harvest the grain from the field with a combine and store it in bins. The combine with a corn head (with points and <b>snap</b> <b>rolls</b> instead of a reel) does not cut the stalk; it simply pulls the stalk down.

50|$|Stroud co-starred in Roger Corman’s film Von Richthofen and Brown (1971). Stroud played Roy Brown {{opposite}} John Phillip Law’s Baron von Richthofen.

25|$|Boise State won {{the coin}} toss and opted to play defense first.

5000|$|A high-g {{barrel roll}} is a {{combination}} of a loop and a <b>snap</b> <b>roll.</b> A high g barrel roll is a last-ditch defensive maneuver, performed when the attacker has achieved a suitable guns solution, in order to cause an overshoot. The high-g barrel roll is a violent maneuver which is performed much more aggressively than a normal barrel roll. Range is {{critical to the success of}} the roll, and the defender will usually turn very hard, or employ other measures to draw the opponent very close before performing the roll. The roll is executed by applying hard back-stick pressure, creating the high g-forces, and adding hard rudder input to assist the ailerons in rolling the fighter. A high-g barrel roll can be performed [...] "over-the-top", or it can be performed [...] "underneath", which is accomplished by rolling upside-down and beginning the maneuver from the inverted position. The high-g barrel roll is an energy-depleting maneuver that rarely causes the attacker to fly out in front, but usually will result in a flight path overshoot, a flat scissors, or, at the very least, will temporarily disrupt the attacker's aim.|$|E
