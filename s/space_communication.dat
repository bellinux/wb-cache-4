40|$|Abstract — When every a {{communication}} {{system is to}} be designed whether wireless or wired, {{the first and the}} most important issue which is to be considered is about the features possess by the medium through which communication will take place and whether those features will induce a negative role on it or not. In free <b>space</b> light <b>communication</b> technique, it is clear by the name that the atmosphere is being used as a medium for carrying or transferring data using infrared carrier. Various atmospheric phenomena do play a negative role on light communication and what we term them as attenuation phenomenal. This paper deals with such various phenomena and its negative role on free <b>space</b> light <b>communication</b> technique. Also why IR wave is preferred for free <b>space</b> light <b>communication</b> is also explained.

40|$|Coordination for dynamic task {{allocation}} {{based on}} available resources {{is a very}} challenging research issue in disaster environments with time, <b>space</b> and <b>communication</b> constraints. In addition, the <b>space</b> and <b>communication</b> constraints and the dynamic features of disaster environments make an extra difficulty to achieve efficient coordination through centralised coordination approaches, which require the coordinators to have global knowledge of the environments. To this end, a coordination approach for dynamic weighted task allocation is proposed in this paper. The proposed approach considers time, <b>space</b> and <b>communication</b> constraints in disaster environments and urgent degrees of workloads of tasks without requiring the global knowledge of the environment. In particular, a dynamic group formation mechanism is developed to help agents to form groups and share information for task allocation under <b>space</b> and <b>communication</b> constraints in a decentralised manner, which can reflect real-life situations in disaster environments. The efficient coordination for task allocation is achieved through the utility calculation within each group. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed approach outperforms most of other coordination approaches, such as the group formation approach proposed by Glinton et al. and the heuristics task allocation approach proposed by Ramchurn et al. in terms of group formation and weighted task allocation in disaster environments with time, <b>space</b> and <b>communication</b> constraints...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Free <b>space</b> laser <b>communication</b> (FSOC) {{has been}} an {{emerging}} technology that is deployed in the marine ship communication field for enabling high-quality communications among moving ships due to its high anti-EM interference capability and good security. However, the system typically requires six dimensional supports of Acquisition, tracking and pointing in the moving environment, which is rather expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel four-degree-of-freedom solution based {{on the law of}} motion of the ship in wind waves derived from linear system theory; the solution uses a horizontal, a vertical and two rotating motions to simulate the laser movement caused by ship movement in the wind waves. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first effort in this field; our approach significantly reduces the complexity and cost of the six-dimension based solution. Our experimental results demonstrate a realization of laser movement caused by ship roll movement in the wind waves, and verify the convenience and accuracy of the simulated ship-borne free <b>space</b> optical <b>communication</b> system.
