25|$|Morphine is a {{phenanthrene}} {{opioid receptor}} agonist– its main effect is binding to and activating the μ-opioid receptors {{in the central}} nervous system. Its intrinsic activity at the μ-opioid is heavily dependent on the assay and tissue being tested; in some situations it is a full agonist while in others {{it can be a}} partial agonist or even antagonist. In clinical settings, morphine exerts its principal pharmacological effect on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Activation of the μ-opioid receptors is associated with analgesia, sedation, euphoria, physical dependence, and respiratory depression. Morphine is also a κ-opioid and δ-opioid receptor agonist, κ-opioid's action is associated with <b>spinal</b> <b>analgesia,</b> miosis (pinpoint pupils) and psychotomimetic effects. δ-Opioid is thought {{to play a role in}} analgesia. Although morphine does not bind to the σ-receptor, it has been shown that σ-agonists, such as (+)-pentazocine, inhibit morphine analgesia, and σ-antagonists enhance morphine analgesia, suggesting downstream involvement of the σ-receptor in the actions of morphine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pharmacodynamic}} {{response to}} an opioid depends upon the receptor to which it binds, its affinity for that receptor, and whether the opioid is an agonist or an antagonist. [...] For example, the supraspinal analgesic properties of the opioid agonist morphine are mediated by activation of the μ1 receptor; respiratory depression and physical dependence by the μ2 receptor; and sedation and <b>spinal</b> <b>analgesia</b> by the κ receptor. [...] Each group of opioid receptors elicits a distinct set of neurological responses, with the receptor subtypes (such as μ1 and μ2 for example) providing even more [...] specific responses. [...] Unique to each opioid is its distinct binding affinity to the various classes of opioid receptors (e.g. the μ, κ, and δ opioid receptors are activated at different magnitudes according to the specific receptor binding affinities of the opioid). For example, the opiate alkaloid morphine exhibits high-affinity binding to the μ-opioid receptor, while ketazocine exhibits high affinity to ĸ receptors. [...] It is this combinatorial mechanism that allows for such a wide class of opioids and molecular designs to exist, {{each with its own}} unique effect profile. Their individual molecular structure is also responsible for their different duration of action, whereby metabolic breakdown (such as N-dealkylation) is responsible for opioid metabolism.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Combined <b>spinal</b> {{epidural}} <b>analgesia</b> {{is effective}} for fast relief of severe labour pain {{but has been}} associated with worrisome decreases in fetal heart rate. Since the reasons for this phenomenon remain elusive, some anaesthesiologists may abstain from using this technique. We postulated that factors unrelated to the neuraxial technique could {{play a role in the}} decrease in fetal heart rate. To our knowledge, no prospective study has previously looked into this possibility. METHODS: We collected prospective data on 223 consecutive patients who received combined <b>spinal</b> epidural <b>analgesia</b> (123) or epidural analgesia (100). Maternal blood pressure, analogue pain scores, exogenous infusion of oxytocin, cervical dilatation, maternal age, parity and ethnicity were collected and correlated with the occurrence of decreases in fetal heart rate post combined spinal epidural. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed a correlation between the incidence of fetal bradycardia and higher maternal pain scores, older maternal age, and combined <b>spinal</b> epidural <b>analgesia.</b> Multivariate analysis revealed that only pain scores and maternal age were independent predictors of fetal bradycardia post neuraxial blockade.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The use of {{intraoperative}} multimodal analgesia {{has clearly}} improved postoperative pain control, mortality and morbidity after major surgical procedures. However, very few clinical trials {{have studied the}} longterm impact of intraoperative epidural or <b>spinal</b> <b>analgesia</b> on chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) development. Even less studies have evaluated the modulatory effect of intraoperative neuraxial analgesia on objective changes (i. e. mechanical hyperalgesia) reflecting central sensitization. METHODS: The present work compares general anesthesia alone (GA group) versus general anesthesia combined to either intraoperative epidural analgesia (EPID group: combination of bupicavaine, sufentanil and clonidine 1 microg/kg) or <b>spinal</b> <b>analgesia</b> (IT group: either bupivacaine or clonidine 300 microg) {{on the development of}} secondary mechanical hyperalgesia and the incidence of CPSP after major abdominal surgery. Data analyzed in the present work involve adult patients undergoing surgical resection of rectal adenocarcinoma who participated in three previously published randomized trials. RESULTS: Intraoperative epidural and particularly <b>spinal</b> <b>analgesia</b> reduced both incidence (p < 0. 05 between GA alone and <b>spinal</b> <b>analgesia)</b> and extent (area) of secondary mechanical hyperalgesia surrounding the wound at 48 h and 72 h after surgery.

Fifteen minutes after spinal injection, 10 mL of study solution was administered epidurally. The study solution was plain saline or neostigmine 500 microg combined with clonidine 75 microg. Outcome parameters were {{duration of}} <b>spinal</b> <b>analgesia,</b> local anaesthetic consumption and number of patients delivering without additional epidural analgesia. RESULTS: Epidural clonidine and neostigmine significantly prolonged initial analgesia: 144 (105 - 163) min vs. 95 (70 - 120) min {{in the placebo group}} and reduced hourly ropivacaine consumption: 7. 5 (3. 0 - 11. 9) mg vs. 12. 7 (9. 6 - 16. 9) mg. More patients in the experimental group delivered before the first request for additional analgesia (9 vs. 2). CONCLUSION: Epidural administration of neostigmine 500 microg and clonidine 75 microg, following the intrathecal injection of ropivacaine and sufentanil, prolongs analgesia and reduces hourly ropivacaine consumption. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Question: Can {{differences}} in Australian birth intervention rates {{be explained by}} women's residence {{at the time of}} childbearing?. Methods: Data were collected prospectively via surveys in 1996, 2000, 2003, 2006 and 2009 from women, born between 1973 and 1978, of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. Analysis included data from 5886 women who had given birth to their first child between 1994 and 2009. Outcome measures were self-report of birth interventions: pharmacological pain relief (epidural and <b>spinal</b> block <b>analgesia,</b> inhalational analgesia and intramuscular injections), surgical births (an elective or emergency caesarean section) and instrumental births (forceps and ventouse). Findings: Primiparous women residing in non-metropolitan areas of Australia experienced fewer birth interventions than women residing in metropolitan areas: 43 % versus 56 % received epidural analgesia; 8 % versus 11 % had elective caesarean sections; and 16 % versus 18 % had emergency caesarean sections. Differences in maternal age and private health insurance status at first birth accounted for {{differences in}} surgical birth rates but did not fully explain differences in epidural analgesia. Conclusion: Non-metropolitan women had fewer birth interventions, particularly epidural analgesia, than metropolitan women. Differences in maternal age and private health insurance do not fully explain the differences in epidural analgesia rates, suggesting care provided to labouring women may differ by area of residence. The difference in epidural analgesia rates may be due to lack of choice in maternity services, however it could also be due to differing expectations leading to differences in birth interventions for primiparous women living in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The aims of {{the present}} study were (1) to {{investigate}} if a disposable patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device can be used for labor analgesia and (2) to evaluate the device by midwives and parturients. METHODS: Forty healthy parturients were divided into two groups and received combined <b>spinal</b> epidural <b>analgesia</b> for labor pain relief. Following intrathecal administration of 3 mg ropivacaine and 1. 5 microg sufentanil, either a disposable PCA device (Coopdech Syrinjector; Daiken Medical, Osaka, Japan) or an electronic PCA device (IVAC PCAM PCA Syringe Pump; Alaris, Basingstoke, UK) was connected to the epidural catheter, and 0. 15 % ropivacaine with sufentanil 0. 75 microg/ml was used for continuous infusion and PCA. For an electronic PCA device, continuous infusion rate, bolus dose, lockout time, and hourly limit were set at 4 ml/h, 3 ml, 15 min, and 16 ml, respectively. For a disposable PCA device, continuous infusion rate, bolus dose, and an hourly limit were set at 4 ml/h, 3 ml, and 16 ml, respectively, but lockout function was not available. RESULTS: No differences were observed between the groups concerning demographic data, obstetric data, and outcome of labor. Anesthetic requirements (disposable, 9. 7 +/- 4. 7 ml/h; electronic, 8. 2 +/- 4. 0 ml/h) and VAS score during the delivery (disposable, 26 +/- 25; electronic, 21 +/- 22) were similar between the groups. Midwives praised the disposable PCA device as well as the electronic one. CONCLUSION: The present results imply that the disposable PCA device can be an alternative to the electronic PCA device for labor analgesia. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Intrathecal (IT) {{magnesium}} has antinociceptive {{effects on}} animals {{and has been}} reported to prolong <b>spinal</b> opioid <b>analgesia</b> in humans. This study examined the effect of IT magnesium on spinal anesthesia and postoperative epidural analgesia. Methods: Sixty patients undergoing total knee replacement were enrolled in this study. Before the IT injection of 0. 5 % isobaric tetracaine (10 mg), group C and group M received 0. 9 % saline or 50 % magnesium sulfate 0. 1 ml, respectively. The epidural solution for postoperative analgesia contained 0. 2 % ropivacaine (100 ml) only in group M, and 0. 2 % ropivacaine plus morphine (50 μg/ml) in group C. The verbal rating scale (VRS) scores for pain, sensory block level, intensity of motor block and side effects were recorded at 5, 60, and 120 minutes after the IT injection and at 1, 12 and 36 hours after surgery in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Results: The VRS score at 120 minutes after the IT injection were lower in group M than in group C (P ＜ 0. 05). There were no differences in the VRS scores and the use of supplemental analgesics at the postoperative period. The incidence of PONV, pruritus and urinary retention was significantly lower in group M than in group C at 12 and 36 hours after surgery. Conclusions: IT magnesium {{can be used as a}} local anesthetic adjuvant to strengthen the analgesic effect of spinal local anesthesia and to intensify the analgesic effect of epidural local anesthesia for postoperative pain control to the extent of 5 mg epidura...|$|R
