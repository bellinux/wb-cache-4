Centuries-long development dynamics {{within the framework of the}} Mediterranean polycultural production has been seriously disrupted by the deagrarianism and an intensive emigration. It has considerably weakened the demographic basis, which is the main factor of the socio-economic development. In the recent half-century period the way of life has changed radically, which, among other things, manifested also in the changes of island (rural) landscape. Arable areas are fewer and fewer, <b>social</b> <b>fallow</b> dominates, and the physiognomy of the only island settlement has also significantly changed. The appearance and functions of a traditional Mediterranean island settlement have been replaced by an urbanely nuanced "spatial mechanism", where newbuilt weekend houses and renewed old village homes, primarily intended for rest and recreation, have predominant importance...|$|E

The base for integral observation and treatment of the urban and rural settlements, within the local administrative area, has been set thereby. The current function of villages has been significantly changed regarding traditional organization and the essential role, {{that they used to}} have in the past. First of all, it is a consequence of an intensive deagrarization and industrialization/ urbanization, as a result of official (state) strategy {{in the middle of the}} 20. century. As a rule, these processes were painful for villages, leaving them depopulized, with varied age structure of the population and with new relation to agriculture, which led to economic stagnation, <b>social</b> <b>fallow</b> and unclear development perspectives as a consequence. The reconstruction of these areas is, therefore, of enormous interest for development of the whole territory of a community, as well as even intra-communal and broader, intra-regional and intra-national development...|$|E

The size of the study population increased in the period 1982 - 1983 and remained relatively stable from 1983 to 1988 (mean = 267. 79 + 11. 26). The mean group size of the female groups was the largest (8. 67 + 1. 44); mixed groups showed a mean size of 8. 09 (± 1. 05), the mean group size of the male ones being the smallest (5. 21 ± 0. 9). The results indicate that density as well as temperature during the last month of gestation have repercussions on the reproductive performance of the females. No sexual differences have been detected in juvenile mortality {{during the first year}} of life...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{aspects of}} hunting in later medieval Ireland, with particular {{reference to the}} Anglo-Norman period, from 1169 to c. 1350. The focus is on deer hunting and on parks, in which fallow deer could be kept. To date no detailed study of hunting in high medieval Ireland has been carried out, {{and as a result}} the study uses an interdisciplinary approach in order to maximise the scope of coverage. The aim of this thesis is to understand how parks and deer hunting were used to create and maintain identities, and how these functioned as a form of social and cultural expression in high medieval Ireland. Deer hunting was central to elite society, having symbolic significance, as well as developing military skills and forging <b>social</b> bonds. <b>Fallow</b> deer were unusual, but not rare in later medieval Ireland. They were limited to the east of the country and to the highest tier of Anglo-Norman lordly society, being relatively common finds from castle excavations. Notably, the evidence suggests that the bones of all species of wild mammals are much less frequently found on Irish castle sites than on English elite sites. The study identifies thirty-nine documented high medieval parks, and includes detailed examination of five of these. All thirty-nine were in Anglo-Norman areas, with no high medieval parks found in Gaelic Ireland. Today, the parks have been forgotten, however survey has shown that physical features do survive at the sites of many of those surveyed. Parks were integral to Anglo-Norman identity, being used {{to create a sense of}} place and familiarity in a foreign land. Unlike England, however, they did not become widespread, and few were stocked with deer. 2018 - 05 - 1...|$|R
40|$|The cluster {{development}} {{method is}} one of the successful developing methods in agricultural industries section and small industries, which is based on communication and creation cooperation network between cluster beneficiaries by increasing the social capital. In this research the data were collected by using census two stage survey from olive industrial units in mentioned geographical zone(North Iran) in 2007. The results of this research showed that the social capital in some of beneficiaries groups is weak and brittle, but because of their statements there is background of cooperation and increase of their social capital. After recognition and strengthening the effective factors on increase of social capital, can prepare the background for developing of new connective and informative technologies. Naturally economic discompetition of units, diseconomies of scale, negative competition in industry and the other problems which are investigated in the olive industrial cluster is resulting from the lack of information and connection between cluster actives. The aim of industrial cluster method is increasing the cooperation network between cluster members by increasing the communication and information which by increase in using information and communication technology will <b>fallow</b> <b>social</b> capital and then industrial cluster development method...|$|R

Çalışma, internet yayıncılığının interaktif yapısı sayesinde, kullanıcılar ile girdiği etkileşim sonucu ortaya çıkan sonuçları konu almaktadır. Bu çalışma kapsamında Ahsen TV isimli internet üzerinden yayıncılık yapan kuruluşun derlediği sokak röportajları incelenecek, röportaj içeriklerinin başlık ve açıklamalar ile tutarlılığı irdelenecektir. Ahsen TV isimli kuruluşun internet sitesinde sokak röportajlarının yanı sıra farklı içerikler bulunsa da, bu içerikler çalışmaya dahil edilmemiştir. Sokak röportajlarının incelenmesi bağlamında yapısal çözümleme yöntemi ile başlık ve açıklamada vaat edilen unsurların içerik ile ne ölçüde örtüştüğü analiz edilecektir. Analizler sonucunda ortaya çıkacak olası bulgu, Ahsen TV’nin web sitesinde bulunan sokak röportajlarından, web sitesini takip eden kişiler tarafından favoriye alınmış siyasi içerikli olanlar üzerinden propaganda yapıldığıdır. Amaç, analizler sonucunda ortaya çıkan verilerde, tutarlılığı düşük olarak saptanan videolarda bulunan provokatif unsurların, propagandist bir nitelik taşıdığını ortaya koymaktır. There {{have been}} several studies concerning media and propaganda, however there are no sufficient studies about Internet publishing and propaganda. This study focuses {{on the results of}} the interaction between Internet and its users on account of Internet’s interactive structure. Within this study, the street interviews compiled by Ahsen TV, which is an Internet publishing establishment will be examined and the consistency between the name, explanation and the content of the street interviews will be analyzed. In this context, by using the structural analysis method, it will be examined how cohered the elements that are promised in the name and the explanation of the videos with the content, in the video. The possible findings {{as a result of the}} analysis is, a political propaganda is being made by the street interview videos that are being published on Ahsen TV’s website, which are chosen as favorites by the followers of the website that contain political contents. The aim is to put forth that the provocative elements in the videos that have low consistency, also contain propagandist quality. In the past, media organs such as newspapers, journals, radio, television etc. were being used to broadcast information to the masses; however nowadays, with the progress of technology, the information can reach to larger masses and faster than it used to be. Internet access allowed people to engage with the information both actively and passively, thus carried news reporting to an interactive platform. The unifying power of Internet publishing allowed different mediums such as newspapers, journals, radio and television to be accumulated in one platform and let the information spread to different places by linking the masses together. Within the concept of Internet journalism, some contents that were not published in any kind of medium could partake as well as the online version of printed journals/newspapers. It can be seen that the reader could interact with the news by carrying the printed journals/newspapers on an online platform. In this case, the reader’s status is changed from a one-sided participation to an interactive attendance. It is possible to reach the information, created by Internet journalism from every environment that contains Internet connection, as opposed to printed journalism. Because of the limited page numbers, the printed journalism can only advert to the issues that the general reader population might concern; on the other hand, because the Internet journalism has no page number limitation, the contents got to be more personalized. The printed journalism is limited as local, regional or national, but the Internet journalism eliminated this separation. By transferring printed journalism to Internet journalism the reader/participant could take an active part on news production and content output. However this situation brought up the ethic questions as well, because with the interactive participation of the user, the production of news/contents could get more personalized instead of more professional. Producing unproven news, personalized contents, and inconsistency of the headline with the content could cause some ethical problems alongside with propaganda and provocation. The contents, which are unethical and/or provocative, could be used as a propaganda tool under the name of journalism. The relationship between propaganda and news that the masses don’t usually distinguish coincides with the aim of the groups who wanted to make propaganda, because the propaganda, which is being perceived as news, achieves its goals faster. With the development of media and the increase of technological facilities, both the quality and quantity of propaganda has changed. Evolution of technology and increment of Internet connection let more people to make propaganda via Internet broadcasting. Propagandas over media can turn into a provocative content that incites individuals or groups. The interactive environment on Internet publishing can become a suitable place for propaganda and provocation and can reduce propaganda making to individuals. By the conversion of reader, listener or spectator into a participant, propaganda can be made on the people who are exposed to the provocative content thus, unethical productions can be created. Within this study, unethical, propagandist and provocative elements in the street interviews that are politically motivated which are picked as favorites on the website of the establishment called “Ahsen TV” are determined and it is examined if there is a propaganda making or not in the videos within Ahsen TV. In this research the consistency between Ahsen TV’s street interview’s headlines and explanations are examined. This study is limited with Ahsen TV, which is broadcasting online. In this study, the videos on the website of Ahsen TV that are in the section of street interviews which were chosen as favorites were used. For the study, 12 videos that contain political headlines were chosen out of 37 videos that were chosen as favorites. The hypothesis of this study is that people via various Internet channels or <b>social</b> networks are <b>fallowing</b> Ahsen TV. Ahsen TV is the chosen sample out of online broadcasting establishments for this study. In this study, the headlines and explanations of politically entitled street interviews on Ahsen TV are going to be analyzed by structural analysis...|$|R
