5|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on changes of anthropometrical (body weight, BMI, WHR,…) or {{biochemical}} parameters (mostly plasma lipid levels) {{as a result of the}} interactions between common APOA5 variants and dietary habits (polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, n-3 and n-6 fatty acid intake, total fat and total energy intake, alcohol intake), dietary (lowering the energy intake) and/or physical activity interventions or dyslipidaemic (using statins or fenofibrate) treatment. Due to the high heterogeneity of the examined populations, differences in protocol and/or interventions used, the studies are difficult to directly compare and draw definitive conclusions. However, with caution, it could be concluded that carriers of the minor C-1131, Trp19, or T553 alleles are in some cases less prone to the positive effects of environmental and/or pharmacological interventions. Some papers suggest the importance of the interactions between APOA5 and other genes, especially with common APOE (OMIM acc. No. 107741) three allelic (E2, E3, and E4) polymorphism, in the modulation of plasma lipids. In these cases, the interaction between minor alleles of both genes seems to be of importance. In the general population, APOE4 <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> potential to diminish the effect of minor APOA5 rs662799 and rs3135506 alleles, especially in females. Interaction between APOE and APOA5 Ser19˃Trp has been suggested to play some role in the development of type III hyperlipidaemia. Further studies, in which interaction with APOA5 has been described, have included, for example, variants within FTO, lipoprotein lipase, USF-1 and FEN-1. They have also focused not only on plasma lipids, but on BMI values or hypertension as well.|$|E

25|$|REM atonia, {{an almost}} {{complete}} paralysis of the body, is accomplished through the inhibition of motor neurons. When the body shifts into REM sleep, motor neurons {{throughout the body}} undergo a process called hyperpolarization: their already-negative membrane potential decreases by another 2–10 millivolts, thereby raising the threshold which a stimulus must overcome to excite them. Muscle inhibition may result from unavailability of monoamine neurotransmitters (restraining the abundance of acetylcholine in the brainstem) and perhaps from mechanisms used in waking muscle inhibition. The medulla oblongata, located between pons and spine, <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> capacity for organism-wide muscle inhibition. Some localized twitching and reflexes can still occur. Pupils contract.|$|E
25|$|Mansa Mahmud III's reign ended around 1559. There {{seems to}} have been either a vacancy or unknown ruler between 1559 and the start of the last mansas reign. A vacancy or rule by a court {{official}} seems the most likely, since the next ruler takes the name of Mahmud IV. By 1560, the once powerful empire was not much more than the core of the Manden Kurufaba. The next notable mansa, Mahmud IV, doesn’t appear in any records {{until the end of the}} 16th century. However, he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> distinction of being the last ruler of a unified Manden. His descendants are blamed for the breakup of the Manden Kurufaba into north, central and southern realms.|$|E
25|$|One {{area where}} hypersegregation <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> {{greatest}} effect is in violence experienced by residents. The number of violent {{crimes in the}} U.S. in general has fallen. The number of murders in the U.S. fell 9% from the 1980s to the 1990s. Despite this number, the crime rates in the hypersegregated inner-cities of America are rising. As of 1993, young African-American men are eleven {{times more likely to}} be shot to death and nine {{times more likely to be}} murdered than their European American peers. Poverty, high unemployment, and broken families, all factors more prevalent in hypersegregated inner-cities, all contribute significantly to the unequal levels of violence experienced by African-Americans. Research has proven that the more segregated the surrounding European American suburban ring is, the rate of violent crime in the inner-city will rise, but, likewise, crime in the outer area will drop.|$|E

500|$|That convention, in May 1776, {{unanimously}} instructed Jefferson {{and other}} Virginia delegates to Congress to seek [...] "a clear and full Declaration of Independency". At the same time, the convention resolved {{to pass a}} declaration of rights. Due to ill-health, Mason did not arrive until May 18, 1776, after the vote, but was appointed to a committee led by Archibald Cary, which was to compose a declaration of rights and constitution. Mason was skeptical that the thirty-person Cary Committee could collectively compose anything worthwhile, but {{was surprised at how}} quickly it moved—though his membership had a role in that speed.

She is a familiar character from the teen drama: popular, a cheerleader, the center of cliques (power as status). Furthermore, Cordelia's exceptionalism is based on 'real' material privilege rather than supernatural power. She represents in more exaggerated form the unnamed white middle-class heterosexual qualities (read privilege) of the other characters (to {{the point that it}} becomes visible)." [...] Elizabeth Rambo notes how Cordelia's status is highlighted by her nickname, [...] "Queen C", and Harmony's remark to her, [...] "Cordy, you reign." [...] Cordelia functions recognizably as the typical female victim of horror, often screaming and running away, and this makes her a perfect contrast for other female characters." ...|$|E

Richard Corliss of Time and David Ansen of Newsweek praised it, as did Vincent Canby of The New York Times. [...] "Though it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> manner of some magically reconstituted B-movie of an earlier era, The Last Crusade is an endearing original," [...] Canby wrote, deeming the revelation Indiana had a father who was not proud of {{him to be a}} [...] "comic surprise". Canby {{believed}} that while the film did not match the previous two in its pacing, it still had [...] "hilariously off-the-wall sequences" [...] such as the circus train chase. He also said that Spielberg was maturing by focusing on the father–son relationship, a call echoed by McBride in Variety. Roger Ebert praised the scene depicting Indiana as a Boy Scout with the Cross of Coronado; he compared it to the [...] "style of illustration that appeared in the boys' adventure magazines of the 1940s", saying that Spielberg [...] "must have been paging through his old issues of Boys' Life magazine... the feeling that you can stumble over astounding adventures just by going on a hike with your Scout troop. Spielberg lights the scene in the strong, basic colors of old pulp magazines." [...] The Hollywood Reporter felt Connery and Ford deserved Academy Award nominations.|$|E
