50|$|Small {{satellites}} can use conventional radio {{systems in}} UHF, VHF, S-band and X-band, although often miniaturized using more up-to-date technology {{as compared to}} larger satellites. Tiny satellites such as nanosats and small microsats may lack the power supply or mass for large conventional radio transponders, and various miniaturized or innovative communications systems have been proposed, such as laser receivers, antenna arrays and <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> communication networks. Few of these have been demonstrated in practice.|$|E

5000|$|Secure {{communications}} {{have been}} proposed using a laser N-slit interferometer where the laser signal {{takes the form of}} an interferometric pattern. Any attempt to intercept the signal causes the collapse of the interferometric pattern. [...] This technique has been demonstrated to work over propagation distances of practical interest and, in principle, it could be applied over large distances in space. [...] Assuming available laser technology, and considering the divergence of the interferometric signals, the range for <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> communications has been estimated to be approximately 2000 km. [...] These estimates are applicable to an array of satellites orbiting the Earth. For space vehicles or space stations, the range of communications is estimated to increase up to 10000 km. [...] This approach to secure space-to-space communications was selected by Laser Focus World {{as one of the top}} photonics developments of 2015.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Geos 3 /ATS 6 <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> {{tracking}} experiment was to develop, test, and evaluate methods of deriving orbit estimates from <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking data. The results of the form of conventional orbit overlap tests, and a comparison of a Geos 3 orbit estimate obtained from <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> (SST) tracking data with an orbit estimate derived form C-band data. The method recommeded for estimating orbits from SST data is a Bayesian least squares procedure utilizing independent ranging to the relay satellite...|$|E

NASA intends {{to use the}} tracking data relay satellite system for operational orbit determination of NASA satellites. Hence, in the near future, <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking data will be routinely processed to obtain orbits. The <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking system used in the ATS- 6 /Nimbus- 6 and ATS- 6 /GEOS- 3 experiments performed with a resolution of 1 to 2 m in range and less than 1 mm/s in range rate for a 10 -s averaging. A Bayesian least squares estimation technique utilizing independent ranging to the synchronous relay satellite {{was determined to be}} the most effective procedure for estimating orbits from <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking data. The use of this technique yields estimates of user satellite orbits which are comparable in accuracy to what is usually obtained from ground based systems...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{simulations}} {{have demonstrated}} the applicability of <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking data to the related problems of orbit determination and geopotential recovery. Specifically, <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking between an earth orbiting satellite and a satellite at geosynchronous altitude (36000 km) produces long continuous data arcs which are not available by means of ground-based tracking. This facility, in conjunction with correct estimation techniques, yields exceptional orbit determination accuracy. The data type also has considerable applicability to geopotential determination when the low satellite has a high inclination...|$|E
40|$|The {{uncertainty}} in relay satellite sate {{is a significant}} error source which cannot be ignored in the reduction of <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking data. Based on simulations and real data reductions, it is numerically impractical to use simultaneous unconstrained solutions to determine both relay and user satellite epoch states. A Bayesian or least squares estimation technique with an a priori procedure is presented which permits the adjustment of relay satellite epoch state in the reduction of <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking data without the numerical difficulties introduced by an ill-conditioned normal matrix...|$|E
40|$|<b>Satellite-to-satellite</b> {{tracking}} and orbit computation accuracy is evaluated {{on the basis}} of data obtained from near earth spacecraft via the geostationary ATS- 6. The near earth spacecraft involved are Apollo-Soyuz, GEOS- 3, and NIMBUS- 6. In addition ATS- 6 is being tracked by a new scheme wherein a single ground transmitter interrogates several ground based transponders via ATS- 6 to achieve the precision geostationary orbits essential in <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> orbit computation. Also one way Doppler data is being recorded aboard NIMBUS- 6 to determine the position of meteorological platforms. Accuracy assessments associated with the foregoing mission related experiments are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Current {{knowledge}} {{concerning the}} earth's gravity field {{is limited to}} about 1500 - 2000 km resolution. However, the resolution of gravity anomalies having a spatial extent of 100 - 1000 km over the entire globe is needed for important geophysical and geodetic applications. In the near future satellite altimetry {{will be used to}} determine the ocean geoid at the 10 cm - 1 m level. In order to provide a similar level of resolutions over the land regions, there exists a need for utilizing new promising techniques such as gravity gradiometry and new radiometric measurements, viz., <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking. <b>Satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking techniques have shown potential for improving the medium wavelength component of the gravity field. The gravity gradiometer has not yet been tested on board a satellite. The reported analysis includes a simplified theoretical model to compare the effectiveness of the gradiometer measurements and radiometric measurements for high resolution gravity field determination, and the direct estimation of local gravity anomalies represented by point masses using a simulated gravity gradiometer and <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking data...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of what resolution of the gravity field {{can be obtained from}} <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> Doppler tracking was investigated by performing least-squares adjustments of simulated Doppler data, solving for parameters describing the anomalous gravity field in various sized blocks. By examining the correlation between the adjusted parameters describing neighboring blocks, it was possible to judge whether a given set of data was capable of resolving blocks of a given size. Two concepts of <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking are considered: the first involves two satellites near together in very low orbits, while the second uses geostationary satellites to track a single very low satellite. In either case, blocks 500 km on a side can be satisfactorily resolved from an orbital altitude of 700 km. From an altitude of 200 km, blocks 200 km on a side can be resolved. Because of the lower limit on altitude imposed by the presence of the earth's atmosphere, it does not appear that <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> Doppler tracking will be able to resolve features smaller than 200 km on a side...|$|E
40|$|Satellite {{altitude}} determination uncertainties {{are discussed}} {{from the standpoint}} of the GEOS-C satellite. GEOS-C will be tracked by a number of the conventional satellite tracking systems, as well as by two advanced systems; a <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking system and lasers capable of decimeter accuracies which are being developed in connection with the Goddard Earth and Ocean Dynamics Applications program. The discussion is organized in terms of a specific type of GEOS-C orbit which would satisfy a number of scientific objectives including the study of the gravitational field by means of both the altimeter and the <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking system, studies of tides, and the Gulf Stream meanders...|$|E
40|$|For the {{determination}} of the earth" s gravity field many types of observations are available nowadays, e. g., terrestrial gravimetry, airborne gravimetry, <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking, satellite gradiometry etc. The mathematical connection between these observables {{on the one hand and}} gravity field and shape of the earth on the other hand, is called the integrated concept of physical geodesy. In this paper harmonic wavelets are introduced by which the gravitational part of the gravity field can be approximated progressively better and better, reflecting an increasing flow of observations. An integrated concept of physical geodesy in terms of harmonic wavelets is presented. Essential tools for approximation are integration formulas relating an integral over an internal sphere to suitable linear combinations of observation functionals, i. e., linear functionals representing the geodetic observables. A scale discrete version of multiresolution is described for approximating the gravitational potential outside and on the earth" s surface. Furthermore, an exact fully discrete wavelet approximation is developed for the case of band-limited wavelets. A method for combined global outer harmonic and local harmonic wavelet modelling is proposed corresponding to realistic earth" s models. As examples, the role of wavelets is discussed for the classical Stokes problem, the oblique derivative problem, <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking, satellite gravity gradiometry, and combined <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking and gradiometry...|$|E

40|$|The Doppler {{tracking}} {{experiment was}} designed to test the feasibility of improved mapping of the earth's gravity field by the low-low <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking method and to observe variations in the electron density of the ionosphere between the two spacecraft. Data were taken between 1 : 01 and 14 : 37 GMT on July 24, 1975. Baseline data taken earlier, while the docking module was still attached to the command and service module, indicated that the equipment operated satisfactorily. The ionospheric data contained in {{the difference between the}} Doppler signals at the two frequencies are of excellent quality, resulting in valuable <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> observations, never made before, of wave phenomena in the ionosphere. The gravity data were corrupted by an unexpectedly high noise level of as-yet-undetermined origin, with periods greater than 150 seconds, that prevented unambiguous identification of gravity-anomaly signatures...|$|E
40|$|The Gravimetric Geodesy Investigation {{which will}} utilize {{altimeter}} and <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking data from GEOS-C, ATS-F, and other spacecraft as appropriate {{to improve our}} knowledge of the earth's gravitational field is discussed. This investigation is interrelated with the study of oceanographic phenomena such as those associated with tides and currents, hence the latter are considered together with gravitational effects in the analysis of the data. The oceanographic effects, each of the order of a meter or two in amplitude and with still smaller uncertainties does not seriously hamper the altimeter gravimetric studies at the five meter level. Laser and <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking data, when combined with the altimeter results, should provide the basis for such studies over wide areas of the ocean surface. Laser and conventional geodetic tracking data from ISAGEX and succeeding campaigns will provide a valuable framework for these analyses...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is the gravity field recovery using <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking methods. Based on new technologies like the global positioning system and accelerometers <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking yields a dramatic improvement in the de- termination of the Earth gravity field. Two dedicated satellite missions, namely the CHAllenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) and the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) are underway. This work describes the processing of the satel- lite data from CHAMP and GRACE based on the energy balance approach. The first part discusses the global gravity field recovery from CHAMP. Specifically, it aims at a reprocessing of kinematic position data and at a refinement of the data processing strategies. Although the energy balance approach is theoretically simple, its imple- mentation proved to be quite challenging. By refining the processing techniques an improvement of up to 30 % is reached for the low degree spherical harmonic coefficients. Nevertheless, the solutions still depend strongly on the variability of the groundtrack. The quality of the monthly solutions can vary up to one order of magnitude. To ad- dress this challenge, an in-depth analysis gives new insight into the phenomenon, and a new and unique combination method with GRACE data is presented, which yields a more homogeneous set of solutions and reaches {{the edge of the}} recoverability of a time-variable gravity signal from high-low <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking missions. In the second part the energy balance approach is applied to the GRACE mission. Pre- vious attempts of expressing the kinetic energy in terms of the K-band measurement make use of an approximation. In this work, an exact representation is introduced and is validated by simulations. In the third part, the aim is to make optimal usage of the data distribution in the high latitude area. For this, interpolation and downward continuation techniques are investigated and an improvement, compared to the global solutions, is achieved. Overall, the analysis provides new and valuable insight into the data processing of <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking data using the energy balance approach...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{accuracy}} of the dynamical model used in the orbit determination of the Lagrangian navigation satellites, the nonlinear perturbations acting on Lagrangian navigation satellites are estimated by a neural network. A neural network based state observer is applied to autonomously determine the orbits of Lagrangian navigation satellites using only <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> range. This autonomous orbit determination method does not require linearizing the dynamical mode. There is no need to calculate the transition matrix. It is proved that three <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> ranges are needed using this method; therefore, the navigation constellation should include four Lagrangian navigation satellites at least. Four satellites orbiting on the collinear libration orbits are chosen to construct a constellation which is used to demonstrate the utility of this method. Simulation results illustrate that the stable error of autonomous orbit determination is about 10 [*]m. The perturbation can be estimated by the neural network...|$|E
40|$|Ionospheric {{range and}} range rate {{corrections}} in <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking were investigated and {{the magnitude of}} errors {{that have to be}} considered for communications between satellites and related experiments was defined. The major causes of the sudden and sometimes large variations apparent in the ionospheric range and range rate corrections along the satellite arc are the geometric effects of the raypath and the curved ionosphere, and the localized perturbations in electron density along the <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> line of sight. Ionospheric tracking errors are greatly effected by the following parameters, whose influence was thoroughly investigated: satellite height, height of maximum electron density, localized ionospheric perturbations and gradients, and electron density variations with diurnal, day-to-day, seasonal, and solar cycle patterns. The results point to the need of using a sophisticated modeling approach incorporating daily solar data, and where possible actual ionospheric measurements as update information. Simulations were performed for satellites at various heights: Apollo, Geos, and Nimbus tracked by ATS- 6; and in two different geometric configurations: coplanar and perpendicular orbits...|$|E
40|$|Satellite laser ranging, {{satellite}} altimetry, {{and improved}} measurements of surface gravitational anomalies have broadened the data base on intermediate and short wavelength {{regions of the}} earth gravity field. The global data set served to develop new geopotential models with a resolution in spherical harmonics out to degree 180. The resolution was made possible using Seasat altimetry data containing 56, 761 values of 1 x 1 deg gravity anomalies. <b>Satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking techniques involving the Geos- 3 and Apollo spacecraft data for the sea surface temperature have yielded accurate intermediate wavelength gravity variations which correlate well with residual depth anomalies. Oceanic gravity anomalies have been computed directly from satellite altimetry or through statistical estimation using oceanic geoid heights. The data sets for gravimetric geoids have been compared with altimetric surfaces to identify areas which were of interest for geophysical investigation. Future data sets could become available from a proposed <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> Doppler tracking system (Gravsat) launched by NASA...|$|E

This demodulator is {{compared with the}} threshold demodulator currently in use, and the two demodulators are shown to have identical performance {{in the absence of}} background noise. The delta-max demodulator is found to outperform the threshold demodulator as the intensity of background noise increases...|$|E
40|$|The J-Adaptive {{estimator}} {{described by}} Jazwinski and Hipkins (1972) is extended {{to include the}} simultaneous estimation of the statistics of the unmodeled system accelerations. With the aid of simulations it is demonstrated that the J-Adaptive estimator with estimated noise statistics can automatically estimate satellite orbits to an accuracy comparable with the data noise levels, when excellent, continuous tracking coverage is available. Such tracking coverage will be available from <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> tracking...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the ATS-F/Nimbus-E tracking experiment, {{the first of its}} kind, is presented. Specifically, this experiment has a twofold purpose: first, to gain experience in the practical use of <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> range and range rate data for very accurate orbit determination (this was its original intent); and second, to evaluate the real usefulness of such a technique for geodetic studies {{despite the fact that the}} 1000 -km Nimbus orbit is not ideally suited for such a purpose. The accuracies of the tracking systems of the <b>satellite-to-satellite</b> and satellite-to-ground link (ATS-F to the Rosman, N. C. ground station) will be about 0. 035 cm/sec in range rate and about 1 m in range - utilizing a 10 sec integration time. With these values it is possible to obtain, based upon performed error analyses, orbit height errors of the order of 0. 1 to 0. 3 m for the near earth orbiting Nimbus spacecraft. This experiment will therefore hopefully prove to be a significant first step for future earth applications spacecraft carrying altimeters systems for measuring ocean height variations...|$|E
