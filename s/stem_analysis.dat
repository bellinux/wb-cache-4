Untreated data of <b>stem</b> <b>analysis</b> consist of annual ring count and measurement procedures performed on cross sections taken from individual tree by section method. The evaluation of obtained this untreated data takes quite some time. Thus, a computer software was developed in this study to quickly and efficiently perform <b>stem</b> <b>analysis.</b> This computer software developed to evaluate untreated data of <b>stem</b> <b>analysis</b> as numerical and graphical was programmed as macro by utilizing Visual Basic for Application feature of MS Excel 2013 program currently the most widely used.

This calculated values are given as table. Development of diameter, height, volume, increments of these variables, volume increment percent and stem form factor at breast height according to periodic age are given as chart.

40|$|This work {{aimed at}} {{comparing}} volume estimates with bark, obtained with equations originated from {{data of the}} stem measurements with bark and <b>stem</b> <b>analysis</b> without bark, respectively. The base of information {{for the development of}} this study was obtained in forest of Pinus taeda L. in the municipal district of Ponte Alta do Norte, Santa Catarina, being composed by two hundred and forty trees measured with bark in different ages, which were selected aleatorily and distributed by diameter class. Another source of data was obtained with the <b>stem</b> <b>analysis</b> without bark of thirty sample trees, distributed among averages and dominant. Mathematical models were tested for each source of data, in order to select the one of better adjustment and precision, with base in the selection criterion of the Score Pondered Value of the Statistical Parameters (VP). The result of VP revealed the equation of Schumacher-Hall as the most appropriated one in the estimate of the volume for the respective sources of data. The comparison between the estimates of volume of the adjusted models starting from data of the stem measurements with bark and of the <b>stem</b> <b>analysis</b> without bark was accomplished with the test Qui-square, which demonstrated that there area no significant differences to be significant difference among the them allowing to affirm {{that it is possible to}} obtain the volume with bark starting from an equation generated with volume data without bark, obtained through the <b>stem</b> <b>analysis...</b>|$|E

Arabic roots are being utilized for many tasks; the process of extracting a word root {{is referred to as}} stemming.

However, stemming is faced with the problem of ambiguity, where two or more roots could be extracted from the same word. On the other hand, distributional semantics is a powerful co-occurrence model.

Data for the evaluation came from <b>stem</b> <b>analysis</b> of 60 dominant trees located in 30 "older" stands. Intensive data screening indicated that 53 of these trees exhibited signs of reduced height growth during their first 100 years of development due to competition from non-tree vegetation, hardwood tree species, and possibly other conifers in non-even-aged stands.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a fast fault simulation algorithm for combina-tional circuits, such as the critical path tracing method, is deter-mined primarily by the efficiency with which it can deduce the detectability of stem faults (<b>stem</b> <b>analysis).</b> We propose a graph based approach to perform <b>stem</b> <b>analysis.</b> A dynamic data struc-ture, called the criticality constraint graph, is used during the backward pass to carry information related to self masking and multiple-path sensitization of stem faults.

Better growth and yield information for aspen is required to manage this species properly. Height-age models for estimating site height and site index are provided in this paper. One-hundred and thirty-five <b>stem</b> <b>analysis</b> plots were established in six biogeoclimatic zones. Three trees in the 0. 04 ha plots were selected and stem analysed, and ecological data were collected at each plot. The <b>stem</b> <b>analysis</b> data were split into a model calibration and test data set. Two models were fit to the calibration data: a base model and an extended model that is calibrated for the six biogeoclimatic zones.
