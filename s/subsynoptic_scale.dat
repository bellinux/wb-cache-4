The modeling system is designed for both research and real-time forecast applications. The 14 -level numerical model, which has a 48 km grid mesh, can be run over most of North America and the adjacent oceanic regions.

In this note, {{the possibility of}} using 6. 7 -micron satellite-derived water vapor measurements to obtain higher resolution information about IPV distributions is examined. While attempts to related the two data sets analytically have so far proved unsuccessful, a qualitative comparison shows very similar features in both. The results obtained here suggest that, over limited areas, {{it may be possible to}} use 6. 7 -micron brightness temperatures to obtain approximate contours for water vapor mixing ratio on a particular isentropic surface in the upper troposphere. For areas free of high clouds, these contours are expected to parallel the IPV contours on this surface.

The cloud and water vapor 'winds' provide thermal gradient information for interpolating the soundings across cloudy regions. The loss of analysis integrity due to the reduction of VAS sounding density in the cloudy regions associated with synoptic activity is ameliorated by using cloud and water vapor motion winds.

This simple model has no topography, no direct wave forcing, and no small-scale forcing, nor any kind of gravity wave generation. The two-level model does, however, allow for the simple mechanism of baroclinic energy injection at the large (synoptic) scales as the model atmosphere relaxes to a specified north [...] south "radiative equilibrium" temperature gradient. It also has a small sink of energy at the small scales due to subgrid hyperdiffusion; this attempts to model the small-scale sink not resolved by the two-level QG model, in particular, enhanced viscous dissipation in atmospheric fronts.

40|$|Boundary layer {{evolution}} {{in response to}} diurnal forcing is manifested at the mesobeta and smaller scales of the atmosphere. Because this variability resides on <b>subsynoptic</b> <b>scales,</b> the potential influence upon convective storm environments is often not captured in coarse observational and modeling datasets, particularly for complex physical settings such as coastal regions. A detailed observational analysis of diurnally forced preconditioning for convective storm environments of South East Queensland, Australia (SEQ), during the Coastal Convective Interactions Experiment (2013 - 15) is presented. The observations used include surface-based measurements, aerological soundings, and dual-polarization Doppler radar. The sea-breeze circulation {{was found to be}} the dominant influence; however, profile modification by the coastward advection of the continental boundary layer was found to be an essential mechanism for favorable preconditioning of deep convection. This includes 1) enhanced moisture in the city of Brisbane, potentiality due to an urban heat island-enhanced land-sea thermal contrast, 2) significant afternoon warming and moistening above the sea breeze resulting from the advection of the inland convective boundary layer coastward under prevailing westerly flow coupled with the sea-breeze return flow, and 3) substantial variations in near-surface moisture likely associated with topography and land use. For the 27 November 2014 Brisbane hailstorm, which caused damages exceeding $ 1. 5 billion Australian dollars (AUD), the three introduced diurnal preconditioning processes are shown to favor a mesoscale convective environment supportive of large hailstone growth. The hybrid high-precipitation supercell storm mode noted for this event and previous similar events in SEQ is hypothesized to be more sensitive to variations in near-surface and boundary layer instability in contrast to contemporary supercell storms...|$|R

For the satellite data experiments, reanalyses are performed at intermediate times, using VAS soundings or VAS soundings in combination with satellite winds.

Errors are evaluated with the aid of sampling ('bootstrap') statistical methods. In addition, sensitivity tests have been performed which establish qualitative confidence in calculated fields of divergence and vorticity. The SASS wind algorithm could be improved; however, the data at this point are limited by instrument errors rather than analysis errors. The analysis error is typically negligible in comparison with the instrument error, but amounts to 30 percent of the instrument error in areas of strong wind shear. The scheme is very economical, and thus suitable for large volumes of dense data such as SASS data...|$|E

Results of an 18 -hour simulation during which synoptic scale cyclogenesis, <b>subsynoptic</b> <b>scale</b> jet streak adjustments, mesoscale convergence zones and tornadic storms were observed have shown the present model to {{have the potential for}} simulating the fine-scale structure of features associated with cyclogenesis and intense squall-line development.

For the population Of cyclones that formed over North America and the adjacent Atlantic Ocean during the Genesis of Atlantic Lows Experiment (GALE; 13 January- 16 March 1986), a variety of interrelationships between various cyclone characteristics are considered. Previous cyclone climatologies are extended by requiring no minimum cyclone amplitude. Particular attention is paid to the horizontal size distribution of the cyclones. It is found that 1) most cyclones are <b>subsynoptic</b> in <b>scale,</b> with only the deepest cyclones having a size consistent with classical baroclinic-instability theory; 2) almost all small-scale cyclones have a total life span of less than 48 h; 3) the pressure gradient within small-scale cyclones tends to be weaker than that within large-scale cyclones; 4) Atlantic cyclones deepen much more rapidly than cyclones over the continent but for many cyclones, deepening rate is an unsuitable measure of intensification; and 5) the geographical distribution of cyclogenesis during GALE is broadly similar to that found in more comprehensive climatologies, but some significant differences are present that are attributable to the inclusion of weak cyclones and stationary, orographically forced cyclones.

40|$|A {{review of}} 15 cases of low level jets (LLJ) which {{developed}} in the Great Plains is presented. For 12 out of the 15 cases, a systematic upper level flow pattern was isolated which includes {{the existence of a}} trough over the southwest United States and the propagation of upper level jet streaks from the Rocky Mountains toward the Great Plains. This flow pattern is responsible for lee side cyclogenesis or lee side troughing that produces the pressure gradients needed {{for the development of the}} LLJ. For the other three cases, a blocking ridge existed over the Great Plains and the upper level flow is relatively weak. It is during these situations that the classic, diurnal oscillating LLJ was observed.

40|$|Between late autumn {{and early}} spring, {{middle and high}} latitudes on Mars exhibit strong equatortopole mean {{temperature}} contrasts (i. e., "baroclinicity"). Data collected during the Viking era and observations from both the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) indicate that this strong baroclinicity supports vigorous, large-scale eastward traveling weather systems (i. e., transient synoptic periodwaves) [1, 2]. For a rapidly rotating, differentially heated, shallow atmosphere such as on Earth and Mars, these large-scale, extratropical weather disturbances are critical components of the global circulation. The wavelike disturbances act as agents in the transport of heat and momentum between low and high latitudes of the planet. Through cyclonic/anticyclonic winds, intense shear deformations, contractions-dilatations in temperature and density, and sharp perturbations amongst atmospheric tracers (i. e., dust, volatiles (e. g., water vapor) and condensates (e. g., water-ice cloud particles)), Mars extratropical weather systems have significant <b>subsynoptic</b> <b>scale</b> ramifications by supporting atmospheric frontal waves (Fig. 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A brief {{review is}} given of some {{published}} {{papers on the}} SΣSE warm and humid jugo wind on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea. Considering the large scale, jugo is connected with deep cyclones approaching from the Atlantic and moving towards the west Mediterranean and the Adriatic Sea, where the coastal and mountain effects induce perturbations and cyclonic activity, resulting in the phenomena of various, mainly unknown, <b>subsynoptic</b> <b>scale</b> features. Thus, depending on the cyclonic activities in the Mediterranean and the Adriatic Sea, the jugo speed cannot be predicted easily, particularly considering its maximal gusts reaching locally over 40 ms- 1. This paper presents a number of synoptic case studies which indicate that the high speeds and maximal gusts of jugo can be identified, and, therefore, also predicted, by the ALADIN forecasting model, together {{with the appearance of}} frontal zones and low-level, high wind speeds in the HRID high-resolution vertical time cross-section...|$|E

The evolution of the <b>subsynoptic</b> <b>scale</b> mass and momentum fields prior to and during the period of rapid development of the President's Day cyclone utilizing conventional data and SMS GOES imagery is documented.

40|$|<b>Subsynoptic</b> <b>scale</b> {{vortices}} {{that have}} been likened to tropical cyclones or polar lows (medicanes) are occasionally observed over the Mediterranean Sea. Generated over the sea, they are usually associated with strong winds and heavy precipitation and thus can be highly destructive in islands and costal areas. Only an accurate forecasting of such systems could mitigate these effects. However, at the moment, the predictability of these systems remains limited. Due to the scarcity of conventional observations, use is made of NOAA/MetOp satellite observations, for which advantage can be taken of the time coverage differences between the platforms that carry it, to give a very complete temporal description of the disturbances. A combination of AMSU-B (Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B) /MHS (Microwave Humidity Sounder) observations permit to investigate precipitation associated with these systems while coincident AMSU-A (Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A) observations give insights into the larger synoptic-scale {{environment in which they}} occur. Three different cases (in terms of intensity, location, trajectory, duration, and periods of the year – May, September and December, respectively) were investigated. Throughout these time periods, AMSU-A observations show that the persisting deep outflow of cold air over the sea together with an upper-level trough upstream constituted a favourable environment for the development of medicanes. AMSU-B/MHS based diagnostics show that convection and precipitation areas are large in the early stage of the low, but significantly reduced afterwards. Convection is maximum just after the upper-level trough, located upstream of cold mid-tropospheric air, reached its maximum intensity and acquired a cyclonic orientation...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2006. The {{predictability}} of {{the atmosphere}} depends, in part, on {{the accuracy of the}} initial states of numerical weather prediction models. Adjoints of numerical weather prediction models are used to produce initial condition sensitivities of some chosen forecast metric, quantifying such predictability. Previous studies investigating the nature of such sensitivities have used forecast metrics which typically diagnose cyclogenesis. Localized, uphear-tilted, <b>subsynoptic</b> <b>scale</b> sensitivity structures which maximize in the middle to lower troposphere are common results of these studies. However, due to the requirement of significant computational resources, these studies have typically been performed with simplified physics, coarse resolution, and other approximations used within the adjoint models. With modern computational resources, the work in this thesis extends the understanding of initial condition sensitivity computed at coarse resolution with simplified physics to that at higher resolution with more advanced physics, which more accurately characterizes real-time modern numerical weather prediction. It is found that sensitivity structures vary significantly with different model physics, basic-state trajectories, and resolution. The most pronounced variations occur with respect to model horizontal resolution, as sensitivity structures decrease in scale, increase in magnitude, and decrease in tangent-linear accuracy as horizontal grid spacing decreases from 216 -km to 24 -km resolution. An alternative measure, ensemble sensitivity, is introduced and is defined as the slope of the linear regression of a forecast metric onto each initial-time model state variable within an ensemble of forecasts. These ensemble sensitivities are shown to be a product of the initial-time covariance statistics of the ensembles and the initial-time adjoint sensitivity of the same forecast metric calculated about the forecast begun from the ensemble-mean initial condition under tangent-linear assumptions. Ensemble sensitivities reflect a statistical and dynamical understanding of the flow, and {{can also be used to}} develop computationally efficient measures of data impact and targeting strategies by exploiting their relationship to adjoint sensitivities. The flexibility of the forecast metric also allows for investigation of data impact and targeting strategies associated with high-impact weather events...|$|E
40|$|Thin, subvisible cirrus (SVC) clouds at the {{tropical}} tropopause {{have been observed}} {{by a number of}} methods in a variety of observational programs, including in situ sampling and aircraft and space-based lidar. Modeling studies suggest that these clouds {{play an important role in}} dehydrating tropospheric air as it enters the stratosphere. This is because particles large enough to have significant fall speeds can form under the conditions of slow cooling that are implied by the large horizontal extent of the SVC sheets. The IR radiation that these clouds absorb, and the upward vertical motion this implies, also makes them candidates for a tropical troposphere-to-stratosphere mass transfer mechanism. They may also play a role in the earth's radiation budget. These sheets were observed on five flights during the Tropical Ozone Transport Experiment (TOTE) by the NASA Langley DIAL lidar aboard NASA's DC- 8 research aircraft operating during December 1995 and February 1996 south of Hawaii. The relationship of the SVC's observed during TOTE to convection was not a simple one. One class of SVC's are within 1000 km of the persistent strong convection near 15 S (the SPCZ). Trajectory analyses indicated that the SVC air masses have in fact passed through the SPCZ within a few days of observation. These clouds are very close to the tropopause, with maximum potential temperatures not much higher than 370 K, consistent with in situ water and total water measurements near the tropopause made during the Stratosphere Troposphere Exchange Project in January 1987 at Darwin, Australia. A second class of SVC's are not immediately downstream of convection. These clouds tend to be higher, reaching potential temperatures of 390 K or more. Trajectory analyses indicate that the air in these SVC's originates either in the equatorial western Pacific or along the subtropical jet. In any case, the warm temperatures the SVC air masses encounter just prior to the observation time along the back trajectory imply that the clouds cannot be residual particles from cirrus blowoff, but must form locally as the air move upward and equatorward south of Hawaii. Since all the parcels have encountered colder temperatures than those at the time of observation early in their history, <b>subsynoptic</b> <b>scale</b> temperatures colder than the analysis temperatures appear to be required to explain the formation of ice particles. In fact, the sloping shapes of the SVC's do suggest that they are gravity or inertia-gravity waves. In situ meteorological measurements made by the ER- 2 within a day of the DC- 8 remote lidar observations show a gravity wave structure near the equator with an estimated period of about 30 hours. This is sufficiently long to allow large particles to form and fall out (thus allowing dehydration). Other ER- 2 flights south of Hawaii at other times of year show gravity and inertia-gravity waves with a poleward wavenumber component and significant (5 degrees peak to peak) temperature perturbation...|$|E
