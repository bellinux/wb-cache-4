5|$|Congress {{considered}} {{raising the}} five-dollar legal tender limit on trade dollars, but instead {{passed a bill}} that officially demonetized the trade dollar on July 22, 1876; the <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Treasury</b> was directed by the act to strike no more of the coins than necessary for use in trade. Despite the demonetization of the trade dollar, bullion producers continued to place the coins into the American market, resulting in an estimated seven million coins circulating within the United States, of which more than four million were placed in circulation in 1877. Despite the 1876 act, {{it was not until}} October 15, 1877 that Sherman (now <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Treasury)</b> finally ordered that the mints not accept orders for trade dollars. On November 5, apparently believing a false report that additional supplies were needed for the Chinese New Year, he rescinded his order, finally ending orders for trade dollars on February 22, 1878.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the other}} issues {{involving}} Hamilton were bypassing the rising issue of slavery in Congress after Quakers petitioned for its abolition (though {{he returned to the}} issue the following year), Duer having resigned as Assistant <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Treasury,</b> and the vote of assumption being voted down 31 votes to 29 on April 12.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} debt increased {{as a result}} during Hamilton's service as <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Treasury,</b> but the nation established its good credit. Many in the Congress {{and elsewhere in the}} government profited from trading in the debt paper which was assumed. Many of Washington's fellow Virginians and others were vexed by this, but he considered that they had adequate redress through their Congressional representatives.|$|E
5|$|The <b>secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Treasury</b> {{was delighted}} to hear Keynes had amassed enough to provide a {{temporary}} solution for the British Government.

5|$|With Clayton's aid, Taylor {{chose the}} six {{remaining}} {{members of his}} cabinet. One of the incoming Congress's first actions would be to establish the Department of the Interior, so Taylor would be appointing that department's inaugural secretary. Thomas Ewing, who had previously served as a senator from Ohio and as <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Treasury</b> under William Henry Harrison, accepted the patronage-rich position of Secretary of the Interior. For the position of Postmaster General, which {{also served as a}} center of patronage, Taylor chose Congressman Jacob Collamer of Vermont. After Horace Binney refused appointment as <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Treasury,</b> Taylor chose another prominent Philadelphian in William M. Meredith. George W. Crawford a former Governor of Georgia, accepted the position of Secretary of War, while Congressman William B. Preston of Virginia became Secretary of the Navy. Senator Reverdy Johnson of Maryland accepted appointment as Attorney General, and Johnson {{became one of the most}} influential members of Taylor's cabinet.

5|$|Truman {{surrounded}} {{himself with}} his old friends, and appointed several to high positions that seemed well beyond their competence, including his two <b>secretaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>treasury,</b> Fred Vinson and John Snyder.
