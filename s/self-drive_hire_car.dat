Incorporated in 1919 {{to take over}} the operations of Daimler's hire department, Daimler Hire was a subsidiary of The Daimler Company Limited.

40|$|In {{response}} to recommendations from {{the review of}} the Victorian taxi industry, the objective of this project was to evaluate the appropriateness of current taxi and <b>hire</b> <b>car</b> age limits in ensuring safety of the taxi and <b>hire</b> <b>car</b> fleets. The aim was also to identify and analyse all associated issues including safety that the Taxi Services Commission (TSC) should consider in setting age limits for taxis and <b>hire</b> <b>cars</b> into the future. The project used a two phase methodology to meet these objectives. Phase one involved extensive consultation with relevant stakeholders in the taxi and <b>hire</b> <b>car</b> industries to determine issues relevant to the choice and operation of vehicles as taxis and <b>hire</b> <b>cars.</b> The second phase involved extensive analysis of the safety performance of the taxi and <b>hire</b> <b>car</b> fleet including the risk of crash involvement and injury outcomes related to vehicle choice {{in the event of a}} crash. The analysis then examined the relationship between these factors, taxi or <b>hire</b> <b>car</b> type and vehicle age. The safety performance was then used to construct an analytical model to test the influence of various scenarios not only for changes in taxi and <b>hire</b> <b>car</b> age limits but also scenarios related to safer vehicle choice and reduced vehicle crash risk related to improvements in driving standards. Finally, the economic worth of each of the scenarios considered was estimated in order to identify the most cost-effective strategies for improving the future safety of the taxi and <b>hire</b> <b>car</b> fleet. Recommendations for future policy on taxi and <b>hire</b> <b>car</b> age limits, vehicle choice and driver focused interventions were made and priorities for further research identified...|$|R

40|$|Tourism {{statistics}} point towards increased tourist mobility in holiday destinations, with {{a subsequent}} rise in associated externalities, above all those related {{with the use}} of <b>hire</b> <b>cars.</b> This paper therefore suggests that a fixed-rate tax should be levied on vehicle hire in order to reduce congestion externalities and thus achieves more efficient traffic levels. With this purpose in mind, count data models were used to assess alternative ways of modeling the demand function for <b>hire</b> <b>cars</b> in Mallorca (Spain) so that the corrective potential of the proposed tax could then be analyzed. Although the inelasticity that was observed might indicate a low short-run capacity to means of group transport. In the mid-run, this would lead to increased elasticity and, in consequence, to better environmental effectiveness internalize costs, it also represents a high potential for raising revenue {{that could be used to}} fund alternative.
