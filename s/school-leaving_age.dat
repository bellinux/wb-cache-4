40|$|We {{propose to}} model {{individual}} educational investments as a rational decision, maximizing expected utility, conditional on some characteristics observed by the student, under the combined risks affecting future wages and schooling duration. Assuming that students' attitudes toward risk {{can be represented}} by a CRRA utility, we show that the risk-aversion parameter can be identified in a natural way, using the variation in <b>school-leaving</b> <b>ages,</b> conditional on certified educational levels. Estimation can be performed by means of classic Maximum Likelihood methods. The model can easily be compared with a non-structural, simplified version, which is a standard wage equation with endogenous dummy variables representing education levels, education levels being themselves determined by an Ordered Probit model. We find small but significant values of the coefficient of relative risk aversion, between 0 : 1 and 0 : 9. These results are obtained with a rich sample of 12, 500 young men who left the educational system in 1992, in France. ...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{based on}} firm-level data find that both {{exporting}} firms and multinational corporations pay higher wages {{for a given}} skill level. However, the literature overlooks the fact that export manufacturing firms may also change the educational choices of the workforce. In this paper, I confirm that for Mexico during the period 1986 - 2000, the export sector pays higher wages than other sectors, but school drop out increases {{with the arrival of}} new export jobs. By the year 2000, the workers induced to enter export manufacturing are earning less than they would have earned had the jobs never appeared and they stayed in school longer. I identify the causal effects by looking within municipalities and examining how the education of different cohorts varies with new factory openings in the municipality at key <b>school-leaving</b> <b>ages.</b> Export manufacturing attracts students by paying high relative wages for unskilled workers, and offering many jobs to low-skill workers straight out of school.

5|$|During the Second World War, Wilkinson {{served in}} Churchill's wartime {{coalition}} {{as a junior}} minister, mainly at the Ministry of Home Security where she worked under Herbert Morrison. She supported Morrison's attempts to replace Clement Attlee as the Labour Party's leader; nevertheless, when he formed his postwar government, Attlee appointed Wilkinson as Minister of Education. By this time, her health was poor, a legacy of years of overwork. She saw her main task in office as {{the implementation of the}} wartime coalition's 1944 Education Act, rather than the more radical introduction of comprehensive schools favoured by many in the Labour Party. Much of her energy was applied to organising the raising of the <b>school-leaving</b> <b>age</b> from 14 to 15. During the exceptionally cold weather of early 1947, she succumbed to a bronchial disease, and died after an overdose of medication, which the coroner at her inquest declared was accidental.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{attaining}} the premiership, Chamberlain obtained {{passage of}} the Factories Act 1937. This Act was aimed at bettering working conditions in factories, and placed limits on the working hours of women and children. In 1938, Parliament enacted the Coal Act 1938, which allowed for nationalisation of coal deposits. Another major law passed that year was the Holidays with Pay Act. Though the Act only recommended that employers give workers a week off with pay, it led to a great expansion of holiday camps and other leisure accommodation for the working classes. The Housing Act of 1938 provided subsidies aimed at encouraging slum clearance and maintained rent control. Chamberlain's plans for the reform of local government were shelved because of the outbreak of war in 1939. Likewise, the raising of the <b>school-leaving</b> <b>age</b> to 15, scheduled for implementation on 1 September 1939, did not go into effect. In the event, it wasn't until 1 September 1972 when the age was raised from 15 to 16, following preparations which began 1964.|$|E

40|$|Introduction At {{first sight}} child labour may {{not appear to}} be a {{material}} issue for Australian companies and investors: Australia has labour laws that prescribe the minimum <b>school-leaving</b> and employment <b>age.</b> Australia also has a rich tradition in worker representation and a trade union movement active in advancing labour rights. However Australia is not an island when purchasing goods and services, and global markets for labour no longer align with national borders.   Today many companies operate through complex global supply chains. * The globalisation of business can provide opportunities for economic and social development; however, outsourcing labour without oversight can lead to worker exploitation, particularly as much of the production takes place in countries that are out of reach of Australia’s national employment laws.   While there may be an ‘out of sight, out of mind’ approach to worker rights in the developing world, the issue of child labour is much harder for companies to ignore. Spurred on by civil society pressure† and global conventions underpinning the rights of children, the global movement to eradicate child labour has gained significant pace over recent years. These approaches are often reactive and have been in response to finding children working in supply chains. But increasingly, global unions and non-government organisations (NGOs) have joined companies and investors to find ways to minimise the risks of child labour in global supply chains.   This report looks at those efforts. It draws on extensive expert opinion and interviews to highlight steps that are being taken and challenges confronted along the way. It is a unique report in the Australian context, in that its central goal is not to expose bad behaviour but to inform and embolden companies and investors who want to take action about this issue with an evidence base upon which to act. The report brings to life the substantial work being done by unions and NGOs that can assist and guide those efforts. Above all, it is hoped the report supports more effective collaboration and partnerships between civil society, companies, and investors in the global fight against child labour.  ...|$|R

25|$|MacDonald's second {{government}} {{was in a}} stronger parliamentary position than his first, and in 1930 {{he was able to}} raise unemployment pay, pass an act to improve wages and conditions in the coal industry (i.e. the issues behind the General Strike) and pass a housing act which focused on slum clearances. However, an attempt by the Education Minister Charles Trevelyan to introduce an act to raise the <b>school-leaving</b> <b>age</b> to 15 was defeated by opposition from Roman Catholic Labour MPs, who feared that the costs would lead to increasing local authority control over faith schools.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} growing overlap between the Vocational Education and Training (VET), {{organised}} under the National Training System, and Higher Education sectors in Australia. Courses are primarily taken by those aged over 18, however in some vocational and general academic courses a minority of students enter at the minimum <b>school-leaving</b> <b>age</b> of 16, although from May 2009 Federal Government policy calls {{for young people to}} be in education, gainful employment, or training until age 17 (Year 12 qualification) with tightening of income support payments to age 20 if not undertaking further training. This tends to happen particularly at Technical and Further Education colleges (TAFE), and is less likely to happen at a university or a private institution.|$|E
25|$|Wage rates also rose {{significantly}} {{under the}} coalition, as characterised by a 60% real {{increase in the}} hourly wages of manufacturing sector employees between 1970 and 1980. In addition, educational opportunities were significantly widened {{as a result of}} policies such as the introduction of free higher education, the raising of the <b>school-leaving</b> <b>age</b> to 16, increased expenditure on education at all levels, and the introduction of a generous student stipend system. Although the coalition failed to restructure the education system along comprehensive lines, the cumulative impact of its educational reforms was such that according to Helmut Becker (an authoritative commentator on German education), there was greater achievement at all levels and the chances of a twenty-year-old working-class child born in 1958 going to college or university was approximately six times greater than a similar child born ten years earlier.|$|E
