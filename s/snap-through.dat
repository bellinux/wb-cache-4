40|$|Many elastic {{structures}} {{have two}} possible equilibrium states [1]: from umbrellas that become inverted {{in a sudden}} gust of wind, to nanoelectromechanical switches [2, 3], origami patterns [4, 5] and the hopper popper, which jumps after being turned inside-out [6]. These systems typically transition from one state to the other via a rapid ‘snap-through’. <b>Snap-through</b> allows plants to gradually store elastic energy, before releasing it suddenly to generate rapid motions [7, 8], as in the Venus flytrap [9]. Similarly, the beak of the hummingbird snaps through to catch insects mid-flight [10], while technological applications are increasingly exploiting <b>snap-through</b> instabilities [11 – 13]. In all of these scenarios, it {{is the ability to}} repeatedly generate fast motions that gives <b>snap-through</b> its utility. However, estimates of the speed of <b>snap-through</b> suggest that it should occur more quickly than is usually observed. Here, we study the dynamics of snapthrough in detail, showing that, even without dissipation, the dynamics slow down close to the <b>snap-through</b> transition.

40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this {{dissertation}} is the characterization of <b>snap-through</b> buckling of discrete and continuous systems. <b>Snap-through</b> buckling occurs as the consequence of two factors, first the destabilization, or more often the disappearance of, an equilibrium position under the change of a system parameter, and second the existence of another stable equilibrium configuration at a remote location in state space. In this sense <b>snap-through</b> buckling is a global dynamic transition {{as the result of}} a local static instability. In order to better understand the static instabilities that lead to <b>snap-through</b> buckling, the behavior of mechanical systems in the vicinity of various local bifurcations is first investigated. Oscillators with saddle-node, pitchfork, and transcritical bifurcations are shown analytically to exhibit several interesting characteristics, particularly in relation to the system damping ratio. A simple mechanical oscillator with a transcritical bifurcation is used to experimentally verify the analytical results. The transcritical bifurcation was selected since it may be used to represent generic bifurcation behavior. It is shown that the damping ratio may be used to predict changes in stability with respect to changing system parameters. Another useful indicator of <b>snap-through</b> is the presence of chaos in the dynamic response of a system. Chaos is usually associated <b>snap-through,</b> as in many systems large amplitude responses are typically necessary to sufficiently engage the nonlinearities that induce chaos. Thus, a pragmatic approach for identifying chaos in experimental (and hence noisy) systems is also developed. The method is applied to multiple experimental systems showing good agreement with identification via Lyapunov exponents. Under dynamic loading, systems with the requisite condition for <b>snap-through</b> buckling, that is co-existing equilibria, typically exhibit either small amplitude response about a single equilibrium configuration, or large amplitude response that transits between the static equilibria. Dynamic <b>snap-through</b> is the name given to the large amplitude response, which, in the context of structural systems, is obviously undesirable. This phenomenon is investigated using experimental, numerical, and analytical means and the boundaries separating safe (non-snap-through) from unsafe (<b>snap-through)</b> dynamic response in forcing parameter space are obtained for both a discrete and a continuous arch. Arches present an ideal avenue for the investigation of <b>snap-through</b> as they typically have multiple, often tunable, stable and unstable equilibria. They also have many direct applications in both civil engineering, where arches are a canonical structural element, and mechanical engineering, where arches may be used to approximate the behavior of curved plates and panels such as those used on aircraft.

40|$|The United States Air Force and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration {{have made}} great efforts and spent untold {{resources}} to develop reusable hypersonic vehicles {{since the early}} 1950 s. In spite of great progress, many scientific and technical challenges still exist. This thesis focuses on developing a robust and efficient computational framework for analyzing <b>snap-through,</b> which is a particular concern for the commonly used slender curved structural components of reusable hypersonic vehicles since it can significantly exacerbate fatigue failure. <b>Snap-through</b> {{is a type of}} instability where a curved structure suddenly jumps to a remote configuration. This behavior is highly nonlinear involving sudden and large deformations. <b>Snap-through</b> is a dynamic instability triggered by the loss of stability of an equilibrium state. Examining equilibria and their stability is useful and necessary before costlier transient simulations of <b>snap-through.</b> Curved structures undergoing <b>snap-through</b> can have equilibrium states that cannot be captured by path following algorithms. Two types of ``hidden" equilibria are identified: secondary equilibrium branches bifurcated from the primary path and coexisting equilibria unconnected with the primary path. A numerical procedure that combines branch-switching and arclength methods is proposed to retrieve bifurcated secondary branches, and an analytical approach is introduced to obtain unconnected equilibria. With knowledge of the entire equilibrium manifold, transient simulations of <b>snap-through</b> are then investigated. Time integration of <b>snap-through</b> is very challenging because it is a highly nonlinear behavior involving sudden jumps. Even state-of-the-art schemes fail to provide accurate and efficient long-time predictions. This dissertation extends the preliminary work on an efficient composite scheme with significantly enhanced numerical accuracy and computational efficiency in simulating <b>snap-through.</b> In the design of slender curved components of reusable hypersonic vehicles, it is beneficial to efficiently identify the stability boundaries that separate non-snap from post-snap responses for different designs and loading conditions. Obtaining stability boundaries directly from parametric studies is computationally costly even with the most efficient algorithms. To alleviate the cost, an alternative approach to quickly approximate dynamic stability boundaries is proposed. This approach significantly decreases the number of transient simulations needed and therefore greatly accelerates the exploration of dynamic stability boundaries...|$|E

By assuming the joint behaviour as ideal hinges and using the large deformation theory based on a linear elastic material, a simple analytical model for the stability of the von Mises truss was formulated.

30|$|One of {{the main}} {{difficulties}} in an implicit simulation of a rather thin-walled, flexible tubular structure is bifurcation of solutions. In many instances during the simulation loading, there were negative eigenvalues indicating buckling or unstable solutions. The first and most obvious case was when initially suturing and pinching the tube. Initial models attempted to pinch the corners and then subsequently applying pressure. This caused <b>snap-through</b> of the tube wall, and convergence was extremely difficult. To avoid <b>snap-through,</b> the control point {{in the middle of}} the leaflet was introduced so that it was simultaneously closed and pinched (see Fig.  6).|$|E
