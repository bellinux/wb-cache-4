It recommended that Australia should adopt a <b>single</b> <b>system</b> following detailed trials of potential systems, {{that it should be}} implemented with high definition capabilities from the outset, that each licensed commercial or public service should have access to a full 7MHz channel for its services, and that the eventual termination of analog PAL services should be driven by market factors and subject to regular review. The year 2000 was highlighted as a potential target date for the commencement of permanent digital terrestrial broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1930s {{electricity}} was supplied by municipal undertakings. These were small power companies that built power stations {{dedicated to a}} single industry or group of factories, and sold any excess electricity to the public. These companies used widely differing standards of voltage and frequency. In 1925 Parliament decided that the power grid should be a <b>single</b> <b>system</b> with uniform standards and under public ownership. Several of the private power companies reacted to the proposal by forming the London Power Company. They planned to heed parliament's recommendations and build {{a small number of}} very large stations.|$|E
5|$|The first {{proposal}} that the membranes within cells form a <b>single</b> <b>system</b> that exchanges material between its components was by Morré and Mollenhauer in 1974. This proposal was {{made as a}} way of explaining how the various lipid membranes are assembled in the cell, with these membranes being assembled through lipid flow from the sites of lipid synthesis. The idea of lipid flow through a continuous system of membranes and vesicles was an alternative to the various membranes being independent entities that are formed from transport of free lipid components, such as fatty acids and sterols, through the cytosol. Importantly, the transport of lipids through the cytosol and lipid flow through a continuous endomembrane system are not mutually exclusive processes and both may occur in cells.|$|E

5|$|The first talkies {{shown in}} the Indies, Fox Movietone Follies of 1929 and The Rainbow Man (both 1929), came from the United States and were {{screened}} in late 1929.

The comedy, made with a <b>single</b> <b>system</b> camera that Krugers had obtained {{with the help of}} his Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers membership, is generally thought the first locally produced talkie released in the country, but had poor technical quality. It was a critical failure, as the majority Sundanese audience felt that they were being insulted; contemporary director Joshua Wong suggested that this poor reception was partly owing to the main character eating a frog, something which is forbidden for Muslims.|$|E

Bayan Beleq Mosque and other Wetu Telu mosques are always built of the most traditional materials: a multi-tiered pyramidal thatched roof made of alang-alang or bamboo shingles, supported with four main posts; a typical vernacular mosque style in Indonesia. Wetu Telu mosques have a square plan and walls covered in wood and bamboo, resembling early mosques from Ternate and Tidore.

Service was first extended to serve Ithaca’s suburbs in the 1970s, and to rural towns beginning in 1982. In 1974, a transit service in Northeast Ithaca (Lansing, Cayuga Heights and the Town of Ithaca) was started by apartment owners contracting with Swarthout Coaches to operate limited service for Cornell students, and as the public demand for service increased, the apartment owners sought assistance from local governments and Cornell University, which became Northeast Transit in 1978.|$|E
25|$|The three docks were {{initially}} separate, {{with the two}} northern docks interconnected only via the basin at each end, and South Dock connected via {{a series of three}} basins at the eastern end. Railway access was very difficult. Under PLA control, cuts were made to connect the three docks into a <b>single</b> <b>system,</b> and the connections to the Thames at the western end were filled, along with the Limehouse basin and with it the western connection between the two northern docks. This allowed improved road and rail access from the north and west. South Dock was also connected to the north end of Millwall Dock, its enlarged eastern lock becoming the only entrance from the Thames to the whole West India and Millwall system.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} days of rail {{transport}} in the United States, Philadelphia has served as hub for several major rail companies, particularly the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Reading Railroad. The Pennsylvania Railroad first operated Broad Street Station, then 30th Street Station and Suburban Station, and the Reading Railroad operated out of Reading Terminal, now part of the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The two companies also operated competing commuter rail systems in the area, known collectively as the Regional Rail system. The two systems today, for the most part still intact but now connected, operate as a <b>single</b> <b>system</b> {{under the control of the}} SEPTA, the regional transit authority.

25|$|Classical Chinese {{astronomy}} {{is recorded}} in the Han period and appears {{in the form of}} three schools, which are attributed to astronomers of the Warring States period. The constellations of the three schools were conflated into a <b>single</b> <b>system</b> by Chen Zhuo, an astronomer of the 3rd century (Three Kingdoms period). Chen Zhuo's work has been lost, but information on his system of constellations survives in Tang period records, notably by Qutan Xida. The oldest extant Chinese star chart dates to that period and was preserved as part of the Dunhuang Manuscripts. Native Chinese astronomy flourished during the Song dynasty, and during the Yuan Dynasty became increasingly influenced by medieval Islamic astronomy (see Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era). As maps were prepared during this period on more scientific lines they were considered as more reliable.|$|E
25|$|As the {{feudal system}} collapsed, most {{legislative}} power {{transferred from the}} nobility to local kings. Increased trade during the Warring States period produced a stronger merchant class. The new kings established an elaborate bureaucracy, using it to wage wars, build large temples, and enact public-works projects. This meritocratic system rewarded talent over birthright. Greater use of iron tools revolutionized agriculture {{and led to a}} large population increase during this period. In 221, the king of the Qin declared himself the First Emperor, uniting China into a single empire, its various state walls into the Great Wall, and its various peoples and traditions into a <b>single</b> <b>system</b> of government. Although their initial implementation led to its overthrow in 206, the Qin's institutions survived. During the Han Dynasty (3rd century to 3rd century), China became a strong, unified, and centralized empire of self-sufficient farmers and artisans, with limited local autonomy.|$|E

A Microsoft Windows port was later developed by Rockstar New England and released on 21 October 2008. The game features exclusive content which is unavailable in the original version, including new missions, characters, school classes, and unlockable items and clothing. Some small script changes have been made, and the highly compressed voice files of the original have been replaced with higher-quality versions. The random NPCs also have more lines. In addition, <b>single</b> <b>system</b> two-player competitive multiplayer minigames have also been added, along with Achievements for the Xbox 360 version and Wii Remote and Nunchuk motion and pointer controls for the Wii version.
