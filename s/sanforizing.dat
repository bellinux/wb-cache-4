40|$|Pair of commercially {{produced}} Wrangler denim jeans {{that were}} found in the southern Rocky mountains across from Red River, New Mexico in the late 1960 's. The pants had been bleached in irregular patterns by the sun, and had various worn and torn places. After discovery, the Wranglers were embellished with red velour fabric pieces to cover some of the worst structural damage, and with a commercially available embroidered butterfly patch added below waistband at center back. Labels: Evidence of rectangular tag having been sewn on right-side back pocket. Both back pockets have "W" stitching; Fly button engraved "Wrangler"; Tag sewn inside fly: "Wrangler / 30 x 34 / <b>Sanforized</b> / Made in U. S. A. "; Zipper pull stamped "Gripper Zipper" and "Pat Pending"; Marked on left front pocket, inside pants: "GDW...|$|R
50|$|In 1928, he {{developed}} the process of <b>Sanforizing</b> (patented in 1930), to pre-shrink cotton or other fabrics by squeezing material against a stretched rubber strip or band and allowing the pair to shrink together, to offset the stretching of fabrics during prior weaving or finishing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sanforizing</b> or Pre-shrinking {{prevents}} {{a fabric}} and the produced garment from shrinking after production. This {{is also a}} mechanical finish, acquired by feeding the fabric between a roller and rubber blanket, {{in such a way}} the rubber blanket compresses the weft threads and imparts compressive shrinkage.|$|E
50|$|The cloth is {{continually}} {{fed into the}} <b>sanforizing</b> machine and therein moistened with either water or steam. A rotating cylinder presses a rubber sleeve against another, heated, rotating cylinder. Thereby the sleeve briefly gets compressed and laterally expanded, afterwards relaxing to its normal thickness. The cloth to be treated is transported between rubber sleeve and heated cylinder and is forced to follow this brief compression and lateral expansion, and relaxation. It is thus shrunk.|$|E
50|$|Cluett {{was known}} for several inventions, {{including}} a sextant and farm mowers, before patents for <b>Sanforizing.</b> In 1896, he invented the bubble sextant for use in celestial navigation. In 1901 {{he was hired by}} the Walter A. Wood Company in Hoosick Falls, New York, for the manufacturing of mowers, reapers and other farm machinery. In developing some horse-drawn mowers operable from the driver's seat, his two-horse and one-horse mowers had a vertical lift at the cutting bar.|$|E
