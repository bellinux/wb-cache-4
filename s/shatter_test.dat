40|$|The {{results of}} {{investigations}} of the granulation process of foundry dusts generated in the dry mechanical reclamation process of usedsands, where furan resins were binders are presented in the paper. Investigations concerned producing of granules of the determineddimensions and strength parameters. Granules were formed from the dusts mixture consisting in 50 mass% of dusts obtained after the reclamation of the furane sands and in 50 mass % of dusts from sands with bentonite. Dusts from the bentonite sands with water were used as a binder allowing the granulation of after reclamation dusts from the furane sands. The following parameters of the ready final product were determined: moisture content (W), <b>shatter</b> <b>test</b> of granules (Wz) performeddirectly after the granulation process and after 1, 3, 5, 10 days and nights of seasoning, water-resistance of granules after 24 hours of being immersed in water, surface porosity ep and volumetric porosity ev. In addition the <b>shatter</b> <b>test</b> and water-resistance of granulate dried at a temperature of 105 oC were determined. Investigations were performed at the bowl angle of inclination 45 o, for three rotational speeds of the bowl being: 10, 15, 20 rpm. For the speed of 10 rpm the granulation tests of dusts mixture after the preliminary mixing in the roller mixer and with the addition ofwater-glass {{in the amount of}} 2 % in relation to the amount of dust were carried out. The obtained results indicate that the granulator allows to obtain granules from dusts originated from the reclamations of mouldingsands with the furane resin with an addition of dusts from the bentonite sands processing plants...|$|E
40|$|The most {{critical}} parameters for the efficient design of coal processing operations {{depend on the}} assessment of coal breakage and washability characteristics of the coal resource. X-ray computed tomography (XCT) technology has been demonstrated to have the capability of analyzing washability and fragmentation parameters (particle size, energy, coal type). In this regard, progeny size distributions are obtained from sequential modified drop <b>shatter</b> <b>tests</b> (different input energy levels) and from XCT analysis. In this way, the breakage characteristics (selection and breakage functions) of coal particles are established and the prediction of particle size distribution (PSD) for different levels of energy input is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} of coal is usually {{determined by the}} tumbler <b>tests</b> and <b>shatter</b> <b>tests.</b> The strength index is an empirical and its numerical value cannot be used to predict the extent of breakage in a bulk handling circuit. A new drop test procedure has been developed to measure the {{strength of}} the coal based on the extent of the breakage due to repeatedly drop from a predetermined height. The lump size coal breaks in the tumbler drum by volume breakage and surface breakage; the extent of one affects the extent of other. Tumbler index is not directly related to any fundamental material property but depends on the number of lifters in the drum and material parameters, which include particle size and strength. The rate of degradation is higher on larger lump sizes coal compare to smaller lump size. At small drop heights, the stress of impact experienced by the sample sizes is comparatively smaller and resulting in a much lower extend of volume breakage and increase the significant of surface breakage...|$|R
2500|$|The Wasp Major engines had {{a prodigious}} {{appetite}} for lubricating oil: each engine required a dedicated 100gal (380l) tank. Normal maintenance consisted of tedious measures, like changing the 56 spark plugs {{on each of}} the six engines; the plugs were often fouled by the lead in the 145 octane anti-knock fuel required by the R-4360 engines. Thus, each service required changing 336 spark plugs. [...] Another frequent maintenance job was replacing the dozens of bomb bay light bulbs, which routinely <b>shattered</b> during <b>test</b> firing of the turret guns.|$|R
40|$|Two {{case studies}} on Danish sandy loams {{investigated}} {{long-term effects of}} fertilization and crop rotation. Case Study 1 compared a diversely cropped organically farmed soil (DFG(1)) with a conventionally farmed soil predominantly growing annual crops (DFA), both receiving animal manure. In Case Study 2, a diversely cropped organically managed soil DFG(2)) receiving animal manure was compared with an almost exclusively cereal cropped conventionally farmed soil receiving no animal manure (CCC). A multi-level experimental strategy was followed to compare integrating field methods with specialized laboratory methods. Ease of tillage was described {{in the field and}} characterized using a drop shatter field test and by measuring aggregate tensile strength. Fitness as a seedbed was characterised visually in the field and from the drop <b>shatter</b> <b>test.</b> Impedance to seedling emergence and root penetration was evaluated by measuring bulk soil shear strength. For Case Study 1, soil tilth was better for the DFA soil than for the DFG(1) soil (i. e. lower soil strength and higher ease of fragmentation and friability index for DFA). However, a crumbly structure and a moderate bulk density suggested that the DFG(1) soil was also a favourable medium for plant growth. For Case Study 2, the CCC soil had a lower organic matter content, higher bulk density, higher soil strength, and lower ease of fragmentation in comparison with the DFG(2) soil...|$|E
40|$|Conventional coal {{washability}} {{analysis is}} achieved by conducting Float and Sink (FaS) test, which is sampling dependent, destructive and uses environmentally hazardous chemicals. With the improvement of modern 2 D and 3 D imaging technologies, image analysis methods of digital CT scanned images are being developed and trialled to predict coal washability in a more flexible, efficient and safe way. To support the validity of this approach, this study illustrates the fundamental differences in breakage and liberation behaviour of coal lithotypes at the same rank from a single seam. Nine lithotype samples were repeatedly CT scanned before and {{after a series of}} 2 m drops to emulate fragmentation during the drop <b>shatter</b> <b>test.</b> The 3 D watershed segmentation method was applied to scans to monitor changes in fragment size distribution and then assign a density to each fragment to obtain coal washability. Comparison between the processed image analysis results and FaS tests conducted after 31 drops show a very good match both in particle size distribution and coal washability for all the lithotypes. Results also show that dull coal or stone illustrate better agreement between CT image analysis and FaS test due to their very low percentage of small particles which may lead to underestimation when using CT image analysis. Possible ways of improving small particles estimation would be to use an XY plane H-maxima method and low merging coefficient in the image analysis process...|$|E
40|$|Coke breeze is {{the main}} fuel used in the {{sintering}} process. The value of - 3 + 1 mm. represents the most favorable particle size for coke breeze in the sintering process. About 20 % of total coke fines (- 0. 5 mm) are produced during different steps of preparation. Introducing these fines during the sintering process proves to be very harmful for different operating parameters. Thus,this study aims at investigating the production of granules resulting from these fines using molasses as organic binder and its application in sintering of an iron ore. The {{results showed that the}} granules having the highest mechanical properties were obtained with 14. 5 wt % molasses addition. The sintering experiments were performed by using coke breeze in different shapes (- 3 + 1 mm in size, coke breeze without sieving and coke breeze granules - 3 + 1 mm). The reduction experiments, microscopic structure and X-ray analysis for the produced sinter were carried out. The results revealed that, all sinter properties (such as <b>shatter</b> <b>test,</b> productivity of sinter machine and blast furnace, reduction time and chemical composition) for produced sinter by using coke breeze with size - 3 + 1 mm and coke breeze granules were almost the same. The iron ore sinter which was produced by using coke breeze without sieving yielded low productivity for both sinter machine and blast furnace. Furthermore, using coke breeze without sieving in sintering of an iron ore decreases the vertical velocity of sinter machine and increases the reduction time...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Defined {{quantities}} of grades 1 and 4 Nigerian gum Arabic were mixed with refined kaolin clay as composite binders for sand cores. Foundry mechanical properties like green compressive strength, permeability, shatter index and baked tensile strength tests {{were carried out}} on core specimens to ascertain degree of suitability of the composites for sand casting. The green compressive strength, permeability and <b>shatter</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out on cylindrically shaped specimens using standard universal strength machine, permeability meter and shatter machine. Tensile strength specimens shaped like the figure eight were oven baked at 200 Â°C for 1 - 3 hours and cooled before tests. Core samples bonded with these composite binders were used for trial castings to ascertain its practical performance. The research showed that kaolin clay addition to gum Arabic improved permeability by about 18 %, shatter index by 5 %, green compressive strength by 8 % and baked tensile strength by 11 - 15 % over cores bonded with plain grades 1 and 4 Nigerian gum Arabic. On the other hand addition of gum Arabic to kaolin clay bonded cores improved green compressive strength by 15 % and baked tensile strength by 17 %, while it decreased shatter index and permeability by 6 % and 5 % respectively. Gum Arabic and kaolin clay composite binders gave cores that produced clean cast cavities which also collapsed easily after casting solidification...|$|R
40|$|Coconut shell charcoals havenât {{been used}} maximally {{by people in}} Bandarharjo whereas it can be {{utilized}} as activated charcoal, briquettes, etc which can increase its economic value. Previous research {{has not been able}} to answer the problem about the optimal size of charcoal particles and type of adhesive to get the briquettes which have a calorific value and durability of the best. The objective of this research is to study the optimal particle size, the best type of adhesive, the optimal concentration of adhesive, and briquette maker equipment design. Variables used in this research are type of adhesive (tapioca flour, wheat flour, molasses, and silicate), concentration of selected adhesive (10 %, 15 %, 20 %), and sieve size (20 mesh, 30 mesh, 40 mesh). The parameters used are the calorific value that measured by Boom calorimeter, the stability of briquettes, and briquettes hardness <b>tested</b> <b>shatter</b> index method. Result shows that tapioca flour is the best type of adhesive as compared with 3 other gluten (wheat flour, molasses, and silicate). The highest calorific value of 6748. 69 cal / g obtained in 20 % of adhesive with a size 20 mesh coconut shell charcoal. According to the <b>shatter</b> index <b>test,</b> the best briquette hardness is obtained on a variable 20 % adhesive with 40 mesh particle size because the particles lose only 0. 11 %...|$|R
40|$|Signiï¬cant {{quantities}} of sludge and slag are generated as waste material or by-product {{every day from}} steel industries. They usually contain considerable {{quantities of}} valuable metals and materials. It is generally possible to recover some values by physical or chemical mineral processing techniques. Briquetting is such a process to re-cycle this waste coke oven sludge as a useful fuel. In the present study experiments were conducted to determine optimum parameters of briquetting like binder content, water content, pressure and temperature of heat treatment. <b>shatter</b> resistance <b>tests</b> were carried out on briquettes obtained under different conditions.

40|$|Clay {{obtained}} from lgbokoda {{in the southwestern}} part of Nigeria has been analysed and developed as a binder for synthetic moulding sand. The analysis was compared with the analytical results obtained for the pre-treated bentonite clay imported from the U. S. A. and used by the Nigerian Foundries Ltd. (NFL). X-ray analysis indicated the presence of kaolin, illite and montmorillonite (parent mineral of bentonite), with kaolin having the highest percentage in the lgbokoda clay and montmorillonite was further confirmed by the flame test which shows the existence of exchangeable cations not present in kaolin. The effects of mixing varying amounts of clay, tempering water and sand on moulding properties were investigated. The green and dry strength and shatter index of the mixtures were determined. The green and the dry strength (both in shear and compression) of the lgbokoda test clay, mixed with the sub angular lagoon silica sand and determined at optimum water content, give good values for synthetic moulding sand. The <b>shatter</b> index <b>test</b> shows a decrease in collapsibility as the water content decreases at constant clay addition. lgbokoda clay is more collapsible but less tough than bentonite {{as shown by the}} shatter inde...|$|R

By Autumn 1969 Rolls-Royce {{was struggling to}} meet the performance guarantees to which it had committed: the engine had insufficient thrust, was over-weight and its fuel consumption was too high. The situation deteriorated further when in May 1970 the new Hyfil (a carbon fibre composite) fan stage, after passing every other <b>test,</b> <b>shattered</b> into pieces when a chicken was fired into it at high speed. Rolls had been developing a titanium blade as an insurance against difficulties with Hyfil, but this meant extra cost and more weight.

2500|$|In 2003 {{after the}} breakup of [...] during re-entry, the Columbia Accident Investigation Board {{conducted}} tests at Southwest Research Institute, which used an air gun to shoot foam blocks of similar size, mass and speed to that which struck Columbia at a test structure which mechanically replicated the orbiter wing leading edge. They removed a fiberglass panel from Enterprise wing to perform analysis of the material and attached it to the test structure, then shot a foam block at it. [...] While the panel was not broken {{as a result of}} the test, the impact was enough to permanently deform a seal. Since the reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) panel on Columbia had only 40% of the strength of the test panel from Enterprise, this result suggested that the RCC leading edge would have been <b>shattered.</b> Additional <b>tests</b> on the fiberglass were canceled in order not to risk damaging the test apparatus, and a panel from Discovery was tested to determine the effects of the foam on a similarly-aged RCC leading edge. On July 7, 2003, a foam impact test created a hole [...] in the protective RCC panel. The tests clearly demonstrated that a foam impact of the type Columbia sustained could seriously breach the protective RCC panels on the wing leading edge.|$|R
500|$|Since its release, Mulholland Drive has, {{according}} to film scholars Jay R. Letzner and Donald R. Ross, [...] "garnered both {{some of the}} harshest epithets {{and some of the}} most lavish praise in recent cinematic history". It received acclaim from many critics; even Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who had up til that point been primarily dismissive of Lynch's work, awarded the film four stars and commented, [...] "David Lynch has been working toward Mulholland Drive all of his career, and now that he's arrived there I forgive him for Wild at Heart (1990) and even Lost Highway (1997). At last his experiment doesn't <b>shatter</b> the <b>test</b> tubes. The movie is a surrealist dreamscape {{in the form of a}} Hollywood film noir, and the less sense it makes, the more we can't stop watching it." [...] Ebert subsequently added Mulholland Drive to his [...] "Great Films" [...] list in November 2012. In The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote that the film [...] "ranks alongside Fellini's 8Â½ and other auteurist fantasias as a monumental self-reflection" [...] and added, [...] "Looked at lightly, it is the grandest and silliest cinematic carnival to come along in quite some time: a lurching journey through one filmmaker's personal fun house. On a more serious level, its investigation into the power of movies pierces a void from which you can hear the screams of a ravenous demon whose appetites can never be slaked." [...] Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle called it [...] "exhilarating... for its dreamlike images and fierce, frequently reckless imagination" [...] and added, [...] "there's a mesmerizing quality to its languid pace, its sense of foreboding and its lost-in-time atmosphere... it holds us, spellbound and amused, for all of its loony and luscious, exasperating 146minutes [...] proves that Lynch is in solid formâand still an expert at pricking our nerves." ...|$|R
