A curve that is not contained in some plane is called a <b>skew</b> <b>curve.</b> The simplest example of a skew algebraic curve is the twisted cubic. One may also consider algebraic curves contained in the projective space and even algebraic curves that are defined independently to any embedding in an affine or projective space. This leads to the most general definition of an algebraic curve: ...|$|E

It {{is a fundamental}} example of a <b>skew</b> <b>curve.</b> It is essentially unique, up to projective transformation (the twisted cubic, therefore). It is {{generally considered to be}} the simplest example of a projective variety that is not linear or a hypersurface, and is given as such in most textbooks on algebraic geometry. It is the three-dimensional case of the rational normal curve, and is the image of a Veronese map of degree three on the projective line.|$|E

A space curve is a curve for which [...] is of three dimensions, usually Euclidean space; a <b>skew</b> <b>curve</b> [...] is a space curve which lies in no plane. These definitions of plane, space and skew curves apply also to real algebraic curves, although the above definition of a curve does not apply (a real algebraic curve may be disconnected).|$|E
30|$|The second {{main reason}} for the {{differences}} in forecasts in Fig.  1 is {{in the use of}} different forecast models. Currently, most studies have used different types of curve-fitting models, such as Verhulst model, growth curve model, Weng model, HCZ model, Hubbert model, and Richard’s model shown in Table  1. According to Wang and Feng (2016), the curve shape of models has considerable impact on forecast results and can be divided into symmetric or asymmetric based on their inflection point. 1 Asymmetric curves can be further divided into negatively skewed (inflection point >  0.5) and positively skewed shapes (inflection point <  0.5). Generally, the models with a positively <b>skewed</b> <b>curve</b> shape result in lower peak production and lower post-peak decline rate, while models with a negatively <b>skewed</b> <b>curve</b> result in higher peak production and higher post-peak decline rate (Wang and Feng 2016). Brandt (2007) investigated 67 post-peak regions and found that the actual production curves in most regions show a positive skew. Wang et al. (2011) also pointed out the positively <b>skewed</b> <b>curve</b> is better than the symmetric curve for production forecasting. Therefore, it is reasonable to exclude the results estimated by the models with a negatively <b>skewed</b> <b>curve.</b> Luckily, there are no negatively skewed curve-fitting models in Table  1. However, other curve-fitting models with different inflection points may also affect the forecast results. More detailed discussion of the impacts of curve-fitting models on forecast results can be found in Wang and Feng (2016).|$|R

Feasibility of the proposed model is demonstrated in G 7 stock markets. Additionally, two conventional random-coefficient frameworks, including time-varying betas derived from GARCH models and state-varying betas implied by Markov-switching models, are employed and subjected to comparative analysis. The empirical findings of this work are consistent with the following notions. First, the beta smile (beta <b>skew)</b> <b>curve</b> for the Italian, U. S. and U. K. (Canadian, French and German) markets. That is, covariance risk among global stock markets in extremely bull and/or bear market states is significantly higher than in stable periods. Additionally, the Japanese market provides a special case, and its beta estimate at extremely bust state is significantly lower, not higher than that at the middle region. Second, the quantile-varying betas are identified as possessing two key advantages. Specifically, the comparison of the system with quantile-varying betas against that with time-varying betas implied by GARCH models provides meaningful implications for correlation-volatility relationship among international stock markets. Furthermore, the quantile-varying beta design in this study relaxes a simple dual beta setting implied by Markov-switching models of Ramchand — Susmel (1998) and can identify dynamics of asymmetry in betas...|$|E
40|$|The {{human growth}} curve shows two (and only two) {{outstanding}} periods of accelerated growth—the circumnatal and the adolescent. The circumnatal growth cycle attains great velocity, which {{reaches a maximum}} {{at the time of}} birth. The curve of this cycle is best fitted by a theoretical <b>skew</b> <b>curve</b> of Pearson's Type I. It has a theoretical range of 44 months and a standard deviation of 5. 17 months. The modal velocity is 10. 2 kilos per year. The adolescent growth cycle has less maximum velocity and greater range in time than the circumnatal cycle. The best fitting theoretical curve is a normal frequency curve ranging over about 10 years {{with a standard deviation of}} about 21 months and a modal velocity of 4. 5 kilos per year. The two great growth accelerations are superimposed on a residual curve of growth which measures a substratum of growth out of which the accelerations arise. This probably extends from conception to 55 years, on the average. It is characterized by low velocity, averaging about 2 kilos per year from 2 to 12 years. It is interpreted as due to many growth operations coincident or closely blending in time. Our curve shows no third marked period of acceleration at between the 3 rd and 6 th years. The total growth in weight of the body is the sum of the weight of its constituent organs. In some cases these keep pace with the growth of the body as a whole; great accelerations of body growth are due to great accelerations in growth of the constituent organs. In other cases one of the organs of the body (like the thymus gland) may undergo a change in weight that is not in harmony with that of the body as a whole. The development of the weight in man is the resultant of many more or less elementary growth processes. These result in two special episodes of growth and numerous smaller, blending, growth operations. Hypotheses are suggested as to the basis of the special growth accelerations...|$|E

This thesis {{presents}} {{analysis results}} from a parametric study investigating the effects of abutment skew and horizontal alignment curvature on bridge reaction forces. Over 800 single-span box girder bridges were modeled using three-dimensional finite element analysis software. The effects of <b>skew</b> angle, <b>curve</b> angle, and a coupled skew-curve effect on abutment reactions in the obtuse corners of single-span box girder bridges {{were found to be}} significant. These results are compared with state-of-the-art bridge design practice and LRFD Specification procedures that provide guidance on designing bridges with skew and horizontal curvature. Interestingly, the results demonstrate that the obtuse corner reaction forces are greatly influence by the bridge aspect ratio across a wide variety of <b>skew</b> and <b>curve</b> angles. Furthermore, the horizontal alignment curvature has a large effect, even at very small alignment central angles. Moreover, the effect of skew angle is shown to be partially dependent on bridge curvature; although this coupling of the <b>skew</b> and <b>curve</b> effects is minimal at small skew angles. The bearing stiffness was also varied, which had a large effect on the reactions of <b>skewed</b> and <b>curved</b> bridges.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} trend to use highly skewed bridges. There are also many {{advantages}} to making all bridges integral, even highly skewed bridges. Many agencies have set limits on maximum skew on integral bridges to avoid translation and wingwall damage. Many designers in Utah have incorporated “finwalls ” into the design. These finwalls can minimize translation and are sized for full seismic loads and can handle significant loads. It appears that the problems seen are “restraint problems ” with the system not moving as expected and forcing large loads back into the superstructure. The resultant forces in <b>skewed</b> or <b>skewed</b> <b>curved</b> bridge are offset and appear to be forming a force couple which is putting moment into the superstructure system.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Analysis of {{the first}} {{reported}} complete genome sequence of Bifidobacterium longum NCC 2705, an actinobacterium colonizing the gastrointestinal tract, uncovered its proteomic relatedness to Streptomyces coelicolor and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, a rapid scrutiny by genometric methods revealed a genome organization totally different from all so far sequenced high-GC Gram-positive chromosomes. RESULTS: Generally, the cumulative GC- and ORF orientation <b>skew</b> <b>curves</b> of prokaryotic genomes consist of two linear segments of opposite slope: the minimum and the maximum of the curves correspond to the origin and the terminus of chromosome replication, respectively. However, analyses of the B. longum NCC 2705 chromosome yielded six, instead of two, linear segments, while its dnaA locus, usually associated with the origin of replication, was not located at the minimum of the curves. Furthermore, the coorientation of gene transcription with replication was very low. Comparison with closely related actinobacteria strongly suggested that the chromosome of B. longum was misassembled, and the identification of two pairs of relatively long homologous DNA sequences offers the possibility for an alternative genome assembly proposed here below. By genometric criteria, this configuration displays all of the characters common to bacteria, in particular to related high-GC Gram-positives. In addition, it {{is compatible with the}} partially sequenced genome of DJO 10 A B. longum strain. Recently, a corrected sequence of B. longum NCC 2705, with a configuration similar to the one proposed here below, has been deposited in GenBank, confirming our predictions.

40|$|AbstractIn Part I, a {{notation}} called Matrix-Tensor Notation {{was introduced}} for rectilinear orthogonal coordinates. Part II discusses how the same notation is equally efficient for vectors and 2 nd order tensors in skew bases and <b>skew</b> <b>curved</b> coordinates. Without considering coordinates first, vectors and 2 nd order tensors {{are described in}} skew bases, covariant and contravariant descriptions being distinguished similar to tensor notation. A consistent interpretation of deformation and strain in terms of skew bases is given. The use of the transpose symbol complicates the matrix algebra, but integrates it with tensor algebra which {{makes it possible to}} interpret customary tensor equations as relations in space with all the advantages that an isomorphism with Euclidean space has. It is demonstrated how different metrics can be assigned arbitrarily to define higher-dimensional orthogonal vectors in abstract higher-dimensional space. A consistent notation is given to distinguish between subspace and subbase. To write higher order tensors as matrices, or 2 nd order tensors as vectors, partial transpose is introduced, which is a formal stretching operation to write any higher order tensor product operation as matrix-vector product. The description of the variable bases in generally curved coordinates is given in this notation, together with the corresponding notation for the partial differentiation rules. The vector operations grad, div and curl are discussed and an almost-physical notation for the Christoffel symbols is given. However, the replacement of tensor notation for higher than second order tensors by Matrix Tensor Notation is not feasible. A version of Matrix Tensor Notation that merges with the customary printed form is presented in an Appendix. Further applications are deferred to Part III, applying the new notation to curved coordinates in function space, and the equations of mechanics projected on finite-dimensional subspaces...|$|R

30|$|For {{the wing}} support bearings, {{vertical}} stiffness is desirable to prevent excessive deflection of the bearing {{and the corresponding}} bending of the rails. If a bearing type is selected that has different rotation capacities about different axes, the bearing should be oriented so that its largest capacity is available for rotation about the axis AC in Fig.  6, since that is the axis of applied rotation. Elastomeric bearings often provide the most economical support system and are particularly attractive when the primary axes of rotation are unclear, such as in a <b>skewed</b> or <b>curved</b> bridge. However, their vertical and rotational stiffnesses are linked, in that a high vertical stiffness requires a high shape factor, which in turn leads to a high rotational stiffness.

We sought to review the clinical impact of the new Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System v 2 (PI-RADS) and compare those results to our proposed Simplified Qualitative System (SQS) score with respect to detection of prostate cancers and clinically significant prostate cancers. All patients who underwent multiparametric prostate MRI (mpMRI) had their images interpreted using PI-RADS v 1 and SQS score. PI-RADS v 2 was calculated from prospectively collected data points. Patients with positive mpMRIs were then referred by their urologists for enrollment in an IRB-approved prospective phase III trial of mpMRI-Ultrasound (MR/TRUS) fusion biopsy of suspicious lesions. Standard 12 -core biopsy was performed at the same setting. Clinical data were collected prospectively. 1060 patients were imaged using mpMRI at our institution during the study period. 341 participants were then referred to the trial. 312 participants underwent MR/TRUS fusion biopsy of 452 lesions and {{were included in the}} analysis. 202 participants had biopsy-proven cancer (64. 7 %) and 206 (45. 6 %) lesions were positive for cancer. Distribution of cancer detected at each score produced a Gaussian distribution for SQS while PI-RADS demonstrates a negatively <b>skewed</b> <b>curve</b> with 82. 1 % of cases being scored as a 4 or 5. Patient-level data demonstrated AUC of 0. 702 (95 % CI 0. 65 to 0. 73) for PI-RADS and 0. 762 (95 % CI 0. 72 to 0. 81) for SQS (p< 0. 0001) with respect to the detection of prostate cancer. The analysis for clinically significant prostate cancer at a per lesion level resulted in an AUC of 0. 725 (95 % CI 0. 69 to 0. 76) and 0. 829 (95 % CI 0. 79 to 0. 87) for the PI-RADS and SQS score, respectively (p< 0. 0001). mpMRI is a useful tool in the workup of patients at risk for prostate cancer, and serves as a platform to guide further evaluation with MR/TRUS fusion biopsy. SQS score provided a more normal distribution of scores and yielded a higher AUC than PI-RADS v 2. However until our findings are validated, we recommend reporting of detailed sequence-specific findings. This will allow for prospectively collected data to be utilized in determining the impact of ongoing changes to these scoring systems as our understanding of mpMRI interpretation evolves...|$|R
40|$|Frequency {{distribution}} curves can be {{indicative of}} the dynamics and evolutionary development of geomorphological systems. Normally distributed geomorphological data are a reliable indicator of the equilibrium fluctuations prevalent within such systems. This occurs, for example, when a delicate balance is established between various types of landforms and geomorphological processes. Landforms that exist in this geomorphological steady state can be properly called “equilibrium” structures. They show no permanent trends of either growth or destruction. On the contrary, a positively <b>skewed</b> frequency distribution <b>curve</b> indicates a type of non-equilibrium conditions and non-linear relationships within geomorphological systems, {{which may be the}} result of major external energy inputs (particularly from tectonic uplift). This, in turn, gives rise to new and more complex higher-order landforms. These represent structures of growth, or evolution. Alternatively, a negatively <b>skewed</b> frequency distribution <b>curve,</b> also being a consequence of non-equilibrium conditions, indicates a lack of free energy in the system, which induces destruction of the existing landforms. Such landforms represent structures of degeneration. The fluvial landscape in the northwestern part of Hrvatsko Zagorje, portrayed in terms of an open system, has been used as the geomorphological framework for this study, the primary purpose of which was to apply frequency distribution curves in the interpretation of the processes influencing the creation and destruction of the landscape.

While the machine learning community has become aware of the problem of skewed data for training classifiers, little {{attention has been paid to}} how skew may bias performance metrics. To address this question, we conducted experiments using both simulated classifiers and three major databases that differ in size, type of FACS coding, and degree of skew. We evaluated influence of skew on both threshold metrics (Accuracy, F-score, Cohen’s kappa, and Krippendorf’s alpha) and rank metrics (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and precision-recall curve). With exception of area under the ROC curve, all were attenuated by skewed distributions, in many cases, dramatically so. While ROC was unaffected by <b>skew,</b> precision-recall <b>curves</b> suggest that ROC may mask poor performance.

Using Ljung–Box Q(18) model statistics is 14.645, significance is 0.477 and degree of freedom is 15. ARIMA (1, 0, 0) model fitted and boundary lines at 95  % confidence limits. Predicted, LCL, UCL and residual values of COD are 8.1648, − 2.1331, 18.4629, and 0.3341.|$|R
40|$|The {{determination}} of pulsation mode and distance for field Cepheids {{is a complicated}} problem best resolved by a luminosity estimate. For illustration a technique based on spectroscopic luminosity discrimination {{is applied to the}} 4. 47 d s-Cepheid FF Aql. Line ratios in high dispersion spectra of the variable yield values of =- 3. 40 +- 0. 02 s. e. (+- 0. 04 s. d.), average effective temperature Teff= 6195 +- 24 K, and intrinsic color (-) o = + 0. 506 +- 0. 007, corresponding to a reddening of E(B-V) = 0. 25 +- 0. 01, or E(B-V) (B 0) = 0. 26 +- 0. 01. The <b>skewed</b> light <b>curve,</b> intrinsic color, and luminosity of FF Aql are consistent with fundamental mode pulsation for a small amplitude classical Cepheid on the blue side of the instability strip, not a sinusoidal pulsator. A distance of 413 +- 14 pc is estimated from the Cepheid's angular diameter in conjunction with a mean radius of = 39. 0 +- 0. 7 Rsun inferred from its luminosity and effective temperature. The dust extinction towards FF Aql is described by a ratio of total-to-selective extinction of Rv=Av/E(B-V) = 3. 16 +- 0. 34 according to the star's apparent distance modulus.
