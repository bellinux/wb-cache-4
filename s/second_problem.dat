5|$|The {{planetary}} {{model of}} the atom had two significant shortcomings. The first is that, unlike planets orbiting a sun, electrons are charged particles. An accelerating electric charge is known to emit electromagnetic waves according to the Larmor formula in classical electromagnetism. An orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in {{a small fraction of}} a second. The <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> was that the planetary model could not explain the highly peaked emission and absorption spectra of atoms that were observed.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{was later}} {{introduced}} {{to amend the}} type of data collected and stored in the National Register of Electors. On 17 May 2007, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada Jennifer Stoddart appeared before the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs regarding Bill C-31, An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the Public Service Employment Act submitting a letter in which she criticised the proposed changes to the Elections Act. One of the problems was the inclusion of an elector's date of birth in the voter lists sent to polling stations on election day for use by polling clerks and scrutineers; Stoddart stated that verification of an elector's birth year would be sufficient. The <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> she raised was inclusion of the date of birth in the voter lists sent to each candidate for all electoral districts in Canada, and also to all political parties.|$|E
5|$|Mail {{service was}} chaotic during the stampede. Apart {{from the number}} of prospectors, two major {{obstacles}} stood in its way. To begin with, any mail from America to Dawson City was sent to Juneau in South-east Alaska before being sent through Dawson and then down the Yukon to Circle City. From here it was then distributed by the US Post Office back up to Dawson. The huge distances involved resulted in delays of several months and frequently the loss of protective envelopes and their addresses. The <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> was in Dawson itself, which initially lacked a post office and therefore relied on two stores and a saloon to act as informal delivery points. The NWMP were tasked to run the mail system by October 1897, but they were ill-trained to do so. Up to 5,700 letters might arrive in a single shipment, all of which had to be collected in person from the post office. This resulted in huge queues, with claimants lining up outside the office for up to three days. Those who had no time and could afford it would pay others to stand in line for them, preferably a woman since they were allowed to get ahead in line out of politeness. Postage stamps, like paper in general, were scarce and rationed to two per customer. By 1899, trained postal staff took over mail delivery and relieved the NWMP of this task.|$|E

5|$|The {{proximity}} fuze {{had been}} pioneered by Alan Butement. The {{idea was that}} if a shell could explode when it was near an enemy aircraft, a near miss would be nearly as effective as a direct hit. The technical problem was to miniaturise a radar set, and make it sturdy enough to be fired from a gun barrel. The <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> had been solved by the Germans; a dud German bomb was salvaged that had valves that could withstand the acceleration. Plans {{were given to the}} Americans by the Tizard Mission, but work continued in Britain, where a team was established at Christchurch under Charles Drummond Ellis in February 1942. Work proceeded fitfully, and by 1943, production was still two years away. On a visit to the United States in November 1943, Cockcroft discussed adapting the American proximity fuze for British use with Merle Tuve. As a result, 150,000 fuzes for QF 3.7-inch AA guns were ordered on 16 January 1944. The fuzes arrived in time to engage the V-1 flying bombs in August 1944, shooting down 97 per cent of them. For his services, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in June 1944.|$|E

25|$|In fluid dynamics, Stokes problem {{also known}} as Stokes <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> {{is a problem of}} {{determining}} the flow created by an oscillating plate, named after Sir George Stokes.

25|$|The {{first of}} these {{problems}} is relatively minor as most ordinal scales with an even number of response can be extended (or reduced) by a single value to give an odd number of possible responses.

25|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, two {{problems}} were identified before heavier-than-air flight could be realized. The {{first was the}} creation of low-drag, high-lift aerodynamic wings. The <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> was how to determine the power needed for sustained flight. During this time, the groundwork was laid down for modern day fluid dynamics and aerodynamics, with other less scientifically-inclined enthusiasts testing various flying machines with little success.|$|E

25|$|In logic, the <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> on David Hilbert's list of open {{problems}} {{presented in}} 1900 was {{to prove that}} the axioms of arithmetic are consistent. Gödel's second incompleteness theorem, proved in 1931, showed that this was not possible – at least not within arithmetic itself. Hilbert's tenth problem was to determine whether a given polynomial Diophantine equation with integer coefficients has an integer solution. In 1970, Yuri Matiyasevich proved that this could not be done.|$|E
25|$|The <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> {{is due to}} food {{composition}} and geometry, and must be addressed by the cook, by arranging the food so that it absorbs energy evenly, and periodically testing and shielding any parts of the food that overheat. In some materials with low thermal conductivity, where dielectric constant increases with temperature, microwave heating can cause localized thermal runaway. Under certain conditions, glass can exhibit thermal runaway in a microwave {{to the point of}} melting.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the status of}} the first and second {{problems}} is even more complicated: there is not any clear mathematical consensus as to whether the results of Gödel (in the case of the <b>second</b> <b>problem),</b> or Gödel and Cohen (in the case of the first problem) give definitive negative solutions or not, since these solutions apply to a certain formalization of the problems, which is not necessarily the only possible one.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two major}} issues with this set, however. The first one {{is that in the}} two-die option of the game, the first chain should stay exactly the same {{in order to make the}} game nontransitive. In practice, though, D {{actually}} beats C. The <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> is that the third player would have to be allowed to choose between the one-die option and the two-die option – which may be seen as unfair to other players.|$|E
25|$|The <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> {{facing the}} boats was the {{tendency}} of the cylinders in the diesel engines to overheat. This problem was never rectified and the cylinders would eventually crack after six hours of running at full speed. This was due to early engine design and metallurgical inadequacies. The third and final problem was temperamental emptying of tanks during diving or surfacing. This was rectified by the refitting of faulty valves. After refitting, the ships performed various patrol and training cruises along the west coast.|$|E
25|$|The <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> is {{that public}} spending, which rose steeply in the 2000s, was now unsustainable. The total Irish budget deficit as of December 2010, stood at 93.4 billion with General Government Debt at 148.6 billion or 94.2% of GDP. As {{it was not}} clear how much money would be needed to {{revitalise}} the banks – to clear their debts and supply them with enough money to start lending again – the international markets were unwilling to lend Ireland money at an interest rate it could afford.|$|E

25|$|Two {{problems}} ensue {{from the}} multiplicity of transcription systems used for Tlingit. One {{is that there are}} many of them, thus requiring any reader to learn each individual system depending on what sources are used. The <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> is that most transcriptions made before Franz Boas's study of Tlingit have numerous mistakes in them, particularly because of misinterpretations of the short vowels and ejective consonants. Thus it is important to check any given transcription against similar words in other systems, or ideally against a modern work postdating Naish and Story's work in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevailing}} {{economic theory}} in effect during early colonial days was mercantilism, {{as it was}} throughout most of Western Europe. The economy struggled at first due to difficulties in cultivating {{the land and the}} lack of a stable monetary system. Governor Lachlan Macquarie solved the <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> by creating two coins from every Spanish silver dollar in circulation. The economy was clearly capitalist in nature by the 1840s as the proportion of free settlers increased, the maritime and wool industries flourished, and the powers of the East India Company were curtailed.|$|E
25|$|The <b>second</b> <b>problem,</b> the {{exhaustion}} of the high-content surface ores, required technological innovations. Hydraulic power took on increased importance {{because of the}} construction of large refining centers. By 1621 a system of artificial lakes with a storage capacity of several million tons provided a steady supply of water for refineries. With the labor and technological problems resolved, silver mining flourished. By the middle of the 17th century, silver mining at Potosí had become so important that the city had the largest population in the Western Hemisphere, approximately 160,000 inhabitants.|$|E
