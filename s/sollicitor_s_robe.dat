40|$|The Roman de Thèbes and Chrétien de Troyes 2 ̆ 7 Erec et Enide are romances of an Anglo-Norman tradition, {{which were}} crafted {{during the second}} half of the 12 th-century. The Roman de Thèbes, most {{probably}} created during the 1150 s, is an anonymous reworking of Statius 2 ̆ 7 first-century Thebaïd and relates the story of the battle between Greeks and Thebans, which breaks out because Oedipus 2 ̆ 7 sons fight over their inherited lands. Chrétien de Troyes 2 ̆ 7 Erec et Enide, an Arthurian romance, was created in ca. 1170 and culminates with the coronation of Erec as the new king of his lands. Both of these texts therefore deal with questions of land inheritance and were, very significantly, written during important stages in Henry II 2 ̆ 7 s career, as it was during this time frame that Henry II (1133 - 1189) gained dominance in the British Isles as well as in western continental Europe. My thesis will discuss these works separately, devoting the subsequent section to the ekphrastic accounts featured in the Roman de Thèbes. This chapter will focus on mappa mundi and Amphiareus 2 ̆ 7 chariot and will discuss how these moments mirror the ambitions of Henry II during the early stages of his reign. Moreover, the penultimate section will then move on to discuss the coronation scene featured in Chrétien de Troyes 2 ̆ 7 Erec et Enide, with a special emphasis on Erec 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>robe.</b> This discussion will also examine how this scene mirrors the historical occurrences in of the late 1160 s, during which time Henry tried to establish his authority in Brittanny. Ultimately, I will attempt to weave these moments together to provide a comprehensive reading of these ekphrastic accounts...|$|R

40|$|The term sashiko {{refers to}} the {{stitching}} {{of one or more}} layers of cloth with a simple running stitch and can also apply to the completed fabric. Sashiko is the noun of the verb sasu, meaning to pierce. Sashiko probably was initially a way to recycle or extend the life of cloth. Among the textiles in the Shoso-in, the Imperial Repository built circa 752 to preserve thousands of objects of art and other belongings of the Emperor Shomu, is an 8 th Century 2 ̆ 2 distant mountain 2 ̆ 2 pattern monk 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>robe</b> covered with a purple silk running stitch. This running stitch is superfluous to the actual structure of the robe. This is a development of an earlier ritual robe, evolved {{to the point where the}} stitches have lost their original function to strengthen and attach the patches of cloth, but retained to give the appearance of the original 2 ̆ 2 robe of rags. 2 ̆ 2 This is the oldest example of sashiko extant in Japan. There is a gap in recorded history from this point until the 17 th Century when other sashiko are mentioned. Sashiko was done throughout Japan, primarily by women. It is not known to have been done commercially with the possible exception of some of the firemen clothing. Often it was done by and for people who were too poor to buy new cloth. Sashiko developed from necessity rather than as a luxury, so the art of sashiko wasn 2 ̆ 7 t highly competitive, with some exceptions. That is, the product was not regarded as a statement of fashion. Originally a practical technique for making cloth thicker, warmer, and more durable, sashiko can also be purely decorative. Clothing that has been over stitched is not only very strong, but warm. Therefore, it was reasonable to reinforce the cloth by stitching before the cloth wore out. Presently it is done on new cloth, for garments and textiles to be sold in folk craft shops. Typically, sashiko stitching is done with white cotton thread on an indigo-dyed fabric. Most sashiko uses one strand of thread through the needle, doubled so that both strands account for the stitch although it can be done with a single strand. The length of the stitch varies with the number of layers being stitched together. Keeping the stitches even in length, as well as straight, requires skill and practise. There are approximately five to ten stitches per inch (five to ten stitches per 2. 5 cm.) with certain districts noted for having particularly fine stitching. Sashiko was done on balanced weave textiles, that is the warp and weft are the same thickness and weight of thread. Although the ground fabric threads were not usually counted, the stitches were. Within a pattern, per line, the same number and length of stitch is held constant and is consistent (from point A to B are always x number of stitches and the length of each stitch is held constant). Many patterns consist of straight lines that intersect at right angles, so counting the stitches made the patterns quite exact. At the point of intersection either the stitching threads cross creating a pattern, or the absence of the threads create a pattern such as a star or the center of a flower. Sashiko can be either a single repeating pattern or a combination of several patterns on one fabric...|$|R
40|$|In {{nineteenth century}} courts of the khanates and oasis cities of Central Asia, rulers, wealthy merchants and other well-to-do {{men and women}} wore boldly {{patterned}} warp-ikat and ikat velvet robes, often stunning in their patterning and variety. Nineteenth century ikat costumes and other textiles are well documented in private and museum collections today and have {{been the focus of}} considerable attention by collectors, dealers, and scholars since the 1970 <b>s.</b> This <b>robe</b> is from a Turkish collection of Central Asian ikats given to the Textile Museum in Washington D. C. in 2005 by the collector Murad Megalli (Fig. 1). Nineteenth century ikat textiles are also well documented in photographs such as an 1871 - 72 portrait of the last Khan of Kokand (Fig. 2). These dynamic ikat textiles appear to have burst upon the scene in splendid complexity {{in the early years of}} the nineteenth century supported by the wealth and sophisticated taste of the khanate courts in what is today Uzbekistan. Their use spread and by the end of the nineteenth century, atlas was worn not only by a wealthy elite but, in simpler versions and various garment styles, by many peoples throughout Central Asia. They were – and are - also worn by the Turkic Uighur people in what is today Xinjiang China. In 1865 Ya’kub Beg, commander in chief of the armies of the Khan of Kokand in the Ferghana Valley, marched over the Pamir mountains to what was then Chinese Turkestan, conquered Kashgar and the surrounding territories and established a lavish court supplied by ikat weavers and other artisans brought with him from the Ferghana Valley. A few years later, when the tea merchant and mountaineer Robert Shaw visited the cities of Khotan, Yarkand and Kashgar on the branch of the old Silk Road that skirted the Taklamakan desert to the south, he was presented with several splendid ikat coats in the Uzbek style, some of which are now in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London...|$|R

Taj je, naime, popravak otkrio mnoge do sada „nečitke“ pojedinosti ove tempere na drvu i omogućio utvrditi da se radi o djelu kasne faze istaknutog „Schiavonea“ iz 15. stoljeća Jurja Čulinovića (1433 / 36 - 1504) kao sto je bio G. Gamulin iznio 1963. - 1964. hipotetični prijedlog. Važno je istaknuti i činjenicu da je ovo djelo jedini sačuvani Čulinovićev rad u zavičaju. The article {{deals with}} the {{painting}} of the » Virgin Mary and Child on a Throne« from the Franciscan monastery of St. Lawrence in Šibenik, which was recently successfully restored by Stanko Alajbeg of the Split National Service Preservation of Cultural and Natural Heritage. G. Gamulin suggested in 1963 - 1964 that this tempera on wood belonged 2 ̆ 7 to the late period {{in the work of}} the eminent and distinguished »Schiavone« painter of the Quattrocento, Juraj Čulinović (1433 / 36 - 1504) from Skradin. In 1959 the painting was restored to its supposed original appearance and accompanied by a detailed description presenting the principle characteristics of the painting in a new light, particularly emphasising the qualities of the rendering of the face of the Madonna, the fi gure of the baby Jesus and the delicate tonal handling of Mary 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> green <b>robe</b> and the blue clouded sky. Following a brief biography of Juraj Čulinović, the author subjects the painting to an indepth comparative analysis, drawing parallels with the artist 2 ̆ 7 s frescoes in Padua completed after his apprenticeship in the workshop of Francesco Squarcione at the time of Donatello 2 ̆ 7 s residence in that city. The differences between the works are also mentioned showing the work to be part of the artist 2 ̆ 7 s late Šibenik period beginning after one of his shorter visits to Italy when he would have seen the work of Giovanni Bellini from around 1470. The analysis finally confirms that the now »legible« painting does indeed belong to the artist 2 ̆ 7 s later career, when his output was considerably diminished and that the painting is, as far as it is known, the only preserved work by this artist in his homeland...|$|R
