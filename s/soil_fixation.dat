50|$|The main coconut-producing {{area in the}} Middle East is the Dhofar {{region of}} Oman, {{but they can be}} grown all along the Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea, and Red Sea coasts, because these seas are {{tropical}} and provide enough humidity (through seawater evaporation) for coconut trees to grow. The young coconut plants need to be nursed and irrigated with drip pipes until they are old enough (stem bulb development) to be irrigated with brackish water or seawater alone, after which they can be replanted on the beaches. In particular, the area around Salalah maintains large coconut plantations similar to those found across the Arabian Sea in Kerala. The reasons why coconut are cultivated only in Yemen's Al Mahrah and Hadramaut governorates and in the Sultanate of Oman, but not in other suitable areas in the Arabian Peninsula, may originate from the fact that Oman and Hadramaut had long dhow trade relations with Burma, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Africa, and Zanzibar, as well as southern India and China. Omani people needed the coir rope from the coconut fiber to stitch together their traditional high seas-going dhow vessels in which nails were never used. The 'know how' of coconut cultivation and necessary <b>soil</b> <b>fixation</b> and irrigation may have found its way into Omani, Hadrami and Al-Mahra culture by people who returned from those overseas areas.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Aim: To {{investigate}} the biomechanical ability and utility of Sabina valgaris Ant. roots for <b>soil</b> <b>fixation</b> in arid and semiarid coal mining regions. Methods: Direct rapid shear and tensile strengths of shallow soil (~ 1. 5 m) root samples were examined at 12. 5 kPa, 25 kPa, 50 kPa, and 100 kPa. Results: Soil samples exhibited mean water content of 4. 34 % and dry density of 1. 35 g/cm 3, though saturated soil (46 %) water content was 17. 2 %. Cohesion of Sabina valgaris root-soil composites gradually increased with root diameter (P 0. 05). Friction coefficients of soil-root and soil-soil interfaces were similar, obeying Mohr-Coulomb theory and exhibiting a sclerotic curve. Shear strength of Sabina valgaris Ant. roots were consistently higher than pure soil.

ChinaInternational audienceBackground: The {{contribution}} of vegetation to shallow-slope stability is of major importance in landslide-prone regions. However, existing slope stability models use only limited plant root architectural parameters. This study aims {{to provide a}} chain of tools useful for determining the {{contribution of}} tree roots to soil reinforcement. Methods: Three-dimensional digitizing in situ was used to obtain accurate root system architecture data for mature Quercus alba in two forest stands. These data were used as input to tools developed, which analyse the spatial position of roots, topology and geometry. The contribution of roots to soil reinforcement was determined by calculating additional soil cohesion using the limit equilibrium model, and the factor of safety (FOS) using an existing slope stability model, Slip 4 Ex. Key Results: Existing models may incorrectly estimate the additional soil cohesion provided by roots, as the spatial position of roots crossing the potential slip surface is usually not taken into account. However, most soil reinforcement by roots occurs close to the tree stem and is negligible at a distance > 1 · 0 m from the tree, and therefore global values of FOS for a slope do {{not take into account}} local slippage along the slope. Conclusions: Within a forest stand on a landslide-prone slope, <b>soil</b> <b>fixation</b> by roots can be minimal between uniform rows of trees, leading to local soil slippage. Therefore, staggered rows of trees would improve overall slope stability, as trees would arrest the downward movement of soil.

40|$|In tree ecosystems, tree fine roots (defined {{as those}} of {{diameter}} ≤ 2 mm) comprise only {{a small proportion of}} total biomass, but play the most active and fundamental role in both tree functioning (via water and nutrition uptakes) and carbon flux dynamics (via respiration, exudation and high turn-over rate). These processes have a beneficial effect on the promotion of underground biodiversity, as fine roots with their rhizospheres can provide “cradle effect” for sheltering and nourishing soil micro- and macro-organisms in both direct (e. g. mycorrhizal fungi growth on roots) and indirect (e. g. creating soil organic matter) manners. As a result, in order to better explore underground biodiversity repartition and evaluate its service, a reliable characterisation of the spatial distribution of fine roots is indispensable. The spatial distribution of fine root can be served either as a proxy of repartition of certain fauna or as an environmental factor to be correlated with biodiversity indicators. However, our knowledge concerning fine roots distribution is still limited, partially {{due to the lack of}} effective root modelling and data analysis methods. This proposal aims to introduce and highlight a set of methodologies suitable to quantitatively describe root spatial distribution. The methods are statistically based and easy to use in conjunction with conventional root sampling techniques (e. g. root trench, coring). Fine root density from trees at a given point can be modelled by a modified logistic function parametrised by tree dimension and position, presence of obstacles between a tree and the given point, and root competition level with roots from understory species. For fine root vertical distribution, by introducing a recently published piecewise linear model’, namely “hockey stick model,” an ecological threshold served to distinguish shallow rooting zone and deep rooting zone, might be thus detected with statistical diagnostic. Applying a log-normal function and Gompertz function allows us to better fit the shape of root diameter spectrum (cumulative root density with increasing diameter). Regarding the phenomenon that fine root distribution exhibits a pattern of patchiness (or namely root nuggets), application of geo-statistical approaches allows us to better quantify aggregation and dispersion rate of roots within/amongst nuggets. In the ongoing projects ANR ECOSFIX (Ecosystem Services of Roots – Hydraulic Redistribution, Carbon Sequestration and <b>Soil</b> <b>Fixation)</b> and ARANGE FP 7 (Advanced multifunctional management of European mountain forests), these above methods have been successfully applied to several French tree ecosystems, varying from heterogeneous mixed mountain forests (with low intervention intensity), to homogenous agroforests and plantations (with high intervention intensity).

Bibliography: leaves [127]- 138. xiv, 138 leaves ill., diagrs., tables (2 folded) The soil is a {{supplier}} of phosphorus; and. in addition, it governs phosphorus availability through complex reactions between itself and fertilizer phosphorus. Conservative phosphate fertilization of some soils {{has not always}} effectively provided phosphorus for crop plants. Low efficiency of phosphorus recovery {{has long been an}} important, practical agricultural problem and has led many workers to study the problem of phosphorus immobilization. It is this immobilization which is believed largely responsible for low phosphate fertilizer recovery by plants and for low crop yields. Low recovery of added phosphorus by agronomic crops is a serious problem inmost Hawaiian soils. Experiments conducted by Ayres (1934) and by Chu and Sherman (1952) have shown that phosphorus fixation occurs very rapidly or even almost immediately in many Hawaiian soils. Fixation of phosphorus and thus its availability, can be regulated to some extent by certain management practices of soils. Heavy phosphorus applications are sometimes advocated to saturate the phosphorus fixation complex in soils with excess of phosphorus for plant utilization (Younge, 1961; Younge and Moomaw: 1960). Sometimes also the correct choice of a chemical compound to supply phosphorus may improve fertilizer efficiency. When the factors responsible for phosphorus fixation are understood more completely. a greater measure of fertilizer efficiency will be attained. Direct application of phosphate fertilizer material to the plant could be one solution to the <b>soil</b> <b>fixation</b> problem if a number of difficulties are overcome. Among these are: physiological burning of leaves and stems, poor recovery of added phosphorus, and lack of uniform distribution of the added nutrient within the plant. Some of these difficulties may be overcome by using suitable fertilizer material, controlled pH, proper concentration, and efficient means of application. It is widely believed that the influence of lime on phosphorus availability depends on the solubility and mobility of aluminum. The use of soil amendments such as applications of lime to acid soils may be useful in reducing the solubility and mobility of aluminum. It is commonly believed that phosphorus availability to plants increases as soils are limed close to pH 7. 0; but this generalization may not apply in the tropics. Greene (1954) has reported that results from liming in the tropics have usually been unsatisfactory, and he concluded that the question of liming tropical soils should be reconsidered. In this study on phosphorus; one of the hypotheses proposed for testing was: when lime is applied before phosphorus, phosphorus reacts with the precipitated aluminum and forms a surface complex which rapidly equilibrates with the soil solution. And further, when lime is applied after the application of phosphorus, the phosphorus interacts with the surface and becomes covered by the precipitated aluminum. The objectives of the various experiments performed and reported in this thesis are summarized as follows: 1. to determine the influence of two isotopes; P 31 and P 32,phosphorus compounds, rates, and methods of phosphorus application on the availability of native and applied phosphorus in diverse soil systems. 2. to determine the availability of soil phosphorus ("A" value of Fried and Dean; 1952) as influenced by sources and various times of lime and phosphorus application in several Hawaiian soils. 3. to determine the influence of liming and phosphate fertilization on the intensity of phosphorus fixation by soils with diverse mineral systems, such as amorphous hydrated oxides, goethitegibbsite; kaolin (1 : 1 clays), and montmorillonite (2 : 1 clays), in various tropical soils...|$|E
40|$|Numerous leaf {{analyses}} {{had indicated}} that K uptake by winter cut cane (May to August) growing on Ca and Mg saturated clays of the Eastern Transvaal lowveld is often severely depressed, despite apparently adequate amounts of available soil K. Five trials {{were conducted to}} determine whether winter cut cane would respond to early (August) or late (October) applications of K fertilizer, and whether K recommendations for irrigated cane growing on these base saturated soils would require revision. Early application of K fertilizer gave greater sucrose yields than those obtained when K application was delayed until October. Responses to K fertilizer were related to foliar K levels and various soil properties. The results confirmed the need to increase the current K threshold value for this category of soils. The effects of <b>soil</b> K <b>fixation,</b> and seasonal changes in soil temperature and moisture content on K uptake were assessed and the results used to develop a seasonal correction factor for leafK values during {{the early part of}} the growing season...|$|R
50|$|Biological soil crusts are {{communities}} of living organisms {{on the soil}} surface in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. They are found throughout the world with varying species composition and cover depending on topography, soil characteristics, climate, plant community, microhabitats, and disturbance regimes. Biological soil crusts perform important ecological roles including carbon <b>fixation,</b> nitrogen <b>fixation,</b> <b>soil</b> stabilization, alter soil albedo and water relations, and affect germination and nutrient levels in vascular plants. They can be damaged by fire, recreational activity, grazing, and other disturbance and can require long time periods to recover composition and function. Biological soil crusts are also known as cryptogamic, microbiotic, microphytic, or cryptobiotic soils.|$|R
40|$|Background {{and aims}} In Malawi, {{strategies}} are being sought to boost maize production through improvements in soil fertility. This study assessed {{the impact of}} intercropping maize (Zea mays) with pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) in Lixisols of Malawi on yield, biological N <b>fixation,</b> <b>soil</b> aggregation, and P forms within soil aggregates. Methods Maize and pigeon pea were grown intercropped in pots, {{with varying degrees of}} root interaction {{in order to understand the}} relative importance of biochemical versus physical rhizospheric interactions. Following harvest, soils were separated into aggregate fractions using wet-sieving, and the nutrient content of all fractions was assessed. Results The proportion of macroaggregates and microaggregates increased by 52 and 111...|$|R
