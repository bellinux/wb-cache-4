5|$|Part of {{the rebellious}} forces held out, however, and their stronghold was the {{virtually}} impregnable Kenilworth Castle.

It was in this situation that the papal legate Ottobuono Fieschi exerted his influence, to make the king pursue a more conciliatory policy. In August, the king summoned a parliament at Kenilworth, where the siege was ongoing. He commissioned a number of earls, barons and bishops to draft a treaty of reconciliation.|$|E
