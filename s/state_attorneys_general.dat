5|$|In the United States, the {{legality}} of DFS has been determined on a state-by-state basis based on local gambling laws and other rulings. The federal Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIEGA) contains language dictating that fantasy sports are not considered an unlawful wager under the act; however, the act only prohibits the electronic transfer of funds from unlawful gambling as defined under state laws. A number of <b>state</b> <b>attorneys</b> <b>general</b> have issued opinions concluding that DFS {{is a form of}} illegal gambling, while the state of Nevada declared that DFS games must be licensed as a sports pool. The New York State ruling, which resulted from an investigation of DFS services after it was alleged that employees working for DraftKings and FanDuel had used inside information to win cash prizes from each other, spawned retaliatory lawsuits from the companies which alleged that the rulings were the result of a misinterpretation of the nature of their services. The state has since joined other states, such as Massachusetts and Virginia, in choosing to legalize and regulate DFS rather than prohibit it.|$|E

25|$|As Attorney General, Spitzer {{stepped up}} {{the profile of}} the office. Traditionally, <b>state</b> <b>attorneys</b> <b>general</b> have pursued {{consumer}} rights cases, concentrating on local fraud while deferring national issues to the federal government. Breaking with this traditional deference, Spitzer took up civil actions and criminal prosecutions relating to corporate white-collar crime, securities fraud, Internet fraud, and environmental protection. The New York Attorney General's office has Wall Street (and thus many leading corporate and financial institutions) within its jurisdiction. Also, the New York Attorney General wields greater than usual powers of investigation and prosecution of corporations under New York State's General Business Law. In particular, under the Martin Act of 1921, the New York Attorney General has the power to subpoena witnesses and company documents pertaining to investigations of fraud or illegal activity by a corporation. Spitzer used this statute to allow his office to prosecute cases which have been described as within federal jurisdiction. Spitzer used this authority in his civil actions against corporations and criminal prosecutions against their officers. It proved useful in the wake of several U.S. corporate scandals that began with the collapse of Enron in 2001. Several of these corporations, as well as the brokerage houses that sold their stock, were accused of having inflated stock values by unethical means throughout the 1990s. When inquiries into these allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Congress failed, Spitzer's office used its subpoena power to obtain corporate documents, building cases against the firms both in courtrooms and in public opinion.|$|E

500|$|In April 2012, the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) and 33 U.S. states {{brought a}} civil {{antitrust}} action against Apple, HarperCollins, Macmillan Publishers, Penguin Books, Simon & Schuster, and Hachette Book Group, Inc., alleging {{violations of the}} Sherman Act. The suit was filed in the Southern District of New York and alleges the defendants conspired to restrain retail price competition {{in the sale of}} e-books because they viewed Amazon's price discounting as a substantial challenge to their traditional business model. Regarding Apple in particular, the federal complaint alleged that [...] "Apple facilitated the Publisher Defendants' collective effort to end retail price competition by coordinating their transition to an agency model across all retailers. Apple clearly understood that its participation in this scheme would result in higher prices to consumers." [...] In such an agency-model, publishers set prices rather than sellers. Fifteen states and Puerto Rico also filed a companion federal case in Austin, Texas, against Apple, Penguin, Simon & Schuster and Macmillan. In the same month, HarperCollins, Hachette and Simon & Schuster settled with both the DOJ and the <b>state</b> <b>attorneys</b> <b>general,</b> with HarperCollins and Hachette agreeing to pay Texas and Connecticut $52 million in consumer restitution, leaving Apple, Penguin, and Macmillan as remaining defendants. As of July 2012, the case was still in the discovery stage of litigation. On July 10, 2013, District Court Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan found Apple Inc. guilty of the violation of federal antitrust law, citing [...] "compelling evidence" [...] that Apple played a [...] "central role" [...] in a conspiracy with publishers to eliminate retail competition and the prices of e-books.|$|E
