25|$|For Ge'ez, Amharic, Tigrinya and Tigre, {{the usual}} <b>sort</b> <b>order</b> is called halehame (h–l–ħ–m).

In Tigrinya, for example, the letters based on ከ come in this order: ከ, ኰ, ኸ, ዀ. In Blin, the sorting order is slightly different.|$|E
25|$|Stable sort {{algorithms}} sort identical {{elements in}} the same order that they appear in the input. When sorting some kinds of data, only part of the data is examined when determining the <b>sort</b> <b>order.</b> For example, in the card sorting example to the right, the cards are being sorted by their rank, and their suit is being ignored. This allows the possibility of multiple different correctly sorted versions of the original list. Stable sorting algorithms choose one of these, according to the following rule: if two items compare as equal, like the two 5 cards, then their relative order will be preserved, so that if one came before the other in the input, it will also come before the other in the output.|$|E

40|$|Grouping batch and <b>sorting</b> <b>order</b> (GBSO) for {{smelting}} charges {{is a key}} {{cycle in}} refined copper strip producing. To improve its scientific degree, optimization problem of GBSO for smelting charges in refined copper strip producing by artificial immune algorithm (AIA) is studied. The multi-objective optimization model for GBSO of smelting charges is established with the objectives which includes minimizing fluctuation in ingredient ratios between the nearest neighbor charges, meeting order priority requirement as much as possible, insuring order due date as much as possible, maximizing number of same brand charges and <b>sorting</b> <b>order</b> in continuous way for same order as much as possible. Some constraints are adequately considered, which includes order due data of each charge, <b>sorting</b> <b>order</b> limit for the charge with high quality requirement, <b>sorting</b> <b>order</b> limit for the charge with the high ratio of virtual <b>orders,</b> <b>sorting</b> <b>order</b> limit for the charge including multi-order, <b>sorting</b> <b>order</b> continuously for same brand charges, ingredient ratio limit for the charge which is <b>sorted</b> <b>order</b> as the first charge, ingredient ratio difference limit between each two nearest neighbor charges. To solve the model in easy way, some constraints are transformed into the objective function, and AIA is designed. The detail steps of AIA is designed in detail including antibody representation and encoding, affinity calculation, clone selection, antibody population updating. To validate the validity of above model and AIA, select practical typical GBSO problem of smelting charges as application instance. Application result shows that, the obtained optimal solution is better than that by heuristic method both on diversity and optimization degree. AIA is suitable for solving complex problem with requirement on solution diversity.  IEEE Beijing Section; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of Texas at Dallas (UTD); Osaka Universit...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Many {{database}} applications require sorting a table (or relation) over multiple <b>sort</b> <b>orders.</b> Some {{examples include}} creation of multiple indices on a relation, generation of multiple reports from a table, {{evaluation of a}} complex query that involves multiple instances of a relation, and batch processing {{of a set of}} queries. In this paper, we study how to optimize multiple sortings of a table. We investigate the correlation between <b>sort</b> <b>orders</b> and exploit <b>sort</b> sharing techniques of reusing the (partial) work done to sort a table on a particular order for another order. Specifically, we introduce a novel and powerful evaluation technique, called cooperative sorting, that enables sort sharing between seemingly non-related <b>sort</b> <b>orders.</b> Subsequently, given a specific set of <b>sort</b> <b>orders,</b> we determine the best combination of various sort sharing techniques so as to minimize the total processing cost.
