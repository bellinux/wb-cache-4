50|$|Tobacco-induced {{lung cancer}} {{research}} has found TCF21 {{to be among the}} genes identified as highly methylated at both high and low concentrations of cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate</b> (CSC). In the presence genistein, one of the soy-derived bioactive isoflavones, methylation of TCF21 is significantly reduced. Genistein has been known to affect tumorigenesis through epigenetic regulation, such as chromatin configuration and DNA methylation, activating other tumor suppressor genes that affect cancer cell survival. These findings support the hypothesis that increasing hypermethylated tumor suppressor genes such as TCF21 is a potential chemopreventative pathway in tobacco-induced lung cancer.|$|E
50|$|Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy is {{the disease}} in humans that is most {{frequently}} associated with homoplasmy. This condition {{is characterized by the}} atrophy of retinal ganglion cells, which leads to central blindness and eventually total blindness. Although it is passed down maternally, it is seen more often in young men than in other ages or sexes, which leads researchers to believe that there are many other genetic or environmental factors that contribute to developing the disease. Specifically, researchers have thought that the genetic component outside of the mitochondria would be on the X chromosome; however, in multiple studies, there have been no findings that suggest this. Environmental factors, cigarette smoke in particular, have been shown to affect LHON's penetrance. In one study, cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate</b> was used to demonstrate the effects of smoking on cells with the LHON mutation. All cells were homoplasmic, but some were from individuals who were afflicted with LHON and some were from individuals who were just carriers. The researchers found that cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate</b> lowered the amount of mitochondria in the cells, but that carrier individuals were better able to compensate than those from individuals with LHON. Though there is an additive environmental effect, there is more to learn about why certain homoplasmic individuals have the disease and others do not.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Increased {{epithelial}} permeability of the airspaces occurs commonly in {{the lungs}} of cigarette smokers. It {{is likely to be}} important in augmenting the inflammatory response in the airspaces and hence may have a role in the pathogenesis of emphysema. It has previously been shown that intratracheal instillation of cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate</b> induces increased epithelial permeability in vivo in rats and in vitro in epithelial cell monolayers, associated with a disturbance in the lung antioxidant, glutathione (GSH). The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the role of neutrophils, GSH, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in the increased epithelial permeability following intratracheal instillation of cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate.</b> METHODS: Epithelial permeability of the airspaces was measured in rat lungs as the passage of intratracheally instilled 125 -iodine labelled bovine serum albumin (BSA) into the blood. The permeability of a monolayer of human type II alveolar epithelial cells to 125 I-BSA was also measured. RESULTS: Cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate</b> produced a 59. 7 % increase in epithelial permeability over control values peaking six hours after instillation and returning to control values by 24 hours. Depletion of neutrophils and, to a lesser extent, macrophages by an intraperitoneal injection of antineutrophil antibody did not influence the increased epithelial permeability induced by cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate.</b> Although instillation of human recombinant TNF alpha produced an increase in epithelial permeability in the rat lung from 0. 62 (0. 61) % to 1. 27 (0. 08) %, only a trivial amount of TNF alpha was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in vivo or in culture medium from BAL leucocytes obtained from animals treated with cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate</b> (94. 9 (28. 8) units/ml). Furthermore, antiTNF antibody did not abolish the increased epithelial permeability produced by cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate.</b> The role of GSH was assessed by measuring the changes in both the reduced (GSH) and oxidised form (GSSG) in lung tissue and in BAL fluid. One hour after instillation of cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate</b> there was a marked fall in the GSH content in the lung (from 809. 8 (31. 8) to 501. 7 (40. 5) nmol/g) in association with increased GSSG levels (from 89. 8 (2. 7) to 148. 7 (48. 8) nmol/g). This was followed by a return of GSH levels to control values, with a concomitant decrease in GSSG levels six hours after instillation. GSH levels in BAL fluid fell dramatically following cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate</b> (from 2. 56 (0. 30) to 0. 31 (0. 21) nmol/ml) and this fall was sustained up to six hours after instillation of cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate.</b> CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that neutrophils and TNF do not have a major role in the increased epithelial permeability induced by cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate.</b> However, the data support a role for the depletion of the antioxidant glutathione in the increased epithelial permeability caused by cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate...</b>|$|E

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIBackground and Objective:  Tobacco {{smoking is}} a {{significant}} risk factor for periodontal disease. It {{has been suggested that}} smoking may alter connective tissue remodeling in the periodontium. In the present study, we investigated whether cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate</b> modulates the production of the serine protease urokinase in human gingival fibroblasts. Material and Methods:  Primary cultures of human gingival fibroblasts were stimulated with cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate.</b> Urokinase production was evaluated through casein zymography and western blotting. Plasmin activation was assessed by means of a radial diffusion assay. The roles of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and reactive oxygen species in cigarette smoke condensate-stimulated urokinase production were studied using distinct selective inhibitors (SP 600125, PD 98059, N-acetyl cysteine). Reactive oxygen species production was determined using a fluorometric assay. Activation of ERK and JNK pathways were evaluated using western blots. Results:  In gingival fibroblasts, cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate</b> potently stimulated urokinase production and plasmin activation. Cigarette smoke condensate-stimulated urokinase production was dependent on the activity of ERK/JNK pathways and was inhibited by the reactive oxygen species scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine. Cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate</b> strongly stimulated ERK and JNK phosphorylation and the generation of reactive oxygen species. Conclusion:  Cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate</b> stimulates urokinase production and plasmin activation in gingival fibroblasts. Moreover, cigarette smoke condensate-stimulated urokinase production depends on both the activation of ERK/JNK pathways and on the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. These results show that cigarette smoke may alter connective tissue remodeling by inducing production of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator through specific signaling pathways.

BackgroundCigarette smoking {{increases the risk of}} progression of diabetic and non-diabetic renal diseases. The mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of smoking are largely unknown. We examined the subtotally nephrectomized rat (i) to investigate whether components of cigarette smoke dissolved in acetone (cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate)</b> aggravate structural renal damage and (ii) to establish whether this provides an animal model {{that can be used to}} investigate potential pathomechanisms of cigarette smoke-induced renal damage. Since nicotine activates the sympathetic nerve system in humans, we investigated whether interference with this system modulates the effects of cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate</b> on the damaged kidney. MethodsOne group of Sprague-Dawley rats was subtotally nephrectomized (SNX). Acetone (SNX + solvent) or cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate</b> (SNX + cigarette) was applied daily to the oral mucosa. Another group of Sprague-Dawley rats was sham-operated and received the same treatments (sham + solvent, sham + cigarette). To investigate whether increased activity of the sympathetic nerve system is involved, the remnant kidney was denervated by microsurgical technique in one SNX + cigarette group. The control group for this intervention was a solvent-treated SNX group with denervated remnant kidney. Blood pressure (BP) was measured weekly by tail plethysmography. The experiment was terminated after 12 weeks. Structural renal damage was assessed by morphometric techniques (indices of glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial and vascular damage) and urinary albumin and endothelin- 1 excretion were measured. ResultsIndices of structural renal damage were increased in all SNX-groups. Treatment with cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate</b> further increased the indices of glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial damage in SNX, but not sham-operated rats. This increase was completely prevented by renal denervation. No differences in systemic blood pressure were observed in the different SNX groups. Urinary albumin excretion went in parallel with the indices of glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial damage and urinary endothelin- 1 excretion was significantly increased in SNX + cigarette animals. ConclusionThese findings document that acetone soluble components in cigarette smoke aggravate glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial damage in the renal ablation model. Renal injury induced by cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>condensate</b> in this model is reversed by renal denervation. We conclude that cigarette smoke-induced renal damage is due, at least in part, to activation of the sympathetic nerve system...|$|E

40|$|IT {{has been}} known for some years that when {{cigarette}} smoke is condenlsed and the condensate subsequently dried and stored it forms a " tar "-like substance which when painted on the backs of certain strains of mice gives rise to epithelial tumours (literature reviewed by Wynder and Hoffmann, 1964).

We evaluated a role of p 53 on genotoxic effect and apoptosis in lung cancer cells exposed to marijuana <b>smoke</b> <b>condensates</b> (MSCs). Methods: The p 53 -related genotoxicity and apoptosis of MSCs were evaluated using in vitro bioassay, viz., comet assay, cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay and apoptosis assay. We used two cell lines with differential p 53 expression (p 53 -wildtype (WT) H 460 and p 53 -null H 1299). Results: MSCs significantly increased DNA breakages and chromosomal changes in p 53 -WT H 460 and p 53 -null H 1299 cells. The genotoxicity induced by MSCs in p 53 -null H 1299 cells showed greater sensitivity than p 53 -WT H 460 cells. Moreover, MSCs showed a significant increase in reactive oxygen species production and apoptosis. The apoptotic responses induced by MSCs were higher in p 53 -WT H 460 cells than in p 53 -null H 1299 cells. Significantly increased mRNA expression or apoptosis related genes, including p 53, caspase- 3, and Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio were observed in the p 53 -WT H 460 cells exposed to MSCs.

The mice were treated with half of each dose (5, 10 or 15 mg) twice a week, for only 3 months. No substance was used as promoter or as an additional initator of carcogenicity. No statistically {{significant difference was found}} when the life span of MS-treated and untreated animals were compared. In contrast the life span of SS-treated mice were significantly (P< 0. 01) shorter than those of MS-treated animals or those of all three negative control groups together. The observed carcin ogenic effects were based on tumours and lesions found only on the site of application of the test material. Of 210 mice (effected number, 129) serving as the negative controls, 3 developed skin lesions but no tumours. Of 210 MS-treated mice (effective number, 177), 7 developed tumours (4 malignant and 3 benign) and 35 had a uniform type of precancerous skin lesion. The initiation of these latter lesions was found to be dose-dependent (P< 0. 001). The SS-treated animals developed two to six times more skin tumours than the MS-treated mice. Comparing the negative controls with the MS- or SS-treated animals, the overall carcinogenic effect observed was statistically significant. Comparing the MS- with the SS-treated animals, the overall carcinogenic effect of SS was much higher than that of MS (P< 0. 001) ...|$|R
