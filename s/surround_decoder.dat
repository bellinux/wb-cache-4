50|$|The 5.1 {{surround}} sound is encoded in the stereo wave for transmission {{and is thus}} compatible with any mono/stereo/matrix-style receiver. If played on a 5.1 audio set equipped with Neural <b>Surround</b> <b>decoder,</b> the watermarks (i.e. spatial cues) in the waveforms are detected and the signal is recovered to its original 5.1 form. The technology is similar to parametric stereo, in which a mono signal is recovered to stereo. The bitrate for XMHD surround broadcasts is ~70 kbit/s using aacPlus from Coding Technologies.|$|E
5000|$|The Sound Retrieval System (SRS) is a {{patented}} psychoacoustic 3D audio processing technology originally {{invented by}} Arnold Klayman {{in the early}} 1980s. (The original SRS patents are , [...] and , which expired between 2006 and 2008. Patents may apply in other countries). The SRS technology applies head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to create an immersive 3D soundfield using only two speakers, widening the [...] "sweet spot," [...] creating a more spacious sense of ambience, and producing strong localization cues for discrete instruments within an audio mix. SRS is not a Dolby matrix <b>surround</b> <b>decoder</b> but works with normal stereo recordings.|$|E
5000|$|The Yamaha DSP-1 is a {{processor}} of early home theater surround sound equipment, produced in 1985. The DSP-1 (referred to by Yamaha as a Digital Soundfield Processor) allowed owners to synthesize up to 6-channels of surround sound from 2 channel stereo sound via a complex {{digital signal processor}} (DSP). Much like today's home theater receivers the DSP-1 offered sixteen [...] "sound fields" [...] created through the DSP including a jazz club, a cathedral, a concert hall, and a stadium. However, unlike today's integrated amps and receivers, these soundfield modes were highly editable, allowing the owner to customize the effect {{to his or her}} own personal taste. The DSP-1 also included an analog Dolby <b>Surround</b> <b>decoder</b> as well as other effects such as real-time echo and pitch change.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{several key}} improvements {{that can be}} made to current <b>surround</b> sound <b>decoder</b> design techniques. The work focuses on the use of heuristic methods to derive <b>surround</b> sound <b>decoder</b> parameters for irregular loudspeaker layouts. A comparison is made between decoder parameters derived from the new improved algorithm and parameters published by others. The results show that the new parameters derived using this algorithm are superior to other parameters and the new range removal technique introduced in this paper warrants further investigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} {{surround}} audio formats is examined, {{and a low}} cost solution to multi-channel encoding is explored and developed, taking DSP techniques into consideration. The algorithm developed will process four channels of audio and encode them so that a Dolby <b>Surround</b> <b>decoder</b> (or a Dolby ProLogic decoder) will successfully decode the signals when used {{as part of a}} home theatre / home entertainment system. The algorithm is a low cost alternative to the Dolby Encoding System. 1...|$|E
40|$|Dolby Surround {{technology}} offers consumers surround sound {{in their home}} via a 4 : 2 : 4 encode/decode matrix. Although originally intended for audio accompanying visual media, the system has potential as a music-only playback system. The purpose of the thesis is to investigate this potential, particularly {{as it applies to}} acoustic music recording. Dolby Surround encode and decode technology and its relevance to acoustic music reproduction is reviewed. The classic stereo microphone techniques are discussed with particular attention paid to each one's theoretical ability to "encode" information for the Dolby <b>Surround</b> <b>decoder.</b> Practical limitations and benefits of these well-known methods are considered. Recently proposed microphone techniques are reviewed in theory and in practice and are found to provide many solutions. Methods for optimizing the decoder technology for music reproduction are suggested. The paper is relevant to any acoustic recording application for a number of surround systems as well as for conventional stereo and mono...|$|E
50|$|Although Dolby Surround was {{introduced}} as an analog format, all Dolby Digital decoders incorporate a digitally implemented Dolby <b>Surround</b> Pro Logic <b>decoder</b> for digital stereo signals that carry matrix-encoded Dolby Surround. One {{of the first}} was the MSP400 surround sound receiver and amplifier by RCA for their high-end Dimensia brand. It was released in 1987 for the Digital Command Component System.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "home {{theater in}} a box" [...] (HTIB) is an {{integrated}} home theater package which [...] "bundles" [...] together a combination DVD or Blu-ray player, a multi-channel amplifier (which includes a <b>surround</b> sound <b>decoder,</b> a radio tuner, and other features), speaker wires, connection cables, a remote control, {{a set of}} five or more surround sound speakers (or more rarely, just left and right speakers, a lower-price option known as [...] "2.1") and a low-frequency subwoofer cabinet.In 2016,They are manufactured by most makers of consumer electronics. Budget HTIB's with generic or lower-price [...] "house" [...] brands (e.g., Best Buy's Insignia line) may be a [...] "2.1" [...] system. Many, however, are a full [...] "5.1" [...] system and some higher-end packages even have a 7.1 system. Some popular manufacturers of HTIB's are RCA, Philips, Panasonic, Sony, Yamaha, LG and Samsung, all of which make a variety of mid-price range packages. Bose and Onkyo make higher-end, higher-priced HTIB packages.|$|R
40|$|All {{previously}} published Ambisonic decoders for irregular loudspeaker layouts have localisation performance which varies significantly by angle around the listener. This contrasts with decoders designed for evenly spaced arrangements of loudspeakers where performance characteristics are isotropic. Furthermore even localisation performance around the listener is desirable {{for a number}} of application areas of 5. 1 <b>surround</b> sound. New <b>decoder</b> design criteria are presented which aim to reduce this variation in localisation performance. These criteria are added to a multiobjective fitness function, based on auditory localisation theory, which guides a heuristic search algorithm to derive decoder parameter sets for the ITU 5. 1 layout. The derived decoders exhibit a significant improvement in localisation performance variation by angle around the 360 º sound stage...|$|R
40|$|This projectâs {{specifically}} purposed as a demo application, so {{anyone can}} get {{the experience of a}} surround audio room without having to physically involved to it, with a main idea of generating a 3 D surround sound room scenery coupled with surround sound in a handier package, namely, a âVirtual Listen Roomâ. Virtual Listen Room set a foundation of an innovative visualization that later will be developed and released as one of way of portable advertisement. This application was built inside of Android environment. Android device had been chosen as the implementation target, since it leaves massive development spaces and mostly contains essential components needed on this project, including graphic processor unit (GPU). Graphic manipulation can be done using an embedded programming interface called OpenGL ES, which is planted in all Android devices generally. Further, Android has a Accelerometer Sensor that is needed to be coupled with scene to produce a dynamic movement of the camera. Surround sound effect can be reached with a decoder from Phillips called MPEG <b>Surround</b> Sound <b>Decoder.</b> To sum the whole project, we got an application with sensor-dynamic 3 D room visualization coupled with Philipsâ Surround Sound Music Player. We can manipulate several roomâs properties; Subwoofer location, Room light, and how many speakers inside it, the application itself works well despite facing several performance problems before, later to be solved...|$|R

50|$|The {{information}} is then passed to an amplitude matrix that develops the speaker feeds, via {{a set of}} shelf filters, which improve the accuracy and performance of the decoder in smaller listening environments (they can be omitted in larger-scale applications). Ambisonics was designed to suit actual living rooms and practical speaker positions: most living rooms are rectangular {{and as a result}} the basic system was designed to decode to four loudspeakers in a rectangle, with sides between 1:2 (width twice the length) and 2:1 (length twice the width) in length, thus suiting the majority of living rooms. A layout control is generally provided to allow the decoder to be configured for the loudspeaker positions - an important aspect of Ambisonic replay where it differs from other <b>surround</b> systems: the <b>decoder</b> is specifically configured for the size and layout of the speaker array. The layout control may {{take the form of a}} rotary knob, a 2-way (1:2,2:1) or a 3-way (1:2,1:1,2:1) switch.|$|R
