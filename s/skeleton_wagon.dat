60|$|He {{leaned forward}} with his {{expression}} of humorous enjoyment of some latent joke and did {{something with the}} reins--Rose never could clearly understand what, though {{it seemed to her}} that he simply lifted them with ostentatious lightness; but the mare suddenly seemed to LENGTHEN herself and lose her height, and the stalks of wheat on either side of the dusty track began to melt into each other, and then slipped like a flash into one long, continuous, shimmering green hedge. So perfect was the mare's action that the girl was scarcely conscious of any increased effort; so harmonious the whole movement that the light <b>skeleton</b> <b>wagon</b> seemed only a prolonged process of that long, slim body and free, collarless neck, both straight as the thin shafts on each side and straighter than the delicate ribbon-like traces which, in what seemed a mere affectation of conscious power, hung at times almost limp between the whiffle-tree and the narrow breast band which was all that confined the animal's powerful fore-quarters. So superb was the reach of its long easy stride that Rose could scarcely see any undulations in the brown shining back on which she could have placed her foot, nor felt the soft beat of the delicate hoofs that took the dust so firmly and yet so lightly.|$|E
5000|$|Hambletonian 10, {{from his}} Standard {{registered}} number, {{made his first}} public appearance {{at the age of}} six months at the nearby Orange County Fair in Goshen. He caused quite a sensation and horsemen started referring to him as [...] "Rysdyk's Abdallah colt." [...] Meanwhile another son of Abdallah, Abdallah Chief, owned by Seeley C. Roe, was looming as a competitor for the local stallion honors. Roe had nothing but contempt for Hambletonian, and claimed he'd never be a trotter, only a show horse. This issue was settled in 1852 at Long Island's Union Course. Hambletonian and Abdallah Chief were hitched to <b>skeleton</b> <b>wagons</b> with their owners driving. Three minutes and three seconds after the start, Hambletonian crossed the finish line ahead of his rival. Roe still wasn't satisfied and insisted on another race. A time trial was held. Abdallah Chief went the mile in 2:55½. Then Roe watched Hambletonian, in what would be the only time trial of his career, trot the mile in 2:48½.|$|R

5000|$|The {{painting}} shows a {{panorama of}} an army of skeletons wreaking havoc across a blackened, desolate landscape. Fires burn in the distance, and the sea is littered with shipwrecks. A few leafless trees stud hills otherwise bare of vegetation; fish lie rotting {{on the shores of}} a corpse-choked pond. Art historian James Snyder emphasizes the [...] "scorched, barren earth, devoid of any life {{as far as the eye}} can see." [...] In this setting, legions of skeletons advance on the living, who either flee in terror or try in vain to fight back. In the foreground, <b>skeletons</b> haul a <b>wagon</b> full of skulls; in the upper left corner, others ring the bell that signifies the death knell of the world. A fool plays the lute while a lady sings; behind both of them a skeleton plays along; a starving dog nibbles at the face of a child; a cross sits in the center of the painting. People are herded into a coffin shaped trap decorated with crosses, while a skeleton on horseback kills people with a scythe. The painting depicts people of different social backgrounds - from peasants and soldiers to nobles as well as a king and a cardinal - being taken by death indiscriminately.|$|R
