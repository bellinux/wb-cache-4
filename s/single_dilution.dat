50|$|<b>Single</b> <b>dilution</b> method {{requires}} {{the knowledge of}} the isotopic composition of the isotopically-enriched analyte (RB) and the amount of the enriched analyte added (nB). Both of these variables are hard to establish since isotopically-enriched substances are generally available in small quantities of questionable purity. As a result, before isotope dilution is performed on the sample, the amount of the enriched analyte is ascertained beforehand using isotope dilution. This preparatory step is called the reverse isotope dilution and it involves a standard of natural isotopic-composition analyte (denoted as A*). First proposed in the 1940s and further developed in the 1950s, reverse isotope dilution remains an effective means of characterizing a labeled material.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSerial {{dilution}} and <b>single</b> <b>dilution</b> enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were standardised {{and their}} {{sensitivity and specificity}} were compared for serodiagnosis of Babesia equi infection. The antibody titres of 24 donkey sera of known identity were determined separately by serial dilution ELISA using three different B. equi antigens namely whole merozoite (WM), cell membrane (CM) and high speed supernatant (HSS). The ratios of the optical density (OD) of known positive and known negative sera at different serum dilutions were calculated and termed as the positive/negative (P/N) ratio. The coefficients of correlation (r) were calculated between the P/N ratios at different dilutions of sera and the log$_{ 10 }$ antibody titres of the same sera were ascertained by serial dilution ELISA. The highest value of 'r' was obtained at a serum dilution of 1 : 200. From log$_{ 10 }$ antibody titre of sera (y) and their P/N ratio at a dilution of 1 : 200 (x), regression equations (y = a + bx) were calculated separately for the three antigens. Test sera were diluted to 1 : 200, their OD were read in duplicate wells and were converted to the P/N ratio. Antibody titres were predicted from the P/N ratio using a regression equation separately for the three antigens. Titres obtained by both ELISAs {{were not significantly different}} from each other, thus confirming that <b>single</b> <b>dilution</b> ELISA could be successfully used to replace conventional serial dilution ELISA. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of <b>single</b> <b>dilution</b> ELISA was validated statistically using 42 B. equi disease-positive sera and 106 B. equi disease-negative sera. The WM antigen was found to be the most sensitive with a higher predictive value for negative test sera as compared to the CM or HSS antigens. Sera positive for other equine infections including Babesia caballi showed no cross-reaction with the three B. equi antigens in ELISA, thus the test was immunologically specific. Antibody titres of 109 unknown field donkey/horse sera obtained by serial and <b>single</b> <b>dilution</b> ELISA using the WM antigen did not show any significant difference.
