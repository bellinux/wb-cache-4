50|$|Up {{until the}} mid-1980s, {{commercial}} sidescan images were produced on paper records. The early paper records were produced with a sweeping plotter that burned the image into a scrolling paper record. Later plotters {{allowed for the}} simultaneous plotting of position and ship motion information onto the paper record. In the late 1980s, commercial systems using the newer, cheaper computer systems developed digital scan-converters that could mimic more cheaply the analog <b>scan</b> <b>converters</b> used by the military systems to produce TV and computer displayed images of the scan, and store them on video tape. Currently data is stored on computer hard drives or solid-state media.|$|R

The operation and basic performance of the transistor <b>scanned</b> <b>converter</b> are discussed and its resolution and sensitivity investigated, resulting in an apparent practical limit to the resolution in. the image plane of ⅓ mm, and an estimated limiting sensitivity of approximately 10 - 13 W cm- 2. Possible methods for the fabrication of a multielement converter are suggested and discussed. Three signal processing techniques are investigated and compared;;that using an acoustic lens in a conventional camera arrangement, an on-line computer which effectively performs electrically the function of a lens, and a scanned array Doppler system on which only a feasibility study was carried out. It is argued that if flexibility is important then the computer "lens" is the most fitting method, and results for both near field focusing and far field beam deflection are presented) although at the moment. in 1 -dimension only, A relatively simple extension to the program will make 2 -dimensional image reconstruction possible [...] The Doppler system described provides a simple electrical method of determining the range and bearing of far field targets and results adequately confirm the developed theory...|$|R

A first series of parallel transparent conductive stripes is on the insulating layer with a processing circuit connected {{to each of the}} conductive stripes for detecting the modulated voltages generated thereon. In a first embodiment of the invention, a modulated light stripe perpendicular to the conductive stripes <b>scans</b> the image <b>converter.</b> In a second embodiment a second insulating layer is deposited over the conductive stripes and a second series of parallel transparent conductive stripes perpendicular to the first series is on the second insulating layer.

50|$|This {{conversion}} is done using {{large numbers}} of delay cells and is appropriate for analog video. It may also be performed using a specialized <b>scan</b> <b>converter</b> vacuum tube. In this case polar coordinates (angle and distance) data from a source such as a radar receiver, {{so that it can}} be displayed on a raster scan (TV type) display.|$|E
50|$|Since the camera's {{scan rate}} was {{much lower than}} the {{approximately}} 30 fps for NTSC video, the television standard used in North America at the time, a real-time scan conversion was needed to be able to show its images on a regular TV set. NASA selected a <b>scan</b> <b>converter</b> manufactured by RCA to convert the black-and-white SSTV signals from the Apollo 7, 8, 9 and 11 missions.|$|E
50|$|The {{function}} of the Raster Memory board is to perform rasterization. It also contains the texture memory and raster memory, which is more {{commonly known as the}} framebuffer. Rasterization is performed in the Fragment Generator and the eighty Image Engines. The Fragment Generator comprises four ASIC designs: the <b>Scan</b> <b>Converter</b> (SC) ASIC, the Texel Address Calculator (TA) ASIC, the Texture Memory Controller (TM) ASIC and the Texture Fragment (TF) ASIC.|$|E
50|$|When the Apollo TV camera radioed its images, {{the ground}} {{stations}} received its raw unconverted SSTV signal and split it into two branches. One signal branch was sent unprocessed to a fourteen-track analog data tape recorder {{where it was}} recorded onto fourteen-inch diameter reels of one-inch-wide analog magnetic data tapes at 120 inches per second. The other raw SSTV signal branch {{was sent to the}} RCA <b>scan</b> <b>converter</b> where it would be processed into an NTSC broadcast television signal.|$|E
50|$|Various VGA {{accessories}} and independent hacks were produced for these consoles, mostly by third-party manufacturers and hobbyists. However, since {{none of these}} consoles were capable of producing a native RGBHV signal at 31 kHz for standard VGA output, these devices were generally designed around an outboard color space transcoder and/or <b>scan</b> <b>converter.</b> The most common and inexpensive of these devices, as with most similarly low-end general purpose signal converters, generated a VGA signal from composite or S-Video, resulting in poor quality.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process in}} {{practice}} is applicable only using integrated circuits in LSI and VLSI scales. Timing, interference between digital and analog signals, clocks, noise and exact synchronization have {{important roles in}} the circuit.Digital conversion method needs the analog video signal to be converted to digital data at the first step.A <b>scan</b> <b>converter</b> {{can be made in}} its basic structure using some high speed integrated circuits as a circuit board however there are some integrated circuits which perform this function plus other picture processing functions like scissoring, change of aspect ratio and … an easy to use example was SDA9401 ...|$|E
5000|$|Computer video signals: Computer video {{can be set}} up to run at many {{different}} frame or field rates, ranging 50 frame/s to more than 240 frame/s. Computer video is generally progressive by default, but many interlaced modes exist. A <b>scan</b> <b>converter</b> is typically needed to convert these signals to one of the many acceptable broadcast standards, such as 59.97 Hz or 50 Hz. This type of conversion typically degrades the quality of the broadcast image, usually resulting with either [...] "motion artifacts" [...] or a lower resolution. It is recommended that the display rate be set to equal the target television rate if possible.|$|E
50|$|The {{problem with}} flying-spot {{scanners}} {{was the difference}} in frequencies between television field rates and film frame rates. This was solved first by the Mk. I Polygonal Prism system, which was optically synchronised to the television frame rate by the rotating prism and could be run at any frame rate. This {{was replaced by the}} Mk. II Twin Lens, and then around 1975, by the Mk. III Hopping Patch (jump scan). The Mk. III series progressed from the original “jump scan” interlace scan to the Mk. IIIB which used a progressive scan and included a digital <b>scan</b> <b>converter</b> (Digiscan) to output interlaced video. The Mk. IIIC was the most popular of the series and used a next generation Digiscan plus other improvements.|$|E
50|$|The RCA <b>scan</b> <b>converter</b> {{operated}} on an optical conversion principle. The conversion process started when the signal {{was sent to}} a high-quality 10-inch video monitor where a conventional RCA TK-22 television camera—using the NTSC broadcast standard of 525 scanned lines interlaced at 30 fps—merely re-photographed its screen. The monitor had persistent phosphors, that acted as a primitive framebuffer. An analog disk recorder, based on the Ampex HS-100 model, was used to record the first field from the camera. It then fed that field, and an appropriately time-delayed copy of the first field, to the NTSC Field Interlace Switch (encoder). The combined original and copied fields created the first full 525-line interlaced frame and the signal was then sent to Houston. The disk recorder repeated this sequence five more times, until the camera imaged the next SSTV frame. The converter then repeated the whole process with each new frame downloaded from space in real-time. In this way, the RCA converter produced the extra 20 frames per second needed to produce flicker-free images to the world's television broadcasters.|$|E
50|$|This live {{conversion}} was crude {{compared to}} early-21st century electronic digital conversion techniques. Image degradation was unavoidable with this system as the monitor and camera's optical limitations significantly lowered the original SSTV signal's contrast, brightness and resolution. If the scan converter's settings were incorrectly set, {{as they were}} at the Goldstone station during the first few minutes of Apollo 11's moonwalk, the negative impact on the image could be very obvious. When Armstrong first came down the Lunar Module's ladder, he was barely visible because the contrast and the vertical phase were not set correctly by the <b>scan</b> <b>converter</b> operator. The video seen on home television sets was further degraded by the very long and noisy analog transmission path. The converted signal was sent by satellite from the three receiving ground stations to Houston, Texas. Then the network pool feed was sent by microwave relay to New York, where it was broadcast live to the United States and the world. Because all of these links were analog, each one added additional noise and distortion to the signal.|$|E
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the GeForce 8 series, which was produced by Nvidia, and then new generic stream processing unit GPUs became a more generalized computing device. Today, parallel GPUs have begun making computational inroads against the CPU, and a subfield of research, dubbed GPU Computing or GPGPU for General Purpose Computing on GPU, has found its way into fields as diverse as machine learning, oil exploration, scientific image processing, linear algebra, statistics, 3D reconstruction and even stock options pricing determination. GPGPU at the time was the precursor to what we now call compute shaders (e.g. CUDA, OpenCL, DirectCompute) and actually abused the hardware to a degree by treating the data passed to algorithms as texture maps and executing algorithms by drawing a triangle or quad with an appropriate pixel shader. This obviously entails some overheads since we involve units like the <b>Scan</b> <b>Converter</b> where they aren't really needed (nor do we even care about the triangles, except to invoke the pixel shader). Over the years, the energy consumption of GPUs has increased and to manage it, several techniques have been proposed.|$|E
50|$|From October 1, 1979 to July 1991, KOKH aired two-minute-long newsbriefs each hour, branded as Newstouch 25, from 6:00 a.m. until {{sign-off}} (usually around 1:30 a.m.); some {{morning and}} late night updates were pre-recorded. Among those who anchored the updates were Mike Monday, Karie Ross, Felicia Ferguson (who won the Miss Oklahoma pageant in 1985), Janis Walkingstick and Kelly Ogle (now evening anchor at KWTV). Until the late 1980s, the station also produced Weathertouch 25, two-minute-long weather updates that aired on the half-hour during the broadcast day; the segments (featuring weathercasters such as Ross Dixon, Dan Satterfield and Kevin Foreman) utilized the first colorized radar <b>scan</b> <b>converter</b> and satellite picture colorizer in Oklahoma, and used live radar {{data from the}} National Weather Service Terminal Doppler site at Will Rogers World Airport. The station also produced several public affairs and interview programs including Meet The Mayor (an interview program featuring discussions and viewer questions with the Mayor of Oklahoma City), Woman to Woman (which featured discussions about women's issues) and Sunday PM (a weekly talk show focusing on prominent people, issues and events in Oklahoma City).|$|E
50|$|The {{radar sensor}} is {{positioned}} {{on the earth}} surface with a height h above the ground. It measures the direct distance d to the target (and not e.g. the distance the target is away from the radar if one would move on the earth surface). This distance is then used in the display plane after adjustment to the current display zoom level by the radar <b>scan</b> <b>converter</b> (RSC).Now {{it has to be}} clarified how the radar video data is geo referenced. This basically means, that if we want to display a geographical real world object (like e.g. a light house) which is at the same real world position as the radar target, that it also shall appear at the same position in the display plane. This is realized by calculating the distance from the radar sensor to the respective real world object and use that distance in the display plane. The position of the real world object is typically given in geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude and height above the earth surface).In other words, using a radar projection with geographical data is done by simulating a radar measurement process with the real world objects and use the resulting range and azimuth in the display plane.|$|E
