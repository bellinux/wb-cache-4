5|$|On August 29, 2007, six AGM-129 ACM cruise missiles, each {{loaded with}} a W80-1 {{variable}} yield nuclear warhead, were mistakenly loaded onto a United States Air Force (USAF) B-52H heavy bomber at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and transported to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. The nuclear warheads in the missiles {{were supposed to}} have been removed before the missiles were taken from their <b>storage</b> <b>bunker.</b> The missiles with the nuclear warheads were not reported missing, and remained mounted to the aircraft at both Minot and Barksdale for 36 hours. During this period, the warheads were not protected by the various mandatory security precautions for nuclear weapons.|$|E
25|$|In the Oklahoma City area, the General Motors Oklahoma City Assembly {{sustained}} major damage as did as {{a manufacturing}} plant near Interstate 240 where F4 damage was observed. Several other businesses were either damaged or destroyed. At Tinker Air Force Base, a <b>storage</b> <b>bunker</b> and several fences were damaged. Several subdivisions in eastern Oklahoma City, Choctaw and Midwest City were also affected by the tornado with several homes sustaining significant damage.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, on the {{afternoon}} of 6 April, the South Vietnamese inside Lộc Ninh were slightly reinforced by the 3rd Battalion, ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment, along with the men of the 1st Cavalry Squadron at FSB Alpha who had refused to surrender. Furthermore, wounded South Vietnamese soldiers who were still able to fight made their way back to the defensive perimeter to await the next wave of attacks. During the night, the South Vietnamese compound descended into chaos when North Vietnamese artillery scored a direct hit on the hospital bunker, killing a large number of wounded men. Later on, another round of rockets struck the South Vietnamese artillery compound, striking [...] the ammunition <b>storage</b> <b>bunker,</b> which exploded. From {{the eastern side of the}} district, the Viet Cong tried to penetrate the defense line at Lộc Ninh, but were beaten off. Realizing that the situation had become hopeless, Vinh took off his uniform and told his to surrender.|$|E

50|$|Munitions <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> are {{designed}} to securely store explosive ordnance, and contain any internal explosions. The most common configuration for high explosives storage is the igloo shaped bunker. They are often built into a hillside {{in order to provide}} additional containment mass.|$|R
50|$|Today {{some of the}} Depot’s {{buildings}} remain, {{including the}} ammunition <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> and {{less than half of}} the PMQs. The camp chapel is now a Baptist church and Sergeants’ Mess was relocated off site, for use as the South Portage Recreation Center.|$|R
50|$|In late 2008 {{and early}} 2009 the {{remaining}} buildings were demolished over four months (the <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> pictured in this article).

50|$|Coal is {{delivered}} via a railroad by 100-car trains, each carrying 10,000 tons of coal. At the plant, an automated unloading trestle empties the train in about 30 minutes and conveyor belts move the coal to the storage pile or the <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> inside the plant. The bunkers hold a 14-hour reserve; the coal pile target inventory is a 32-day supply.|$|R
50|$|Decommissioned in 1992, all 58 cavern <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> and the {{extensive}} above ground network of storage sheds {{and other military}} buildings remain in place. Ownership of the site was transferred from the Ministry of Defence to Anglo-Irish consortium Omega Pacific in 1998, and then by court order to the Manhattan Loft Corporation in 2002. The site is being redeveloped as an industrial park.|$|R

50|$|Risley Royal Ordnance Factory (ROF) was {{a filling}} factory. It {{received}} the explosives in bulk, usually by rail, from other ROFs {{where they were}} manufactured. Risley specialised in filling them into the various casings to produce the finished munitions. There were 16 filling factories {{around the country and}} Risley was known as Filling Factory No. 6. Others in the north west included Chorley (No. 1) and Kirkby (No. 7). One of the features common to all of the filling factories was an area of <b>storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> where the finished munitions were stored awaiting dispatch. The areas within the filling factories were all numbered in the same way. <b>Storage</b> <b>bunkers</b> were designated Area 9. Risley had 20 such bunkers and Area 9 is roughly {{in the area of the}} main field in Birchwood Forest Park today. When the new town area of Birchwood was created, most of the bunkers were demolished, but 4 of them were left in place and can still be seen today.|$|R
50|$|The Southwestern Proving Ground Building No. 5 is an {{ammunition}} <b>storage</b> <b>bunker</b> at 259 Hempstead County Road 279 in Oakhaven, Arkansas, {{northwest of}} the city of Hope. It is located on property that was once part of the Southwestern Proving Ground, a major military facility during World War II whose largest portion was transformed into Hope Municipal Airport. Building No. 5 is a single-story concrete structure with a rounded roof, covered in earth, and with a heavy steel door facing northwest. It is one of three ammunition bunkers built on the proving ground (the others, Building Nos. 32 and 33, also survive). The building is used as storage by a private owner.|$|E
5000|$|The 4.5 mi {{single track}} branch opened in 1960 in {{preparation}} for the opening of the colliery in 1963. It left the LD&ECR about a kilometre west of Boughton and turned north. Half the line was in cutting, half on a bank, with a 350 yd tunnel (built to preserve agricultural land), bridges over the River Maun and River Meden and 2 roads and seven bridges over the railway. Bevercotes was described as the first fully automated colliery and also the first to be fully equipped to load coal into Merry-go-round trains [...] Trains were fed by four 35 ton weigh hoppers fed from a 4,000 ton <b>storage</b> <b>bunker</b> built by Head Wrightson. The colliery closed in 1993. The line closed after removal of coal stockpiles.|$|E
50|$|After the war, {{rumors and}} {{theories}} about the bunker abounded because the area had been under highly effective quarantine. Popular but unsupported folklore included tales of secret weapon caches, loot hidden by the fleeing Nazis, and a tunnel to Schirach's private residence. Most of the remaining groundside structures were razed in 1983, apparently to end the repeated clandestine attempts to explore {{the remains of the}} bunker. By 2009 only some remnants of the northern exit remained, as well as three concrete shelters for the guards and five remote entrances to the drainage system which might not connect directly to the actual bunker. Fragments of an ancillary sentry (or according to others, gasoline <b>storage)</b> <b>bunker</b> in the former outer security zone, now mostly buried in the forest loam, can be found close to the nearby road.|$|E

50|$|On November 20, 1983, an {{explosion}} of an explosives <b>storage</b> <b>bunker</b> just south of Pleasant Hill occurred. Reports were that two teenagers were hunting around the area. One of the teenagers may have shot a bullet from a hill which penetrated the bunker ceiling, which is the probable cause of the explosion. The two teenagers {{were killed in the}} explosion leaving only small pieces of shirts. The explosion was felt 45 miles away from the site. At least 25 homes within a mile radius of the explosion suffered damage, doors and windows were blown out, ceilings fell and housed were knocked off their foundations, police said. One house, 300 yards directly up the valley from the shack, suffered a 1-inch-wide crack the entire width of its basement wall.|$|E
50|$|During an {{exhibition}} show where the delinquents face off {{children from the}} Air Force, Wheeler, one of the female delinquents, cons a drug dealer out of $2,000 by handing him a bag of sugar disguised as cocaine. She attempts to take her training plane and fly out to Mexico, but Doug pursues her and tells her to land on an abandoned Air Force base and stay there until further orders. Upon landing the plane, Wheeler and her co-pilot Rudy Marlowe encounter a platoon that is ordered to kill them. Doug intervenes, allowing the teens to leave the air base. Chappy is told of the incident, and he and Maj. Gen. Brad Kettle head to the base that night to investigate on that platoon's activity on a <b>storage</b> <b>bunker.</b> After they are escorted out of the base by Air Force Intelligence, Doug describes to Chappy his eyewitness account of the soldiers carrying marked canisters, which are revealed to be chemical weapons.|$|E
