The ultimate bearing capacity increases with decrease in the clear spacing between the footings and attains a peak magnitude at some critical spacing and thereafter with further decrease in clear spacing, the ultimate bearing capacity decreases and at spacing equal to zero the two footings act as an isolated footing of twice the width when width of two interfering footings are similar and loaded symmetrically. Moreover, the settlement at failure of interfering footing {{is observed}} to be greater than that of isolated footing at failure and the same decreases with increase in clear spacing between the footings. The variation of ultimate bearing capacity and settlement at failure of interfering footings were observed with respect to clearing <b>spacing</b> <b>ratio</b> by introducing efficiency factors which are defined as the ratio of magnitude of ultimate bearing capacity/settlement of interfering footings to that of the magnitude of ultimate bearing capacity/settlement of an isolated footing.The bearing capacity and the settlement of footings are the basic criterion which influence {{in the design of the}} footings and these are affected by the presence of one or more of the footings close to each other; however the interference phenomenon is not considered in the design of shallow footing. In the present scenario the structures may be forced to come close to each other or due to rapid urbanization, the buildings may be constructed in an irregular manner or due to lack of construction space or architecture of the building; the foundations or group of foundation may be laid close to each other which may lead to interference phenomenon and thereby influence the characteristic behaviour of an isolated footing which governs the design criterion and therefore make the motivation in the present study of interference of footings.So far the interference of footings is concerned all most all the study dealt with the interference phenomenon on ultimate bearing capacity and the settlement of interfering footings at failure for two or more closely spaced surface footings resting on either unreinforced or reinforced foundation soil beds. In the literature the foundation soil was considered to be cohesion-less, homogeneous, layered (each layer being homogeneous), Young’s modulus linearly varying with depth etc. and the interfering footings were strip, square, rectangular, circular in shapes resting on the surface of foundation soil medium. Most of the literature dealt with interfering footings of symmetrical geometry and loading conditions except Nainegali et al. Though the interference phenomenon has been observed and studied since Stuart, the effect of interference on the group of footings is not being considered in the design.|$|E

One alternative to individual housing of restricted fed sows is group-housing with ad libitum access to feed. The proposed animal/feeder-trough <b>space</b> <b>ratio</b> of 4 : 1 in the German legislation was taken from housing systems for growing pigs {{due to a lack of}} scientific data on sow to feeder-trough <b>space</b> <b>ratios.</b> The aim of this study was to evaluate practically meaningful animal/feeder-trough <b>space</b> <b>ratios</b> with respect to animal welfare. Therefore, different animal/feeder-trough <b>space</b> <b>ratios</b> between 8 : 1 and 20 : 1 were investigated on three farms. The behaviour at the feeder, as well as health (body scoring), weight gain, back fat thickness and fertility were recorded in gestating sows between days 35 and 110 of pregnancy. The frequency of aggressive interactions and displacements at the feeder was progressively reduced in all tests after grouping the sows. Furthermore, the results pointed out that narrowing the animal/feeder-trough <b>space</b> <b>ratio</b> positively influenced both the conditioning of the sows before lactation and birth weights of the piglets. No clear trend between the different animal/feeder-trough <b>space</b> <b>ratios</b> of group-housed sows was found for the total number born, live and dead born piglets. A small number of sows showed minor injuries, which are not unusual for group housing systems. The evaluated animal/feeder-trough <b>space</b> <b>ratios</b> did not show indications of an impaired well-being of the sows.

In this paper we validate our theoretical results {{in order to justify}} their use in numerical construction of adaptive grids in one dimension. 1. INTRODUCTORY REVIEW The use of adaptive grids is very common in solving ordinary or partial differential equations which exhibit frontal or boundary layer types of behavior. The motivation behind using adaptive grids is to improve the accuracy of solutions at an optimal computational cost by concentrating grid points in appropriate areas. There are many methods which have been developed to generate such adaptive grids [1, 2, 3] in one and two dimensions. In this paper we briefly describe a new method of generating such adaptive grids in one dimension (see also [4]). This method is based on approximating the grid <b>spacing</b> <b>ratio</b> as a continuous variable and using this as the prime generator of these adaptive grids. This method ensures that the grid <b>spacing</b> <b>ratio</b> is a smooth function and provides very high resolution. Oscillations in the grid <b>spacing</b> <b>ratio</b> are not desirable as these may cause serious problems in obtaining accurate solutions of partial differential equations numerically. This is particularly true when implici...|$|E

The investigation focuses on effects of <b>spacing</b> <b>ratio</b> (L/D) and aspect ratio (H/D) on 3 -D flow characteristics, {{and the force}} and pressure coefficients of the cylinders. Extensive 3 -D numerical simulations were performed at Reynolds number of 200 for L/D from 1. 6 to 5. 0 at H/D= 16 and H/D from 6 to 20 at L/D= 3. 5. The {{results show that the}} 3 -D numerical simulations have remedied the inadequacy of 2 -D simulations and the results are in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The relation between 3 -D flow patterns and pressure characteristics around the four cylinders is examined and discussed. The critical <b>spacing</b> <b>ratio</b> for flow pattern transformation was found to be L/D= 3. 5 for H/D= 16, while a bistable wake pattern was observed at L/D= 1. 6 for the same aspect ratio. Moreover, a transformation of flow pattern from a stable shielding flow pattern to a vortex shedding flow pattern near the middle spanwise positions of the cylinders was observed and was found to be dependent on the aspect ratio, <b>spacing</b> <b>ratio,</b> and end wall conditions. Due to the highly 3 -D nature of the flows, different flow patterns coexist over different spanwise positions of the cylinders even for the same aspect ratio. It is concluded that <b>spacing</b> <b>ratio,</b> aspect ratio, and the no-slip end wall condition have important combined effects on free shear layer development of the cylinders and hence have significant effects on the pressure field and force characteristics of the four cylinders with different spacing ratios and aspect ratios.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to investigate whether in the clinical setting of second trimester ultrasound (US) investigations, 3 D multiplanar correction prior to the measurement of Down syndrome (DS) facial markers (nasal bone length, prenasal thickness, fetal profile line, maxilla-nasion-mandible angle, prenasal thickness to nasal bone length <b>ratio,</b> and prefrontal <b>space</b> <b>ratio)</b> is superior to subjective judgment of a correct midsagittal plane by 2 D technique. MethodsMeasurements were performed on 2 D images and 3 D volumes (corrected to the midsagittal plane), acquired during the same scanning session. ResultsAll six markers were measured in 105 datasets (75 of euploid fetuses and 30 of DS fetuses). The maxilla-nasion-mandible angle measured on 2 D images was significantly larger than on 3 D volumes (p ConclusionsNasal bone length, prenasal thickness, fetal profile line, prenasal thickness to nasal bone length <b>ratio,</b> and prefrontal <b>space</b> <b>ratio</b> can be confidently used as DS markers in second trimester US examinations performed by 2 D US.

The BARCs have modifiable optical properties and can be removed during the resist development step. Several dual patterning schemes were investigated for trench printing. The most promising process produced 110 nm trenches with approximately 1 : 1 <b>space</b> <b>ratios.</b> The etch characteristics of these BARCs under fluorinated and oxygenated gases were determined...|$|R
