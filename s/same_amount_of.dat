It is considered to owe to that the connective tissue surrounding tumor proliferates more markedly on that side than that on the lesser curvature and suppresses the growth of the cancer by enclosing. Rabbits were used for the following experiments. 1. The <b>same</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> Brown-Pearce tumor stocks were inoculated at the same in the greater and lesser curvatures of the same rabbit. The growth was always stronger in the lesser curvature. 2. The <b>same</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> foreign bodies (hard paraffin, silk thread and fluid paraffin) were enbedded or injected at the same time into the greater and lesser curvatures of the same rabbit.

5|$|Although {{satellite}} {{males are}} on average slightly smaller and lighter than residents, the nutrition of the chicks does not, as previously thought, influence mating strategy; rather, the inherited mating strategy influences body size.

Satellite males {{do not have to}} expend energy to defend a territory, and can spend more time foraging, so they {{do not need to be}} as bulky as the residents; indeed, since they fly more, there would be a physiological cost to additional weight.|$|E
5|$|Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP-plants {{which use}} many thin mirror strips instead of {{parabolic}} mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This {{has the advantage}} that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can {{be placed in the}} <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.|$|E
5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This {{is partly due to}} the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise.

With poor communications, in the Early Middle Ages most settlements needed to achieve a degree of self-sufficiency in agriculture.

Arable farming grew in the High Middle Ages and agriculture entered a period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century.|$|E

5|$|In 1914, Franck {{teamed up}} with Hertz to perform an {{experiment}} to investigate fluorescence. They designed a vacuum tube for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapour of mercury atoms. They discovered that when an electron collided with a mercury atom it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9electron volts) of its kinetic energy before flying away. A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely the <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> its kinetic energy. Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy.|$|E

5|$|The {{metabolism}} of bupropion {{is highly}} variable: the effective doses of bupropion received by persons who ingest the <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> the drug may differ {{by as much}} as 5.5times (with a half-life of 12–30hours), while the effective doses of hydroxybupropion may differ {{by as much as}} 7.5times (with a half-life of 15–25hours). Based on this, some researchers have advocated monitoring of the blood level of bupropion and hydroxybupropion. The half-lives of erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion are roughly 23–43hours and 24–50hours respectively.|$|E

5|$|After the {{resolution}} of all disputes, sixteen parties received at least one seat in the People's Representative Council, while eight received none. The inconsistency {{in the order of}} parties according to votes received and seats allocated arose due to a special rule created to address uneven population distribution between Java and other islands. This rule stipulates that the Hare quota values for the provinces in Java were on average higher than those for the outer islands. A party require fewer votes to automatically secure a seat outside of Java. For example, the National Awakening Party (PKB) received more votes than the National Mandate Party (PAN) but received nearly the <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> seats. More than half of PKB seats were received in the party's stronghold of East Java, where the quota value was higher. In contrast, only four of PAN seats were automatically secured.|$|E
5|$|As the {{additional}} main battery turrets with their associated magazines used {{a great amount}} of space within each already-limited ship, Capps was forced to economize in other ways to stay within the tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the space between the fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make room for torpedo protection. The biggest drawback was in propulsion: {{there was no room for}} engines that could provide the <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> power as on previous battleships. Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been at this point that he considered turbine propulsion, for which he would have needed extra room.
