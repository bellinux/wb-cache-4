5000|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>ports</b> (also called Secondary place [...] in some {{countries}} like Australia), on the other hand, are ports for which tides have to be calculated, based on a primary port with a similar tidal curve. Some examples of <b>Secondary</b> <b>ports</b> are Rabigh, Porto Novo, Porbandar, Port Cornwalis, Sharjah, The Sandheads (Hugli), etc.|$|E
50|$|The Classis Moesica was {{established}} sometime between 20 BC and 10 AD. It {{was based in}} Noviodunum and controlled the Lower Danube from the Iron Gates to the northwestern Black Sea {{as far as the}} Crimea. The honorific Flavia, awarded to it and to the Classis Pannonica, may indicate its reorganization by Vespasian around 75 AD. After Domitian (in 85 AD) it was headquartered in Sexaginta Prista. After Trajan's conquest of Dacia, during which the Classis Moesica provided logistical support, its base was moved to Noviodunum. The fleet also included several <b>secondary</b> <b>ports,</b> like Novae, Oescus and Tomis (modern Constanta). From 41 AD detachments were stationed in Crimea and Tyras.|$|E
50|$|A few {{models of}} {{full-face}} mask {{are provided with}} <b>secondary</b> <b>ports</b> to which additional demand valves can be connected, either by screw connector (Ocean Reef) or by bayonet style connector (Draeger). These allow for bailout or decompression gas to be ported to the mask via an entirely independent scuba set, but {{it is necessary to}} control which gas is used at any given time by using a valve on the supply line or cylinder.The Draeger Panorama mask also allows the primary demand valve to be unplugged from the mask and a bailout demand valve to be substituted. This can be done underwater with very little water ingress to the mask, and is closely equivalent to switching demand valves with a half mask, but a little slower and more complex.|$|E
40|$|Compound {{aerospike}} nozzles {{were designed}} and tested {{as part of}} an ongoing experimental study to determine the feasibility of thrust vectoring an aerospike nozzle {{with the addition of a}} <b>secondary</b> <b>port.</b> Earlier phases of the study have indicated that a compound aerospike nozzle could provide sufficient thrust vectoring. The addition of a hole-type <b>secondary</b> <b>port</b> was found to provide effective thrust vectoring. Experiments were carried out to determine the effects of <b>secondary</b> <b>port</b> size, <b>secondary</b> <b>port</b> inlet geometry and compound aerospike nozzle chamber pressure. Results show good predictability, axisymmetric flow, and emphasize the importance of a radius on <b>secondary</b> <b>port</b> inlet geometry...|$|R
5000|$|A ring {{is formed}} by {{configuring}} a Domain. Each domain {{has a single}} [...] "master node" [...] and many [...] "transit nodes". Each node will have a primary <b>port</b> and a <b>secondary</b> <b>port,</b> both known {{to be able to}} send control traffic to the master node. Under normal operation, the <b>secondary</b> <b>port</b> on the master is blocked for all protected vlans.|$|R
50|$|When {{there is}} a link down situation, the devices that detect the failure send a control message to the master, and the master will then unblock the <b>secondary</b> <b>port</b> and {{instruct}} the transits to flush their forwarding databases. The next packets sent by the network can then be flooded and learned out of the (now enabled) <b>secondary</b> <b>port</b> without any network disruption.|$|R
50|$|A {{dual port}} {{wastegate}} adds a second port {{on the opposite}} side of the actuator. Air pressure allowed to enter this second port aids the spring to push harder in the direction of closing the wastegate. This is exactly the opposite of the first port. The ability to help the wastegate remain closed as boost pressure builds can be increased. This also adds further complexity to boost control, requiring more control ports on the solenoid or possibly a complete second boost control system with its own separate solenoid. Use of the second port is not necessary. <b>Secondary</b> <b>ports,</b> unlike primary ports, cannot be simply attached to a boost control line and require electronic or manual control to be useful. CO2 can also be used to apply pressure to the second port, to control boost on a much finer level.|$|E
40|$|Two {{distinct}} {{types of}} ports handle French deep-sea cargo: global ports of Northern Range and Marseilles serve {{a great number}} of overseas regions (forelands) and <b>secondary</b> <b>ports</b> mainly serve niche markets. In this paper we demonstrate that global ports serve also larger hinterlands, but their superiority over <b>secondary</b> <b>ports</b> depends on the types of cargo handled. The results of a spatial interaction model demonstrate that most of types of cargo flows are strongly distance-constrained. This evidence indicates that, despite a deep transformation on forelands, the <b>secondary</b> <b>ports</b> subsist because they partly depend on niche markets and local economies generating substantial amounts of non-containerised cargo flows. Some implications of this finding are suggested...|$|E

30|$|No {{systematic}} reviews on pain {{related to}} laparoscopic port instruments were found. A total of seven RCTs evaluated postoperative pain after {{the use of}} REA instruments to standard port instruments for primary and/or secondary port entry. For primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>ports,</b> two RCTs found no differences (n[*]=[*] 77 and n[*]=[*] 56) [11, 15] and one {{was in favor of}} REA instruments (n[*]=[*] 87) [12]. For primary ports specifically, one RCT found no difference (n[*]=[*] 244) [10] whereas another RCT indicated less postoperative pain up to 12  h postoperative in patients where REA instruments were used (n[*]=[*] 100) [13]. For <b>secondary</b> <b>ports</b> specifically, two RCTs reported less postoperative pain when REA instruments versus conventional instruments were used (n[*]=[*] 68 and n[*]=[*] 54) [16, 17].

30|$|As {{previously}} noted, {{the use of}} blunt trocars {{compared to}} cutting trocars for <b>secondary</b> <b>port</b> entry possibly leads to fewer TSHs. This is explained through the stretching and separating of tissues by blunt trocars rather than cutting through tissue layers by cutting trocars. This could be a reason for not closing a fascial defect with a diameter ≤ 12  mm, where a blunt trocar has been used.|$|R
30|$|There were {{no major}} complications. No cases {{required}} insertion of a <b>secondary</b> <b>port.</b> Each patient recovered well and were discharged {{on the first}} post-operative day. Minimal pain was reported. There was an excellent cosmetic result. Estimated blood loss {{was the same as}} for the multi-port equivalent. Overall operating time was slightly longer than for traditional laparoscopy, however following port insertion the actual surgery took a similar length of time.|$|R
30|$|Results: Minimal access {{techniques}} are particularly advantageous in pregnancy. Laparoscopy {{in the presence}} of a large pelvic mass is technically more challenging, especially when uterine manipulation is not possible. In our tertiary service we used Palmer’s point entry, higher <b>secondary</b> <b>ports</b> and optical entry systems to achieve a successful outcome.|$|E
30|$|The {{insertion}} of <b>secondary</b> <b>ports</b> should be visualized laparoscopically, {{taking care to}} avoid injury to the vessels and viscera.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{position of the}} instrument ports {{is very important in}} the performance of surgical procedures endoscopically. The angle the instruments make with the operative site and to each other should mimic, as far as possible to the natural relationship of the hands and eyes during conventional surgery. It is proved that {{the most common cause of}} stressful minimal access surgery is wrong port position. Ninty five percent of surgeon and gynecologists use umbilicus as primary port but at the time of inserting <b>secondary</b> <b>port</b> there is controversy among operator and they lack the principles behind <b>secondary</b> <b>port</b> position. PRIMARY PORT POSITION The central location and ability of the umbilicus to camouflage scars makes it an attractive primary port site for laparoscopic surgery. There are many drawbacks with umbilicus as well. Umbilicus is a naturally weak area due to absence of all the layers. Weakness is also due its location at the midpoint of the abdomen’s greatest diameter. It is easy to believe that there is a difference between the umbilicus and other trocar sites in both susceptibility to infection and postoperative incisional herniation. The study showed that the increased infection rate at the umbilicus seems to be related t...|$|R
