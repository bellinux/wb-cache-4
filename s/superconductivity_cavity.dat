40|$|Extensive R&D {{efforts are}} being {{invested}} at CERN into the fundamental {{science of the}} RF <b>superconductivity,</b> <b>cavity</b> design, niobium sputtering, coating and RF properties of superconducting cavities. Fast and precise characterization and measurements of RF parameters of the newly produced cavities is essential for advances with the cavity production. The currently deployed analogue measurement system based on an analogue phase discriminators and tracking RF generators is not optimal for efficient work at the SM 18 superconducting cavity test stand. If exact properties of the cavity under test are not known a traditional feedback loop {{will not be able}} to find resonant frequency in a reasonable time or even at all. This is mainly due to a very high Q factor. The resonance peak is very narrow (fraction of a Hz at 100 MHz). If the resonant frequency is off by several bandwidths, small changes of the cavity field during the tuning will not be measureable. Also cavity field will react only very slowly to any change of the drive signal. A new techniques to find and track the cavity resonance faster, as well as to keep the cavity field constant under strong microphonics and helium pressure variations must be found to meet the deadlines for the HIE Isolde machine. Therefore a new fully digital measurement and conditioning system based on the available existing hardware from the LHC and SPS must be designed and built...|$|E
40|$|Multipacting {{is one of}} {{the major}} loss {{mechanisms}} in rf <b>superconductivity</b> <b>cavities</b> for accelerators. This loss mechanism limits the maximum amount of energy/power supported by the cavities. Optimal designs have been identified in othersâ€™ studies. In practice, these designs are not easily manufactured. Chemical etching processes used to polish the cavity walls result in a nonuniform surface etch compromising the optimal geometrical design. Past multipacting studies have not examined the impact of wall perturbations. It is the purpose of this study to examine the chemical etching process in the design of niobium cavities so to maximize the surface quality of the cavity walls while minimizing the multipacting losses. Single and multiple cavity cell geometries are to be investigated. Optimization techniques will be applied in search of the chemical etching processes, which will lead to cavity walls with near ideal properties...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a Casimir cavity {{consisting of two}} parallel thin Aluminum planes, cooled below the critical temperature for the onset of superconductivity. It is shown that the transition to superconductivity leads to a sensible change {{in the value of}} the Casimir energy. This gives rise to a number of testable effects, ranging from a shift {{in the value of the}} critical magnetic field, required to destroy the <b>superconductivity</b> of the <b>cavity,</b> to a possible reentrance in the normal phase...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{engineered}} quantum systems, there is a demand for superconducting tunable devices able to operate with high Q-factors at power levels equivalent to only a few photons. In this work, we developed a 3 D microwave reentrant cavity with such characteristics ready to provide a very fine-tuning of a high-Q resonant mode over a large dynamic range. This system has an electronic tuning mechanism based on a mechanically amplified piezoelectric actuator, which controls the resonator dominant mode frequency by changing the cavity narrow gap by very small displacements. Experiments were conducted at room and dilution refrigerator temperatures showing a large dynamic range up to 4 GHz and 1 GHz, respectively, and were compared to a FEM model simulated data. At elevated microwave power input, nonlinear thermal effects were observed to destroy the <b>superconductivity</b> of the <b>cavity</b> due to the large electric fields generated in the small gap of the reentrant cavity...|$|R
