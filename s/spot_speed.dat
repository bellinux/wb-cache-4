They may behave differently on the road as well, yet they are often treated similarly to passenger vehicles in emissions modeling. Although not frequently considered in calculating emission rates, differences in the operating speeds of passenger vehicles and heavy trucks may influence emissions. The main goal of this research project was to evaluate whether heavy trucks typically travel at significantly different operating speeds than passenger vehicles and what impact differences in on-road speeds would have on emissions. Average <b>speeds</b> and <b>spot</b> <b>speeds</b> were collected for heavy trucks and passenger vehicles for four arterial segments and <b>spot</b> <b>speeds</b> were collected for two freeway segments in Des Moines, Iowa. Average and <b>spot</b> <b>speeds</b> were collected for four arterial segments and three freeway segments in the Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota metropolitan area. The results of this research show that heavy trucks and passenger vehicles operate differently on the road.

40|$|Sweeping {{beams of}} light can cast spots moving with superluminal speeds across {{scattering}} surfaces. Such faster-than-light speeds are well-known phenomena {{that do not}} violate special relativity. It is shown here that under certain circumstances, superluminal spot pair creation and annihilation events can occur that provide unique information to observers. These spot pair events are not particle pair events [...] they are the sudden creation or annihilation {{of a pair of}} relatively illuminated spots on a scattering surface. Real spot pair illumination events occur unambiguously on the scattering surface when <b>spot</b> <b>speeds</b> diverge, while virtual spot pair events are observer dependent and perceived only when real <b>spot</b> radial <b>speeds</b> cross the speed of light. Specifically, a virtual spot pair creation event will be observed when a real <b>spot's</b> <b>speed</b> toward the observer drops below c, while a virtual spot pair annihilation event will be observed when a real <b>spot's</b> radial <b>speed</b> away from the observer rises above c. Superluminal spot pair events might be found angularly, photometrically, or polarimetrically, and might carry useful geometry or distance information. Two example scenarios are briefly considered. The first is a beam swept across a scattering spherical object, exemplified by spots of light moving across Earth's Moon and pulsar companions. The second is a beam swept across a scattering planar wall or linear filament, exemplified by spots of light moving across variable nebulae including Hubble's Variable Nebula. In local cases where the sweeping beam can be controlled and repeated, a three-dimensional map of a target object can be constructed. Used tomographically, this imaging technique is fundamentally different from lens photography, radar, and conventional lidar. Comment: 30 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in PAS...|$|R

Using these relationships and a simulation procedure for the <b>spot</b> <b>speed</b> process, a formulation for predicting the reliability of traffic flow moving along the offside lane on the freeway roadway was derived. Through this formulation and the measurements of flow rate and speed, the probability of instability of the roadway under examination was calculated. Furthermore, with an inverse procedure, the capacity of a lane was estimated: setting the reliability value close to 1 and considering a 15 min interval, the resulting flow rate represented the capacity. Thus, the simulation procedure was used to provide, in real time, the incoming instability conditions on the roadway and to estimate roadway capacity for the A 22 Brenner Freeway, Italy...|$|E

This research is carried out on Teuku Umar Street, one of 4 / 2 D road in Bandar Lampung City - Indonesia. Standard calculation used in this research is Indonesian Highway Capacity Manual (IHCM). Primary data used in the analysis is the data derived from field survey of traffic counting, <b>spot</b> <b>speed,</b> and space mean speed. The value of PceMC is determined based on the assumption of the ratio of road space utilization by motor cycle. The correction value of PceMC is calculated using trial and error method in order to find the minimum difference between light vehicle speed value (DVLV) from graph analysis and the one from <b>spot</b> <b>speed</b> survey data. Research indicates that the correction value of PceMC for Teuku Umar Street is 0. 323.

It has become a useful parameter utilized by both planners as well as road users in evaluating the operational performance of highways and intersections (level of service). However, travel time on a highway {{is bound to be}} influenced by external factors especially the traffic flow properties and hence it is commonly expected that as flow on a given road section increases the travel time is bound to be increased until a certain point; capacity. This study was conducted by cordoning Skudai town along natural and artificial boundaries and selecting four road sections to represent the study area.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of motorway reliability {{is a subject}} of great interest for researchers of traffic engineering. For easy recognizable reasons, this subject {{is very important in}} theoretical studies and for applications, e. g. {{evaluation of}} capacity and traffic control on motorway. In this paper the different conceptions of reliability in technical and scientific literature are compared with the following definition: reliability of traffic stream, for a time interval T, is “the conditioned probability that level of speed spot process does not decrease during T as far as the section in which limit density is reached, given that the level at instant zero is equal to the average speed corresponding to the flow rate in condition of stable flow”. Then, a criterion to calculate the motorway reliability is presented. The speed spot time-series are divided into sequences of events of random and homogeneous traffic processes. For every process one can calculate two parameters: flow rate and density; then, one can obtain the relationships between the parameters of <b>spot</b> <b>speed</b> processes and vehicular density. Using these relationships and a simulation procedure of <b>spot</b> <b>speed</b> process, one can obtain a formulation of the reliability of a traffic flow running along the offside lane of a motorway carriageway. Thus, through this formulation and the measurements of flow rate and speeds, one can evaluate the probability of instability on the carriageway under investigation. On the other hand, with an inverse procedure one can calculate the capacity of one lane in this way: putting close to 1 the reliability value and considering a 15 minutes time interval, the obtained flow rate represents capacity.
