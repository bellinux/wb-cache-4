Despite their overall relatedness, different secre-tins use different specific and general mechanisms for their targeting, assembly, and membrane insertion. We report that all tested <b>secretins</b> from several type II secretion systems and from the filamentous bacteriophage f 1 can spontaneously multimerize and insert into liposomes in an in vitro transcription-translation system. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that these <b>secretins</b> form a group distinct from the <b>secretins</b> of the type IV piliation and type III secretion systems, which do not autoassemble in vitro.

40|$|In Gram-negative bacteria, the Lol and Bam {{machineries}} {{direct the}} targeting of lipidated and nonlipidated proteins, respectively, {{to the outer}} membrane (OM). Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains with depleted levels of specific Bam and Lol proteins, we demonstrated a variable dependence of different OM proteins on these targeting pathways. Reduction {{in the level of}} BamA significantly affected the ability of the β-barrel membrane protein OprF to localize to the OM, while the targeting of three <b>secretins</b> that are functionally related OM proteins was less affected (PilQ and PscC) or not at all affected (XcpQ). Depletion of LolB affected all lipoproteins examined and had a variable effect on the nonlipidated proteins. While the levels of OprF, PilQ, and PscC were significantly reduced by LolB depletion, XcpQ was unaffected and was correctly localized to the OM. These results suggest that certain β-barrel proteins such as OprF primarily utilize the complete Bam machinery. The Lol machinery participates in the OM targeting of <b>secretins</b> to variable degrees, likely through its involvement in the assembly of lipidated Bam components. XcpQ, but not PilQ or PscC, was shown to assemble spontaneously into liposomes as multimers. This work raises the possibility that there is a gradient of utilization of Bam and Lol insertion and targeting machineries. Structural features of individual proteins, including their β-barrel content, may determine the propensity of these proteins for folding (or misfolding) during periplasmic transit and OM insertion, thereby influencing the extent of utilization of the Bam targeting machinery, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Known {{inducers}} of the phage shock protein (Psp) system {{suggest that}} it is an extracytoplasmic stress response, as are the well-studied RpoE and Cpx systems. However, a random approach to identify conditions and proteins that induce the Psp system has not been attempted. It is also unknown whether the proteins or mutations that induce Psp are specific or if they also activate the RpoE and Cpx systems. This study addressed these issues for the Yersinia enterocolitica Psp system. Random transposon mutagenesis identified null mutations and overexpression mutations that increase Φ(pspA-lacZ) operon fusion expression. The results suggest that Psp may respond exclusively to extracytoplasmic stress. Null mutations affected glucosamine- 6 -phosphate synthetase (glmS), which plays a role in cell envelope biosynthesis, and the F 0 F 1 ATPase (atp operon). The screen also revealed that in addition to several <b>secretins,</b> the overexpression of three novel putative inner membrane proteins (IMPs) induced the Psp response. We also compared induction of the Y. enterocolitica Psp, RpoE, and Cpx responses. Overexpression of <b>secretins</b> or the three IMPs or the presence of an atpB null mutation only induced the Psp response. Similarly, known inducers of the RpoE and Cpx responses did not significantly induce the Psp response. Only the glmS null mutation induced all three responses. Therefore, Psp is induced distinctly from the RpoE and Cpx systems. The specific IMP inducers may be valuable tools to probe specific signal transduction events of the Psp response in future studies...|$|R

There was some controversy about the different scenarios, since they all explain protein homology between the two structures, as well as their functional diversity. Yet, recent phylogenomic evidence favours the hypothesis that the T3SS derived from the flagellum by a process involving initial gene loss and then gene acquisition.

YscC has been shown to exist as a stable oligomeric complex in the outer membrane. The production of the YscC complex is regulated by temperature and is reduced in strains carrying mutations in the yscN-U operon or in the virG gene. The VirG lipoprotein was shown to be required for efficient targeting of the complex to the outer membrane. Electron microscopy revealed that purified YscC complexes form ring-shaped structures of approximately 20 nm with an apparent central pore.

Large placebo-controlled studies of olanzapine and aripiprazole were underway in early 2008. Aripiprazole may be effective for treating autism in the short term, but is also associated with side effects, such as weight gain and sedation. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and dopamine blockers can reduce some maladaptive behaviors associated with ASD. Although SSRIs reduce levels of repetitive behavior in autistic adults, a 2009 multisite randomized controlled study found no benefit and some adverse effects in children from the SSRI citalopram, raising doubts whether SSRIs are effective for treating repetitive behavior in autistic children. A further study of related medical reviews determined that the prescription of SSRI antidepressants for treating autistic spectrum disorders in children lacked any evidence, and could not be recommended. One study found that the psychostimulant methylphenidate was efficacious against hyperactivity associated with ASD, though with less response than in neurotypical children with ADHD. Of the many medications studied for treatment of aggressive and self-injurious behavior in children and adolescents with autism, only risperidone and methylphenidate demonstrate results that have been replicated. A 1998 study of the hormone <b>secretin</b> reported improved symptoms and generated tremendous interest, but several controlled studies since have found no benefit.

To obtain {{an overview of}} the virulence potential of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, an oral and systemic human pathogen implicated in aggressive periodontitis, we used a combined LC-MS/MS and bioinformatics approach to characterize the secretome and protein secretion pathways of the rough-colony serotype a strain D 7 S. LC-MS/MS revealed 179 proteins secreted during biofilm growth. Further to confirming the release of established virulence factors (e. g. cytolethal distending toxin [CDT], and leukotoxin [LtxA]), we identified additional putative virulence determinants in the secretome. These included DegQ, fHbp, LppC, Macrophage infectivity protein (MIP), NlpB, Pcp, PotD, TolB, and TolC. This finding indicates that the number of extracellular virulence-related proteins is much larger than previously demonstrated, which was also supported by in silico analysis of the strain D 7 S genome. Moreover, our LC-MS/MS and in silico data revealed that at least Type I, II, and V secretion are actively used to excrete proteins directly into the extracellular space, or via two-step pathways involving the Sec/Tat systems for transport across the inner membrane, and outer membrane factors, <b>secretins</b> and auto-transporters, respectively for delivery across the outer membrane.

40|$|Various gram-negative {{animal and}} plant {{pathogens}} use a novel, sec-independent protein secretion system as a basic virulence mechanism. It is becoming increasingly clear that these so-called type III secretion systems inject (translocate) proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells, where the translocated proteins facilitate bacterial pathogenesis by specifically interfering with host cell signal transduction and other cellular processes. Accordingly, some type III secretion systems are activated by bacterial contact with host cell surfaces. Individual type III secretion systems direct the secretion and translocation {{of a variety of}} unrelated proteins, which account for species-specific pathogenesis phenotypes. In contrast to the secreted virulence factors, most of the 15 to 20 membrane-associated proteins which constitute the type III secretion apparatus are conserved among different pathogens. Most of the inner membrane components of the type III secretion apparatus show additional homologies to flagellar biosynthetic proteins, while a conserved outer membrane factor is similar to <b>secretins</b> from type II and other secretion pathways. Structurally conserved chaperones which specifically bind to individual secreted proteins {{play an important role in}} type III protein secretion, apparently by preventing premature interactions of the secreted factors with other proteins. The genes encoding type III secretion systems are clustered, and various pieces of evidence suggest that these systems have been acquired by horizontal genetic transfer during evolution. Expression of type III secretion systems is coordinately regulated in response to host environmental stimuli by networks of transcription factors. This review comprises a comparison of the structure, function, regulation, and impact on host cells of the type III secretion systems in the animal pathogens Yersinia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, and Chlamydia spp. and the plant pathogens Pseudomonas syringae, Erwinia spp., Ralstonia solanacearum, Xanthomonas campestris, and Rhizobium spp...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{membranes}} {{are vital}} components of all living systems, forming {{the boundaries of}} cells and their organelles. They consist of a lipid bilayer and embedded proteins, which are nanomachines that fulfill key functions such as energy conversion, solute transport, secretion, and signal transduction. Some membrane proteins form domains, which can vary and adapt to the functional state of the cell. Intact membrane complexes or solubilized membrane-bound complexes can be studied by electron microscopy (EM) and single particle analysis. This technique allows obtaining structural information in a rather easy way up to 10 - 20 Å resolution without using crystals, which are obligatory in X-ray diffraction studies. The technique has gained in popularity {{at the cost of}} the crystallographic approach, which uses two-dimensional (2 -D) crystals. Such 2 -D crystals of purified membrane proteins, reconstituted in the presence of lipids, provide a close to native environment and allow the structure and function of membrane proteins to be assessed. It was demonstrated in the nineties that electron crystallography can solve high-resolution structures of membrane proteins and very recently single particle averaging established itself also as a high resolution technique. A cryo-EM reconstruction of viral protein 6 (VP 6) of a rotavirus was similar in clarity to a 3. 8 -Å resolution map obtained from x-ray crystallography. At this resolution, most of the amino acid side chains produced recognizable density. For non-symmetric objects such as membrane proteins this resolution is not achievable, but single particle averaging at lower resolution is still attractive if applied to negatively stained specimens with a mass between about 200 kDa and 2000 kDa. A major reason is that thousands of projections can be processed very fast, yielding 2 D projection maps of at least 20 Å resolution. The statistical analysis and classification procedures used in single particle analysis have been developed for sorting different projection views originating from different conformations or subunit compositions. In this thesis we present here some examples which show that single particle electron microscopy can be wider applied than just performing a structure determination of a highly purified large protein complex. Obtaining two-dimensional projection maps is a fast process but assignment of these maps can be a tedious process. The method is very suitable for determination of transient complexes or complexes that are inherently heterogeneous or simply small. The method works on the level of a specialized membrane, as we show here for the membrane complex of two pathogenic Neisseria species. Chapter 1 gives a general introduction about the protein structure, with an emphasis on membrane proteins. It also includes general information about the examined organisms, some important cellular processes and protein complexes, relevant to the topics studied in this thesis. Theoretical aspects of electron microscopy (EM), specimen preparation and image analysis are also presented. This chapter further contains a compilation of the recent progress in the field of electron microscopy, with an emphasis on structural biology. Chapter 2 presents a study on some membrane-associated peroxins (Pex proteins). These particular Pex proteins are involved in protein import over the membrane in peroxisomes. Studies were performed with a model organism, the yeast Hansenula polymorpha. Single particle electron microscopy was used to analyze the structure of purified Pex 5 p and its possible association with Pex 20 p. The results showed that Pex 5 p can physically interact with Pex 20 p. We observed that a multimeric Pex 20 p complex can bind to the periphery of the Pex 5 p tetramer. Moreover, in this Pex 5 p-Pex 20 p complex, the conformation of tetrameric Pex 5 p was changed from a closed conformation with a diameter of 115 Å into an open conformation of 134 Å. EM data also showed that the Pex 5 p-Pex 20 p complex was capable to bind native, folded catalase, a peroxisomal PTS 1 protein. This suggests that the Pex 5 p-Pex 20 p complex may be functional as receptor complex. After completing the practical work of Chapter 2, we realized that peroxisomal membrane protein complexes are good candidates for further EM investigation since virtually no direct structural information of these complexes is available. In chapter 3 a pilot study of the major peroxisomal membrane complexes in the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Hansenula polymorpha is presented. We monitored the presence and purification of large, hypothetical pex complexes by western blotting with specific antibodies against Pex 14 p. The results showed that upon 1 D and 2 D/SDS Blue Native gel electrophoresis from peroxisomal fractions only a few protein bands could be attributed to peroxisomes. Moreover, no large Pex protein complexes were found, which we also proved by mass spectrometry. It was realized that this could be related to the relatively low protein content of the peroxisomal membranes compared to mitochondrial membranes. By using differential and sucrose density centrifugation to obtain a rather pure peroxisomal fraction, we faced the problem that mitochondria were a major contaminant in the best purified peak fractions. We conclude that further purification of the initial membranes is crucial, which requires more advanced techniques and better separation protocols to separate peroxisomes from mitochondria. Chapter 4 of this thesis presents three secondary transporter proteins: GltT of Bacillus stearothermophilus, CitS of Klebsiella pneumoniae and GltS of Escherichia coli, which were studied by single particle electron microscopy. Image processing showed that a GltT particle map with three-fold symmetry is in line with the trimer observed in the crystal structure of a homologous protein, GltPh of Pyrococcus horikoshi. The other secondary transporter: CitS showed two main views as a kidney-shaped particle and a biscuit-shaped particle, both with a long axis of 160 Å and a short axis of 84 Å. The last examined secondary transporter: GltS was similarly shaped but smaller with dimensions of 150 Å x 84 Å. By comparing the shapes and dimensions of the CitS and GltS particles with the GltT particle, we suggest that the former two were in the dimeric state. In addition, a 10 kDa protein tag (Biotin Acceptor Domain, BAD) was fused to the N-terminus of the CitS protein or inserted in the central cytoplasmic loop which connects the two putative domains of the protein. Results from single particle EM analysis of the two proteins revealed differently shaped particles relative to the untagged protein. N-terminally tagged CitS revealed a more globular shape relative to the wild type. The aspect ratios were 1. 77 and 1. 9, respectively. We observed, that the inserted BAD domain resulted in an extended particle with an aspect ratio of 2. 14. A model is presented for the relative orientation of monomers in the CitS dimer. In chapter 5 we studied the structure of the PilQ <b>secretins</b> from Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis. The complex embedded in isolated outer membranes, was investigated by electron microscopy and single particle image analysis. Results showed that analyzed oligomers within the native membrane, revealed additional domains, which were not observed in studies using purified proteins. The structure of PilQ complexes of N. gonorrhoeae showed a double ring structure with a clear 14 -fold symmetry of the outer ring, and a 14 - 15 -fold symmetry in the inner ring. In addition, from the 14 protein densities of the outer ring 7 external spikes are protruding. Moreover, PilQ complexes of N. meningitidis also consisted of two rings, together with complexes partly or completely lacking the outer ring. Our results showed, that the outer ring of the N. menigitidis PilQ had a 19 -fold symmetry and no external spikes were observed. The inner ring structures for both N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis were of similar size as the structures previously observed from the isolated PilP/PilQ complexes, demonstrating that the second ring and the external spikes do not contain domains of the PilQ or PilP proteins. Further investigation of the composition of the outer ring and the spikes of the PilQ complexes from several N. gonorrhoeae knock-out mutants showed some changes in the composition of the outer rings. A knock-out of PilP did not show presence of the spikes, which means that this protein might be directly or indirectly involved in the spike composition. Moreover, the PilP knock-out also showed a change in the symmetry of the outer ring from 14 to 19 fold. A PilF mutant also did not show spikes either, however, maintained the 14 -fold symmetry of the outer membrane. We concluded, that PilC 2 and PilW mutants yielded similar structures as observed for the wild-type, indicating that they are not involved in these structures. These results and our observations could indicate that our structure composed of two rings and spikes is a high rotational flexibility, especially the connection of the two rings is flexible. Therefore, we concluded that the second ring and spikes my have a role in stabilizing the anchoring of the PilP/PilQ complexes with the membranes. ...|$|R

Ductal cells of the pancreas are stimulated by the hormone <b>secretin</b> to produce their bicarbonate-rich secretions, in what is in essence a bio-feedback mechanism; highly acidic stomach chyme entering the duodenum stimulates duodenal cells called [...] "S cells" [...] to produce the hormone <b>secretin</b> and release to the bloodstream. <b>Secretin</b> having entered the blood eventually comes {{into contact with the}} pancreatic ductal cells, stimulating them to produce their bicarbonate-rich juice. It {{is interesting to note that}} <b>secretin</b> also inhibits production of gastrin by [...] "G cells", and also stimulates acinar cells of the pancreas to produce their pancreatic enzyme.|$|E
50|$|The mature <b>secretin</b> peptide is {{a linear}} peptide hormone, which is {{composed}} of 27 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 3055. A helix is formed in the amino acids between positions 5 and 13. The amino acids sequences of <b>secretin</b> have some similarities to that of glucagon, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP). Fourteen of 27 amino acids of <b>secretin</b> reside in the same positions as in glucagon, 7 {{the same as in}} VIP, and 10 the same as in GIP.|$|E
50|$|A wave {{of enthusiasm}} for <b>secretin</b> as a {{possible}} treatment for autism arose in the 1990s based on a hypothetical gut-brain connection; {{as a result the}} NIH ran a series of clinical trials that showed that <b>secretin</b> was not effective, which brought an end to popular interest.|$|E
