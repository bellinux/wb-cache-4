40|$|Web-based {{customization}} <b>self-services</b> encourage {{consumers to}} co-develop products, heightening expectations {{that anyone can}} engage in creative work. Yet personal creative ability and experience may vary greatly. This research examines how Web-based customization <b>self-services</b> may be designed to better support a customer’s experience and performance with the service and suggest that designers of online customization systems consider and apply such an approach. Drawing from psychological and human computer interaction research concerned with motivating and sustaining creativity, and investigating popular online examples, we formalize a set of design principles to support customer creativity within Web-based customization <b>self-services</b> including: providing an optimal challenge, autonomy, community, encouragement, and resources, giving permission to take risks, facilitating goal setting, supporting positive affect, and encouraging mastery experiences.

5|$|During Nixon's {{visit to}} the Soviet Union in 1959, Khrushchev took part in what later {{became known as the}} Kitchen Debate. Nixon and Khrushchev had an impassioned {{argument}} in a model kitchen at the American National Exhibition in Moscow, with each defending the economic system of his country. Khrushchev was invited to visit the United States, and did so that September, spending thirteen days. Khrushchev arrived in Washington, DC on his first {{visit to the}} United States on 15 September 1959. The first visit by a Soviet premier to the United States resulted in an extended media circus. Khrushchev brought his wife, Nina Petrovna, and adult children with him, though it was not usual for Soviet officials to travel with their families. The peripatetic premier visited New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco (visiting a supermarket), Coon Rapids, Iowa (visiting Roswell Garst's farm), Pittsburgh, and Washington, concluding with a meeting with U.S. President Eisenhower at Camp David. During luncheon at the Twentieth Century-Fox Studio in Los Angeles Khrushchev engaged in an improvised yet jovial debate with his host Spyros Skouras over the respective merits of capitalism and communism. Khrushchev was supposed to visit Disneyland, but the visit was canceled for security reasons, much to his disgruntlement. He did, however, visit Eleanor Roosevelt at her home in Hyde Park, New York. While visiting IBM's new research campus in San Jose, California, Khrushchev expressed little interest in computer technology, but he greatly admired the <b>self-service</b> cafeteria, and, on his return, introduced <b>self-service</b> in the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Every {{station is}} {{equipped}} with General Ticketing Machines (GTMs), a Passenger Service Centre and LED or plasma displays that show train service information and announcements. All stations are equipped with restrooms and payphones; some restrooms are located at street level. Some stations, especially the major ones, have additional amenities and services, such as retail shops and kiosks, supermarkets, convenience stores, automatic teller machines, and <b>self-service</b> automated kiosks {{for a variety of}} services. Heavy-duty escalators at stations carry passengers up or down at a rate of 0.75m/s, 50% faster than conventional escalators.|$|E
5|$|Facilities at {{the station}} are minimal – {{there are a few}} chairs and {{timetable}} information is provided. Help points, giving next train information, were installed in 2010. There is no ticket office, but there are <b>self-service</b> ticket machines which can be used to buy or collect tickets. The Victorian-era station building is only original station building left on the line, decorated with a mural painted by local students, it is used as an upholsterer's showroom rather than for railway purposes. Access is step-free from South Road, through an area containing residents' garages. The platform backs onto the gardens {{on the south side of}} the road.|$|E

40|$|Technological {{breakthroughs}} {{have generated}} {{new forms of}} services, such as <b>self-services</b> or remote services. In this paper, we discuss how these new types of technology-based services are qualitatively different from traditional service provision, how they fit into existing service typologies and provide an extension of existing frameworks to capture their unique characteristics. Based on this, we outline managerial implications and open research questions...|$|R
5|$|In February 2007 it {{was found}} that when {{customers}} added value to their cards at <b>self-service</b> add-value points located in MTR and Light rail stations, their bank accounts were debited even if the transactions had been cancelled. Octopus Cards Limited claimed that the fault was due to an upgrade of communication systems. Initially, two cases were reported. The company then announced that the use of the payment system, Electronic Payment Services (EPS), at add-value service points would be suspended until further notice, and that it had started an investigation into the reasons for the problem.|$|E
5|$|Network Rail own {{and manage}} the track and signalling; {{stations}} and services are operated by the existing train operating company, Arriva Trains Wales; and the local authorities each own and operate the station car parks in their area.

All stations on the branch are unstaffed, and at first lacked any ticket issuing facilities; but in late 2009 a Scheidt & Bachmann Ticket XPress <b>self-service</b> ticket machine was installed at each station.|$|E
5|$|Various {{types of}} pancake {{machines}} exist, {{such as those}} that run pancake batter through a heated conveyor inside of a box unit, and those that automatically drop pancake batter onto a flattop grill. Some pancake machines, such as one developed by Crepe-Coer, cook both sides of a pancake simultaneously. Semi-automatic pancake machines also exist, which require some human interaction to function, such as the pouring of batter. Commercial pancake machines may be used in the foodservice industry, in cafeterias and by restaurants, and can serve to reduce the waste of stale pancake batter. Some hotels have pancake machines that guests are allowed to operate. They are also used in other environments in a <b>self-service</b> manner, such as in upscale airport lounges and hotels.|$|E
50|$|To {{meet the}} {{increasing}} demand for more responsive, ‘anywhere, anytime’ services today, enterprises can develop real-time recognition-enabled customer services and products to speed up data acquisition and processing times.

Our proposed design focuses on establishing and maintaining connectedness without involving cluster heads.|$|R
25|$|In 1956, Alan Sainsbury became {{chairman}} {{after the}} death of his father, John Benjamin Sainsbury. During the 1950s and 1960s, Sainsbury's was a keen early adopter of <b>self-service</b> supermarkets in the United Kingdom; the first <b>self-service</b> store within the country was a co-operative store opened in 1942. On a trip to the United States of America, Alan Sainsbury realised the benefits of <b>self-service</b> stores and believed the future of Sainsbury's was <b>self-service</b> supermarkets of , with eventually the added bonus of a car park for extra convenience.
