5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time.

40|$|Nasal drug {{delivery}} {{can be assessed}} {{by a variety of}} means and regulatory agencies, e. g., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have published a set of guidelines and regulations proposing in vitro test methods for the characterization of nasal drug products. This article gives a summary of the FDA and EMA requirements regarding the determination of droplet size distribution (DSD), plume geometry, spray pattern and <b>shot</b> <b>weights</b> of solution nasal sprays and discusses the analytical challenges that can occur when performing these measurements. In order to support findings from the literature, studies were performed using a standard nasal spray pump and aqueous model formulations. The aim was to identify possible method-, device- and formulation-dependent influencing factors. The literature review, as well as the results from the studies show that DSD, plume geometry and spray pattern are influenced by, e. g., the viscosity of the solution, the design of the device and the actuation parameters, particularly the stroke length, actuation velocity and actuation force. The dominant factor influencing <b>shot</b> <b>weights,</b> however, is the adjustment of the actuation parameters, especially stroke length and actuation velocity. Consequently, for routine measurements assuring, e. g., the quality of a solution nasal spray or, for in vitro bioequivalence studies, the critical parameters, have to be identified and considered in method development in order to obtain reproducible and reliable results...|$|R

50|$|Lead {{has several}} {{properties}} {{that make it}} useful: high density, low melting point, ductility, and relative inertness to oxidation.

In the late 19th century, lead was recognized as highly toxic, and since then it has been phased out for many applications.

50|$|Rotational Molding (BrE moulding) {{involves}} a heated hollow mold which {{is filled with}} a charge or <b>shot</b> <b>weight</b> of material. It is then slowly rotated (usually around two perpendicular axes), causing the softened material to disperse and stick to {{the walls of the}} mold. In order to maintain even thickness throughout the part, the mold continues to rotate at all times during the heating phase and to avoid sagging or deformation also during the cooling phase. The process was applied to plastics in the 1940s but in the early years was little used because it was a slow process restricted to a small number of plastics. Over the past two decades, improvements in process control and developments with plastic powders have resulted in a significant increase in usage.|$|E

5000|$|A wrist shot {{is a type}} {{of hockey}} shot that {{involves}} using arm muscles (especially those in the wrist and forearm) to propel a puck forward from the [...] side of the blade of a hockey stick. Generally, when the puck is shot in a similar manner using the [...] side of the blade, it is referred to as a backhand shot. The power of a wrist shot comes from lower body strength more than arm strength. The advantage of a wrist shot over a slap shot is the minimal amount of setup required, creating an element of surprise. Moreover, a wrist shot is far more accurate than a slap shot. Conversely, the reliance on wrist and forearm muscles to propel the puck causes the wrist shot to be less powerful than the slap shot, though this is not true for all players, even those with [...] "big shots". Transfer of bodyweight and the flex of a hockey stick are also key factors for a wrist <b>shot.</b> <b>Weight</b> should shift from the back leg to the front leg for maximum power. The flex of a stick is also key for a powerful wrist shot. Applying energy and weight onto your stick gives a whip like motion and thus provides your shot with even more power.

40|$|The {{modern era}} of tennis has seen large changes in racket design and playing style. As {{regulators}} of the game, the International Tennis Federation have assumed a role of constant investigation. Recently, impact {{models have been}} used to assess the characteristics of various rackets. Whilst existing models are powerful, they are limited in terms of impact position and racket and ball movement. Realistic shot characteristics of 13 elite level players at the 2006 Wimbledon Qualifying Tournament were obtained. Two high speed cameras running at 1, 000 frames per second were used to record ball and racket movements within a fully calibrated 2 x 2 x 2 in control volume to an accuracy of ± 2. 5 mm. It was found that players tend to hit a point on the racket stringbed which generates little to no frame vibration. Forehand shots had an outbound ball spin of 800 - 2, 200 rpm, ball velocities in the region of 25 - 40 ms'. The results from the player shot analysis were used in the design of a repeatable impact methodology. Nine hundred laboratory based racket/ball impacts were analysed in 3 D. A custom racket mount simulated grip torque. The experimental outputs were interpreted using a multi-variate fitting technique. The experimental results were used in model validation. A predictive impact model was developed. When validated against the laboratory and player testing results, the model showed good correlation. The model was used to investigate the effects of <b>shot</b> <b>weighting,</b> movement and accuracy on post-impact ball behaviour. It was found that: Increasing swing action weighting increases the velocity of tip impacts. Increasing weight towards the edge of the racket reduces the penalty for hitting off the racket's longitudinal axis. A `chopping' action generates ball spin. The model developed in this study can be incorporated into existing shot prediction software used by the International Tennis Federation...|$|R
