60|$|There were so {{many men}} on the ground, however--for just then a third engine dashed up {{to the scene of}} conflagration--that it was {{difficult}} for the excited boy to appreciate fully what he saw. He got as close to the engine, however, as the policemen would allow him, and observed that a fire-plug had been already opened, and over it had been placed a canvas cistern of about a yard long by eighteen inches broad, stretched on an iron frame. The cistern was filled with water to overflowing, and the first engine had placed its <b>suction-pipe</b> in it, while {{from the front of the}} engine extended the leathern hose that conveyed the water to the burning house.|$|E
60|$|Instantly {{the active}} youths sprang to their work. Some got the hose {{out of the}} box of an engine and {{uncoiled}} it length by length towards the house, others screwed the lengths together {{at the same time that}} the water-trough was being set up and the <b>suction-pipe</b> attached. Meanwhile, some had run up into the building, and from an upper window let down a rope so as to be ready to drag up the hose when it was made long enough to reach them. Thus they practised during the forenoon the mimic warfare with the flames which they should have to carry into actual operation at night. In another part of the yard a foreman was instructing some recruits in the use of the fire-escape. Under a neighbouring archway stood a small group of idlers looking on at these stirring operations, one of these was Philip Sparks, another was the Bloater. The interests of the first had taken him there, the second had been led to the scene by his affections. Sparks did not observe the Bloater, but the Bloater being unusually sharp, had observed Sparks, and, with a look of surprise and glee at the unexpected sight, set himself to watch and listen.|$|E
6000|$|Before {{the engine}} from Regent Street {{came on the}} ground, two manual engines from Kensington and Notting Hill had arrived, and opened water on the foe. At first their shot fell harmlessly on the roaring furnace; {{but by the time}} the [...] "steamer" [...] had got ready for action, some little effect was {{beginning}} to be produced. When this great gun, so to speak, began to play, and sent a thick continuous stream through the windows, like an inexhaustible water mitrailleuse, clouds of white steam mingled with the black smoke, and varied the aspect of the fire, but did not appear to lessen its fury in any degree. Just then another manual engine dashed into the square at full gallop, and formed up. Before it had well taken a position, another [...] "steamer," [...] with three horses, came swinging round the corner, and fell into the ranks. The panting steeds were unharnessed, the bold charioteers leaped down, the <b>suction-pipe</b> was dipped into the water-trough, and the hose attached. As two engines cannot [...] "drink" [...] at the same plug, a canvas trough with an iron frame is put over the plug, having a hole in its bottom, which fits tightly round the plug. It quietly fills, and thus two or more engines may do their work convivially--dip in their suction-pipes, and [...] "drink" [...] simultaneously at the same fountain.|$|E

"The fact was," [...] said he, [...] "that {{we had had}} {{a fearful}} time of it that winter--blowin' great guns an' snow nearly every night, an' what wi' heat at the fires an' cowld i' the streets, an' hot wather pourin' on us at wan minnit an' freezin' on us the nixt, a'most every man Jack of us was coughin' an' sneezin', and watherin' so bad at our eyes an' noses, that I do belave if we'd held 'em over the <b>suction-pipes</b> we might ha' filled the ingins without throublin' the mains at all. So the doctor he said, says he, `Lads, I'll send ye a bottle o' stuff as'll put ye right.' An' sure enough down comes the bottle that night when we was smokin' our pipes just afther roll-call. It {{turned out to be}} the best midcine ever was. `Musha!' says I, `here's the top o' the marnin' to ye, boys!' Baxmore he smacks his lips when he tastes it, opens his eyes, tosses off the glass, and holds it out for another. `Howld on; fair play!' cried Jack Williams, so we all had a glass round. It was just like {{lemonade}} or ginger-beer, it was. So we sat down an' smoked our pipes over it, an' spun yarns an' sung songs; in fact we made a jollification of it, an' when we got up to turn in there warn't a dhrop left i' the bottle.|$|R

5000|$|... {{near the}} bottom of Euston Square, there is the mouth of the tube, and there are the {{travelling}} trucks, ready to be thrust into it; and as we look, a bell rings at some distance up the rail - this is a signal that a mail-train has arrived... At this signal we hear a shovel of coke thrown into a furnace, a small steam-engine begins to beat swiftly... the pneumatic wheel ... is twenty-one feet in diameter, and is composed of two discs of iron... These discs are braced together by spoke-like partitions, and these partitions communicate with an opening for the entrance of air about the axis. As this wheel rapidly revolves, the air is sucked in at its centre, and thrown off ... at its open rim or edge. This gale is not allowed to disperse itself, however, but when any work has to be done, is confined within a paddle-box, and allowed to pass out ... through a pipe in connection with the great pneumatic despatch tube... Here, then, we have the means of pulling or pushing the travelling carriages along their subterranean road, and as we speak we see it in operation: for a mail-guard opens a door, throws in two or three mail-bags just snatched out of the guard's van as it rolls into the mainline station, the iron carriages are shoved into the tube, the air-tight door at its mouth is closed... and we hear them rumbling off on their subterranean journey at a rate, we are informed, of twenty miles an hour... a bell connected with an electric telegraph warns him that the attendant {{at the other end of}} the tube is about to thrust the carriage into the tube on its return journey. It has been pushed along... by the pressure of air thrown out by the wheel, but it has to be pulled back by suction; the valve of the <b>suction-pipe,</b> in the connection with the centre of the disc, is accordingly opened, and speedily we hear a hollow rumbling, and out shoots the carriage, ready once more for fresh bagsThe company sought to develop further lines within London, and attempted to raise an additional £125,000 (£ in [...] ), of capital. The prospectus proposed a network of lines between [...] "points so important that it is unnecessary to dwell upon the magnitude of the traffic that must naturally arise between them". The first line was to have been a route linking the Camden Town and Euston (Square) stations of the London and North Western Railway.|$|E
