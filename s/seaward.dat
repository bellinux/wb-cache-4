5|$|The dock {{entrance}} {{is on the}} east side of Barry Island, which protects it from winds from the west and southwest. Two rubble breakwaters with six ton stone blocks on the <b>seaward</b> side protect the entrance from winds from other directions.|$|E
5|$|Although Captain Apolinar Calvo of the Corregidor {{had prior}} {{experience}} navigating the mined entrance to Manila Bay (the mines {{had been in}} place since July), the Navy had changed its procedures on that day. Rather than post a gunboat near the safe channel as they had in days previous, lighted buoys were used to guide boats through. As the Corregidor sailed close to the island of Corregidor {{to pass through the}} channel at around 01:00, the ship was observed turning toward the electrically-controlled minefield. Some officers posted at the Army's <b>Seaward</b> Defense Command headquarters on the island recommended that the mines be temporarily disarmed so that the ship could pass through the minefield. A number of accounts state that <b>Seaward</b> Defense Commander Colonel Paul Bunker ordered that the mines be kept active.|$|E
5|$|During their occupation, the French began {{construction}} {{of a series of}} fortifications on Richmond Hill. Designed to defend against an attack like theirs, its cannons pointed to the landward rather than <b>seaward</b> side. These defences were completed by the British after 1783.|$|E

5|$|In 1910, further {{additions}} {{included the}} Floral Hall, {{adjacent to the}} Moorish Pavilion at the <b>seaward</b> end. The hall—a winter garden and concert hall—had a seating capacity of 850; it was built of steel and plate glass to a design by Arnold England.|$|E
5|$|Navy strikes were {{launched}} from the aircraft carriers of Task Force 77, cruising off the North Vietnamese coast at Yankee Station. Naval aircraft, which had shorter ranges (and carried lighter bomb loads) than their air force counterparts, approached their targets from <b>seaward</b> {{with the majority}} of their strikes flown against coastal targets.|$|E
5|$|The {{island has}} several ayres, or storm beaches, which form narrow spits of shingle or sand cutting across the landward and <b>seaward</b> ends of shallow bays. They can {{sometimes}} {{cut off a}} body of water from the sea, forming shallow freshwater lochs known as oyces. Examples include Vasa Loch and Lairo Water.|$|E

5|$|During the 16th and 17th centuries {{the castle}} {{continued}} to be maintained and modified; the <b>seaward</b> half of the castle {{was turned into a}} solid gun platform and additional accommodation was built for the fort's gunners. A bulwark was built {{on the east side of}} the castle and an additional gun battery was placed on the town's quay, just to the west. For most of the English Civil War of the 1640s it was held by Parliament; following the Restoration, it was refortified by Charles II in the 1670s.|$|E
5|$|East Antarctica {{is a cold}} {{region with}} a ground base above sea level and {{occupies}} most of the continent. This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually <b>seaward</b> glacial flows. The mass balance of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet {{as a whole is}} thought to be slightly positive (lowering sea level) or near to balance. However, increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions.|$|E
5|$|Huge {{flocks of}} more than a million common {{starlings}} may be observed just before sunset in spring in southwestern Jutland, Denmark over the <b>seaward</b> marshlands of Tønder and Esbjerg municipalities between Tønder and Ribe. They gather in March until northern Scandinavian birds leave for their breeding ranges by mid-April. Their swarm behaviour creates complex shapes silhouetted against the sky, a phenomenon known locally as sort sol ("black sun").|$|E

50|$|In 1836 the {{brothers}} {{brought out the}} direct-acting steam engines for HMS Gorgon and HMS Cyclops, which were known as <b>Seaward's</b> engines. They superseded the heavy side-beam engines of the period which had been in general use. The saving obtained in the consumption of fuel by the double-slide valve, both for the steam and exhaust, plus other improvements, caused the government to entrust the <b>Seawards</b> with the building of twenty-four steamboats and some smaller vessels.|$|R

5|$|In May 2000, twenty {{trees were}} planted, {{one for each}} boys who attended. During the {{planting}} ceremony, the Scout Chief Commissioner for England, along {{with representatives of the}} Scouts and the Guides, planted the trees on the <b>seaward</b> side of the original site. The trees were designed to act as a permanent memorial to the camp, as well as providing a series of future windbreaks against coastal winds.|$|E
5|$|Made of Carboniferous Limestone, it is a {{continuation}} of the Mendip Hills. Two further continuations are the small islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm. The cliffs on the northern and southern flanks of Brean Down have large quantities of fossils laid down in the marine deposits about 320–350 million years ago. The site has been occupied by humans since the late Bronze Age and includes the remains of a Romano-Celtic Temple. At the <b>seaward</b> end is Brean Down Fort which was built in 1865 and then re-armed in the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|St. Helen and St. Anthony Bastions {{are located}} on the <b>seaward</b> side, facing Valletta. They {{originally}} had echaugettes and gunpowder magazines, but the echaugettes on both bastions were dismantled in the 19th century, and the magazine on St. Anthony Bastion was demolished {{to make way for}} three QF 12-pounder gun emplacements. The magazine on St. Helen Bastion is still intact. The curtain wall linking these two bastions contains the main gate, which is protected by a lunette known as the Couvre Porte.|$|E

5|$|The Basin gates contain many sluices, so {{water can}} be quickly drained out or let in {{according}} to whether the sea level is above or below the prevailing docks water level but more water is lost from No.1 dock supply if the Basin water is lowered to the <b>seaward</b> side of the lock gates instead of using the Lady Windsor lock sluices. In the early days, the dock operators would often run the water down {{to bring in a}} single ship having a wider beam than the Lady Windsor lock could handle.|$|E
5|$|The Finns assured Yartsev that Finland was {{committed}} to a policy of neutrality, and the country would resist any armed incursion. Yartsev was {{not satisfied with the}} reply, given Finland's military weakness. He suggested that Finland could cede, or lease, some islands in the Gulf of Finland along the <b>seaward</b> approaches to Leningrad, a suggestion the Finns rejected. Earlier in the mid-1930s, the Soviet ambassador in Helsinki, Eric Assmus, and the Leningrad Bolshevik party leader Andrei Zhdanov, had presented a similar proposal.|$|E
5|$|The pier {{was sold}} to the Noble Organisation in 1984. The theatre was removed two years later, on the {{understanding}} {{that it would be}} replaced; however a domed amusement arcade was put in place instead. Consequently, the <b>seaward</b> end of the pier was filled with fairground rides, including thrill rides, children's rides and roller coasters. Entertainment continued to be popular at the pier; the Spice Girls made an early live performance there in 1996 and returned the following year after achieving commercial success.|$|E
