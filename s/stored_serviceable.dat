50|$|They were a {{long-lived}} class, {{with only}} one, the 1004, being retired prior to May 1953. By December 1954 however, the Soo Line was effectively dieselized. One locomotive, the 1003, {{was placed in}} the strategic reserve, and <b>stored</b> <b>serviceable</b> in the Gladstone, Michigan roundhouse. The other eight remaining L-1s were sold for scrap.|$|E
50|$|A {{business}} {{downturn in}} 1976 proved {{the end of}} the U50C in service; all were withdrawn, although many were <b>stored</b> in <b>serviceable</b> condition. No return to service occurred, though five were lent out as stationary power generators during a coal miners' strike in early 1978. All were sold for scrap during 1977-1978.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{mission of}} Greenwood Army Air Field (GAAF) was Basic Flight Training and the base {{was home to}} several hundred Consolidated Vultee BT-13 and BT-15 Valiants. The BT's trained thousands of fledgling military aviators. As basic training evolved, various twin-engine trainers such as the Cessna AT-17 and AT-8, and the Beechcraft AT-10 Wichita were brought into the inventory {{in an effort to}} make the transition to advanced twin-engine schools easier. This idea never fully developed and the aircraft were <b>stored</b> in <b>serviceable</b> condition. The field also had the usual complement of Noorduyn Norseman UC-64s, Cessna UC-78s and C-45 Expeditors.|$|R
500|$|A {{number of}} other {{locomotives}} are <b>stored</b> in a <b>serviceable</b> condition by these and other operators (currently, 47501 and 47701 fall into this category). Both these and some preserved locomotives that are maintained to mainline standards (such as [...] "Royal Train" [...] locomotive 47798, along with 47270, 47580, 47715 and 47773) may appear on the network at any time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{remaining}} {{five were}} included in the sale of Australian National to Australian Southern Railroad in November 1997. As of January 2016 all locomotives are now stored with 701 (since December 2015), 703 (since December 2015) & 704 (since 2014) <b>stored</b> <b>serviceable</b> and 705 stored after a major failure in 2015. 706 had been in long term storage after a major failure in 2005 and has been scrapped during 2016 ...|$|E
5000|$|JA 1240 [...] "Jessica" [...] was {{preserved}} by Blenheim man Peter Coleman, and was <b>stored</b> <b>serviceable</b> at his Blenheim property. In 1988 after his death, JA 1240 {{was purchased by}} Ian Welch, and in 1990 travelled to the Mainline Steam Heritage Trust's Parnell depot. This locomotive's restoration for mainline use (as a coal burner) has been completed, and is based in Christchurch. It has been named after one of owner Ian Welch's granddaughters.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, the Lynx consortium, {{including}} Bombardier and SNC-Lavalin {{proposed a}} 320 km/h high-speed train from Toronto to Quebec City via Kingston, Ottawa and Montreal {{based on the}} TGV and the French Turbo-Train technology. Recently, Bombardier and Via have proposed high-speed services along the Quebec City-Windsor corridor using Bombardier's experimental JetTrain tilting trains, which are similar to Bombardier's Acela Express, but powered by a gas turbine rather than overhead electric wires. These trains resemble the first TGV prototype (TGV001) powered by a gas turbine that were tested on the Strasbourg-Mulhouse line. After promotional stops in the USA and Canada, no government purchased the Jet Train. As of August 2012, the Jet Train now sits idle. The prototype is <b>stored</b> <b>serviceable</b> at the AAR/FRA Transportation Technology Center at Pueblo, Colorado, USA.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} other {{locomotives}} are <b>stored</b> in a <b>serviceable</b> condition by these and other operators (currently, 47 501 and 47 701 fall into this category). Both these and some preserved locomotives that are maintained to mainline standards (such as [...] "Royal Train" [...] locomotive 47 798, along with 47 270, 47 580, 47 715 and 47 773) may appear on the network at any time.|$|R
50|$|The New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) was {{originally}} established with Captain W T Beck as Deputy Assistant Director of Ordnance Services(DADOS), {{and a small}} staff. On {{the arrival of the}} main body in Egypt, Temp Sergeant Levien was attached to the British Ordnance Corps Depot at the Citadel in Cairo to study the Ordnance systems in use with the Imperial forces in Egypt. As preparation for the Gallipoli campaign progressed, the New Zealand Ordanance organisation was developed and equipped the force in accordance with Instruction G1089. To support the force a depot was established at No. 12 Rue de la, Porte Rosette and a warehouse at Shed 43, Alexandra Docks in Alexandria. After the withdraw from Gallipoli, the New Zealand Division was reorganised and prepared for redeployment to France, the Alexandra depot was closed, un-serviceable stores disposed of by auction and remaining <b>serviceable</b> <b>stores</b> not required by the NZ Division handed over to the Imperial Ordnance.|$|R
5000|$|The AIBN {{also found}} {{reason to believe}} that one of the HUMS accelerometers {{installed}} in the aircraft {{would have been able to}} alert maintenance crew about the change in vibration patterns in time to avoid the accident had it been serviceable since it was configured with a setpoint value. Retrospective analysis of HUMS data showed that vibrations at the location where this accelerometer was mounted was above the setpoint value before the accident. The part of HUMS that was <b>serviceable</b> <b>stored</b> relevant information, but those data had to be retrieved by maintenance staff and analyzed between flights. At the time of the accident, usage of HUMS in offshore helicopters was in an early phase and not required by regulations. The cracks had been developing slowly for several days before the catastrophic failure occurred, and if HUMS data had been systematically retrieved and analyzed between flights the change in vibration patterns might have been discovered by maintenance staff before the fatal flight. Regulation of HUMS in offshore helicopters was one of 18 recommendations in the final AIBN report. The AIBN report and the unrealized potential of HUMS in avoiding this accident was discussed at the 2003 HUMS Conference in Melbourne and was described as [...] "a defining moment" [...] for HUMS in offshore helicopter operations.|$|R
50|$|Today Southern Railway 1401 {{is one of}} {{the attractions}} at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Southern cosmetically {{restored}} the locomotive just before sending it for display at the Smithsonian, and it was probably <b>stored</b> <b>serviceable</b> when it was retired from active service, but it has not operated in more than half a century. When Graham Claytor was a Southern executive in the mid-1960s, he attempted to lease 1401 from the Smithsonian for operational use in Southern's steam excursion program. The Smithsonian refused, and Claytor leased Southern Railway 4501 (originally a freight locomotive with a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement) and painted it in the green, gold, and silver scheme instituted for the Ps-4s. Accordingly, it seems unlikely that 1401 will ever steam again. However it {{is believed to have been}} in good condition when retired, and has spent most of the time since inside, it is probably in relatively good internal and mechanical condition. Cosmetically, it is in excellent shape. In 2012, the locomotive made an appearance in an episode of Parks and Recreation.|$|E
