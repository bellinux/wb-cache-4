50|$|A <b>sail</b> <b>batten</b> is a {{flexible}} insert in a fore-and-aft sail that provides added stiffness and definition to the sail's airfoil cross-section. The most common use of sail battens {{is in the}} roach of a mainsail. The batten extends the leech past the line that runs from the head and the clew of the sail to create a wider sail towards the top. Cruising sailboats may have four to six battens. Racing sailboats may have full-length battens, as well, that allow for better sail shape. Battens are also found in jibs of beach-cat catamarans. Most battens are fiberglass pultrusions with a thin, rectangular cross section.|$|E

50|$|Blokarts are raced in {{two classes}} - {{production}} and performance, and in various weight divisions. The production class {{is based on}} the basic blokart design. In the performance class additional parts from the manufacturer are allowed such as carbon fibre mast sections and an aerodynamic shell, adjustable downhaul and modification of the <b>sail</b> <b>battens</b> to alter the shape of the sail. Blokarts have four standard sail sizes, 2.0m, 3.0m, 4.0m and 5.5m, with sail size choice being dependent on wind strength and weight of the sailor, with heavier sailors requiring larger sails, and smaller sails being more efficient in stronger winds.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>sailing,</b> <b>battens</b> are long, {{thin strips}} (usually {{fiberglass}} or some similar material nowadays, but historically wooden) {{used to support}} the roach of a sail. They are also used on tall ships to form the ladders up the shrouds in a fashion similar to ratlines. They are also used to help secure tarpaulins over hatches, thus giving rise to the common phrase [...] "batten down the hatches!", meaning to secure the hatches against an approaching storm. Used by analogy in non-sailing contexts, it means to prepare to weather a coming storm, whether that storm is metaphorical or literal.|$|R
50|$|In sailing, lying ahull is a {{controversial}} method of weathering a storm, by downing all <b>sails,</b> <b>battening</b> the hatches and locking the tiller to leeward so the boat tries {{to point to}} windward but this is balanced {{by the force of}} wind and waves. A sea anchor is not used, allowing the boat to drift freely, completely {{at the mercy of the}} storm. Ideally the boat should rest with the wind just forward of the beam so the boat is not broadside onto the waves. Modern boats with fin keels may have too much windage at the bows for this technique and come to rest broadside on or may not be stable at all.|$|R
5000|$|The fully <b>battened</b> <b>sail</b> is much {{heavier than}} a sail made entirely of {{sailcloth}} with modern battens.|$|R
50|$|Junk rigs {{essentially}} {{have the}} stack of sails, but without all the gaps between them. Where the yards controlled the towers of square <b>sails,</b> the <b>battens</b> controlled the junk sail. In East Asia, the largest and the smallest boats traditionally use junk sails, and vessels are not named by sail type, but by region, function, and other characteristics.|$|R
50|$|Beginners' sails {{often do}} not have battens, so they are lighter {{and easier to use}} in light winds. However, as the sailor improves, a <b>battened</b> <b>sail</b> will provide greater {{stability}} in stronger winds.|$|R
50|$|The term junk {{may be used}} {{to cover}} many kinds of boat—ocean-going, cargo-carrying, {{pleasure}} boats, live-aboards. They vary greatly in size and there are significant regional variations in the type of rig, however they all employ fully <b>battened</b> <b>sails.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Rotational <b>sails</b> have <b>battens</b> which {{protrude}} {{beyond the}} back {{aspect of the}} mast. They flip or [...] "rotate" [...] {{to the other side}} of the mast when tacking or jibing, hence the rotation in the name. Rotational sails have an aerofoil shape on the leeward side when powered, but are nearly flat when sheeted out (unpowered). In comparison with cambered sails, rotational designs offer less power and stability when sailing straight, but are easier to handle when maneuvering. Rotational sails are usually lighter and easier to rig.|$|R

Its wing has a span of 35.8 ft, wing area is 228 sq ft and the aspect ratio is 5.6:1. The pilot hook-in weight range is 185 to 550 lb.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{mainsail}}s are [...] "full-batten" [...] mainsails, {{meaning the}} batten extends {{all the way}} from the mast to the leeach of a <b>sail.</b> A partial <b>batten</b> extends from the mast partway to the leech. Battens enable the mainsail to project farther away from the mast. However, there is some cost associated with the battens themselves, [...] "batten pockets" [...] need to be sewn into the sail, and [...] "batten cars" [...] may be needed to allow the sail to be raised and lowered.|$|R
5000|$|Like the pinas, the bedar over 45 feet (LOD), carried two masts, {{one in the}} bow, called [...] "topan", {{slightly}} raked forward; The main mast, called [...] "agung" [...] {{was placed}} a bit forward {{of the center of}} the boat. The bedar had a very long bowsprit, slightly bent downwards by the bobstay. Both masts carried a fully battened lug or [...] "junk-sail" [...] of typical Chinese design.

50|$|The Byte was updated in 2004 {{with the}} {{development}} of a fully <b>battened</b> <b>sail</b> and two piece carbon-fibre mast. This CII rig has a slightly larger sail made of mylar and similar in appearance to the 29er sails. The new rig is designed to be self-depowering and was a welcome update to the previous byte rig. The inspiration for the new rig and sail was to create an out-of-the-box, cost effective, women's and youth boat. These developments give a speed improvement reflected in the Byte CII's Portsmouth Yardstick of 1150 (a 4.2% improvement) and D-PN of 91.4.|$|R
50|$|These boats sailed {{best with}} the wind on the quarter or just aft of the beam. Since the <b>sails</b> are fully <b>battened</b> and may be set almost at a right angle to the boat, {{they were able to}} set the Topan sail to {{windward}}, sailing wing to wing as soon as the wind was well aft of the beam. Going to windward was not the strong point of those junk rigged vessels, since the junk rig performs not as efficiently to windward as the modern Bermuda sail or the Gaff sail and the hulls of the cargo freighters were well rounded and offered not much lateral resistance.|$|R
50|$|The 4000 is a fast, planing skiff-style dinghy with a trapeze for {{the crew}} and trampolines for the helm. Upwind, the boat does not point {{especially}} close to the wind, but its fully <b>battened</b> <b>sails</b> give enough power {{to keep up with}} similar-sized boats. Downwind, however is where the boat excels due to its asymmetric spinnaker (a.k.a. gennaker). In a force 3 the 4000 will plane and the crew will make full use of the trapeze wire. However, force 4-5 is when the boat performs its optimum. The 4000 is fast enough {{to make use of the}} apparent wind to reach the bottom of the racecourse sooner.|$|R

50|$|Designers such as Ian Oughtred have {{produced}} modern versions that incorporate many traditional features while addressing {{some of the}} drawbacks, in particular {{the replacement of the}} shallow, balanced rudder (which had a tendency to lead to wild and erratic steering in big following seas) with a more conventional transom-hung pivoting rudder blade.

5000|$|Although by {{the early}} 1970s many rigid wings were developed, none sold terribly well, while dozens of flexible-wing hang glider {{companies}} were springing {{up all over the}} world. The mid 1970s underwent significant improvements in hang glider design as manufacturers were bringing out new and improved models at a fast rate. From the simple structures of the early 1970s, the aspect ratio of the gliders increased dramatically, <b>sails</b> became tighter, <b>battens</b> became the rule, and the gliders became safer. In the late 1970s preformed aluminium battens became common. The Manta Fledgling IIB dominance at the 1979 US Nationals, invigorated interest in double surface wings and pilot-controlled surfaces.

5000|$|The sails {{include several}} {{horizontal}} members, called [...] "battens", which in principle could provide shape and strength but in practice, {{because of the}} available materials and technology, did neither. Junk sails are controlled at their trailing edge by lines much {{in the same way}} as the mainsail on a typical sailboat, but in the junk <b>sail</b> each <b>batten</b> has a line attached to its trailing edge where on a typical sailboat a single line (the sheet) is attached only to the boom. The sails can also be easily reefed to accommodate various wind strengths, but there was traditionally no available adjustment for sail shape for the reasons given to do with traditional materials. The battens also make the sails more resistant than other sails to large tears, as a tear is typically limited to a single [...] "panel" [...] between battens. In South China the sails have a curved roach especially towards the head, similar to a typical balanced lug sail. The main drawback to the junk sail is its high weight caused by the 6 to 15 heavy full length battens. With high weight aloft and no deep keel, junks were known to capsize when lightly laden due to their high centre of gravity. The top batten is heavier and similar to a gaff. In principle junk sails have much in common with the most aerodynamically efficient sails used today in windsurfers or catamarans. In practice, because of the comparatively low tech materials, they had no better performance characteristic than any other contemporary sail plan, whether western, Arab, Polynesian or other.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design, fabrication and experimental characterization of a capacitive differential pressure transducer, suitable {{to be implemented}} in a wireless sensor network for wind sail monitoring. The network is aimed at sensing the pressure field acting {{on the surface of}} a sail by means of instrumented battens, providing the real-time differential pressure map over the <b>sail</b> surface. Each <b>batten</b> was constructed to house a number of wireless nodes within which a pressure sensing unit was integrated, providing independent pressure measurements. The pressure sensor was fabricated using printed circuit board technology, resulting in a thin, triple-layered structure which comprised a pre-stressed polymeric diaphragm, woven glass reinforced epoxy resin layers and metal layers. During the design phase, numerical simulations were used to estimate the pressure–capacitance static characteristic of the sensor by means of a non-linear, coupled mechanical-electrostatic numerical model. In this paper, we show both numerically and experimentally that inducing a pre-stress in the sensor diaphragm reduced undesired effects due to viscoelasticity, resulting in improved output accuracy. The sensors were experimentally characterized in a pressure range of ± 250 Pa and the results were compared with numerical simulations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{capacitive}} {{differential pressure}} sensor suitable to be implemented in a wireless sensor network has been designed, built, and experimentally tested. The pressure sensing unit is implemented in {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB) technology based on a thin 3 D triple layers structure composed of: a pre-stressed polymeric diaphragm, woven glass reinforced epoxy resin (FR 4) and metal layers. Aim of the developed sensor network is to sense the pressure field acting on the surface of a full <b>battens</b> <b>sail</b> by means of instrumented battens. Inside any instrumented batten an appropriate number of wireless nodes are mounted, the pressure sensing units is integrated in any wireless node, acting as pressure measurement spot. The sensor network is targeted to provide a real time differential pressure map over the sail surface. The pressure sensing unit behavior has been modeled using finite element simulations. By means of a static non-linear coupled mechanical-electrostatic model, has been possible to predict the pressure versus capacitance static characteristic and to tune the geometry of the transducer to reach the required resolution, sensitivity and time response in the appropriate full scale pressure input, ranging from ± 250 Pascal...|$|R
40|$|With its ease of reefing, subtle control, and {{unmatched}} {{ability to}} generate thrust effectively in both severe and minimal weather, the Chinese batten lug is {{perhaps one of the}} most sophisticated sails in history. However, its development remains unclear, as its relatively sudden appearance in the iconographic record as a mature technology, and its seeming lack of affinity to other Chinese sails, gives no indication of a regional evolution. An analysis of the batten lug suggests that it likely descended from some simpler sail. As it is separated from the most rudimentary square rig by several key features, the batten lug's development probably occurred in an incremental, or stepwise, fashion. But, no intermediate form representing such progression of the batten lug has yet been discovered in China, or even in the greater Pacific basin. An examination of iconographic evidence from India and the western reaches of the Roman Empire, however, suggests that <b>sails</b> bearing <b>battens</b> or possessing lug morphology existed in these regions prior to the emergence of the batten lug in China. The question therefore arises whether it is possible that these sails were ancestral to, or in some way influenced the development of, the more sophisticated Chinese sail. In an attempt to answer this question, this thesis considers the significance of diffusion as a mechanism for the dispersal of ideas, both today and in antiquity. It also presents a review of the numerous artifacts and textual accounts that suggest commercial and cultural exchange occurred between the Roman Empire, India and China during the Imperial and early Medieval periods. As a result of these evaluations, it seems possible, and even probable, that the technologies of these regions influenced each other. Considering this possibility, the likely evolution of the batten lug, and the distribution of potentially ancestral forms, this thesis concludes that the development of the batten lug in China may indeed have been influenced or inspired by the sails of India and the western Roman Empire...|$|R
50|$|Raising {{the junk}} sail {{is done by}} easing the sheets until the furled sail is blown down wind. This will take the {{pressure}} off the sail and ease the raising. Then {{it is important to}} watch the lines that will run in while the sail is raised, including the gaff hauling parrel, luff hauling parrel, the downhauls if equipped, and the sheets. Hauling the sail with a 3:1 or 4:1 purchase will ease the burden, but the length of halyard will consequently be very long. The fully <b>battened</b> <b>sail</b> will remain calm in the lee of the mast during the hauling. Due to the weight of a huge canvas sail and its many spars, some junk sailors find a winch is needed for the last few feet. There is probably already a standing tack line in place, so the halyard is hauled until the tack line is taut, although {{there is no need to}} tighten up the leech severely to avoid scallops as in trimming the triangular sails. After hauling and securing the halyard, the fore and aft position of the leech is set by hauling the yard hauling parrel until the halyard is close to the mast. A short pull on the luff hauling parrel may be needed to extend the middle battens toward the leech to control wrinkles in the sail. The last act is to haul the sheets and set the sail to the wind.|$|R
40|$|This artwork {{reports on}} two {{different}} projects that were carried out during the three years of Doctor of the Philosophy course. In the first years a project regarding Capacitive Pressure Sensors Array for Aerodynamic Applications {{was developed in the}} Applied Aerodynamic research team of the Second Faculty of Engineering, University of Bologna, Forlì, Italy, and in collaboration with the ARCES laboratories of the same university. Capacitive pressure sensors were designed and fabricated, investigating theoretically and experimentally the sensor’s mechanical and electrical behaviours by means of finite elements method simulations and by means of wind tunnel tests. During the design phase, the sensor figures of merit are considered and evaluated for specific aerodynamic applications. The aim of this work is the production of low cost MEMS-alternative devices suitable for a sensor network to be implemented in air data system. The last two year was dedicated to a project regarding Wireless Pressure Sensor Network for Nautical Applications. Aim of the developed sensor network is to sense the weak pressure field acting on the sail plan of a full <b>batten</b> <b>sail</b> by means of instrumented battens, providing a real time differential pressure map over the entire sail surface. The wireless sensor network and the sensing unit were designed, fabricated and tested in the faculty laboratories. A static non-linear coupled mechanical-electrostatic simulation, has been developed to predict the pressure versus capacitance static characteristic suitable for the transduction process and to tune the geometry of the transducer to reach the required resolution, sensitivity and time response in the appropriate full scale pressure input A time dependent viscoelastic error model has been inferred and developed by means of experimental data in order to model, predict and reduce the inaccuracy bound due to the viscolelastic phenomena affecting the Mylar® polyester film used for the sensor diaphragm.
