There was also a significant and positive relationship between filled pauses and pragmatic ability after controlling for structural language ability.

30|$|The study still {{shows some}} {{limitations}} {{in using the}} ACF model to the 2015 South Korea civil servant pension reform. First, as mentioned early {{that one of the}} ACF model’s premise is based on the 10  years administration period. Unlike from the United States or other countries that usually last decade for the presidential period, the administration in South Korea only activates 4  years. Second, as most of the references are based on the news, <b>statements,</b> <b>and</b> <b>speech,</b> it was hard to know the changes in the attitudes of each actor or the process of progress during the meeting thoroughly. Future research is required to interview each actor and find out how and why they changed their stances and positions. In addition, it is necessary to study social knowledge and experience about how political consensus on various social conflicts and policy agenda are formed and what civic learning and skills are useful for the reform process (Stone, 2001, 2002). Finally, we need a better theory to explain how knowledge and ideas can contribute to solving various political and social dilemmas embedded into public and social agenda for community innovation(Bekkers et al., 2013; Béland, 2005). Future research is required to examine various successful or unsuccessful policy reforms derived from policy ideas and knowledge.|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} about the aspect of {{translation}} in the process of foreign language teaching. The main attention is paid to translation {{of social and political}} texts such as <b>statements,</b> addresses <b>and</b> <b>speeches</b> of state, party and public figures, all sorts of articles and publications of international, governmental and non-governmental organizations, the number of which is very large in mass media. They contain information of the leading economists on the activities of international financial institutions, reflect the real world of business, and offer a wide range of views and opinions on political events.  Socio-political texts in Russian, as well as in foreign languages, not only provide information about various events or problems, but also make special impact on readers. Particular attention is paid to the lexical units which are used in translation of such texts. Such lexical units reflect the evolution of society, define public relationships.  They are in continual «movement», replacing or supplementing the existing notation systems by words and abbreviations which reflect the emergence of new facts and concepts in the relevant field of social life. Knowledge of this kind of vocabulary enables students to solve practical problems of translation, summarization and annotation of this kind of literature. </p...|$|R

According to Means’ grant proposal, the center would include full-time Indian consultants, Indian teachers, Indian librarians, and an Indian staff leading people around the center in order to tell the story of Indians of All Tribes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a critical discourse analysis, situated within a broad Foucauldian framework, {{focusing on the}} construction of food and eating within the context of youth, schools and education, drawing on <b>speeches,</b> documents <b>and</b> public texts produced or sponsored by members of the UK Coalition government (2010 - 14). Michael Gove, the then Secretary of State for Education spoke of the ‘clear moral purpose’ (June 2011) of the education reform agenda, one key policy of which was the provision of free school meals for all infant school pupils from September 2014. Gove has said of this policy that ‘the reason that is so important is they won’t just get the right nutrition, they will get the right values’ (October 2013). The analysis draws on such <b>statements,</b> <b>and</b> other <b>speeches,</b> policy documents <b>and</b> public availably texts to delineate six discourses. These are the Discourses of: School (Attainment and Community), Health, Party Political Identity, "Manners Maketh Man", Economics and ‘Good Parent/ Bad Parent’.

5000|$|In 1956 the Federation of South African Women {{was founded}} {{and led by}} Lilian Ngoyi and the more famous Helen Joseph. On 9 August that year, the women marched on the Union Buildings in Pretoria, protesting against the pass laws. On the morning of 5 December 1956, however, the police {{detained}} 156 Congress Alliance leaders. 104 African, 23 white, 21 Indian and eight Coloured people were charged with high treason and plotting a violent overthrow of the state, {{to be replaced by}} a communist government. The charge was based on <b>statements</b> <b>and</b> <b>speeches</b> made during both the Defiance Campaign and the Congress of the People. The Freedom Charter was used as proof of the Alliance's communist intent and their conspiracy to oust the government. The State relied greatly on the evidence of Professor Arthur Murray, an ostensible authority on Marxism and Communism. His evidence was that the ANC papers were full of such communist terms as [...] "comrade" [...] and [...] "proletariat", often found in the writings of Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. Halfway through the drawn-out trial, charges against 61 of the accused were withdrawn, and, five years after their arrest, the remaining 30 were acquitted after the court held that the state had failed to prove its case.|$|E

40|$|Variables {{responsible}} {{for the maintenance of}} bizarre vocalizations emitted by an adult diagnosed with schizophrenia were examined via a brief functional analysis, and results suggested that the behavior was maintained by attention. A treatment consisting of ex-tinction and differential reinforcement of appropriate vocalizations was effective in re-ducing bizarre vocalizations and increasing appropriate vocalizations. The use of func-tional analysis methodology to examine variables that maintain problem behavior in this population is discussed. DESCRIPTORS: bizarre vocalizations, brief functional analysis, schizophrenia Hallucinatory speech (i. e., verbal respons-es to unobservable stimuli), delusional speech (i. e., obviously false <b>statements),</b> <b>and</b> perseverative <b>speech</b> (i. e., frequently repeated phrases) are common features of the psychi-atric diagnosis of schizophrenia. Although traditional accounts of these behaviors posit that they are symptoms of an underlying dis-order, behavior analysts view these behaviors as a class of operants that are influenced by environmental contingencies (Wong, 1996). In several studies, bizarre vocalizations in individuals with schizophrenia and related diagnoses have been successfully treated with differential reinforcement (e. g., Ayllon & Michael, 1959; Liberman, Teigen, Patterson, & Baker, 1973). These results suggest that these vocalizations in some individuals with schizophrenia may be maintained by, or at least are sensitive to, social consequences such as attention and escape.
