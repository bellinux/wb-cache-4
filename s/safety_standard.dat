40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically examine how China's food <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> affect {{agricultural}} trade in the case of dairy products. Design/methodology/approach - A gravity model is applied to quantitatively address the impacts of changing food <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> in China in the case of its dairy imports. The paper considers the trade impacts of not only a specific hazard substance but also overall strictness of <b>safety</b> <b>standards.</b> Findings - The paper shows that changes in food <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> of dairy products have no effect on China's dairy imports. The finding is not particularly surprising considering special characteristics of China's food <b>safety</b> <b>standards.</b> Given the fact that China's <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> are relatively lower than that in its major exporters, the trade-impeding effect may not be substantial. Research limitations/implications - First, this study is unable to estimate the trade-enhancing and trade-impending effects separately. Second, the study does not account for a potential endogeneity issue associated with food <b>safety</b> <b>standards.</b> Originality/value - This paper contributes to the debate on how food <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> affect trade by demonstrating that <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> in developing countries like China can affect international trade differently from that in developed countries. Although results are specific to China's dairy imports, the explanations are applicable to food <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> in other developing countries...|$|R

40|$|There {{have been}} growing {{concerns}} {{about the effects of}} food <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> on agricultural trade throughout the world. The objective {{of this paper is to}} assess the impacts of food <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> on tea exports from China, the world's largest tea producer and exporter. To achieve this objective, the paper discusses the trends and nature of China's tea production and export, analyzes changes on tea <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> indicated by Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures, Maximum Residual Limit (MRL) of pesticides and the coverage of tea <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> concerning regulatory pesticides in major importing countries, and quantitatively estimates the impacts of food <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> on China's tea export based on a gravity model. The results show that the MRL of pesticides (e. g., endosulfan, fenvalerate and flucythrinate) imposed by importing countries have significantly affected China's tea exports. The results also show that China's tea exports have been significantly restricted when importing countries increase coverage of tea <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> concerning regulatory pesticides.

40|$|Abstract—Participation {{in global}} trade means that China’s {{vegetables}} and fruits industry faces international food <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> and increased scrutiny worldwide. The objectives of this paper were to investigate how existing food <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> and regulations in the importing countries impact the export of {{vegetables and fruits}} from China. This paper discussed the current and historical situations of China’s vegetables and fruits export from 1996 to 2010, analyzed the Maximum Residual Limit (MRL) standards of pesticides imposed by importing countries, quantitatively estimated the impacts of food <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> on China’s vegetables and fruits export based on a gravity model. The results showed that although transportation distance between trade partners and tariff rates on vegetables and fruits were still the importantly resistant factors for China export, vegetables and fruits export was sensitive {{to the number of}} regulated pesticides, the strictness, and the level of food <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> imposed by importing countries, which showed a significant trade flow effect, stricter food <b>safety</b> <b>standards,</b> increased number of regulated pesticides significantly inhibit China export of vegetables and fruits.

500|$|The Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism issued {{guidelines}} for hybrid and other near-silent vehicles in January 2010. In the United States the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010 {{was approved by}} the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives in December 2010. The act does not stipulate a specific speed for the simulated noise but requires the U.S. Department of Transportation to study and establish a motor vehicle <b>safety</b> <b>standard</b> that would set requirements for an alert sound. A proposed rule was published for comment by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in January, 2013. It would require hybrids and electric vehicles traveling at less than [...] to emit warning sounds that pedestrians must be able to hear over background noises. According to the NHTSA proposal carmakers would be able to pick the sounds the vehicles make from a range of choices, and similar vehicles would have to make the same sounds. The rules were scheduled to go into effect in September 2014. However, in January 2015 the NHTSA rescheduled the date for a final ruling to the end of 2015. Since the regulation comes into force three years after being rendered as a final rule, compliance was delayed to 2018.|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} the Pinto fuel system was {{complicated}} by the uncertain regulatory environment during the development period. [...] The first federal standard for automotive fuel system safety, passed in 1967, known as Section 301 in the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, initially only considered front impacts. [...] In January 1969, 18 months into the Pinto's development cycle, the NHTSA proposed expanding the standard to cover rear-end collisions. [...] The proposed standard {{was based on a}} 20mph moving-barrier rear impact test. Ford publicly announced it supported the standard. In August 1970, the month the Pinto went into production, the NHTSA changed the proposal to a more stringent 20mph fixed-barrier standard which car companies were to meet in 18 months. The fixed-barrier standard was seen by the auto industry as a significant increase in test severity. At the same time the NHTSA announced a long-term goal of setting a 30-mph fixed-barrier standard. [...] Due to the confusion related to the various proposed standards and an expectation that the NHTSA would not select the more stringent 30mph fixed-barrier standard, Ford elected to voluntarily meet the 20mph moving-barrier standard for all cars by 1973. [...] Ford and other automobile manufacturers objected to the more stringent fuel system <b>safety</b> <b>standard</b> and filed objections during the required comment periods of the proposed regulations.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} food <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> on processed food exports in developing countries. A panel data econometric analysis of processed food exports in developing countries was undertaken. The Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standard (SPS) is incorporated into the model to capture the impact of food <b>safety</b> <b>standards.</b> The empirical model shows that food <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> imposed by developed countries could impede processed food exports from developing countries. This could emerge because practically, SPS is less transparent than tariffs or quotas. There is an ample room for developed countries to tweak the standards stronger than necessary to achieve optimal levels of social protection, and to twist the related testing and certification procedures to make their competing imports more competitive. In addition, limited supply-side capacity of developing countries, {{especially in terms of}} resources, manpower as well as institution, constrains the countries to overcome food <b>safety</b> <b>standards.</b> Because of the potential benefits that could emerge from imposing food <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> such as a reduction in transaction costs and trade friction, developing countries should view SPS not just as a trade barrier but also as an opportunity to upgrade quality standard and market sophistication. Supply-side capacity in developing countries needed to be improved, especially upgrading agriculture sector. Multilateral efforts are also needed to mobilize additional financial and technical assistance to help redress constraints in developing countries in meeting the required food <b>safety</b> <b>standards</b> imposed by developed countries.
