25|$|Newton's method {{requires}} that the derivative be calculated directly. An analytical expression for the derivative may not be easily obtainable and could be expensive to evaluate. In these situations, it may be appropriate to approximate the derivative by using the slope of a line through two nearby points on the function. Using this approximation would result in <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> secant method whose convergence is slower than that of Newton's method.|$|E
25|$|Early on, Williamson became {{impressed}} by the works of Miles J. Breuer and struck up a correspondence with him. A doctor who wrote science fiction in his spare time, Breuer had a strong talent and turned Williamson away from dreamlike fantasies towards more rigorous plotting and stronger narrative. Under Breuer's tutelage, Williamson would send outlines and drafts for review. Their first work together was the novel Birth of a New Republic in which Moon colonies were undergoing <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> American Revolution—a theme later taken up by many other SF writers, particularly in Robert A. Heinlein's The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress.|$|E

25|$|As just suggested, the {{phenomena}} that c-command {{is intended to}} address may be more plausibly examined in terms of linear order and a hierarchy of syntactic functions. Concerning the latter, some theories of syntax take a hierarchy of syntactic functions to be primitive. This is true of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG), and dependency grammars (DGs). The hierarchy of syntactic functions that these frameworks posit is usually <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> following: SUBJECT > FIRST OBJECT > SECOND OBJECT > OBLIQUE OBJECT. Numerous mechanisms of syntax are then addressed {{in terms of this}} hierarchy.|$|E
25|$|By the way, {{would you}} convey my {{compliments}} to the purist who reads your proofs {{and tell him}} or her that I write {{in a sort of}} broken-down patois which is <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> way a Swiss-waiter talks, and that when I split an infinitive, God damn it, I split it so it will remain split, and when I interrupt the velvety smoothness of my more or less literate syntax with a few sudden words of barroom vernacular, this is done with the eyes wide open and the mind relaxed and attentive. The method may not be perfect, but it is all I have.|$|E
25|$|In early 2010, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} led by Zhang Fucheng examined fossils with preserved melanosomes (organelles which contain colors). By studying such fossils with an electron microscope, they found melanosomes preserved in a fossil Confuciusornis specimen, IVPP V13171. They reported the presence of melanosomes were of two types: eumelanosomes and pheomelanosomes. This indicated that Confuciusornis had hues of grey, red/brown and black, possibly <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> modern zebra finch. It was also the first time an early bird fossil has been shown to contain preserved pheomelanosomes. However, a second research team failed to find these reported traces of pheomelanosomes. Their 2011 study also found a link between the presence of certain metals, like copper, and preserved melanin. Using a combination of fossil impressions of melanosomes and the presence of metals in the feathers, the second team of scientists reconstructed Confuciusornis with darkly colored body feathers and upper wing feathers, but found no trace of either melanosomes or metals in the majority of the wing feathers. They suggested that the wings of Confuciusornis would have been white or, possibly, colored with carotenoid pigments. The long tail feathers of male specimens would have also been dark in color along their entire length.|$|E

500|$|Since Grohl {{felt the}} songs were {{different}} from the band's previous input and [...] "had {{the potential to be}} something great", he considered that instead of doing <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> last three albums, the band had to go out of [...] "our own comfort zone" [...] and [...] "needed someone to push us out of there". So Grohl decided to work again with Gil Norton, who produced the band's second album The Colour and the Shape, citing how Norton taught the band of the importance of pre-production and refining the composition, and claiming Norton's [...] "unconventional" [...] approach [...] "seems to capture the best of this band", considering that with him [...] "we're not going to do a straightforward AC/DC record, he's gonna make it different".|$|E

[...] "Murder to Excellence" [...] addresses black-on-black crime and limited social mobility for African Americans. Midway through the song the beat switches up, with Kanye musing over {{the horrors of}} black-on-black violence in the first half, and Jay-Z delivering equally meditated comments on black excellence on the more choir heavy second half.

[...] His concepts, moreover, are too individualized and dependent on context to give rise to a particular school of design. Pei refers to his own [...] "analytical approach" [...] when explaining the lack of a [...] "Pei School". [...] "For me," [...] he said, [...] "the important distinction is between a stylistic approach to the design; and an analytical approach giving the process of due consideration to time, place, and purpose... My analytical approach requires a full understanding of the three essential elements... to arrive at an ideal balance among them." ...|$|E
500|$|During this period, it {{was common}} for dancers to carry tap shoes with them and, when they {{encountered}} another dancer on the street, throw down their shoes by way of challenge. The culture of street dancing in the 1920s {{has been compared to}} the rise of break dancing six decades later. As the journal Jump Cut described it, [...] "'challenge dancing,' in which each performer tries to outdo the other, is part of tap dancing's heritage, <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> jazz solos in which musicians try to outshine one another." [...] Sims later described how the atmosphere of these dance challenges was at least as much collegial as combative, and how dancers learned from one another in what became essentially [...] "open air dance schools". Despite performing at various vaudeville venues, Sims found neither fame nor success as a dancer in Los Angeles. In 1947, he tagged along on one of his professional-boxer friend Archie Moore's cross-country drives, and settled in New York City.|$|E

The results are jaw dropping." [...] He also compared it {{to the work of}} The Weeknd and commended its [...] "lack of smut" [...] in the lyrics, stating [...] "it's just Usher playing it fast and loose in falsetto. The result is as subtle as it is unbelievable." [...] Eric Arredondo of Beats Per Minute viewed the song as an improvement over Usher's 2010 album Raymond v. Raymond and addressed the comparisons to The Weeknd, writing that, [...] "though it still doesn't hold much of the innovations and risks of <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>The</b> Weeknd's House of Balloons, 'Climax' can do something that most songs on that album can't do without losing most of their fun: be played on the radio." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 1977, Marquee Moon {{was voted}} the third best {{album of the year}} in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, {{published}} in The Village Voice. Christgau, the poll's creator and supervisor, ranked it number one on his own list. Sounds also named it the year's best album, while NME ranked it fifth on its year-end list. Verlaine later said of the overwhelmingly positive response from critics, [...] "There was a certain magic happening, an inexplicable certainty of <b>something,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> momentum of a freight train. That's not egoism but, if you cast a spell, you don't get flummoxed by the results of your spell." [...] By the time of Television's return to the US, however, Elektra had given up on promoting Marquee Moon, which they dismissed as a commercial failure. Marquee Moon sold fewer than 80,000 copies in the US and failed to chart on the Billboard 200. The group was dispirited by their inability to meet commercial expectations, which led to their disbandment in 1978.|$|E
500|$|The first {{recording}} of L'Orfeo was issued in 1939, a freely adapted version of Monteverdi's music by Giacomo Benvenuti, {{given by the}} orchestra of La Scala Milan conducted by Ferrucio Calusio. In 1949, for the {{recording of}} the complete opera by the Berlin Radio Orchestra under Helmut Koch, the new medium of long-playing records (LPs) was used. The advent of LP recordings was, as Harold C. Schonberg later wrote, {{an important factor in}} the postwar revival of interest in Renaissance and Baroque music, and from the mid-1950s recordings of L'Orfeo have been issued on many labels. The 1969 recording by Nikolaus Harnoncourt and the Vienna Concentus Musicus, using Harnoncourt's edition based on period instruments, was praised for [...] "making Monteverdi's music sound <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> way he imagined". In 1981 Siegfried Heinrich, with the Early Music Studio of the Hesse Chamber Orchestra, recorded a version which re-created the original Striggio libretto ending, adding music from Monteverdi's 1616 ballet Tirsi e Clori for the Bacchante scenes. Among more recent recordings, that of Emmanuelle Haïm in 2004 has been praised for its dramatic effect.|$|E
