40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} spatial distributions of <b>small</b> <b>mammal</b> species which act as intermediate host vectors for the parasitic tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis which causes a significant burden of human disease in western China. <b>Small</b> <b>mammal</b> distributions are modelled {{in relation to}} landscape characteristics derived from Landsat TM and ETM+ datasets. Statistical models are used to identify the landscape variables influencing <b>small</b> <b>mammal</b> spatial distributions, and to describe {{the nature of these}} relationships. They are then used predictively to determine probable <b>small</b> <b>mammal</b> distributions over large areas. Assessment of landscape change over a twenty-four year period, and its impact on <b>small</b> <b>mammal</b> communities are modelled. Results indicate that Ochotona distributions are significantly related to the spatial distribution of the degraded grassland habitat. Long-term landscape change analysis showed that large scale landscape degradation has occurred at the Serxu site between 1977 and 2001, increasing the area of degraded grassland, and the probability of <b>small</b> <b>mammal</b> presence. Probability maps of <b>small</b> <b>mammal</b> distributions are produced, with potentially significant applications in the development of future disease control programme...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Monthly {{fluctuations}} in the diet of Barn owl Tyto alba were compared to prey availability in a typical South African dry sandy highveld grassland over a 12 month period. Mice, shrews, bats, birds and insects were all major prey items, and their contribution in pellets fluctuated significantly over months. Barn owl proved to be very efficient samplers of the <b>small</b> <b>mammal</b> prey group: {{not only was the}} owl more successful than museum personnel in sampling the variety of species present during a specific time of year, but peaks in prey utilization were also more characteristic of actual fluctuations than that found by traps. Owl pellet analysis is a valuable asset during <b>small</b> <b>mammal</b> monitoring studies, and is especially useful for sampling <b>small</b> <b>mammal</b> indicator species during environ-mental impact assessments. However, owl pellet analysis should never be seen as an alternative for <b>small</b> <b>mammal</b> trapping when <b>small</b> <b>mammal</b> community structure is the focus of study.

5|$|Red pandas are {{excellent}} climbers, and forage largely in trees. They eat mostly bamboo, and may eat <b>small</b> <b>mammals,</b> birds, eggs, flowers, and berries.

5|$|A common {{assumption}} in mammalogy is that <b>small</b> <b>mammals</b> cannot subsist {{entirely on}} plant material {{and must have}} a high-calorie diet in order to survive. As a result, {{it was thought that}} the diet of tiny primates must be high in protein-containing insects (insectivory). Research has shown, however, that mouse lemurs, the smallest living primates, consume more fruit than insects, contradicting the popular hypothesis.|$|E

It is a large species in the pika family, Ochotonidae, which consists of <b>small</b> <b>mammals</b> that have short ears, forelimbs very slightly longer than hindlimbs, and no external tail. There are four recognised subspecies: O. a. alpina (Pallas, 1773), O. a. cinereofusca (Schrenk, 1858), O. a. sushkini (Thomas, 1924), and O. a. changaica (Ognev, 1940).|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relations between}} environmental features (biotic and abiotic) and <b>small</b> <b>mammal</b> communities in the Groendal Wilderness Area, South Africa.

The mechanisms for these relationships are complex, probably involving physiological, social and anti-predator effects as well as reflecting nutritional resources. Furthermore, man and fire influence <b>small</b> <b>mammal</b> community structure. These effects are as a result of altered plant community composition and structure by plantation and pasture establishment and burning.

30|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{assessing}} {{the diversity of the}} <b>small</b> <b>mammal</b> assemblage in ipucas and the zoogeographical patterns of this assemblage when compared to 30 additional study sites in Brazil.
