For example, a smaller 4-wheel and halftrack sand cleaning machine is used for sandpits in Kindergarten and municipality playing fields and for beach volleyball.When environmental or spot-cleaning requires hand operations, an auto-sifting, lightweight, <b>screened</b> <b>rake</b> can be the best choice ...|$|R
50|$|Halloween: Resurrection was {{released}} on July 12, 2002 in the US to moderate reception which did not change in its later international release. The film peaked at #4 on its opening weekend on US <b>screens</b> <b>raking</b> in $12,292,121 behind Reign of Fire, Road to Perdition and Men in Black II. It grossed $30,354,442 domestically and a further $7,310,413 for a moderate $37,664,855 worldwide gross.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{structural}} design of hydraulic <b>raking</b> <b>screens</b> placed before a sewage treatment plant. The first part describes various possibilities of water treatment from individual particles. The second part deals with basic parameters of screens and calculations of propelling power for previously chosen structure. Furthermore, a strength check of structure under the most unfavourable load is performed. Drawings of the whole assembly of hydraulic <b>raking</b> <b>screens,</b> plus a few selected components {{are attached to the}} thesis...|$|R
50|$|To {{begin the}} {{treatment}} of the water, a sample is first taken from the water in order to measure its strength. This is accomplished by measuring the biological oxygen demand of the water. This water is then sent through a series of <b>screens</b> that <b>rake</b> out large solids such as wood and plastic.|$|R
50|$|Combined raking and sifting technologydiffers from pure sifters {{in that it}} uses {{rotating}} tines {{to scoop}} sand and debris onto a vibrating screen instead of relying simply on the pick-up blade. The tines' position can be adjusted to more effectively guide different-sized materials onto the screen. Once on the <b>screen,</b> combined <b>raking</b> and sifting machines use the same technology as normal sifters to remove unwanted debris from the sand.|$|R

The streamlined design of the car was seen as quite radical , its most distinctive features being its large front grille and the steeply <b>raked</b> <b>screen</b> pillars.|$|R

This paper contains structural optimalization of the structure due to operating conditions and loads, mechanical strength calculations and drawings of the device and its details...|$|R
40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{construction}} design mechanically <b>rake</b> <b>screens</b> with hydraulic drive. The diploma thesis is composet of several parts, {{in a first}} past is an overwiew of mechanical method of cleaning screams. The second part deals of diploma thesis deals with product design rakes raking mechanism. The third part is an analysis of machine parts and describe their functions. It is then carried out stress analysis using fine element methods (FEM) in the program I-deas...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{construction}} concept of mechanical <b>rake</b> <b>screen</b> {{and consists of}} several main sections. The first section of the diploma thesis covers {{an overview of the}} current supply of mechanically scraping rack. In the second section, basic parameters and calculations are solved for the mechanical rack construction concept. In the third one however, analysis of the construction is realized with SolidWorks modeller and the functions of particular parts of the rack is explained. The last section of the diploma thesis focuses on stress control using classic calculation methods and Finite Element Methods (FEM) using a program called I-DEAS...|$|R
5000|$|Only two Pinocchios were built. The {{first had}} a [...] {{converted}} Volkswagen 1.1 L litre engine. The second, built by Pierre Bordini, was originally designated the CP-210 and was {{powered by a}} [...] Salmson 9 AD engine. In July 1961 it became the CP-211, with the same Salmson engine but with a one-piece sliding canopy and more <b>raked</b> <b>screen,</b> faired landing legs and a tailwheel rather than a skid, greater fuel capacity, and a cropped vertical tail. Its time as the CP-211 was brief, for {{at the end of}} 1961 it became the CP-212, fitted with a [...] Continental A-65 air-cooled flat-four engine.|$|R
