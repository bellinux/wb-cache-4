40|$|As an {{amorphous}} material with full inversion symmetry, silica-based microstructures cannot possess significant second-order nonlinearity. We recently developed {{a method that}} can potentially overcome this deficiency by coating a silica fiber taper with layers of radially aligned nonlinear molecules. The coating process can be accomplished through layer-by-layer self-assembly, where the alignment of the nonlinear molecules is maintained through electrostatic interaction. As a result, the nonlinear fiber structures are thermodynamically stable and can generate significant second-order nonlinear responses despite their full rotational symmetry. This prediction has been experimentally confirmed through SHG measurements. To further enhance the overall second-order nonlinearity, we have developed an UV-ablation-based approach that can generate second-order nonlinearity that is spatially periodic along the fiber taper. Our preliminary experiments suggest that SHG intensity can be enhanced by such quasi-phase-matching configurations. We can also use the self-assembly approach to construct tunable plasmonic systems. As a proof-of-concept study, we assembled <b>swellable</b> polymer films over a planar Au substrate through layer-by-layer assembly and covered the <b>swellable</b> polymer with a monolayer of quantum dots.

40|$|PURPOSE: This {{study is}} to design a {{sustained}} release solid dispersion using <b>swellable</b> polymer by melting method. METHODS: Polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 4000 (HPMC 4000) were used in solid dispersion for not only enhancing drug dissolution rate but also sustaining drug release. HPMC 4000 is a common <b>swellable</b> polymer in matrix sustained release dosage form, but {{could not be used}} in preparation of solid dispersion by melting method. However, the current study utilized the swelling capability of HPMC 4000 accompanied by the common carrier PEG 6000 in solid dispersion to accomplish the goal. RESULTS: While PEG 6000 acted as a releasing stimulant carrier and provided an environment to facilitate the swelling of HPMC 4000, this <b>swellable</b> polymer could act as a rate-controlling agent. This greatly assisted the dissolution enhancement by changing the crystalline structure of drug to more amorphous form and creating a molecular interaction.

30|$|To {{identify}} {{the cause of}} damage, the LGRB made several exploration drillings. Similar {{to the case of}} Staufen, inflow of groundwater into an anhydrite-bearing layer had caused the uplifts. The <b>swellable</b> anhydrite layers were located in the Grabfeld formation at a depth of 56 – 114  m below ground level (Fig.  4). Geothermal drillings reached their final depth in the impermeable Erfurt formation. Hence, upward migration of the underlying confined groundwater of the Upper Muschelkalk was excluded just as in the city of Staufen. Temperature profiles confirmed a descending groundwater flow from the Stuttgart formation into the anhydrite-bearing layers of the Grabfeld formation. Groundwater from the Stuttgart formation found its way through a leaky backfilling.

40|$|Abstract 0 A <b>swellable</b> matrix tablet is {{described}} which is partially coated with cellulose acetate (CA) {{to obtain a}} film having {{the shape of a}} cup, whose permeability to water and solutes was altered by mixing increasing amounts of poly(ethylene glycol) 400 (PEG). The drug-release mechanism from such systems was assessed by carrying out drug-release experiments both in water and saline solutions. Drug permeability through the polymeric cup and SEM analysis on the films were also performed. It was found that the systems exhibited drugrelease kinetics very close to linearity. The mechanisms governing drug release were (i) drug diffusion through the uncoated gel layer, (ii) drug transport through the gel layer due to the osmotic pressure difference, and (iii) drug diffusion through the cup pores. The relative importance of each contribution depended on the amount of PEG in the film. The systems with a cup containing 1 %, 13 %, and 33 % PEG w/w behaved in part as osmotic systems, whereas the system having a permeable cup behaved as a hybrid reservoir system. These modifications of the coating permeability introduce a further possibility of modulating drug-release kinetics and lead to a reduced dependence of <b>swellable</b> matrix tablet release on environmental conditions...|$|E

Two modules differently shaped, i. e., female and male, formulated as <b>swellable</b> matrices and containing clindamycin, were assembled by friction interlocking. Then, by stacking additional female modules without drug on the assembled two-module floating system, modulation of clindamycin release rate and kinetics was attained. The additional modules stacked on the assembled system acted as a transient barrier to clindamycin release from the void configuration. Inertness, dissolution/erosion or swelling behavior characterized their performance as matrices in simulated gastric fluid. In particular, we found that stacking additional barrier modules on the bases of void configuration, the drug release rate and kinetics of the assembled system were modified in dependence on the composition of module added. In particular, the quickly soluble module exerted an influence on the release rate in the late time of delivery.
