40|$|Editor’s {{key points}} † In this meta-analysis, {{the authors have}} looked for {{evidence}} of effective strategy for intraoperative ventilation in obese patients. † Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria for analysis on the mode of ventilation or recruitment manoeuvres (RM). † No difference in the outcomes was seen on comparing pressure-controlled and volume-controlled modes of ventilation. † Importantly, RM with PEEP maintained better intraoperative oxygenation and lung compliance compared with PEEP alone. Background. Pathophysiological changes due to obesity may complicate mechanical ventilation during general anaesthesia. The ideal ventilation strategy is expected to optimize gas exchange and pulmonary mechanics and {{to reduce the risk}} of respiratory complications. Methods. <b>Systematic</b> search (databases, <b>bibliographies,</b> to March 2012, all languages) was performed for randomized trials testing intraoperative ventilation strategies in obese patients (BMI ≥ 30 kg m 22), and reporting on gas exchange, pulmonary mechanics, or pulmonary complications.

40|$|Remote {{monitoring}} {{for heart}} failure has been evaluated in numerous systematic reviews. The {{aim of this}} meta-review was to appraise their quality and synthesise results. We electronically searched online databases, performed a forward citation search and hand-searched <b>bibliographies.</b> <b>Systematic</b> reviews of remote monitoring interventions that were used for surveillance of heart failure patients were included. Seven (41 %) systematic reviews pooled results for meta-analysis. Eight (47 %) considered all non-invasive remote monitoring strategies. Five (29 %) focused on telemonitoring. Four (24 %) included both non-invasive and invasive technologies. According to AMSTAR criteria, ten (58 %) systematic reviews were of poor methodological quality. In high quality reviews, the relative risk of mortality in patients who received remote monitoring ranged from 0. 53 (95 % CI= 0. 29 - 0. 96) to 0. 88 (95 % CI= 0. 76 - 1. 01). High quality reviews also reported that remote monitoring reduced the relative risk of all-cause (0. 52; 95 % CI= 0. 28 - 0. 96 to 0. 96; 95 % CI= 0. 90 – 1. 03) and heart failure-related hospitalizations (0. 72; 95 % CI= 0. 64 – 0. 81 to RR 0. 79; 95 % CI= 0. 67 - 0. 94) and, as a consequence, healthcare costs.

40|$|Purpose The {{needs and}} {{concerns}} of patients with advanced breast cancer are changing at every phase of the care intervention. Management and coordination of hospital resources and services are also steadily evolving. The objective of the present expert report is to define a new oncology nursing role specialising in advanced breast cancer, to help guide patients throughout the whole healthcare itinerary. Methods A group of eight experts in oncology nursing and medical oncology defined the content index of the curriculum document. A <b>systematic</b> review of <b>bibliography</b> was carried out, and the relevant contents were extracted. Based on these contents and the participants’ experience recommendations were formulated and validated through a Delphi questionnaire and a participative meeting. Results The advanced breast cancer clinical nurse (ABCCN) should develop a clinical, psychosocial role focused on coordinating patients in the healthcare network. The nurse would {{be in charge of}} evaluating and supervising the care administered and the healthcare resources used. The ABCCN should be aware and participate in the protocols and available resources, be able to solve conflicts, deal with burn-out signs and have clinical, coaching and team-working abilities. The proposed curriculum provides a specific process for the care of patients, as well as an implementation process. Conclusions The ABCCN’s role is crucial to assume the best care and the optimisation of available resources. This review and consensus document provides the required tools for the implementation in hospitalsThe development of this work has been possible thanks to the financial support of Novartis Oncolog...|$|R

Associations between predictive factors and AMS incidence were sought through bivariate and multivariate analyses for different study designs separately. Association between AMS incidence and study design was assessed using multiple linear regression. RESULTS: We extracted data from 53, 603 subjects from 34 randomized controlled trials, 44 cohort studies, and 33 cross-sectional studies. In randomized trials, the median of AMS incidences without prophylaxis was 60 % (range, 16 %- 100 %); mode of ascent and population were significantly associated with AMS incidence. In cohort studies, the median of AMS incidences was 51 % (0 %- 100 %); geographical location was significantly associated with AMS incidence. In cross-sectional studies, the median of AMS incidences was 32 % (0 %- 68 %); mode of ascent and maximum altitude were significantly associated with AMS incidence. In a multivariate analysis, study design (p= 0. 012), mode of ascent (p= 0. 003), maximum altitude (p< 0. 001), population (p= 0. 002), and geographical location (p< 0. 001) were significantly associated with AMS incidence. Age, sex, speed of ascent, duration of exposure, or history of AMS were inconsistently reported and therefore not further analyzed.

Worldwide, more than 90 % of the plants listed in conservation categories are endemic to one country. In Chile, 45 % of the flora is endemic, currently considering 83 endemic genera and 4 endemic families, elevated numbers compared to the rest of Latinamerica. However, the high rate of changes in taxonomy, based on studies of molecular systematics has produced modifications in this list. This study aims at discussing such modifications and in this way, contribute to the correct delimitation of our endemic genera.

40|$|The {{association}} between the degree of neurological deficit and cardiopulmonary dysfunction in patients with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is poorly understood. Method: A <b>systematic</b> search (MEDLINE, <b>bibliographies,</b> to 9. 2004) was performed for prospective studies (any architecture; = 10 patients with SAH), reporting on neurological deficit and cardiopulmonary dysfunction. Neurological deficit was graded according to the Hunt-Hess or Botterell scores as minimal (1 or 2 points), moderate (3), or severe (4 or 5), and tested for an association with cardiopulmonary dysfunction (chisquare test). Results: Relevant data came from two randomized trials, four case-control studies, and 31 uncontrolled series. In eight studies (386 patients), ECG abnormalities were found in 32 % of patients with minimal, 55 % with moderate, and 58 % with severe neurological deficit (P< 0. 0001). In six studies (135), echocardiographic abnormalities were found in 4 % of patients with minimal, 30 % with moderate, and 52 % with severe neurological deficit (P= 0. 0001). In two trials (63), reatinine phosphoskinase was increased in 18 % of patients with minimal, 71 % with moderate, and 100 % with severe neurological deficit (P< 0. 0001). In three trials (309), troponin-I was increased in 10 % of patients with minimal, 20 % of patients with moderate, and 46 % with severe neurological deficit (P< 0. 0001). In five trials (163), pulmonary edema was found in 4 % of patients with minimal, 12 % with moderate, and 35 % with severe neurological deficit (P< 0. 0001). Seventeen studies reported on mortality; 26 % of the patients died, 80 % of deaths were directly related to SAH.

40|$|The {{production}} of an emulsion by emulsification plant without {{the addition of}} chemical additives always requires an injection device of the dispersed phase (water or ethanol) into the continuous phase (fuel oil). In this way a preliminary mixture of immiscible liquids is produced at the right volume ratio. Such a mixture is processed downstream to have an emulsion with the dispersed phase drop mean diameters less than 4 μm. Since Gas Turbines have a variable fuel flow related to the delivered power, there is the necessity of maintaining a prescribed dispersed phase to continuous phase volumetric ratio when the fuel flow varies. This paper deals with an automatic device {{that is capable of}} producing the prescribed injection ratio of the dispersed phase into the fuel oil when the fuel oil flow rate changes. Such a device is developed to be coupled with an emulsification system that provides to break an immiscible part of fluid in a very small drops. The system is for feeding fuel into engines (S. I. Gasoline, Diesel, Gas Turbine combustors) operating at variable loadings i. e variable liquid fuel flow. The mixer (PMD, Pre-Mixer Device) has been presented at ASME Turbo Expo (Montreal 2007) for diesel # 2 operating at 25 °C with the viscosity being assumed as constant because of its variation is in a reduced range. In this paper, different fuels having different viscosities (diesel oil of different numbers, rapeseed oil, sunflower oil, etc) have been tested. The major modeling aspect concerns with the behavior of the annular orifice that produces a membrane displacement. A bibliographic analysis has been performed and the main results are reported in this paper. Since the architecture of the orifice, its geometry and the flow conditions were not reported in the <b>bibliography,</b> <b>systematic</b> experiments have been performed. Such experiments where carried on for various liquids having various viscosities for different geometric arrangements and force acting on the membrane. The analysis of results led to formulate models to describe both the flow discharge and effective force coefficients. The paper gives a complete outlook of the experiments and of the above models. The viscosity dependent models have been introduced in to the PMD simulation code. Such models that take the influence of viscosity into account have been developed and some scale-up rules have been established. An amply description of the sizing and scale-up models are presented together with modification to improve the prototype behavior operated with fluids having different viscosities. Experimental results concerning the influence of viscosity of the continuous phase are presented and widely discussed taking the model as reference...|$|R
