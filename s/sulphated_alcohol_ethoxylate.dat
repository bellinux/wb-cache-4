The animals were killed at 48 hr, the area of treated skin excised and the carcass analysed for residual radioactivity.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis involves the application of mass spectrometry {{to the analysis of}} a number of both commercial products and model organic compounds. Use of soft ionisation techniques for thermally labile and ionic compounds (mainly fast atom bombardment, field desorption and thermospray) has been extensively explored for the provision of both qualitative and quantitative information. More established ionisation techniques (electron impact and chemical ionisation) have also been utilized in order to obtain qualitative data. In many cases comparisons have been made between different ionisation modes, and some discussion of the processes occuring is given. Ion structures and decomposition pathways have been elucidated by both tandem mass spectrometry and high mass resolution measurements. Analysis of both complex mixtures and pure compounds has been performed.

40|$|Waxes {{have many}} {{potential}} uses but large-scale application is hampered by their virtual insolubility. By grafting the wax with a polyethylene glycol segment {{to form an}} <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylate,</b> the solubility of the wax in commercial solvents is significantly increased. <b>Alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> are produced by the polymerisation addition of ethylene oxide onto an oxidised wax. Current methods of <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylate</b> production from <b>alcohols</b> lead to wide ethylene oxide addition distribution and large quantities of residual alcohol. The objective {{of this study is}} to provide a method for narrowing the ethylene oxide distribution and to reduce the residual alcohol content. It is proposed to concentrate the <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylate</b> in a post-production separation process using supercritical fluid extraction. The system is modelled to contain three pseudo-components: an alkane, an alcohol and an <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylate.</b> Propane is selected as the supercritical solvent of choice due to the large solubility difference between the alkane and polyethylene glycol. Lower molecular weight alkane phase equilibrium data with propane is abundant but extrapolation to higher molecular weights requires further investigation as it may be complicated by molecular folding. Molecular folding occurs in crystalline polyethylene and high molecular weight normal alkanes but information regarding molecular folding in solution is inconclusive. A model is proposed for molecular folding of normal alkanes in supercritical solution. A high molecular weight alkane mixture is synthesised and phase equilibrium measurement with propane are conducted. A lower molecular weight alkane mixture is used to prove the application of the principle of congruency to high-pressure phase equilibria. In the high wax mass fraction region the measurements are between the no-folding and once-folded relationship, indicating the possibility of partial molecular folding. In the mixture critical and low wax mass fraction region the measurements are similar to the non-folding relationship. Molecular folding in solution is thus dependent on the solution concentration. No phase equilibria measurements exist for propane with either high molecular weight <b>alcohols</b> or <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylates.</b> Measurements of propane with an alcohol mixture show total solubility below 140 barA for temperatures up to 408 K. Measurements of propane with an <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylate</b> at temperatures between 378 and 408 K shows that for an <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylate</b> mass fraction between 0. 025 and 0. 5 pressures greater than 275 barA are required for solubilisation. When comparing the solubility of the three pseudo-components, the alkane is the most soluble followed by the <b>alcohol.</b> The <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylate</b> is the least soluble. A counter-current supercritical extraction process is proposed for the concentration of the <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylate.</b> Pilot plant tests were conducted and the proposed set-up shows good separation. An estimate of the energy requirements shows that heating and cooling constitute the majority of the energy required but with the use of heat integration it can be reduced by approximately 33 %. This work thus shows that the proposed process is both technically and economically viable. Although this work has provided a method for concentrating the <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylate,</b> the process has not been optimised yet and future work includes the fine-tuning of this process...|$|R
40|$|Currently <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> {{produced}} {{contain a}} wide {{distribution of the}} number of ethylene oxide units added. One possible method to reduce the wide distribution is with the use of supercritical fluids.

An analysis of the relative solubility was used to further show the large solubility difference and to assist in determining suitable operational parameters.

40|$|Liquid triglycerides, {{the major}} {{component}} of cooking oils, have been found difficult to remove from synthetic fabrics during washing. The relatively strong adhesion force between triglycerides and fabric and their high molecular volumes make detergency mechanisms which work well for other soils and cotton fabrics relatively ineffective with surfactants commonly used in washing products. It is likely that a process for effective triglyceride removal would involve a solubilization-emulsification mechanism. Intermediate phases such as microemulsions or liquid crystals form at the surface of contact between surfactant solution and soil. These intermediate phases solubilize the soil and are subsequently emulsified into the washing bath. Because secondary <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylate</b> surfactants have double tails of varying lengths, the hydrocarbon portion of surfactant films should be more disordered than for linear <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> used in previous work and hence more capable of solubilizing triglyceride molecules. Equilibrium phase behavior of systems containing water, triolein, and secondary <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> showed that a D or microemulsion phase which solubilized significant amounts of triolein formed at temperatures as low as 25 ∘C. In previous work with pure linear <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> and triolein the D phase had formed only at temperatures above about 55 ∘C, which are undesirably high for washing synthetic fabrics. Based on the earlier studies, formation of the D phase {{would be expected to}} promote soil removal from synthetic fabrics by a solubilization-emulsification mechanism. Even for a rather hydrophilic secondary <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylate</b> surfactant, slightly below its cloud point, solubilization rate and capacity are much greater than those for comparable linear ethoxylates, and complete solubilization of oils rich in triolein is possible. Liquid triglycerides typically occur as mixtures with long chain polar compounds such as alcohols or fatty acids. Contacting experiments for alcohol-rich oils revealed a mechanism involving spontaneous emulsification which provides a means for soil removal different from that found previously in other systems. Newly developed fiber contacting experiments with drops initially attached to individual polyester fibers confirmed that little oil remained on the fibers when the emulsification was extensive...|$|R

30|$|The {{spread of}} {{droplets}} on a leaf surface {{is a measure}} of how well a spray can be expected to cover the plant surface following droplet adhesion. Pinus radiata foliage is classified as easy-to-wet, with a surface contact angle of 64 º (Gaskin et al. [2005]). Surfactants are most useful for improving droplet spread and adhesion on difficult-to-wet species (Gaskin et al. [2005]). The effect of adjuvants on droplet spread on easy-to-wet foliage confirmed this (Table  1). Although significant, pinolene increased the spread of phosphorous acid spray droplets negligibly. <b>Alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylate</b> improved droplet spread and the effect increased with increasing concentration (Table  1).

40|$|Highly {{amphiphilic}} polyalkane-PEO diblock copolymers drastically {{increase the}} solubilization capacity of surfactants in microemulsions {{if they are}} used in small quantities as additive to the surfactant. This effect goes along with an additional reduction of the already very low interfacial tension between water and oil. Lamellar phases, which usually develop when the surfactant becomes more efficient, are suppressed to a large extent. In this work we use another type of additive, namely hydrophilic <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylates.</b> These amphiphiles are identical with the previously used block copolymers {{with respect to the}} hydrophilic moiety. However, they contain only small hydrocarbon groups ranging from C 8 to C 18. A typical example from the hydrophilic <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> is C 12 E 100. Both additive types increase surfactant efficiency equally with respect to mass fraction in the mixture. Because the <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylate</b> additives decorate the surfactant film only on the aqueous side, they influence the curvature of the surfactant membrane or, in other words, the temperature behavior of the microemulsion. Together with nonionic surfactants, however, the shift of the one-phase region to higher temperatures is only a few degrees Celsius. Just as with the polyalkane-PEO block copolymers, the hydrophilic <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> suppress lamellar phases. This behavior is especially pronounced if the hydrophobic groups are small or the PEO chains are long. We found that hydrophobic units as short as C 8 are sufficient to largely anchor the PEO chains at the interface. If C 12 or C 18 hydrocarbon unit are used instead, the PEO chains are fully interfacially active, even if the hydrophilic chain contains up to about 500 EO units. We applied the new additives in bicontinuous and in droplet microemulsions and used nonionic, as well as ionic, surfactants, namely C 10 E 4 and AOT. In contrast to polyalkane-PEO blockcopolymers the new additives are easy to synthesize and are commercially available. Therefore, they might be interesting in applications...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} has been to explore the use of microemulsions as {{reaction}} media for organic synthesis. Another important aim has been to improve {{the understanding of the}} reaction kinetics and the mechanism of the reaction in this type of surfactant system. Three different types of reactions have been investigated in this work, which has been performed mainly with nonionic microemulsions. As expected, the reactions studied were much faster in a microemulsion compared to the same reactions performed in a corresponding two-phase system. Most reaction rates have been monitored by 1 H-NMR, but in one study UV spectroscopy was employed as method. It has been shown that the reactions proceed well in microemulsions based on nonionic surfactants; however, the reaction rate is very dependent on surfactant type. To be more specific, a large difference in reaction rate was found when performing a SN 2 reaction in a microemulsion based on an <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylate</b> compared with the same reaction in a very similar microemulsion based on a sugar surfactant. The high reactivity in microemulsions based on <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> is believed to be due to a favourable microenvironment in the reaction zone. However, it was shown that in both microemulsion types the reaction rate was almost independent of the choice of counterion to the attacking nucleophile.

The resulting dominant intermediate was identified by normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as a nonylphenol ethoxylate with 2 mol of EO units. A carboxylated metabolite, [(nonylphenoxy) ethoxy]acetic acid, was detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. This bacterium also metabolized <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> with various numbers of EO units but not polyethylene glycols whatever their degree of polymerization. By oxygen consumption assay, the alkyl group or arene corresponding to the hydrophobic part of <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> or alkylphenol ethoxylates was shown to contribute to the induction of the metabolic system of the EO chain of Triton N- 101, instead of the EO chain itself, which corresponds to its hydrophilic part. Thus, the isolated pseudomonad bacterium has unique substrate assimilability: it metabolizes the EO chain only when the chain linked to bulky hydrophobic groups...|$|R

40|$|Nonionic <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> {{are widely}} used as {{surfactants}} in many different applications. They are available in {{a large number of}} structural varieties as technical grade products. This variety is mainly based on the use of different alcohols, which can be linear or branched and contain primary, secondary, or tertiary OH groups. Technical grade products are poorly defined as they are composed of alcohol mixtures being different in chain length and structure. On the other hand, monodisperse <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> are commercially available; however, these surfactants exist only with primary and linear alcohols. In the field of microemulsion research the monodisperse <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> {{are widely used}}. The phase behavior and film properties of these surfactants were studied intensively with respect {{to the size of the}} hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties. Due to the lack of appropriate model surfactants until now, there is little information on how the structure of the hydrocarbon tail influences the microemulsion behavior. To examine structural influences, we synthesized a series of surfactants with the composition C 10 E 5 and having different linear and branched hydrocarbon tails. The surfactants were monodisperse with respect to the hydrocarbon tail but polydisperse with respect to the ethoxylation degree. However, a detailed characterization showed that they were similar concerning the average ethoxylation degree and EO chain length distribution. The phase behavior was investigated for bicontinuous microemulsions, and the film properties were analyzed by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Our results show that the structure of the hydrocarbon tail strongly influences the microemulsion behavior. The most efficient surfactant is obtained if the hydrocarbon tail is linear and the hydrophilic group is attached in the C- 1 position. Surfactants having the hydrophilic group bound to the C- 2 or C- 4 position or which contain a branched hydrocarbon tail are less efficient and exhibit in most cases visibly lower phase inversion temperatures. Both the efficiency and temperature behavior mainly can be explained on the basis of increased bulkiness of the branched structures compared to the fully linear version. The phase behavior results are largely confirmed by the SANS investigations. Those results show that the fully linear surfactant exhibits the most rigid interfacial film. In additional experiments this surfactant was compared with its monodisperse analogue. According to the phase diagrams, the surfactant having the polydisperse hydrophilic moiety is drastically more efficient although the film stiffnesses are almost identical...|$|R
40|$|The {{biodegradation}} of {{fatty alcohol}} polyglycol ethers was studied {{by analyzing the}} 14 C-labeled intermediates isolated from the effluent of a model continuous-flow sewage treatment plant after dosage of either alkyl- or heptaglycol-labeled stearyl <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylate</b> (SA- 7 EO). In each case, uncharged and carboxylated (mainly dicarboxylated) polyethylene glycols constituted the most prominent metabolites. The results indicate {{that there is a}} faster degradation of the alkyl than the polyethylene glycol moiety and that there are two distinct primary degradation mechanisms acting simultaneously in microbial biocenoses: intramolecular scission of the surfactant as well as omega- and beta-oxidation of the alkyl chain. Characterization of the bulk of 14 C-labeled metabolites as a homologous series of neutral and acidic polyglycol units and identification of several C 2 -fragments accounted for the depolymerization of the hydrophilic part of the surfactant by stepwise cleavage of ether-bound EO units; from additional degradation studies employing either neutral or carboxylated 14 C-labeled polyethylene glycols as model metabolites, it was concluded that hydrolytic as well as oxidative cleavage of C 2 -units is involved. Most of the identified low-molecular-weight 14 C-labeled acids suggest an ultimate degradation of EO monomers by the oxidative dicarbonic acid cycle or the glycerate pathway or both. In addition, the finding of considerable amounts of oxalic and formic acids allow consideration of an additional mineralization route via glyoxylic, oxalic, and formic acids. The simultaneous action of different degradation mechanisms indicates the involvement of several distinct bacterial groups in the biodegradation of fatty <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> under environmental conditions...|$|R
30|$|From {{the results}} obtained, {{which showed that}} there were no large {{differences}} in the percentage of demulsification between the crude extracts and the isolated biosurfactants, some considerations can be made. In an industrial application of demulsifiers, the proper balance between the cost of using a higher concentration to save time and equipment capacity and a lower concentration and cost of demulsifier, which will result in longer separation time and probably a higher investment in the capacity of equipment should be evaluated, as discussed by Hajivand and Vaziri (2015) who found that the lowest concentration of fatty <b>alcohol</b> <b>ethoxylate</b> gave 52 % separation, while the highest concentration of the demulsifier achieved 64 % separation.|$|R
