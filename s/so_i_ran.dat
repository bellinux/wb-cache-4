500|$|After {{the success}} of her debut single [...] "Locomotion" [...] in Australia, Minogue {{traveled}} to London to work with Stock Aitken Waterman, a successful British writing and production team. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote [...] "I Should Be So Lucky" [...] in forty minutes while she waited outside the recording studio. Mike Stock wrote the lyrics for the song in response {{to what he had}} learned about Minogue prior to her arrival. He believed that although she was a successful soap star in Australia, attractive and very talented, there had to be something wrong with her and figured that she must be unlucky in love. Minogue recorded the song in less than an hour, which Stock attributes to her good ear for music and her quick memorization skills. After Minogue finished the recording session she returned home to Australia to continue work on the soap opera, Neighbours. After hearing the song, Waterman said [...] "I thought it was fantastic, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> over to the DJ and asked him what it was. He said 'Its Kylie Minogue - I Should Be So Lucky'." [...] He later said to Mike Stock that the song would be an instant smash hit.|$|E
500|$|Tina fell in {{love for}} the first time with a boy named Harry. She spoke about this {{relationship}} in her 1986 interview with Rolling Stone. [...] "It was a basketball game – the school Harry attended was playing my school. I was just graduating from junior high. Well, I looked across the gym and saw Harry, and I {{fell in love}}. My heart was beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' I just had to have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And then he told Harry that I had asked who he was. And Harry looked up at me, and I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually I got him, and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I wish he had told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning I got on the bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying. At the end of the day, I cried it all out." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, {{he faced}} a {{challenger}} in the primary, attorney Greg Delev of Anderson Township. Brinkman told the Enquirer, [...] "I ran for office when the party wanted to dictate who my state representative {{was going to}} be. I couldn't stand for that, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran,</b> and I'm proud I did. It's been a frustrating three years as I've watched Governor Taft drive the state off a cliff. But I've been fighting back." [...] Delev said he agreed with Brinkman {{on most of the}} issues, but that Brinkman's actions in Columbus had made the district [...] "the laughingstock of the state." [...] The Cincinnati Enquirer said both candidates were [...] "rock-ribbed conservatives who agree on most fiscal and social issues," [...] but endorsed Delev. [...] "The issue here is Brinkman's lack of effectiveness," [...] said the newspaper, echoing the Columbus Monthly article: ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of World War I at the young age of 16, Brodovitch {{abandoned}} his dream of entering the Imperial Art Academy and {{ran away from home}} to join the Russian army. Not long after, his father had him brought home and hired a private tutor to help Alexey finish school. Upon graduating, Brodovitch ran away again on several occasions. He recalls: After a week or <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> away to the front line to kill Germans. But my father, now a military general {{at the head of a}} Red Cross hospital train, had plenty of influence, and I was soon brought back to him. On the train back I was employed as a nurses' aid. In East Prussia I ran away again and joined a nearby regiment. Once again I was caught, and this time I was sent to an officers' school, the Corps de Pages. During the Russian Civil War, Brodovitch served with the White Army. While fighting against the Bolsheviks in Odessa, he was badly wounded and was hospitalized for a time in Kislovodsk, in the Caucasus. [...] In 1918, the town was surrounded by the Bolsheviks, forcing Brodovitch into exile. It was during this retreat to the south through Caucasus and Turkey that he met his future wife, Nina.|$|E
2500|$|Zaid welcomed Abdullah's {{announcement}} {{in spite of}} the lack of a formal apology, saying: [...] "(One) can say sorry in other ways." [...] George Seah's son told the press that although all his father wanted was an apology, the family would not reject any goodwill payments. Tan Sri Wan Suleiman Pawanteh's wife said: [...] "Although I thank the prime minister, I feel less than satisfied at his decision (not to make a straightforward apology). This {{is not the end of}} the story for me. (Without an apology) I don't know, people don't know, that my husband was not guilty. I want my husband's name to be cleared. I feel my husband was innocent. He was an honest judge...Even so, I am thankful that our prime minister cares about us enough (to do this much)." [...] Tan Sri Eusoffe Abdoolcader's granddaughter regretted that acknowledgement had been so late in coming: [...] "I wish he was here. He's the main person affected by all this. It's a different case from the others (Salleh and Wan Suleiman) because he was reinstated. It's been 12 years. It should have been solved earlier." [...] Tun Salleh Abas however welcomed Abdullah's statement, saying: [...] "I feel great. It was something I didn't expect. I suffered so much humiliation ... so much <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> away from the public and took solace in being a farmer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{think she}} was crying; but I thought {{listening}} any more would be unfair, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> upstairs and threw up the drawing-room window to warn them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was <b>so</b> {{mad that}} <b>I</b> could have pushed her over an' broke the gate, but I {{thought that if}} there was {{anything}} of that kind to do I had a husband whose business it was to attend to it, an' <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>runs</b> aroun' to him to tell him. He had gone in, but I met Mrs. Jackson an' her brother.|$|R
60|$|ANNA--I {{should say}} not! The {{old man of}} the family, his wife, and four sons--I had to slave for all of 'em. I was only a poor relation, and they treated me worse than they dare treat a hired girl. [After a moment's hesitation--somberly.] It {{was one of the}} sons--the youngest--started me--when I was sixteen. After that, <b>I</b> hated 'em <b>so</b> I'd killed 'em all if I'd stayed. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> away--to St. Paul.|$|R

60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran,</b> Sir, as I {{had never}} run before; the beads of {{perspiration}} poured down from my forehead; the breath came stertorous and hot from my heaving breast.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a fib! I'm sorry I was out; but {{the house}} was gloomy and Aunt rather cross, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> away under pretence of giving old Tip an airing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{today he}} told me this, and left me to break with Lucia; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> to {{you to help me}} prevent him from disappointing his mother's hopes and plans." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, I suppose so," [...] {{answered}} King Rinkitink, with a laugh. [...] "But {{what else}} could I do? My subjects would not allow me to go anywhere at all, if they knew it. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> just <b>ran</b> away." ...|$|R
60|$|CAPT. G. (Desperately {{looking at}} his watch.) With a knife. I came down--old Van Loo did, that's to say--and fell on my leg, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> couldn't <b>run.</b> And then this man came up and began {{chopping}} at me as I sprawled.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. I found I'd a {{few hours}} between the trains, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> down to look you up. I met Harry at the house, {{and he told me}} I should find Jane {{qualifying}} for the female parliament.' ...|$|E
60|$|I heard Trip barking, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> {{towards the}} pond. The punt {{was at the}} island, where from behind the bushes I could hear George whistling. I called to him, {{and he came to}} the water's edge half dressed.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see I {{felt ashamed}} of my present, after reading {{and talking about}} being good this morning, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> round the corner and changed it the minute I was up, and I'm so glad, for mine is the handsomest now." ...|$|E
5000|$|Keith Levene (2001): “Putting Religion on {{the album}} with just vocals, I just did that as a producer. I thought that {{this had to be}} done <b>so</b> <b>I</b> said <b>Run</b> it off, John and I just {{recorded}} it. That was a cool idea.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I did, mother. I did {{not know}} you {{intended}} to keep the matter secret. And it did so tickle them! But no one else knows it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> will <b>run</b> back to John and pledge him to secrecy. You can caution Mr Jackman, who will be down directly, no doubt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well then,' {{said the}} small servant, nodding; 'when I {{was near the}} office keyhole--as you see me through, you know--I heard {{somebody}} saying that she lived here, and was the lady whose house you lodged at, and that you was took very bad, and wouldn't nobody come {{and take care of}} you. Mr Brass, he says, [...] "It's no business of mine," [...] he says; and Miss Sally, she says, [...] "He's a funny chap, but it's no business of mine;" [...] and the lady went away, and slammed the door to, when she went out, I can tell you. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> away that night, and come here, and told 'em you was my brother, and they believed me, and I've been here ever since.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw you coming," [...] she said, {{a little}} shyly, [...] "and I {{was afraid that}} you would not stop, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> out as fast as I could. It was silly of me! You were coming in, weren't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she continued, [...] "and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> away to hide, {{intending}} {{to pass the}} cliffs {{to the south of}} Galu and find a retreat in the Kro-lu country. It would be dangerous, but there seemed no other way.|$|E
6000|$|... "I came yesterday, {{and have}} been getting my nest in order; but I could n't keep away any longer, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> up to say 'How do you do?'" [...] {{answered}} Polly, in the cheery voice that did one's heart good to hear.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> on, keeping just comfortably {{ahead of}} him and {{straining}} my eyes in the gloom for cattle-guards and switches that may bring me to grief. Alas! I strain my eyes too far ahead, and trip over something just under my feet, I know not what, some little thing, and go down to earth in a long, stumbling fall. The next moment I am on my feet, but the shack has me by the collar. I do not struggle. I am busy with breathing deeply and with sizing him up. He is narrow-shouldered, and I have at least thirty pounds the better of him in weight. Besides, he is just as tired as I am, and if he tries to slug me, I'll teach him a few things.|$|R
6000|$|... "How could you? I'm {{sorry for}} sick people, and I like to nurse them, {{but it makes}} my legs shake <b>so</b> <b>I</b> have to <b>run</b> away. I'm not a brave girl," [...] sighed Daisy.|$|R
6000|$|It was Jim's voice--nothing ever sounded <b>so</b> good before. <b>I</b> <b>run</b> {{along the}} bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was {{so glad to see}} me. He says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, ma'am, I didn't, but the chemist gave me {{the address}} of one, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> back to tell the poor young thing that I'd go fetch one as quick as I could, and I found him just dying in her arms." ...|$|E
60|$|But I gave little heed to that. My {{principal}} {{thought at}} that moment was my personal safety; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> on as fast as I could {{in the direction of}} our encampment, for which point, I had no doubt, my companions would also make.|$|E
6000|$|... "Father found me, {{and took}} me home, and wanted me to marry a dreadful man, and I wouldn't, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> away to you. He didn't know I came here before, and I'm safe if you'll let me stay," [...] cried Kitty, still {{clinging}} and imploring.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{never had}} any love for Mr. Towser before; but now {{it seemed as if}} he were the very nicest kind of animal that ever lived.

6000|$|... "Then {{two more}} shot," [...] he went on, [...] "quick, together, boom-boom, just like that. 'Borg's shack,' I say to myself, and {{run down the}} trail. I think Borg kill Bella, which was bad. Bella very fine girl," [...] he confided {{with one of his}} irresistible smiles. [...] "I like Bella. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>run.</b> And John he run from his cabin like a fat cow, with great noise. 'What the matter?' he say; and I say, 'I don't know.' And then {{something}} come, wheugh! out of the dark, just like that, and knock John down, and knock me down. We grab everywhere all at once. It is a man. He is in undress. He fight. He cry, 'Oh! Oh! Oh!' just like that. We hold him tight, and bime-by pretty quick, he stop. Then we get up, and I say, 'Come along back.'" ...|$|R
