5|$|The {{original}} building, which incorporated {{stone and}} tiles scavenged from the Roman fort, was a <b>simple</b> <b>one</b> consisting only of a nave and an apsidal chancel, {{with a small}} room, or porticus, built out {{from each of the}} church's northern and southern sides where the nave and chancel met. The church was much altered and expanded during the Middle Ages; the last addition, in the 15th century, was of north and south porches leading into the nave. This expansion coincided with a long period of prosperity for the settlement of Reculver, but its decline led to the church's decay and, in the face of coastal erosion, its almost complete demolition in 1809.|$|E

However, the always defensive Jason Gillespie proved too difficult to get out for England, Harmison menacing him with bouncers and yorkers but not managing it, and it was the quietly toiling Jones who finally got his reward with an away-swinger that crashed into Gillespie's off stump – after having a number of catches dropped, one especially <b>simple</b> <b>one</b> by namesake Geraint. Glenn McGrath and Katich continued with a partnership of 43, as England was set what would be a world record 420 to win.|$|E

25|$|In modern terms, {{the problem}} is an inverse problem, an attempt to deduce the {{parameters}} of a mathematical model from observed data. Though {{the problem is}} a <b>simple</b> <b>one</b> for modern mathematics after the advent of electronic computers, at the time it involved much laborious hand calculation. Adams began by assuming a nominal position for the hypothesised body, using the empirical Bode's law. He then calculated the path of Uranus using the assumed position of the perturbing body and calculated the difference between his calculated path and the observations, in modern terms the residuals. He then adjusted the characteristics of the perturbing body in a way suggested by the residuals and repeated the process, a process similar to regression analysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{drip line}} or trickle acclimating method {{is a safe}} and gentle way to {{introduce}} saltwater fish into a new home, and is a fairly <b>simple</b> <b>one</b> to perform. This procedure {{can be used to}} acclimate all types of marine as well as freshwater livestock. First, the fish is placed with all the bag water in a bucket or container of sufficient size for the fish to be reasonably covered with the water, and the bucket is then set {{on the floor next to}} the aquarium. Using some plastic air line tubing and an air gang valve, a siphon drip line is set up from the aquarium to the bucket. Tank water is allowed to drip slowly into the bucket, using the gang valve to adjust the drip rate, until the water dripped into the bucket equals about two to three times the original volume of the bag water. After testing the pH, salinity, and temperature of the water in the bucket to see if these parameters match that of the tank water, the fish is gently removed and placed into the tank.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all DAPs {{consists}} {{of some kind}} of display screen, although there are exceptions, such as the iPod Shuffle, and a set of controls with which the user can browse through the library of music contained in the device, select a track, and play it back. The display, if the unit even has one, can be anything from a <b>simple</b> <b>one</b> or two line monochrome LCD display, similar to what are found on typical pocket calculators, to large, high-resolution, full-color displays capable of displaying photographs or viewing video content on. The controls can range anywhere from the simple buttons as are found on most typical CD players, such as for skipping through tracks or stopping/starting playback to full touch-screen controls, such as that found on the iPod Touch or the Zune HD. One of the more common methods of control is some type of the scroll wheel with associated buttons. This method of control was first introduced with the Apple iPod and many other manufacturers have created variants of this control scheme for their respective devices.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{approach}} for designing decision procedures {{based on the}} reduction of complex theories to <b>simpler</b> <b>ones.</b> Specifically, we define reduction functions {{as a tool for}} reducing the satisfiability problem of a complex theory to the satisfiability problem of a <b>simpler</b> <b>one.</b> Reduction functions allow us to reduce the theory of lists to the theory of constructors, the theory of arrays to the theory of equality, the theory of sets to the theory of equality, and the theory of multisets to the theory of integers. Finally, we provide a method for combining reduction functions. This method allows us to reduce the satisfiability problem of a combination of complex theories to the combination of <b>simpler</b> <b>ones.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|In the novel, {{the battle}} is not seen until Aslan, Susan, Lucy and their {{reinforcements}} arrive. This was changed in the movie because Adamson said he could vividly remember a huge battle, {{an example of how}} Lewis left a lot to the readers' imagination. Other small changes include the reason all four children come to Narnia, in that an accident breaks a window and forces them to hide. Tumnus also never meets Edmund until the end in the novel. Minor details were added to the Pevensies, such as their mother's name, Helen, being the actual first name of Georgie Henley's mother. Finchley as the home of the Pevensies was inspired by Anna Popplewell, who actually is from Finchley. Adamson also changed the circumstances in which Lucy first comes into Narnia. He felt it was more natural that she first see the wardrobe while looking for a hide-and-seek hiding place, rather than just chance upon it exploring the house. The film also hints at Professor Kirke's role in The Magician's Nephew, such as the engravings on the wardrobe, when it is a <b>simple</b> <b>one</b> in the novel, and the Professor's surprise and intrigue when Peter and Susan mention Lucy's discovery in the wardrobe. When Lewis wrote the novel, {{it was the first of}} the series and the back-story later outlined by the subsequent books in the series did not exist. Additionally in the novel, the father of the Pevensie children is in London with their mother, but in the film, their father is fighting in the war as Lucy states to Mr. Tumnus when they first meet in Narnia.|$|E

500|$|Poe's {{funeral was}} a <b>simple</b> <b>one,</b> held at 4 p.m. on Monday, October 8, 1849. Few people {{attended}} the ceremony. Poe's uncle, Henry Herring, provided a simple mahogany coffin, and a cousin, Neilson Poe, supplied the hearse. Moran's wife made his shroud. The funeral was {{presided over by}} the Reverend W. T. D. Clemm, cousin of Poe's wife, Virginia. Also in attendance were Dr. Snodgrass, Baltimore lawyer and former University of Virginia classmate Zaccheus Collins Lee, Poe's first cousin Elizabeth Herring and her husband, and former schoolmaster Joseph Clarke. The entire ceremony lasted only three minutes in the cold, damp weather. Reverend Clemm decided not to bother with a sermon because the crowd was too small. Sexton George W. Spence wrote of the weather: [...] "It was a dark and gloomy day, not raining but just kind of raw and threatening." [...] Poe was buried in a cheap coffin that lacked handles, a nameplate, cloth lining, or a cushion for his head.|$|E

[...] The Queen makes half of the presentations after the first lesson, and half after the second. [...] Anthems, led by the Chapel Royal choir and the local choir, are sung while the distribution is going on, concluding with George Frideric Handel's coronation anthem Zadok the Priest. [...] The Royal Maundy service concludes with prayers, [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] and the blessing. [...] Two hymns are sung; there is no address. [...] Six silver dishes are used to hold the gifts; one, the traditional Maundy Dish, forms part of the Royal Regalia and is held at the Tower of London when not in use. [...] All six dishes date from the reign of Charles II; five of the six {{have been added to the}} service since 1971. They are held by the Yeomen as the Queen walks about, greeting recipients and giving them their gifts. [...] The Lord High Almoner receives his only recompense for his position if he attends the Royal Maundy service—a small fee, though payable in Maundy money.|$|E
