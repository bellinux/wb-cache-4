40|$|This paper {{provides}} an ethical analysis of <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions</b> under the combined {{framework of the}} categorical imperative and utilitarianism. Developing an ethical model that also encompasses sanction effectiveness {{as a means of}} evaluation, this paper argues that <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions</b> should not be used by countries and legislative bodies as tools of expression or of achieving goals without efficiency considerations grounded in this ethical framework. Only when they clearly meet the criteria of utilitarianism and the categorical imperative should <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions</b> be used. By doing so sanction effectiveness is argued to be maximized, in both ethical and empirical context...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to discuss {{different}} motives behind the perceived transition from economic <b>sanctions</b> towards <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions.</b> The human rights aspect is also considered in the study, in terms of the wider humanism which is associated with <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions.</b> Does this relate to the fact that human rights have got an increased esteem in society, whereas economic, social and cultural rights be on equality with civil and political rights? Economic sanctions have been used extensively during the 1990 s, both by the UN and by different regional organisations and countries. The hardest sanction regime has been imposed on Iraq. In this study, Iraq is used to highlight economic sanctions and the outcome is discussed in order to highlight the transition towards <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions.</b> <b>Smart</b> <b>sanctions</b> have been imposed three times till now, where Zimbabwe was the last example in February 2002. The effects of these sanctions are put in contradiction to Iraq, and the differences them between are discussed. Conclusions are that the ongoing transition and development towards <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions</b> have a multilateral character, where economic, efficiency, ideological, and humane motives areof considerable importance. The humane motives are of most significance for this development. <b>Smart</b> <b>sanctions</b> will continue to develop and be implemented, when international society find it necessary to maintain or restore peace or emphasise the existing rules or norms in the prevailing world. Despite the motives behind the transition towards <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions,</b> the dividing line between the two groups of human rights is still distinct. But due to new initiatives from both the UN and NGOs such as Amnesty International this dividing line is slowly starting to erase. It is not possible now to state that economic, social and cultural rights have got an increased esteem and be on equality with civil and political rights, but if the beginning consciousness is here to stay, it is likely to see an increased esteem in the near future...|$|R

40|$|Abstract 2 <b>Smart</b> <b>sanctions</b> {{have been}} a {{frequent}} but supposedly ineffective UN instrument of conflict resolution {{since the end of}} the Cold War. While most sanctions thinking focuses on sanctions against consolidated states, this paper illustrates how <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions</b> can have an impact in failed states in Sub-Saharan Africa. These failed states are characterised by the lack of a monopoly on violence and plagued by rebellions largely financed through natural resource earnings and foreign support. By analysing the conflicts and respective sanctions regimes and their impact on political support, supply structures and the military balance in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo we prove that in particular the advocacy component of <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions</b> regimes – the panel of expert reports and connected diplomatic activities – is able to contribute to their impact.

40|$|In {{dealing with}} contested regimes, {{international}} aid donors {{must decide whether}} to suspend or continue to provide development assistance to a regime considered illegitimate. Since the 1990 s a general consensus has existed that conventional sanctions are largely ineffective and essentially violate human rights. Responding to this realisation, targeted or ‘smart’ sanctions emerged {{with the aim of}} minimising the impacts of sanctions on civilians, while still targeting the ruling elite. This thesis investigates <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions</b> utilised in a Pacific Island country: Fiji. Following the coups of 1987, 2000 and 2006 three of Fiji’s major aid donors, Australia, New Zealand and the European Union, imposed various levels of <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions</b> including targeted travel bans and sanctioning their aid programmes. In particular, the donors focused on redirecting funding through non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Fiji. Within the sanctions literature a particular gap exists regarding assessment of the impacts on local NGOs. What research does exists has shown that in several cases in Africa, Asia and South America when donors have chosen to channel aid through civil society in response to lagging political reforms, this has at times done more harm than good for local NGOs. Since the imposition of <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions</b> in Fiji there has been no evaluation of how rechanneling aid through NGOs has changed the local development landscape. This research evaluates both the explicit and implicit impacts that <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions</b> imposed on Fiji have had on local NGOs...|$|R

40|$|Economic {{sanctions}} concerning Irans {{nuclear program}} are not having their intended political effect. Uranium enrichment continues despite sanctions. This thesis argues that international economic <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions</b> are failing {{because they are}} not altering the relative positions of power between the factional actors in the Iranian political economy, and because the actors who desire to continue enrichment remain in control of the economy and state institutions. The Iranian political economy is a clientelistic state, with differing rival autonomous patron-actors and associated client bases all competing for a larger slice of economic rents. Economic sanctions have failed because the more conservative actors and their clients have entrenched themselves in the economy and control of these rents, thereby diverting the costs of sanctions to their political competitors while simultaneously using sanctions to strengthen their own client base. Research indicates that while stronger economic sanctions could be designed, their chances of success remain unknown. Only a complete and thoroughly enforced embargo on Iranian petrochemical sales, with a simultaneous economic strengthening of reformist actors in the political economy, who are open to a nuclear enrichment policy change, will result in the political goals sanctions are designed to achieve.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn its three decade history, the Sepah-e Pasdaran-e Englab Eslami, or Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, {{evolved from the}} relatively modest role of ad hoc security apparatus into its current state as an independent and professional, armed force enmeshed {{in the political and}} economic life of modern Iran. In tracing the history of the Guards, one cannot help but take note of how multiple rounds of U. S. sanctions have set the stage for this transformation. Sanctions imposed under the Carter and Reagan administrations created a defense gap by first severing ties between the Iranian and U. S. defense industries and then choking the flow of U. S. war materiel through intermediaries. The Guards, buoyed by their connection to Iranian defense conglomerate DIO, rose with the tide of domestic wartime spending; emerging from the Iran-Iraq War with a considerable construction and manufacturing base. The Guards were then able to leverage this base to dominate postwar reconstruction in Iran, spurred by a gap in foreign development activity exacerbated by the Clinton era <b>sanctions.</b> Today, <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions</b> appear to continue this trend by the creation of a finance gap that is tilting the ongoing privatization of Iran's burgeoning public sector squarely in favor of the Guards.

40|$|Economic {{sanctions}} have {{been referred to}} as a blunt instrument that the international community has often wielded without full consideration of the impact that these measures will have on the population of the targeted countries, particularly the weakest elements of society. Case studies of sanctions against Cuba, Iraq, and Yugoslavia have demon-strated the impact that sanctions can have on the availability of food, cleanwater, andmedicine, causingmany to conclude that all {{sanctions have}} extensive public health consequences. In this article, we examine the generalizability of these conclusions in a quantitative cross-national study of sanctions and their public health effects. Additionally, we compare these effects to those associated with both civil and interstate conflicts as critics have recently suggested that sanctions are not a humane alternative to armed warfare. We find that when sanctions have a large economic effect on the target they can have severe public health consequences. These consequences are substantively similar to those associated with major military conflicts. However, when sanctions have little or no economic effect on the target, they also have no substantive effect on public health. Building on recent work to explore the human consequences of war, this work also helps to demonstrate the importance of <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions</b> and humanitarian exemptions in sanctions policy...|$|R

Furthermore, this article deals with the presidential emergency executive orders on the terrorist list and <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions</b> and on the establishment of military committees for enemy combatants. Finally this contribution deals with the secret orders of the president, concerning domestic spying and the extraordinary rendition programme, by which enemy combatants are abducted in foreign countries and transferred to secret detention centers.

40|$|This report {{proposes that}} the European Union adopts a second {{generation}} human security approach to conflicts, {{as an alternative}} to Geo-Politics or the War on Terror. Second generation human security takes forward the principles of human security and adapts them to 21 st century realities. The report argues that the EU is a new type of 21 st century political institution in contrast to 20 th century nation-states. Twentieth-century nation states were based on a clear distinction between inside and outside. Typical outside instruments were state-to-state diplomacy or economic and military coercion. Typical inside instruments are the rule of law, politics, and policing. In today’s complex, contested and connected world, outside instruments do not work; they backfire and make things worse. Human security is about extending the inside beyond the EU. Hybrid Peace is what happens when 20 th century peace-making is applied in contemporary conflicts. Contemporary conflicts have to be understood not as Clausewitzean contests of will between two sides with legitimate goals but as a sort of predatory social condition in which networks of armed groups instrumentalise extremists identities and enrich themselves through violence. Up to now, the EU has focussed on top-down peace-making, humanitarian assistance and post-conflict reconstruction. These policies can easily be subverted because they can end up entrenching criminalised extremist networks. Second generation human security is about establishing legitimate political authority and legitimate livelihoods to counter this predatory social condition. It encompasses multi-layer, incremental and inclusive peace processes with particular emphasis on support for local ceasefires and civil society; security assistance in establishing safe areas and safe corridors and protecting individuals and their communities; economic measures including justice to undercut the illegal economy. Second generation human security involves continuous engagement so as to combine prevention, early warning, crisis response and reconstruction as intertwined activities, and places emphasis on gender so as to oppose the extreme gender relations that are constructed in contemporary wars. The instruments of second generation human security include:  Creative diplomacy at all levels including smart multilateralism  An emphasis on justice across the entire spectrum of abuse and criminality prevalent in today’s conflicts  The use of <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions</b> where they involve engagement with civil society, impact monitoring, and compliance with international law  Conditionality aimed at countering predation, corruption, sectarianism and impunity rather than introducing neo-liberal reforms  Civilian-led missions that include some combination of humanitarian workers, human rights monitors, legal experts, police and where needed military forces, and that involve both men and wome...|$|R
40|$|From the Introduction. This article {{seeks to}} examine the {{relationship}} between European Union law, international law, and the protection of fundamental rights in the light of recent case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the Court of First Instance (CFI) relating to economic sanctions against individuals. On 3 September 2008, the ECJ delivered its long-awaited judgment in Kadi and Al Barakaat on appeal from the CFI. 3 In its judgment under appeal, 4 the CFI had held that the European Community (EC) is competent to adopt regulations imposing economic sanctions against private organisations in pursuance of UN Security Council (UNSC) Resolutions seeking to combat terrorism; that although the EC is not bound directly by the UN Charter, it is bound pursuant to the EC Treaty to respect international law and give effect to UNSC; and that the CFI has jurisdiction {{to examine the}} compatibility of EC regulations implementing UNSC resolutions with fundamental rights not as protected by the EC but as protected by jus cogens. On appeal, following the Opinion of Maduro AG, the ECJ rejected the CFI’s approach. It held that UNSC resolutions are binding only in international law. It subjected the contested regulations to full review under EC human rights standards and found them in breach of the right to a hearing, the right to judicial protection and the right to property. Kadi and Al Barakaat is the most important judgment ever delivered by the ECJ on the relationship between EC and international law and one of its most important judgments on fundamental rights. It is imbued by constitutional confidence, commitment to the rule of law but also some scepticism towards international law. In the meantime, the CFI has delivered a number of other judgments on anti-terrorist sanctions assessing the limits of the “emergency constitution” at European level. The purpose of this paper is to examine the above case law and explore the dilemmas and tensions facing the EU judiciary in seeking to define and protect the EU’s distinct constitutional space. It is divided as follows. It first looks at the judgment in Kadi. After a short presentation of the factual and legal background, it explores the question whether the EU has competence to adopt <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions.</b> It then examines whether the EU is bound by resolutions of the Security Council, whether the ECJ has jurisdiction to review Community measures implementing such resolutions and the applicable standard of judicial scrutiny.

40|$|The {{period of}} 2014 - 2015 has been {{highlighted}} by {{a multitude of}} diverse external crises that drastically disrupted both national economies and private business. The most demolishing externally initiated shocks for the Norwegian and Russian enterprises were the <b>smart</b> multilateral <b>sanctions</b> against Russia, the Russian food embargo, the national currency slump, and the tremendous crude oil price tumble. Notwithstanding, the destructive power of external shocks can be creative as well. Crises compel business to think “differently” and discover new opportunities {{to survive in the}} deteriorated market environment and win the rivalry with other firms. Thus, the current study intends to elicit the creative power of destructive external crises. This master’s project elucidates the devastating and creative effects of the mentioned above economic shocks on the oil and gas, fishery, and tourism industries in Norway and the Russian Federation. These countries appeared as a “sender” and a “target” nations in the sanctions “war”, and both the Norwegian krone and the Russian rouble devalued as a sequence of the oil price slump, that destructed the oil-reliant national economies. Thence, the companies impinged the urgency to cope with the external crises. The current study expounds a direct connection between the extent of the external shocks’ damaging effect and the range of consecutive undertaken responses. Importantly, the most disrupted firms employed the most radical business- and production-related alterations and innovations to ensure their survival. Moreover, the cross-industrial and cross-national analysis elucidates diverse manners to cope with the external disruptive events. Specifically, {{the role of the state}} engagement, in the form of import substitution policies, was crucial in Russia, while the Norwegian businesses were more independent from the state. Moreover, the large business demonstrated a better ability to survive in the economic turmoil due to their extensive networks and financial resources, while SMEs struggled significantly during the recession. The basal data for the study was conducted from various companies and experts, and is presented in the empirical analysis chapter. Whereas, the core theoretical framework draws on the innovation-, crisis-, and crisis management-related studies. Therefore, the meticulous empirical analysis on the base of the profound conceptual framework contributed to the disclosure of pivotal crisis management strategies and determinant particularities of business scope, industry and country, which foreordained the peculiar extent of the destructions caused by the crises, and success or failure of the undertaken measures...|$|R
40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to answer the}} question of how security in a nuclear weapons free world can best be achieved. In doing so, it analyzes the most severe security threats such a world might have to face and the responses that can be envisioned to counter these threats. The study departs from the conventional approach in so far as it starts from the assumption that the difficult transition phase down to a level of zero nuclear weapons has been managed successfully and that a NWFW already exists. However, it is not assumed in this study that a world free of nuclear weapons will be a world free of risks or security threats. Quite to the contrary, a number of security threats are conceivable and have to be taken seriously. Those stemming from the acquisition {{of weapons of mass destruction}} (WMD) will be investigated systematically. Security threats emanating from a conventional military superiority are beyond the scope of this paper and will not be dealt with. In addition, it is not intended to compare the security threats and benefits of a nuclear weapons free world with a world in which nuclear weapons still exist. However, a comparison of the two conceivable model nuclear weapons free worlds will be provided in order to show the pitfalls of a world of so-called “virtual nuclear arsenals”. After an explanation of these two models of a NWFW, i. e. the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and a world without assembled nuclear weapons, the security threats emanating from NBC weapons cited most often in the debates on deep cuts in nuclear arsenals or a nuclear weapons free world are discussed in some detail. These security threats are 1) a nuclear breakout by a) a cheating ex-NWS trying to renuclearize, b) an NNWS allied with a former NWS, or c) a “pariah state” going nuclear; 2) the use or threat of use of biological and/or chemical weapons, Following the explication of these security threats, a set of possible responses will be assessed in terms of their applicability and usefulness to the model NWFW. The responses analyzed include consultation and clarification procedures and mechanisms, the establishment of ballistic missile defense systems, ways of deterring a violation of a NWFW by conventional military means, <b>smart</b> <b>sanctions</b> and positive incentives, and, last but not least, the provision of non-nuclear security guarantees. “Moving” in such a fictional world free of nuclear weapons obviously has to rest on a set of assumptions which can be subdivided into two broad categories. The first concerns relations between states in general terms and is not necessarily directly related to the goal of nuclear disarmament, but nevertheless forms a basic underpinning for the whole endeavour. The importance of these “world order tasks” should by no means be underestimated as a framework for achieving and maintaining a NWFW. The realization of one of the six tasks, however, stands out: the maintenance of stable relations among the major powers. These include not only the current NWS, but also states like Japan, Germany, and a few others. II II While further nuclear reductions are not the most important precondition here (economic and political factors will assume this function), without such stable, non-competitive relations the goal of a NWFW hardly seems achievable. The second category of assumptions is directly related to a NWFW and includes, first and foremost, the verifiability of the absence of nuclear weapons. The verifiability of a NWFW will - for the purposes of this study - be assumed not to cause insurmountable problems. Secondly, it is assumed that the BW- and CW-control regimes will have reached or are at least close to achieving universal participation and that the BW and CW arsenals of the major powers will have been destroyed. Additional characteristics of a NWFW will be outlined in the section on what exactly constitutes up such a world. The study concludes that security in a NWFW is achievable and does not require the implementation of an unrealistic new world order, featuring a world government or the like. The responses which can reasonably be expected to be available for countering the threats emanating from “NBC desires” that a very limited number of identifiable states may still harbor can be expected to be sufficient for the task. As the analysis shows, the motivations for a clandestine acquisition of nuclear weapons in a NWFW in general are low and can be expected to be strongest in pariah states which find themselves in international isolation, feel threatened by their external environment and are governed by an idiosyncratic leadership. In former nuclear weapons states as well as in nonnuclear weapons states which enjoy stable and friendly external relations, the motivation to acquire WMD for security or prestige reasons or for the support of military action can be assumed to be at least close to, if not absolutely zero. Similarly, CBW use is most likely to be contemplated by a regional aggressor facing a conventionally superior intervention force. These NBC threats might occur in a world in which the normative framework against the possession and use of these categories of weapons will be much more developed than in today´s world. The continuous fulfillment of the six “world order tasks” will provide an international environment conducive to the realization of these norms. In addition, the limited number of states who qualify as suspects for NBC proliferation will be known and on the radar screen either of great powers, or of international organizations tasked to implement the NBC conventions, or of both. This should make it possible to calibrate the mix of responses to the individual perpetrator. However, none of the responses which are available in cases of both nuclear and CBW breakout scenarios should be expected to do the job alone. A composite approach that can be confined to the conventional level seems most promising in dealing with potential proliferators. The first line of defense against any conceivable threat scenario will be formed by consultation and clarification mechanisms and procedures, or more broadly, diplomacy. Although this may sound banal, it is not: opponents of drastic nuclear disarmament steps or the complete elimination of nuclear weapons more often than not portray a NWFW as a world in which one would inevitably be confronted with abundant threats to national survival, with hardly any time to react and certainly no time to engage in lengthy discussions or diplomatic activities. It is by no means certain that this will have to be so. On the contrary, the CWC already disposes of a set of useful provisions, and the protocol to the III BWC currently under negotiation can be expected to contain a similar set of provisions. Negotiations on a nuclear weapons convention will certainly not set lower standards than those established in the context of CBW. This means that the critical point might not necessarily be the availability of consultation and clarification procedures, but rather the inability to come to decisions on how to proceed in case of evidence of a violation within a reasonable time-frame, especially if the - long overdue - reform of the UN Security Council cannot be achieved before a NWFW is established. Defense and protection against WMD will also have to play an important role in a composite strategy for securing a NWFW. While missile defenses against WMD attack will clearly be limited in their impact on an aggressor´s ability to effectively disseminate either nuclear weapons or CBW agents, passive defenses against the latter categories of weapons will be essential in countering CBW threats in a NWFW. On the basis of the assumption that CBW use by a regional aggressor is the most likely scenario, one cannot assume that conventional deterrence will always work. Consequently, it is imperative to limit the damage in case deterrence fails. A limited number of casualties will make possible a limited response, keeping potential destruction as low as possible. However, in case the war aim is set as high as the defeat, disarmament and reform of a regional aggressor, CB defenses will again be instrumental in achieving this aim. <b>Smart</b> <b>sanctions</b> and positive incentive, provide another useful tool in addressing a WMD breakout, short of actually waging a war to redress a situation. Sanctions and conditional incentives can be adapted to a variety of violations and transgressions, singling out those in a non-compliant state who bear the responsibility while at least attempting to limit damage to the (presumably) larger part of the population not involved in the WMD related activities. To the extent that the severity of the violation increases and conditional incentives give way to first smart and then all-out economic sanctions, the ability of the imposing states to address those in charge either individually or as a group will increasingly be lost. Yet the ability to differentiate between a regime leadership and its population is also limited in a war, especially when it comes to punishing counter-value or counter-population strikes by conventional military means. This leads to the role and functions of conventional deterrence in a NWFW. Although the above discussion of conventional deterrence cannot be more than a first sketch of a much more thorough analysis to come, it already seems clear at this point that the old cold war inspired concept of conventional deterrence focusing on a massive Soviet attack on Western Europe is largely outdated. It may retain some relevance in a regional context in which two or more smaller states unite with the aim of deterring a conventionally superior regional great power. On a more general level, however, dynamic deterrence postures will have to be developed which are oriented towards the identifiable suspects and take into account their behavioral characteristics. These conventional deterrence postures will have to be updated regularly so that they reflect evolving threat scenarios. The actual use of conventional military force after deterrence “has failed” will almost certainly represent one of the triggers for such an update. Such an anticipated conventional retaliation might appear a very unpleasant prospect to some. However, certain regions of the world might at times present themselves as rather unpleasant places - the occurrence of NBC proliferation in any country would certainly qualify for that characterization - requiring commensurate responses, one of IV IV which would be the use of conventional military means to restore security and international peace. All these measures provide an impressive array of policy tools which make it possible to address the threat to use or an actual attack involving WMD. We can therefore conclude that achieving security in a NWFW by conventional (military) means is not an “unconventional mirage”, and we should make a NWFW in the true sense of the word the declared endstate of all disarmament and non-proliferation efforts and start laying out the roadmap showing us the way towards this goal. Although a number of proposals have already been made for further disarmament steps on the path leading to zero nuclear weapons, the crucial question of which steps to take in which order needs as much further research as the question of how to integrate the disarmament process in a wider security framework, so as to increase the security of states while the individual disarmament steps are pursued. In addition to further reducing the numbers of nuclear weapons, it will be absolutely essential to focus on the establishment of an adequate institutional framework for a NWFW. Currently, both the normative environment and the organizational structures related to disarmament measures are insufficiently developed for a NWFW. Furthermore, security guarantees have to be re-conceptualized so as to divest them of their nuclear connotations...|$|R
