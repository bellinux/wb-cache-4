25|$|The CFA {{requested}} a site visit to see in-place mock-ups for {{the stone and}} glass walls and their lighting. The effectiveness of the photo-realistic elements were questioned by {{some members of the}} CFA, who pointed out that they created a time-bound (rather than timeless) memorial and had proven ineffective at the Korean War Veterans Memorial. Several commissioners also expressed very strong concern over the significant changes in the bronze panels. But CFA chair Earl A. Powell III (himself a Vietnam War veteran) strongly endorsed it, which appeared to mute these concerns. United States Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs Gordon H. Mansfield, a Vietnam War veteran who was paralyzed in combat, spoke movingly before the CFA in favor of the revised bronzes. Mansfield's testimony, given as a paralyzed individual and not in an official capacity, also helped to win over the CFA. The CFA also asked that the designers study the spacing and placement of the glass panels, the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between the two segments of the stone wall, and whether the stone wall might be broke into three or more sections. Commission members noted that the spotlights on poles might be eliminated, suggesting that light from surrounding buildings and street lights made them unnecessary. They {{requested a}} nighttime lighting study from the memorial planners to help decide the issue.|$|E

50|$|The Casimir {{effect was}} named after Dutch {{physicist}} Hendrik Casimir, who postulated its existence in 1948. Using quantum theory, Casimir predicted that energy should exist even in a vacuum, which can give rise to forces acting on the bodies brought into close proximity of each other. For the simple case of two parallel plates, he postulated that the energy density inside the gap should decrease as the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> decreases, also meaning work {{must be done to}} pull the plates apart. Alternatively, an attractive force that pushes the plates closer together can be said to exist.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{sequence is}} reconstructed from the reads using sequence assembly software. First, overlapping reads are collected into longer composite sequences known as contigs. Contigs {{can be linked}} together into scaffolds by following connections between mate pairs. The distance between contigs can be inferred from the mate pair positions if the average fragment length of the library is known and has a narrow window of deviation. Depending on the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between contigs, different techniques {{can be used to}} find the sequence in the gaps. If the gap is small (5-20kb) then the use of PCR to amplify the region is required, followed by sequencing. If the gap is large (>20kb) then the large fragment is cloned in special vectors such as BAC (Bacterial artificial chromosomes) followed by sequencing of the vector.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} provide a half-tube saxtuba with a {{chromatic}} compass from the second harmonic upwards, {{it is essential to}} provide the player with some means of lowering the pitch of the third harmonic by as many as six semitones, this being the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between the second and third harmonics. Three independent valves will reduce the pitch of a natural or open harmonic by two, one and three semitones respectively. Used singly or in combination, these can bridge the gap between the second and third harmonics, though the player will be required to correct by lipping the faulty intonation produced when independent valves are used in combination. The gaps between the higher harmonics are smaller still, so no more than three valves are required to provide such an instrument with a full chromatic compass; this is true even if the seventh harmonic is not used.|$|E
