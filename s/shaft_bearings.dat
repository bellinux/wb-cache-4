2500|$|Bozeman Victory {{served as}} an {{ammunition}} ship in the Pacific War. Bozeman Victory departed Mukilteo, Washington with ammunition to supply troops at Okinawa for the Battle of Okinawa. The Battle of Okinawa was 82 days, lasted from April 1 until June 22, 1945. On April 28, 1945 a Japanese assault demolition boat causes extensive damage to the Bozeman Victory. [...] US Navy gunboats were credited with keeping the ships at the bay off Okinawa safe. But a Japanese explosive speedboat slipped through. Bozeman Victory was hit at 2:10am while at anchor. Bozeman Victory hull plates were badly damaged near cargo hold #4. [...] Six crew members were injured in the attack. Some of propeller <b>shaft</b> <b>bearings</b> were cracked in the hit, these immobilized the ship. This damage was bad, {{but none of the}} ships cargo, 6,000 tons of ammunition was damaged. The explosive speedboat may have been a Kaiten, a suicide torpedo, or Midget Submarine.|$|E
2500|$|The line of General Purpose (GP) Acme threads (ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) are not {{designed}} to sustain external radial loads and both the nut and bolt are, ideally, independently supported, the nut by a linear guide and the screw by <b>shaft</b> <b>bearings.</b> This {{is due to the}} need to avoid [...] "wedging" [...] of the thread flanks when subjected to radial loads, which would contribute substantially to friction forces and thread wear. However, there is a centralizing Acme-thread standard (also specified in ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) which caters to applications where the threads are not radially supported, where the roots and crests of opposing threads are designed to come into contact before the flanks do, under radial loads. This adds the requirement that the sum of the allowances and tolerances on the major diameters of nut and bolt be less than the sum of the allowances on the pitch diameters (PD); the drawback is that, for a given amount of end play (axial clearance, due solely to PD deviations), closer tolerances and cleaner work environment are necessitated in the application of a centralizing Acme thread.|$|E

40|$|Semi-deep {{foundations}} socketed in {{rocks are}} considered to be a viable option for the foundations in the presence of heavy load imposed by high-rise structures, due to the low settlement and high bearing capacity. In the optimum design of semi-deep foundations, prediction of the <b>shaft</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity, rs, of foundations socketed in rocks is thus critically important. In this study, the unconfined compressive strength (UCS), qu, has been applied in order to investigate the <b>shaft</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity. For this, a database of 106 full-scale load tests is compiled with UCS values of surrounding rocks, in which 34 tests with rock quality designation (RQD), and 5 tests with rock mass rating (RMR). The bearing rocks for semi-deep foundations include limestone, mudstone, siltstone, shale, granite, tuff, granodiorite, claystone, sandstone, phyllite, schist, and greywacke. Using the database, the applicability and accuracy of the existing empirical methods are evaluated and new relations are derived between the <b>shaft</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity and UCS based on the types of rocks. Moreover, a general equation in case of unknown rock types is proposed and it is verified by another set of data. Since rock-socketed shafts are supported by rock mass (not intact rock), a reduction factor for the compressive strength is suggested and verified in which the effect of discontinuities is considered using the modified UCS, qu(modified), based upon RMR and RQD in order {{to take into account the}} effect of the rock mass properties...|$|R
