50|$|Kuznyechik {{is based}} on a <b>substitution-permutation</b> network, though the key {{schedule}} employs a Feistel network. The first block cipher with a mixed structure.|$|E
5000|$|One {{advantage}} of the Feistel model compared to a <b>substitution-permutation</b> network is that the round function [...] {{does not have to}} be invertible.|$|E
50|$|In cryptography, an SP-network, or <b>substitution-permutation</b> network (SPN), is {{a series}} of linked {{mathematical}} operations used in block cipher algorithms such as AES (Rijndael), 3-Way, Kuznyechik, PRESENT, SAFER, SHARK, and Square.|$|E
5000|$|The Lai-Massey scheme offers {{security}} properties {{similar to}} those of the Feistel structure. It also shares its advantage over a <b>substitution-permutation</b> network that the round function [...] does not have to be invertible.|$|E
50|$|BaseKing has a {{block size}} of 192 bits - {{twice as long}} as 3-Way, and notably not a power of two as with most block ciphers. The key length is also 192 bits. BaseKing is an 11-round <b>substitution-permutation</b> network.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{sketch of}} a <b>Substitution-Permutation</b> Network with 3 rounds, {{encrypting}} a plaintext block of 16 bits into a ciphertext block of 16 bits. The S-boxes are the Si’s, the P-boxes are the same P, and the round keys are the Ki’s.|$|E
50|$|The {{algorithm}} uses a <b>substitution-permutation</b> {{network structure}} based on AES. The interface {{is the same}} as AES: 128-bit block size with key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits. The number of rounds is 12, 14, or 16, depending on the key size. ARIA uses two 8&times;8-bit S-boxes and their inverses in alternate rounds; one of these is the Rijndael S-box.|$|E
50|$|Substitution ciphers as {{discussed}} above, especially the older pencil-and-paper hand ciphers, {{are no longer}} in serious use. However, the cryptographic concept of substitution carries on even today. From a sufficiently abstract perspective, modern bit-oriented block ciphers (e.g., DES, or AES) can be viewed as substitution ciphers on an enormously large binary alphabet. In addition, block ciphers often include smaller substitution tables called S-boxes. See also <b>substitution-permutation</b> network.|$|E
5000|$|KHAZAD has an eight-round <b>substitution-permutation</b> network {{structure}} {{similar to that}} of SHARK, a forerunner to Rijndael. The design is classed as a [...] "legacy-level" [...] algorithm, with a 64-bit block size (in common with older ciphers such as DES and IDEA) and a 128-bit key. KHAZAD makes heavy use of involutions as subcomponents; this minimises the difference between the algorithms for encryption and decryption.|$|E
50|$|One {{important}} type of iterated {{block cipher}} {{known as a}} <b>substitution-permutation</b> network (SPN) takes a block of the plaintext and the key as inputs, and applies several alternating rounds consisting of a substitution stage followed by a permutation stage—to produce each block of ciphertext output. The non-linear substitution stage mixes the key bits {{with those of the}} plaintext, creating Shannon's confusion. The linear permutation stage then dissipates redundancies, creating diffusion.|$|E
50|$|Grand Cru is a 10-round <b>substitution-permutation</b> {{network based}} largely on Rijndael (or AES). It replaces a number of Rijndael's unkeyed {{operations}} with key-dependent ones, in a way consistent with the security purposes of each operation. The intent is to produce a cipher at least as secure as Rijndael, and perhaps much more secure. The block size and key size are both 128 bits, and the key schedule {{is the same as}} Rijndael's.|$|E
50|$|VEST {{is based}} on a {{balanced}} T-function that can also be described as a bijective nonlinear feedback shift register with parallel feedback (NLPFSR) or as a <b>substitution-permutation</b> network, which is assisted by a non-linear RNS-based counter. The four VEST family trees described in the cipher specification are VEST-4, VEST-8, VEST-16, and VEST-32. VEST ciphers support keys and IVs of variable sizes and instant re-keying. All VEST ciphers release output on every clock cycle.|$|E
50|$|The Hill cipher is {{vulnerable}} to a known-plaintext attack because it is completely linear, {{so it must be}} combined with some non-linear step to defeat this attack. The combination of wider and wider weak, linear diffusive steps like a Hill cipher, with non-linear substitution steps, ultimately leads to a <b>substitution-permutation</b> network (e.g. a Feistel cipher), so it is possible - from this extreme perspective - to consider modern block ciphers as a type of polygraphic substitution.|$|E
50|$|SXAL is an 8-round <b>substitution-permutation</b> {{network with}} block size and key size of 64 bits each. All {{operations}} are byte-oriented. The algorithm uses a single 8&times;8-bit S-box K, {{designed so that}} both K(X) and X XOR K(X) are injective functions. In each round, the bytes of the block are first permuted. Then each byte is XORed with a key byte and an earlier ciphertext byte, processed through the S-box, and XORed with the previous plaintext byte.|$|E
50|$|Like DES, LOKI97 is a 16-round Feistel cipher, {{and like}} other AES candidates, has a 128-bit block size and {{a choice of}} a 128-, 192- or 256-bit key length. It uses 16 rounds of a {{balanced}} feistel network to process the input data blocks (see diagram right). The complex round function f incorporates two <b>substitution-permutation</b> layers in each round.The key schedule is also a Feistel structure — an unbalanced one unlike the main network — but using the same F-function.|$|E
50|$|Like other AES submissions, Serpent has a {{block size}} of 128 bits and {{supports}} a key size of 128, 192 or 256 bits. The cipher is a 32-round <b>substitution-permutation</b> network {{operating on a}} block of four 32-bit words. Each round applies one of eight 4-bit to 4-bit S-boxes 32 times in parallel. Serpent was designed so that all operations can be executed in parallel, using 32 bit slices. This maximizes parallelism, but also allows use of the extensive cryptanalysis work performed on DES.|$|E
5000|$|... 3-Way has a {{block size}} of 96 bits, notably not {{a power of}} two such as the more common 64 or 128 bits. The key length is also 96 bits. The figure 96 arises {{from the use of}} three 32 bit words in the algorithm, from which also is derived the cipher's name. When 3-Way was invented, 96-bit keys and blocks were quite strong, but more recent ciphers have a 128-bit block, and few now have keys shorter than 128 bits. 3-Way is an 11-round <b>substitution-permutation</b> network.|$|E
5000|$|The {{algorithm}} uses a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits. It {{operates on}} blocks of 128 bits using a <b>substitution-permutation</b> network structure. There are 8 rounds for a 128-bit key and 9 rounds {{for a longer}} key. Q uses S-boxes adapted from Rijndael (also known as AES) and Serpent. It combines the nonlinear operations from these ciphers, but leaves out all the linear transformations except the permutation. Q also uses a constant derived from the golden ratio {{as a source of}} [...] "nothing up my sleeve numbers".|$|E
50|$|AES {{is based}} on a design {{principle}} known as a <b>substitution-permutation</b> network, a combination of both substitution and permutation, and is fast in both software and hardware. Unlike its predecessor DES, AES does not use a Feistel network. AES is a variant of Rijndael which has a fixed block size of 128 bits, and a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits. By contrast, the Rijndael specification per se is specified with block and key sizes that may be any multiple of 32 bits, both with a minimum of 128 and a maximum of 256 bits.|$|E
50|$|One aim of {{confusion}} {{is to make}} it very hard to find the key even if one has a large number of plaintext-ciphertext pairs produced with the same key. Therefore, each bit of the ciphertext should depend on the entire key, and in different ways on different bits of the key. In particular, changing one bit of the key should change the ciphertext completely.The simplest way to achieve both diffusion and confusion is to use a <b>substitution-permutation</b> network. In these systems, the plaintext and the key often have a very similar role in producing the output, hence the same mechanism ensures both diffusion and confusion.|$|E
50|$|The modern {{design of}} block ciphers {{is based on}} the concept of an {{iterated}} product cipher. In his seminal 1949 publication, Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems, Claude Shannon analyzed product ciphers and suggested them as a means of effectively improving security by combining simple operations such as substitutions and permutations. Iterated product ciphers carry out encryption in multiple rounds, each of which uses a different subkey derived from the original key. One widespread implementation of such ciphers, named a Feistel network after Horst Feistel, is notably implemented in the DES cipher. Many other realizations of block ciphers, such as the AES, are classified as <b>substitution-permutation</b> networks.|$|E
5000|$|The Hierocrypt ciphers use a nested <b>substitution-permutation</b> network (SPN) structure. Each round {{consists}} of parallel applications of a transformation called the XS-box, {{followed by a}} linear diffusion operation. The final half-round replaces the diffusion with a simplepost-whitening. The XS-box, which is shared by the two algorithms, is itself an SPN, consisting of a subkey XOR, an S-box lookup, a linear diffusion, another subkey XOR, and another S-box lookup. The diffusion operations use two MDS matrices, {{and there is a}} single 8&times;8-bit S-box. The key schedule uses the binary expansions of the square roots of some small integers as a source of [...] "nothing up my sleeve numbers".|$|E
50|$|In cryptography, {{integral}} cryptanalysis is a cryptanalytic {{attack that}} is particularly applicable to block ciphers based on <b>substitution-permutation</b> networks. It was originally designed by Lars Knudsen as a dedicated attack against Square, so it {{is commonly known as}} the Square attack. It was also extended to a few other ciphers related to Square: CRYPTON, Rijndael, and SHARK. Stefan Lucks generalized the attack to what he called a saturation attack and used it to attack Twofish, which is not at all similar to Square, having a radically different Feistel network structure. Forms of integral cryptanalysis have since been applied to a variety of ciphers, including Hierocrypt, IDEA, Camellia, Skipjack, MISTY1, MISTY2, SAFER++, KHAZAD, and FOX (now called IDEA NXT).|$|E
50|$|The {{procedure}} for constructing approximations is different for each cipher. In {{the most basic}} type of block cipher, a <b>substitution-permutation</b> network, analysis is concentrated primarily on the S-boxes, the only nonlinear part of the cipher (i.e. the operation of an S-box cannot be encoded in a linear equation). For small enough S-boxes, {{it is possible to}} enumerate every possible linear equation relating the S-box's input and output bits, calculate their biases and choose the best ones. Linear approximations for S-boxes then must be combined with the cipher's other actions, such as permutation and key mixing, to arrive at linear approximations for the entire cipher. The piling-up lemma is a useful tool for this combination step. There are also techniques for iteratively improving linear approximations (Matsui 1994).|$|E
50|$|Kalyna (Ukrainian: Калина, Viburnum opulus) is a {{symmetric}} block cipher. It supports block {{sizes of}} 128, 256 or 512 bits; the key length is either {{equal to or}} double the block size. Kalyna was adopted as the national encryption standard of Ukraine in 2015 (standard DSTU 7624:2014) after holding Ukrainian national cryptographic competition. Kalyna is a <b>substitution-permutation</b> network and its design {{is based on the}} Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption function having quite different key schedule, another set of four different S-boxes and increased MDS-matrix size. Kalyna has 10 rounds for 128-bit keys, 14 rounds for 256-bit keys and 18 rounds for 512-bit keys. Independent researchers proposed some attacks on reduced-round variants of Kalyna, but all of them have a very high complexity and none of them are practical.|$|E
5000|$|Integral {{cryptanalysis}} is a cryptanalytic {{attack that}} is particularly applicable to block ciphers based on <b>substitution-permutation</b> networks. Unlike differential cryptanalysis, which uses pairs of chosen plaintexts with a fixed XOR difference, integral cryptanalysis uses sets or even multisets of chosen plaintexts of which part is held constant and another part varies through all possibilities. For example, an attack might use 256 chosen plaintexts that have all but 8 of their bits the same, but all differ in those 8 bits. Such a set necessarily has an XOR sum of 0, and the XOR sums of the corresponding sets of ciphertexts provide information about the cipher's operation. This contrast between the differences of pairs of texts and the sums of larger sets of texts inspired the name [...] "integral cryptanalysis", borrowing the terminology of calculus.|$|E
50|$|LUCIFER uses a {{combination}} of Transposition and Substitution crypting {{as a starting point}} in decoding ciphers. One variant, described by Feistel in 1971, uses a 48-bit key and operates on 48-bit blocks. The cipher is a <b>Substitution-permutation</b> network and uses two 4-bit S-boxes. The key selects which S-boxes are used. The patent describes the execution of the cipher operating on 24-bits at a time, and also a sequential version operating on 8-bits at a time. Another variant by John L. Smith from the same year uses a 64-bit key operating on a 32-bit block, using one addition mod 4 and a singular 4-bit S-box. The construction is designed to operate on 4 bits per clock cycle. This {{may be one of the}} smallest block-cipher implementations known. Feistel later described a stronger variant that uses a 128-bit key and operates on 128-bit blocks.|$|E
5000|$|Anubis {{operates}} on data blocks of 128 bits, accepting keys of length 32N bits (N = 4, ..., 10). It is {{designed as a}} <b>substitution-permutation</b> network, which bears large similarity to Rijndael. Like KHAZAD, designed by the same authors and also submitted to NESSIE, it uses involutions for the various operations. An involution is an operation whose inverse {{is the same as}} the forward operation. In other words, when an involution is run twice, it is the same as performing no operation. This allows low-cost hardware and compact software implementations to use the same operations for both encryption and decryption. Both the S-box and the mix columns operations are involutions. Although many involutional components can make a cipher more susceptible to distinguishing attacks exploiting the cycle structure of permutations within the cipher, no attack strategy for the Anubis cipher has been presented.|$|E
5000|$|Consider a hash {{function}} which uses an AES-like <b>substitution-permutation</b> block cipher as its compression function. This compression function {{consists of a}} number of rounds composed of S-Boxes and linear transformations. The general idea of the attack is to construct a differential characteristic that has its most computationally expensive part in the middle. This part will then be covered by the inbound phase, whereas the more easily achieved part of the characteristic is covered in the outbound phase. The system of equations, which describe the characteristic in the inbound, phase should be underdetermined, such that many starting points for the outbound phase can be generated. Since the more difficult part of the characteristic is contained in the inbound phase it is possible to use standard differentials here, whereas truncated differentials are used in the outbound phase to achieve higher probabilities.|$|E
50|$|Rijndael is a substitution-linear {{transformation}} {{network with}} ten, twelve, or fourteen rounds, {{depending on the}} key size, and with block sizes of 128 bits, 192 bits, or 256 bits, independently specified. Serpent is a <b>substitution-permutation</b> network which has thirty-two rounds, plus an initial and a final permutation to simplify an optimized implementation. The round function in Rijndael consists of three parts: a nonlinear layer, a linear mixing layer, and a key-mixing XOR layer. The round function in Serpent consists of key-mixing XOR, thirty-two parallel applications of the same 4×4 S-box, and a linear transformation, except in the last round, wherein another key-mixing XOR replaces the linear transformation. The nonlinear layer in Rijndael uses an 8×8 S-box whereas Serpent uses eight different 4×4 S-boxes. The 32 rounds means that Serpent has a higher security margin than Rijndael; however, Rijndael with 10 rounds is faster and easier to implement for small blocks. Hence, Rijndael {{was selected as the}} winner in the AES competition.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine {{a class of}} product ciphers {{referred}} to as <b>substitution-permutation</b> networks. We investigate the resistance of these cryptographic networks to two important attacks: differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis. In particular, we develop upper bounds on the differential characteristic probability and on {{the probability of a}} linear approximation {{as a function of the}} number of rounds of substitutions. Further, it is shown that using large S-boxes with good diffusion characteristics and replacing the permutation between rounds by an appropriate linear transformation is effective in improving the cipher security in relation to these two attacks.

30|$|As a first example, {{many new}} block ciphers were {{proposed}} as lightweight {{alternatives to the}} Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [104]. Important constructions are LS-Designs [105], modern ARX and Feistel networks [106], and <b>substitution-permutation</b> networks [107, 108].

In addition, we propose a new design of strong and efficient key-schedule algorithms...|$|E
