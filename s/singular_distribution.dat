50|$|A <b>singular</b> <b>distribution</b> {{is not a}} {{discrete}} probability distribution because each discrete point has a zero probability. On the other hand, neither {{does it have a}} probability density function, since the Lebesgue integral of any such function would be zero.|$|E

25|$|The {{definition}} {{states that}} a continuous probability distribution must possess a density, or equivalently, its {{cumulative distribution function}} be absolutely continuous.

50|$|This {{distribution}} {{has neither}} a probability density function nor a probability mass function, since {{although it is}} a continuous function it is not absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure, nor has it any point-masses.

The Marshall-Olkin bivariate Weibull distribution is a <b>singular</b> <b>distribution,</b> whose both the marginals are univariate Weibull distributions.

The cumulative joint distribution of the Marshall-Olkin bivariate Weibull distribution {{is a mixture of}} an absolute continuous distribution function and a <b>singular</b> <b>distribution</b> function. This distribution has four unknown parameters and it is observed that the maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown parameters can not be obtained in explicit forms.

40|$|The {{need for}} calculating and characterizing <b>singular</b> normal <b>distributions</b> arises {{in a natural}} way when {{considering}} chance constraints of the type P(Az = p, where A is a rectangular matrix having more rows than columns, b is some function and z is a random vector having some nondegenerate multivariate normal distribution. Such situation is typical, for instance, in stochastic networks, where a comparatively small random vector may induce a possibly large number of linear inequality constraints. Passing to the transformed random variable q:=Az, the constraint can be equivalently rewritten as F(b(x)) >= p, where F is the distribution function of q. In contrast to the original random vector z, the transformed vector q has a <b>singular</b> normal <b>distribution.</b> The talk demonstrates how to get back from here to (a sum of) regular normal distributions under a full rank regularity condition. This allows for an efficient calculation of <b>singular</b> normal <b>distributions</b> and provides a numerical method which outperforms competing procedures in moderate dimensions. Computational results for test examples are provided {{for the sake of}} comparison. In general, if the mentioned regularity condition is violated, then the <b>singular</b> normal <b>distribution</b> function F may even lack continuity.

40|$|We {{show how}} the {{recently}} proposed Taylor-Lagrange renormalization scheme can lead to extensions of <b>singular</b> <b>distributions</b> which are reminiscent of the Pauli-Villars subtraction. However, at variance with the Pauli-Villars regularization scheme, no infinite mass limit is performed in this scheme. As an illustration of this mechanism, we consider the calculation of the self-energy in second order perturbation theory in the Yukawa model, within the covariant formulation of light-front dynamics. We show in particular how rotational invariance is preserved in this scheme. Comment: 9 pages, 1 figure To be published in Physical Review...|$|R

The approximate models we analyze (essentially discrete and continuous vortex ﬁlaments and vortex loops) are related to some problem of classical physics con- cerning turbulence and also to the numerical approximation of ﬂows with very high Reynolds number.
