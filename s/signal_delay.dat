25|$|The SSRT test is similar, {{except that}} the 'stop' signal is {{presented}} after the 'go' signal. This small modification increases the difficulty of inhibiting the 'go' response, because the participant has typically already initiated the 'go' response {{by the time the}} 'stop' signal is presented. The participant is instructed to respond as fast as possible to the 'go' signal while maintaining the highest possible inhibition accuracy (on no-go trials). During the task, the time at which the 'stop' signal is presented (the stop <b>signal</b> <b>delay</b> or SSD) is dynamically adjusted to match the time after the 'go' signal at which the participant is just able/unable to inhibit their 'go' response. If the participant fails to inhibit their 'go' response, the 'stop' signal is moved slightly closer to the original 'go' signal, and if the participant successfully inhibits their 'go' response, the 'stop' signal is moved slightly ahead in time. The SSRT is thus measured as the average 'go' response time minus the average 'stop' signal presentation time (SSD).|$|E

The absorption and slow-down effects are compared for three schemes i. e. Ξ, V and Λ, corresponding to different excitation configurations. Qualitative differences of the V-scheme compared to the Ξ- and Λ-scheme are found, which show that features of Autler-Townes splitting are only revealed in the V-scheme. The underlying physical mechanisms causing this discrepancy are analyzed and discussed. Finally we compare field propagation calculations of the schemes showing significantly larger achievable <b>signal</b> <b>delays</b> for the V-scheme despite finite absorption of the coupling field. This opens the possibility for using waveguide structures for both coupling and probe fields, thus significantly increasing the achievable <b>signal</b> <b>delays...</b>|$|R

40|$|A concurrent-chain {{schedule}} {{was employed to}} examine pigeons' preferences for <b>signaled</b> versus unsignaled <b>delay</b> of reinforcement in which the delay durations ranged from zero to ten seconds. In general, pigeons preferred <b>signaled</b> <b>delay</b> over unsignaled delay especially when a variable-interval 30 -second schedule operated in each initial link; when a variable-interval 90 -second schedule operated in each initial link, these preferences tended toward indifference or were attenuated. In addition, prior training seemed to exert partial control over behavior. Responding in the terminal link was higher under <b>signaled</b> <b>delay</b> than unsignaled delay in a majority of the cases. Moreover, response rates under <b>signaled</b> <b>delay</b> remained fairly constant whereas responding under unsignaled delay was initially high, but decreased systematically with delay durations as short as 2. 5 seconds. These results are consistent with a number of other studies demonstrating the significant role of a signal for impending positive stimuli...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{statistical}} analysis of delay faults {{which is based on}} the assumption of a linear combination of <b>signal</b> <b>delays</b> along a path. In order to consider distributed <b>signal</b> <b>delays</b> and to reflect that only few paths can be sensitized, the path delay fault model is applied. By choosing appropriate values for parameters, e. g. cycle time and correlations between <b>signal</b> <b>delays,</b> it is possible to adjust this approach to specific design methodologies. The statistical analysis leads to a new measure called Delay Fault Probability (DFP), which expresses the probability of a delay fault.

40|$|Next-generation {{wireless}} {{networks have}} been envisioned {{to be an}} integration of heterogeneous wireless access networks such as UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication Networks) and the IEEE 802. 11 based WLAN (Wireless Local Area Networks). It is an important and challenging issue to support seamless vertical handoff management in such an integrated architecture that provides the mobile users uninterrupted service continuity anywhere, any time. In such a networking environment, the <b>signaling</b> <b>delay</b> of the vertical handoff is not fixed due to the traffic load in the backbone Internet, wireless channel quality and the distance between a mobile node and its home network. However, the currently handoff solutions implicitly considers the <b>signaling</b> <b>delay</b> as a constant value. In this thesis, we study a typical link layer assisted handoff, identifying its deficiency due to the considerably large handoff delay. We propose an adaptive vertical handoff management scheme for integrated UMTS and WLAN networks. The proposed scheme incorporates the idea of pre-handoff with adaptive handoff threshold. We estimate the handoff <b>signaling</b> <b>delay</b> in advance, therefore, providing the delay information required for making an adaptive handoff decision. Instead of setting a fixed threshold, an adaptive handoff threshold value is determined for every single MN based on the estimated handoff <b>signaling</b> <b>delay.</b> The RSS and the RSS's rate of change are {{used to determine the}} estimated handoff time instant. Extensive simulation has been conducted to verify the performance of the proposed handoff scheme...|$|R

The technique works best in the lower stratosphere and uppertroposphere; it breaks down close to the Earth surface especially in thetropics, due to water vapour extinction.|$|E
50|$|It {{is common}} for two signals to share an {{identical}} path, branch and follow different paths for a while, then converge {{back to the same}} point to produce a result. When this happens, you can remove a fair amount of uncertainty from the total delay because you know that they shared a common path for a while. Even though each signal has an uncertain delay, because their delays were identical for part of the journey the total uncertainty can be reduced. This tightens up the worst-case estimation for the <b>signal</b> <b>delay,</b> and usually allows a small but important speedup of the overall device.|$|E
40|$|Food-deprived rats (at 80 % {{of their}} free-feeding weights) {{were exposed to}} a fixed-time 60 -s {{schedule}} of food-pellet presentation and developed schedule-induced drinking. Lick-dependent <b>signaled</b> <b>delays</b> (10 s) to food presentation led to decreased drinking, which recovered when the <b>signaled</b> <b>delays</b> were discontinued. A major effect of this punishment contingency was to increase the proportion of interpellet intervals without any licks. The drinking of yoked control rats, which received food at the same times as those exposed to the <b>signaled</b> <b>delay</b> contingency (masters), was not consistently reduced. When food-deprivation level was changed to 90 %, all master and yoked control rats showed decreases in punished or unpunished schedule-induced drinking. When the body weights were reduced to 70 %, most master rats increased punished behavior to levels {{similar to those of}} unpunished drinking. This effect was not observed for yoked controls. Therefore, body-weight loss increased the resistance of schedule-induced drinking to reductions by punishment. Food-deprivation effects on punished schedule-induced drinking are similar to their effects on food-maintained lever pressing. This dependency of punishment on food-deprivation level supports the view that schedule-induced drinking can be modified by the same variables that affect operant behavior in general...|$|R
40|$|Feedback {{signaling}} plays a {{key role}} in flow control because the traffic source relies on the signaling information to make correct and timely flow-control decisions. Design of an efficient signaling algorithm is a challenging task since the signaling messages can tolerate neither error nor latency. Multicast flow-control signaling imposes two additional challenges: scalability and feedback synchronization. Previous research on multicast feedback-synchronization signaling has mainly focused on the algorithm design and implementation. However, the delay properties of these algorithms are, despite their vital importance, neither well understood nor thoroughly studied. In this paper, we develop both deterministic and statistical binary-tree models to study the delay performance of the multicast signaling algorithms. The deterministic model is used to derive the expressions of each path’s feedback roundtrip time in a multicast tree, while the statistical model is employed to derive the general probability distributions of each path becoming the multicast-tree bottleneck. Using these models, we analyze and contrast the <b>signaling</b> <b>delay</b> scalability of two representative multicast signaling protocols—the Soft-Synchronization Protocol (SSP) and the Hop-By-Hop (HBH) scheme—by deriving the first and second moments of multicast <b>signaling</b> <b>delays.</b> Also derived is the optimal flow-control update interval for SSP to minimize the multicast <b>signaling</b> <b>delay...</b>|$|R
