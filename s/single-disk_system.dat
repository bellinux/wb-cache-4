40|$|Providing {{high level}} of the fault {{tolerance}} in a small system would be hard because of cost and efficiency concern. We developed a Storage Reliability Analyzer (SOAR) to test and to evaluate a fault tolerance of a <b>single-disk</b> <b>system.</b> SOAR is a standalone device which consist of a portable case, a folding LCD monitor, fault injection software, and SATA multiplexer card. The fault injection software was implemented in Linux. The OS of target is irrelevant because SOAR injects faults directly to the HDD of target. It can inject fault in real time through the SATA multiplexer card while the target is in operation. The tolerance of the target system could be evaluated with variety of errors of logical (device driver) and physical (ECC area of disk) faults. For easy evaluation and testing, there provided three test frame works, multimedia player, benchmark, and file system. This paper presents three groups of case studies: multimedia applications (AVIfile, MTV, Mplayer, RealPlayer, and Freeamp), CE device (Tvix Player), file system benchmark tools (LMbench, and IOzone), and file systems (Ext 3, Ext 4, JFS, and F 2 FS).

40|$|International audienceThe {{new method}} of the forced {{resonance}} vibrations construction in mechanical systems with internal resonance is represented. According to this approach, the generalized theory of non-linear normal vibration modes by Shaw and Pierre, the modified Rauscher method and the harmonic balance method are {{combined with a}} new iterative computation procedure. The proposed approach is used in analysis of the <b>single-disk</b> rotor <b>system</b> with the isotropic-elastic shaft and the non-linear supports of Duffing type. Gyroscopic effects, asymmetrical disposition of the disk on the shaft and internal resonance are also taken into account. The NNM approach allows reducing the 8 -DOF problem of the rotor dynamics to the 2 -DOF non-linear system for each non-linear normal mode. Both the model of massless supports and the model of supports with inertial effects are considered. It is shown that in last case all resonance regimes are separated into two different kinds. First kind corresponds to cyclic symmetric trajectories in a system's configuration space; the second kind corresponds to centrally symmetric ones. Regimes of the first kind can be evaluated {{by the use of}} the simplified mathematical model proposed in this work. Simplified model consists only of four generalized coordinates instead of the eight initial ones...|$|R
