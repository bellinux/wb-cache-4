5000|$|On 11 July 2012, Princess Elizabeth {{hauled the}} Royal Train from Newport to Hereford and again from Worcester to Oxford {{as part of}} the Diamond Jubilee Tour. The loco carried the {{traditional}} four lamp combination (one lamp {{at the top of the}} smokebox and three on the buffer lamp irons) used on trains conveying the Head of State, although no headboard was carried. It is only the second time in preservation that the Queen has been conveyed on a steam-hauled Royal Train on the Mainline. (The other was also an LMS loco 6233 Duchess of Sutherland in 2002 where Princess Elizabeth was the <b>stand-by</b> <b>engine).</b> It is believed that it was the first time that the Queen has travelled behind the locomotive that was named after her and the event came just a few weeks before the 50th anniversary of the preservation of the loco, which has been owned by the Princess Elizabeth Locomotive Society longer than under both the LMS and British Railways. No. 6201 was withdrawn from service in July 2012 for a piston and valve examination at the Tyseley Locomotive Works, and after repairs she returned to service on 17 November hauling the Vintage Trains [...] "Cumbrian Mountaineer" [...] from Carnforth to Carlisle. She was withdrawn for overhaul at the end of December 2012 having completed her longest period of operation in preservation.|$|E
40|$|Optimize {{the use of}} biogas in {{an engine}} {{generator}} set to produce usable thermal and electrical energy by controlling air fuel ratio and ignition timing. The proportion of electrical and thermal energy was also determined. All experimentation was with a <b>stand-by</b> <b>engine</b> generator set operating on natural gas in laboratory conditions;The first stage of the investigation {{was to develop a}} data logging and control system to measure engine parameters and control engine variables. Parameters measured were: mass gas flow rate, mass air flow rate, air fuel ratio, engine coolant inlet and exit temperatures, coolant flow rate, gas temperature, air temperature, engine speed, exhaust temperature and generator power. The variables controlled included: ignition timing, air fuel ratio, coolant exit temperature and electrical power. All parameters and variables (except electrical power) were measured and controlled by a microcomputer and interface system;Secondly, the system was used to determine the relation between ignition timing, air fuel ratio, electrical and thermal energy conversion from natural gas for different electrical loads and constant engine temperature. It was found that the ignition timing had little effect on thermal energy, but for near maximum electrical load, the maximum electrical efficiency was with an ignition advance of 23 degrees BTDC. Optimum air fuel ratio for total energy production (thermal + electrical) was found to be in the range of 17. 8 to 19. 8;Finally, a simple control system to maintain the air fuel ratio within the optimum range was developed using an automotive exhaust oxygen sensor. A zirconium dioxide sensor and a voltage comparator circuit was used for this purpose...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation {{is to find a}} solution to the critical problems such as the increase in friction and wear that may occur to the <b>stand-by</b> diesel <b>engine</b> for phase I units at Dr. Sharief Power Station due to engine rundown with low pressurized lubricating oil caused by the non operation of the pre-priming pump and low speed of engine mechanical oil pump. The study suggests a solution to these problems by allowing the cutting-in of pre-priming pump during engine rundown. Although the manufacturer assured the operation of the pre-priming pump during engine rundown, but it was verified that this pump failed to operate automatically or manually during the engine rundown when it was tested periodically. The relevant data for the pre-priming pump has been collected from the operating and maintenance instruction manuals for the <b>stand-by</b> diesel <b>engine</b> for phase I units at Dr. Sharief Power Station. The collected data on the existing pre-priming pump was analyzed in conformity with the manufacturer's recommendations and it was found that this pump was not following the normal operating procedure for heavy duty and high speed diesel engines. The study found that the solution for this problem is to modify the electrical stop circuit of the engine to provide the ability of automatic operation of the prepriming pump during the engine rundown. SIEMENS PLC software has been used to draw, modify and simulate the engine stop circuit and was applied properl...|$|R
