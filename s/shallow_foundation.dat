25|$|After Buckingham {{retired in}} 1676, Lady Charlotte Fitzroy, Charles II's daughter, moved in {{when she married}} Edward Lee, 1st Earl of Lichfield. The Crown {{authorised}} extensive rebuilding that included adding a storey, giving it three main floors, an attic and basement. This structure can be seen today as the rear section of Number 10. (See Plan of the Premises Granted to the Earl and Countess of Lichfield in 1677) The likely reason that repair was required is that the house had settled in the swampy ground near the Thames, causing structural damage. Like Downing Street, it rested on a <b>shallow</b> <b>foundation,</b> a design error that caused problems until 1960 when the modern Number 10 was rebuilt on deep pilings.|$|E
500|$|The {{engineering}} of the masts {{was complicated}} because stability {{was so important}} to the overall design success of the suspension structure. [...] Mast displacements could significantly alter cable length and tension and redistribute loads through the superstructure contrary to design. [...] The key to successful design was control of the foundation settlement. [...] The sites natural underlying subsurface conditions were stiff silty clay below a medium dense sand layer, which was determined to be too accommodating to settlement to host the structure. [...] Ground improvement, consisting of triple-fluid jet grouting, was performed to reduce the compressibility of the silty clay, stiffen the sand deposit and provide a desirable <b>shallow</b> <b>foundation</b> system. [...] This site marked the first time that these geotechnical ground improvement techniques were employed.|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} <b>shallow</b> <b>foundations</b> is {{becoming}} an attractive choice for supporting highway bridge structures. The settlement of structures built on soil is a subject of considerable interest to practicing engineers since excessive settlements can lead to serviceability problems or even failure states in the structural foundations. Therefore, the design of <b>shallow</b> <b>foundations</b> is most often governed by settlement requirements. ^ A reliability-based approach can be applied for designing <b>shallow</b> <b>foundations</b> for which their design needs knowledge about the distribution of settlement under a given footing. The performance of geotechnical structures, including <b>shallow</b> <b>foundations</b> depends mostly on loads and soil properties, which are the random variables described by statistical parameters. However, most of the current research efforts have {{been focused on the}} reliability models for the superstructure components with less attention paid to the substructure and foundations. The random variables and limit state functions for <b>shallow</b> <b>foundations</b> are very different from those for superstructures such as bridges or buildings. ^ The objective {{of this study is to}} develop the methodology for risk analysis procedures of <b>shallow</b> <b>foundations.</b> This requires development of the reliability models that can be applied to <b>shallow</b> <b>foundations</b> and involves the establishment of serviceability limit state functions. ^ Reliability, as it can be expressed as a measure of structural performance, is expressed in terms of reliability indices, which in this research are calculated for total and differential settlement of <b>shallow</b> bridge <b>foundations.</b> The most important part of this study is the development of statistical models for total and differential settlements of <b>shallow</b> <b>foundations</b> on cohesionless soils by Monte Carlo simulations technique. This study verifies six settlement prediction methods for spread footing foundations by using compiled field data from research projects based on vertical settlements measured on 23 sites of footings for 12 highway bridges selected in US. ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{oldest and}} tallest of the {{buildings}} is the well preserved round tower (28 metres, or 90 feet), dating from c.1100. Its entrance is [...] from the ground, necessitated by a <b>shallow</b> <b>foundation</b> (about 3 feet) typical of round towers. [...] The tower was built using the dry stone method.

2500|$|There {{are many}} reasons that a {{geotechnical}} engineer would recommend a deep foundation over a <b>shallow</b> <b>foundation,</b> such as for a skyscraper. Some of the common reasons are very large design loads, a poor soil at shallow depth, or site constraints like property lines. There are different terms used to describe different types of deep foundations including the pile (which is analogous to a [...] ), the pier (which is analogous to a column), drilled shafts, and caissons. Piles are generally driven into the ground in situ; other deep foundations are typically put in place using excavation and drilling. The naming conventions may vary between engineering disciplines and firms. Deep foundations can be made out of timber, steel, reinforced concrete or prestressed concrete.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{reason was}} that Number 10 was a {{hazardous}} place to live. Prone to sinking because it was built on soft soil and a <b>shallow</b> <b>foundation,</b> floors buckled, walls and chimneys cracked; it became unsafe and frequently required repairs. In 1766, for example, Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, {{pointed out that the}} house was in a dilapidated condition. His architect's letter to the Treasury read: [...] "...we have caused the House in Downing Street belonging to the Treasury to be surveyed, & find the Walls of the old part of the said House next the street to be much decayed, the Floors & Chimneys much sunk from the level". Townsend ordered extensive repairs, but they were still incomplete eight years later. A note from Lord North to the Office of Works, dated September 1774, asks that the work {{on the front of the}} house, [...] "which was begun by a Warrant from the Treasury dated 9 August 1766", should be finished.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a practical method {{to evaluate the}} development of failure envelopes of coastal and offshore <b>shallow</b> <b>foundations</b> after the action of multi-directional cyclic loading considering soil degradation. This is realised by implementing a soil strain softening and rate model into a finite element package and using a combined approach of load controlled geometrically nonlinear finite element analysis and displacement controlled small strain finite element analysis. The gradual evolution of soil strain softening and rate effects are monitored and utilised to update the shear strength during the analysis under multi-directional cyclic loading. The failure envelope is then investigated based on the updated shear strength field of the soil. After introducing the approach and demonstrating with an example, a systematic study is presented to explore the effects of soil strain softening and rate parameters, soil stiffness index and period of cyclic loading on load carrying capacity of coastal and offshore <b>shallow</b> <b>foundations.</b> The results show that soil degradation {{should be taken into}} account in design of coastal and offshore <b>shallow</b> <b>foundations</b> because it is detrimental to the capacity of <b>shallow</b> <b>foundations.</b> Results of the parametric analyses have shown that soil sensitivity, relative ductility and the stiffness index have more influence on capacity of <b>shallow</b> <b>foundations</b> subjected to undrained cyclic preloading than strain rate parameter and the period of cyclic loading. </p...|$|R
50|$|Karl von Terzaghi was {{the first}} to present a {{comprehensive}} theory for the evaluation of the ultimate bearing capacity of rough <b>shallow</b> <b>foundations.</b> This theory states that a <b>foundation</b> is <b>shallow</b> if its depth is {{less than or equal to}} its width. Later investigations, however, have suggested that foundations with a depth, measured from the ground surface, equal to 3 to 4 times their width may be defined as <b>shallow</b> <b>foundations.</b>|$|R
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of columns {{supporting}} the structure. As the ground level rises from the shore {{to the level of the}} Yerba Buena Tunnel, the height of the above ground portion of the columns varies. Since the rock structure supporting these is a hard shale, it would be normal under previous engineering methods to simply dig a relatively <b>shallow</b> <b>foundation</b> for each column, with the structural length varying progressively. Modern seismic analysis and computer simulations revealed the problem with such a design; while the long columns could flex several feet at the top (0.6 meter, more or less), the shorter columns were likely to break, since the rigid deck structures cause the imposition of a similar amount of motion at the tops of the columns, imposing more bending stress per unit length on the shorter columns. This problem was solved by making the columns of similar (but not uniform) length, with the [...] "shorter" [...] columns extending in permanent open shafts to deep foundations. This allows all columns of the YBITS to respond in a sufficiently uniform manner. The space between a column and its pit is covered by a protective sacrificial cover, forming a type of base isolation system at the more sensitive column locations. In addition, the western landing of the YBITS is a zero moment hinge, and so there are no vertical bending stresses at that point.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{remaining}} walls were 1 foot high or less and of dry-set flint and chalk. They were only 1 foot to 1 foot 6inches in width (with offsets) in <b>shallow</b> <b>foundation</b> trenches. The excavator thought that {{the upper part of}} the walls were probably made of wychert, a local building material still existing in some buildings particularly at Haddenham and consisting of chalk mud mixed with straw which would set very solid. The roofs may have been partly thatched but part must have been tiled, because a fair number of roofing tiles were found spread over the site. Looking at the building from the church side, the excavator thought that on the left was probably a two-storey building which would have been the accommodation reserved for the lord of the manor. The room on the first floor would have been the [...] "great chamber" [...] serving as bedroom and sitting room. The great hall probably extended in front of this part of the building towards the church, but this was not found or excavated. On the right of this room was probably the kitchen and beyond that more living accommodation, perhaps for the steward, with a smaller hall extending in front of it. This was roughly in the centre of the building. The excavator considered whether this might be the great hall but thought it probably too small. Beyond it to the right was a range of single storey rooms.|$|E
60|$|The Maldiva Archipelago is 470 {{miles in}} length, {{with an average}} breadth of about 50 miles. The form and {{dimensions}} of the atolls, and their singular position in a double line, may be seen, but not well, in the greatly reduced chart (Figure 6) in Plate II. The dimensions of the longest atoll in the group (called by the double name of Milla-dou-Madou and Tilla-dou-Matte) have already been given; it is 88 miles in a medial and slightly curved line, and is less than 20 miles in its broadest part. Suadiva, also, is a noble atoll, being 44 miles across in one direction, and 34 in another, and the great included expanse of water has a depth of between 250 and 300 feet. The smaller atolls in this group differ in no respect from ordinary ones; but the larger ones are remarkable from being breached by numerous deep-water channels leading into the lagoon; for instance, there are 42 channels, through which a ship could enter the lagoon of Suadiva. In the three southern large atolls, the separate portions of reef between these channels have the ordinary structure, and are linear; but in the other atolls, especially the more northern ones, these portions are ring- formed, like miniature atolls. Other ring-formed reefs rise out of the lagoons, {{in the place of}} those irregular ones which ordinarily occur there. In the reduction of the chart of Mahlos Mahdoo (Plate II., Figure 4), it was not found easy to define the islets and the little lagoons within each reef, so that the ring-formed structure is very imperfectly shown; in the large published charts of Tilla-dou-Matte, the appearance of these rings, from standing further apart from each other, is very remarkable. The rings on the margin are generally elongated; many of them are three, and some even five miles, in diameter; those within the lagoon are usually smaller, few being more than two miles across, and the greater number rather less than one. The depth of the little lagoon within these small annular reefs is generally from five to seven fathoms, but occasionally more; and in Ari atoll many of the central ones are twelve, and some even more than twelve fathoms deep. These rings rise abruptly from the platform or bank, on which they are placed; their outer margin is invariably bordered by living coral (Captain Moresby informs me that Millepora complanata is one of the commonest kinds on the outer margin, as it is at Keeling atoll.) within which there is a flat surface of coral rock; of this flat, sand and fragments have in many cases accumulated and been converted into islets, clothed with vegetation. I can, in fact, point out no essential difference between these little ring-formed reefs (which, however, are larger, and contain deeper lagoons than many true atolls that stand in the open sea), and the most perfectly characterised atolls, excepting that the ring-formed reefs are based on a <b>shallow</b> <b>foundation,</b> instead of {{on the floor of the}} open sea, and that instead of being scattered irregularly, they are grouped closely together on one large platform, with the marginal rings arranged in a rudely formed circle.|$|E
40|$|Liquefaction-induced {{effects are}} {{a major threat to}} <b>shallow</b> <b>foundations</b> built on {{saturated}} sand deposits, in seismically active regions. This type of structure is frequently used to support different structures, namely bridges, buildings, gravity walls, etc. Currently, there are few procedures in practice with limited scientific basis for estimation of the liquefaction-effects on foundations built on liquefiable soil. Therefore {{it is very important to}} develop more reliable predictions of the performance of <b>shallow</b> <b>foundations</b> built on liquefiable ground and, even more importantly, to develop more efficient techniques to improve that performance.

60|$|From the {{description}} now given, we must {{conclude that the}} dimensions and structure of fringing-reefs depend entirely on the greater or less inclination of the submarine slope, conjoined {{with the fact that}} reef-building polypifers can exist only at limited depths. It follows from this, that where the sea is very shallow, as in the Persian Gulf and in parts of the East Indian Archipelago, the reefs lose their fringing character, and appear as separate and irregularly scattered patches, often of considerable area. From the more vigorous growth of the coral on the outside, and from the conditions being less favourable in several respects within, such reefs are generally higher and more perfect in their marginal than in their central parts; hence these reefs sometimes assume (and this circumstance ought not to be overlooked) the appearance of atolls; but they differ from atolls in their central expanse being much less deep, in their form being less defined, and in being based on a <b>shallow</b> <b>foundation.</b> But when in a deep sea reefs fringe banks of sediment, which have accumulated beneath the surface, round either islands or submerged rocks, they are distinguished with difficulty on the one hand from encircling barrier-reefs, and on the other from atolls. In the West Indies there are reefs, which I should probably have arranged under both these classes, had not the existence of large and level banks, lying a little beneath the surface, ready to {{serve as the basis for}} the attachment of coral, been occasionally brought into view by the entire or partial absence of reefs on them, and had not the formation of such banks, through the accumulation of sediment now in progress, been sufficiently evident. Fringing-reefs sometimes coat, and thus protect the foundations of islands, which have been worn down by the surf to the level of the sea. According to Ehrenberg, this has been extensively the case with the islands in the Red Sea, which formerly ranged parallel to the shores of the mainland, with deep water within them: hence the reefs now coating their bases are situated relatively to the land like barrier-reefs, although not belonging to that class; but there are, as I believe, in the Red Sea some true barrier-reefs. The reefs of this sea and of the West Indies will be described in the Appendix. In some cases, fringing-reefs appear to be considerably modified in outline by the course of the prevailing currents. Dr. J. Allan informs me that on the east coast of Madagascar almost every headland and low point of sand has a coral-reef extending from it in a S.W. and N.E. line, parallel to the currents on that shore. I should think the influence of the currents chiefly consisted in causing an extension, in a certain direction, of a proper foundation for the attachment of the coral. Round many intertropical islands, for instance the Abrolhos on the coast of Brazil surveyed by Captain Fitzroy, and, as I am informed by Mr. Cuming, round the Philippines, the bottom of the sea is entirely coated by irregular masses of coral, which although often of large size, do not reach the surface and form proper reefs. This must be owing, either to insufficient growth, or to the absence of those kinds of corals which can withstand the breaking of the waves.|$|E
