50|$|Air line {{failure is}} {{a failure of the}} tubing which connects the air bags or struts {{to the rest of the}} air system, and is {{typically}} DOT-approved nylon air brake line. This usually occurs when the air lines, which must be routed to the air bags through the chassis of the vehicle, rub against a sharp edge of a chassis member or a moving <b>suspension</b> <b>component,</b> causing a hole to form. This mode of failure will typically take some time to occur after the initial installation of the system, as the integrity of a section of air line is compromised to the point of failure due to the rubbing and resultant abrasion of the material. An air-line failure may also occur if a piece of road debris hits an air line and punctures or tears it, although this is unlikely to occur in normal road use. It does occur in harsh off-road conditions but it still not common if correctly installed.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{operation}} of a hydraulic brake system uses the premise of fluid displacement to convert operator input into friction. This fluid transfer is accomplished by a connecting tube and/or hose from one hydraulic cylinder (often called the master cylinder) to another (located at the brakes of each wheel). In practice, an operator control such as a brake pedal or lever attached to a hydraulic cylinder is connected in turn, via a tube/hose, to another hydraulic cylinder responsible for applying friction to a moving surface. This network of operator control(s), tube/hose, and cylinder(s) is filled with hydraulic fluid such that input from the operator displaces fluid at the control location, resulting in movement {{at the opposite end}} of the system. The ideal hydraulic brake system would use only hard tubing such as galvanized or stainless steel pipe, as this would prevent any expansion along the hydraulic fluid path, providing the most direct transfer of operator input force to the friction surfaces, and in fact most of the length of a brake line is made of stainless steel. However, hard tubing will not endure the motions caused by articulation of suspension components. For example, an automobile wheel is not hard-mounted to the automobile's frame or unibody chassis. It is instead mounted to a <b>suspension</b> <b>component</b> which allows that wheel to move in response to road irregularities and steering inputs. Because the wheel must be able to move, a length of flexible hose must be used between the end of the run of metal brake line tubing, and the brake at each wheel. Since the ideal brake system would use only hard tubing for its lack of expansion, but some use of flexible hose is required, the ideal compromise is to use a hose type that allows a minimal rate of expansion. Thus the assertion that braided stainless steel hose is superior as compared to a typical rubber hose when used in a hydraulic brake system.|$|E

50|$|In 2014 Reynolds {{was again}} the pilot for the #55 Rod Nash Racing Bottle-O Falcon, {{with the car}} taking on a {{different}} look after acquiring Jim Beam Devil's Cut as the secondary sponsor replacing Canadian Club. Reynolds season again started with mix results, following a trend of poor results in the short, two race 'sprint' races but top ten results in the longer races that gave more points. This took {{a turn for the}} better after Symmons Plains where he claimed 17 top 15 results from 18 races, with an unfortunate tyre delamination in the last race in New Zealand when he was running in third place being the only omission. However, from the last race at Queensland Raceway where he qualified and finished in last place until the first race at Surfers Paradise Dean Canto and himself endured a run of terrible luck. In the first race at a drying Sydney Motorsport Park he was turned around by James Moffat at turn three and was then hit heavily by Tim Slade. The team were able to get the car out for the second race that day, but Reynolds, not known for his wet-weather driving, struggled in the treacherous conditions only managing 13th from starting 8th. In the last race where the track was dry, Reynolds was again spun around again by teammate Winterbottom {{for the second time in}} two seasons, at the same corner as he had been 2 races earlier. He collected Scott Pye on his way to heavy back end contact with the concrete wall, with both Fords out of the race and Winterbottom being given a drive-through penalty for his efforts, with the #5 eventually finishing 20th. For the Sandown 500 the Bottle-O team again tried an alternate strategy as Reynolds could only manage an 8th place qualifying position. The team would start Reynolds in the car while nearly all the other teams would start their co-drivers. This paid off as Reynolds made his way up to third position in his stint, then giving the car to Canto who maintained position. A perfectly timed safety car for their strategy looked to be putting the team on for their first podium of the season, but when getting in the car in the second driver change Reynolds tapped the accelerator, spinning the wheels of the car while it was on the air jacks. This is illegal in the V8 Supercars Championship for safety reasons, and they were given a drive through penalty, but recovered to finish 9th. The Bathurst 1000 looked to be a good weekend for the #55, as the car was in the top three in all the free practice sessions, breaking the lap record in the final Thursday practice with a 2:06.3714, over half a second quicker than Craig Lowndes' lap four years earlier. However, qualifying was a different story. Early in the session on his first flying lap Reynolds had to go slightly wide at Reid Park because of a trundling Todd Kelly. This unsettled the car enough and put it on the dirty part of the track, causing it to smash into the outside wall at over 200kph. Reynolds later stated 'I knew the car was stuffed when I saw one of the wheels roll past me'. An exclusion from the session for fellow Ford driver and eventual Bathurst winner Chaz Mostert and the #2 HRT car not taking part in the race ensued that Reynolds started the race from 24th position. Again the Bottle-O team ran an alternate strategy, pitting at different times to the cars around them. This, consistent safety cars and raw car speed left them well inside the top ten by the middle of the race, and at the red flag period on lap 61 were sitting in second position. The car continued on to lap 102, where under safety car period and running second in the race alternator problems forced them to retire. This was heartbreak for the team after a tumultuous weekend, with Dean Canto visibly upset and being comforted by the team after seeing the car stopped on Mountain Straight on the television coverage. The issues were found to not be from the crash in qualifying, but rather in the red flag period, where for over an hour the alternator was keeping the dry ice bucket used for the driver's cool suit cold while the engine was off. Hopes of rebounding at the last endurance event in Surfers Paradise were dashed when while running in the top five cars Reynolds clipped a tyre bundle in the back chicane. He drove on for a couple corners before a right front <b>suspension</b> <b>component</b> gave way and put the #55 in the fence at turn 6. Yet another retirement left Reynolds squandering in the points standings, but the car was repaired in time for the race the next day where he and Canto finished a respectable 6th. The end of the season was consistent for Reynolds, a nice change for the team. However, a decent result went begging at the final race at Phillip Island, where an unsafe release out of his pit bay resulted in contact with Jason Bright. Reynolds would have been well inside the top ten had it not have been for this, but instead finished the race 22nd. At the final round in Sydney Reynolds showed good qualifying speed, benefiting from a red flag in the qualifying session he started from third and maintained that position to achieve his first podium of the season. However, consistent heavy storms in the late afternoon of each day dropped him down the order of the following races and these races were soon red-flagged because of the treacherous conditions. Reynolds eventually finished the season a disappointing 15th after showing early promise and being a high of 8th in the championship standings. Bad luck and unfortunate accidents in high point scoring races were the downfall of his championship position in 2014.|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of <b>suspension</b> <b>component</b> with dry {{friction}} damping has been developed. It consist of an &_Omega–shaped spring wire which ends can slip in their mountings. By positioning these components under 90 degrees around the suspended object, the suspension functions in all six degrees of freedom. The <b>suspension</b> <b>component</b> will be modeled as a series connection of a spring with a coulomb damper, {{which in turn is}} in parallel with a second spring. This model will be analyzed using Hamilton’s equations of motion to deal with the non-linear phenomena. An experimental setup has been realized whereupon the suspension components are validated using hammer impulses. The observed response is an efficiently damped sinusoidal motion which turns into an undamped sinusoid with small amplitude.
