A similar step is also used in the LFR generator, where it was observed that, in practice, only few rewiring steps are necessary (Lancichinetti and Fortunato 2009).|$|R
50|$|Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A- rating, {{comparing}} the police scene {{to the bar}} scene from the previous episode, saying It’s the criminal defense equivalent of the Viktor-with-a-K con from the premiere, a web of pure fabrication that plays right into the police’s jaded worldview: People are sick; anything’s possible; it’s almost too crazy not to be real. But to seal the deal, Jimmy buys some baked goods and films Daniel sitting on them. It’s not clear {{he needed to do}} this to convince the police. Rather, as he’s gleefully recounting the scam to Kim, it seems that he takes some pleasure in humiliating the idiotic dipshit. In doing so, though, he crosses a line—he fabricates evidence. Kim’s horrified, but for Jimmy, it’s a way of being both Slippin’ Jimmy and James M. McGill, Esq. He’s keeping it isolated from Davis & Main, he assures her; strictly pro bono work. He’s trying to have the cocobolo desk and flip the <b>forbidden</b> <b>switch</b> at the same time.|$|R
40|$|This law writing {{studies and}} {{concentrates}} about settlement forms which {{is carried out}} by BPR Madani Sejahtera Abadi toward property of fiduciary guarantee pawned by debtor to another party. This research method uses empirical law writing method which focuses on society behavior (law in action), and the research needs primary data as main data besides secondary data (law substance). In article 23 section 2 Fiducia Act No. 42 / 1999 mentioned that fiducia giver is <b>forbidden</b> <b>switching,</b> pawning, or renting out to another party property which become fiduciary guarantee object which is not reservation property, unless by writing permission before to fiduciary receiver. Therefore, fiduciary giver (debtor) is <b>forbidden</b> to <b>switch</b> or pawn fiduciary guarantee property whatever the substance is. BPR Madani Sejahtera Abadi is one of BPR exists in Yogyakarta provides credit for society and where many credit agreements within fiduciary guarantee exists. Nevertheless, from the all of credit agreement within fiduciary guarantee, there’s a few of debtor pawn the property which becomes object of fiducia guarantee. Those cases, definitely, have opposed the regulation in article 23 section 2 Fiducia Act No. 42 / 1999 {{and the content of}} credit agreement written by the parties. Settelement forms which are carried out by BPR Madani Sejahtera Abadi such as by doing oral reprimand, writing reprimand, and litigation as the final settlement...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Membrane-bound ion {{pumps are}} {{involved}} in metabolic regulation, osmoregulation, cell signalling, nerve transmission and energy transduction. How the ion electrochemical gradient interacts with the scalar chemistry and how the catalytic machinery is gated to ensure high coupling efficiency are fundamental to the mechanism of action of such pumps. Transhydrogenase is a conformationally coupled proton pump linking a proton gradient to the redox reaction between NAD(H) and NADP(H). The enzyme has three components; dI binds NAD(H), dII spans the membrane and dIII binds NADP(H). Results: The first crystal structure of a transhydrogenase dI component (from Rhodospirillum rubrum) has been determined at 2. 0 Å resolution. The monomer comprises two domains. Both {{are involved in}} dimer formation, and one has a Rossmann fold that binds NAD+ in a novel mode. The two domains can adopt different conformations. In the most closed conformation, the nicotinamide ring is expelled from the cleft between the two domains and is exposed {{on the outside of}} the protein. In this conformation it is possible to dock the structure of dI/NAD+ with that of a dIII/NADP+ complex to provide the first insights into the molecular basis of the hydride-transfer step. Conclusions: Analysis of the model of the dI/dIII complex identifies residues potentially involved in dI/dIII interaction and shows how domain motion in dI results in a shift in position of the nicotinamide ring of NAD+. We propose that this movement is responsible for <b>switching</b> between the <b>forbidden</b> and allowed states for hydride transfer during proton pumping...|$|R
