25|$|The {{copyright}} law of 1993 also contained, {{similar to other}} European {{copyright law}}s, contract provisions regulating the transfer of copyrights. Contracts {{have to be in}} writing, except for contracts about the use of a work in a periodical, which may be concluded orally. <b>Shrink-wrap</b> licenses for software are allowed. The law distinguishes between exclusive and non-exclusive transfers of rights. Only patrimonial rights can be transferred, but not moral rights, the resale right, or the right to remuneration for home-copying. In any contract, only those rights explicitly mentioned are transferred, and a transfer is only considered exclusive if the contract explicitly says so. Any contract must specify for which uses the rights on a work are transferred, for which term this transfer is valid, for which territory it applies, and it must define the remuneration the author receives. If no term is specified, an author may revoke the contract after five years with six months notice. If the territory in unspecified, the contract applies only to the territory of the Russian Federation. The remuneration must in general be given {{as a percentage of the}} gross income (sale price) generated by the use of the work, if the contract does not contain a remuneration clause, government-defined minimum schedules apply. The law prohibits the transfer of rights on future works or for future methods of exploitations. Unless the contract explicitly includes a sub-licensing permission, a licensee may not transfer some or all of the licensed rights to a third party.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A new surface {{reconstruction}} method, called <b>shrink-wrapped</b> boundary face (SWBF) algorithm, {{is proposed}} for approximating the surface from {{a set of}} unorganized 3 D points. SWBF surmounts the genus- 0 spherical topology restriction of previous <b>shrink-wrapping</b> based mesh generation technique. Furthermore, SWBF is much faster since it requires only local nearest-point-search in the shrinking process. According to experiments, it is proved to be very robust and efficient for mesh generation from unorganized points cloud.

500|$|This {{theme of}} absence was {{reflected}} in the ideas produced by his long hours spent brainstorming with the band. [...] Thorgerson had noted that Roxy Music's Country Life was sold in an opaque green cellophane sleeve – censoring the cover image – and he copied the idea, concealing the artwork for Wish You Were Here in a black-coloured <b>shrink-wrap</b> (therefore making the album art [...] "absent"). [...] The concept behind [...] "Welcome to the Machine" [...] and [...] "Have a Cigar" [...] suggested the use of a handshake (an often empty gesture), and George Hardie designed a sticker containing the album's logo of two mechanical hands engaged in a handshake, to be placed on the opaque sleeve (the mechanical handshake logo would also appear on the labels of the vinyl album this time in a black and blue background). [...] The album's cover images were photographed by Aubrey 'Po' Powell, Storm's partner at the Pink Floyd design studio Hipgnosis and was inspired by the idea that people tend to conceal their true feelings, for fear of [...] "getting burned", and thus two businessmen were pictured shaking hands, one man on fire. [...] "Getting burned" [...] was also a common phrase in the music industry, used often by artists denied royalty payments. [...] Two stuntmen were used (Ronnie Rondell and Danny Rogers), one dressed in a fire-retardant suit covered by a business suit. [...] His head was protected by a hood, underneath a wig. [...] The photograph was taken at the Warner Bros. studios in Los Angeles. [...] Initially the wind was blowing in the wrong direction, and the flames were forced into Rondell's face, burning his moustache. [...] The two stuntmen changed positions, and the image was later reversed.|$|E

40|$|Hyperbolic Programming (HP) [...] {{minimizing}} {{a linear}} functional over an affine subspace of a finite-dimensional real vector space intersected {{with the so-called}} hyperbolicity cone [...] is a class of convex optimization problems that contains well-known Linear Programming (LP). In particular, for any LP one can readily provide a sequence of HP relaxations. Based on these hyperbolic relaxations, a new <b>Shrink-Wrapping</b> approach to solve LP has been proposed by Renegar. The resulting <b>Shrink-Wrapping</b> trajectories, in a sense, generalize the notion of central path in interior-point methods. We study the geometry of <b>Shrink-Wrapping</b> trajectories for Linear Programming. In particular, we analyze the geometry of these trajectories in {{the proximity of the}} so-called central line, and contrast the behavior of these trajectories with that of the central path for some pathological LP instances. In addition, we provide an elementary proof of convexity of hyperbolicity cones over reals.

2500|$|The North American promotional artwork for the game, {{designed}} by Gerald de Jesus of iam8bit, {{was meant to}} be reminiscent of the domestic cover art for the original Mega Man game. According to Capcom employee Chris Kramer, the marketing group felt that {{if they were going to}} release a game that graphically resembled one that came from 1987, it would be best to have the marketing campaign reflect that. T-shirts bearing the artwork were created for Inafune and Takeshita to wear at the game's official debut at the Electronic Entertainment Expo during the summer of 2008. The T-shirts were later made available to the public via Capcom's online store. A [...] "limited edition" [...] press kit, intended for members of the media, using that same cover art was then created by iam8bit. Being as faithful to the original 1987 release as possible, the iam8bit crew disassembled one-thousand vintage NES cartridges and inserted mini CDs inside. Though the CDs do not contain the actual game, they feature an array of screenshots, artwork, and game information. That was then packaged in a custom-created, classic-looking NES box, complete with <b>shrink-wrap</b> and bargain bin price tags. The press kit was also put on sale at Capcom's store.|$|E

40|$|The mobile workforce, which {{consists}} of employees {{that do not have}} one fixed place of work and are linked to a corporate base using a mobile computing device, is expected to grow to 75 % of the total United States workforce, or approximately 212. 1 million people, by 2015. Advances in technology, such as the increasing abundance of portable computing devices and the prevalence of wireless broadband, combined with the fact that more companies are allowing employees to use their own devices to access the enterprise, create an environment in which these workers can access corporate resources anytime, anywhere, with a myriad of devices having varying configurations. Having ubiquitous access to resources has its benefits, like increased productivity, but also creates unique challenges to ensuring appropriate security. Traditional approaches to security are not suitable for this emerging computing environment, because they are based on assumptions that no longer hold, such as well-defined situations, consistent configurations, and static contexts. For this reason, these approaches typically base security decisions on statically assigned attributes like identity or role. In the highly dynamic computing environment of mobile workers, context-aware security, in which context is utilized to allow security to adapt to the current situation, is essential. This dissertation presents our efforts to address the mismatch between traditional, context-insensitive security and this emerging dynamic computing environment with a novel security paradigm, <b>shrink-wrapped</b> security. With <b>shrink-wrapped</b> security, as the situation changes, the security changes also, providing a tight coupling between a user's current situation and security. Contributions of this dissertation include the following: *A novel security paradigm, <b>shrink-wrapped</b> security, which involves utilizing context to tightly fuse a user's situation and security. *A usable definition of security-relevant context, along with goal oriented guidelines and a corresponding taxonomy to facilitate the systematic identification of contextual attributes that are most pertinent to a security service. These contributions deal with a key challenge of context-aware system development- identifying relevant context. *A context acquisition and management framework to facilitate the development and use of <b>shrink-wrapped</b> security services for the mobile workforce. The layered architecture of this framework supports secure context acquisition and utilization by security services and was designed with the resource constraints of mobile devices in mind. *An approach based on logic programming to practically incorporate the use of security-relevant context into the security policies that govern security services. This technique is aligned with the <b>shrink-wrapped</b> security concept of utilizing a comprehensive set of relevant context, while remaining practical and manageable by abstracting relevant contextual attributes to a security level associated with the objectives of a security service. *The implementation and evaluation of <b>shrink-wrapped</b> access control, which serves as a practical demonstration of the feasibility of <b>shrink-wrapped</b> security...|$|R
