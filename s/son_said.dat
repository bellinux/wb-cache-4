5|$|Although {{the first}} {{municipal}} council of Gaza {{was formed in}} 1893 under the chairmanship of Ali Khalil Shawa, modern mayorship began in 1906 with his <b>son</b> <b>Said</b> al-Shawa, who was appointed mayor by Ottoman authorities.

5|$|The first {{municipal}} council of Gaza {{was formed in}} 1893 under the chairmanship of Ali Khalil Shawa. Modern mayorship, however, began in 1906 with his <b>son</b> <b>Said</b> al-Shawa, who was appointed mayor by the Ottoman authorities. Al-Shawa oversaw the construction of Gaza's first hospital, several new mosques and schools, {{the restoration of the}} Great Mosque, and the introduction of the modern plow to the city. In 1922, British colonial secretary Winston Churchill requested that Gaza develop its own constitution under Mandatory Palestine. However, it was rejected by the Palestinians.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Jackson {{was accused}} {{of child sexual abuse}} by Evan Chandler, on behalf of his then-13-year-old child, Jordan Chandler. To the father's disapproval and concern, his son had become friends with the {{musician}} in May 1992. Allegedly under the influence of a controversial sedative administered by Evan Chandler, a dentist, his <b>son</b> <b>said</b> that Jackson had touched his penis. Evan Chandler was tape-recorded threatening to damage the singer's music career, and engaged Jackson in unsuccessful negotiations to resolve the issue with a financial settlement. Jordan Chandler then told a psychiatrist and later police that he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral sex. Jackson settled a civil suit out of court with the Chandler family and their legal team for $22,000,000 in January 1994. After Jordan Chandler refused to testify in the criminal proceedings, the state closed its criminal investigation citing lack of evidence, and Jackson was not charged with a crime. Jordan Chandler later admitted to lying. After Jackson's death, Evan Chandler committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|The Fringe team {{is brought}} to a nursing home, where Roscoe Joyce (Christopher Lloyd), the former keyboardist of the band Violet Sedan Chair, was seen talking to his son Bobby (Nick Ouellette) {{who had died in}} 1985, as well as {{evidence}} of an Observer. Walter Bishop (John Noble), meeting his musical hero, requests to take Roscoe back to his lab to help Roscoe remember what his <b>son</b> <b>said.</b> Walter is able to help Roscoe remember much of his past since the loss of his son through therapy that includes helping Roscoe to recall his piano-playing skills. Roscoe shortly recalls the conversation with his son, which was actually a message from the Observer September to Walter. September (Michael Cerveris) soon appears at the lab and requests to speak to Walter.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Son,</b> <b>said</b> Cristóbal Díaz, is {{the most}} {{important}} genre of Cuban music, and the least studied. It can fairly be said that son is to Cuba what the tango is to Argentina, or the samba to Brazil. In addition, it is perhaps the most flexible of all forms of Latin-American music. Its great strength is its fusion between European and African musical traditions. Its most characteristic instruments are the Cuban instrument known as the tres, and the well-known double-headed bongó; these are present from the start to the present day. Also typical are the claves, the Spanish guitar, the double bass (replacing the early botija or marímbula), early on the cornet or trumpet and finally the piano.|$|E

500|$|In {{a motion}} {{sent to the}} prosecutor, the boy's court-appointed lawyer, and reporters, Thompson asked to be {{recognized}} as the boy's lawyer in the case. Medina County Prosecutor Dean Holman, however, said Thompson would be faced with deeply conflicting interests if he were to represent Dustin Lynch because he also advised Mishne's parents. Claiming that delays had weakened his case, Thompson asked Medina County Common Pleas Judge Christopher Collier to disqualify himself from presiding over the case because the judge had not ruled on Thompson's request for two months. The boy himself eventually rejected Thompson's offer, withdrawing his insanity plea. Lynch's mother, Jerrilyn Thomas, who had demanded that Collier appoint Thompson to defend her <b>son,</b> <b>said</b> she changed her mind after visiting with her son in jail, saying that the charge against him [...] "has nothing to do with video games or Paxil, and my son's no murderer." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Forbes {{formed a}} laager (improvised fort) about [...] from the {{southern}} bank. There, he interrogated a captive Matabele, {{the son of an}} inDuna (tribal leader), who said that the king was indeed where Wilson had gone, and was ill (the exact ailment was not known for sure, the prisoner said, but was suspected to be gout). The inDunas <b>son</b> <b>said</b> that Lobengula had with him a force of about 3,000 warriors, about half of whom were armed with Martini-Henry rifles. They were mixed together from various regiments of the previously routed Matabele army, and largely demoralised, but still fiercely determined to prevent Lobengula's capture. Most prominent were the Imbezu, Ingubo and Insukameni Regiments; the Imbezu, Lobengula's favourite, was generally considered the strongest. After three weeks in pursuit of the king, Forbes's rations were running perilously short. He therefore resolved to attack the next day (4 December), hoping to be able to turn back for Bulawayo with Lobengula in custody before nightfall.|$|E

[...] He soon became the pastor and overseer of the Brethren meeting, at first over a stable but shortly, under Gosse's preaching and peacemaking, in finer quarters—which he perhaps financed himself.

2500|$|During {{the last}} years of his work on the X-Files, Mulder was even forced to doubt that Bill was his true father.

The possibility was hinted at later in the series, and Jeffrey Spender, who certainly was the Smoking Man's <b>son,</b> <b>said</b> that Mulder was his half-brother. In the ninth season, [...] "William" [...] explains that Spender and Mulder have very similar DNA, providing strong evidence that they do have the same father.|$|E
2500|$|Steinbeck complained {{publicly}} about government harassment. Thomas Steinbeck, the author's eldest <b>son,</b> <b>said</b> that J.

According to Thomas, a true artist is one who [...] "without a thought for self, stands up against the stones of condemnation, and speaks {{for those who are}} given no real voice in the halls of justice, or the halls of government. By doing so, these people will naturally become the enemies of the political status quo." ...|$|E
