50|$|Boni (Hindustani: बोहनी or بوﮨنی) is {{a social}} and {{commercial}} custom of North India and Pakistan {{that is based on}} the belief that the first sale of a day (or other selling period) establishes the seller's luck for subsequent choti transactions during the remainder of the day. In practical terms this means that sellers try to ensure that the first (or bohni) sale happens on a cash-only basis, and ideally without any discounts (i.e. at full-price), though the <b>social</b> <b>protocol</b> associated with bohni sales varies by region. Unless the price is egregious, it is considered good manners for customers to be generous if they are engaged in a bohni transaction with the seller. If the buyer is trusted, the seller will sometimes allow the buyer to state a price that is binding on both, with the expectation that the buyer will demonstrate generosity.|$|E

Butt's housemate and friend Francis Davis Millet (himself one of Taft's circle) asked Taft to give him a leave of absence to recuperate before the presidential primaries began. Taft agreed and ordered Butt to go on vacation. Butt was on no official business, but anti-Catholic newspapers and politicians accused Butt of being on a secret mission to win the support of Pope Pius X in the upcoming election. Butt did intend to meet with Pius, and he carried with him a personal letter from Taft. But the letter merely thanked the pope for elevating three Americans to the rank of cardinal, and asked what the <b>social</b> <b>protocol</b> was for greeting them at functions.|$|E

As a function of the painting, the protocol of religious symbolism supersedes the <b>social</b> <b>protocol</b> for a wedding banquet; thus, the disparity of status, between the celebrants and the guests: Jesus, Mary, and some of his Apostles sit at the centre span of the banquet table, whilst the bride and bridegroom sit at {{the right wing of the}} banquet table. Moreover, despite the continuing preparation of roasted-meat, the main course of a meal, the guests appear to be eating the dessert course of the meal, given that the foods on the table include fruits and quince cheese, a comestible symbol of marriage; such a culinary contradiction indicates that the animals are symbolic and not for eating.|$|E

50|$|In 1764, {{shortly after}} the Seven Years' War had ended, he {{travelled}} to London (landing at Harwich) to marry Princess Augusta. He received a rapturous welcome from the British people, thanks to his service with allied British troops during the war. The Parliament of Great Britain showed its gratitude by voting him a lump sum of £80,000 and an annual income of £3,000 as a wedding gift. However George III was less welcoming, and sought to express his displeasure through numerous small insults e.g. by lodging the prince at Somerset House, instead {{of one of the}} royal palaces; not providing him with a military guard; and instructing the servants at the wedding to wear old clothes. This merely served to exacerbate the enthusiasm of the public, particularly when the prince was suspected of turning his back on the unpopular monarch whilst attending an opera (a breach of <b>social</b> <b>protocol).</b> Charles William Ferdinand defied royal displeasure by meeting William Pitt the Elder (who had been prime minister during the war but resigned in 1761) and the other leaders of the parliamentary opposition. The wedding was completed, but {{as a result of these}} machinations the prince remained in Britain for only thirteen days.|$|E
5000|$|The ETUC regards {{collective}} bargaining and social dialogue, and workplace and industrial democracy as key to innovation, productivity and growth in Europe. It therefore promotes capacity building for trade unions across Europe.The social {{dialogue between the}} ETUC and European employers supplements the national social dialogues in the Member States. The ETUC supports European Works Councils, and workers’ consultation and participation in decision-making.EU cross-industry social dialogue was formally launched in 1985, {{with the support of}} former Commission President Jacques Delors. It has evolved through three stages:I - (1985-1991) Bipartite activities culminated in the adoption of resolutions, declarations and common opinions, which did not have binding effect. II - (1992-1999) An accord between the social partners, signed on 31 October 1991 and subsequently annexed to the 1992 Maastricht Treaty {{in the form of a}} <b>Social</b> <b>Protocol,</b> enabled European social partner agreements to have legal force through a Council decision. In 1997, the agreement was written into the Treaty of Amsterdam (Articles 154 and 155 TFEU).European social dialogue led to the implementation of three framework agreements (parental leave in 1995 - revised in 2009, part-time work in 1997, and fixed-term contracts in 1999) via EU Directives.III - (1999-2005) In December 2001, the European social partners presented a [...] "common contribution" [...] to the Laeken European Council. In accordance with the 1991 agreement (Art. 155 par 2 TFEU), this moved towards greater independence and autonomy of the social dialogue.Since 2002, the social partners have concluded autonomous agreements on:• telework (2002)• work-related stress (2004)• harassment and violence at work (2007)• inclusive labour markets (2010)• a framework of actions for the lifelong development of competencies and qualifications (2002), a framework of actions on gender equality (2005), and a framework of actions on youth employment (2013). These are implemented by the social partners themselves at national, regional and enterprise level. The social partners' new Multiannual Work Programme runs until 2017 and foresees an accord on active ageing.In the field of {{collective bargaining}} and wage policy, the ETUC has coordinated affiliates’ activities since 1999. From 2012, the ETUC also started to coordinate trade union participation in EU economic governance and the Semester process. Every year the ETUC updates its priorities and initiatives on industrial relations and wage developments, with a view to improving working and living conditions across Europe, to achieve better wages for all workers, ensure equal treatment, combat inequalities, support capacity building for sound industrial relations and promote collective bargaining in all EU countries.The ETUC favours a holistic approach to workers’ involvement, including stronger information and consultation rights, board-level participation in European company forms, and support for European Works Councils. The ETUC presses for information and consultation for workers, in particular to anticipate change or company restructuring (to cut job losses), and throughout the subcontracting chain.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the recent}} years, MySpace has been vital to {{fostering}} {{the growth of}} independent musicians’ followings and have played critical roles in helping mainstream artists maintain fan communities. The popularity of MySpace {{has been accompanied by}} the establishment of <b>social</b> <b>protocols</b> which allow musicians to network with one another in an efficient and successful way. These protocols have inspired the publication of various books (such as «MySpace Music Profit Monster!: Proven Online Marketing Strategies!» by Nicky Kalliongis devoted to providing tips and strategies for musicians. While some of these protocols pertain to being savvy with the technological aspect of MySpace, other protocols are directly related to learning a particular manner to network on MySpace. Furthermore, these practices are considered a serious work as they require {{a lot of time and}} networking skills to achieve a certain level of success, i. e. increasing the number of friends on one’s network. Thus, this article examines the emerging <b>social</b> <b>protocols</b> on MySpace as a form of affective and immaterial labor. The author argues that the implementation of various tips as provided by MySpace expert will possibly have a regressive effect on musicians’ social networking practices as these could become a standardized and repetitive practice.

With an increasingly wide adoption of the project-oriented management, new models are needed for ERP systems to support the management of enterprise resources in a project-oriented manner. This paper presents an architecture of an ERP system supporting project-oriented management. Two characteristics of the project-oriented management are integrated in the proposed architec-ture: first, <b>social</b> <b>protocols</b> are used to model interactions between actors (humans or software agents) within a given group.
