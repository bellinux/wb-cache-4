5|$|Alec Baldwin as Jack Donaghy is the decisive, controlling, suave, and {{occasionally}} <b>senseless</b> network executive who constantly {{interferes with the}} goings-on at TGS.|$|E
5|$|The music, {{philosophy}} and lifestyle of heavy metal bands and fans were often panned by both left-wing critics and conservative public opinion, described as <b>senseless,</b> ridiculous {{to the limit}} of self-parody, and even dangerous for the young generation. The 1984 mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap addressed many idiosyncrasies of British metal bands, showing comic sides of that world which external observers would judge absurd. Instead metal musicians regarded the movie's content as much too real.|$|E
5|$|Trying to {{sort out}} what has happened, Hermie goes back to Dorothy's house. Dorothy has fled the island {{in the night and}} an {{envelope}} is tacked to the front door with Hermie's name on it. Inside is a note from Dorothy, saying she hopes he understands she must go back home as there is much to do. She assures Hermie she will never forget him, and he will find his way of remembering what happened that night. Her note closes with the hope that Hermie may be spared the <b>senseless</b> tragedies of life.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Milhouse torment {{a tourist}} named Howell Huser (a parody of {{television}} personality Huell Howser), who is then chased {{out of town}} by bullies Dolph, Jimbo, and Kearney. Huser is later revealed to be a media personality, and he appears on a network's morning television show warning tourists against visiting Springfield and giving it his lowest rating for any American location (six out of ten). The Springfield tourism business collapses and Mayor Quimby holds an emergency meeting at the town hall. After many <b>senseless</b> suggestions, Lisa suggests that Springfield legalize same-sex marriage to entice visitors to their town. All of Springfield happily agrees with Lisa's idea, even Marge. The town makes a commercial that is broadcast throughout America, convincing {{people to come to}} Springfield.|$|E
5|$|Samoa Joe {{defended his}} TNA X Division Championship against Christopher Daniels at Final Resolution. TNA {{promoted}} this match for Final Resolution on the January7, 2006 episode of Impact!. Joe won the contest after A.J. Styles threw {{in the towel}} for Daniels due to Joe beating Daniels <b>senseless</b> in the storyline. The rivalry continued at Against All Odds, where Daniels, Joe, and Styles competed in a Three Way match for the TNA X Division Championship; Joe gained the pinfall to retain the title. The three competed again at TNA's Destination X PPV event on March12, 2006, but this time in a Three Way Ultimate X match for the championship. Daniels won the bout, thus becoming the new TNA X Division Champion. The rivalry ended on the April13, 2006 episode of Impact! when Joe defeated Daniels to win back the championship.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on January 4, 1974—around {{the time that}} he {{terminated}} his relationship with Brooks—Bundy entered the basement apartment of 18-year-old Karen Sparks (identified as Joni Lenz, Mary Adams or Terri Caldwell by various sources), a dancer and student at UW. After bludgeoning the sleeping woman <b>senseless</b> with a metal rod from her bed frame, he sexually assaulted her with either the same rod, or a metal speculum, causing extensive internal injuries. She remained unconscious for 10 days, but survived with permanent disabilities. Less than a month later, {{in the early morning hours}} of February 1, Bundy broke into the basement room of Lynda Ann Healy, a UW undergraduate who broadcast morning radio weather reports for skiers. He beat her unconscious, dressed her in blue jeans, a white blouse, and boots, and carried her away.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenges}} and quests {{were developed to}} keep players occupied while playing through the story. Molyeux told Leach about the ways {{of good and evil}} and the system's reflection of the player's behaviour, and provided him with a digital copy of the Bible with instructions to study the concepts due to their connection with gods and men. Leach decided to supplement the idea of evil with mischief, as he thought being completely evil by annoying or killing followers was <b>senseless.</b> Molyneux wanted a conflict between good and evil, and for the enemy gods to have the opposite alignment to the player. As a method of introducing the player to miracles and combat, a god whose alignment {{is the same as the}} player's was added.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} the news of a fight {{circulating}} at a diner. This scene repeats itself at a pool hall, where gang members arrive via foot, forklift, and out of sewers, while the video's titular song begins to play. The camera cuts to a scene of Jackson lying on a bed, revealing he's the one singing contemplating the <b>senseless</b> violence. The singer notices rival gangs and leaves. Michael Jackson dons a red leather J. Parks brand jacket, and dances his way towards the fight through the diner and pool hall. A knife fight is taking place between the two gang leaders in a warehouse. They dance battle for an interlude of music until MJ arrives; the singer breaks up the fight and launches into a dance routine. The video ends with the gang members joining him in the dance, agreeing that violence is not the solution to their problems.|$|E
5|$|Also {{noting the}} unachievable {{ambition}} {{of solving the}} conflict between naturalism and religion, Martin A Greenman, remarks that one must come to the book “with a certain mood”. Too critical a mood would blind the reader to its religious insights, while the sensitivity and depth of its philosophic insights would be lost {{if one were to}} approach it in a too enthusiastically religious mood. Greenman finishes by justifying Stace’s philosophy to logical positivists by quoting from Wittgenstein's Tractatus: “My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as <b>senseless,</b> when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them….He must surmount these propositions: then he sees the world rightly” (6. 54.) Dorothy M. Emmet found issue with the notion that the mystical experience is the point of intersection between the temporal and eternal orders. She writes that there are difficulties in Stace defining these orders as two distinct “orders of being”, rather than just as a way of speaking, because this then means some statements about the temporal order are relevant to what is said about the eternal order and vice versa. Indeed, the interrelation between these two orders is difficult to maintain. She also questioned Stace’s characterisation of mystical consciousness as being the same everywhere.|$|E
5|$|Keith Park, with {{endorsement}} from Dowding, {{opted for}} the opposite strategy. Park maintained that it was unimportant to inflict large losses on the Germans in comparison to safeguarding his own forces. Park believed the Germans would give up if they could not achieve their aim of air superiority. This, simply put, meant avoiding the destruction and or depletion of Fighter Command was the primary factor in air defence. This would be achieved by sending small numbers of fighters to intercept, minimising losses in the air. By remaining to offer undiminished and constant air opposition, the RAF ensured the Luftwaffe could not win. As long {{as some sort of}} cost was imposed before the enemy dropped his bombs and impaired the defence system, the RAF could remain intact to meet the threat again the next day. To this end, Park favoured the 10 bomber kills before the attack, rather than the 50 shot down after it. The strategy suggested an enemy would give up if he felt he was getting nowhere. For even while his losses remained moderate, it would be <b>senseless</b> to suffer those casualties for no return. Park and Dowding's strategy, under the circumstances, was the wiser choice.|$|E
5|$|On June 2, 1900, {{during the}} British march on Pretoria, Burnham was wounded, almost fatally. He {{was on a}} mission to cut off the flow of Boer gold and {{supplies}} to and from the sea and to halt the transportation of British prisoners of war out of the Pretoria. He scouted alone far to the east behind enemy lines trying to identify the best choke point along the Pretoria-Delagoa Bay railway line. He came upon an underpass of a railway bridge, an ideal location to disrupt the trains, but was immediately surrounded by a party of Boers. Burnham instantly fled and he had almost escaped when his horse was shot and fell, knocking him <b>senseless</b> and pinning him under its dead body. It was night and he was already far away when his horse was shot, so the Boer troopers apparently did not check to see if Burnham had been injured or killed. When he awoke hours later, Burnham was alone and in a dazed state having sustained serious injuries. In spite of his acute agony, Burnham proceeded to creep back to the railway, placed his charges, and blew up the line in two places. He then crept {{on his hands and knees}} to an empty animal enclosure to avoid capture and stayed there for two days and nights insensible. The next day, Burnham heard fighting in the distance so he crawled in that direction. By this time he was indifferent as to the source of the gunshots and by chance it was a British patrol that found him. Once in Pretoria the surgeons discovered that Burnham had torn apart his stomach muscles and burst a blood-vessel. His very survival was due only to the fact that he had been without food or water for three days.|$|E
25|$|While many locals {{were shocked}} by the <b>senseless</b> killing, others rallied to Ison's defense. About 100 locals {{attended}} Ison's bond hearing and offered to help pay his bond.|$|E
25|$|Patients with TSA {{typically}} exhibit paraphasia; {{their speech}} is fluent but often error-prone. Their speech is often unintelligible as {{they tend to}} use the wrong words, e.g. tree instead of train or uses words in <b>senseless</b> and incorrect combinations.|$|E
25|$|On 21 August 1906 Joseph Hunter, a Greymouth wharf labourer, {{was badly}} injured working No. 2 hold. A heavy chain sling was thrown down, {{striking}} {{him on the}} head and knocking him <b>senseless.</b> He sustained nasty cuts on the head and face.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, RTS {{issued a}} written apology to the {{citizens}} of Serbia and former Yugoslavia for its actions during the regime of Slobodan Milošević and the break up of Yugoslavia. The letter apologises for the network’s <b>senseless</b> reporting and the hurt it caused to the public. It vows never to let history repeat itself.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the motives}} for the killings seemed political, some {{scholars}} argue that the events were caused by a state of panic and political uncertainty. Part of the anti-Communist force that {{was responsible for the}} massacres were made up of members of the criminal underworld, given permission to engage in <b>senseless</b> acts of violence. Other motives have been explored, such as running amok or an allusion to Javanese puppet-play (wayang).|$|E
25|$|Another is a 2012 horror anime {{television}} series produced by P.A.Works {{and directed by}} Tsutomu Mizushima, {{based on the novel}} of the same name written by Yukito Ayatsuji. The series focuses on a boy named Kōichi Sakakibara who, upon transferring into Yomiyama Middle School and meeting the curious Mei Misaki, finds himself in a mystery revolving around students and people related to his class facing gruesome and <b>senseless</b> deaths.|$|E
25|$|The {{murder of}} the pacifist Overhill chiefs under a flag of truce angered the entire Cherokee nation. Men who had been {{reluctant}} to participate took to the warpath. The increase in hostility lasted for several months. Doublehead, Corntassel's brother, was particularly incensed. Not only did the Cherokee from the Overhill Towns join those from the Lower Towns on the warpath, so too did {{a large number of}} Muscogee warriors, outraged at the <b>senseless</b> murders.|$|E
25|$|If I were to {{say that}} the {{so-called}} philosophy of this fellow Hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most <b>senseless,</b> thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, I should be quite right.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} chapter, Alex finds himself halfheartedly {{preparing}} {{for yet another}} night of crime with a new gang (Lenn, Rick, Bully). After a chance encounter with Pete, who has reformed and married, Alex finds himself taking less and less pleasure in acts of <b>senseless</b> violence. He begins contemplating giving up crime himself to become a productive member of society and start a family of his own, while reflecting {{on the notion that}} his own children will be just as destructive as he has been, if not more so.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in the novel, the titular Labours are not {{undertaken}} by Poirot as cases, but rather {{refer to a}} series of paintings that are stolen by Marrascaud, the main villain; the title is also symbolic of Poirot's path to redemption after his plan to snare Marrascaud leads to the <b>senseless</b> murder of an innocent girl, Lucinda LeMesurier. The most significant departure from the source material is the change in Marrascaud's identity; in the book it is Gustave who is Marrascaud, but in the adaptation it is Alice Cunningham, with Gustave being her accomplice (along with Dr Lutz).|$|E
25|$|You {{are asking}} me to „voluntarily {{surrender}} the fortress; otherwise you will be corrected in front of God and humanity“. What a beautiful and humane sentence? Do you believe in God? I doubt that you believe in Him and that love humanity, if you would, then you wouldn't lead his unfortunate soldiers right here to a <b>senseless</b> slaughter, and to certain death, {{and you would have}} spared them, their wives and children, and made them to live quietly at home instead of having led them such a distance because of the pernicious whims of your king.|$|E
25|$|On 31 December 1937, Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon {{proclaimed the}} {{language}} based on Tagalog as the Philippine National Language. Zoilo Hilario propose to standardize Kapampangan orthography. Being {{a member of}} the Institute of National Language (INL), Hilario sought to adopt the ABAKADA used in Tagalog and impose it as the Kapampangan language's standard orthographic system. This legal imposition of Tagalog as the Philippine National Language whereby all other Philippine languages, including Kapampangan, were placed in a subordinate position to Tagalog. The <b>senseless</b> conflict between the so-called purists and antipurists that plagued the Tagalog literary scene also found its way among Kapampangan writers.|$|E
25|$|Kimura {{had already}} decided not to defend Rangoon, but to {{evacuate}} the city and withdraw to Moulmein in southern Burma. Although he received orders from Field Marshal Hisaichi Terauchi, commander-in-chief of the Southern Expeditionary Army Group, to hold Rangoon to the death, he reasoned that this would involve the <b>senseless</b> destruction of his remaining forces. Kimura was opposed by his Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Shinichi Tanaka, who had issued orders to fortify positions in Rangoon. Ba Maw, the Prime Minister of the nominally independent Burmese government, dissuaded the Japanese from turning the Shwedagon Pagoda into a gun emplacement.|$|E
25|$|The Book {{describes}} how {{after a long}} period of peace and prosperity, carelessness and excesses within the society make people forget self responsibility, and the need to follow or protect dharma. Infighting between good people begins, ultimately leading to the destruction of the Yadava dynasty. The end comes through a <b>senseless</b> but brutal internecine war, described as a drunken fight, which kills all the Yadavas along with Krishna's human form. The last chapter describes Krishna's ascent to Vaikuntha. Book eleven also includes the so-called Uddhava Gita, the last discourse of Krishna which he addresses to Uddhava. Book 11 section 7-9 discusses the pastimes and realizations of an Avadhuta.|$|E
25|$|Although {{his army}} had been badly mauled, Van Dorn escaped completely, evading Union troops sent by Grant later on October 5 at the Battle of Hatchie's Bridge, and marching to Holly Springs, Mississippi. He {{attributed}} his defeat {{to the failure}} of Hébert to open the second-day engagement on time, but nevertheless he was replaced by Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton immediately after the battle. There were widespread outcries of indignation throughout the South over the <b>senseless</b> casualties at Corinth. Van Dorn requested a court of inquiry to answer charges that he had been drunk on duty at Corinth and that he had neglected his wounded on the retreat. The court cleared him of all blame by unanimous decision.|$|E
25|$|Hence in {{accordance}} with the natural karmic laws, consequences occur when one utters a lie, steals something, commits acts of <b>senseless</b> violence or leads the life of a debauchee. Rather than assume that moral rewards and retribution are the work of a divine judge, the Jains believe that there is an innate moral order to the cosmos, self-regulating through the workings of karma. Morality and ethics are important, not because of the personal whim of a fictional god, but because a life that is led in agreement with moral and ethical principles is beneficial: it leads to a decrease and finally to the total loss of karma, which means: to ever increasing happiness.|$|E
25|$|Yes, I suppose. The {{violence}} {{served a}} therapeutic purpose. It's unsettling {{to think that}} at any moment life can flare up into <b>senseless</b> violence. But it can and does, and {{people need to be}} ready for it. What you make for others is first of all what you make for yourself. If I’m persuaded that our life is predicated upon violence, that the entire structure of what we call civilization, the scaffolding that we’ve built up over the millennia, can collapse at any moment, then whatever I write is going to be affected by that assumption. The process of life presupposes violence, in the plant world the same as the animal world. But among the animals only man can conceptualize violence. Only man can enjoy the idea of destruction.|$|E
25|$|The Tale of the Indians resumes: Isidora {{returns to}} her family, but she is {{pregnant}} with Melmoth's child. She has a presentiment that she will not live, and gets Melmoth to promise that the child will be raised as a Christian. Isidora's father finds a husband for her, {{but in the middle}} of the wedding celebrations, Melmoth tries to abduct Isidora. Her brother tries to intervene, and Melmoth kills him. Isidora falls <b>senseless</b> and Melmoth escapes. Isidora reveals that she is already married, to Melmoth. She gives birth, but she and her baby daughter are imprisoned by the Inquisition. The inquisitors threaten to take away the child, but find that it is already dead. Isidora, dying of grief, remembers her island paradise, and asks if 'he' will be in the heavenly paradise.|$|E
25|$|The band {{were not}} {{satisfied}} with the results, which they felt lacked personality, perhaps because of the reliance on session musicians. This led to the most dramatic change of style the band would attempt, when they teamed up with Giorgio Moroder, dropped the rock-group format altogether and produced the disco record No.1 in Heaven which relied on synthesizers. This album is regarded as a landmark in the development of electronic music and greatly influenced bands which would emerge in the following years. They soon returned to a more traditional line-up, which remained until 1988's Interior Design. There then followed a long hiatus until 1994's Gratuitous Sax & <b>Senseless</b> Violins, which was a foray into the techno dance world, which they had helped to spawn back in the late 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Thus, Deleuze {{at times}} refers to his {{philosophy}} as a transcendental empiricism (empirisme transcendantal), alluding to Kant and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. In Kant's transcendental idealism, experience {{only makes sense}} when organized by forms of sensibility (namely, space, and time) and intellectual categories (such as causality). Assuming the content of these forms and categories to be qualities {{of the world as}} it exists independently of our perceptual access, according to Kant, spawns seductive but <b>senseless</b> metaphysical beliefs (for example, extending the concept of causality beyond possible experience results in unverifiable speculation about a first cause). Deleuze inverts the Kantian arrangement: experience exceeds our concepts by presenting novelty, and this raw experience of difference actualizes an idea, unfettered by our prior categories, forcing us to invent new ways of thinking (see below, Epistemology).|$|E
25|$|First of all, {{the law of}} the pursuer only {{applies to}} a {{spontaneous}} act, whereas Yigal Amir planned this assassination for two years. Secondly, {{the law of the}} pursuer is only intended to save a potential victim from imminent death. There is absolutely no proof that withdrawing from certain territories will directly lead to the death of any Jews. On the contrary, Prime Minister Rabin, over half the members of the Knesset, and over half the population of Israel believe exactly the opposite—that it will save Jewish lives. Lastly, this law does not refer to elected representatives, for if Yitzhak Rabin was really a pursuer, then so are all his followers and that would mean that Amir should have killed over half the population of Israel! In other words, even according to the law of the pursuer, this act was totally futile and <b>senseless</b> since the peace process will continue.|$|E
25|$|Despite setbacks, Snow and Emma {{get back}} to Storybrooke. However, Cora and Hook follow after them, framing Regina for the faked murder of Archie to draw {{her back to the}} darkness. Mr. Gold calls in the favor Emma owes him. Emma and Henry {{accompany}} Gold to Manhattan, where it's discovered Emma's ex-lover, Neal, is Gold's son. In Storybrooke, Cora and Regina trick Snow and David into giving them the Dark One dagger; however, Hook followed Gold to Manhattan and poisoned him. With Gold dying, Snow decides to use a magic candle to give him Cora's life to save her family from the evil woman. Regina tries seeking revenge, but is convinced by Henry not to as it would perpetuate nothing more than a <b>senseless</b> cycle of murder and revenge. Seeing Regina is prone to giving into her evil side, everyone decides to keep the magic beans they're growing a secret, so they can leave her behind in Storybrooke and head back to the Enchanted Forest.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, the United States {{was happy}} and prosperous {{in various ways}} (leading to the {{nickname}} Roaring Twenties), but it also suffered from rapid change and social tensions. Some people were disenchanted by, and alienated from, the outside world. Many common people believed that World War I had resulted in extensive and largely <b>senseless</b> carnage, and they supported isolationism for the US. According to scholar Peter Rollins (1976), Rogers {{appeared to be an}} anchor of stability; his conventional home life and traditional moral code reminded people of a recent past. His newspaper column, which ran from 1922 to 1935, expressed his traditional morality and his belief that political problems were not as serious as they sounded. In his films, Rogers began by playing a simple cowboy; his characters evolved to explore the meaning of innocence in ordinary life. In his last movies, Rogers explores a society fracturing into competing classes from economic pressures. Throughout his career, Rogers was a link to a better, more comprehensible past.|$|E
25|$|Shortly afterwards, the Prussian Cavalry having rallied, and reformed, {{in their}} turn began to drive back the French. Again {{the thunder of}} their hoofs approached, and again the flying host whirled past the Marshal and his anxious friend; whereupon the latter, eagerly {{watching}} his opportunity as the pursuers came on, darted forward, and seizing the bridle of a noncommissioned officer of the 6th Uhlans, named Schneider, ordered him and some Files immediately following, to dismount and assist in saving Blücher. Five or six powerful men now raised the heavy dead charger, while others extricated their commander, <b>senseless</b> and almost immoveable. In this state they placed him on the noncommissioned officer's horse. Just as they moved off, the French was again pressing forward with renewed speed, and Nostitz had barely time to lead the Marshal, whose senses were gradually returning, to the nearest Prussian infantry, which gladly received the party, and, retiring in perfect order, bade defiance to the attacks of its pursuers.|$|E
25|$|The {{poor quality}} of the crew {{came to the fore}} on 21 June when Hippomene was {{cruising}} off Antigua. Taking advantage of Hippomenes Dutch design, Mackenzie had disguised her as a Guinea trader. A Guadeloupe privateer, the Buonaparte, of 18 long 8-pounders and a crew of 146 men, sighted Hippomenes and sailed to take her. The two vessels exchanged fire until Buonaparte ran into Hippomenes. Mackenzie had his crew lash the privateer's bowsprit to the mainmast and jumped on board the privateer, followed by his officers and a few men, some 18 in all. Unfortunately, {{the rest of the crew}} remained behind. In the fight on the privateer, the British lost five dead and eight wounded; only nine of the original 18 managed to escape back to Hippomenes (two officers and two men remained on board Buonaparte as prisoners). The boarding party barely got back in time before the lashings gave way and the vessels parted, at which time the privateer sailed away. On Hippomenes his wounds rendered Mackenzie himself <b>senseless</b> for a while. In the engagement prior to the boarding, the Buonaparte had lost five dead and 15 wounded.|$|E
