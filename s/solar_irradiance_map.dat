The objective of this thesis is to investigate the photovoltaic potential on roof areas that the city possesses and to further investigate some buildings of the Property Management Department. The thesis also compares some existing photovoltaic plants with the <b>solar</b> <b>irradiance</b> <b>map</b> which shows available roof area on each building in Stockholm. The report ends with a literature study about the climate impact and greenhouse gas emissions of photovoltaic. The total available roof area suitable for photovoltaic plants is estimated to 700 000 m 2, with a potential electricity production of 110 GWh per year. This corresponds to 17 % of the City of Stockholm’s yearly electricity consumption. A selection of sport facilities and fire stations owned by the Property Management Department has been investigated and 13 of the 33 buildings have roof areas which are well suited for photovoltaics. The potential electricity production from these buildings is estimated to 1 050 MWh per year. The 5 existing plants investigated occupies on average 49 % of the roof area which is available according to the <b>solar</b> <b>irradiance</b> <b>map.</b> In a life cycle perspective, photovoltaics purchased on the global market are expected to cause greenhouse gas emissions of 45 g CO 2 -eq/kWh...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn its {{long-term}} energy strategy, the tropical island of Mauritius does {{not plan to}} fully exploit its abundant solar energy resources. Several barriers have been identified for curtailing the development of solar energy systems in the island. One of the major difficulties is that Mauritius is not equipped with a high quality radiometric network that would allow an accurate mapping of its solar resources. Moreover, the presence of microclimates all over the island implies that {{it is essential for}} the assessment to be performed at a small spatial resolution. This problem has been addressed in many countries by using satellite-based datasets as a feasible alternative to acquire site-specific solar irradiation time-series records. In this work, the monthly and annual average global <b>solar</b> <b>irradiance</b> <b>maps</b> for Mauritius have been devised using mean monthly data obtained from the EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring.

40|$|As {{the most}} abundant, sustainable, and green energy source on the earth, solar energy has the {{potential}} to resolve environmental problems such as climate change and air pollution caused by fossil energy. Real-time <b>solar</b> <b>irradiance</b> <b>mapping,</b> which gives the real-time data on local solar energy distribution, would provide valuable information and lead to more efficient use of solar energy. State of California (CA) is abundant in solar energy. However, the data of real-time direct normal irradiance (DNI) in CA is still currently not available. This thesis focuses on developing-models that would use satellite data to <b>map</b> near real-time <b>solar</b> <b>irradiance</b> in CA and analyzing the potential economic and emission benefits of solar installation based on the modeled DNI data. The transmittance data was derived from GOES-WEST for the development of ON I model. The study showed that the major atmospheric factors influencing the <b>solar</b> <b>irradiance</b> are cloud coverage and aerosol concentration in non-clear and clear sky condition, respectively. This suggests that the transmittances of cloud and aerosol should be as accurate as possible when calculating DNI using satellite data. Next, the modeled DNI was compared with actual DNI data, and the results indicated a good agreement between them, implying that the modeled DNI data is a good estimate of the actual <b>solar</b> <b>irradiance.</b> Finally, the economic and emission benefits of solar use were analyzed based upon process-modeling and empirical regression approach. The results indicated that 0. 2 % coverage of solar PV in CA could reduce the C 02, NOx and S 02 emissions on average by 9. 08 %, 4. 51 % and 2. 73 % during 2007 summertime, respectively. The cost savings are amount to 48. 7 %, 32. 0 % and 16. 9 % in summer under three levels of PV installation rate.

40|$|Background: Considering the {{likelihood}} of global climatic weather pattern changes and the global competition for energy resources, there is an increasing need to provide improved and continuously updated global Earth surface solar resource information. Toward this end, a project was funded under the NASA Applied Science program involving the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Langley Research Center (LaRC), National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the State University of New York/Albany (SUNY) and the NOAA National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) to provide NREL with a global long-term advanced global solar mapping production system for improved depiction of historical solar resources and variability {{and to provide a}} mechanism for continual updates of solar resource information. This new production system is made possible by the efforts of NOAA and NASA to completely reprocess the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) data set that provides satellite visible and infrared radiances together with retrieved cloud and surface properties on a 3 -hourly basis beginning from July 1983. The old version of the ISCCP data provided this information for all the world TMs available geosynchronous satellite systems and NOAA TMs AVHRR data sets at a 30 km effective resolution. This new version aims to provide a new and improved satellite calibration at an effective 10 km resolution. Thus, working with SUNY, NASA will develop and test an improved production system that will enable NREL to continually update the Earth TM solar resource. Objective and Methods: In this presentation, we provide a general overview of this project together with samples of the new <b>solar</b> <b>irradiance</b> <b>mapped</b> data products and comparisons to surface measurements at various locations across the world. An assessment of the solar resource values relative to calibration uncertainty and assumptions are presented. Errors resulting assumptions in snow cover and background aerosol amount are described. These uncertainties and the statistics of the agreement between the measurements and new satellite estimates are also reviewed and compared to other solar data sets. Findings and Conclusions: Preliminary results show that insolation values show an overall small bias (less than 1 %) with a RMS of 25 % relative to surface measurements. Exceptions at certain locations were found and will be discussed relative to the uncertainties identified above. Lastly, we will identify the next steps in the development and improvement of this production system including some accuracy goals in preparation for ultimate delivery to NREL...|$|R
