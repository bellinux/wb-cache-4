5|$|The {{situation}} was so serious that Augustus himself {{appeared at the}} trial, {{even though he had}} not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order. Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to <b>subvert</b> <b>the</b> trial by using his auctoritas. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest. Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, the talkies were a global phenomenon. In the United States, they helped secure Hollywood's {{position}} {{as one of}} the world's most powerful cultural/commercial centers of influence (see Cinema of the United States). In Europe (and, to a lesser degree, elsewhere), the new development was treated with suspicion by many filmmakers and critics, who worried that a focus on dialogue would <b>subvert</b> <b>the</b> unique aesthetic virtues of soundless cinema. In Japan, where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance, talking pictures were slow to take root. In India, sound was the transformative element that led to the rapid expansion of the nation's film industry.|$|E
5|$|Diederichs {{requested}} reinforcements from Germany, and the Kaiser authorized {{a second}} Division to deploy to the East Asia station. The unit was therefore reorganized as the East Asia Squadron; Prinzess Wilhelm {{was assigned to}} the I Division of the Squadron. On 27 November, Diederichs was promoted to Vice Admiral for his success in seizing Kiaochou, and given command of the new Squadron. Chinese forces converged on the port {{by the end of the}} month. Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser moved into the harbor to provide artillery support. General Chang, who had been placed under house arrest, was discovered to have been attempting to <b>subvert</b> <b>the</b> German occupation; Dierderichs therefore placed him under arrest aboard Prinzess Wilhelm. A brief skirmish ensued, which quickly resulted in a Chinese rout. On 8 January, a force of 50 men from Prinzess Wilhelms crew was sent to Chi-mo to defend against Chinese raids in the area.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Bear's Carnival (2006) revisits the trope of the single-gender world, {{as a pair}} of {{gay male}} ambassador-spies attempt to {{infiltrate}} and <b>subvert</b> <b>the</b> predominately lesbian civilization of New Amazonia, whose matriarchal rulers have all but enslaved their men. In 2007, J.K. Rowling's statement that Albus Dumbledore, a character in her Harry Potter series, was gay caused some controversy. Sarah Hall's dystopian novel The Carhullan Army (2007), published in the US under the title Daughters of the North, matter of factly features lesbians as primary characters. The novel won the 2007 John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and James Tiptree, Jr. Award, and was shortlisted for the 2008 Arthur C. Clarke Award. It is perhaps telling of the evolution of public perception of same sex relationships that the relationships are unmentioned or only peripherally noted in reviews.|$|E

5|$|IGN {{wrote that}} the game's story and environments {{remained}} {{in the background and}} were ultimately forgettable, {{or in the case of}} the former, a hindrance, especially when the scenes could not be skipped on later replays. By the same token, predecessors such as Lara Croft Go hid treasures in its background such that players would revisit its levels, but Deus Ex Go had little to interest players besides its primary mission. The game's sole challenge of completing the puzzle in the fewest moves, GameSpot explained, quickly became uninteresting. Gamezebo reviewer instead faulted the series and wrote that after three games, its formula felt repetitive. TouchArcade concluded that, unlike the other Go games, Deus Ex Go was less creative overall and did not <b>subvert</b> <b>the</b> themes of its parent series quite like the others.|$|E
5|$|On Nimbus III, the Enterprise crew {{discovers that}} renegade Vulcan Sybok, Spock's half-brother, {{is behind the}} hostage crisis. Sybok reveals the hostage {{situation}} was a ruse to lure a starship to Nimbus III. Sybok wants to use a ship to reach the mythical planet Sha Ka Ree, the place where creation began; the planet lies behind a seemingly impenetrable barrier {{near the center of}} the galaxy. Sybok uses his unique ability to reveal and heal the innermost pain of a person through the mind meld to <b>subvert</b> <b>the</b> wills of the hostages and crew members. Only Spock and Kirk prove resistant to Sybok; Spock is unmoved by the experience and Kirk refuses the Vulcan's offer, telling him that his pain is what makes him human. Sybok reluctantly declares a truce with Kirk, realizing he needs his leadership experience to navigate the Enterprise to Sha Ka Ree.|$|E
5|$|Viewing elves {{as being}} more or less like people, and more or less outside Christian cosmology. The Icelanders who copied the Poetic Edda did not {{explicitly}} try to integrate elves into Christian thought. Likewise, the early modern Scottish people confessed to encountering elves seem not to have thought of themselves as having dealings with the Devil. Nineteenth-century Icelandic folklore about elves mostly presents them as a human agricultural community parallel to the visible human community, {{that may or may}} not be Christian. It is possible that stories were sometimes told from this perspective as a political act, to <b>subvert</b> <b>the</b> dominance of the Church.|$|E

5|$|Weber {{joined the}} worker and soldier council of Heidelberg in 1918. He then {{served in the}} German {{delegation}} to the Paris Peace Conference and as advisor to the Confidential Committee for Constitutional Reform, which drafted the Weimar Constitution. Motivated by {{his understanding of the}} American model, he advocated a strong, popularly elected presidency as a constitutional counterbalance {{to the power of the}} professional bureaucracy. More controversially, he also defended the provisions for emergency presidential powers that became Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution. These provisions were later used by Adolf Hitler to <b>subvert</b> <b>the</b> rest of the constitution and institute rule by decree, allowing his regime to suppress opposition and gain dictatorial powers.|$|E
5|$|Without the {{enactment}} of an appropriations bill, the state government would not have funds to operate, and the Democrats assumed that Morton {{would be forced to}} call a special session and recall the Republicans. The Democrats hoped to once again press their measures to weaken the governor, but Morton was aware of their plans. Going beyond his constitutional powers, Morton solicited millions of dollars in federal and private loans. Morton's move to <b>subvert</b> <b>the</b> state legislature was successful; he was able to privately fund the state government and the war effort in Indiana. Former Hoosier James Lanier of the New York banking firm of Winslow, Lanier and Company loaned Morton funds to pay interest on the state's debt until the state government could resume its revenue collecting efforts.|$|E
5|$|A man of {{progressive}} and relatively liberal ideas, Albert not only led reforms in university education, welfare, the royal finances and slavery, {{he had a}} special interest in applying science and art to the manufacturing industry. The Great Exhibition of 1851 arose from the annual exhibitions of the Society of Arts, of which Albert was President from 1843, and owed most of its success to his efforts to promote it. Albert {{served as president of the}} Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and had to fight for every stage of the project. In the House of Lords, Lord Brougham fulminated against the proposal to hold the exhibition in Hyde Park. Opponents of the exhibition prophesied that foreign rogues and revolutionists would overrun England, <b>subvert</b> <b>the</b> morals of the people, and destroy their faith. Albert thought such talk absurd and quietly persevered, trusting always that British manufacturing would benefit from exposure to the best products of foreign countries.|$|E

Meanwhile, Skinner tries to deal directly with The Smoking Man for Scully's life, who tells him he will get back to him. Inside the facility, Mulder discovers that Dr. Scanlon works alongside several clones of Kurt Crawford. The clones show him Scully's harvested ova and tell him they are trying to save the abducted women's lives, since they acted as their birth mothers. They also hope to <b>subvert</b> <b>the</b> colonization project as an inside job. Mulder takes Scully's ova and leaves, being pursued by the Gray-Haired Man as he escapes. He returns to the hospital to see Scully, who tells him that Penny has died but that she intends to fight the disease. Afterward, Mulder phones Skinner for letting him know Scully's doing ok and may return to work soon, as well as for thanking him for his advice about not negotiating with the Smoking Man, after which Skinner and the Smoking Man come to terms on their deal in seclusion.|$|E
5|$|Waters {{attempted}} to <b>subvert</b> <b>the</b> Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US {{and threatening to}} sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral. Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice. Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to assist them. As Pink Floyd toured throughout North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances. Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the flying pig. Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained {{the right to use}} the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall.|$|E
