50|$|Commissar {{features}} strong {{themes of}} feminism and motherhood in {{the backdrop of}} the Russian Civil War of 1918, and when completed was censored by the Soviet Union due to the <b>subject</b> <b>topic</b> being deemed: “a force that opposes the very essence of human existence, a phenomenon that destroys personal ties by causing alienation, despair, and uncertainty about the future.” In effect the censures saw the subject content and focus too negative for a state mandated heroic realism style, as in the opening scene a singing Madonna is passed by a marching regiment that eclipses the sound of her singing with their march. To the censures at the time, to portray the revolution as anything other than a positive change in society was a dangerous risk. Incidentally Commissar was the only film ever made by the director Aleksandr Askoldov, and it nearly had him arrested by the KGB.|$|E

Despite the change in the <b>subject</b> <b>topic</b> the book was just as successful as her previous novels being made an ALA Quick Pick, it also won the School Library Journal Best Book of the Year, and was selected by Voice of Youth Advocates for their [...] "Best Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror".

5000|$|Unlike {{the three}} earlier revisers, Rebecca Gowers {{generally}} avoids merging her own comments {{with the original}} text. Her practice is to retain Ernest Gowers's remarks and append updated observations in a separate note. An example is the entry {{on the use of}} the noun [...] "issue". The original words were: This word has a very wide range of proper meanings as a noun, and should not be made to do any more work - the work, for instance of <b>subject,</b> <b>topic,</b> consideration and dispute. To which the reviser has added: Note: The workload of issue has grown enormously since Gowers wrote this, not least because it now also doubles up on the job done by problem. Thus a government department these days might release a disastrous consultation paper in terms of issues to do with interoperability issues, even as a Minister has personal issues that threaten to become an issue in the press, causing the Prime Minister to have a major issue with the Minister. In short, Gowers's warning went unheeded, and issue is being made to labour harder than ever.|$|E

5000|$|The Quiet American is a 1955 {{novel by}} English author Graham Greene which depicts French and British {{colonialism}} in Vietnam being uprooted by the Americans during the 1950s. The novel implicitly questions {{the foundations of}} growing American involvement in Vietnam in the 1950s and is unique in its exploration of the <b>subject</b> <b>topic</b> through the links between its three main characters - Fowler, Pyle and Phuong. The novel has received much attention due to its prediction {{of the outcome of}} the Vietnam War and subsequent American foreign policy since the 1950s. Graham Greene portrays a U.S. official named Pyle as so blinded by American exceptionalism that he cannot see the calamities he brings upon the Vietnamese. It was adapted as two different movies during 1958 and 2002. The book uses Greene's experiences as a war correspondent for The Times and Le Figaro in French Indochina 1951-1954. He was apparently inspired to write The Quiet American during October 1951 while driving back to Saigon from Ben Tre province. He was accompanied by an American aid worker who lectured him about finding a [...] "third force in Vietnam”.|$|E

Fleming-May, the authors analyzed and criticized the undue-weight policy (relative importance of a given source), and concluded that Wikipedia is not about providing correct and definitive information about a subject, but instead presenting, as editorially dominant, the perspective taken by most authors of the sources for the article. This allegedly uneven application of the undue-weight policy creates omissions (of fact and of interpretation) that might give the reader false impressions about the subject matter, based upon the factually incomplete content of the Wikipedia article.|$|E
