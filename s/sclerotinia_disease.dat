40|$|Plant {{programmed}} {{cell death}} (PCD) is an essential process in plant-pathogen interactions. Importantly, PCD can have contrasting effects on the outcome depending on context. For example, plant PCD in plant-biotroph interactions is clearly beneficial to plants, whereas it could be detrimental to plants in plant-necrotroph interactions. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is an agriculturally and economically important necrotrophic pathogen. Previous {{studies have shown that}} S. sclerotiorum secretes oxalic acid (OA) to enhance Sclerotinia virulence by various mechanisms including induction of PCD in plants. A recent study has also shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation correlates with induction of PCD during disease development. These studies focus on links between ROS, oxalate, and PCD, and how they impact S. sclerotiorum disease development. I examined the involvement of ROS in pathogenic development of S. sclerotiorum. I identified and functionally characterized two predicted S. sclerotiorum NADPH oxidases (Nox 1 and Nox 2) by RNAi. Both nox genes appear to have roles in sclerotial development, while only Nox 1 -silenced mutants showed reduced virulence. Interestingly, the reduced virulence of the Nox 1 -silenced mutant correlated with decreased production of OA in the mutant. This observation suggests that regulation of ROS by S. sclerotiorum Nox 1 may be linked to OA. The next study details the phenotype of plants inoculated with an S. sclerotiorum oxalate deficient mutant (A 2), which showed restricted growth at the infected site. This response resembles the hypersensitive response (HR), and is associated with plant resistance responses including cell wall strengthening, plant oxidative burst, and induction of defensin genes. Conversely, leaves infected with wild type showed unrestricted spreading of cell death and were not associated with these resistant responses. Furthermore, previous work had shown that a Caenorhabditis elegans anti-apoptotic gene (ced- 9) conferred resistance to wild type S. sclerotiorum, while this gene had negligible effects on the phenotype of plant leaves inoculated with A 2 mutants. These findings suggest that HR-like cell death by A 2 and PCD by wild type S. sclerotiorum may be regulated by different pathways. As a whole, these results reveal the importance of ROS, oxalate, and PCD in <b>Sclerotinia</b> <b>disease</b> development as well as the significance of interplay between them. These studies contribute {{to the understanding of the}} underlying mechanisms of <b>Sclerotinia</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{predictive}} model for production of apothecia by carpogenic germination of sclerotia is presented for Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. The model {{is based on}} the assumption that a conditioning phase must be completed before a subsequent germination phase can occur. Experiments involving transfer of sclerotia from one temperature regime to another allowed temperature-dependent rates to be derived for conditioning and germination for two S. sclerotiorum isolates. Although the response of each isolate to temperature was slightly different, sclerotia were fully conditioned after 2 to 6 days at 5 degrees C in soil but took up to 80 days at 15 degrees C. Subsequent germination took more than 200 days at 5 degrees C and 33 to 52 days at 20 degrees C. Upper temperature thresholds for conditioning and germination were 20 and 25 degrees C, respectively. A {{predictive model}} for production of apothecia derived from these data was successful in simulating the germination of multiple burials of sclerotia in the field when a soil water potential threshold of between - 4. 0 and - 12. 25 kilopascals (kPa) was imposed.

Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) implicated in partial resistance to basal stem rot disease was identified using the 116 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the cross between the sunflower parental lines PAC 2 and RHA 266. RILs and their parents were arranged in a completely randomized design with six replications and inoculated with a moderately aggressive isolate (SSU 107) of S. sclerotiorum under controlled conditions. QTLs were mapped using a recently developed high-density single sequence repeat/ amplified fragment length polymorphism (SSR/AFLP) sunflower linkage map. Analysis of variance showed highly significant differences among the sunflower genotypes for susceptibility to basal stem rot. The frequency distribution of genotypes for susceptibility to disease showed continuous patterns, suggesting that resistance is controlled by a polygenic system. Transgressive segregation for resistance occurred in this cross. Composite interval mapping analysis revealed 7 QTLs for percentage necrotic area, localized on 7 linkage groups. The effects of QTLs were small to moderate indicating a polygenic control of the studied character. However, like any other quantitative trait, {{it is necessary to}} confirm the position of the QTLs and carry out fine-scale mapping before marker assisted selection (MAS).

After RNA sequences were subjected to BLASTp analysis using NCBI database, 285 contigs representing partial or complete genomes of 57 mycoviruses were obtained, and 34 of these (59. 6 %) were novel viruses. These 57 viruses were grouped into 10 distinct lineages, namely Endornaviridae (four novel mycoviruses), Genomoviridae (isolate of SsHADV- 1), Hypoviridae (two novel mycoviruses), Mononegavirales (four novel mycovirusess), Narnaviridae (10 novel mycoviruses), Partitiviridae (two novel mycoviruses), Ourmiavirus (two novel mycovirus), Tombusviridae (two novel mycoviruses), Totiviridae (one novel mycovirus), Tymovirales (five novel mycoviruses), and two non-classified mycoviruses lineages (one Botrytis porri RNA virus 1, one distantly related to Aspergillus fumigatus tetramycovirus- 1).

It can be found at: [URL] germination of sclerotia and infection of flowers by ascospores of Sclerotinia minor is rare and seldom documented in most hosts. During 2007 – 2009, S. minor isolates were obtained from surface-sterilized pyrethrum flowers collected from fields in Australia. The isolation frequency of S. minor from flowers in 2007, 2008 and 2009 was 15. 8 %, 5 % and 1. 4 %, respectively. During these years, the prevalence of S. minor in flowers amongst pyrethrum fields varied between 10. 3 % and 60 %. Sclerotia with apothecia, consistent in size with S. minor, were collected in one field. Colonies from individual ascospores from this isolate were identified as S. minor. A subsample of 10 S. minor isolates was selected for further studies. Phylogenetic analysis based on the internal transcribed spacer region grouped these isolates with S. minor, and distinct from published sequences of other Sclerotinia spp. Species-specific primers developed previously to differentiate the four major Sclerotinia spp. (S. sclerotiorum, S. minor, S. homoeocarpa and S. trifoliorum) were used to confirm identity.

40|$|Ascospores of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum {{produced}} from apothecia {{are the primary}} source of inoculum for causing diseases such as white mold of common bean, pod rot of pea, stem blight of canola and head rot of sunflower and safflower in the Canadian prairies. A field study was conducted for 4 years to determine efficacy of control of production of apothecia from carpogenically germinated sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum by soil amendment with Pertka((R)) (calcium cyanamide) and S-H mixture (a formulated compound). Results of the 4 -year experiments showed that amendment of soil with Perlka((R)) at low (30 g/m(2)) or high (60 g/m(2)) rate was effective in reducing carpogenic germination of sclerotia and production of apothecia under the canopy of host crops (common bean and canola) and a non-host crop (wheat). In the experiments of 1988, for example, the numbers of apothecia produced in the treatments of Perlka((R)) -low rate (30 g/m(2)), Perlka((R)) -high rate (60 g/m(2)) and untreated control were 42, 46, and 182 apothecia/plot (m(2)), respectively, for bean; 89, 42, and 318 apothecia/plot (m(2)), respectively, for canola; and 146, 143, and 412 apothecia/plot (m(2)), respectively, for wheat.

Stem rot of tomato, also caused by S. sclerotiorum, was also studied under field conditions. Lucerne hay, stable manure and fowl manure greatly suppressed disease incidence caused by S. sclerotiorum in lettuce and tomato crops. These amendments significantly reduced sclerotium numbers remaining in the soil after crop harvest. This was observed in the field and in glasshouse experiments. Incorporation of organic amendments, in particular lucerne hay, stable manure and fowl manure, significantly increased the number and fresh weight of marketable lettuce heads and the number and fresh weight of marketable tomato fruit. There was 100 % germination when sclerotia were added to soil extract and distilled water. Aqueous leachates from lucerne hay, stable manure and cow manure, however, substantially reduced the viability of sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum. Sclerotium viability was reduced when tomato stems infested with S. sclerotiorum were buried in a compost heap (internal temperature 50 - 600 C) and composted for seven weeks. There was a 100 % kill of sclerotia isolated from infested material and buried in the compost heap, 98 % kill of sclerotia incubated in an oven at 40 C compared to 10 % reduction in viability of those isolated from non-composted infected tomato stems.

40|$|The plant {{pathogen}} Sclerotinia sclerotiorum can cause serious losses on lettuce crops worldwide {{and as for}} most other susceptible crops, control relies on the application of fungicides, which target airborne ascospores. However, the efficacy of this approach depends on accurate timing of these sprays, which could be improved by {{an understanding of the}} environmental conditions that are conducive to infection. A mathematical model for S. sclerotiorum infection and disease development on lettuce is presented here for the first time, based on quantifying the effects of temperature, relative humidity (RH) and ascospore density in multiple controlled environment experiments. It was observed that disease can develop on lettuce plants inoculated with dry ascospores in the absence of apparent leaf wetness (required for spore germination). To explain this, the model conceptualises an infection court area containing microsites (in leaf axils and close to the stem base) where conditions are conducive to infection, the size of which is modified by ambient RH. The model indicated that minimum, maximum and optimum temperatures for ascospore germination were 0. 0, 29. 9 and 21. 7 °C respectively and that maximum rates of disease development occurred at spore densities > 87 spores cm- 2. Disease development was much more rapid at 80 - 100 % RH at 20 °C, compared to 50 - 70 % RH and resulted in a greater proportion of lettuce plants infected. Disease development was also more rapid at 15 - 27 °C compared to 5 - 10 °C (85 % RH). The model was validated by a further series of independent controlled environment experiments where both RH and temperature were varied and generally simulated the pattern of disease development well.

40|$|Kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa (A. Chev.) C. F. Liang et A. R. Ferguson, var. deliciosa cv. „Hayward?), a {{valuable}} fruit grown in New Zealand orchards for export, {{is susceptible to}} the necrotrophic and cosmopolitan fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary. <b>Sclerotinia</b> <b>disease</b> causes direct crop loss {{in the form of}} diseased fruitlets, scarring of fruit and field rot of fruit. Costs to the industry amounting to an estimated $ 5 million pa. are incurred through crop loss on vines or during grading and through the purchase and application of fungicide. This study showed that 19 % (range 0 – 53 %) of 3 – 4 day-old kiwifruit petals were colonised by S. sclerotiorum ascospores arising from apothecia that were present within most orchards. Adhering floral tissues (AFT) were present on 38 % of fruit 7 – 8 weeks after anthesis and 11 % (range 0 – 43 %) of these were colonised by S. sclerotiorum. The incidence of fruit with scarring was significantly higher on fruit with AFT than fruit without AFT. Removal of AFT 10 – 14 days after anthesis resulted in a 66 % reduction in diseased fruitlets and a 85 % reduction in fruit with scarring. Adhering floral tissues on fruit were therefore determined to be a major source of secondary spread. An in vitro assay was developed in which freshly detached kiwifruit petals were inoculated with dry S. sclerotiorum ascospores in a settling chamber and incubated for 72 h. The number of discrete colonies which formed on selective agar medium, when macerated petal tissue was spread on the agar, effectively quantified petal colonisation. Colonisation of petals significantly increased with increasing flower age. Colonisation of petals incubated under static conditions within saturated salt chambers was highest between 18 – 27 oC and 90 – 100 % relative humidity. Colonisation of petals in dynamically controlled environment chambers was inhibited by incubation in diurnally fluctuating temperature and relative humidity conditions typical of days with < 5 mm rainfall during flowering. The minimum, maximum and optimum temperatures for mycelial growth on PDA and percentage germination of ascospores on water agar (5 oC, 34 oC and 23 oC respectively) were similar to those for the rate of colonisation of petals by ascospores at 100 % RH. Symptoms of diseased fruitlets, fruit scarring and field rot were reproduced in field inoculation experiments, provided free moisture was present for at least 9 h. Sclerotia iii were extracted from diseased fruitlets and fruit with field rot from three vines, yielding 2. 7 and 18. 6 sclerotia per unit respectively. Diseased fruitlets produced significantly smaller sclerotia, which had a higher germination rate and produced smaller apothecia, compared with sclerotia from fruit with field rot. External damage on 39 % of sclerotia from fruit with field rot and their closer contact with soil micro-organisms during formation and maturation are likely causes for these observed differences in germination rate. Thus, the type of symptom which develops on pistillate vines can affect the potential for ascospore production during subsequent seasons through the production of ecologically distinct populations of sclerotia. During field studies in 18 orchards, positive relationships were shown between primary inoculum source (apothecial density) and primary infection (incidence of petal colonisation) and between both these factors and the incidence of diseased fruitlets and fruit with scarring. A conceptual model of inoculum production and disease development was constructed. This model highlights the importance of primary colonisation of floral tissues and showed that disease risk can be estimated from the apothecial density or the colonisation of petals by S. sclerotiorum. Model structures have also been developed for predicting disease risk and disease incidence. Disease management strategies are discussed, and if implemented, would rationalise decision processes and potentially reduce the costs of controlling sclerotinia. Decision support software could be developed to incorporate such models once they are validated and combined with further research to determine effective control measures. This software could then be integrated into a sclerotinia management system for kiwifruit in New Zealand...|$|E

Usage recommendations based on field studies have provided a more consistent product, by optimising conditions for biocontrol. Genetic studies on genes implicated in mycoparasitism have revealed molecular targets for optimising biocontrol response, however much is unknown about the genetic regulation of mycoparasitism. The majority of reported Trichoderma biocontrol agents are T. harzianum or T. atroviride, however a T. hamatum isolate (6 Sr 4) with significant activity against <b>Sclerotinia</b> <b>diseases</b> of vegetable crops, has recently been developed for use as a commercial biocontrol agent of soilborne fungal diseases. In this study, three genes previously implicated in the mycoparasitic ability of T. atroviride were characterised from 6 Sr 4, and from two other T. Hamatum isolates of variable biocontrol potential to further current knowledge on the regulation of mycoparasitism, and identify molecular targets for research on optimisation of Trichoderma biocontrol activity in the field. Using a combination of targeted, degenerate and inverse PCR, gene orthologues of chit 42, prb 1 and xbg 1. 3 - 110 were isolated, cloned and sequenced from all three T. Hamatum isolates and sequence analysis performed on the regulatory regions. Comparison between the different genes revealed regions of identity between chit 42 and prb 1, which supported the existence of a global inducer of mycoparasitism, suggested for T. atroviride. Identification of putative regulatory motifs in prb 1 supported mutational work in T. atroviride prb 1, which suggested an actively bound GATA site involved in nitrogen repression. Northern blotting was performed to examine gene expression under alternate carbon sources and during mycoparasitism. In 6 Sr 4, chit 42 and prb 1 were strongly induced under high glycerol, whereas no induction was detected from xbg 1. 3 - 110. Conversely, no chit 42 or prb 1 induction was detected from a T. harzianum isolate (JD 2) grown in the same study and only low induction of prb 1 from T. atroviride has been reported. This suggested T. hamatum chit 42 and prb 1 to be under control of an additional pathway not active in T. harzianum and T. atroviride. Both chit 42 and prb 1 were moderately induced during confrontation against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, which supported a role in mycoparasitism. Xbg 1. 3 - 110 had been previously implicated in mycoparasitism by T. harzianum, however no northern analysis during mycoparasitism has not been reported. This study detected no xbg 1. 3 - 110 expression during confrontation and therefore questions its importance in mycoparasitism. Genetic variation between the three isolates was assessed using UP-PCR, sequence alignments of chit 42, prb 1 and xbg 1. 3 - 110, and comparison of chit 42 expression in response to elevated glycerol and during confrontation with S. sclerotiorum. 6 Sr 4 and 3 Sr 4 - 2 were more similar than either isolate with S 1 BYG, which did not correlate with observed biocontrol potential or colony morphology. Sequence analysis revealed multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the regulatory regions of chit 42, prb 1 and xbg 1. 3 - 110, some associated with putative regulatory sites. In S 1 BYG, chit 42 expression was delayed relative to 6 Sr 4 and 3 Sr 4 - 2. These studies identified multiple targets for future research. Most notable is the potential to incorporate glycerol into inoculant amendments to optimise chit 42 and prb 1 expression.

Two genotypes had high partial resistance to all S. sclerotiorum isolates, whereas others were susceptible to all isolates. Isolates of S. sclerotiorum differed in virulence to host genotypes. Some genotypes showed specific interactions with S. sclerotiorum isolates, being resistant to some isolates but susceptible to others. Recom­binant inbred lines used in this study showed different reactions to eight isolates of S. sclerotiorum when compared with their parental lines. The isolate-specific and isolate-nonspecific partial resistant genotypes identified in present experiments should be used in crossing programmes for breeding of durable resistance to <b>Sclerotinia</b> basal stem <b>disease.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is one {{the major}} crops {{produced}} worldwide. However, soybean {{is susceptible to}} many <b>diseases.</b> <b>Sclerotinia</b> stem rot (SSR) <b>disease</b> caused by <b>Sclerotinia</b> sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary {{is considered one of}} the most important fungal diseases of soybean. It can be controlled by chemicals (e. g. fungicides), by breeding cultivars with disease resistance and by cultural control (e. g. increasing the width between rows, reducing plant populations). A promising and complementary method of controlling SSR disease in the field is the application of biological control agents. Biological control agents introduced in a soil environment will interact with other soil food web organisms, as do the pathogenic organism and infected plants, which may change the genetic and functional diversity in soil microbial communities. Profiling these changes may lead to an improved understanding of the interactions between these players (biological control agents, pathogens, soil biota and plants) in the biological control phenomenom, permiting us to exploit naturally-occurring ecological relationships and develop more sustainable approaches to control soybean diseases. Fatty acid biomarkers analysis was used to profile microbial communities in soils. Two laboratory studies were conducted to evaluate the methods used for extraction and profiling the fatty acid biomarkers from soil samples with a range of soil properties (clay content, organic matter content), The first study investigated the best solvent mixture for recovering fatty acid biomarkers from soil using an automated pressurized solvent extraction (PSE) system. Solvent mixtures containing chloroform and methanol were more efficient at extracting fatty acids from agricultural soils than hexane: 2 -propanol and acetone. The second study presented an exploratory pyrolysis-mass spectrometry technique to rapidly fingerprint soil lipids extracted from different agroecosystems. Pyrolysis-mass spectrometry discriminated among soils and crop production systems in the same way as the fatty acid profiling. I also report on the efficicacy of biological control agents to control <b>Sclerotinia</b> stem rot <b>disease</b> in soybean. A two-year study was conducted in soybean fields under conventional or no tillage to determine whether Trichoderma virens (SoilGard(TM)) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (a mixture of Glomus intraradices and G. mosseae), used alone or in combination, could reduce sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) disease incidence. Generally, SSR disease indicators, as well as the soybean yield, were not affected significantly by the biological control treatments. I then studied whether changes in microbial community composition were related to the inoculation of the biological control agents and the disease incidence in soybean fields. Inoculation of biological control agents changes the expression of many soil fatty acids during both years of the trial. Also, in the plots with severely diseased plants, fatty acids biomarkers of gram positive and actinomycetes bacteria were significantly greater than in plots with healthy plants. I conclude that further improvement in laboratory techniques and procedures will permit researchers to efficiently extract and characterize soil lipids, providing new insight into soil organic matter dynamics and soil microbial ecology. Further study will be needed to verify the efficacy and optimize the application method, dose and timing of biocontrol agents to provide protection against SSR disease in soybean fields...|$|R
40|$|Blossom blight of alfalfa {{was first}} {{identified}} on the Canadian prairies in 1993. It Is caused by two common fungal pathogens, Botrytis cinerea and <b>Sclerotinia</b> sclerotiorum. This <b>disease</b> develops rapidly under wet and cool weather conditions, and {{can result in}} serious losses in alfalfa seed yield. Strategies {{for the management of}} the disease are needed. This study was conducted to develop a quick method to assess the incidence of the two pathogens in alfalfa flowers in the field, to screen cultivars for resistance to infection by B. cinerea and to quantify the relationship between environmental conditions and infection incidence. Various amendments to potato dextrose agar (PDA) and pretreatments in the dark vs. a 14 -h photoperiod were explored to develop a semi-selective medium for rapid identification of the causal agents. Amendment with alfalfa leaves in PDA and pretreatment in the dark promoted sporulation of B. cinerea and sclerotial formation of S. sclerotiorum. A combination of alfalfa leaves and lactic acid in PDA (AL-PDA) or pimaricin, chloramphenicol and alfalfa leaves in PDA (PCL-PDA) resulted in the best suppression of contamination in field samples. AL-PDA also promoted sporulation of B. cinerea and sclerotial formation of S. sclerotiorum. The reaction of 12 alfalfa cultivars to infection by B. cinerea was evaluated in several tests, including detached flower and whole plant tests in growth cabinets and field tests. There were consistent differences among cultivars in their susceptibility to infection by B. cinerea. Cvs. DK 135, OAC Minto and Iroquois were generally less susceptible than cvs. Apollo II, Algonquin and Heinrichs. Upward-facing flowers in cv. Vernal were less susceptible (16 %) than downward-facing flowers (86 %). Purple flowers were less susceptible than white flowers in cv. Iroquois, but not in cvs. Apollo II and AC Nordica. The impact of wetness duration and temperature on infection of alfalfa flowers by B. cinerea was examined under controlled conditions in a split-plot design. The main-plot treatments were different temperatures (10 °, 15 °, 20 °, 25 °, 30 °C) and the subplot treatments were surface wetness duration (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 48 h). The incidence of infection of alfalfa flowers was very low at 0, 4 and 8 h of wetness for all temperatures. Incidence increased sharply after 12 h at 20 °C, 16 h at 15 °C and 20 h at 10 ° and 25 °C. Infection at 30 °C was very low. The optimum conditions for infection were between 15 ° and 20 °C, with a minimum of 12 to 16 h of surface wetness...|$|R
