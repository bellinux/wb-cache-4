40|$|Sport {{performance}} in dressage and show jumping are two important traits in the breeding goals of many studbooks. To determine the optimum selection scheme for jumping and dressage, knowledge is {{needed on the}} genetic correlation between both disciplines and between traits measured early in life and {{performance in}} competition in each discipline. This study aimed to estimate genetic parameters to support decision-making on <b>specialization</b> <b>of</b> <b>breeding</b> horses for dressage and show jumping in Dutch warmblood horses. Genetic correlations between performance of horses in dressage and show jumping were estimated {{as well as the}} genetic correlation between traits recorded during studbook-entry inspections and performance in dressage and show jumping competitions. The information on competition comprised the performance of 82 694 horses in dressage and 62 072 horses in show jumping, recorded in the period 1993 - 2012. For 26 056 horses, information was available for both disciplines. The information on traits recorded at studbook-entry inspections comprised 62 628 horses, recorded in the period 1992 - 2013. Genetic parameters were estimated from the whole dataset and from a subset without horses recorded in both disciplines. Additionally, the genetic parameters were estimated in three different time periods defined by horses' birth year. The genetic correlation between dressage and show jumping in the whole dataset was - 0. 23, and it was - 0. 03 when it was estimated from horses recorded in only one discipline. The genetic correlation between dressage and show jumping was more negative in the most recent time period in all the cases. The more negative correlation between disciplines in more recent time periods was not reflected in changes in the correlations between competitions traits and the traits recorded in the studbook-first inspection. These results suggest that a breeding programme under specialization might be most effective defining two separate aggregate breeding goals for each of the disciplines...|$|E

40|$|In the 1970 s and 1980 s Dutch farmers {{replaced}} their dual-purpose Friesian cows with Holsteins, {{a highly}} specialized American dairy breed. The changeover {{was related to}} a major turnabout in breeding practices that involved the adoption of quantitative genetics. Dutch commercial breeders had long resisted the quantitative approach to breeding that scientists had been recommending since World War II. After about 1970, however, they gave up their resistance: the art <b>of</b> <b>breeding,</b> it was said, finally became a science. In historical overviews this turnabout is {{seen as part of}} what is called the “modernization project” in Dutch agriculture that the government instigated after the war. Economic developments are assumed to have necessitated this project, and <b>specialization</b> <b>of</b> production is seen as a natural consequence. This essay argues that the idea that the art <b>of</b> <b>breeding</b> was turned into a science is to a certain extent misleading. Furthermore, it aims to show that economic pressures and government policies cannot adequately explain the turn toward Holsteins. A better understanding can be obtained by framing the Holsteinization process {{as the result of a}} changeover in breeding culture—that is, in the ensemble of shared convictions, beliefs, conventions, methods, practices, and the like that characterized practical cattle breeding and that involved scientific, technical, economic, aesthetic, normative, and commercial considerations...|$|R

The proposed approach aims to summarize the divergent expression of comparative advantages by commodity groups and countries and to arrive at the general pattern <b>of</b> export <b>specialization.</b> The conclusion is drawn that the contemporary international trade is characterized by asymmetric <b>specialization</b> <b>of</b> exports. This is reflected in the <b>specialization</b> <b>of</b> a large group of countries in the export of lower-processed products and vice versa, a small group of countries specialized in the export of highly-processed products. ...|$|R
