50|$|Ilex williamsii is {{a species}} of plant in the Aquifoliaceae family. It is endemic to Honduras. It is a seldom {{collected}} <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> forest and is of a terrestrial ecozone. The plant is critically endangered as of 1998.|$|E
50|$|Cumulus {{congestus}} {{clouds are}} characteristic of unstable areas of the atmosphere which are undergoing convection. They are often characterized by sharp outlines and great vertical development. Because they are produced by strong updrafts, they are typically taller than they are wide, and cloud tops can reach 6 km, or higher in the tropics. Cumulus congestus clouds are formed {{by the development of}} cumulus mediocris generally, though they can also be formed from altocumulus castellanus or stratocumulus castellanus as well. The congestus <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> can only be found in the genus cumulus and is designated as towering cumulus (Tcu) by the International Civil Aviation Organization. Congestus clouds are capable of producing severe turbulence and showers of moderate to heavy intensity. This species is classified as vertical or multi-étage and is coded CL2 in the synop report. These clouds are usually too large and opaque to have any opacity or pattern-based varieties.|$|E
50|$|However, it {{has been}} found that the two <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> tend to {{separate}} due to windshear. Additionally, the detection methods have limitations, as both species have the potential to be masked by other types of aerosol, such as water or ice; this contributes to great variability in the data.|$|R

50|$|These are {{essentially}} nocturnal woodland owls of temperate or colder climates; the two northern species breed in North America’s coniferous forests, and the unspotted saw-whet owl and buff-fronted owl (Central and South America respectively) are <b>species</b> <b>of</b> mountain, <b>cloud</b> or oak forests.|$|R
50|$|Batomys uragon (proposed {{common name}} Mt. Isarog hairy-tailed rat) is a <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> rat endemic to the Philippines. It was first {{discovered}} in 1988, {{and the full}} description was published in 2015, in the Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington. It is so far found only on Luzon, the largest island in the Philippines. The first specimen was collected from Mount Isarog at the southern side of the island. Other 14 specimens were later collected. It is the fourth species of mammal (so far known) living only on that mountain. The new species was described by Danilo S. Balete, Eric A. Rickart, Lawrence R. Heaney, and Sharon A. Jansa. It was classified as new species based on DNA analyses and structural descriptions (morphometrc analyses). It is different from its closest relative, the Luzon hairy-tailed rat (Batomys granti), in its cytochrome b sequence, moderate body size, colour patterns, and skull structure.|$|E
50|$|The Dinagat bushy-tailed cloud rat, Dinagat crateromys or Dinagat cloud rat (Crateromys australis) is a <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> rat in {{the family}} Muridae. It {{is one of the}} eight cloud rats found only in the Philippines, and is {{specifically}} endemic to Dinagat Island. It is known locally as hawili. A single specimen was discovered in 1975 by Dioscoro S. Rabor and his team during a scientific survey in Dinagat. The natural habitat is tropical lowland forests, which is facing environmental threats. Habitat loss is caused by progressive deforestation from heavy logging and chromite mining in the area. Due to its rare occurrence and habitat destruction, the species is classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List in 2008. The assessment noted that the species could have been already extinct. Almost 40 years after the original discovery, five live specimens were discovered by Milada Řeháková, Václav Řehák and William L.R. Oliver, in 2012.|$|E
5000|$|The cloud rats are a {{group of}} {{arboreal}} and folivorous [...] nocturnal rodents native to the forests of the Philippines. There are six known species of true cloud rat, and two dwarf cloud rat species. These animals have not been studied extensively. The Filipino Ecosystems Research and Development Bureau has begun breeding Northern Luzon slender-tailed cloud rats in captivity. Several European and North American zoos keep a breed cloud rats in captivity, such as London Zoo, Prague Zoo, Central Park Zoo and the Bronx Zoo. Some <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> rats are kept in the mini-zoo of the College of Agriculture and Forestry of the West Visayas State University in their Lambunao campus {{in the province of}} Iloilo. Cloud rats are slow-moving herbivores and are thought to be preyed upon by large birds such as the Philippine eagle. The rats are quite large, and they have been hunted by people in the Philippines for their meat, driving the rodents to near extinction.|$|E
50|$|Cirrus {{castellanus}} is a <b>species</b> <b>of</b> cirrus <b>cloud.</b> Its {{name comes}} from the word castellanus, which means of a fort, of a castle in Latin. Like all cirrus, this species occurs at high altitudes. It appears as separate turrets rising from a lower-level cloud base. Often these cloud turrets form in lines, {{and they can be}} taller than they are wide. This cloud species is usually dense in formation.|$|R
5000|$|Mammatus (mamma or mammatocumulus), meaning [...] "mammary cloud", is a {{cellular}} pattern of pouches hanging underneath the base <b>of</b> a <b>cloud,</b> typically cumulonimbus rainclouds, {{although they may}} be attached to other classes <b>of</b> parent <b>clouds.</b> The name mammatus {{is derived from the}} Latin [...] (meaning [...] "udder" [...] or [...] "breast"). According to the WMO International Cloud Atlas, mamma is a cloud supplementary feature rather than a genus, <b>species</b> or variety <b>of</b> <b>cloud.</b> They are formed by cold air sinking down to form the pockets contrary to the puffs <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> rising through the convection of warm air. These formations were first described in 1894 by William Clement Ley.|$|R
40|$|On flights {{with the}} DLR icing {{research}} aircraft {{the dependence of}} aircraft icing on cloudphysical parameters was determined; both for aircraft-referred icing and for normalized icing, {{as well as for}} various clouds and locations in clouds. This is done with an improvement of icing predicitons in mind. The <b>species</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cloud</b> and the distance from cloud base are called here cloud parameters; while under cloudphysical parameters are understood liquid water content, temperature, particle size distribution and particle phase. Results from four icing flights are discussed, selected from a total of forty vertical soundings. —The results are arranged in four classes: Stratus/cumulus mixed, stratus; with and without precipitation at the ground...|$|R
30|$|The Mantiqueira Mountains {{are a part}} of the Atlantic Forest domain in Brazil, {{in which}} altitudinal forests are located, and can be {{classified}} as Cloud Forests, since they are practically covered by fog during most of the year. These forests represent biodiverse and endemic unique ecosystems, which are generally fragmented and threatened, and present a vegetation which is not well studied yet (Aldrich et al. [1997]; Bertoncello et al. [2011]). Studies conducted by Bertoncello et al. ([2011]) showed that Drimys brasiliensis Miers is considered one of the indicator <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> forests in the South and Southeast regions of Brazil. In addition, studies by Meireles et al. ([2008]) suggested that the species presents its best development in montane environments.|$|E

He contributed over 34000 specimens to herbaria around the world. He led an expedition to study the flora of a region known as the Maquipucuna Reserve in the Andes, publishing surveys and {{a book on the}} remarkable <b>species</b> diversity <b>of</b> its <b>cloud</b> forests.|$|R
50|$|It is a cloud species {{attached}} to the cloud genera cirrus, cirrocumulus, altocumulus and stratocumulus. <b>Species</b> <b>of</b> the <b>clouds</b> include cirrus castellanus, cirrocumulus castellanus, altocumulus castellanus and stratocumulus castellanus. Sometimes cumulus castellanus are referred to, but the type is not recognised by the France's national meteorological service Météo-France, or by the American Meteorological Society and World Meteorological Organisation. Those clouds some would classify as cumulus castellanus typically {{do not have a}} common base and are not arranged in a line, thus differing to some extent from the more universally-recognised castellanus types. Some scientists also think that the castellanus should be a full cloud genus, and not just a cloud species. The Federal Aviation Administration implicitly considers a castellanus as a full cloud genus.|$|R
5000|$|Cirrostratus {{nebulosus}} is a <b>species</b> <b>of</b> high-level cirrostratus <b>cloud.</b> The name cirrostratus nebulosus {{is derived}} from Latin, meaning [...] "full of vapor, foggy, cloudy, dark". Cirrostratus nebulosus {{is one of the}} two most common forms that cirrostratus often takes, with the other being cirrostratus fibratus. The nebulosus species is featureless and uniform, while the fibratus species has a fibrous appearance. Cirrostratus nebulosus are formed by gently rising air. The cloud is often hard to see unless the sun shines through it at the correct angle, forming a halo. While usually very light, the cloud may also be very dense, and the exact appearance <b>of</b> the <b>cloud</b> can vary from one formation to another. In the winter, precipitation often follows behind these clouds; however, they are not a precipitation-producing cloud.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the advertisement and combat calls, combat behavior, and reproductive {{behavior of the}} glass frog Centrolene lynchi, an endemic <b>species</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cloud</b> forests <b>of</b> Ecuador. The typical advertisement call consists of a tonal note and 1 – 3 peaked notes, each with 1 – 3 pulses. Variations on this advertisement call include {{the addition of a}} short note before the tonal note, as well as the absence of the tonal note. These modifications may be similar to thedescribed call modifications of other anurans in response to the presence of conspecific females and males, potential predators and/or changes in the sound environment. Additionally, we {{describe the}} combat call emitted during previously undescribed venter-toventercombat between males. The discovery of this combat behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that venter-to-venter combat behavior is a shared derived trait of the subfamily Centroleninae. Finally, we describe male reproductive habits and development <b>of</b> the <b>species,</b> including egg attendance by males and implied male parental care...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} two new <b>species</b> <b>of</b> Phrynopus from <b>cloud</b> {{forests in}} Cochabamba, Bolivia. The new species {{are assigned to}} the P. peruanus group and are characterized {{by the presence of}} basal webbing, distinctive coloration, and by having the first finger shorter than the second. The first <b>of</b> these new <b>species</b> was collected near Montepunko in Parque Nacional Carrasco and is known from eight males and six females. Among its distinctive characteristics are round cream-colored glands on its flanks. A second species is known from one male and one female collected near “Zona de Aguirre” near the northwest border of the park. V and X-shaped blotches and a dorsum that is smooth except for dorsolateral and scapular folds characterize this species. Musculature has rarely been described for <b>species</b> <b>of</b> Phrynopus.

40|$|Quantized vortex core {{structure}} is theoretically investigated in Fermion superfluids with population imbalance for two atom <b>species</b> <b>of</b> neutral atom <b>clouds</b> near a Feshbach resonance. In contrast with vortex core in balance {{case where the}} quantum depletion makes a vortex visible through the density profile measurement, the vortex core is filled in and becomes less visible because the quantized discrete bound states are occupied exclusively by the majority species. Yet it is shown that the core can be visible through the minority density profile experiment using phase contrast imaging, revealing an interesting opportunity to examine low-lying Fermionic core bound states unexplored so far.

40|$|Sites {{described}} as tropical montane cloud forests differ greatly, {{in part because}} observers tend to differ in their opinion as to what constitutes frequent and prolonged immersion in cloud. This definitional difficulty interferes with hydrologic analyses, assessments of environmental impacts on ecosystems, and biogeographical analyses <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> forest communities and <b>species.</b> Quantitative measurements <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> immersion can be obtained on site, but the observations are necessarily spatially limited, although well-placed observers can examine 10 50 km of a mountain range under rainless conditions. Regional analyses, however, require observations at a broader scale. This chapter discusses remote sensing and modeling approaches that can provide quantitative measures of the spatiotemporal patterns <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> cover and cloud immersion in tropical mountain ranges. These approaches integrate remote sensing tools of various spatial resolutions and frequencies of observation, digital elevation models, regional atmospheric models, and ground-based observations to provide measures <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> cover, cloud base height, and the intersection <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> and terrain. This combined approach {{was applied to the}} Monteverde region of northern Costa Rica to illustrate how the proportion of time the forest is immersed in cloud may vary spatially and temporally. The observed spatial variation was largely due to patterns of airflow over the mountains. The temporal variation reflected the diurnal rise and fall <b>of</b> the orographic <b>cloud</b> base, which was influenced in turn by synoptic weather conditions, the seasonal movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the north-easterly trade winds. Knowledge of the proportion of the time that sites are immersed in clouds should facilitate ecological comparisons and biogeographical analyses, as well as land use planning and hydrologic assessments in areas where intensive on-site work is not feasible...|$|R

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the influence of}} sampling biases on estimates of absolute density. Using area searches for birds on 1 -ha plots, we showed that time of day, weather and vegetation density (logged v. unlogged forest) had no {{significant impact on the}} detection rates of birds. As a consequence these environmental variables did not affect estimates of total bird density or <b>species</b> richness. Amount <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> cover was positively correlated with abundance <b>of</b> three <b>species</b> (white-browed scrubwren, inland thornbill and white-naped honeyeater) but negatively correlated with counts of the western gerygone. Radio-tracking of western yellow robins showed that about half of all birds present on a plot were detected during area searches. However, robins moved over an area twice as large as the plot searched. These errors compensate to give an accurate estimate of density for this species. Collectively, these results indicate that area searches give a reliable estimate of density in both logged and unlogged eucalypt forest...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} analyze the spatial {{distribution}} pattern of the tropical ash population, we used Ripley’s K function (Haase 1995; Soto et al. 2010), which is a tool for analyzing mapped spatial point process data and is frequently used to analyze spatial patterns of trees (Dixon 2002). It also shows {{the change in the}} spatial clustering or dispersion of the centroids of the entity when the size of the neighborhood changes (ArcGIS Resources 2014). The Ripley’s K function has been used to describe how point patterns <b>of</b> different plant <b>species</b> or forest landscape types occur over a specific area of interest and how they can change with scale (Dong et al. 2014; Fonton et al. 2011; Muvengwi et al. 2018).
