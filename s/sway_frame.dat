40|$|The {{advantage}} of second-order nonlinear analysis lies on {{its capacity to}} model actual structural response instead of making assumption on the structural behavior such as the arbitrary assumption of effective length factor. Considering the construction process of a structure, it may become a <b>sway</b> <b>frame</b> from a non-sway frame when a story is added or, on the contrary, to convert to a non-sway frame from a <b>sway</b> <b>frame</b> when bracings or infill walls are constructed and this makes the first-order linear analysis extremely inconvenient to use. Further, the deformation and load distributions of the structures considering the construction sequence can be much different from those obtained by assuming all structural elements share loads simultaneously. This paper proposes an advanced simulation-based design using an improved second-order analysis for structures accounting for both local and global imperfections, sequential loads and construction process. The technique for such an analysis is described and the error for ignoring the effects of sequential loads and construction procedure is quantified. Both the elastic and the plastic second-order analyses are used for comparison. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E

The global connection used is a top- and seat-angle with double web angle. The semi-rigid connections are modeled by implementing a rotational spring between the beam-to-column connection. The moment-rotation curve for each semi-rigid connection is established using the Kishi and Chen 10 power rule. The linear semi-rigid frame is analyzed using two linearized moment-rotation relationships, Rko and Rkb· The non-linear semi-rigid connection frame is analyzed using the moment-rotation curve as input.

The effect of the geometrical stiffness of the frame is completely excluded based on the assumption of the formation of a collapse mechanism at the advent of elastic instability. The computational aspect of the method is considered by performing an elastic analysis on two typical frames examples with fixed end conditions and beam to column, stiffness ratios. The analysis is reduced to setting up the stiffness matrices with the load matrix taken as zero, except for the lateral load Wh that is taken as unity for each floor level of the frame. A programme written in a simple form of basic is applied to carry out the analysis of the two frames and compute their critical loads. The validity of the proposed method is tested by comparing solutions obtained from the proposed study with those from numerical examples of other authors and are found to be sufficiently exact.

In a previous study of a simple <b>sway</b> <b>frame,</b> where randomness of the above variables was considered, fracture of the connections was found to result in the reduction of the frame’s lateral stiffness with an accompanying reduction of the natural frequency of the frame. In this paper, the linear elastic behaviour of a multi degree-of-freedom frame under earthquake loading is examined probabilistically {{as an extension of the}} previous investigation.

40|$|This thesis reports work on {{two aspects}} of framed structures: part I is {{concerned}} with sway frames and part II with the ductility of composite flush end plate connections. Part I has investigated the effect of adopting standardised end plate connections as the method of providing the load path between the structural members of a steelwork <b>sway</b> <b>frame.</b> Practical low to medium rise multi-storey frame geometries have been designed in accordance with limit state principles {{in conjunction with the}} Wind-Moment Method. Each frame was analysed by undertaking a second-order elastic-plastic computer analysis to ascertain their structural performance, with particular emphasis directed towards problems associated with stability and sway deflections. The computer simulation necessitated the formulation of a prediction equation that modeled the initial stiffness characteristics of the standard connections. This model has been verified by comparison with full scale experimental test results, mainly taken from the literature. The investigation confirms that standardised end plate connections provide levels of stiffness and resistance which enable unbraced steel frames to be safely designed by the Wind-Moment method. There are however certain frame geometries where serviceability considerations dictate that stiffening to the frame would be necessary, if the standardised end plate connections were used. Part II has investigated the ductility of five major axis composite flush end plate connections that incorporate nominally identical amounts of reinforcement in conjunction with either 457 or 533 serial size Universal Beams. Other variable parameters include end plate thickness and horizontal spacing of the rebars. The work was undertaken experimentally and the results analysed in the context of connection performance. The results have shown that it will not prove difficult to ensure virtually rigid behaviour of the overall composite connection, despite the use of relatively thin end plates.

Betonarme perdelerin analizi ve boyutlandırılması bir takım kurallar çerçevesinde yapılır. Kuvvet esaslı tasarımda, deprem yükü azaltma katsayısının dikkate alınması sebebiyle analiz sonucu bulunan kesit tesirleri betonarme boyutlandırılmasında doğrudan kullanılamaz. Bu noktada kapasite tasarım kuralları uygulanır ve analizden elde edilen kesit tesirleri çeşitli işlemler sonucu dikkate alınır. Analiz sonucu bulanan perde taban momenti, kritik perde yüksekliği ve moment zarfı tanımları dikkate alınarak boyutlandırma için kullanılacak tasarım moment değerine çevrilir.   Modern deprem yönetmeliklerinde, analizden elde edilen kesme kuvveti de tasarımda doğrudan kullanılamamaktadır. Perde tasarım kesme kuvvetini elde etmek için, perdenin moment kapasitesinin tasarım moment değerine oranı olan moment dayanım fazlalığı miktarında artırım yapmanın çoğu zaman yeterli olmadığını daha önce yapılan çalışmalar göstermiştir. Bunun birincil sebebi, depremin perdelerde oluşturduğu kesme kuvveti dağılımının, perdenin tabanında oluşan eğilme mafsalı sebebiyle değişmesidir. Perde kesme kuvvetindeki bu değişim kesme kuvveti dinamik büyütmesi olarak tanımlanır.   Perdelerde oluşan kesme kuvvetindeki dinamik büyütme, zaman tanım alanında doğrusal olmayan analiz ya da her itme adımında oluşan mafsallarla uyumlu mod şekillerini kullanan itme analizi yöntemleri uygulanarak dikkate alınabilmektedir. Ayrıca bu olgu, perdeler üzerinde yapılan dinamik deneylerde de izlenmiştir. Kesme kuvvetindeki bu büyütme, Deprem Bölgelerinde Yapılacak Binalar Hakkındaki Yönetmelik (2007), Eurocode 8, Yeni Zelanda Deprem Yönetmeliği ve Kanada Deprem Yönetmeliği gibi yönetmeliklerde farklı yaklaşımlarla dikkate alınmaktadır.   Deprem yönetmeliklerinde bulunan perde kesme kuvvetindeki dinamik büyütme katsayıları, konsol perdeler üzerinde yapılan parametrik çalışmalar sonucu ortaya atılmıştır. Bu tez kapsamında, konsol perdelerde yapılan parametrik çalışmalar perde-çerçeve sistemler için genişletilmiş ve konu ile ilgili öneriler yapılmıştır.

İlave olarak, bağ kirişli perdelerde de kesme kuvvetinde dinamik büyütme etkisi farklı bağ kirişi katkı oranlarına göre incelenmiştir. Çalışmada, parametrik çalışmanın müsaade ettiği ölçüde, literatürde kabul gören perde modelleriyle çalışılmıştır.

In {{the design}} of {{structural}} systems under earthquake loads, seismic load reduction factor or the so-called behavior factor is employed {{to take into account}} nonlinear behavior of the structural system globally as indicated in various seismic codes and guidelines used in high seismicity areas. This modification makes it possible to adopt linear analysis, avoiding the sophisticated nonlinear analysis. The seismic load reduction factor used in the modification of the seismic forces also includes the over-strength of the structural system due to the use of design strengths of materials instead of the actual strengths. The capacity design principle together with the load reduction factor is employed to avoid brittle failures in case of seismic effects of strong ground motions.   Advantages of shear walls in structural systems of buildings have long been recognized especially in earthquake prone regions. Because they have large lateral load capacity to increase the structural capacity of the structural system and large lateral rigidity to keep seismic damages in a minimum level. In {{the design of}} shear walls, wall base moment obtained from the structural analysis is used; then, design moment envelope is obtained by using the critical wall height definition. This concept proposes a linear envelope for the seismic bending moment demand, which is obtained by shifting vertically the moment demand of the linear analysis by the horizontal length of the wall. The main aim of design moment envelope is to limit the location of plastic deformations to the base region, while keeping the other parts of the wall elastic. On the other hand, for shear forces, a different capacity design concept is adopted which takes into account the flexural overstrength to increase the design shear by considering the results of the linear analysis. However, it is shown that, this increase in the design shear force is not enough to ensure ductile failure in case of seismic forces higher than the design ones, because nonlinear dynamic response changes patterns of lateral inertial forces. In other words, dominant mode shape changes with the formation of the base hinge that shifts the location of the resultant lateral forces downward. This phenomenon is called dynamic shear amplification or shear magnification and it is taken into account in the regular design globally by increasing the design shear forces, where flexural overstrength is considered separately as well. The study focuses on seismic shear force, bending moment and displacement demands on ductile cantilever walls and dual wall structures assuming that nonlinear deformations take place. In the first chapter literature review on the shear wall models and dynamic shear force amplification effect of shear walls are presented.   In the second chapter, verification of the analysis results of shear wall models, which are used in the analyses, with shear wall experiment results of the other researchers is carried out. Concrete and steel material models and fiber element model are presented. It is verified that the models are capable to simulate results of the monotonic and the cyclic wall tests with acceptable accuracy. The plastic deformations are included to the analysis in addition to elastic parts, by assuming fiber model. It is shown that the presented fiber modeling of RC walls provides an adequate representation of stiffness and strength behavior of the walls, which had been tested by previous researchers. Moreover, due to easy applicability of the presented fiber modeling, it can be used by engineers in practice as well as in detailed analysis. Constitutive material laws with hysteretic rules are implemented for concrete and steel fibers.   In the third chapter, nonlinear behavior of the cantilever shear walls are studied. In order to investigate the nonlinear behavior of reinforced concrete shear walls subjected to seismic loads and the extent of the related code requirements, an extensive parametric study is carried out. Shear walls having a height of 5, 10, 20 and 30 story and rectangular cross section are analyzed by considering four ductility levels and ten earthquake records having different levels of acceleration and frequency content. Variation of shear amplification depending on different values of the period and the ductility of the shear walls are investigated. As in most of the previous studies by others, nonlinear time-history analyses are performed for a constant flexural capacity along the entire height of the wall. Moreover, in the present study structural systems are analyzed where flexural capacity is assumed to vary with elevations along the height of the wall in order to make comparison between the variable flexural capacity and the constant flexural capacity along the height of the walls by adopting nonlinear dynamic analysis. Large number of numerical results obtained from the dynamic analyses indicate that for tall ductile shear walls in which the flexural capacity decrease along its height (as usual in everyday design practice) plastic hinges form above the base region of the shear walls. It is observed that the base shear force and the shear force profile on the shear wall do not change dramatically for the different capacity variations of the shear walls. Furthermore, existing top displacement-base curvature relationships which are used in displacement-based design are investigated. It is found that, contribution of the elastic displacement to the total top displacement is significantly higher than expected and should not be neglected. In the fourth chapter, shear demand of reinforced concrete walls in dual structural systems is investigated. Behavior of the dual wall-frame system under lateral load is different from a single cantilever shear wall and a <b>sway</b> <b>frame</b> system as well. Dual systems combine the advantages of the shear walls and the frame systems. Under the action of lateral forces, frame will deform primarily in a shear mode as a result of flexural deformation, whereas a wall will behave like a vertical cantilever with primary flexural deformations. Due to the compatibility of deformations, the resultant behavior is that of an interaction of the wall and the frame. In the chapter three, it is pointed out that moment and shear force distributions in shear walls, obtained by using nonlinear dynamic analysis, display a variation different from the distribution used in the design procedure. Due to this difference, the maximum shear demand in the shear walls during an earthquake is generally higher than that computed by using linear dynamic and static analysis. In this chapter, the nonlinear behavior of the wall-frame system has been examined by using nonlinear analysis to observe the dynamic amplification of shear force in shear walls. Large numbers of numerical analyses are carried out on structural systems consisting of various combinations of walls and frames. Relationships between the shear amplification with the period and the displacement ductility have been studied depending on the contributing of the shear walls. Numerical results are presented in figures for comparison and steps of the performance evaluation methods are critically discussed. For this purpose, 5, 10, 20 and 30 story planar dual RC structural systems are designed. Later, these buildings are analyzed using the nonlinear dynamic analysis by assuming that they are subjected to ten earthquake records of far-field earthquakes that are scaled based on the elastic code spectra. The numerical results including the relation between the coefficient of dynamic amplification of shear forces in shear walls and the period and the load reduction factor of the structural systems are presented. In the fifth chapter, the results of the presented study are summarized and recommendations for future studies are underlined. DoktoraPh...|$|E

Many topics have been addressed, current design approaches examined and new design methods proposed to allow for such effects based upon a first order linear elastic analysis, which is the most commonly used in normal design. These topics are as follows: 1) The well known amplified sway method (see BS 5950 : 1985 : Part 1) which can be used to incorporate the effect of the presence of axial loads on the behaviour of <b>sway</b> <b>frames</b> was studied. A modification to this method has been proposed and the validity of the proposed method was checked using an existing computer program [1] to verify the proposed method against a second order analysis. 2) The influence of the action of semi-rigid connections on frame behaviour was examined and the need to conduct a systematic investigation into the problem verified. A simple hand calculation method to incorporate this influence to any of the conventional design methods has been proposed. A second computer program [2] was slightly modified to suit the university of Sheffield IBM 3083 mainframe machine and this program was later used in this study. 3) The stiffening effect due to partial sway bracing resulting from the presence of block or brickwork walls in a practical multistorey frame accompanied by the weakening effect due to the finite stiffness of semi-rigid joints on frame serviceability was investigated and a suitable design method is recommended. 4) The behaviour of columns in <b>sway</b> <b>frames</b> with and without partial sway bracing, resulting from the presence of infill panels in practical frames, has been examined. Design charts which can be used to predict a reasonably conservative estimation of the inelastic ultimate load of a framed column in a sway structure are given.

The effective length factor is employed to facilitate the design of framed members by transforming an end-restrained compressive member to an equivalent pinned-ended member.

40|$|In this paper, {{a genetic}} {{algorithm}} is proposed for discrete minimal weight design of steel planar frames with semi-rigid beam-tocolumn connections. The frame elements are constructed from a predetermined range of section profiles. Conventionally, the analysis of frame structures {{is based on the}} assumption that all connections are either frictionless pinned or fully rigid. Recent limit state specifications permit the concept of semi-rigid connection of the individual frame members in the structural design. In a frame with semi-rigid joints the loading will create both a bending moment and a relative rotation between the connected members. The moment and relative rotation are related through a constitutive law which depends on the joint properties. The effect, at the global analysis stage, of having semi-rigid joints instead of rigid or pinned joints will be to modify not only the displacements but also the distribution of the internal forces in the structure. In this study, a simplified beam-to-column connection is presented which was specified in EC 3 Annex J. In order to capture the changes in the nodal force and moment distribution in terms of joint flexibility, the ANSYS finite element analysis is applied.

It was established that four percent cement stabilized laterite block, compacted at its optimum moisture content and dry density produced the best combination of physical and mechanical properties as the tensile, shear and boned strengths for the four percent cement stabilized laterite blocks meet the minimum Code specifications for sandcrete and brick blocks.

The strength and failure mechanism of a one-quarter scale model reinforced concrete frame infilled with four percent cement stabilized laterite block followed the trend established for sandcrete and brick infills with the sway resistance capacity of the frame increasing by about 300 %.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} {{problems}} related to the non-linear behaviour of plane steel frames and especially the problem of flexural buckling and the flexible response exhibited by such structures when they are subjected to lateral loads. The main objective of the thesis is to propose ways for improving the accuracy of approximate methods for tackling these nonlinear issues by means of linear analyses. Thus, it is attempted to reliably assess the strength of multi-story steel plane frames, associated with non-linear behaviour, by conducting linear analyses. The {{main part of the}} thesis deals with the improvement of the effective buckling length method for the evaluation of the elastic critical buckling load of columns in multi-story frames. It is pointed out that the effective buckling length can be used for the evaluation of the slenderness and, subsequently, the ultimate strength of the corresponding members subjected to various types of actions according to the code provisions. Next, an easy to use method is presented for the estimation of the importance of second order effects in the behavior of steel frames and the evaluation of the amplification factor α, {{to be used as a}} multiplier of stresses and strains obtained from linear analysis, in order to avoid carrying out a non-linear analysis, at least at a preliminary design stage. Furthermore, an initial attempt to investigate the interaction of compressive axial forces and bending moments in steel members is presented. Finally, the influence of the direction of imperfections as well as material nonlinearity on the buckling capacity of “gama”-shape <b>sway</b> <b>frames</b> is investigated. ...|$|R

40|$|In Eurocode 4, {{design rules}} are {{suggested}} {{for the evaluation}} of the mechanical properties of structural steel-concrete composite joints (rotational stiffness, resistance and ductility). These rules cover situations where the joints are subjected to moments and shear forces, but in hogging regions only. Recently, researches have been conducted on the behaviour of composite joints subjected to sagging bending moments and to combined bending moments and axial loads, types of loadings which appear in composite frame further to a column loss. In the present paper, recent developments allowing to extend the EC 4 design rules to joints in sagging regions (loading which can occur, for instance, in <b>sway</b> composite <b>frames)</b> are presented and the proposed method is validated through comparisons with experimental test results. Also, an easy-to-apply design software (which will be freely available), applying the rules recommended in Eurocode 4 in a safe and easy way, is described. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{ultimate}} strength testing of space steel frame accounting for local buckling was performed. Considering {{a majority of}} large-scale frame tests in the past, only two-dimensional frames or three-dimensional frames comprised of compact section are experimentally studied. Therefore, three-dimensional experiments accounting for local buckling are needed to extend the knowledge of this field. Three two-story, single-bay, and <b>sway</b> allowed <b>frames</b> consisting of non-compact section subjected to proportional vertical and horizontal loads were tested. The details of the test frames, test instruments, and test procedures are presented. The load–displacement curves of the test frames are provided. The experiment results are useful for verification of the three-dimensional analytical models. It was observed that the load carrying capacities calculated by the AISC-LRFD method were 13 – 21 % conservative when {{compared with those of}} the experiment. This difference is attributed {{to the fact that the}} AISC-LRFD approach does not consider the inelastic moment redistribution but the experiment includes the inelastic redistribution effect...|$|R

40|$|Large scale fire {{tests and}} {{observations}} of actual building fires {{have shown that}} the fire performance of composite steel framed buildings is much better than is indicated by fire resistance tests on isolated elements. This contribution presents application of a simple design method, so-called FRACOF concept, for the analysis of non <b>sway</b> steel <b>framed</b> buildings with composite floors. Starting point were the outstanding results obtained in the BRE Cardington large scale building fire test programme carried out during 1995 and 1996. The method was further validated by large-scale standard furnace tests in 2008 and 2009, as well as with natural fire tests in 2010. A recent test has also shown the possibility of application of this concept to composite floors with castellated beams. The recommendations are in line with the reliability level imposed by current design rules and are limited to structures similar to that tested. The method permits designers to spare the fire protection for the framing elements for which it is not needed by keeping the same safety requirement than traditional codes. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, modern {{codes and}} {{standards}} such as the (Eurocode 4, 2004) deal with the characterisation of steel–concrete composite joints in building structures, mainly under hogging bending moments in the beam. However, in <b>sway</b> composite <b>frames</b> or when the composite structure is subjected to an accidental/exceptional event such as earthquake or column loss, the beam-to-column joint may be subjected to sagging bending moment, a loading situation which is not yet covered by the codes. This paper deals with the behaviour of composite beam-to-column external joints under sagging bending moments, mainly focusing on the specific joint component “concrete slab in compression”. Indeed, if reference is made to Eurocodes, the method recommended to characterise structural joints is the component method and the “concrete slab in compression” component {{has been identified as}} the missing component to be able to apply this method to composite joints subjected to sagging bending moment. In this article, the finite element method is used to model the slab using VecTor 2 software. Through the performed numerical simulations, the behaviour of the slab is studied in detail and an analytical model is proposed. With the proposed model, it is possible to characterise the concrete slab in compression component and so, to apply the component method to predict the mechanical properties of composite joints subjected to sagging bending moment.

40|$|Eurocode 4 is the European {{design code}} for {{composite}} construction; in its so-called ENV version, the scope {{is limited to}} "nonsway buildings" with efficient bracing systems. Therefore, it gives mainly rules to analyze and to check structural elements like beams, columns, slabs, and joints. However, in the last years, the construction of taller buildings and larger industrial halls without wind bracing systems is susceptible to make global instability a relevant failure mode, which is not covered by Eurocode 4. For 3 years, {{in the framework of}} a European research project funded by the European Community for Steel and Coal, in which the Univ. of Liege was deeply involved, intensive experimental, numerical, and theoretical investigations have been carried out. The latter aimed at improving the knowledge in the field of <b>sway</b> composite <b>frames</b> and at developing appropriate design rules. The rotational behavior of the beam-to-column composite joints {{is one of the key}} aspects of the problem to which special attention has been paid. This paper presents the numerical and analytical studies carried out at Liege Univ., as part of above European project, with the objective to investigate the behavior of sway composite structures under static loading. Particular phenomena put into sight through different analyses are illustrated herein. The actual response of the beam-to-column composite joints may be easily integrated into the described design and analysis procedures; this specific aspect is therefore not addressed in the paper.
