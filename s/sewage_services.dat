2500|$|Typically {{drinking}} water and <b>sewage</b> <b>services</b> are provided by different entities. In 2007 there were 1,572 water utilities and 3,699 sewage utilities in Japan. The number of sewage utilities {{is higher than the}} number of municipalities, which was only 1,804 down from 3,232 in 1999. The higher number of utilities may be because the merger of utilities lagged behind the merger of municipalities. Utilities can be either companies operating under commercial principles, subject to the Local Public Enterprise Law, or departments of local government subject to the government accounting system. Most water utilities but only few [...] sewer utilities (213) are commercially operated companies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the impact of a natural {{disaster}} on the mental health of a rural Maya community in the Philippines.
