40|$|The {{occurrence}} of edge loading in hip joint replacement {{has been associated}} with many factors such as prosthetic design, component malposition and activities of daily living. The present study aimed to quantify the {{occurrence of}} edge loading/contact at the articulating surface and to evaluate the effect of cup angles and edge loading on the contact mechanics of a modular metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) total hip replacement (THR) during different daily activities. A three-dimensional finite element model was developed based on a modular MoP bearing system. Different cup inclination and anteversion angles were modelled and six daily activities were considered. The results showed that edge loading was predicted during normal walking, ascending and descending stairs activities under steep cup inclination conditions (≥ 55 °) while no edge loading was observed during standing up, sitting down and knee bending activities. The duration of edge loading increased with increased cup inclination angles and was affected by the cup anteversion angles. Edge loading caused elevated contact pressure at the articulating surface and <b>substantially</b> increased <b>equivalent</b> plastic strain of the polyethylene liner. The present study suggested that correct positioning the component to avoid edge loading that may occur during daily activities is important for MoP THR in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|Optical {{and thermal}} {{characteristics}} of domed skylights {{are important to}} solve the trade-off between daylighting and thermal design. However, {{there is a lack}} of daylighting and thermal design tools for domed skylights. Optical and thermal characteristics of transparent single-glazed hemispherical domed skylights under sun and sky light are evaluated based on an optical model for domed skylights. The optical model is based on tracking the beam and diffuse radiation transmission through the dome surface. A simple method is proposed to replace single-glazed hemispherical domed skylights by optically and thermally equivalent single-glazed planar skylights to accommodate limitations of energy computer programs. Under sunlight, single-glazed hemispherical domed skylights yield slightly lower equivalent solar transmittance and solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) at near normal zenith angles than those of single-glazed planar skylights. However, single-glazed hemispherical domed skylights yield <b>substantially</b> higher <b>equivalent</b> solar transmittance and SHGC at high zenith angles and around the horizon. Under isotropic skylight, single-glazed hemispherical domed skylights yield slightly lower equivalent solar transmittance and SHGC than those of single-glazed planar skylights. Daily solar heat gains of singleglazed hemispherical domed skylights are higher than those of single-glazed horizontal planar skylights in both winter and summer season. In summer, the solar heat gain of single-glazed hemispherical domed skylights can reach 3 % to 9 % higher than those of horizontal single-glazed planar skylights for latitudes varying between 0 and 55 (north/south).

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the isotopic scrambling in the energized and metastable complex D 2 O-H 3 O+ has been studied using classical molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories starting from regions of phase space corresponding to an already formed collisional complex. The simulations cover the range of internal energies spanned by gas phase collision experiments. Rate constants for the isotopic exchange and the complex dissociation have been computed; the isotopic branching ratio R=[HD 2 O+]/[H 2 DO+] has also been obtained from MD simulations and found to deviate <b>substantially</b> from an <b>equivalent</b> prediction based on a previously proposed kinetic scheme. This finding suggests the possibility that details of the reaction dynamics {{play a role in}} defining the isotopic branching ratio. The analysis of trajectory results indicated a relatively long lifetime for the collisional complex and the presence of multiple time scales for the exchange process, with a large fraction of the exchange events being separated only by a single oxygen-oxygen vibration or half of it. The occurrence of these fast consecutive jumps and their different probabilities {{as a function of the}} relative direction between first and second jumps suggest the presence of ballistic motion in the complex following each reactive event.

40|$|The rate of {{transfer}} of reducing equivalents from cytoplasm to mitochondria has been examined in Ehrlich ascites tumour cells incubated {{in the presence}} of lactate. The flux of reducing equivalents was determined from the rate of metabolism of reduced intermediates that are oxidized within the cytosol. The magnitude of the flux of reducing equivalents was dependent on both the concentration of added lactate and the presence of carbohydrate. The rate of flux was twice as great {{in the presence of}} glucose and four times as high when glucose and lactate were added together as when lactate was the only added substrate. Fructose was less effective than glucose in stimulating reducing equivalent flux. In the presence of glucose or fructose, there was a substantial accumulation of hexose phosphates, dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glycerol 3 -phosphate. Rotenone, an inhibitor of NADH dehydrogenase, and amino-oxyacetate, which inhibits the malate/aspartate shuttle, were powerful suppressors of reducing equivalent flux from lactate as sole substrate, but were much less potent in the presence of carbohydrate. Antimycin <b>substantially</b> inhibited reducing <b>equivalent</b> flux from all combinations of added substrates, consistent with its ability to block oxidation of reducing equivalents transferred by both the malate/aspartate and glycerol 3 -phosphate shuttles.
