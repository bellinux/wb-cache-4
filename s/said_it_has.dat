5|$|Scientology is {{represented}} by {{a large number of}} independent associations or Vereine in Germany; their umbrella organisation is the Scientology Kirche Deutschland e.V. Germany's domestic intelligence service, the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution), estimates that there are 4,000 Scientologists in Germany, down from earlier estimates of 5,000 to 6,000. The Church of Scientology reported around 30,000 members from the mid-1990s onwards; this number remained stable for many years. However more recently Scientology has <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> only 12,000 members. Discrepancies in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures, essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses, regardless of their subsequent involvement. The number of contractually bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred.|$|E

[...] Robert Christgau from The Village Voice <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> [...] "four groundbreaking masterworks" [...] in [...] "I Ain't No Joke", [...] "I Know You Got Soul", [...] "Paid in Full", and [...] "Eric B. Is President", but was less enthusiastic about the other six songs: [...] "They're pure, innovative, in-your-face—no doubt. But they're also turntablism with spoken decoration, of small use to anyone who hasn't internalized the 'real' hip hop aesthetic."

500|$|In 2005, {{according}} to an interview with David Fricke of Rolling Stone, Jack began working on songs for the band's next album at his home. He played with different techniques than in past albums, trading in his electric guitar for an acoustic on {{all but a few}} of the tracks, as his trademark riff-based lead guitar style is overtaken by a predominantly rhythmic approach. The White Stripes' fifth album, Get Behind Me Satan, was released in 2005 on the V2 label. The title is an allusion to a Biblical quotation Jesus made to the Apostle Simon Peter from the [...] of the New Testament (in the King James Version, the quotation is slightly different: [...] "Get thee behind me, Satan"). Jack has <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a double meaning: that Satan should physically be behind him or that Satan should support him. Another theory about this title is that Jack and Meg White read James Joyce's story collection [...] "Dubliners" [...] (published 1914) and used a line from the final story [...] "The Dead" [...] to title this album.|$|E

500|$|Anime News Network's Carlo Santos {{said that}} the series walks [...] "the line between serious sleuth drama and supernatural spell-fest", [...] "balancing all that with the {{occasional}} joke".

Serdar Yegulalp from About.com <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> [...] "n interesting concept", is [...] "competent enough", and [...] "has a few fun twists", but that apart from the supernatural elements it does not bring anything that has not already been done in Case Closed. Writing for Mania.com, Chris Beveridge said the anime operates principally around the two main characters; he said that it is [...] "more interesting to watch how Neuro and Yako operate, to understand methods and personalities, more than the actual event. And that weakens the episode because it never feels like we're really drawn into the mystery itself." [...] Beveridge added it [...] "has some good production values", but criticized Neuro's appearance, [...] "which is bordering on comical" [...] as it makes it difficult for the series [...] "to go a darker route".|$|E

[...] GameTrailers <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a [...] "pretty cool story" [...] that will [...] "definitely feel familiar". Parkin, however, stated the [...] "game's primary problem...is in its in-built focus" [...] and that the series [...] "is principally concerned with endlessly upping the ante."

500|$|The Telegraph <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> seen {{documents}} {{indicating a}} [...] "Mr Sagawa" [...] was {{a director of}} Axam Investments and Axes America that received a $687million advisory fee for the Gyrus acquisition. The Financial Times said its principals were former Nomura employees. The link to the scam caused Nomura shares to fall, though the bank denied involvement, claiming it was [...] "based on speculation and not on fact". Akio Nakagawa and Hajime Sagawa, both of whom started their careers at Nomura Securities and were also colleagues at Drexel Burnham Lambert and PaineWebber, were behind Axes, according to Reuters. Nakagawa, who was once head of equities at PaineWebber in Japan in the early 1990s, had long-standing relationship with Olympus. A former Paine Webber banker attested that Nakagawa and Sagawa were handlers for Olympus, and they made use of Bermuda-based funds valued at [...] "hundreds of millions of dollars" [...] to manage its balance sheet using Japanese accounting loopholes. Axes America, having negotiated the success fee for Gyrus in a combination of cash and stock, then transferred the stock component to AXAM Investments, an affiliate registered in the Cayman Islands. In 2010, the stock was sold back to Olympus for $620million.|$|E

[...] The Evening Chronicles review said it [...] "conceals few narrative surprises" [...] but contended that [...] "when [...] does finally defy our expectations, it's to ensure his spellers learn a valuable lesson about integrity." [...] Turan of the Los Angeles Times criticized that the film [...] "telegraphs its plot"; however, he praised it as [...] "genuinely sweet and determinedly inspirational." [...] PopMatterss Cynthia Fuchs stated it is formulaic as it has some [...] "conventions that make so many other genre films feel stale," [...] but that it [...] "torques them slightly", emphasizing the [...] "intellectual activities" [...] Akeelah gets involved with. Furthermore, the film was described as [...] "derivatively entertaining in a feel-good sort of way" [...] by Rick Groen in an article for The Globe and Mail. Ingman of The Austin Chronicle {{described it as a}} typical sports film and felt it was heavy-handed at times. However, she praised it for its thems and called the film a [...] "houghtful, engaging," [...] one and <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> [...] "cross-gender appeal". Morris of The Boston Globe argued, [...] "If Akeelah and the Bee is a generic, well-oiled commercial contraption, it is the first to credibly dramatize the plight of a truly gifted, poor black child." [...] Morris added, [...] "Obviously, it's emotional propaganda. But it's just the kind of propaganda our children need." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's only cover song, [...] "California Sun", was {{originally}} written by Henry Glover and Morris Levy, and performed by The Rivieras. While the lyrics and musical structure {{remain the same}} throughout the piece, Joey's pronunciation upon words significantly lessened the similarity to the original song. The sound output tone also differs from the original, with more distortion {{as well as a}} faster tempo. Author Steve Waksman relates: [...] "From the opening bars, 'California Sun' becomes subject to the Ramones' distinctive brand of musical minimalism paired with sonic excess. The chords go by in a blur of distortion; the drums and bass kick at seemingly twice the speed of the Rivieras." [...] The twelfth track [...] "Commando" [...] has a theme which deals with war movies and contains multiple military references. Author Avram Mednick said the song was a successor to [...] "Blitzkrieg Bop", released on the band's debut album. He also noted that it has a [...] "bouncy melody and an infectious call-and-response chorus." [...] "You're Gonna Kill that Girl", which was written very early in the band's career, was also rooted in doo-wop genre. Mednick commented that it appealed highly to those tuning into the Ramones in the UK, and also <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a [...] "lovely misogynistic tune." [...] The final guitar chord on the track is played by drummer Tommy since Johnny rarely played acoustic. The album's final track, [...] "You Should Never Have Opened That Door", was written by Dee Dee and Johnny, and circles themes of horror films and hints that people in these movies tend to be naïve and unintelligent.|$|E
500|$|Alan Scherstuhl wrote a very {{critical}} piece for The Village Voice; {{he called the}} film predictable and repetitive, and said it contained several facts that have been clearly [...] "common knowledge for years". Scherstuhl said it is scattershot, [...] "a litany of Things We Can All Agree Are Bad", but ultimately jumps between several topicswithout sufficient detail, in his opinionbut comes to no conclusion or alternative. Scherstuhl said not even common people would have their beliefs challenged {{and that they would}} [...] "dismiss it as the vague liberal agitprop that it is". Similarly, while saying the film discusses important issues, both Genevieve Koski of The Dissolve and Jennie Kermode of Eye for Film said it deals with several themes quickly but does not expand upon any of them. Koski said, [...] "The True Cost is methodical to a fault", while Kermode said it is [...] "a good starting point" [...] on the topic. Fashion critic Vanessa Friedman <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> an [...] "easy-to-swallow accessibility" [...] but that it [...] "oversimplifies" [...] some aspects of the industry. In addition to commenting on the lack of attribution for [...] "lots of eye-popping statements", she said, [...] "trying to do everything, he skirted a lot of things". The Los Angeles Timess Martin Tsai criticized Morgan for interviewing his own executive producers, saying [...] "the effects of fertilizers...don't appear quite as tangible", and faulted Morgan for not exploring [...] "retailer markups that could have gone toward improving sweatshop conditions instead of profit margins", but appreciated that he had interviewed people with both pro and con views. Lizzie Crocker of The Daily Beast said Morgan had socialist views and that the film implies he wants {{to go back to the}} 1960s. She also criticized some interviewees, such as Miller, whom she called a [...] "conspiracy theorist", and Wolff, whom she called a [...] "Marxist idealist". Crocker was dismissive of the film, saying, [...] "the film loses focus and credibility, criticizing not just the fashion industry but the global capitalist system that supports it".|$|E
