40|$|Traditionally, roscas in Japan {{have been}} called mujin-ko or tanomoshi-ko. Authors note that roscas have roots in Buddhist traditions and were present in Japan as early as 1255. The mujin {{gradually}} became commercialized {{in the form of}} partnerships and joint-stock companies. Later some mujin evolved into small finance companies that provided loans to small- and medium-sized companies. Still later, they evolved into <b>sogo</b> (mutual) <b>banks.</b> More recently, <b>sogo</b> <b>banks</b> have merged and some have become commercial banks. The authors could have mentioned, but didn’t, a parallel evolution from roscas to the financial services in farmers associations in Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. I wonder why we haven’t seen a similar evolution in other countries—or have we? [...] where roscas have a long histor...|$|R
5000|$|At the epicenter, the [...] "big six" [...] {{keiretsu}} is a {{bank and}} a trading company (<b>sogo</b> shosha). Japanese <b>banks</b> are allowed to have equity in other firms with a quota of less than 5% {{of the total number}} of shares issued by the company (Anti-Monopoly Law Reform of 1977). Banks play a crucial role in the smooth functioning of this organization. They assess the investment projects and provide loans when required. The trading companies (sogo sosha) deal in imports and exports of an assorted range of commodities throughout the world. Each major company has its own [...] "President's Club", enabling interaction of core members to better help decide their strategies.|$|R
50|$|The current Michinoku Bank {{can trace}} its origins to 1894, when the Aomori Shogyo Bank was established. In 1976, Seiwa Bank, the {{successor}} to the Aomori Shogyo Bank, merged with the Hirosaki <b>Sogo</b> <b>Bank</b> to form the current Michinoku Bank. In January 1980, Michinoku adopted the use of Tom and Jerry as mascots for the bank. These mascots were used until 2004, when the bank decided to stop using the characters in order to rehabilitate its image as the “Tom and Jerry Bank.” In 1995, Michinoku opened a representative office in Yuzhno-Sakhalin, and four years later established a subsidiary in Moscow.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, the Heiwa <b>Sogo</b> <b>Bank</b> {{started a}} resort venture and floated plans for {{construction}} of the national oil reserve on the island, but neither plan came to fruition. In March 1980, the last resident left the island.In 1995, a subsidiary of Tateishi Construction acquired the island, and announced plans to construct a landing field for the Japanese space shuttle, HOPE-X, on the island. Other plans to establish a spent nuclear fuel storage facility were also announced. However, subsequently no construction has been taken and the HOPE-X project itself was cancelled in 2003. In 2009, Mageshima came under consideration as a possible relocation site for the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in Ginowan, Okinawa, {{or at least as}} a site for the United States Navy to relocate its aircraft carrier aircraft touch-and-go training. However, Tateishi Construction subsequently came under investigation for tax fraud and for collusion with politicians over the project. Initial logging to clear an area for the proposed runways was performed without proper permission, and in September 2011 local fishermen filed lawsuits alleging damage to fishing grounds due to increased runoff created by the illegal logging.|$|E
