40|$|Variations of {{frequency}} <b>separations</b> of low-degree p-modes are studied over the solar activity cycle. The <b>separations</b> studied are {{obtained from the}} frequencies of low-degree p-modes of the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG). 10. 7 cm radio flux is used as an index of solar activity. Small <b>separations</b> of the p-mode frequencies {{are considered to be}} mainly dependent on the conditions in stellar interiors. Thus they could be applied to diagnose the changes in the stellar interior. Our calculation results show that the magnitudes of variations of the mean large <b>separations</b> are less than 1 σ over the solar activity cycle. Small <b>separations</b> show different behaviors in the ascending and descending phases of activity. In the ascending phase, variations of the small <b>separations</b> are less than 1 σ. However, the small <b>separations</b> have systematic shifts during 2004 - 2007. The shifts are roughly 1 σ or more. The variations of the ratios of the small to large <b>separations</b> with time are similar to the changes of the small <b>separations.</b> The effects of the changes in the large <b>separations</b> on the ratios are negligible. The variations of the <b>separations</b> may be a consequence of the influence from the surface activity or systematic errors in measurements or some processes taking place in the solar interior.

40|$|Presents an {{overview}} of admitted patient activity in Australia’s public and private hospitals. Summary How much admitted patient care was provided? In 2013 - 14, {{there were more than}} 9. 7 million <b>separations</b> from hospitals- 5. 7 million in public hospitals and 4. 0 million in private hospitals. Between 2009 - 10 and 2013 - 14, the number of <b>separations</b> increased by 3. 3 % on average each year; by 3. 0 % for public hospitals and by 3. 6 % for private hospitals. This was greater than the average increase in population over this period (1. 6 %). Almost 27. 9 million days of patient care were reported for admitted patients- 18. 8 million in public hospitals and 9. 1 million in private hospitals. Between 2009 - 10 and 2013 - 14, days of patient care increased by about 1 % on average each year. Who used these services? In 2013 - 14, 53 % of <b>separations</b> were for females and 40 % of <b>separations</b> were for people aged 65 and over. There were about 408, 000 <b>separations</b> for Indigenous Australians, who were hospitalised at more than twice the rate for other Australians (896 and 384 per 1, 000 population, respectively). Why did people receive care? In 2013 - 14, about 94 % of <b>separations</b> were for acute care and 4 % for rehabilitation care. About 6 % of hospitalisations were potentially preventable and a further 6 % of <b>separations</b> were for injury or poisoning. The most common single reason for care was dialysis for kidney disease (1. 3 million <b>separations).</b> Between 2009 - 10 and 2013 - 14, <b>separations</b> for dialysis increased by 3. 9 % on average each year. What services were provided? In 2013 - 14, about 57 % of <b>separations</b> were for medical care, 25 % were for surgical care and about 3 % each were for childbirth and specialised mental health care. Public hospitals provided the majority of medical <b>separations</b> (73 %) and emergency admissions (79 %). Private hospitals accounted for 60 % of surgical <b>separations,</b> 58 % of specialised mental health <b>separations</b> and 53 % of non-emergency admissions. In 2013 - 14, about 2 % of public hospital <b>separations</b> involved a stay in an intensive care unit. About 9. 4 million hours of intensive care were reported for public hospitals. What procedures were performed? In 2013 - 14, about 19. 1 million procedures were reported. About 75 % of public hospital <b>separations</b> and 95 % of private hospital <b>separations</b> involved a procedure. In 2013 - 14, there were 305, 000 emergency admissions involving surgery. The most common emergency surgery performed was appendicectomy. Between 2009 - 10 and 2013 - 14, elective admissions involving surgery rose by an average of 2. 3 % per year; by 1. 4 % for public hospitals and by 2. 7 % for private hospitals. What was the safety and quality of the care? In 2013 - 14, about 8. 8 % of <b>separations</b> recorded a condition with onset during the hospital stay.
