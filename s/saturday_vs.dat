50|$|The club runs a {{range of}} events {{throughout}} the year. On the cricket side, the intra-club Twenty20 day has proved very popular. The last game of each season is the keenly fought Club Match. This has traditionally been a <b>Saturday</b> <b>vs</b> Sunday affair, but with the better players gravitating to the League side, a new format was introduced in 2009 of 'Greys' (being over 35) vs 'Kids'. A recent addition to the calendar is Presidents Day. This {{is seen as an}} opportunity to say 'thank you' to our benefactors and features the Sunday team taking on a Select XI.|$|E
50|$|In a huge {{study in}} 2012 by Freemantle et al., 14,217,640 admissions (all types) were assessed. Admission on weekend days was {{associated}} {{with an increase in}} risk of subsequent death compared with admission on weekdays. Hazard ratio for Sunday vs Wednesday 1.16 (95% CI 1.14-1.18; p<0.0001), and for <b>Saturday</b> <b>vs</b> Wednesday 1.11 (95% CI 1.09-1.13; p<.0001). Also in 2012, Lee et al., in Malaysia, studied 126,627 patients admitted to a single hospital. The group found that there was a statistically significant increased risk of mortality for those patients admitted during weekends (OR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.14-1.31) and out-of-hours on a weekday (OR = 1.67; 95% CI 1.57-1.78). As well as the effect of the weekend, there is a considerable literature on the effect of being admitted 'out-of-hours'. This effect is seen during the week and at weekends. This study by Lee is such a paper. The degree of effect is usually higher for the 'Out-of-Hours Effect' rather than the 'Weekend Effect'. This suggests that the 'weekend effect' may be {{nothing to do with the}} weekend per se, but may be caused by varying staff levels, and less intensive working practices, outside the '9-5 window'.|$|E

50|$|In a 2016 Australian study (Singla et al.), of 7718 {{elective}} and non-elective patients, it {{was shown}} that unadjusted and adjusted odds of early surgical mortality was higher on the weekend, compared to weekdays (unadjusted and adjusted OR = 1.30 (p<0.001) and 1.19 (p=0.026), respectively). When separated by day of week, there was a trend for higher surgical mortality on Friday, <b>Saturday</b> and Sunday <b>vs</b> all other days, although this did not reach statistical significance.|$|R

Valente’s novel Deathless (2011) to investigate what remains of Russian folk culture after it passes through the crucible of the Bolshevik Revolution. Koschei the Deathless’s seeming deathlessness, his death, and his perpetual reappearance draw critical attention to what is deemed to be “essential” to the Russian cultural imaginary and to the people participating in the imaginative work of cultural construction...|$|R
