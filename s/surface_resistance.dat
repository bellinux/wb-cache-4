In this paper, we evaluate the performance of four connectivity modeling approaches applied to two <b>resistance</b> <b>surfaces</b> in predicting the locations of highway crossings by American black bears in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. We found that a <b>resistance</b> <b>surface</b> derived directly from movement data greatly outperformed a <b>resistance</b> <b>surface</b> produced from analysis of genetic differentiation, despite their heuristic similarities.

40|$|Abstract. Different {{non-destructive}} {{tests have}} been proposed to control the quality of constructions which are being built and to evaluate the performance level of existing construction. Among these tests, determination of <b>surface</b> electrical <b>resistance</b> of the concrete by using a fully integrated 4 -point Wenner probe is really beneficial due to its simplicity, low cost and good relationship {{with the results of}} various parameters related to the durability and strength of the concrete. This study examined the relationship between <b>surface</b> electrical <b>resistance</b> and compressive strength of the concrete. To achieve this goal, the concrete specimens with a ratio of water to cementations materials, grade of cement materials and different alternative cementations materials were made and they have been tested by compressive strength and the <b>surface</b> electrical <b>resistance</b> in different ages. In fact, the concrete <b>surface</b> electrical <b>resistance</b> is dependent on two main parameters including; the structure of cement paste pores and chemical properties of pore water. Due to the impact of the cement paste porosity on the concrete compressive strength, this study showed that the compressive strength can be carefully estimated indirectly by keeping other parameters constant though the <b>surface</b> electrical <b>resistance</b> in a specific concrete. However, in case of using alternative cement materials, regarding their actions, enough opportunity to do pozzolanic reactions of the second step is given t...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the documented study was to manufacture transparent electrically conductive coatings by means of plasma activated processes. During the project, coatings were produced from two different groups of starting substances (monomers and precursors). The first group includes hydrocarbons such as acetylene that permitted the production of antistatic protective coatings having <b>surface</b> <b>resistances</b> as low as 10 " 7 Ohm. These coatings, however, exhibited no particularly high optical transparency. The second group under investigation were organometallic compounds permitting the production of electrically conductive, predominantly oxidic coatings having <b>surface</b> <b>resistances</b> of down to 300 Ohm. These coatings exhibited high optical transparencies of more than 90 %. The same substances were used to produce highly conductive, but non-transparent metallic coatings. Using additional silicon-organic substances as monomers in the transparent coatings mentioned above {{it was possible to}} obtain improved scratch protection properties of the coatings. (orig.)

50|$|The Earth's nominal {{magnetic}} flux of 0.5 gauss (50 µT) translates to {{a magnetic field}} of 0.5 Oe (40 A/m) and would produce a residual <b>surface</b> <b>resistance</b> in a superconductor that is orders of magnitude greater than the BCS resistance, rendering the superconductor too lossy for practical use.

40|$|Energy efﬁciency retroﬁt of {{buildings}} represents a key effort in reducing EU energy demand by 20 % by 2020. However, predictions tend to overestimate savings by large percentages. The shortfall in savings {{can be attributed}} to incorrect predictive techniques, comfort takeback along with other behavioural and workmanship variables. Common predictive techniques related to heat loss tend {{to be based on the}} U-value of the building envelope. This paper presents the design of a more straightforward and compact version of the traditional Hot-Box apparatus (measures U-value) which instead determines the thermal resistance of samples of building envelope. U-value includes the need to measure/predict the effective <b>surface</b> <b>resistances.</b> In situ <b>surface</b> <b>resistances,</b> which include radiation and convection, are difﬁcult to predict and vary depending on climatic conditions, exposure levels, surface emissivities among many other inﬂuences. The design of the test facility eliminates the need to incorporate these surface behaviour variables. This paper details the replicable apparatus and test methodology. The results of testing a hollow block wall of typical construction using the rig is then presented. The determined R-value is found to be within 1 % of calculated values and the thermal time constant also matches closely with the most accurate predictive estimates...|$|R

50|$|If hull {{speed is}} not a {{limiting}} factor, and if {{the strength of the}} wind is sufficient to overcome the <b>surface</b> <b>resistance,</b> then the speed of the boat as a multiple of the wind speed depends only on how close it can sail to the wind. For example, assuming that <b>surface</b> <b>resistance</b> is negligible (as for an iceboat), if a boat sails at 90° to the true wind, but at 45° to the apparent wind, then it must be sailing at the same speed as the true wind. That is, if the wind speed is V, then the boat's speed is also V. Elementary trigonometry and elementary vector operations can be used to show that, if a boat sails perpendicular to the true wind, but at angle alpha (α) to the apparent wind, and the wind speed is V, then the boat's speed must be V×cotangent(α). The table below shows the values of this function, as a multiple of windspeed. The actual speed of a sailing vessel depends on the wind speed, how close to the wind it is sailing, the resistance of the surface (water or ice), and leeway (downwind drift).|$|E

50|$|If a boat sails {{perpendicular}} to the wind, it will never reach the upwind mark. So, in racing, speed is not everything.

The tables below show velocity made good, again as a multiple of windspeed, and again assuming negligible <b>surface</b> <b>resistance.</b> The first column indicates the course as an angle off the true wind; α is the closest angle to the apparent wind at which the boat can sail.

50|$|To get {{the same}} <b>surface</b> <b>resistance</b> as with carbon steel would require the metal to be thinner than is {{practical}} for a cooking vessel; at 24 kHz a copper vessel bottom {{would need to be}} 1/56th the skin depth of carbon steel. Since the skin depth is inversely proportional to the square root of the frequency, this suggests that much higher frequencies (say, several megahertz) would be required to obtain equivalent heating in a copper pot as in an iron pot at 24 kHz. Such high frequencies are not feasible with inexpensive power semiconductors; in 1973 the silicon-controlled rectifiers used were limited to no more than 40 kHz. Even a thin layer of copper on the bottom of a steel cooking vessel will shield the steel from the magnetic field and make it unusable for an induction top. Some additional heat is created by hysteresis losses in the pot due to its ferromagnetic nature, but this creates less than ten percent of the total heat generated.|$|E
