500|$|Critics' {{concerns}} did {{not stop}} the play from being a box office success. Several reviewers anticipated that focusing on the play's salacious content would increase patronage. Woods exploited {{the controversy over the}} play's content in his advertisements for it. When he was taken to court, The New York Times decided Woods could no longer use the name of the play in any ads placed with the paper. Woods worked around the problem by promoting the large number of people who had seen an unnamed production at his theater, with daily updates of the total. In ads where he could mention the name, he traded on its reputation with suggestive taglines, such as one inviting audiences to [...] "complete your education" [...] by seeing the play. Some ads suggested the reader <b>should</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> play to stay informed, because there was widespread discussion of it. In other ads, it was declared [...] "the most famous play in America".|$|E

[...] He also described the film as [...] "a little ponderous and talky" [...] while praising Canale's transformation scenes and the [...] "masterful filming of cobwebs, creaking doors, and decay, along with great lighting".

Martyn Conterio, in his book on Black Sunday stated that it would be [...] "pushing it to declare I Vampiri as a neglected masterpiece, but it is a hugely underrated work and very cleverly sets out what a horror film with a modern edge and sensibility could achieve." [...] Louis Paul wrote a negative review of the film in his book Italian Horror Film Directors, opining that the film suffered some damaging influences from neorealistic cinema, which turned on very static scenes. He also opined that the film spends too much time with Dario Michaelis character, and the [...] "mind-numbingly dull and endless police procedural scenes" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1896 the {{association}} appointed a [...] "Committee of Seven" [...] {{to develop a}} national standard for college admission requirements {{in the field of}} history. Before this time, individual colleges defined their own entrance requirements. After substantial surveys of prevailing teaching methods, emphases and curricula in secondary schools, the Committee published [...] "The Study of History in Schools" [...] in 1898. Their report largely defined the way history would be taught {{at the high school level}} as a preparation for college, and wrestled with issues about how the field should relate to the other social studies. The Committee recommended four blocks of Western history, to be taught in chronological order—ancient, medieval and modern European, English, and American history and civil government—and advised that teachers [...] "tell a story" [...] and [...] "bring out dramatic aspects" [...] to make history come alive.he student who is taught to consider political subjects in school, who is led to look at matters historically, has some mental equipment for a comprehension of the political and social problems that will confront him in everyday life, and has received practical preparation for social adaptation and for forceful participation in civic activities.... The pupil <b>should</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> growth of the institutions which surround him; he <b>should</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> work of men; he should study the living concrete facts of the past; he should know of nations that have risen and fallen; he should see tyranny, vulgarity, greed, benevolence, patriotism, self-sacrifice, brought out in the lives and works of men.
