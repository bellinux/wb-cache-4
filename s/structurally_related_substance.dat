40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF Panel) deals with the safety assessment of the substance phosphorous acid, mixed 2, 4 -bis(1, 1 -dimethylpropyl) phenyl and 4 -(1, 1 -dimethylpropyl) phenyl triesters. The substance was evaluated by the CEF Panel in 2011 and 2, 4 -di-tert-amylphenol, an impurity and hydrolysis product was re-evaluated by the CEF Panel in 2015. In this application, the applicant requested an increase of the specific migration limit of the substance, currently established at 5 mg/kg food, to 10 mg/kg food, and provided new toxicological studies. Findings from three new in vitro mutagenicity assays on the oxidation products support the conclusion from 2011 that the substance and its oxidation products are not genotoxic. A new toxicokinetic study on the substance supports the consideration from the evaluation in 2011 that the substance does not raise concern for accumulation. The outcome of a new delayed neurotoxicity study on a <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>substance,</b> phosphorous acid, tris (2, 4 -di-tert-butylphenyl) ester, which was considered not to cause neurotoxicity in hens, strengthens {{the conclusion of the}} Panel in 2011 that the substance does not represent a concern for neurotoxicity. From a new two-generation reproduction toxicity study and a prenatal developmental toxicity study on the substance, a new subchronic toxicity study on its oxidation products that completes the one submitted in 2011 on the substance itself, and a 2 -year oral toxicity study on the <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>substance,</b> the lowest NOAEL was 58 - 147 mg/kg bw per day (from the 2 -year oral toxicity study).

The observed inhibitory effect of PFA has been {{compared with that of}} a <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>substance,</b> phosphonoacetate (PAA). Phosphonoformate, at a concentration of IOO #M, reduced the activities of all the above mentioned polymerases by 90 ~o when (rA) n. (dT) 10 was used as a template/primer. The dose-response curves for AMV and RMuLV poly-merases primed with (rA) n. (dT) lo showed PFA to be a lOOO-fold more active than PAA; the RMuEV polymerase activity was reduced to 5 o ~ after incubation with o' 7 /zM-PFA and o. 7 mM-PAA, respectively. There was no difference in PFA inhibition of virus-associated and purified reverse transcriptase activity. Results with various synthetic templates showed that both the RNA- and the DNA-dependent polymerase activities of reverse transcriptase were inhibited by PFA. The endogenous polymerase activity of AMV was inhibited to 5 o ~ at Ioo/tM-PFA, while PAA had no effect. The PFA inhibition was dependent on whether Mg ~+ or Mn ~+ was used as divalent cation in the assay. Phosphonoformate arrested DNA synthesis immediately after being added to the assay system.

In the present paper, a 12 -step procedure for the safety evaluation of NFCs, 'the naturals paradigm', is discussed. This procedure, which {{is not intended to}} be viewed as a rigid check list, begins with a description of the chemical composition of the commercial product, followed by a review of the data on the history of dietary use. Next, each constituent of an NFC is assigned to one of 33 congeneric groups of <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>substances</b> and to one of three classes of toxic potential, each with its own exposure threshold of toxicological concern. The group of substances of unknown structure is placed in the class of greatest toxic potential. In subsequent steps, for each congeneric group the procedure determines the per capita intake, considers metabolic pathways and explores the need and availability of toxicological data. Additional toxicological and analytical data may be required for a comprehensive safety evaluation. The procedure concludes with an evaluation of the NFC in its entirety, also considering combined exposure to congeneric groups. The first experiences with the use of this procedure are very promising. Future safety evaluations of larger numbers of NFCs will indicate the usefulness of the system, either in its present form or in a form modified on the basis of experience. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the suitability of polyacrylic acid (PAA) as a carrier in solid dispersions, with the aim to delay crystallization of basic drugs and improve their dissolution behaviour. The physicochemical properties were investigated in order to link the physical state of some model compounds to their dissolution properties. Loperamide and two <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>substances</b> were selected as model compounds. Solid dispersions were prepared by spray drying. The amount of residual solvents and water was determined with gas chromatography (GCS: S: solvent) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The drug loading of the dispersions was determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). ADSC (alternating or temperature modulated DSC), XRD and FT-IR-spectroscopy were used to evaluate the physical state and in vitro dissolution tests were performed to measure the dissolution properties. IR-measurements demonstrated the formation of a salt between the COOH-groups of the polymer and the amino-groups of the compounds. This phenomenon results in high T(g) -values of the dispersions, suppression of crystallization of the fragment molecules during preparation and an increase of the dissolution rate. Furthermore, the stability study conducted on the dispersions with loperamide showed that both, the amorphous state of the drug and the dissolution behaviour are stable under the applied storage conditions. Hence, from the experimental results it could be concluded that PAA is a suitable carrier in the formulation of stable solid dispersions for the basic compounds that were investigated. status: publishe...|$|R

The method is shown to be able to separate <b>structurally</b> closely <b>related</b> <b>substances,</b> diastereomers and further isobaric compounds, to separate members of different alkaloid classes within one run and to tolerate significant matrix load. A comparison with methods presented in the literature reveals that a near-generic NACE-MS method for the fast profiling of alkaloids in forensically relevant plant samples has been developed...|$|R
40|$|Two auxin-inducible {{glutathione}} S-transferase (GST, EC 2. 5. 1. 18) isozymes from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum, White Burley) were partially characterized. GST 1 - 1 and GST 2 - 1 {{are members}} of a recently identified new type of plant GST isozymes that we will here refer to as type III. Both enzymes were active, with 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene as a substrate, when expressed in bacteria as fusion proteins. The apparent Km for 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene was found to be 0. 85 [plus or minus] 0. 25 mM for GST 1 - 1 and 0. 20 [plus or minus] 0. 15 mM for GST 2 - 1. The apparent Km for glutathione was similar for both enzymes, 0. 40 [plus or minus] 0. 15 mM. The in vitro activity of both enzymes could be inhibited by the synthetic auxin 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, with an apparent Ki of 80 [plus or minus] 40 [mu]M for GST 1 - 1 and 200 [plus or minus] 100 [mu]M for GST 2 - 1. The GST 1 - 1 was also inhibited by <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>substances,</b> such as 2, 4 -dichlorobenzoic acid, with a roughly similar Ki. The nonchlorinated structures benzoic acid and phenoxyacetic acid did not inhibit. p-Chloroisobutyric acid, or clofibric acid, an auxin-transport inhibitor, was found to be an active inhibitor as well. The strongest inhibitor identified, however, was a phenylacetic acid derivative, ethacrynic acid, which showed an apparent Ki of 5 [plus or minus] 5 [mu]M for both enzymes. This substance is a known inducer as well as a substrate of specific mammalian GSTs. The results presented here indicate that the type III plant GSTs might be involved in the metabolism or transport of chlorinated <b>substances</b> that are <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> to auxins. The possibility that auxins are endogenous ligands or substrates for GSTs is discussed...|$|R
30|$|European {{regulatory}} {{frameworks for}} chemicals (i.e. registered under REACH, {{plant protection products}} (PPPs), biocides, human and veterinary medicinal products) require that substances undergo an assessment to identify whether they are persistent (P), bioaccumulative (B) and toxic (T), or very persistent (vP) and very bioaccumulative (vB), i.e. to identify them as PBT substances or vPvB substances according to their properties. We screened current practices, evaluated possibilities and made {{a proposal for a}} harmonised assessment. Our proposal assumes that {{it should be possible to}} identify PBT and vPvB substances on the basis of the data available according to the requirements of the respective legal frameworks. For substances registered as PPPs and mostly also biocides and medicinal products, a ‘definitive assessment’ is often possible. Within REACH, the registrant has to provide all information necessary for PBT assessment regardless of the yearly tonnage of chemicals. But in cases of limited data availability, we suggest using a weight of evidence approach to account for such differences in data availability and type of data across different frameworks and to make use of valuable additional information. We propose to base the evaluation of persistence on degradation half-lives and to normalise a number of parameters (e.g. type of kinetics used, temperature). But further work is needed, e.g. for deriving DegT 50 for water and sediment compartments. For the B-criterion, information other than BCF in fish could be considered and more information related to bioaccumulation processes should be gathered (e.g. in species other than fish, different uptake routes). Testing for T identification is focused on standard aquatic species but could also be complemented by e.g. information from other species. Information such as those read-across from <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>substances</b> and QSAR are often of importance for screening assessments. The aim of PBT and vPvB identification is to reliably target the problematic substances, with as few false negatives or positives as possible, regardless of the regulatory framework. Each aspect was thus considered in the context of the others for a final balanced decision. As the need for conservatism is interpreted differently under the various frameworks, harmonizing this identification is a challenging task.|$|R
40|$|Volatile organic halocarbons (VOX) play an {{important}} role in atmospheric processes. However, biogeochemical release mechanisms from terrestrial environments are complex, not well understood in most parts and a clear view of their relative importance is lacking. Previously, the lithospheric VOX formation potential was subject of only few studies. In the first part of this thesis the development of a new method for the analysis of VOX from rocks and minerals is reported in order to investigate terrigenic VOX formation potential. The purge and trap GC-MS system was optimized for the analyses of halogenated volatile organic compounds having boiling points as low as - 128 °C for carbon tetrafluoride (CF 4). The design of the U-shaped glass lined steel tube (GLT™) cold trap for sample preconcentration and the rapid desorption via resistant heating transferred the desorbed analytes directly onto the GC column via a deactivated capillary column retention gap made sample re-focussing unnecessary. Furthermore, a special air-tight grinding device was developed in which samples ranging from soft halite (hardness 2, Moh’s scale) to hard quartz (hardness 7) are effectively ground to average diameters of 1000 nm or below, thereby releasing gases from fluid inclusions of minerals. The gases are then purged from the grinding chamber with a He carrier gas flow. In the second part of this work, the newly developed method is applied to a set of various mineral and rock samples including fluorite, quartz and halite. The analytical results from GC-MS prove the presence of a wide spectrum of volatile compounds from FIs trapped in various minerals. SF 6 and CF 4 were released from fluorites. Methyl bromide, dichloroethene and dichloroethane were detected in quartz samples from the Archean Yilgarn craton in Australia. Methyl chloride (MeCl) has been detected from almost all samples, including halites, fluorites, quartz and dolerites. Initial heating experiments with halites using purge-and-trap GC-MS as well as pyrolysis-GC-MS demonstrated the important role of temperature in MeCl and VOX formation. Finally, in the last part of this dissertation a case study on one possible formation pathway for the volatile compounds MeCl and dimethylsulfide (DMS), via thermolytic degradation of the amino acid derivative methyl methionine is investigated. A fast response of MeCl and dimethylsulfide emission upon heating of freeze-dried samples at 40 °C was observed and made this a plausible abiotic volatile formation mechanism. Besides the mechanistic studies with methyl methionine and <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>substances,</b> the emission of MeCl and DMS from fluid inclusions, soil samples of terrestrial salt lakes and air sampled immediately above the salt lake surfaces indicated the relevance of this formation pathway for hypersaline environments...|$|R
40|$|Flavomycin is {{a commercially}} {{available}} antimicrobial growth promoter and an authorized additive {{for feeding stuffs}} in the EU and in the USA. As most antibiotically active products biosynthesized by microorganisms, it contains not only a single active compound but is a complex mixture of <b>structurally</b> closely <b>related</b> <b>substances.</b> Multistage matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-ion trap/reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-IT/RTOF-MS) and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-ion trap-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-IT-MS) were utilized for {{a detailed analysis of}} the constituents of the Flavomycin complex based on low-energy collision induced dissociation (CID). An optimal sample preparation for negative ion vacuum MALDI-MS for this compound class was developed. The MALDI-IT/RTOF-MS 2 and -MS 3 analysis starting with the precursor [M - H]- ions of these interesting phosphoglycolipids, named moenomycins, yielded a large variety of product ions that facilitated the structural characterization of this class of compounds. Based on the derived CID fragmentation pathway of the five known major constituents, namely moenomycin A, moenomycin A 12, moenomycin C 4, moenomycin C 3. and moenomycin C 1, four not yet described moenomycin-type constituents could be characterized. They were assigned as 4 F-demethyl- 6 E-O-de-ß-D-glucopyranosyl-moenomycin A, 6 B-N-de(2 -hydroxy- 5 -oxo- 1 -cyclopenten- 1 -yl) -moenomycin A, 6 B-hydroxy- 6 B-de[N-(2 -hydroxy- 5 -oxo- 1 -cyclopenten- 1 -yl) amino]-moenomycin A, and 6 C-hydroxy-moenomycin A. In addition, a moenomycin A carrying an oxygen in the moenocinol-group was found, which is most probably a chemical degradation product. These new compounds were verified by LC-ESI-IT-MS.  2006 American Society for Mass Spectrometry...|$|R
