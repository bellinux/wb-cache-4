5|$|Tyrannosaurs {{had large}} {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves (relative to their brain size). These suggest a highly developed {{sense of smell}} which could <b>sniff</b> <b>out</b> carcasses over great distances, as modern vultures do. Research on the olfactory bulbs of dinosaurs has shown that Tyrannosaurus had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled dinosaurs. Opponents of the pure scavenger hypothesis have used the example of vultures in the opposite way, arguing that the scavenger hypothesis is implausible because the only modern pure scavengers are large gliding birds, which use their keen senses and energy-efficient gliding to cover vast areas economically. Researchers from Glasgow concluded that an ecosystem as productive as the current Serengeti would provide sufficient carrion for a large theropod scavenger, although the theropod might {{have had to be}} cold-blooded in order to get more calories from carrion than it spent on foraging (see Metabolism of dinosaurs). They also suggested that modern ecosystems like the Serengeti have no large terrestrial scavengers because gliding birds now do the job much more efficiently, while large theropods did not face competition for the scavenger ecological niche from gliding birds.|$|E

500|$|After {{moving to}} Los Angeles at age 23, he composed, arranged, and {{performed}} alongside Yanni {{for more than}} six years, performing in-concert with a number of notable symphony orchestras, touring throughout the U.S. and abroad as Yanni gained worldwide fame. [...] His first show was at the Starplex in Dallas with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra filming a video project. [...] "It was a real trial by fire for me", said Joseph. [...] "First show + 10,000 people + TV cameras equals NERVOUS." [...] He told Jane Fredericksen of the St. Croix Valley Press that [...] "It was a big jump, you don't really realize it at the time, but there's no in-between — going from playing nightclubs to arenas." [...] Some of these early tours included the Reflections of Passion, Revolution in Sound, Dare to Dream, Yanni Live, The Symphony Concerts 1993 and 1994 concert tours, as well as a performance in Germany that was broadcast throughout Europe and seen by 30 to 40 million viewers. [...] Joseph appears on the 1994 multi-platinum album and video, Live at the Acropolis. [...] He recounts, [...] "When I reflect back over the years, one of the high points that stand out include performing at the Acropolis with Yanni. [...] Imagine all these different cultures coming together with the challenges of language, equipment, travel, and weather problems. [...] I still picture the police running their dogs through the dressing rooms to <b>sniff</b> <b>out</b> any bomb possibilities right before the show.

2500|$|On 10 April Savige gave Potts {{control of}} the central Bougainville sector. He {{immediately}} sent out patrols to <b>sniff</b> <b>out</b> Japanese.

Winning called Bougainville [...] "a self-supporting POW camp". [...] "To fight a war here and provoke hostilities will {{be nothing more than}} sinful destruction and wastage of bloody fine men who deserve to be laid off and sent home to their people". In Potts' view, taking a brigade trained to the peak of fitness and primed to attack and then giving them a garrison job, was actually more hazardous than sending them into battle. He had already lost one battalion commander in Bougainville, not in combat but in a plane crash while on a reconnaissance flight.|$|E
2500|$|Researchers have {{proposed}} {{that in the past}} a hunting partnership existed between humans and dogs that was the basis for dog domestication. The transition from the Late Pleistocene into the early Holocene was marked by climatic change from cold and dry to warmer, wetter conditions and rapid shifts in flora and fauna, with much of the open habitat of large herbivores being replaced by forests. [...] In the early Holocene, it is proposed that along with changes in arrow-head technology that hunting dogs were used by hunters to track and retrieve wounded game in thick forests. The dog's ability to chase, track, <b>sniff</b> <b>out</b> and hold prey can significantly increase the success of hunters in forests, where human senses and location skills are not as sharp as in more open habitats. Dogs are still used for hunting in forests today.|$|E

Bertha saw the wolf {{and saw that it was}} {{stealing}} towards her, and she began to wish that she had never been allowed to come into the park. She ran as hard as she could, and the wolf came after her with huge leaps and bounds. She managed to reach a shrubbery of myrtle bushes and she hid herself in one of the thickest of the bushes. The wolf came sniffing among the branches, its black tongue lolling out of its mouth and its pale grey eyes glaring with rage. Bertha was terribly frightened, and thought to herself: ‘If I had not been so extraordinarily good I should have been safe in the town at this moment.’ However, the scent of the myrtle was so strong that the wolf could not <b>sniff</b> <b>out</b> where Bertha was hiding, and the bushes were so thick that he might have hunted about in them for a long time without catching sight of her, so he thought he might as well go off and catch a little pig instead. Bertha was trembling very much at having the wolf prowling and sniffing so near her, and as she trembled the medal for obedience clinked against the medals for good conduct and punctuality. The wolf was just moving away when he heard the sound of the medals clinking and stopped to listen; they clinked again in a bush quite near him. He dashed into the bush, his pale grey eyes gleaming with ferocity and triumph, and dragged Bertha out and devoured her to the last morsel. All that was left of her were her shoes, bits of clothing, and the three medals for goodness.” ...|$|E
