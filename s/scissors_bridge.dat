25|$|Sarvatra Bridge layer: {{the bridge}} can be {{deployed}} over water and land obstacles to provide 75 metres of bridge-length for battle tanks, supply convoys and troops. The system {{consists of a}} light aluminum alloy <b>scissors</b> <b>bridge</b> and was approved for production in March 2000 trials. One complete set of the multi span mobile bridging system includes five truck-mounted units with a bridge-span of 15 metres each. The system is designed to take {{the weight of the}} Arjun MBT, by far the heaviest vehicle in the Army's inventory. Microprocessor based control system reduces the number of personnel required to deploy and operationalise the bridge. The bridging equipment is carried on a Tatra Kolos chassis and the system is built by Bharat Earth Movers Ltd (BEML).|$|E
2500|$|... 43rd Division {{was next}} tasked with {{capturing}} Xanten. Again, {{the town was}} protected by an anti-tank ditch. Lieutenant-Colonel Henniker had 553 Fd Co build a 70-foot (20m) Bailey on skids improvised by 207 Fd Pk Co. This was towed [...] down the road by two AVREs of 81st Assault Squadron, RE, from 79th Armoured Division, accompanied by an AVRE with a 'Jumbo' <b>scissors</b> <b>bridge,</b> two more AVREs with fascines, two armoured bulldozers and 20 three-ton lorries loaded with rubble. The intention was to launch the Bailey bridge over the gap where the road crossed the ditch, while the AVREs and a platoon of 260th Fd Co would make a second crossing. If the Bailey was unsuccessful the bulldozers would fill the crater with rubble. Half an hour before first light on 8 March, the engineer column advanced up the road behind the barrage with the assaulting infantry, supported by Churchill Crocodiles. It emerged that {{the gap in the}} road was in fact two craters, too long for the Bailey on skids, and the fascines failed to provide a passable crossing for tracked vehicles, despite the efforts of 260th Fd Co. However, the AVRE bridgelayer was successful in bridging the ditch some 50 yards (45m) from the crater, and the Crocodiles, tanks and infantry passed over. The redundant Bailey section on the road was pulled back with difficulty before 260 Fd Co's lorries could begin delivering rubble. Under heavy fire they constructed a crossing for wheeled vehicles by midday on 9 March. Xanten fell {{by the end of the}} day and by 10.40 on 11 March, no Germans remained west of the Rhine and they blew their last bridges over the river.|$|E
50|$|M60AVLB: {{baseline}} M60-based chassis armored vehicle-launched {{bridge with}} 60 ft <b>scissors</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
50|$|Amphibious {{tanks are}} {{specially}} designed or adapted for water operations, {{but they are}} rare in modern armies, being replaced by purpose-built amphibious assault vehicles or armoured personnel carriers in amphibious assaults. Advances such as the EFA mobile bridge and armoured vehicle-launched <b>scissors</b> <b>bridges</b> have also reduced the impediment to tank advance that rivers posed in World War II.|$|R
25|$|On 8 September, 144 RAC {{supported}} 153 Brigade in {{the assault}} on the German-held French port of Le Havre (Operation Astonia). This involved clearing minefields and crossing an anti-tank ditch. For this operation, 144 RAC had under command the Sherman Crab flail tanks of C Squadron, 1st Lothians and Border Horse and tanks to lay <b>scissors</b> <b>bridges.</b> This operation was successful.|$|R
5000|$|Kartik AVLB [...] - [...] Armoured vehicle-launched bridge. The same {{elongated}} hull {{used for}} the Catapult was also used to create the Kartik bridge launching vehicle. The Kartik uses a <b>scissors</b> style <b>bridge</b> of Eastern European design, and was first introduced in 1989.|$|R
50|$|M60A1 AVLB - Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge, 60 ft <b>scissors</b> <b>bridge</b> on M60A1 chassis.|$|E
5000|$|MT-55 or MTU-55 (Tankoviy Mostoukladchik) - Soviet {{designator}} for Czechoslovakian MT-55A bridge-layer {{tank with}} <b>scissors</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
5000|$|MT-34 (1950s) (MT {{stands for}} mostní tank tank") - This unit was a Czechoslovakian {{conversion}} with a PM-34 <b>scissors</b> <b>bridge</b> carried on rollers {{on top of}} a turretless T-34.|$|E
50|$|Between {{the wars}} various {{experimental}} bridging tanks {{were used to}} test a series of methods for bridging obstacles and developed by the Experimental Bridging Establishment (EBE).Captain SG Galpin RE conceived a prototype Light Tank Mk V to test the <b>Scissors</b> Assault <b>Bridge.</b> This concept was realised by Captain SA Stewart RE with significant input from a Mr DM Delany, a scientific civil servant in the employ of the EBE.|$|R
5000|$|The Kartik AVLB uses a <b>scissors</b> style <b>bridge</b> of Eastern European design such as Polish/East German BLG-60. The {{bridge is}} folded for {{carriage}} and scissored out for usage and is deployed and {{recovered from the}} front of the vehicle. The 20 metres (66 ft) long 'KARTIK' 60 Military Load Class (MLC) bridge is 4 m wide thus one of the widest tank bridges in the world.The bridge can accommodate two-lanes traffic of jeeps and one lane traffic of 3 tonners, t-72s and BMPs. It is compact for transportation and fits in a space of 10.5 m length, 3.5 m width and 3.96 m height. To keep it light, RDE-40 Al alloy along with innovative geometry have been used [...] The use of high pressure hydraulic drives and actuators instead of electro-chemical drives give advantage of reduced weight. The high pressure hydraulic system gives the muscle power to lift the bridge in the folded climbing gradients or descending slopes.|$|R
5000|$|Bridge Tank 68 - bridge-laying variant, with single-piece span {{instead of}} more common <b>scissors</b> <b>bridge,</b> capable of {{spanning}} 18.2 m gap; 30 produced between 1974 and 1977 and used until 2011 ...|$|E
5000|$|The Vickers Armoured Bridgelayer or Vickers AVLB is {{also based}} on the Mk 3 and is {{equipped}} with a hydraulically operated launch and recovery system for an MLC 60/70 <b>scissors</b> <b>bridge</b> with a length of 13.41 m.|$|E
50|$|An {{armoured}} bridgelaying vehicle; a turretless Mk II {{fitted with}} 34 ft long by 9 ft wide Class 30 (capable of bearing 30 LT) <b>scissors</b> <b>bridge.</b> Several dozen were produced, {{some of them}} supplied to the USSR. Used in action in Italy, Burma and North-west Europe.|$|E
50|$|The chassis of this variant {{is almost}} {{identical}} to the AMX-30. Instead of the turret, a <b>scissors</b> <b>bridge</b> is laid hydraulically over {{the rear of the}} vehicle. Deployment and retraction time of the bridge is about 5 minutes, and has a span of 20 meters. The bridge is erected vertically, and can therefore be easily seen by enemy forces.|$|E
50|$|The Sarvatra is a 75 {{meters long}} {{multi-span}} mobile bridging system consists of five <b>scissors</b> <b>bridge</b> made of aluminum alloy having span of 15 meters each mounted on separate mobile platform. Each mobile platform is a modified Tatra 815 VVN 8 x 8 chassis drive-able from both ends by having an additional small cabin with required driving controls. Further a microprocessor based control system is utillised to deploy and operationalise {{the entire system}} {{in less than two}} and half hours.|$|E
50|$|When the 15 meter long <b>scissors</b> <b>bridge</b> {{is opened}} out it is fitted with {{adjustable}} trestles to enable {{a number of}} units {{to be used to}} bridge wet and dry gaps. All five sections are laid to provide a total bridge length of 75 m providing a roadway of four meters. The bridge is launched/recovered from either end. With the help of telescopic legs, the height of the bridge is adjusted from 2.5 m to 6 m so that it is not easily visible from far.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} series-produced examples is the Brückenleger IV, a German AVLB based on the Panzer IV, which entered service with the Wehrmacht in 1940. Twenty were built, but problems of excessive weight limited the vehicle's effectiveness, and eventually all 20 were converted back to tanks. A new <b>scissors</b> <b>bridge</b> design was brought out by the British {{in response to the}} war, sufficient to support a 24-ton load over 30 ft. This was developed for the Covenanter tank. Eventually, it developed into a 30-ton capacity and therefore was carried by a turretless Valentine tank. It was used in Italy, North West Europe and Burma.|$|E
50|$|The bridge {{consists}} of two track carriers of aluminum alloy. Each track support {{consists of}} two end portions and two intermediate portions. It is not a <b>scissors</b> <b>bridge,</b> it is transported in its entire length. The storage beam is mounted between the two tracking beams, which is connected to a hydraulic ram. The laying of the bridge is {{carried out by the}} hydraulically operated bar with which the whole bridge is moved over the guide frame (support bar). For laying, the storage beam is first extended and placed with the tip on the ground (thus, no support shield is necessary). Then the bridge is moved along the storage beam. After laying down the bridge, the storage beam is detached and is retracted.|$|E
