2500|$|After this point, {{the panels}} {{deal with the}} {{response}} of the gods. The north central panel represents the continuation of the ritual in the afterlife, and shows how the events of the game connect the society of El Tajin to the gods. At the center of the scene is a temple with the rain and wind gods seated on top and a vat of liquid within. The sacrificed player appears here, whole and with a pot under his arm. He points to the vat and addresses the rain god. The liquid is protected by a reclining chacmool, who is speaking. [...] What is being requested is pulque, indicated by a glyph indicating the mythical origin of the drink and a <b>split</b> <b>image</b> of the god of pulque above the scene. On the south central panel is depicting a scene after the sacrificed ball player has received the pulque with the same temple, glyphs and depiction of the pulque god. The differences are a depiction of the moon as a rabbit, the rain god in front of the temple and the level of the liquid in the vat lowered. The rain god is shown in a rite of auto sacrifice running a spike through part of his penis. The blood falls into the vat and to refill it with pulque.|$|E
40|$|There are {{situations}} {{where it is}} not possible to capture a large document with a given imaging media such as Scanner and Xerox machine in a single stretch because of their inherent limitations. This result in capturing a large document in terms of split components of an image. Hence, the need is to mosaic the split components into a large document image. In this paper, we present a new and simple approach to mosaic the two <b>split</b> <b>images</b> of a large document based on matching sum of values of pixels of window in the <b>split</b> <b>images.</b> The method compares the sum of values of pixels of window in <b>split</b> <b>images</b> to identify Overlapping Region (OLR) in the <b>split</b> <b>images.</b> The OLR, a region in common, helps in mosaicing of two <b>split</b> <b>images</b> of large document. However, a small OLR is assumed to be available at the end of <b>split</b> <b>images</b> of a large document. In addition to this, the OLR in the <b>split</b> <b>images</b> depends on the size of the window. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is satisfactorily.

This paper presents a novel approach to mosaic multiple <b>split</b> <b>images</b> without human intervention, based on control points.

40|$|According to {{the hybrid}} theory of object {{recognition}} (Hummel, 2001), ignored object images are represented holistically, and attended images both holistically and analytically. This account correctly predicts patterns of visual priming {{as a function}} of translation, scale (Stankiewicz & Hummel, 2000) and left-right reflection (Stankiewicz, Hummel & Cooper, 1998). The model also predicts that priming for attended images will generalize over configural distortions (<b>split</b> <b>images)</b> whereas priming for ignored images will not. Three experiments tested and confirmed this prediction. <b>Split</b> <b>images</b> visually primed their intact and split counterparts when they were attended but not when they were ignored, whereas intact images primed themselves whether they were attended or not. The data contribute to the growing body of evidence that one function of visual attention is to permit the generation of explicitly relational representations of object shape...|$|R
