The effect of strain rate during different portions of the loading cycle on fatigue life of carbon and low-alloy steels in 289 {degree}C water was determined. Crack growth studies on wrought and cast SSs have been completed. The effect of dissolved-oxygen concentration in high-purity water on IASCC of irradiated Type 304 SS was investigated and trace elements in the steel that increase susceptibility to intergranular cracking were identified. Preliminary results were obtained on crack growth rates of high-nickel alloys in water that contains {{a wide range of}} dissolved oxygen and hydrogen concentrations at 289 and 320 {degree}C. The program on Environmentally Assisted Cracking of Light Water Reactor Materials is currently focused on four tasks: fatigue initiation in pressure vessel and piping steels, fatigue and environmentally assisted crack growth in cast duplex and austenitic SS, irradiation-assisted stress corrosion cracking of austenitic SSs, and environmentally assisted crack growth in high-nickel alloys. Measurements of corrosion-fatigue crack growth rates (CGRs) of wrought and cast stainless steels has been essentially completed.

40|$|Fibrillin- 1 is {{the main}} {{component}} of the 10 - 12 nm microfibrils, which are found in several elastic and non-elastic tissues. Human fibrillin- 1 contains multiple calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like (cbEGF) domains interspersed with transforming growth factor β-binding protein-like (TB) domains. TB 4 domain contains a flexible RGD loop which mediates cell adhesion via αVβ 3, α 5 β 1 and αVβ 6 integrins. Mutations which introduce amino acid substitutions into TB 4 are associated with a wide spectrum of diseases such as Marfan syndrome (MFS), ectopia lentis, Stiff skin syndrome (SSS). Amino acid substitutions such as W 1570 C, C 1564 S and C 1577 G in the TB 4 domain have been found to cause SSS. The upstream TB 5 domain has been predicted to modulate integrin binding and a deletion in the domain has been found in Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS), phenotype of which is similar to SSS (skin fibrosis and short stature), thereby suggesting that the underlying pathogenic mechanism might be similar. This study has used cellular, biochemical and biophysical methods to investigate the effects of <b>SSS</b> substitutions <b>C</b> 1564 S and W 1570 C on domain structure and function and compared it to a MFS substitution C 1564 Y in the TB 4 domain and WMS deletion in the TB 5 domain. Effects of the SSS mutations on structure of the domains were studied using limited proteolysis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and calcium chelation experiments. Subsequently, the ability of human fibroblasts to secrete wild-type and mutant fibrillin- 1 was examined to identify the effect of the mutations on the trafficking of the protein. Finally, cell binding assays and SPR was employed to investigate the effect of disease-causing mutations on fibrillin- 1 /integrin interactions. The results demonstrate that the SSS mutations affect TB 4 -cbEGF 23 interface and calcium-binding to cbEGF 23 but do not alter secretion of recombinant fibrillin- 1 mutant fragments from the cell. On the other hand, intracellular retention was observed for MFS substitution C 1564 Y which was shown to be more susceptible to proteolysis than <b>SSS</b> substitution <b>C</b> 1564 S. WMS deletion also gives rise to partial retention of the recombinant fragment, suggesting a different pathogenic mechanism for these disorders. Cell binding assays and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments show that SSS mutations affect binding to αvβ 3 integrin, but not αvβ 6 integrin suggesting that selectively impaired integrin interactions may contribute to pathogenesis of SSS.
