40|$|AbstractTo {{identify}} the key characteristics of cationic polyacrylamide (c-PAM) for evaluating sewage sludge dewatering performance, {{we examined the}} properties of 13 types of c-PAMs that come from different manufacturers via a laboratory assay. The sludge dewatering performance was determined through a full-scale test at a large wastewater treatment plant in Beijing. We checked the cationic degree, solution viscosity, dissolution time, and 1 mm <b>sieve</b> <b>residue</b> of c-PAM. The 1 mm <b>sieve</b> <b>residue</b> was found to affect the dissolution time, solution viscosity, and conductivity. The full-scale test indicated that the cationic degree {{is the most important}} factor that affects the dosage and treatment capacity of the belt filter press when the cationic degree ranges from 25 % to 45 %. However, the moisture content of sludge cake is mainly relevant to raw sludge organic content. The sludge dewatering performance of the 13 types of c-PAMs showed that the c-PAM should be selected based on cationic degree, solution viscosity, and 1 mm <b>sieve</b> <b>residue.</b> The dosage should then be adjusted at the appropriate time according to the status of the equipment and facilities during sludge dewatering...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} micro-{{grinding}} medium on grinding performance of Portland cement, with determining specific surface area, 45 um and 80 um <b>sieve</b> <b>residue,</b> density, {{particle size distribution}}, chemical shrinkage and strength were studied. In this article, the RRBS of grinding of cement particle size distribution data was observed to be very well. When the content of micro-grinding medium is less than 10 %, the specific surface area is increased as {{the ratio of the}} grinding medium increased. At the same time, the flexural and compressive strength of cement increased as the content increases. The density of cement decreased quite significantly with the content of micro-grinding medium increased. The 80 um <b>sieve</b> <b>residue</b> of the cement increases obviously, when the content of micro-grinding medium is more than 10 %...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Organic {{substances}} containing {{hydroxyl group}} and alcohol amine group were chosen {{in this paper}} {{and the effects of}} different organic group on powder properties and physical performance of cement pastes were studied using various methods of analysis, such as particle size analysis, fluidness analysis and XRD. The results show that monohydric alcohols have a neglectable aid-grinding effect. For Polyhydric alcohols and ethanol amine, the absorption capacity of the hydroxyl group or amido {{on the surface of the}} powder may increase in relation to the increase in groups, which can increase fineness but cannot improve the fluidity. For Diethanolamine and Triethanolamine, the absorption on the powder mainly depends on the hydroxyl group, but the amido has a strong electrostatic repulsive force, so the dispersion of the powder not only comes from high steric hindrance effect, but also the electrostatic repulsive force, which can improve the powder’s dispersity, reduce <b>sieve</b> <b>residue</b> and increase the fluidity. This research paper provides a theoretical guide for the application of grinding aids...|$|E
40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{method was}} developed to count and observe antagonists of soil nematodes and simulate their relationships in the soil. A 10 - to 25 -cc soil sample is suspended in water and washed {{through a series of}} small standard <b>sieves.</b> <b>Residues</b> are washed into a small beaker and collected on a 24 -mm filter paper disk in a filter holder under vacuum. The disk is placed on corn meal agar in a petri dish. Microfauna and flora present in the sample colonize the organic matter on the disk and move onto and into the agar where they can be observed easily. Distinct successions of organisms usually occur and within 6 - 18 days or more, parasites and predators of nematodes are often abundant, especially nematode-trapping fungi. Counting predation events and parasitized nematodes in replicate dishes after specific incubation periods allows quantitative comparisons between soil samples. The method has distinct advantages over others for enumerating organisms which attack nematodes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper aims {{to study}} the co-processing of POPs (DDTs and HCHs) {{contaminated}} soil as an alternative raw material for sustainable clinker production. The milling system designed solely to contaminated soil was introduced with hot air (250 - 350 °C) to dry water and simultaneously vaporize POPs. The gaseous POPs was directly destroyed in the precalciner, while the milled soil with partly removal of organic pollutants was homogenized in a sealed silo and then took part in clinker sintering. According to the experiment results the moisture content reached an average of 0. 4 %, and the average 200 μm and 80 μm <b>sieve</b> <b>residues</b> were 1. 9 % and 19. 0 % respectively after grinding. Furthermore, clinkers and emission which were produced with contaminated soil as SiO 2 substitute were monitored. There was no DDTs and HCHs residue both in clinkers and in exhaust, which demonstrated the success of eliminating organic pollutants and utilizing the soil as alternative SiO 2 materials in our cement plant...|$|R
40|$|Stable isotope {{analysis}} of ostracod shells is used routinely for palaeoenvironmental studies of ostracod-bearing records. Sample treatment usually involves the disaggregation of sediments and sieving; before the <b>sieving</b> <b>residues</b> were washed with water onto petri dishes and oven-dried. In our study, we compared δ 18 O and δ 13 C values of shells that were oven-dried from water and from ethanol alternatively. Large isotopic differences {{of up to}} 3 ‰ were determined for δ 18 O values, whereas differences in δ 13 C values were less pronounced with differences of up to 1. 6 ‰. Stable isotope values of shells dried from water were lower for both oxygen and carbon {{as a result of}} calcite crystals precipitated on the shell surfaces during the drying process. Therefore, ostracod shells for stable isotope analysis should not be prepared by drying from water. Instead, shells should be dried from ethanol to obtain reliable stable isotope data; likewise freeze-drying is expected to provide trustworthy results...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of sieving with different mesh sizes on the efficiency of processing fossil chironomids from lake sediments for isotope analyses. Results obtained for three different sediments indicate that each of the studied sieve fractions (100 – 150, 150 – 200, 200 – 250, 250 – 300, > 300 ?m) contain a similar proportion of the overall mass of chironomid fossils in a sample. However, the sorting time needed to separate chironomids from other <b>sieve</b> <b>residue</b> is disproportionately large for smaller mesh sizes. Employing sieves with a 200 -?m rather than the 100 -?m mesh commonly used for standard palaeoecological analyses of fossil chironomids decreased processing time for a given mass of fossils by 30 – 58 % in our study. For optimizing the efficiency of chironomid sample processing for stable isotope and radiocarbon analysis we therefore recommend a 200 -?m mesh size sieve, although the sorting of all > 100 -?m fractions may be necessary in sediments with low chironomid abundances. Excluding certain small taxa from isotope analysis, may structurally bias isotope values of samples. Therefore, further studies on taxon-specific isotope analysis are required to quantify these effects...|$|E
40|$|In 2014 a benthic infauna {{survey was}} carried out in Swansea Bay (Wales, UK), an {{industrial}}ised embayment with a long history of shipping, industrial and domestic pollution, fishing, dredging and spoil disposal. The purpose of the survey was to generate up-to-date baseline information about the benthic communities in the area, and also to compare the current situation with a similar survey carried out 30 years ago. In 2014 grab samples were retrieved at 101 positions in the wider Swansea Bay area to analyse the infauna benthos as well as sediment grain size distribution. Grab samples were taken with a 0. 1 m 2 Day grab. About 200 g of surface sediment were removed for particle size analysis, and the remaining sediment was washed through a sieve with 1 mm mesh. The <b>sieve</b> <b>residue</b> was fixed in 4 % formaldehyde and stained with Rose Bengal. All benthic fauna was sorted from the samples, identified to species level if possible, and counted. Sediment samples were air dried and passed through a series of sieves from 2 mm to 63 µm according to the Wentworth-Udden classification scale to determine particle-size distribution. The survey revealed spatially discrete benthic communities including a biodiversity hotspot. Habitat characteristics including sediment properties and the proximity to a sewage outfall explained 17 - 35 % of the variation in the community structure. A group of five common species was found to be particularly persistent over time (Nucula nitidosa, Spisula elliptica, Spiophanes bombyx, Nephtys hombergii, Diastylis rathkei). According to the Infauna Quality Index (IQI) linked to the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) the average ecological status for 2014 was 'moderate', but eleven samples showing 'poor' and 'bad' status indicated possible negative impacts of dredge spoil disposal. Here the 2014 set of data is made publically available. The comparison of the 2014 data with the 30 -year old data was published at [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Bu çalışma porselen karo komposizyonunda ince boyutlu mikrogranit hammaddesi kullanımının etkilerini araştırmak amacıyla yapılmıştır. Porselen karolar düşük su emmeli, yüksek mekanik mukavemet gösteren, az leke tutan, sırlı ve sırsız olarak iç ve dış mekanlarda kullanılan ürünlerdir. İstenen bu özelliklerin sağlanabilmesi için son zamanlarda ekonomik nedenlerden dolayı geleneksel hammaddelerin yanında alternatif hammadde kaynakların kullanılması da gündemdedir. Bu çalışmada ilk olarak mikrogranit malzemesi farklı tane boyutlarına getirilerek inceltilmiş ve bu malzemenin fiziksel ve termal özellikleri incelenmiştir. Daha sonra {{standart}} bir komposizyonda ergitici olarak kullanılan sodyum feldspat yerine reçeteye ince mikrogranit malzemesi % 8 ile % 20 arasında değişen oranlarda katılmıştır. Farklı oranlardaki bu katkıların son ürüne olan etkisini görmek amacıyla elde edilen nihai ürünlere su emme, pişme küçülmesi, mukavemet ve renk “L a b” testleri uygulanmıştır. Ayrıca, mikroyapıyı incelemek amacıyla da XRD ve SEM çalışmaları yapılmıştır. Gerçekleştirilen çalışmalar sonucunda ince mikrogranit malzemesinin komposizyona ilavesinin camsı fazın viskozitesini düşürdüğü, sinterleme sıcaklığı ve maksimum sıcaklıkta bekleme süresini azalttığı belirlenmiştir. In this study, microgranite {{samples were}} collected from a large ceramic production region in Karakoy located in the Southeast part of Bilecik province inTurkey (NW Turkey). Due to its high alkaline (Na 2 O+ K 2 O ~ 8. 0 - 8. 5) and low Fe 2 O 3, TiO 2 content, {{it is likely to}} consider microgranite as a fluxing agent for porcelain tile bodies. In {{the first part of the}} experimental study, both as-received and 270 min. attrition milled microgranite samples were added into the glazed porcelain body in the following proportions 8 %, 12 %, 16 %, 20 % meanwhile albite was removed from the Standard body formulation. Following the wet ball milling of standard body and studied porcelain bodies, some test samples were prepared according to Standard test procedure. The prepared samples were then taken to fast firing process in roller kilns under industrial conditions of 1200 °C and 49 min. Prior to firing process slip properties of density (g/l), flow rate (s) and <b>sieve</b> <b>residue</b> (+ 63 p) were measured. Following this, the properties of fired body samples such as bulk density, shrinkage (%), water absorption (%), dry and fired strength and colour measurements expressed as L, a and b were measured as well. When compared with Standard body, the results showed that the increase in microgranite amount decreased the water absorption and increased shrinkage and fired strength. Non-contact dilatometric analysis and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were performed to determine the thermal expansion behaviours of the bodies, thermal behaviours of the bodies and the phases, respectively. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was further employed to observe the microstructure of the fired microgranite samples with respect to firing temperature. Moreover after firing process under industrial conditions quartz, plagioclase and mullite phases were detected in the bodies as the main phases. Based on these analyses and observations made during this study, it has been concluded that very fine grained microgranite material can be used in glazed porcelain tile bodies as a very good fluxing agent which leads to the suggestion that the removal of albite taken from £ine-Aydm region from the body recipe can be taken into consideration...|$|E

The tested peak firing temperatures were varied at 20 ºC intervals from 1140 to 1180 ºC for floor tile bodies. The physical and thermal properties of the fired bodies such as colour, water absorption, linear firing shrinkage, and bulk density were measured. Furthermore, consideration was given to the phase and microstructural evolution of the developed tile bodies. X-ray fluorescence, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) in combination with thermogravimetry were used to analyse the phases formed before and after firing.

40|$|Azolla primaeva (Penhallow) Arnold fertile whole {{plants from}} the lower Eocene of Driftwood Creek, Canada have been {{examined}} using LM, SEM, TEM and SRXTM methods on hand specimens and <b>sieved</b> <b>residues.</b> The new data have resulted in an emended diagnosis. The megaspore is partly covered by filosum and the wall lacks excrescences. The exoperine is highly variable with nodular, to clavate, baculate and tabulate elements, which fuse to form a foveolate to reticulate megaspore surface, which is complex and contorted. Glochidia on the microspore massulae are sometimes septate and the flukes on their anchor-shaped tips are variable, some being long, narrow and wavy, others shorter and broad and a few are recurved. Hairs are lacking on the massula surface and glochidia. The organization of the float zone of the megaspore apparatus has always been controversial with 0, 1, 3 or 9 floats proposed. The new results show {{that there are no}} pseudovacuolate floats. By contrast, the ‘float’ zone consists of bundles of modified granular and filamentous endoperine elements surrounded by bundles of broader suprafilosum hairs. The absence of pseudovacuolate floats in A. primaeva is suggested to be an important character for phylogenetic analyses. The high variability in glochidia tips, glochidia septa and exoperine organisation is unusual within the genus Azolla. The new data on A. primaeva are compared with the other two whole plant Azolla species from Canada (Azolla stanleyi and Azolla schopfii) and with dispersed Azolla reproductive structures from Canada including the Arctic. This confirms that all are distinct species...|$|R
40|$|Crustacea (dynomenid {{crabs and}} cirripedes) {{from the upper}} Cenomanian-lower Turonian nearshore, shallow-water bioclastic limestones to marly siltstones found along the {{southern}} and eastern margins of the Bohemian Cretaceous Basin (BCB) are described. Crabs are rather rare in this area, and mostly restricted to fragmentary pereiopods, i. e., isolated claws or dactyli. In view of the confused taxonomy of isolated claws, their proper identity could not be determined; they were mostly referred to the necrocarcinid genus Necrocarcinus Bell, 1863. A recent re-examination of material deposited in the collections of the National Museum (Národní Muzeum, Prague), and of new finds, has revealed that all allegedly necrocarcinid pereiopods and nearly all carapaces from these shallow-water strata actually belong to the dynomenid Graptocarcinus Roemer, 1887 (carapaces) and the ‘form genus’ Roemerus Bishop, 1983 (isolated claws). Here we present a summary report of occurrence of these dynomenid genera in the BCB. Cirripedes are more abundant, yet all available material {{is in the form}} of disarticulated, isolated capitular plates, which is typical for almost all Mesozoic thoracicans. More than 400 capitular plates of stalked barnacles have been discovered in <b>sieve</b> <b>residues</b> during the last decade.

The sieving stage removes crystalline residue, making it easier to extract fossils, but introduces a filter: the smallest fossils (<~40 µm) pass through the sieve and are lost.

40|$|A small lot of latest Cretaceous brittlestars {{from the}} Maastrichtian type area, {{contained}} in the Binkhorst [van den Binkhorst] Collection at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, is restudied and, in part, illustrated for the first time. Presumably, these thirteen specimens represent {{only a portion of}} the ophiuroid material referred to in two papers by Binkhorst van den Binkhorst, both published in 1859, because all are assignable to two species which are common only in the Nekum and Meerssen members of the type Maastrichtian, namely Felderophiura vanderhami Jagt, 1991, and Ophiomusium lux Jagt & Kutscher in Jagt, 2000. Brittlestar material from lower levels within the Maastricht Formation (i. e., Valkenburg, Gronsveld, Schiepersberg and Emael members) referred to by Binkhorst has not been traced. Alternatively, Binkhorst’s original records could have been based on specimens contained in collections of his contemporaries, such as Joseph de Bosquet and Casimir Ubaghs. In most, if not all, of such cases, representatives of Ophiomusium gr. granulosum (Roemer, 1841) [sensu Jagt, 2000] are involved. Based on our own observations in the Maastricht area, Binkhorst’s specimens of F. vanderhami and O. lux must have originated from the upper Meerssen Member where these two species are locally common. In fact, mostly isolated discs are preserved in the present lot, with only some retaining proximal arm portions, which suggests these were picked from <b>sieving</b> <b>residues</b> after bulk sample processing. More or less complete specimens of both species have also been collected recently, but these are confined to bedding planes. Although preservation is mediocre, diagnostic features of both F. vanderhami and O. lux are readily apparent...|$|R

Differences in the isotopic composition of fatty acids allow differentiation of non-ruminant and ruminant fats, as well as adipose and dairy fats. This paper investigates the trends in milk use in areas where sheep and goats are dominant in the faunal assemblage and in some sites from the Linearbandkeramik culture. Sites include: Colle Santo Stefano, Abruzzo, Italy, and the Oldest to Young Linearbandkeramik sites of Zwenkau, Eythra and Brodau, Saxony, and Wang and Niederhummel, Bavaria, Germany.

The new methodology was tested on three large study lakes located next to known and/or excavated pre-Columbian archaeological sites in South and Central America. Five paired samples, one treated by sieving, the other prepared using standard methodology, were compared {{for each of the three}} sites. Using the new methodology, chemically digested sediment samples were passed through a 53 µm <b>sieve,</b> and the <b>residue</b> was retained, mounted in silicone oil, and counted for large cultigen pollen grains. The filtrate was mounted and analysed for pollen according to standard palynological procedures. Zea mays (L.) was recovered from the sediments of all three study lakes using the sieving technique, where no cultigen pollen had been previously recorded using the standard methodology. Confidence intervals demonstrate there is no significant difference in pollen assemblages between the sieved versus unsieved samples. Equal numbers of exotic Lycopodium spores added to both the filtrate and <b>residue</b> of the <b>sieved</b> samples allow for direct comparison of cultigen pollen abundance with the standard terrestrial pollen count. Our technique enables the isolation and rapid scanning for maize and other cultigen pollen in lake sediments, which, in conjunction with charcoal and pollen records, is key to determining land-use patterns and the environmental impact of pre-Columbian societies...|$|R
40|$|Annual horticultural systems rely on {{frequent}} and intensive tillage to prepare beds, manage weeds and control insects. But this practice reduces soil organic carbon (SOC) through accelerated CO 2 emission. Crop residue incorporation could counteract this loss. We investigated whether vegetable systems {{could be made}} more resilient by including a high-residue grain crop such as sweet corn (Zea mays L. var. rugosa), in the rotation {{through the use of}} conventional (no <b>residue,</b> no soil <b>sieving)</b> and organic (<b>residue</b> incorporated and soil sieved) soil management scenarios. We evaluated short-term emission of CO 2 -C and soil C content in incubated Chromosol and Vertosol soils (Australian Classification) with and without sieving (simulated tillage) or the incorporation of ground sweet corn residue. Residue treatment emitted 2. 3 times more CO 2 -C compared to the no-residue treatment, and furthermore, sieved soil emitted 1. 5 times more CO 2 -C than the unsieved across the two soil types. The residue incorporation had a greater effect on CO 2 -C flux than simulated tillage, suggesting that C availability and form can be more important than physical disturbance in cropping soils. The organic scenario (with <b>residue</b> and <b>sieved)</b> emitted more CO 2 -C, but had 13 % more SOC compared with the conventional scenario (without residue and unsieved), indicating that organic systems may retain more SOC than a conventional system. The SOC lost by soil disturbance was more than offset by the incorporation of residue in the laboratory conditions. Therefore, the possible SOC loss by tillage for weed control under organic management may be offset by organic residue input...|$|R

During R. R. S. Charles Darwin Cruises 145 and 146 (12 March to May 28 2003), 11 multicores were taken on the continental margin off Karachi, Pakistan. Two transects were sampled, constituting a composite bathymetric profile from 136 m (above the OMZ in spring 2003) down to 1870 m water depth. Cores (surface area 25. 5 cm 2) were processed as follows: for stations situated above, and in the upper part of the OMZ, sediment slices were taken for the 0 - 0. 5 and 0. 5 - 1 cm intervals, and then in 1 cm intervals down to 10 cm. For the lower part of the OMZ, the second centimetre was also sliced in half-centimetre intervals. Each sample was stored in 10 % borax-buffered formalin for further processing. Onshore, the samples were wet sieved over 63 µm, 150 µm and 300 µm <b>sieves</b> and the <b>residues</b> were stained for one week in ethanol with Rose Bengal. After staining, the residue was washed again. The stained faunas were picked wet in three granulometric fractions (63 - 150 µm, 150 - 300 µm and > 300 µm), down to 10 cm depth. To gain more insight into the population dynamics we investigated the dead (unstained) foraminifera in the 2 - 3 cm level for the fractions 150 - 300 µm and > 300 µm. The fractions > 300 µm and 150 - 300 µm show nearly the same faunal distribution and therefore the results are presented here for both fractions combined (i. e. the > 150 µm fraction). Live foraminiferal densities show a clear maximum in the first half centimetre of the sediment; only few specimens are found down to 4 cm depth. The faunas exhibit a clear zonation across the Pakistan margin OMZ. Down to 500 m water depth, Uvigerina ex gr. U. semiornata and Bolivina aff. B. dilatata dominate the assemblages. These taxa are largely restricted to the upper cm of the sediment. They are adapted to the very low bottom-water oxygen values (ab. 0. 1 ml/l in the OMZ core) and the extremely high input of organic carbon on the upper continental slope. The lower part of the OMZ is characterized by cosmopolitan faunas, containing also some taxa that in other areas have been described in deep infaunal microhabitats...|$|R
