It uses many flexible iron teeth mounted in rows to loosen the soil before planting. It is set in the ground and raised manually and cannot be backed up; this is why it has been replaced by more modern equipment such as the chisel plow and field cultivator.|$|E
50|$|A drag harrow, {{a type of}} <b>spring-tooth</b> <b>harrow,</b> is {{a largely}} {{outdated}} type of soil cultivation implement {{that is used to}} smooth the ground as well as loosen it after it has been plowed and packed. It uses many flexible iron teeth usually arranged into three rows. It has no hydraulic functionality and has to be raised/adjusted with one or multiple manual levers. It is a largely outdated piece of farm equipment, having been replaced by more modern disc harrows and hydraulically operated field cultivators.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} general types of harrows: disc harrows, tine <b>harrows</b> (including <b>spring-tooth</b> <b>harrows,</b> drag harrows, and spike harrows), chain harrows, and chain-disk harrows. Harrows were {{originally}} drawn by draft animals, such as horses, mules, or oxen, {{or in some}} times and places by manual labourers. In modern practice they are almost always tractor-mounted implements, either trailed after the tractor by a drawbar or mounted on the three-point hitch.|$|R

5000|$|The Syracuse Chilled Plow Company, {{founded in}} 1876, {{was one of}} the first {{companies}} to lease space in the Geddes Street Lynch Building and were occupants before Charles Lipe bought the building in 1880. They built [...] "special plows designed for the light gravelly soils in the East." [...] Harry Wiard, descendant of Thomas Wiard, invented the chilling process in plow manufacture. The company was later purchased by the Deere family (of the John Deere Company) and offered a full line of chilled plows, both walking and riding models, including <b>spring-tooth</b> <b>harrows,</b> quack-grass harrows, potato machinery and grape and berry hoes. By 1879, the company was operating at the corner of Marcellus and Wyoming streets.|$|R
