It {{can also be used to}} stimulate pancreatic secretion (especially in conjunction with secretin) prior to obtaining a duodenal aspirate for analysis of enzyme activity, composition, and cytology. In some instances it is used to accelerate the transit of a barium meal through the small bowel, thereby decreasing the time and-extent of radiation associated with fluoroscopy and x-ray examination of the intestinal tract.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{review the}} role of <b>sincalide</b> in {{treating}} and preventing parenteral nutrition (PN) –associated gallbladder disease. DATA SOURCES A MEDLINE (1996 –March 2004) search was performed using the key terms cholecystokinin, <b>sincalide,</b> parenteral nutrition, cholelithiasis, cholestasis, and sludge. DATA SYNTHESIS Five human studies investigated the safety and efficacy of <b>sincalide</b> in patients with PN-associated gallbladder disease. <b>Sincalide</b> at intravenous doses of 0. 04 μg/kg 3 times daily increased bile flow and improved serum bilirubin levels. However, patients with advanced liver disease {{did not respond to}} <b>sincalide</b> therapy. Long-term follow-up data on <b>sincalide</b> effects on liver disease progression are not yet available. CONCLUSIONS <b>Sincalide</b> improved the signs of cholestasis. However, its long-term effects in preventing and treating PN-associated gallbladder disease remain unknown and its routine use for this indication cannot be recommended at this time.

40|$|Because of {{the current}} inavailability of Kinevac, the form of <b>sincalide</b> for {{injection}} approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), nuclear medicine clinics may consider alternatives, including purchasing a compounded product, and some pharmacists may be considering compounding this drug (1). However, several concerns relative to compounded <b>sincalide</b> make such practices ill advised. The FDA recognizes that pharmacists traditionally have extemporaneously compounded and manipulated reasonable quantities of human drugs on receipt of a valid prescription for an individually identified patient from a licensed practitioner (2). For more than 40 years, nuclear pharmacies have demonstrated an outstanding record of providing safe and reliable compounded drugs. However, evidence suggests that {{an increasing number of}} establishments with retail pharmacy licenses are engaged in manufacturing and distributing unapproved new drugs for human use {{in a manner that is}} clearly outside the bounds of traditional pharmacy practice. In several instances, pharmacies have cloaked large-scale manufacturing activities under the guise of compounding. The U. S. Centers for Disease Controls (CDC) continue to investigate a multistate outbreak of fungal meningitis in patients receiving compounde...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to evaluate the use of a commercially available lactose-free fatty-meal food supple-ment, as an alternative to <b>sincalide</b> cholescintigraphy, to de-velop a standard methodology, and to determine normal gall-bladder ejection fractions (GBEFs) for this supplement. Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers all had negative medical histories for hepatobiliary and gallbladder disease, had no per-sonal or family history of hepatobiliary disease, and were not taking any medication known to affect gallbladder emptying. All were prescreened with a complete blood cell count, compre-hensive metabolic profile, gallbladder and liver ultrasonography, and conventional cholescintigraphy. Three of the 20 subjects were eliminated from the final analysis because of an abnormal-ity in one of the above studies. Results: After gallbladder filling on conventional cholescintigraphy, the subjects ingested the supplement and an additional 60 -min study was acquired. GBEFs were calculated and ranged from 33 % to 95 % (mean SD, 62. 6 % 21. 3 %). Statistical analysis determined the lower range of normal to be 32. 6 %. Maximal gallbladder emptying occurred between 55 and 60 min. Conclusion: A standard methodology and normal GBEFs (33 %) were established for supplement-stimulated cholescintigraphy...|$|E

Cholescintigraphy with 99 mTc-hepatobiliary radiopharmaceuti-cals has been an important, clinically useful diagnostic imaging study for almost 4 decades. It continues to be in much clinical demand; however, the indications, methodology, and interpre-tative criteria have evolved over the years. This review will em-phasize state-of-the-art methodology and diagnostic criteria for various clinical indications, including acute cholecystitis, chronic acalculous gallbladder disease, high-grade and partial biliary obstruction, and the postcholecystectomy pain syn-drome, including sphincter-of-Oddi dysfunction and biliary atre-sia. The review will also emphasize the use of diagnostic pharmacologic interventions, particularly <b>sincalide.</b> Key Words: hepatobiliary scintigraphy; cholescintigraphy; acute cholecystitis; chronic cholecystitis; chronic acalculous gallbladder disease; biliary dyskinesi...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the use of a}} corn oil emulsion as an inexpensive alternative to <b>sincalide</b> in the scintigraphic diagno-sis of chronic acalculous cholecystitis (CAC). Methods: Thirty patients with abdominal or right upper quadrant pain underwent 99 mTc-disofenin hepatobiliary imaging for 60 min. After gallblad-der filling, 30 mL of corn oil emulsion were administered orally to all patients followed by dynamic imaging for an additional 60 min in all patients and for 90 min in 26 patients. Gallbladder emptying kinetics were determined with gallbladder ejection fractions calculated at 30, 60, and 90 min. The results were compared with histopathologic or clinical follow-up data. Re-sults: Corn oil emulsion was found to be palatable and free of side effects in all patients. Seven of the 30 patients had his-topathologic evidence of CAC, whereas the remaining 23 did not have evidence of gallbladder disease based on clinical follow-up. The 30 -, 60 -, and 90 -min gallbladder ejection frac-tions were determined to be 25 % 22 % (mean SD), 47 % 28 %, and 62 % 29 %, respectively. Receiver-operating-char-acteristic analysis showed that the 60 -min gallbladder ejection fraction best distinguished between CAC and non–gallbladder disease with an area under the curve of 0. 963. A 60 -min gall-bladder ejection fraction of 20 % had 100 % sensitivity, 96 % specificity, 88 % positive predictive value, 100 % negative pre-dictive value, and 97 % overall accuracy for the diagnosis of CAC. Conclusion: Standardized corn oil emulsion appears to be an adequate and well-tolerated gallbladder stimulant. Based on receiver-operating-characteristic analysis, a 60 -min gallblad-der ejection fraction of 20 % using this simple cholecysta-gogue results in high diagnostic accuracy for CAC.
