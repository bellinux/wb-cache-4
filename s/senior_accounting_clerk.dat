Dear Sir: I {{have been}} reading the November issue of the Bryant Alumni Bulletin, and have found it very interesting. In fact {{for the last ten}} years or so I have enjoyed the mail matter sent out from Bryant College and now I {{want you to know that}} it is appreciated. My home address is 200 Ash St. New Bedford, Mass., but at present I am a Storekeeper, second class (2 /c) in the Naval Reserve, and my present address is as above. All I can say about my present {{situation}} is that at times we sure have some excitement. (Have to write on one side only in case of censoring). Before entering the service, I was a clerk in the (New Bedford, Mass.) Post Office for a little over a year. (A civil service appointment after 5 yrs. On the list in 9 th place) Previous to that, I worked in the Boston Navy Yard, starting in 1939 as a typist, and when I resigned to take the above job in my home town, I was a <b>senior</b> fiscal <b>accounting</b> <b>clerk</b> (also a civil service job after being on the list for 3 yrs). In closing—I hope to continue to receive the “B. A. B” in the future, to keep track of all my old friends. Alfred Hearn Murphy (Business Administration) 1932 [Transcription ends...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} how some {{selected}} classical Pentecostal churches 50 in the Ashanti Region of Ghana could be proactive in managing their funds generated from their offerings above reproach 51. This {{has been done}} using both primary and secondary sources. With respect to the primary sources, the purposive sampling and the lottery system were used. Whiles the first method was used to sample the church leaders for interview, the other was used to sample a total of one hundred and seventy-one respondents from the congregations of churches 1, 2 and 3. Besides the researcher made several visits to these churches to observe most of their activities. It came to light that these churches have a lay down routine procedures that {{have been put in}} place to help their <b>accounts</b> <b>clerks</b> to prudently manage their funds. In spite of these routine procedures, the <b>accounts</b> <b>clerks</b> are not leaving above reproach and this is due to some challenges confronting these selected churches with respect to the management of their offerings. However, this issue can be minimized or perhaps over-come when the churches appoint qualified <b>accounts</b> <b>clerks</b> as full-time employees. The churches also need to go further by providing adequate office spaces equipped with the necessary machinery that would enable their <b>accounts</b> <b>clerks</b> to operate efficiently and effectively. 1...|$|R
