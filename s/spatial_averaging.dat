40|$|We {{consider}} {{statistics of}} <b>spatial</b> <b>averages</b> estimated by weighting observations over an arbitrary spatial domain using identical and independent measuring devices, and derive {{an account of}} bias and variance {{in the presence of}} missing observations. We test the model relative to simulations, and the approximations for bias and variance with missing data are shown to compare well even when the probability of missing data is large. Previous authors have examined optimal averaging strategies for minimizing bias, variance and mean squared error of the <b>spatial</b> <b>average,</b> and we extend the analysis to the case of missing observations. Minimizing variance mainly requires higher weights where local variance and covariance is small, whereas minimizing bias requires higher weights where the field is closer to the true <b>spatial</b> <b>average.</b> Missing data increases variance and contributes to bias, and reducing both effects involves emphasizing locations with mean value nearer to the <b>spatial</b> <b>average.</b> The framework is applied to study spatially averaged rainfall over India.

After attenuation correction, ZH and ZDR were significantly improved, and their scatter plots matched well with the theoretical relationship between ZH and ZDR.

The approach modifies the importance function which improves the sampling efficiency while keeping a defined relation to the original statistical distribution. In this work, <b>spatial</b> <b>averaging</b> is applied to multidimensional systems for typical problems arising in physical chemistry. They include (I) a CO molecule diffusing on an amorphous icesurface, (II) a hydrogen molecule probing favorable positions in amorphous ice, and (III) CO migration in myoglobin.

It is also found that optimal simulation parameters are surprisingly similar for the different systems studied, in particular, the radius of the point cloud over which the potential energy function is averaged. For H 2 diffusing in amorphous ice it is found that facile migration is possible which is in agreement with previous suggestions from experiment. The free energy barriers involved are typically lower than 1 kcal/mol. <b>Spatial</b> <b>averaging</b> simulations for CO in myoglobin are able to locate all currently characterized metastable states.

40|$|Abstract. The motion {{field from}} image {{sequences}} of a dynamic 3 D scene is in general piecewise continuous. Since two neighbouring regions may have completely different motions, motion estimation at the discontinuities is problematic. In particular <b>spatial</b> <b>averaging</b> of motion vectors is inappropriate at such positions. We avoid {{this problem by}} channel encoding brightness change constraint equations (BCCE) for each spatial position into a channel matrix. By <b>spatial</b> <b>averaging</b> of this channel representation and subsequently decoding {{we are able to}} estimate all significantly different motions occurring at the discontinuity, as well as their covariances. This paper extends and improves this multiple motion estimation scheme by locally selecting the appropriate scale for the <b>spatial</b> <b>averaging.</b> ...|$|E

It is often achieved by synchronizing the clock of each node in the network to the clock of some reference node. However, {{it is well known that}} synchronization error accumulates over multiple hops. This scalability problem presents a challenge for large-scale, multi-hop sensor networks with a large number of nodes distributed over wide areas. In this thesis we develop the use of <b>spatial</b> <b>averaging</b> as an approach to mitigating the effects of the scalability problem. We first develop a cooperative synchronization technique using <b>spatial</b> <b>averaging</b> that can achieve "perfect" synchronization in the limit of an infinitely dense network. We show that it is possible to maintain a perfect timing signal with equispaced zero-crossings that occur at integer values of the reference time. Second, we study the benefits of cooperative time synchronization using <b>spatial</b> <b>averaging</b> in networks of finite density. We present a protocol that uses <b>spatial</b> <b>averaging</b> to reduce error accumulation in large-scale networks and show that synchronization performance can be significantly improved by increasing network density...|$|E

30|$|By {{comparing}} Figs. 1, 2, and 3, it {{is immediately}} {{clear that the}} station-specific and spatially averaged extreme geoelectric fields can have very different spatial structures. While spatial correlations are clearly present {{in the form of}} alignment of the computed field vectors in Fig. 3, the magnitude in one of the locations is about five times larger than at the nearby sites at about 240 - and 280 -km distance. While this specific example is quite extreme in terms of local field enhancement, it does illustrate that localized features are observed during extreme storm conditions. In contrast, when <b>spatial</b> <b>average</b> is used to identify the maximum geoelectric field, as in Figs. 1 and 2, the geoelectric field structure is much more coherent over regional scales. We note that using <b>spatial</b> <b>average</b> as a metric does not imply coherence or uniformity of the field. However, as can be seen from Figs. 1 and 2, in these two cases that are the most extreme in the utilized data set, extreme <b>spatial</b> <b>averages</b> are associated with fairly uniform fields over regional scales. This indicates that <b>spatial</b> <b>average</b> is capable of capturing regional-scale geoelectric field features and is thus applicable measure for characterizing spatially uniform or coherent fields.|$|R

At low contrast, <b>spatial</b> <b>averaging</b> is greatest (about 11  min of arc) within uniform regions such as edges, as expected if the relevant neurons have orientation-selective RFs. At high contrast, <b>spatial</b> <b>averaging</b> is minimal.

40|$|Two {{approaches}} [...] one parametric and one non-parametric [...] to {{the source}} bearing estimation problem for narrowband passive sonar are presented. The parametric technique does not directly involve estimation of a spatial spectrum. Rather, an optimization problem is solved {{for a set of}} parameters (such as signal strengths and directions of propagation, noise strength, and inter-signal coherences) which minimizes the norm of the error between the parametrically expressed true correlation matrix and the estimated correlation matrix. Simulations suggest that this method is capable of resolving completely coherent sources separated by much less than a beamwidth at low (0 dB) signal to noise ratios. A competing non-parametric method uses <b>spatial</b> <b>averaging</b> to estimate spatial correlation matrices more accurately. <b>Spatial</b> <b>averaging</b> is shown to reduce inter-signal coherence. Two types of <b>spatial</b> <b>averaging</b> are discussed [...] subaperture averaging and redundancy averaging. Subaperture averaging is shown to increase the accuracy of the estimated correlation matrix and to reduce coherence without perturbing estimated source bearings. However, it is unable to noticeably reduce inter-signal coherence if the signals are closely spaced. Redundancy averaging is also shown to increase accuracy and reduce coherence and is more effective with closely spaced coherent signals than subaperture averaging. However, redundancy averaging may induce bias in estimated source locations if there are coherent sources. Our results indicate that the parametric method offers significantly improved performance over the more traditional methods. As <b>spatial</b> <b>averaging</b> is essentially a refinement of traditional methods, it is perhaps overshadowed by the parametric method. However, the parametric method requires further study to empirically determine its effectiveness and meanwhile, <b>spatial</b> <b>averaging</b> may be a fruitful way to reduce the negative effects of coherent signals on traditional bearing estimation methods...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Because of its {{ubiquitous}} {{release on}} land and wellcharacterized atmospheric loss, radon- 222 has been very useful for deducing fluxes of greenhouse gases such as CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O. It is shown here that the radon-tracer method, used in previous studies to calculate regional-scale greenhouse gas fluxes, returns a weighted-average flux (the flux field F weighted by {{the sensitivity of the}} measurements to that flux field, f) rather than an evenly-weighted <b>spatial</b> <b>average</b> flux. A synthetic data study using a Lagrangian particle dispersion model and modeled CO 2 fluxes suggests that the discrepancy between the sensitivity-weighted average flux and evenly-weighted <b>spatial</b> <b>average</b> flux can be significant in the case of CO 2, due to covariance between F and f for biospheric CO 2 fluxes during the growing season and also for anthropogenic CO 2 fluxes in general. A technique is presented to correct the radon-tracer derived fluxes to yield an estimate of evenly-weighted <b>spatial</b> <b>average</b> CO 2 fluxes. A new method is also introduced for correcting the CO 2 flux estimates for the effects of radon- 222 radioactive decay in the radon-tracer method. ...|$|R
