[...] Agnew later recalled, [...] "After we dropped our gauges I remember we made a sharp turn to the right <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> not {{get caught in the}} blast – but we still got badly shaken up by it."

After a couple of weeks we agreed that the show should go off the air in January, but {{continue}} production <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have 11 shows ready for airing any time they wanted them. Some of the nonsense and hijinks of the first season are gone and we have managed to keep a touch of reality of the second version.

2500|$|Reaction {{against the}} bill also spawned the National Committee to Uphold Constitutional Government, which was {{launched}} in February 1937 by three leading opponents of the New Deal. Frank E. Gannett, a newspaper magnate, provided both money and publicity. Two other founders, Amos Pinchot, a prominent lawyer from New York, and Edward Rumely had both been Roosevelt supporters who had soured on the President's agenda. Rumely directed an effective and intensive mailing campaign to drum up public opposition to the measure. Among the original members of the Committee were James Truslow Adams, Charles Coburn, John Haynes Holmes, Dorothy Thompson, Samuel S. McClure, Mary Dimmick Harrison, and Frank A. Vanderlip. The Committee's membership reflected the bipartisan opposition to the bill, especially among better educated and wealthier constituencies. As Gannett explained, [...] "we were careful not to include anyone who had been prominent in party politics, particularly in the Republican camp. We preferred to have the Committee made up of liberals and Democrats, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> not be charged with having partisan motives." ...|$|E

60|$|One of {{the most}} anxious periods of my {{experience}} during the rebellion was {{the last few weeks}} before Petersburg. I felt that the situation of the Confederate army was such that they would try to make an escape at the earliest practicable moment, and I was afraid, every morning, that I would awake from my sleep to hear that Lee had gone, and that nothing was left but a picket line. He had his railroad by the way of Danville south, and I was afraid that he was running off his men and all stores and ordnance except such as it would be necessary to carry with him for his immediate defence. I knew he could move much more lightly and more rapidly than I, and that, if he got the start, he would leave me behind <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have the same army to fight again farther south and the war might be prolonged another year.|$|E
