In this paper we provide detailed time-at-depth information for two blue marlin released alive from pelagic longline gear with pop-up archival satellite tags (PSATs) programmed to release from the animals after 30 days. Both blue marlin made several dives each day. The fish moved quickly to depth, and the times at depth were greater than those spent in descent or ascent. The depth of dives was greater during daylight hours. These data are suggestive of feeding excursions to deeper waters, movements for which these fish are well adapted with large eyes and a brain (eye) heating organ. If billfish undertake specific feeding movements to depth, then one would expect increased catch rates for deeply <b>set</b> <b>longline</b> gear. Researchers have recently attempted to standardize catch rates of billfish on pelagic longline for the time fish spend at depth (habitat-based models). However, if feeding motivation is not the same for an animal at all depths, then such standardizations will significantly bias catch rates and lead to errors in assessment...|$|R

A total of 3 328 fish and at least 36 species were caught with 33 600 hooks fished in 28 <b>longline</b> <b>sets.</b> Five species of sea breams (Sparidae) accounted for 79 % of the catch: Pagellus acarne, Pagellus erythrinus, Diplodus vulgaris, Spondyliosoma cantharus, and Boops boops.

Based on proportions of eight species and three broader species groups in 46 961 <b>longline</b> <b>sets</b> from 4 years (1991 - 1994) of commercial fishery data, five effort clusters were identified. Spatial distribution of sets and differences in fishing operations among clusters were then compared to reveal apparent differences in fishing strategies. Three clusters comprised N 80 % of the total sets, and the catch compositions suggested targeting for either broadbill swordfish (two clusters) or bigeye tuna. The other two clusters were most similar to the tuna cluster, but their catch compositions indicated a mixed-species fishing strategy. Fishing operations were most different between sets in the tuna and swordfish clusters. Swordfish sets were characterized by (1) the largest vessels, (2) the least number of hooks per set, (3) the greatest number of lightsticks, (4) the longest set duration, (5) the highest percentage of night sets, (6) a larger percentage of sets within the full moon phase, and (7) the lowest percentage of sets within the main Hawaiian Islands Exclusive Economic Zone.

As technical solutions to this conflict are limited {{and difficult to}} implement, this study aimed to identify fishing practices that could reduce odontocete depredation, {{with a focus on}} killer whales (Orcinus orca) interacting with Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) longliners off the Crozet islands. Data collected by fishery observers from 6013 <b>longline</b> <b>sets</b> between 2003 and 2013 allowed us to statistically detect the significant influence of five operational variables using GLMMs. The probability of interactions between vessels and killer whales was decreased by (i) the number of vessels operating simultaneously in the area: the limited number of depredating killer whales may induce a dilution effect with increased fleet size, and (ii) depth of longline sets: vessels operating in shallow waters may be more accessible to whales that are initially distributed on peri-insular shelves. The cpue was negatively influenced by (iii) length of longlines: longer sets may provide killer whales access to a greater proportion of hooked fish per set, and positively influenced by (iv) hauling speed: increased speed may shorten the time during which toothfish are accessible to whales during hauling. The time it takes for killer whales to reach vessels was positively correlated to (v) the distance travelled between <b>longline</b> <b>sets</b> with an estimated threshold of 100 km beyond which whales seem to temporarily lose track of vessels. These findings provide insightful guidelines about what fishing strategy to adopt given these variables to reduce killer whale depredation here and in similar situations elsewhere.

However, estimating the amount of resource depredated can be especially challenging when depredation occurs on fish in the marine environment. This {{is the case for}} killer whales (Orcinus orca) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) depredation on the demersal Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) longline fishery operating within the Crozet Islands EEZ (southern Indian Ocean). This study aimed at providing two indirect methods of assessment of depredated biomass over an 11 -year period (2003 to 2013), accounting for spatial variations of depredation levels. In the first method, fishing data from 6 525 <b>longline</b> <b>sets</b> were used to calculate the difference between catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of non-depredated and depredated lines. When killer whales and sperm whales occurred separately, 575 ± 35 tonnes and 739 ± 87 tonnes of Patagonian toothfish respectively were estimated to be depredated by the two species. When the two species co-occurred around vessels, 1 679 ± 74 tonnes were depredated. The second method used the differences in the proportion of grenadiers (Macrourus spp.) between non-depredated and depredated <b>longline</b> <b>sets</b> to estimate the number of depredated Patagonian toothfish. This approach, which can only be implemented when a sufficient level of by-catch species occurs, provides comparable results and thus strong support for the CPUE method. From these two methods, depredation rates were estimated to range from 27. 3 % to 29. 1 % of the total catch (landed and depredated), {{which is one of the}} highest among all similar situations where depredation is reported elsewhere in the world. In addition to providing a methodology that could be used in other areas with depredation issues, these findings emphasise the critical importance for fishery managers and researchers to account for depredation when assessing fish stocks, fishery economics and/or conservation of odontocetes...|$|R

25|$|A western-rigged trawler, David Starr Jordan was {{designed}} and rigged for midwater trawling, bottom trawling, <b>longline</b> <b>sets,</b> plankton tows, oceanographic casts, ocean-bottom sample grabs, scuba diving, and visual surveys of marine mammals and seabirds. She had a hydraulic hydrographic winch with a drum capacity of 15,000 feet (4,572 meters) of 5/16-inch (7.9-mm) line and a maximum pull of 1,600 pounds (726kg), a hydraulic hydrographic winch with a drum capacity of 30,000 feet (9,144 meters) of 3/16-inch (4.8-mm) line and a maximum pull of 1,600 pounds (726kg), a hydraulic combination winch with a drum capacity of 6,080 feet (1,853 meters) of 3/8-inch (9.5-mm) wire rope and a maximum pull of 6,500 pounds (2,948kg), and two hydraulic trawl winches, each with a drum capacity of 8,830 feet (2,691 meters) of 5/8-inch (15.9-mm) line and a maximum pull of 12,000 pounds (5,443kg). She also had a 50-foot (15.2-meter) telescoping boom with a lifting capacity of 11,838 pounds (5,370 kg), an 18-foot (5.5-meter) articulated boom with a lifting capacity of 4,650 pounds (2,109 kg), and a movable A-frame.|$|R

Mitigation techniques {{include the use of}} weights to ensure the lines sink quickly, the deployment of streamer lines to scare away birds, <b>setting</b> <b>lines</b> only at night in low light (to avoid attracting birds), limiting fishing seasons to the southern winter (when most seabirds are not feeding young), and not discharging offal while <b>setting</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
