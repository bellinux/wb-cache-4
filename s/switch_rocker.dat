We {{propose the}} use of tags applied to task-relevant locations in human environments {{in order to help}} autonomous mobile manipulators physically interact with the location, perceive the location, and understand the location’s semantics. We call these tags physical, perceptual and semantic tags (PPS-tags). We present three examples of PPS-tags, each of which combines compliant and colorful material with a UHF RFID tag. The RFID tag provides a unique identifier that indexes into a semantic database that holds information such as the following: what actions can be performed at the location, how can these actions be performed, and what state changes should be observed upon task success? We also present performance results for our robot operating on a PPS-tagged light <b>switch,</b> <b>rocker</b> light switch, lamp, drawer, and trash can. We tested the robot performing the available actions from 4 distinct locations with each of these 5 tagged devices. For the light <b>switch,</b> <b>rocker</b> light switch, lamp, and trash can, the robot succeeded in all trials (24 / 24). The robot failed to open the drawer when starting from an oblique angle, and thus succeeded in 6 out of 8 trials.

50|$|The {{original}} 1890s flashlights used a metal {{ring around}} the fiber body of the flashlight as one contact of a switch, and the second contact was a movable metal loop that could be flipped down to touch the ring, completing the circuit. A wide variety of mechanical switch designs using slide <b>switches,</b> <b>rocker</b> <b>switches,</b> or side-mounted or end-mounted pushbuttons {{have been used in}} flashlights. A common combination is a slide switch that allows the light to be left on for an extended time, combined with a momentary button for intermittent use or signalling. Since voltages and currents are low, switch design is limited only by the available space and desired cost of production. Switches may be covered with a flexible rubber boot to exclude dirt and moisture. Another common type of switch relies on twisting the head of the light. Weapon-mounted lights may have remote switches for convenience in operation.|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} {{design to}} the toggle <b>switch</b> is the <b>rocker</b> <b>switch.</b> Large switches of this design are {{commonly known as}} [...] "decorator style" [...] in the United States. Switches of this design sit almost flush with the wall plate, and are activated by [...] "rocking" [...] a flat, broad lever, rather than pushing a short protruding actuator up or down.|$|R

In Gen I and Gen II models, by default the shield returns to its lowest position when the key is off, however some riders choose to disable the 'return' function. In the Gen III model the windshield maintains its position until changed with the <b>rocker</b> <b>switch,</b> even when the ignition is turned off.|$|R
40|$|Currently, non-myoelectric {{controls}} for electro-mechanical prosthetic components include pull <b>switches,</b> <b>rocker</b> <b>switches,</b> harness pull switches, push-button switches, touch pad actuators (Universal Artificial Limb), touch switches (Steeper), and momentary contact switches Often these control systems {{prove to be}} invaluable Yet, at the same time, their incorporation into a prosthesis often results in a cosmetically unappealing prosthesis Furthermore, in certain situations the client may be restricted in range of motion due to soft tissue damage, extensive scarring, or other related problems which limit effective performance of conventional controls Recent experience shows that the application of Force Sensing Resistor's (FSRs) and Capacitive Touch Controls (CTCs) in prosthetics presently have specffic use An increased awareness of possible applications of FSR and CTC technology is anticipated to spark new and innovative applications {{in the fields of}} prosthetics and orthotics FORCE SENSING RESISTORS The FSR was developed (in 1985) initially for use in electronic instruments such as key-boards and drum sets This enables the musician to p ay louder when the instrument is struck harder, and quieter, when it is touched softly.

50|$|Panels are {{typically}} standard sized (Australian or European standard size) wall switch plates, {{but instead of}} normal <b>rocker</b> <b>switches,</b> they have buttons of various designs, usually with an indicator LED inside.|$|R
50|$|Instead {{of running}} mains voltage to the switches, a low voltage—typically 24 V AC—is {{connected}} to remote momentary toggle or <b>rocker</b> <b>switches.</b> The momentary switches usually have SPDT contacts in an (ON)-OFF-(ON) configuration. Pushing the switch actuator {{in one direction}} causes the relay contacts to close; pushing it {{in the opposite direction}} causes the relay contacts to open. Any number of additional <b>rocker</b> <b>switches</b> can be wired in parallel, as needed in multiple locations. An optional master control can be added that turns all lights in the facility on or off simultaneously under the control of a timer or computer.|$|R
50|$|On {{vehicles}} {{equipped with}} power central locking, the feature is activated from the inside drivers door lock switch only, by pushing the <b>rocker</b> <b>switch</b> to lock or unlock all doors. There is no label {{on any of the}} doors that suggest the door lock function is electric. Other doors can be locked or unlocked individually by pushing the respective door lock <b>rocker</b> <b>switch,</b> but it will not lock or unlock the other doors. The outside key door lock can unlock the drivers door only by turning the key partially, or with a complete turn to the left to unlock all doors.|$|R

50|$|For a short time, Australian <b>rocker</b> <b>switches</b> were {{exported}} to the United States in the 1980s.

50|$|New {{seats were}} fitted which allowed the fitment of head restraints, as {{required}} by U.S. law beginning in 1969.

The dashboard switches also lost their symmetrical layout.|$|R
50|$|Thirty-seven {{tracks were}} {{sustained}} or repeatedly percussive {{notes in the}} timbre of a particular instrument and were played through a standard three-octave piano-style keyboard with the right hand; twenty-one were of a live band or soloist playing chords in different keys arranged per the circle of fifths, specifically B-flat, F, C, G, D, A and E major, minor, and diminished and were played with the left hand in much {{the style of a}} chord organ or accordion. The remaining five were assigned to <b>rocker</b> <b>switches</b> above the chord buttons and featured (depending on the disc in question) percussion, sound effects, introductions, vamps, and endings synchronized with the chord buttons. Pushing upward on the <b>rocker</b> <b>switches</b> locked them in place for use with percussion; pushing downward allowed momentary use for vamps, introductions and endings.|$|R

50|$|The {{protein is}} thought {{to act like a}} <b>rocker</b> <b>switch.</b> It opens toward the {{extracellular}} space so that leucine and sodium ions can enter and bind to it. After that, LeuT undergoes a conformational change that releases both particles into the inside of the cell. Two sets of alpha helices are thought to perform the rocking action by directly changing its shape after the binding of the amino acid to the structure.|$|R
5000|$|The lens {{has both}} manual and power zoom (via a <b>rocker</b> <b>switch),</b> useful for smooth zoom motion during videography. Focusing is quiet. The lens has Panasonic's [...] "nano surface coating" [...] for {{increased}} contrast and reduced flare. The {{front of the}} lens neither extends nor rotates, beneficial for polarized filters. The 46mm thread diameter allows sharing of filters with the Panasonic 14mm, 20mm, 25mm, 45mm, and Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 12mm f/2 lenses.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to new controls for D-Mode and cruise control, several controls are different. There's a new rocker {{on the left}} hand grip that controls the heated grips and which page is displayed on the information panel; which function the rocker provides is controlled by a trigger switch near the left forefinger. The stop/run rocker is now stop/run/start with the last position being momentary; the hazard flasher button is where the starter button was previously located. A similar <b>rocker</b> <b>switch</b> for headlight control provides high/low/flash controls.|$|R
