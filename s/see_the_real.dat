500|$|To many scholars, [...] is a {{landmark}} Latin American novel because of Asturias's early use of magic realism, a literary technique often employed by acclaimed Latin American {{writers such as}} Gabriel García Márquez. In an interview with Asturias, Gunter Lorenz heralded Asturias as the inventor of magic realism, and even as its most successful practitioner. Asturias himself defines this style not as [...] "a concrete reality but a reality that arises from a definitely magical imagination... in which we <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> disappear and the dream emerge, in which dreams are transformed into a tangible reality". Richard Franklin argues that magic realism is most evident in Asturias's exploration and depiction of the innermost reality of the human mind. This exploration is combined with [...] "the material content of an urban mass caught {{in the grip of}} an iron regime" [...] throughout the novel. Franklin goes on to herald the synthesis of these two elements as [...] "a real contribution to the novelistic genre of America".|$|E

[...] White {{was careful not to}} use [...] "modern" [...] creature designs to ensure they did not fall short in Gunn's uniquely envisioned world. White and his team created upwards of 1,000 prosthetic makeup applications and 2,000 molds of different colored aliens. For the specific aesthetic look to the film, Gunn wanted to create [...] "a colorful science-fiction world", and include elements of 1950s and 60s pulp movies, citing the Ravagers' spaceships, which he compared to muscle cars, {{as an example of the}} latter. Science fiction artist Chris Foss inspired and helped design the final look of some of the spacecrafts that appear in the film.|$|E

[...] A reviewer from Kayrhythm.com said, [...] "The clip is fairly successful, despite its simplicity and sobriety, which probably result {{from a lack of}} budget. In the song, Kelly is very beautiful and very emotional because it gives way to sadness created by the decline of a relationship with her boyfriend. In the absence of a spectacular clip, Kelly still focused on her wardrobe, perfect for the occasion." [...] The reviewer pointed out that the video works because of Rowland having a good team behind her. [...] "Kelly's team is really good. Imagine the damage that Kelly could have done with the team of Rihanna!..." [...] Julia Guez of Ados.fr was also critical of the clip, saying, [...] "The aesthetic is the rendezvous, the Destiny's Child alum appears sexier than ever, but why has it increased the costumes?

Gumball (who is apparently unharmed) arranges a date with Fionna. At the Tree Fort, Fionna and Cake argue over whether or not Gumball asked Fionna on a date.

Eden Carter Wood of Diva magazine shared the same thought with Bradner and added that the book contained nice portraits of the artist. Arthur House from The Daily Telegraph was positive in his review, while finding the pictures to be glossy and enjoyable. Toronto Stars David Graham compared the book to Madonna's similar styled book called Sex (released in 1992). However, he found a [...] "distinct lack of fanfare surrounding the book".

The gift that his family {{possesses}} {{is the ability to}} [...] "unmake" [...] things, but his gift seems to manifest very late, and he is unable to control it. Later he seems to strike down his pet dog, and then destroy an entire hillside with his power. He decides the death was his fault, and horrified by the thought of his power out of control, demands that he be blindfolded. Orrec's battles with his power and its potential to destroy have been described {{as an example of a}} person's confrontation with their own shadow, a common theme in Le Guin's writing. The blindfold initially brings him some peace. Unable to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> world, he lives within the stories that Melle has told him, Eventually he begins to retell the stories to his mother, and to add to them himself. When Melle asks to see his face without the blindfold one last time, he realizes he couldn't have hurt her, and feels the [...] "dry fury of impotent regret." [...] After his mother's death he descends into grief and rage, which he eventually emerges from with Gry's assistance. At Gry's suggestion he begins to remove his blindfold to read the books his mother writes for him. Orrec comes to realizes that his father has unintentionally tricked him into believing in his wild gift, so as to protect his domain. He confronts his father [...] Orrec eventually realizes that he prefers [...] "making" [...] to unmaking. Gry and he get married, and leave the Uplands. Scholar Sandra Lindow has pointed out that Orrec's name is similar to [...] "auric", meaning [...] "related to hearing", and that it brings to mind the word [...] "oracle", describing his discovery of his power to create and perform. Orrec's emotional journey during his blindfoldment has been compared to that of the biblical character Jonah, as well as to that of Max in the Maurice Sendak children's picture book Where the Wild Things Are.|$|E
