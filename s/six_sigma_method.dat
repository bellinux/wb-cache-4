When the product quality has increased and the efficiency has also increased then it will reduce the competitive disadvantage level. The competitive disadvantage situation happened when the company had no superior value. In this condition the company had no ability to compete with competitors. In this situation the company will suffer a financial loss. There are many quality techniques. The company implemented the <b>six</b> <b>sigma's</b> <b>method.</b> <b>Six</b> <b>sigma</b> projects helped to avoid competitive disadvantage, the <b>six</b> <b>sigma's</b> <b>method</b> brings with its capabilities and skills that managements can use to build competencies that cannot so easily be bought on the market or copied by competitors.

5000|$|One final criticism, {{probably}} {{more to the}} <b>Six</b> <b>Sigma</b> literature than concepts, relates to the evidence for <b>Six</b> <b>Sigma’s</b> success. So far, documented case studies using the <b>Six</b> <b>Sigma</b> <b>methods</b> are presented as the strongest evidence for its success. However, looking at these documented cases, and apart from a few that are detailed {{from the experience of}} leading organizations like GE and Motorola, most cases are not documented in a systemic or academic manner. In fact, the majority are case studies illustrated on websites, and are, at best, sketchy. They provide no mention of any specific <b>Six</b> <b>Sigma</b> <b>methods</b> that were used to resolve the problems. It has been argued that by relying on the <b>Six</b> <b>Sigma</b> criteria, management is lulled into the idea that something is being done about quality, whereas any resulting improvement is accidental (Latzko 1995). Thus, when looking at the evidence put forward for <b>Six</b> <b>Sigma</b> success, mostly by consultants and people with vested interests, the question that begs to be asked is: are we making a true improvement with <b>Six</b> <b>Sigma</b> <b>methods</b> or just getting skilled at telling stories? Everyone seems to believe that we are making true improvements, but there is some way to go to document these empirically and clarify the causal relations.|$|R

Businesses today seek an effective corporate performance measurement system to maximize the bottom line.

Many existing performance measurement systems were designed to support business practices and to monitor progress. With shrinking margins and competitive pressures, however, corporate performance measurement systems must do more than monitor.
