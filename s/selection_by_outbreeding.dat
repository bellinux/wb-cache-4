[...] Early breeders were mostly interested in adding Siamese colouration to long-haired cats, and therefore reinforced the stock <b>by</b> <b>outbreeding</b> to Persians only to retain the Persian trait dominance. [...] However, by the 1960s, some were re-introducing Siamese stock and producing less [...] "Persian-style" [...] cats, In the 1980s, a concerted effort to re-establish the breed along more formally Persian lines ultimately caused the breed to be merged into Persian as a variant in some registries (e.g. in 1984 by CFA), and a decline in the [...] "old" [...] or Siamese-like specimens.|$|R

40|$|Morphological {{characterization}} of Madura cattle in Madura islands was done as an input for "action plans" of national animals genetic resources management {{according to the}} global system ofFAO. Assessments were done in Sumenep District and Pamekasan District, East Java. According to the body measurements, Madura cattle can be classified as a small to medium type with withers height of about 120 cm. Because of potential productivity in the limitation of environmental resources, Madura cattle can be classified as a "superior" cattle. Body measurements of Madura cattle {{in the present study}} were relatively the same with those of 50 years ago, indicating that there is no breeding improvement activities except natural selection. The variability of body measurements is relatively narrow. Improving productivity <b>by</b> <b>outbreeding</b> is needed. To conserve the unique germ plasm of the Indonesian genotype, such as Madura cattle and a possibility to improve their productivity by a complete prevention of cross breeding in the Madura islands needs further evaluation. ...|$|R

WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADYRetrospective proof of principle studies has consistently shown that high NIR viability scores are correlated with a high implantation potential of embryos. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have generally shown no benefit of the NIR technology over embryo morphology, although there have been some conflicting results between pregnancy outcomes on different days of embryo transfer.
