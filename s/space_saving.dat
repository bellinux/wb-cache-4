Marriott and the city also resolved their dispute over the room set-aside for convention business.

500|$|It is {{possible}} to design filters that operate internally entirely in evanescent modes. [...] This has <b>space</b> <b>saving</b> advantages because the filter waveguide, which often forms the housing of the filter, {{does not need to}} be large enough to support propagation of the dominant mode. [...] Typically, an evanescent mode filter consists of a length of waveguide smaller than the waveguide feeding the input and output ports. [...] In some designs this may be folded to achieve a more compact filter. [...] Tuning screws are inserted at specific intervals along the waveguide producing equivalent lumped capacitances at those points. [...] In more recent designs the screws are replaced with dielectric inserts. [...] These capacitors resonate with the preceding length of evanescent mode waveguide which has the equivalent circuit of an inductor, thus producing a filtering action. [...] Energy from many different evanescent modes is stored in the field around each of these capacitive discontinuities. [...] However, the design is such that only the dominant mode reaches the output port; the other modes decay much more rapidly between the capacitors.|$|E
500|$|Another {{space-saving}} innovation was {{the dielectric}} resonator, {{which can be}} used in other filter formats as well as waveguide. [...] The first use of these in a filter was by S. B. Cohn in 1965, using titanium dioxide as the dielectric material. [...] Dielectric resonators used in the 1960s, however, had very poor temperature coefficients, typically 500 times worse than a mechanical resonator made of invar, which led to instability of filter parameters. [...] Dielectric materials of the time with better temperature coefficients had too low a dielectric constant to be useful for <b>space</b> <b>saving.</b> [...] This changed with the introduction of ceramic resonators with very low temperature coefficients in the 1970s. [...] The first of these was from Massé and Pucel using barium tetratitanateO9 (Young et al., page 655) at Raytheon in 1972. [...] Further improvements were reported in 1979 by Bell Labs and Murata Manufacturing.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine {{parameterized}} procedural abstraction. This {{is an extension}} of an optimization whose sole purpose is to reduce code size. Previously published implementations of procedural abstraction have produced <b>space</b> <b>savings</b> if the instruction sequences are exact matches. We show that permanent <b>space</b> <b>savings</b> (compaction) are possible when (1) covering all inexact matches by several procedures and (2) carefully choosing the inexact match instances covered by each procedure. Our algorithms yield substantially better <b>space</b> <b>savings</b> in comparison to approaches constrained to use unparameterized procedures. 1 Introduction Powerful applications that are small and fast have always been desirable. Falling memory prices and higher chip densities mean that internal storage constraints should (theoretically) recede into the background. However, many computer users are unsatisfied as they often find that there is never enough memory for their programs. Compiler optimizations are usual [...] ...|$|R

Full production began September 8, 2010. For these markets, the Cruze utilizes a more advanced Watts Z-link rear suspension from the Opel Astra (J). Offered in LS, LT, LTZ, and Eco trim lines, both the 1.8-liter and the turbocharged 1.4-liter engines are offered, coupled with either a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. With a starting price slightly higher than most compact competitors, the base model Cruze LS is equipped with the 1.8-liter gasoline engine and comes with air-conditioning and power locks, the higher-level LT and LTZ models is fitted with the 1.4-liter turbocharged gasoline engine.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} produce {{large amounts}} of data. A key challenge is {{how to cope with}} the resulting bottlenecks. This paper introduces a highly efficient data handling method using parallel inter-processor traffic, called TRC. It is used to reconstruct the internal fields inside one or more regions of interest (ROIs) defined by the user. The method is implemented on top of OpenFOAM®, an opensource computational fluid dynamics (CFD) platform [1]. A well known CFD benchmark is used to demonstrate its efficiency in terms of the <b>space</b> <b>savings</b> obtained. The benchmark test-case is validated using experimental data from the literature. Several compression algorithms are applied to assess the efficiency of the method within a user-defined ROI, including ZIP and RAR [2, 3]. It is shown that in terms of <b>space</b> <b>savings</b> TRC has an efficiency of an order of magnitude higher, and that the efficiency improves as the size of the uncompressed data gets bigger. The <b>space</b> <b>savings</b> obtained with classic algorithms remain constant for more than 60 Gb of floating point data. The obtained results bring new perspectives to attention regarding data handling techniques for parallel numerical simulations.
