This led the NWS to release a statement of 2 ̆ 7 certain death 2 ̆ 7 if people did not adhere to the emergency evacuation messages. Millions of people fled the Texas coast. Using Hazleton and Long 2 ̆ 7 s (1993) taxonomy of public relations strategies, experimental methods were conducted with various evacuation messages to test emergency communication.

In addition, tests were conducted to measure source expertise, trust, and attitude depending on the <b>message</b> <b>source.</b> Results indicated that a national <b>message</b> <b>source</b> produced higher constraint recognition than a local <b>message</b> <b>source.</b> The national <b>message</b> <b>source</b> produced higher expertise, trust, and attitude then a local <b>message</b> <b>source.</b> The threat and punishment strategy produced the highest level of information-seeking behavior. Information-seeking behavior was the lowest when a persuasive strategy was used. Constraint recognition produced the weakest effect on information-seeking behavior. In conclusion, emergency management communicators must use the correct message strategy to have an effect on information-seeking behavior...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} we have {{witnessed}} the urgent demand {{in a wide variety}} of applications for wireless sensor networks, such as military surveillance, disaster relief, environmental monitoring, etc. In these applications, usually a base (sensor) station is responsible for monitoring the entire network and collecting the data (information). If any emergency or certain events of interest occur in any region, the base station, referred to as a <b>message</b> <b>source,</b> will propagate the information to all other nodes. However, such a scenario may not be practical. Quite often, the <b>message</b> <b>source</b> is not a fixed node. Instead, there may be multiple <b>message</b> <b>sources</b> in charge of different regions or events. On the latter circumstance, the challenging issue therefore becomes how to propagate information efficiently when <b>message</b> <b>sources</b> vary from time to time. None of conventional broadcast algorithms performs well in this case since at each time, the change of <b>message</b> <b>source</b> incurs a huge implementation cost of re-building a broadcast tree. To deal with this difficult problem, we make endeavor in studying the theorems and the algorithms for multiple source broadcast. The targeted algorithms should be source-independent to serve the practical need. In this paper, we formulate the Minimum-Latency Multi-Source Broadcast problem. We propose a novel solution using a fixed shared backbone, which is independent of the <b>message</b> <b>sources</b> and can be used repeatedly to reduce the broadcast latency. To the best of our knowledge, our work is deemed the first attempt to design such a multi-source broadcast algorithm with a derived theoretical latency upper-bound.

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the impact of appeal and <b>message</b> <b>source</b> credibility on consumers’ attitude with mediating role of consumers’ intellectual involvement and their risk taking level. The population of this study includes consumers of mobile phones (Samsung, Sony, Nokia, LG and iPhone) in the Bushehr city (Iran).

Profanity has serious connotations and is widely used both in oral and online communication, yet the effects of using profanity are not extensively studied. As maintaining one’s “personal brand” is important, it is key to understand how all word choice effects that personal branding.

50|$|The communication-based model, {{advanced}} by Duncan and Moriarty (as cited in Laurie & Mortimer, 2011) contends {{that there are}} three levels of IMC integration; Duncan and Moriarty affirm that the lowest level of IMC integration is level one where IMC decisions are made by marketing communication level <b>message</b> <b>sources.</b> These sources include personal sales, advertising, sales promotion, direct marketing, public relations, packaging and events departments. The stake holders concerned at this stage are consumers, local communities, media and interest groups (Duncan and Moriarty, 1998 as cited in Laurie & Mortimer, 2011). At the second stage of IMC integration Duncan and Moriarty (as cited in Laurie & Mortimer, 2011) establish that level one integration departments still have decision making power but are now guided by marketing level <b>message</b> <b>sources.</b> At stage two integration the <b>message</b> <b>sources</b> are those departments in which product mix, price mix, marketing communication and distribution mix are settled; appropriately, stakeholders at this stage of integration are distributors, suppliers and competition (Duncan and Moriarty, 1998 as cited in Laurie & Mortimer, 2011). It {{should also be noted that}} it is at this stage of integration that consumers interact with the organisation (Duncan and Moriarty, 1998 as cited in Laurie & Mortimer, 2011). Moving forward, the last stage Duncan and Moriarty's Communication Based Model (as cited in Laurie and Mortimer, 2011) is stage three where <b>message</b> <b>sources</b> are at the corporate level of the organisation; these <b>message</b> <b>sources</b> include administration, manufacturing operations, marketing, finance, human resources and legal departments. The stake holders at this level of IMC integration are employees, investors, financial community, government and regulators (Duncan and Moriarty, 1998 as cited in Laurie & Mortimer, 2011). At the final stages of IMC integration, IMC decisions are made not only by corporate level departments but also by departments classed in stages one and two. It is the inclusion of all organisational departments by which a horizontal, non linear method of communication with consumers is achieved. By unifying all fronts of the marketing firm, communications are synchronised to achieve consistency, consonance and ultimately strong corporate identity.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{cognitive}} interference channel with confidential messages is studied. Similarly to {{the classical}} two-user interference channel, the cognitive interference channel consists of two transmitters whose signals interfere at the two receivers. It is assumed {{that there is a}} common <b>message</b> <b>source</b> (<b>message</b> 1) known to both transmitters, and an additional independent <b>message</b> <b>source</b> (<b>message</b> 2) known only to the cognitive transmitter (transmitter 2). The cognitive receiver (receiver 2) needs to decode both messages, while the non-cognitive receiver (receiver 1) should decode only the common message. Furthermore, message 2 is assumed to be a confidential message which needs to be kept as secret as possible from receiver 1, which is viewed as an eavesdropper with regard to message 2. The level of secrecy is measured by the equivocation rate. A single-letter expression for the capacity-equivocation region of the discrete memoryless cognitive interference channel is established and is further explicitly derived for the Gaussian case. Moreover, particularizing the capacity-equivocation region to the case without a secrecy constraint, establishes a new capacity theorem for a class of interference channels, by providing a converse theorem.
