The present paper describes the effects of various conditions on friction torque in the first phase during friction stage for joining of carbon steels. The various conditions included friction pressure, friction speed, weld faying <b>surface</b> <b>diameter</b> and yield strength properties of both substrates, and per-heat of them. The following are concluded. (1) The initial torque and the elapsed time for initial torque to it were affected by friction pressures and friction speeds described above for joining of same yield strength properties and weld faying <b>surface</b> <b>diameter</b> substrates. That is, the initial torque increased with increasing the friction pressure and it decreased with increasing the friction speed, and the elapsed time for initial torque decreased with increasing the friction pressure and the friction speed.

Abrasive jets were introduced in the United States during the 1970 ’s, and were utilized merely for cleaning purposes. As the technology developed to include abrasive jets, new applications were discovered. This paper deals with different experiments which were conducted to study the influence of abrasive jet machining (AJM) process parameters on material removal rate and diameter of holes of glass plates using silicon carbide abrasive particles.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} how {{the relationships}} between the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability and the critical heat flux (CHF) and minimum heat flux (MHF) change under different experimental conditions. Experimental observations of the RT instability wavelength for various wire <b>surface</b> <b>diameters</b> and system pressures were analyzed to characterize the CHF and MHF in a pressurized wire pool boiling facility. Three types of heater <b>diameter</b> <b>surfaces</b> were considered: 0. 3, 0. 5, and 0. 7 mm diameter bare Ni-Cr wires. The experimental system pressure ranged from 1 bar to 9 bar for observation of the RT instability wavelength changes in the CHF and MHF with the 0. 5 mm diameter wire. High-speed video was used to analyze the changes in the RT instability wavelength under each experimental condition. The wavelengths at the CHF and MHF regions were characterized according to the heater diameter and system pressure. The results showed that using the change in the RT instability wavelength is a viable means of determining the variations in the CHF and MHF during pool boiling. &# 169; 2015 Elsevier Masson SASclose 0...|$|R

The wetting pattern geometry is a key factor for emitter distance determination as well as crop type.

This study has been conducted in Albaji region in km 25 on the Ahvaz-Andimeshk road, in order to estimate the geometry of the wetting pattern under the point source trickle emitters in sandy soil with different discharge. The emitters were calibrated to provide 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 liter per hour discharges. The maximum wetted soil surface and depth was measured by digging the irrigated soil.
