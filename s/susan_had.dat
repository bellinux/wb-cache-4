5|$|Meanwhile, Susan is dismayed {{to learn}} that Karl has moved in with Edie. She begins dating her doctor, Ron McCready (Jay Harrington), who informs her {{that she has a}} {{wandering}} spleen and will need a splenectomy. When Susan learns that her health insurance will not cover the operation, Karl offers to remarry her for his medical benefits. They agree to keep their sham marriage a secret from Edie and Ron. While under anesthesia before her operation, Susan professes her love for Mike to Ron, which prompts Ron to break up with her. Soon after, Karl leaves Edie, as his love for Susan has resurfaced. Upon learning that Susan is the other woman, Edie intentionally sets Susan's house on fire. In this time of need, both Mike and Karl vie for Susan's affections. She chooses to rekindle her relationship with Mike and Karl signs the divorce papers. Susan and Mike then make plans to meet for dinner at nearby Torch Lake, where Mike plans to propose.

25|$|According to RSMC Nadi, <b>Susan</b> <b>had</b> peak 10-minute {{sustained}} windspeeds of 230km/h (145mph) {{which made}} it a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. RSMC Nadi also estimated that <b>Susan</b> <b>had</b> an estimated minimum pressure of 900hPa (26.58inHg), {{which made it}} one of the two most intense tropical cyclones on record in the Southern Pacific. This record was subsequently broken in 2002, when Severe Tropical Cyclone Zoe had an estimated minimum pressure of 890hPa (26.28inHg) and became the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the southern Pacific and Australian basins.|$|E
25|$|In December 1991, Polgár {{achieved}} the grandmaster title {{by winning the}} Hungarian National Championship, {{at the time the}} youngest ever at 15 years, 5 months to have {{achieved the}} title. This beat Fischer's record by a month. Hungary, one of the strongest chess-playing countries, had all but one of their strongest players participate in that year's championship, as only Zoltán Ribli was missing. Going into the last round, Polgár needed only a draw to achieve the GM title, but she won her game against GM Tibor Tolnai to finish first, with six points in nine games. In January 1991, Judit's sister <b>Susan</b> <b>had</b> also earned the GM title. <b>Susan</b> <b>had</b> the distinction of being the first woman to earn the GM title by achieving three GM norms and achieving a rating over 2500 as previous female GMs, Nona Gaprindashvili and Maia Chiburdanidze, were awarded the title by winning the Women's World Championship.|$|E

25|$|After Buckingham's assassination, a {{large amount}} of satirical verse was {{circulated}} on the subject. Most of this reflected on how pride goes before a fall and the damage he had done the kingdom, while several pieces commended John Felton's action. The dagger, claimed to have been used by him, was recorded by a late Victorian gazetteer as still on display at the now demolished Newnham Paddox in Warwickshire.

25|$|On December 20, 1997, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS), {{started to}} monitor a weak {{tropical}} disturbance that was located about , {{to the northwest}} of Pago-Pago in American Samoa. Over {{the next two weeks}} the system gradually moved towards the west-southwest, without developing into a tropical cyclone. During January 2, a mid-level ridge of high pressure developed between Fiji and Vanuatu, which provided an area of low vertical wind shear. The system subsequently started to show signs of significant development, before early on January 3, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated warnings on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 11P. The FMS subsequently reported later that day that the depression had intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone, on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, while located near the Fiji dependency of Rotuma. During that day the system continued to rapidly develop with RSMC Nadi reporting early on January 4, that <b>Susan</b> <b>had</b> become a category 3 severe tropical cyclone, with 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 120km/h (75mph). During January 4, Susan continued to rapidly intensify with the JTWC reporting that <b>Susan</b> <b>had</b> become equivalent to a category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale as convection surrounding the system organized further and developed an eye feature.|$|E
25|$|Simeon Eben Baldwin (February 5, 1840 – January 30, 1927), jurist, law {{professor}} and the 65th Governor of Connecticut, {{was the son of}} jurist, Connecticut governor and U.S. Senator Roger Sherman Baldwin and Emily Pitkin Perkins.

500|$|One {{evening in}} July 1986, Charlene {{came home with}} a newborn baby and shocked her mother by {{claiming}} that he was her son. Charlene told Madge a story, so convincing that Madge believed {{she had become a}} grandmother. However, Charlene soon revealed that the baby was actually her half-brother Sam (Thomas Hamston; Scott Wealands). She explained to Madge that she had been helping to care for him, after his mother Susan (Gloria Ajenstat), turned to Charlene for help. <b>Susan</b> <b>had</b> had an affair with Charlene's father Fred, until he threw her out. Charlene knew Madge would not be happy looking after another woman's child, so she claimed he was her son. Soap Box author Hilary Kinglesy noted the situation helped expose Charlene's [...] "soft heart" [...] and her sensitive side.|$|E
500|$|Eventually Susan learns her tutor, John Bradley (Laurence Brewer), {{is behind}} the threats. <b>Susan</b> <b>had</b> trusted John, so she is shocked to find that he is her bully. Of Susan's discovery, Woodburne said [...] "It's so {{unexpected}} because it's somebody she believed to be of great integrity and someone who she thought was on her side". John, who {{is described as a}} [...] "seriously unhinged individual", kidnaps Susan when she confronts him. He holds her captive and becomes very angry. He confesses to Susan that he {{is behind the}} threats. He tells her that in 1995, when Susan was a teacher at Erinsborough High, she gave him a bad report and he failed his teaching course.

Woodburne told Jackie Brygel from TV Week {{that it was a}} [...] "very hot affair". Tom left the priesthood for Susan and she confessed her love for him. However, the relationship soon ended. Woodburne commented [...] "It becomes apparent to both of them that it is just not meant to be. They both reach a period in their life when they are feeling low and lonely and aren't feeling very good about themselves. They just realise that there is no future." [...] Tom returned in 2007 and he became Principal of Erinsborough High. He told Susan that he never stopped loving her and wanted her back. However, by then she was back with Karl.|$|E
500|$|The Hidden Planet by Malcolm Hulke was {{commissioned}} in December 1963 {{and at one}} point was to be the seventh serial of Series 1. The story would have concerned a planet in an orbit opposite Earth's, with a parallel but in some ways opposite society to ours; for example, women were to be the dominant sex and all clovers would have four leaves. The original script was sent back for rewrites, and due to a pay dispute the rewrites were not made until after <b>Susan</b> <b>had</b> left the series; this necessitated further rewriting. A third submission was similarly rejected as Ian and Barbara were due to leave, and the script was dropped. [...] The story was the subject of an April Fool's Day prank in 1983, when Doctor Who Magazine issue 76 claimed that one episode had in fact been filmed and rediscovered, and would be integrated into a twentieth anniversary special co-starring the Fifth Doctor entitled The Phoenix Rises.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the ridge}} of high {{pressure}} that was located {{to the south}} of the cyclone started to weaken, which meant that Susan started to move further towards the southwest. RSMC Nadi then reported at 0000UTC on January 5, that the system had become a category 5 severe tropical cyclone with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 140mph (220km/h), before reporting 6 hours later that <b>Susan</b> <b>had</b> reached its peak 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 145mph (225km/h) and a peak pressure of 900hPa (26.58inHg). Around this time RSMC Nadi reported that the system might of developed a double eye feature while the JTWC reported that <b>Susan</b> <b>had</b> peaked with 1-minute wind speeds of 260km/h (160mph) equivalent to a weak category five hurricane on the SSHS. As the system reached its peak intensity, Susan was moving towards the southwest and as a result, it [...] "posed a severe threat to Vanuatu," [...] however during that afternoon, Susan recurved towards the southeast [...] "just in time to spare Vanuatu, a direct hit.” After turning away from Vanuatu, Susan accelerated towards the southeast while remaining near or at its peak intensities, before starting to weaken significantly during January 7. RSMC Nadi then reported early the next day, that <b>Susan</b> <b>had</b> weakened into a category 4 severe tropical cyclone while it was located about , to the southeast of Nadi, Fiji, which was close enough for the system to produce gale force winds in several southern and western Fijian Islands. By 0000UTC on January 9, <b>Susan</b> <b>had</b> completely absorbed Cyclone Ron, before the final advisories on the combined system, were released later that day as it lost its tropical characteristics and became extratropical. The remnants of the combined system were then monitored for another day, until they were last noted during January 10, bringing an unseasonable cold snap to New Zealand.|$|E
