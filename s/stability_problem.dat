25|$|Bristol {{was awarded}} a {{contract}} to build three Badgers, two powered by the Dragonfly and one (the second) by a Jupiter. The first Badger flew on 4 February 1919 but crashed on this first flight with fuel supply problems. It was rebuilt with a larger rudder and delivered to the Air Board eleven days later. The second, Jupiter-engined Badger, flew on 24 May but was re-engined with a Dragonfly and was purchased by the Air Board in September. It had full armament and a fixed, rounded fin, introduced {{to cope with the}} heavier Jupiter engine. The Badger proved to have a lateral <b>stability</b> <b>problem,</b> an adverse yaw effect caused by aileron drag, and because of this, the third machine was not accepted by the Air Board. These first three machines were designated Badger I.|$|E

40|$|Mana {{computer}} {{programs have been}} developed for solving slope <b>stability</b> <b>problems.</b> Since slope <b>stability</b> <b>problems</b> can be characterized as optimization problems, many optimization techniques can be used for searching for the lowest safety factor for a given problem and the corresponding critical slip surface. Most of the slope stability programs use the direct search method which requires only the function value (i. e., safety factor value). In this thesis, a new optimization technique, the Broyden (1970), Fletcher (1970), Goldfarb (1970), and Shanno (1970) (BFGS) quasi-Newton optimization method, is used in conjunction with the STABR program of Lefebvre (1971) to solve slope <b>stability</b> <b>problems.</b> This method of optimization requires the function value and the first derivative value, which can be found by the finite difference method. A new program CSLIP 3, incorporating the BFGS technique, is used to solve a variety of realistic slope <b>stability</b> <b>problems.</b> It is determined that CSLIP 3 is reliable and efficient...|$|R

The options to cure this were discussed at length until Marshal Voroshilov, the People's Commissar for Defense approved the addition of anti-torpedo bulges in 1939 which would increase the ship's underwater protection and rectify her <b>stability</b> <b>problem.</b> The second part of the reconstruction was carried out between December 1939 and July 1940. A pair of bulges were fitted that extended from the forward magazine to the rear magazine that increased the ship's beam by [...] They had an unusual form that consisted of an outer void compartment intended to weaken the explosive force of the torpedo backed by a relatively narrow section immediately adjacent to the original hull that extended from above the waterline {{to the bottom of the}} bilge. This was divided into two compartments; the lower of which was kept full of either fuel oil or water to absorb splinters and fragments from the explosion while the upper compartment was filled with small watertight tubes intended to preserve the ship's waterplane area and minimize flooding from gunfire hits around the waterline. The underwater torpedo tubes were incompatible with the bulges and were removed at this time. The bulges increased her standard displacement to , increased her metacentric height to [...] and reduced her speed to [...] The Soviets took advantage of her extra stability to reinforce her deck armor by completely replacing her middle deck armor with [...] cemented armor plates originally intended for s. These were not ideal as they were harder than desirable for deck plates, but they did have the prime virtue of being free. At some point, the exact date is unknown, her 45-mm guns were removed and sixteen [...] 70-K automatic AA guns were added, three each on the fore and aft turret tops and twelve in the superstructures.|$|E

[...] The ship was delivered {{during the first half}} of 1960. [...] Like the Andrea Doria and Cristoforo Colombo, the Leonardo da Vinci proved to be a tender ship (prone to instability) in rough weather. [...] But the Leonardo da Vinci's <b>stability</b> <b>problem</b> was greater because of her larger size, and as a result 3000 metric tons of iron were fitted along her bottom to improve stability. [...] This made the ship excessively heavy for the power of her engines and led to extremely high fuel expenses.|$|E

Two Avrocar prototypes were constructed and completed a series of wind tunnel tests at NASA Ames in California and a 75-hour flying program at the Malton home of Avro Canada. The results of the testing revealed a <b>stability</b> <b>problem</b> and degraded performance due to turbo-rotor tolerances. Before modifications could be achieved, funding ran out with the final flight test program completed in March 1961.|$|E

50|$|From {{the time}} it entered service the SO3C {{suffered}} two serious flaws: inflight stability problems and problems with the unique Ranger air-cooled, inverted V-shaped inline engine. The <b>stability</b> <b>problem</b> was mostly resolved {{with the introduction of}} upturned wingtips and a larger rear tail surface that extended over the rear observer's cockpit. The additional tail surface was attached to the rear observer's sliding canopy and pilots claimed there were still stability problems when the canopy was open. The canopy was often open because the aircraft's main role was spotting. While the inflight <b>stability</b> <b>problem</b> was eventually addressed (although not fully solved), the Ranger XV-770 engine proved a dismal failure even after many attempted modifications. Poor flight performance and a poor maintenance record led to the SO3C being withdrawn from US Navy first line units by 1944. The older biplane SOC was taken from stateside training units and restored to first-line service on many US Navy warships until the end of World War II.|$|E
