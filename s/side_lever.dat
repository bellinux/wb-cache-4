2500|$|The plan {{met with}} opposition, as the British National Maritime Museum had prior {{claim to the}} 1907 built Reliant, as they planned to scrap the hull and {{preserve}} {{one or both of}} the <b>Side</b> <b>Lever</b> ( [...] or Grasshopper [...] ) engines and perhaps a paddle wheel. It was suggested that a deal could be done, if the SMM were to buy the Eppleton Hall and pay for the cost of fitting out the display for the NMM in exchange for the operable Reliant.|$|E
2500|$|Samuel Cunard's major backer was Robert Napier, whose Robert Napier and Sons was the Royal Navy's {{supplier}} of steam engines. [...] For the Britannia-class, Napier designed a two-cylinder <b>side</b> <b>lever</b> engine that produced 740 indicated horsepower, just ten horsepower less than Great Western. [...] Unlike most other Atlantic steamers, Britanniaâ€™s boilers were located aft of her engines and paddle wheels, {{resulting in a}} unique profile. [...] The ships had three masts and full rigging for sails. [...] To speed delivery, construction of the wooden hulls was contracted to three Clyde ship yards.|$|E

2500|$|The {{signal box}} dates from 1896, and was {{relocated}} from [...] East near Consett. It features assorted signalling equipment, basic furnishings for the signaller, and a lever frame, controlling the stations numerous points, interlocks and semaphore signals. The frame {{is not an}} operational part of the railway, the points being hand operated using track <b>side</b> <b>levers.</b> Visitors can only view the interior from a small area inside the door.|$|R
2500|$|The platen {{was mounted}} on a {{carriage}} that moved left or right, automatically advancing the typing position horizontally after each character was typed. [...] The paper, rolled around the typewriter's platen, was then advanced vertically by the [...] "carriage return" [...] lever (at the far left, or {{on the far right}} for left handed typewriters) into position for each new line of text. A small bell was struck a few characters before the right hand margin was reached to warn the operator to complete the word and then use the <b>side</b> <b>lever</b> to shift the paper {{back to the beginning of}} the next line.|$|E
2500|$|Work on {{the first}} Lanchester car had been started in 1895, {{significantly}} designed from first principles as a car, not a horseless carriage, and it ran on the public roads in February or March 1896. It had a single-cylinder 1306cc engine with the piston having two connecting rods to separate crankshafts and flywheels rotating in opposite directions giving very smooth running. A two-cylinder engine was fitted to the same chassis in 1897 and a second complete car was built alongside it. This led on to the first production cars in 1900, when six were made as demonstrators. These had two-cylinder, 4033cc, horizontal air-cooled engines, retaining the twin crankshaft design. Steering was by <b>side</b> <b>lever</b> not wheel. The gearbox used epicyclic gearing. The first cars were sold {{to the public in}} 1901. In 1902 Lanchester became the first company to market disc brakes to the public. [...] They were mechanical and on the front wheels only. [...] The discs were very thin and made of a very soft metal like brass. [...] Although probably leaving much to be desired, they completely fit the definition of a disc brake, and beat all others to market by many years.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{trousers}} creases {{occur on}} the bottom two-thirds of trouser legs, particularly {{around the back of}} the knee. Trouser presses are typically the tool for removing these creases without damaging the trousers. On a typical trouser press, the <b>side</b> <b>levers</b> are raised; and the trousers placed between the pressing plate and the cushioned heating pad. The press is slowly closed, the trousers gently pulled so that they align properly and the press dial turned on for heat. The press heats to around 60 C regardless of model type. It can take roughly 15 to 45 minutes to press the trousers depending on the model type and the thermostatically-controlled heating pad will warm up and gently press out creases and wrinkles without scorching the trousers.|$|R
25|$|The side-lever was an {{adaptation}} of the earliest form of steam engine, the beam engine. The typical side-lever engine {{had a pair of}} heavy horizontal iron beams, known as <b>side</b> <b>levers,</b> connected in the centre {{to the bottom of the}} engine with a pin; this connection allowed a limited arc in which the levers could pivot. These levers extended, on the cylinder side, to each side of the bottom of the vertical engine cylinder. A piston rod, connected vertically to the piston, extended out of the top of the cylinder. This rod attached to a horizontal crosshead which, at each end, was connected to vertical rods (known as side-rods). These rods connected down to the <b>levers</b> on each <b>side</b> of the cylinder. This formed the connection of the levers to the piston on the cylinder side of the engine. The other <b>side</b> of the <b>levers</b> (the opposite end of the lever pivot to the cylinder) were connected to each other with a horizontal crosstail. This crosstail in turn connected to and operated a single connecting rod, which turned the crankshaft. The rotation of the crankshaft was driven by the levers which, at the cylinder side, were driven by the piston oscillating vertically.|$|R

5000|$|In {{postulate}} one Archimedes {{states that}} [...] "Equal weights at equal distances are in equilibrium" [...] (meaning one equal weight on either <b>side</b> of the <b>lever</b> arm). At propositions four, and five, he expands this observation {{to include the}} concept of the centre of gravity; wherein it is proven that the centre of gravity of any system consisting of an even number of equal weights, equally distributed, will be located at the midpoint between the two centre weights (hence introducing multiple weights on either <b>side</b> of the <b>lever</b> arm).|$|R

50|$|Gnip Gnop (pronounced {{with hard}} Gs) is a two-player {{table-top}} {{game in which}} the players try to get all six balls to the opponent's side first. The game begins with three balls and three <b>levers</b> per <b>side.</b> The <b>levers</b> are for shooting balls to the other side. Between the two sides is a plastic barrier with its three holes slightly larger than the balls. There are three pink balls and three green balls. The game is enclosed in clear plastic to keep the balls from flying out.|$|R
50|$|Notwithstanding {{the story}} of the first plane he sold being a cast one, almost without {{exception}} the firm's early planes were dovetailed, many with screwed sides and many with the lever cap and screw system for holding the cutter. The Garden Street leaflet published in the 1850s shows a wide array of infill planes available: panel, rebate (single and double iron), mitre (with snecked iron), smoothing and joining planes, some with wedged cutters and others with lever and cap. Later in the century bull-nose rebates planes were developed by Spiers, and shoulder, chariot and thumb planes were also added to the range. Gun-metal was introduced for making plane <b>sides</b> and <b>lever</b> caps.|$|R
5000|$|.....I {{had in mind}} to {{have both}} an {{internal}} and an external brake on both wheels - hence the sixth hole just above the cam bolt hole. After giving the external brakes a good trial, I found the internal ones did all the work I required them to do; so I just cut out the external ones altogether, and connected the foot brake pedal {{to one side and}} the <b>side</b> brake <b>lever</b> to the other side, which means you only brake on one wheel. But this does not matter at all as owing to the axle being solid and both wheels and brake drums being keyed solid to it you get no skidding effect whatever.|$|R
5000|$|Built at Merchant's Yard, Limehouse as {{a wooden}} paddle vessel, Firebrand was {{launched}} on 11 July 1831. In 1832 her original Butterley <b>side</b> <b>lever</b> steam engine was removed and replaced in 1833 by a Maudsley, and Morgan's paddlewheels were fitted. She was rebuilt in 1843, gaining 13 ft in length, and receiving a oscillating engine manufactured by John Penn and Sons. Notably, Penn doubled the power output without increasing either the weight or space occupied. Firebrand was renamed Black Eagle on 5 February 1842.|$|E
50|$|In 1963, Bally {{developed}} the first fully electromechanical slot machine, called Money Honey (although earlier machines {{such as the}} High Hand draw poker machine by Bally had exhibited the basics of electromechanical construction as early as 1940). The electromechanical approach of the 1960s allowed Money Honey {{to be the first}} slot machine with a bottomless hopper and automatic payout of up to 500 coins without the help of an attendant. The popularity of this machine led to the increasing predominance of electronic games, and the <b>side</b> <b>lever</b> soon became vestigial.|$|E

25|$|The next {{cable car}} line to open was the Sutter Street Railway, which {{converted}} from horse operation in 1877. This line introduced the <b>side</b> grip, and <b>lever</b> operation, both designed by Henry Casebolt {{and his assistant}} Asa Hovey, and patented by Henry Casebolt. This idea was brought about because Casebolt {{did not want to}} pay Hallidie royalties of $50,000 a year for use of his patent. The side grip allowed cable cars to cross at intersections.|$|R
50|$|A high striker {{is usually}} {{composed}} of a heavy base, a long vertical tower, a bell, a puck, a lever, and a mallet. Initial versions of the base were of frame construction; later models were of unibody construction. The tower may be of wood, fiberglass, or aluminum material. The puck/dinger/chaser is suspended to a small groove that runs along the tower's length and can move freely up or down. The bell is identical {{to that of a}} traditional school bell in construction, mainly because it is to be struck from the <b>side</b> (bottom). <b>Levers</b> were traditionally constructed with a rubber padding above and below the end where the mallet is supposed to strike, in order to amplify the force and protect the lever. Long-handled 10-pound rubber mallets are used, but can vary depending on the high striker's size.|$|R
50|$|The {{resulting}} craft {{was seven}} feet long, powered by automobile batteries {{connected to a}} small electric starter motor. It weighed about 400lbs. Moveable fins on the exterior hull enabled the sub to dive while two-gallon tin cans inside could be filled with lake water using a valve made from a kitchen sink faucet. The cans acted as ballast tanks and helped maintain neutral buoyancy once the vessel dipped below the waves. A small pressurized oxygen tank allowed the sub to stay submerged up to 48 hours. The sub's operator navigated via a conning tower featuring clear celluloid windows on three <b>sides.</b> Hand-operated <b>levers</b> were used to raise and lower the diving fins and steer the rudder while a radiator petcock could be opened to regulate interior air pressure when necessary. The sub's entry hatch could be bolted closed and opened from the inside.|$|R
