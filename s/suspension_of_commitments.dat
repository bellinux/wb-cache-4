40|$|In this article, I explore issues <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> {{to truth}} in dating ads that use {{apparently}} impossible categorizations to project identities for ad writers and their desired others. The article {{begins with a}} brief overview of relevant aspects of Text World Theory (especially Gavins's work on dating ads), Sinclair's model of fictional worlds and Routledge and Chapman's account of truth-commitment in discourse, and proposes the need for a framework that allows for a partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> to truth. I then draw on the work of Ivanič and Weldon on identity in writing, in order to develop an account that offers a discourse- and genre-based discussion of how the intertextual metaphors in such ads are interpreted in relation to truth values. I suggest the default stance is that <b>of</b> positive <b>commitment</b> to literal truth and that, when this is not possible, a fall-back mode <b>of</b> negative <b>commitment</b> to metaphorical truth is preferred over an interpretation in which questions of truth are truly suspended. Finally, I consider a related category, of apparently negative dating ad identities, in order to suggest a functional motivation for the inclusion of elements that cannot be interpreted in truth-committed mode.

40|$|This volume {{deals with}} US {{policy and the}} end of the Bretton Woods fixed {{exchange}} rates regime between 1969 and 1973. It is based on the records of the three secretaries that served in the US Treasury under the Nixon administration (Kennedy, Connally and Shultz) on the files of their undersecretary for Monetary Affairs (Volcker), and on White House, NSC, Federal Reserve and State Department records. From the very beginning of its term in office, the Nixon administration included the need for a different international monetary system in the broad process of reshaping of US foreign policy that would take the forms of the Nixon Doctrine, Détente, and the opening to China. US economic and political exigencies called for a "flexible" system based on the dollar, intended to serve the trends toward growing transnational investments by US companies and banks, as well as the perceived need of a diminished financial constraint on overseas military commitments. However implicitly, and with a trial and error process concerning implementation, this entailed a de facto new conception of US hegemony globally, as well as a serious clash of interests with the West European allies in particular. As West European plans, to create their own shield against monetary instability, took on growing credibility throughout 1970 with the launching of the EMU and the Werner plan, US policymakers moved towards the unilateral <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> their <b>commitment</b> to Bretton Woods. This came on 15 August 1971, after months of deep internal debate within the administration, involving both economic and geopolitical reflections. The second half of 1971, as well as the year 1972, marked the beginning of a different phase. The US administration proceeded quite ruthlessly in the dismantling of the Bretton Woods system, sometimes actually using global financial instability to secure its objectives. A new conception of global American power was taking shape, and, for what concerns the Transatlantic relationship, a clearer definition of western hierarchies de facto replaced the idealistic visions of the "partnership" of the 1960 s...|$|R

40|$|International audienceNumerous archival {{documents}} {{show how the}} <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments by Philip II, in September 1575, on the contracts with Genoese bankers (asientos) induced a freeze of the domestic credit market in Castile through the bankers’ intermediation for asientos and the credit interconnections.

The evidence strikingly confirms that by his strategy, Philip II was able to remove the de facto ceiling on the domestic debt (juros) imposed by the fixed revenue <b>commitment</b> <b>of</b> the Castilian cities in the Cortes.

40|$|Arguably, {{eliminating}} <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments [...] {{periods when}} banks jointly refuse to convert their liabilities into outside money or other assets [...] {{was an important}} impetus for creating the Federal Reserve. Friedman and Schwartz suggest that a suspension in 1930 would have decreased {{the severity of the}} Great Depression.

We present evidence about <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments from an episode that is close to a controlled experiment for examining their effects. In 1861, about 44 percent of the banks in Wisconsin closed, 81 percent of the banks in Illinois closed, and noteholders suffered substantial losses. The historical record suggests a possible explanation: an effective <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments in Wisconsin but not Illinois. Historical and statistical evidence indicate that the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments decreased the number of banks that closed as well as noteholders' losses.

40|$|Article 27 - 2 of the Penal Code in Japan {{requires}} that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> {{execution of the}} sentence' should be judged in view of `the necessity and appropriateness of preventing re-offending'. Some, on the other hand, argue that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' should be "balanced" with the criminal responsibility of the offender, which is {{greater than that of}} those whose execution of the sentence is fully suspended and is smaller than that of those whose sentence is partially executed. However, I think that this method of judgment ignores the requirements of Article 27 - 2, simply imposing the `penalty' in the community, which has no desirable effect on the offender's rehabilitation. Furthermore, such method of judgment might assign a longer `penalty' to the offender whose sentence had been fully executed with short or no parole term, because of his/her criminal responsibility. In this paper, I reconsider the discussion on `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' and `full <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' in order to clarify the image of those whose sentence is `partially suspended' under Article 27 - 2.
