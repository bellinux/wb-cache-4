MÉTODOS: A influência da liofilização foi inicialmente avaliada em amostras de goiaba e, posteriormente, em acerola, manga, pinha, sapoti e uva. As modificações inerentes à seqüência metodológica foram testadas nos referidos frutos e em abacaxi, caju, maracujá e morango. RESULTADOS: As médias de fibra alimentar total obtidas para goiaba liofilizada e não liofilizada: 10, 47 %± 1, 15 e 10, 53 %± 0, 88, respectivamente, demonstram: boa reprodutibilidade do método e inexistência de diferenças significativas entre os tratamentos aplicados à goiaba e demais frutos.

RESULTS: The average total dietary fiber for guava, both lyophilized and non-lyophilized, were: 10. 50 % ± 0. 97 and 10. 53 % ± 0. 88, respectively, revealing good method reproducibility and no significant differences among {{the treatment}}s applied to guava and other fruits.

40|$|The {{fluctuations}} of {{the exchange}} rate of the domestic currency {{have been a major}} concern. Since the 1970 ’s there has been a debate on the relationship between exchange rate volatility and export flows. In the wake of the recent global financial crisis and rising food prices, this debate has become even more strident and the concerns even more palpable. South Africa has not escaped the debate. The exchange rate of the South African Rand has been undergoing a series of devaluations for several decades. In such a situation, exporters must contend with some exchange rate volatility which might have implications for export flows. However, in the absence of systematic study, neither the magnitude of the fluctuations nor their impacts is known with certainty and this presents immense policy difficulties. This paper seeks to provide answers to the most commonly asked question as to the magnitude and extent of such fluctuations and their precise impacts on export levels and the market shares of South African citrus exports in the destination markets around the world. The principal objective it to estimate the impact of exchange rate volatility on the competitiveness of South Africa’s agricultural exports. The paper reviews the theoretical literature in respect to foreign exchange market, Balance of Payments, exchange rate models and the evidence from monetarists and the Purchasing Power Parity. Laspeyres-indexed export prices, exchange rates and export volumes for maize, oranges, <b>sugar,</b> <b>apples,</b> grapes, pears, avocados, pineapples, apricots and peaches for the period 1980 - 2008 and exports to the European Union are modeled by means of ARIMA (AR) and Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARCH) and export demand equation estimated. The Constant Market Share (CMS) model was applied to assess {{the extent to which the}} SA citrus industry has maintained its competitive advantage in several markets. The overall results obtained strongly confirm that exchange rate volatility have a positive impact on the competitiveness of South Africa’s agricultural exports and that, despite the on-going financial crisis that has engulfed the world, South Africa’s citrus exports have maintained a healthy market share. This result is surprising but understandable in the light of the special arrangements put in place by South Africa’s monetary authorities to protect the Rand from over-exposure to global financial developments over the period under review. The important practical implications of these findings for the success of the agricultural restructuring programmes going on in South Africa are evaluated and discussed against the backdrop of the fresh debates on national economic policy management in the wake of financial meltdown that has once again threatened the financial stability of virtually every region in the world in recent years. </p...|$|E

Six month-old jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.) and <b>sugar</b> <b>apple</b> (Annona squamosa L.) plants were evaluated in 10. 0 L pots after eight days of water withholding, imposed by suspension of irrigation. Jackfruit water status was better than <b>sugar</b> <b>apple.</b> <b>Sugar</b> <b>apple</b> plants showed different daily stomatal behavior when well hydrated, compared to jackfruit plants under the same conditions. The gas exchange of both species showed sensibility to high vapor pressure deficit (VPD). However, under water deficit, photochemical efficiency dropped at midday in both treatments (control and water deficit) and both species showed low tolerance to high VPD and light intensity under greenhouse conditions. In contrast, some chlorophyll fluorescence variables showed good photosystem II stability at highest VPD hour (14 : 00 h). The present results involving carbohydrate metabolic changes revealed an accumulation of soluble sugars; moreover, protein and free amino acid contents in water stressed leaves also increased. These findings suggest an absence of damage to photosynthetic machinery for water deficit period. Jackfruit revealed greater tolerance to water deficit than <b>sugar</b> <b>apple</b> an important feature for commercial crops in northeastern Brazil...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{alternative}} methods for pest management is needed {{with the increased}} concern for adverse effects of pesticides for {{human health and the}} environment. The main goal of Our Study was to test the oil from seeds Of <b>Sugar</b> <b>apple</b> (Annona squamosa), all edible tropical fruit for pest control. The oil pressed Out of seeds was as effective in controlling the silverleaf whitefly, Bemisia argentifolii Bellows & Perring (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae), infesting leaves of tomato plants in greenhouse conditions as the recommended insecticide, with the advantage of not being phytotoxic. When observed with a scanning electron microscope, the seed oil caused whitefly nymphs to shrink and detach from the leaf surface. <b>Sugar</b> <b>apple</b> seed oil was also very effective in controlling the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover (Homoptera: Aphididae), on melon leaves and the Kanzawa spider mite, Tetranychus kanzawai Kishida (Acari: Tetranychidae), oil soybean leaves. The study revealed the possibility of developing the oil from <b>sugar</b> <b>apple</b> seeds, all agricultural waste, into a broad spectrum product friendly to the environment and human health for crop pest management...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the occurrence of Gonodonta larvae defoliating <b>sugar</b> <b>apple</b> (Annona squamosa) and atemoya fruits (Annona squamosa x Annona cherimolia L. Mill.) in northern state of Minas Gerais. Larvae were collected between December 2007 and January 2008 in Annonaceae plantation in the rural area of the municipality of Janaúba, MG. Adults obtained have been sent for identification. The species identified were Gonodonta bidens Geyer, G. nutrix Stoll and G. pyrgo Cramer. The infestation level observed in the orchard was 85 % of plants {{with the presence of}} Gonodonta larvae and the average defoliation percentage was 30 %. These are the first records of Gonodonta species defoliating <b>sugar</b> <b>apple</b> and atemoya in Brazil...|$|R

40|$|<b>Sugar</b> <b>apple</b> (Annona {{squamosa}} L.) is {{a popular}} tropical fruit and its peel is a municipal waste. An ultrasound-assisted extraction method was developed for the recovery of natural antioxidants from <b>sugar</b> <b>apple</b> peel. Central composite design was used to optimize solvent concentration (13. 2 %– 46. 8 %), ultrasonic time (33. 2 – 66. 8 min), and temperature (43. 2 – 76. 8 °C) for the recovery of natural antioxidants from <b>sugar</b> <b>apple</b> peel. The second-order polynomial models demonstrated a good fit of the quadratic models with the experimental results in respect to total phenolic content (TPC, R 2 = 0. 9524, p < 0. 0001), FRAP (R 2 = 0. 9743, p < 0. 0001), and TEAC (R 2 = 0. 9610, p < 0. 0001) values. The optimal extraction conditions were 20 : 1 (mL/g) of solvent-to-solid ratio, 32. 68 % acetone, and 67. 23 °C for 42. 54 min under ultrasonic irradiation. Under these conditions, the maximal yield of total phenolic content was 26. 81 (mg GA/g FW). The experimental results obtained under optimal conditions agreed well with the predicted results. The application of ultrasound markedly decreased extraction time and improved the extraction efficiency, compared with the conventional methods...|$|R
