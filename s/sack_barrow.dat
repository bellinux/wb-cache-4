50|$|A hand truck, {{also known}} as a dolly, two wheeler, stack truck, trolley, trundler, box cart, trolley truck, <b>sack</b> <b>barrow,</b> sack truck, or bag barrow, is an L-shaped box-moving {{handcart}} with handles at one end, wheels at the base, with a small ledge to set objects on, flat against the floor when the hand-truck is upright. The objects to be moved are tilted forward, the ledge is inserted underneath them, and the objects allowed to tilt back and rest on the ledge. The truck and object are then tilted backward until the weight is balanced over the large wheels, making otherwise bulky and heavy objects easier to move. It is a first-class lever.|$|E
50|$|Atkins left, and fan {{favourite}} Graham Barrow {{returned as}} manager, as did another former manager, Harry McNally in a consultancy role. Barrow completely rebuilt the team, and his side managed a respectable ninth place {{and won the}} Conference Trophy in the 2000-01 season, and were mentioned as possible promotion contenders for the next season. In spite of this, Smith <b>sacked</b> <b>Barrow,</b> branding the season a failure, and appointed Gordon Hill, an ex-Manchester United and England player.|$|R
50|$|Edmondson spent around {{half his}} {{professional}} playing career with Carlisle after signing {{as a youth}} player in 1990, later having four years with York City and shorter spells at four other clubs. In 2006, he joined semi-professional Workington, becoming player-manager a year later. He was with Workington until 2013, becoming the club's longest serving manager. He left to join local rivals Barrow as manager, with whom he won the Conference North in 2015. He has been at Carlisle since June 2016, after being <b>sacked</b> by <b>Barrow</b> late in 2015.|$|R
2500|$|On 19 March, I Anzac Corps {{was ordered}} to advance on Lagnicourt and Noreuil, under the {{impression}} that the fires that could be seen foreshadowed a retirement beyond the Hindenburg Line. The 2nd Australian Division and the 5th Australian Division were past Bapaume, towards Beaumetz and Morchies and followed up the withdrawal of the 26th Reserve Division from Vaux-Vraucourt. Beaumetz was captured by 22 March and then lost during the night to a German counter-attack, which led the Australians to plan the capture of Doignies and Louveral with the 15th Brigade in daylight, without artillery or flank support. The plan was countermanded by the divisional commander, Major-General Talbot Hobbs, as soon as he heard of it and Brigadier-General Elliott was nearly sacked. The 7th Division commander, after the costly repulse at Bucquoy, delayed his [...] advance on Ecoust and Croisilles, to liaise with the 58th Division to the north-west. Gough ordered the attack on Croisilles to begin without delay but the advance was stopped by the Germans at a belt of uncut wire {{on the outskirts of the}} village. Gough <b>sacked</b> <b>Barrow</b> and left his replacement, Major-General T. Shoubridge, under no doubt about the need for haste. The Hindenburg Line was unfinished on the Fifth Army front and a rapid advance through the German rearguards in the outpost villages, might make a British attack possible before the Germans were able to make the line [...] "impregnable". The village eventually fell on 2 April, during a larger co-ordinated attack on a [...] front, by the I Anzac Corps on the right flank and the 7th and 21st divisions of V Corps on the left, after four days of bombardment and wire-cutting.|$|R
50|$|Barrow {{finished}} fourth in 2010 with coach Steve McCormack leaving {{the club to}} take up a teaching post. After a lengthy search for a new coach, Barrow plumped for Garry Schofield. Schofield was sacked as coach after only five games in 2011 and his assistant Nigel Wright was appointed as head coach. With 6 games to go in July <b>Barrow</b> <b>sacked</b> Nigel Wright and appointed old coach Dave Clarke as their manager {{for the rest of the}} season. The on-field problems were matched by off-field difficulties, with the club accused of breaking salary cap rules. This was eventually found to be so and all of Barrow's points were deducted for the 2011 season, relegating them to the Co-operative Championship 1 for the 2012 season. Barrow were promoted directly back up to the Championship, where they have competed since 2013.|$|R
50|$|Cowboys coach Dave Campo benched Clint Stoerner {{after his}} fourth interception, {{and with the}} first three quarterbacks on the team out, Ryan Leaf came in for his first {{appearance}} as a Dallas Cowboy, {{as well as his}} first game after his disastrous tenure with the Chargers. His appearance in this game brought more of the same as a Micheal <b>Barrow</b> <b>sack</b> of Leaf forced a Cowboys punt on overtime's first possession. A 33 yard pass from Kerry Collins to Ike Hilliard put the Giants in Cowboys territory, and disaster nearly struck when Tiki Barber fumbled after catching a 10 yard pass from Collins, but he recovered his own fumble and the Giants were in field goal range. Morten Andersen this time came through on a more manageable 42 yard attempt, and the Giants completed their double-digit comeback win.|$|R
50|$|The Giants' home matchup {{with the}} Seahawks {{started with the}} two teams trading {{touchdown}}s in the first quarter. Shaun Alexander opened the scoring with a 29 yard touchdown run for the Seahawks, but Ron Dayne answered with a 31 yard touchdown to tie the score. In the second quarter, linebacker Micheal <b>Barrow</b> <b>sacked</b> Matt Hasselbeck and forced him to fumble, with Michael Strahan recovering the loose ball and returning it 13 {{yards for a touchdown}} to give the Giants their first lead of the day, 14-10. However later in the quarter, the Seahawks also scored a defensive touchdown. Antonio Cochran sacked Kerry Collins and forced him to fumble, with defensive tackle John Randle recovering the ball in the end zone for the Seahawks to regain the lead. A Morten Andersen 32 yard field goal tied the score at 17-17 for halftime.|$|R
