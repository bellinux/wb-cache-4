40|$|Background: Osteosarcoma is {{the most}} common primary bone {{malignancy}} in children and young adults. Most failures of osteosarcoma treatment were due to resistance to chemotherapy. Development of new therapy required elucidation underlying molecular mechanism. Many miRNAs have been proved {{to be involved in the}} pathogenesis of osteosarcoma. Methods: MiR- 3928 expression level was assayed by qRT-PCR. MiRNA mimics or ASO were transfected for up-regulation or down-regulation of miR- 3928 expression. Cell proliferation was assayed by formazan test. Apoptosis and cell cycle were assayed by FACS. MiR- 3928 targeted genes were predicated by bioinformatics algorithm (TargetScanHuman). The correlation between targeted gene and miR- 3928 was analyzed by Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis. Results: MiR- 3928 was down-regulated in osteosarcoma tissues. Over-expression of miR- 3928 inhibited tumor growth, induced cell apoptosis, increased the percent of cells in G 1 phrase and decreased the percent of cells in <b>S</b> <b>phrase.</b> Down-regulation of miR- 3928 promoted cell proliferation.

The essay takes as its starting point the first words spoken in DeLillo s text, I want to say something but what, a quasi question directed to Lauren by her husband Rey, in order to ask if it can ever be said what lies on the other side of what, or if it remains forever unknowable, or unheard, at an infinite remove, even if it is one s self.   It is Rey s suicide, and Lauren s subsequent work of mourning, which locates DeLillo <b>s</b> <b>phrase</b> within the context of Derrida s efforts, again and again, to give words to those whose voices are absent: the lost friend, the other self, the dead.

40|$|In this essay, I {{shall make}} the {{argument}} that, although the arts have {{been the victim of}} economism and instrumentalism, their power is such that, if only we could truly tap into it, arts can become our healing medicine.   But, for the arts to become such medicine, they have to be understood and undertaken in a better light than they conventionally have been in our culture. The conventional understanding equates arts with the domain of the beautiful.   This view stems from Western intellectual and artistic traditions, wherein the beautiful and the good are considered two not only distinct but separate qualities and values. Thus, aesthetics has been the pursuit of the beautiful, while ethics is the pursuit of the good.   But if we go to Zen or Taoist thought, we encounter a different tradition of intellectual discourse and life practices wherein aesthetics and ethics merge and become two aspects of the same radical (in the sene of the root) human experience, techincally called the 2 ̆ 7 nonduality 2 ̆ 7 in Buddhist literature.   As I shall show, in this radical experience of nonduality lies the key to the resistance against economism and instrumentalism.

Nothing can be further from truth and close to absurdity than the notion that the arts are a luxury item and have primarily recreational and ornamental values.          ...|$|E

The first of these interests is represented by the collectors, art galleries, and museums, which have appropriated folk culture and vernacular creativity for the possession and presentation of it in foreign cultural contexts (meaning those elite contexts that are by definition 2 ̆ 2 non-folk 2 ̆ 2). The other actors in this intellectual drama are folklorists and material culture scholars who have placed their appreciation of vernacular creativity within the emic realm of natural context and have, through this turn towards native cultural contexts, have intellectually and morally positioned themselves in strict contrast to the cultural capitalists 2 ̆ 7 [...] -to turn on Bourdieu 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>phrase</b> (1984) [...] -of the elite artworld. ^ Folklorists, in particular, have embraced a disciplinary 2 ̆ 2 perogative of representation 2 ̆ 2 (Cantwell 2001 : 63) as a space for advocacy and intervention on behalf of the folk artist and vernacular creator in ethical and philosophical response to inequities in social and political power facing everyday artists in the mainstream artworld.

40|$|The {{language}} of plants saturated the English print marketplace {{in the sixteenth}} and seventeenth centuries, as printers turned out an extraordinary number of instructional manuals on gardening and husbandry, retailing useful knowledge to a growing class of literate landowners and pleasure gardeners. In those same decades, increasing numbers of miscellanies were issued under titles drawn from the world of plants: poetical gardens, devotional nosegays, forests and bowers of practical wisdom. 2 ̆ 2 Bound Flowers, Loose Leaves 2 ̆ 2 examines these parallel trends as part of a single phenomenon. Against the unknowns of a new and expanding market, the horticultural processes evoked by these diverse texts naturalize the anonymous futures of print publication, situating the new adventure of print within that most ancient discipline of risk management: agriculture. This dissertation argues that these vegetable discourses fundamentally shaped how English readers understood the printed book. With remarkable frequency, printed books turned to a botanical idiom to describe their prodigious capacity to scatter, gather, and multiply, especially in the small literary forms of couplets, posies, and sentences. Showing how plant life became fundamental to how the world was imagined and known in print, I argue that the portability of these 2 ̆ 2 handles of knowledge, 2 ̆ 2 in Philip Sidney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>phrase,</b> drove the production of both figurative language and natural knowledge in early modern England.

I extend Rich 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>phrase</b> to theorize how radical, lesbian feminists have used a politics of location as a signifying practice to construct alternative subjectivities and assert discursive agency.;More specifically, in this project I historicize and contextualize a politics of location as it developed within lesbian feminist interchanges during the 1980 s and early 90 s. This is a significant historical juncture for two reasons. First, the universal concept of 2 ̆ 2 woman 2 ̆ 2 came under radical critique by third-space feminists. Second, feminist publishing houses began to proliferate as a counter-public context for the dissemination of new voices and knowledges, thus allowing for the invention of new discursive strategies within feminist conversations. After historicizing a politics of location, I trace its development as a rhetorical strategy deployed specifically within interchanges between radical, lesbian feminists. Additionally, I use a Foucauldian theory of discursive formations to show how this rhetorical strategy interrupts the normative subject of the rhetorical tradition. Finally, I show how a politics of location contributes to the growing field of research on feminist rhetorical theory...|$|E

However, it is still an open {{question as to whether}} this conclusion can be applied to logographic Chinese, differing drastically from alphabetic languages. For example, in Chinese words do not generally have explicit grammatical markers, and syntax and semantics are relatively closely inter-related. Because previous studies adopting Chinese materials mainly employed violation paradigms to investigate the neural networks of Chinese syntactic, further studies are needed to investigate how the different tasks modulate the neural bases of Chinese syntactic, especially under the implicit syntax tasks. The present study used high spatial resolution fMRI technique to investigate Chinese two-word phrase processing. The factors of syntactic construction and task demand were orthogonally manipulated. Specifically, 120 phrases were constructed and were evenly divided into four syntactic construction types while phrase familiarity, frequency and visual complexity (i. e., number of strokes) were matched across types: 30 nounadjective argument, 30 verb-noun argument, 30 adjective-noun modification and 30 adjective-adjective parallel constructions. Participants were asked to finish two tasks for each of these phrases, i. e., 1 -back syntactic construction task and 1 -back word task. For the 1 -back syntactic construction task, they should respond if the syntactic construction of the current phrase matched with the previous phrase, and, for the 1 -back word task, they should respond if either word in the current phrase matched with a word in the previous phrase. Each task consisted of 3 blocks and the order of the task was counterbalanced across participants.
