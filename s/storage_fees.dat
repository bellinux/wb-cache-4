The Haslett warehouse, between Fisherman's Wharf and the Hyde Street Pier, {{was used for}} storage. With groundbreaking set for July 1931 and the last freighter carrying stones still in transit, Hearst stopped his grand plan for Wyntoon because his fortunes were too far reduced from the Great Depression. The stones stayed in the warehouse, incurring annual <b>storage</b> <b>fees</b> of $15,000 in 1930s dollars.|$|E

A production-sales {{model is}} {{proposed}} for a model group company {{consisting of a}} manufacturing plant and a retail store. The present model covers the Make-to-Order and Make-to-Stock models. The customer demand for a product during a unit period fluctuates by a probability distribution. The retail store maintains some inventory storage in order to prepare for sales. If the inventory storage is insufficient, the retail store requests the manufacturing plant to supply additional volume, and the store may lose some profit because of a deficient yield {{in the number of}} customers willing to wait for the supply. The Make-to-Order model is based on a high customer yield and the Make-to-Stock model is based on a low inventory <b>storage</b> <b>fee.</b> The production sales profit of the model group company is formulated in terms of the following parameters: inventory <b>storage</b> <b>fee</b> and customer yield percentage. By maximizing the production sales profit, the problem of finding the amount of inventry storage yielding the most profit is solved. An index of "Propensity to Stock" is defined in the present production sales model. For a product with a positive propensity to stock, inventory storage of the product is favored to make the production-sales more profitable. On the other hand, for a product with a negative propensity to stock, production on demand for the product is favored. Thus, the propensity to stock for a particular product indicates whether a Production-Sales model, Make-to-Order model or Make-to-Stock model is the most profitable...|$|R

The state also filed a lawsuit in Coos County, demanding removal, <b>storage</b> <b>fees</b> of USD$1,500 per day, restoration of the beach, and other unspecified damages. The state alleged negligence on the part of Morgado and also accused Green Atlas shipping of attempting to avoid the expense of the stern dismantling. [...] On November 13, 2002, a Coos County jury found the ship's owners guilty of negligent trespass after a six-week trial; the state was awarded US$25million in damages.

The circuit court judge later remarked that the case was the most memorable of his 37-year career, noting that [...] "You don’t usually get trespass cases that involve a ship". On May 23, 2006, a settlement was reached in the appeal; the state kept US$20million of the US$25million in escrow, plus US$2.1million in interest earned on the escrow account. The remaining US$5million was returned to Green Atlas Shipping. Of the US$22.1million that the state was awarded in the settlement, US$3.1million was used to pay the state's legal fees. The remaining US$19million was reserved for cleanup, including the removal of the vessel's stern.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a retailer with limited storage capacity selling n independent products. Each product {{is produced by}} a distinct manufacturer, who is offered a consignment contract with revenue sharing by the retailer. The retailer first sets a common revenue share for all products, and each manufacturer then determines the retail price and production quantity for his product. Under certain conditions on price elasticities and cost fractions, we find a unique optimal revenue share for all products. Surprisingly, it is optimal for the retailer not to charge any <b>storage</b> <b>fee</b> in many situations even if she is allowed to do so. Both the retailer’s and manufacturers’ profits first increase and then remain constant as the capacity increases, which implies that an optimal capacity exists. We also find that the decentralized system requires no larger storage space than the centralized system {{at the expense of}} channel profit. If products are complementary, as the degree of complementarity increases, the retailer will decrease her revenue share to encourage the manufacturers to lower their prices...|$|R

40|$|Background. Assisted {{reproductive}} {{techniques have}} been used in China for more than 20 years. This study investigates the attitudes of surplus embryo holders towards embryos storage and donation for medical research. Methods. A total of 363 couples who had completed in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment and had already had biological children but who still had frozen embryos in storage were invited to participate. Interviews were conducted by clinics in a narrative style. Results. Family size was the major reason for participants’ (dis) continuation of embryo storage; moreover, the moral status of embryos was an important factor for couples choosing embryo storage, while the <b>storage</b> <b>fee</b> was an important factor for couples choosing embryo disposal. Most couples discontinued the storage of their embryos once their children were older than 3 years. In our study, 58. 8 % of the couples preferred to dispose of surplus embryos rather than donate them to research, citing a lack of information and distrust in science as significant reasons for their decision. Conclusions. Interviews regarding frozen embryos, including patients’ expectations for embryo storage and information to assist them with decisions regarding embryo disposal, are beneficial for policies addressing embryo disposition and embryo donation in China...|$|R

40|$|To {{address the}} {{proliferation}} risk of separated plutonium, a technical and institutional design {{of an international}} plutonium storage system (IPSS) is presented. The IPSS is evaluated from two perspectives: its ability to address the proliferation risk of excess civilian inventories, {{and its ability to}} reduce the threat from excess Russian military plutonium. A systems dynamic model of global plutonium inventories projects a capacity requirement for an IPSS of 450 to 600 MT. A conceptual design of a representative 100 MT storage facility was shown to meet criticality safety requirements for a range of operational and accident scenarios. From an institutional perspective, a hybrid organizational structure drawing on rganizational features of the United Nations Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency is proposed as a model for system participation and governance. For political and nonproliferation reasons, a multiple-site arrangement for the IPSS is recommended. The following locations are identified as potential IPSS sites: Savannah River (U. S.), Mayak (Russia), La Hague (France), and Rokkasho (Japan). A set of rules governing material ownership and release conditions is also proposed. Intrinsic barriers to the proliferation of plutonium of the type envisioned by the "spent fuel standard" will not be achieved for many years. In the meantime, primary reliance must be placed on extrinsic barriers. (cont.) The effectiveness of an IPSS would derive mainly from the extrinsic (institutional) barriers to proliferation it would provide. An IPSS would significantly enhance the proliferation resistance of global plutonium inventories. Several hurdles to IPSS implementation are identified, and a proposal for implementing the IPSS in Russia is described. The total life-cycle cost of an IPSS is estimated at $ 9 billion (in 2000 dollars). The cost to the U. S. of addressing the excess military plutonium problem with an IPSS strategy is estimated at $ 2. 9 billion, or $ 4. 2 billion if the U. S. covers Russian costs as well. Several financing options are identified. A lifetime-levelized plutonium <b>storage</b> <b>fee</b> of ~$ 900 /kg-year would be sufficient to recover the full life-cycle cost of the IPSS. by Eugene Bae. Thesis (Ph. D.)
