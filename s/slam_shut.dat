25|$|Like their sarcopterygian ancestors, the labyrinthodonts were carnivorous. The rather broad, flat {{skulls and}} hence short jaw muscle would however {{not allow them}} to open their mouth to any great extent. Likely the {{majority}} of them would employ a sit-and-wait strategy, similar to that of many modern amphibians. When suitable prey swam or walked within reach, the jaw would <b>slam</b> <b>shut,</b> the palatine tusks stabbing the hapless victim. The strain put on the teeth by this mode of feeding may have been the reason for the reinforcing labyrinthodont enamel typifying the group. Swallowing was done by tipping the head back, as seen in many modern amphibians and in crocodiles.|$|E
25|$|One incident, {{which took}} place in June 1873 on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, {{involved}} the boat the Henry C. Flagg and its drunk captain. That boat was already leaking; the crew, having partially pumped the water out, entered Lock 74, moving in front of another boat. Because they failed to snub the boat, it crashed into and knocked out the downstream gates. The outrush of water from the lock caused the upstream gates to <b>slam</b> <b>shut,</b> breaking them also, and sending a cascade of water over the boat, sinking it. This suspended navigation on the canal for 48 hours until the lock gates could be replaced and the boat removed from the lock.|$|E
2500|$|Amnesty International {{said that}} the Act [...] "contravenes human rights principles." [...] and an {{editorial}} in The New York Times described the Act as [...] "a tyrannical law that will be ranked with the low points in American democracy, our generation's version of the Alien and Sedition Acts," [...] while American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Anthony D. Romero said, [...] "The president can now, {{with the approval of}} Congress, indefinitely hold people without charge, take away protections against horrific abuse, put people on trial based on hearsay evidence, authorize trials that can sentence people to death based on testimony literally beaten out of witnesses, and <b>slam</b> <b>shut</b> the courthouse door for habeas petitions." ...|$|E

2500|$|Emery {{attempts}} {{to convince the}} others that they should all leave. They refuse, and Emery tries to depart on his own. As he does so, he runs into the ghosts of Pam Asbury and Deanna Petrie (Yvonne Sciò), the movie star who vanished in {{the house in the}} 1940s. Emery has the power to make apparitions disappear by repeating the phrase [...] "not there," [...] and avoids the deadly fate of his mother and Dr. Miller. As Emery is about to leave Rose Red, Annie Wheaton wakes and via psychokinesis causes the doors of Rose Red to <b>slam</b> <b>shut.</b> Emery's hand is caught in the door, and some of his fingers are severed. While the others assist Emery, Joyce Reardon asks Annie to continue to keep the doors and windows sealed, promising to give her the dollhouse if she does so. However, Steve soon discovers that he is able to communicate with Annie telepathically, and she begins to form a friendship with him.|$|E
2500|$|On one occasion, as Stephen was mopping {{the kitchen}} floor with a cloth, Rose accidentally stepped into the bowl of water he had been using to perform this task. In response, Rose smashed the boy {{over the head with}} the bowl, then {{repeatedly}} kicked him in the head and chest as she shouted: [...] "You did that on purpose, you little swine!" [...] On another occasion, Rose became hysterical at a missing kitchen utensil, then grabbed a knife she had been using to cut a slab of meat, repeatedly inflicting light scour marks to Mae's chest until her rib cage was covered with light knife wounds. All the while, Mae had screamed, [...] "No, Mum! No, Mum!" [...] as Stephen and Heather stood by, helplessly sobbing. Even Fred occasionally became the recipient of Rose's violence. On one occasion in the late 1970s, Rose chased after Fred with a carving knife in her hand, although Fred was able to <b>slam</b> <b>shut</b> the door of the room into which he had run as Rose plunged at him with the knife, resulting in the knife embedding itself in the door, and Rose's fingers sliding down the blade, almost severing them from her hand. In response, Rose calmly wrapped her hand in a towel and said: [...] "Look what you done, fella. You've got {{to take me to the}} hospital now." ...|$|E

60|$|So, {{going to}} the first door, he opened it and ventured slowly into the dimly lighted corridor. When he had {{advanced}} a few steps he heard {{the door of his}} room <b>slam</b> <b>shut</b> behind him. He ran back at once, but the door of rock fitted so closely into the wall that he found it impossible to open it again. That did not matter so much, however, for the room was a prison and the only way of escape seemed ahead of him.|$|E
60|$|At {{once the}} door swung open, its great hinges making a groaning sound as if in protest, so Woot leaped down and {{followed}} his companions into a big, bare hallway. Scarcely were the three inside, however, {{when they heard the}} door <b>slam</b> <b>shut</b> behind them, and this astonished them because no one had touched it. It had closed of its own accord, as if by magic. Moreover, the latch was on the outside, and the thought occurred to each one of them that they were now prisoners in this unknown castle.|$|E

50|$|A dashpot is {{a common}} {{component}} in a door closer {{to prevent it from}} <b>slamming</b> <b>shut.</b> A spring applies force to close the door, and the dashpot forces fluid to flow through an orifice between reservoirs (the orifice is often adjustable), which slows the motion of the door.|$|R

5000|$|This has {{not always}} been viewed kindly. For example, Vladimir Nabokov in his Notes on Prosody says: [...] "In my casual perusals, I have of course <b>slammed</b> <b>shut</b> without further ado any such works on English prosody in which I glimpsed a crop of musical notes." [...] (pages 3 - 4) ...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of pulsejets. The first {{is known as a}} valved or {{traditional}} pulsejet and it has a set of one-way valves through which the incoming air passes. When the air-fuel is ignited, these valves <b>slam</b> <b>shut</b> which means that the hot gases can only leave through the engine's tailpipe, thus creating forward thrust.|$|E
5000|$|Cinderella and the Prince marry {{under the}} {{approving}} eye of King Maximilian and Queen Constantina, as {{the gates of}} the palace <b>slam</b> <b>shut</b> on Cinderella's stepfamily; left outside as the Prince and his new Princess start their lives together.

50|$|Rather than {{providing}} an accurate representation of reality, the game's sound effects reflect {{an attempt to}} make the game more exciting by exaggerating the impact force of punches. In particular, the effects for hard punches sound extremely forceful, being more reminiscent of a car door being <b>slammed</b> <b>shut</b> than boxing-glove covered fists impacting with another person.|$|R

5000|$|According to the New York Times, Meissner's {{appointment}} was viewed favorably {{because of her}} knowledge of the domain acquired through years of experience under both Democratic and Republican administrations, {{as well as the}} non-political nature of the appointment.

50|$|The {{doors were}} {{extremely}} heavy, and when opening them great care {{had to be}} taken that the latch engaged the top of the door.

All one had to do to close the door was hit the pad and the door would <b>slam</b> <b>shut.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Modern snorkel {{induction}} masts use a fail-safe design using compressed air, {{controlled by}} a simple electrical circuit, to hold the [...] "head valve" [...] open against the pull of a powerful spring. Seawater washing over the mast shorts out exposed electrodes on top, breaking the control circuit. This vents the compressed air and allows the head valve to <b>slam</b> <b>shut.</b> When the electrodes are again clear of the water, the circuit is re-energized and the valve reopens.|$|E
