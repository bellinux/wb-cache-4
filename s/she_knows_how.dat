5|$|In {{the present}} day, Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) gives Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) {{an offer to}} become his deputy. Later, Regina (Lana Parrilla) tells Emma that {{she is no longer}} afraid of her staying in the town, and cites Emma's mobile lifestyle. Emma {{encounters}} a 19-year-old pregnant maid named Ashley Boyd (Schram), crying about not having a future for both her and her baby. Emma tells Ashley that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> it feels to have a baby at a young age. She encourages Ashley to take charge and change her life. Later that evening, Ashley breaks into Mr. Gold's pawn shop and steals a contract from a safe. While there, she is confronted by Mr. Gold, who attempts to stop her. Ashley attacks him, leaving him unconscious on the floor of his shop.|$|E
5|$|Athena reappears, {{demanding}} that Kratos return {{what she thinks}} he took from Pandora's Box. She refuses to believe the box was empty, explaining that when Zeus sealed the evils {{of the world in}} the box, she placed her power of hope in it, foreseeing that it would eventually be opened. Athena realizes that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and infected the gods while Kratos was imbued with hope, which enabled him to kill Ares. She tells Kratos to return her power, saying that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to use it to rebuild the world. Distrusting Athena and tired of being used as a pawn, Kratos refuses; saying his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope for the world so that it can heal. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has disappointed her and leaves empty-handed. Near death, Kratos collapses as Athena leaves.|$|E
25|$|In Coffee {{a picture}} of utter destitution is drawn. Like the story A Little Blade of Grass this story also deals with master-servant relations, but the elderly woman who {{is the focus of}} this story doesn't live in the master's house and consume his food. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to defer to the wealth and status of the wealthy neighbors that {{surround}} her and cater to their every need, but it does her little good in the end.|$|E

25|$|When Peggy awakes, {{she finds}} herself back {{in the spring of}} 1960, her senior year of high school, after she passed out after {{donating}} blood in the school gym (where the reunion was). She finds all of her friends that she just left to also be their teenage selves, not just her. Still in shock, she allows herself to be taken home while she sees her surroundings are the way they were 25 years before. After a rough first night, she decides to have fun with the experience and behave as if everything is normal. However, when given the chance to break up with Charlie, she thinks it might be best since <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> it will end.|$|E
25|$|As {{the story}} {{continues}} {{from the previous}} episode, Emma sees the woman across from her in the cell as the same woman who was arrested for helping Snow, and learns that they are both due to be executed immediately the next day. Using her tricks from the night Neal broke into the amusement park, Emma remembers <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to break a lock by using two spoons, and it works. Later on, Charming catches Snow in the rope trap, although the timeline of their introduction is thrown off, until Hook shows up to say that another woman (Emma) has his ring. Charming looks at Snow's fairy dust pendant while she tells him her backstory (another timeline that was thrown off), and {{comes up with a}} plan to break into Regina’s castle first, then rescue Emma and steal back the ring. Snow tells them to wait, which gives Hook and Charming time to talk about love. Moments later, Red Riding Hood shows up, revealing herself as a friend of Snow's, and who can get them into the castle. As they reach the place, Red, who transformed into a wolf, scares a guard into running away, but the escape plan goes awry when they run into Emma and her fellow inmate, prompting Hook to tell Emma that she deprived him of a dashing rescue. Seconds later, Snow and Regina prepare to face off, with Snow throwing her dark fairy dust, but Regina uses her magic to stop it in midair. Snow tries telling her that what happened to Daniel (when she told Cora) was a mistake, saying that she was only a child, but an unforgiving Regina talks about consequences and sets up a stake to burn her. Regina throws a fireball at the helpless Snow White, who appears to die. Her death causes Red to howl as a wolf and Emma to cry over her mother's death.|$|E
25|$|Mia visits Peyton, and Peyton is {{concerned}} that Mia is not focused on her work. She suggests to Mia that she listen to a CD of songs she could possibly sing. They clash because Mia writes all of her own songs. Eventually, Peyton gives up on Mia and asks her to leave the label. Meanwhile, Peyton deals with stomach pains. She sees a doctor about it, and tells the doctor about Ellie's cancer. Her tearful face after the phone call predicts trouble ahead. Peyton later finds out {{that she does not}} have cancer, but is actually pregnant. She tells Lucas first, and Haley finds out in her own time, but Peyton seems hesitant to share her news with Brooke because <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> much Brooke has wanted a family. Peyton eventually tells Brooke, and Brooke is happy for her. Peyton has her first ultrasound, but is upset because she thinks that Lucas is too busy to come and has forgotten. Lucas surprises her by coming, and the two get to hear their baby's heartbeat for the first time. Later, Lucas and Peyton learn that Peyton has placenta praevia and that having this baby could mean the end of Peyton's life. Lucas, afraid of losing her and raising a child that has to go through the same motherless state Peyton did, tries to guilt her into an abortion. They get past this and decide to have the baby. Lucas tells her that he wants to get married to her sooner, not because she might die beforehand, but because he loves her, and wants her to be his wife. Lucas and Peyton get married at the lake where they met. Haley is the minister. After the reception, Lucas and Peyton go home and Peyton collapses on the floor while waiting for Lucas's surprise. Lucas walks in the house and finds Peyton unconscious on the floor in a pool of blood. Peyton is rushed to the hospital by a blood-covered Lucas, who begs her not to leave him. Peyton goes through an emergency caesarean section, and falls into a coma. The caesarean section is successful and she has a daughter named Sawyer Brooke Scott. She later awakes with Lucas and Brooke by her side. Karen brings in Sawyer, and Nathan, Haley, Jamie and Julian join them. Dan visits Peyton and she, after some hesitation, allows Dan to hold Sawyer. She and Lucas then leave Tree Hill.|$|E

500|$|During an interview, {{executive}} producer Susan Bower explained that Natasha is [...] "a teenage troublemaker who is actually really, really clever". Natasha {{wants to be}} a famous model, she loves to gossip and <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to get the boy's attentions. Bower also added that Natasha and Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) clash because Summer is a feminist who fights for causes, while Natasha is the opposite. Novakovic is fond of the love-hate relationship Natasha shares with Summer and said that they were [...] "frenemies." [...] She further explained, [...] "They're in the same social group at school, {{and despite the fact that}} they have so many differences, they're similar in a lot of ways. And Summer is Natasha's only female friend, don't forget." ...|$|E
500|$|The gentlemanly {{and popular}} Captain Corcoran greets his [...] "gallant crew" [...] and {{compliments}} {{them on their}} politeness, saying that he returns the favour by never ("well, hardly ever") using bad language, such as [...] "a big, big D". After the sailors leave, the Captain confesses to Little Buttercup that Josephine is reluctant to consider a marriage proposal from Sir Joseph Porter, the First Lord of the Admiralty. Buttercup says that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> it feels to love in vain. As she leaves, the Captain remarks that she is [...] "a plump and pleasing person". Josephine enters and reveals to her father that she loves a humble sailor in his crew, but she assures him {{that she is a}} dutiful daughter and will never reveal her love to this sailor.|$|E

500|$|Series co-creator and {{executive}} producer Weiss praised Clarke's portrayal in the scene saying [...] "Emilia absolutely crushed it. It's one of those weird scenes because it was half shot in Spain, half in Belfast. But largely due to her performance, it works brilliantly." [...] Sackheim, {{the director of the}} episode, noted in an interview, [...] "With the interior, {{there was only one way}} for her to play it, which is, bemused. She's the keeper of the secret. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to extricate herself from this. I thought the ease with which she delivered the lines was necessary for the audience to feel jeopardy for her and for them to think she was crazy. The sequence outside was all about claiming the throne — or reclaiming the throne." [...] Sackheim also stated, [...] "We wanted to clearly distinguish everything we've seen from the end of the last season and the beginning of this one." ...|$|E
500|$|Homer gets Lurleen a gig on {{a country}} western {{television}} series called Ya-Hoo! Just before her performance, Homer and Lurleen {{spend the night in}} her mobile home, and she shows him one of her new songs. In the song she asks Homer to [...] "bunk" [...] with her, but Homer knows that would violate his marital vows and leaves. During her performance, Homer is approached by a business agent who asks to buy Lurleen's contract, but Homer refuses. In Lurleen's dressing room, Homer becomes locked in an embrace with her, then describes how his love life is flashing before his eyes. Homer tells Lurleen that he only wanted to share her voice with the world and leaves before he does anything to lose his family. He again runs into the agent and this time sells Lurleen's contract for US $50. At home, Marge is watching the Ya-Hoo! show when Homer returns. When Homer gets into bed, Marge hears what Homer did through Lurleen's bluesy song on the television which Lurleen concludes by saying <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> lucky Marge is.|$|E
500|$|Abi {{has been}} {{described}} by the official EastEnders website as the family's [...] "golden girl" [...] compared to Lauren, hinting that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to get her own way. She {{has been described}} as [...] "bubbly" [...] and [...] "self-assured" [...] with a nose for mischief. She has also been described as having the biggest heart in Walford, bringing out the best in the people around her. Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror said that Abi is a [...] "real soft touch". Jon Wise from The People said that after Abi received a makeover in 2010, she [...] "actually turned out to be quite pretty". In 2012, Fitzgerald told Inside Soap Laura-Jane Tyler that Abi has grown up in her first six years on screen, and is now sensible, [...] "like a [...] " [...] and has had to mature quickly because of the dramatic situations she has been involved in. Tyler added that Abi is the most level-headed and sensible member of the Branning family and [...] "puts her [...] to shame with her mature approach to [...]" ...|$|E

She also pioneered the use of pseudo-science in marketing, donning a lab coat in many advertisements, despite the fact that her only training had been a two-month tour of European skin-care facilities. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to manipulate consumers' status anxiety, as well: If a product faltered initially, she would hike the price to raise the perceived value." ...|$|R
500|$|When Carter goes {{undercover}} in the episode, {{she wears}} a dress inspired by the evening dresses of the 1930s and 40s, which the script described as a [...] "Veronica Lake look". Ottobre-Melton noted that [...] "We got to make Peggy into the classic femme fatale". For the character of Colleen O'Brien, series costume designer Giovanna Ottobre-Melton saw her as [...] "a hard working girl making just enough to get by. The war term 'Mend and Make Do' really applies to her. She has a few nice pieces in her closet that she scrimped and saved to buy. My guess is <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to unravel an old tired sweater to knit herself a new one." [...] The man in the green suit [...] "wore a suit that was a tricky balance," [...] explained Ottobre-Melton. [...] "The goal {{was to find a}} green that wasn't over the top, but still made a powerful statement. The suit I designed was inspired by a 1940s green double breasted suit I had located." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{critics have}} called The Good Terrorists title an oxymoron. Robert Boschman {{suggested}} it {{is indicative of}} Alice's [...] "contradictory personality" [...] – she renovates the squat's house, yet is bent on destroying society. In The Hudson Review, George Kearns wrote that the title [...] "hovers above the novel with... irony". The reader assumes that Alice is the [...] "good terrorist", but that while {{she may be a}} good person, she is [...] "rotten at being a terrorist". Writing in World Literature Today, Mona Knapp concluded that Lessing's heroine, the [...] "good terrorist", is neither a good person, nor a good revolutionary. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to renovate houses and manipulate people to her advantage, but she is unemployed and steals money from her parents. When real revolutionaries start using the squat to ship arms, she panics and, going behind her comrades' backs, makes a telephone call to the authorities to warn them. Knapp called Alice [...] "a bad terrorist and a stunted human being". Fishburn suggested that it is Lessing herself who is the [...] "good terrorist", symbolised here by Alice, but that hers is [...] "political terrorism of a literary kind", where she frequently disguises her ideas in [...] "very domestic-looking fiction", and [...] "direct challenge... our sense of reality".|$|E
500|$|Amy Phillips of Pitchfork Media commended Gaga's {{performance}} {{saying that}} it was [...] "amazing as usual– a master class in over-the-top theatrics, campy gender-bending, and cheeky fun... But it was almost beside the point. The whole Gaga machine, the whole Gaga world we were immersed in– that was the point. It was overwhelming, all consuming. Something even the best album promo cycles only dream of being." [...] Phillips wondered how Gaga would be able to [...] "top" [...] the ArtRave event and listed it as an unprecedented promotional tool for an artist's album release cycle. Billboard Andrew Hampp and Jason Lipshutz compared Gaga's outfit to a [...] "bizarro" [...] version of Jack Box, the mascot for Jack in the Box, and wrote that the lip-synched portion of her performance was [...] "more pop art than artistic pop music." [...] Hampp and Lipshutz summarized their experience by writing, [...] "Even if the 'ARTPOP' live show still needs a bit of tinkering to fully captivate, Lady Gaga showed on Sunday night that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to meld low art and high art at a party." [...] Michael Baggs of Gigwise described the concert as [...] "sparse but impressive" [...] and wrote that Gaga appeared [...] "wide-eyed and slightly manic... but impressed with live vocals and a hugely energetic performance." ...|$|E

500|$|The song mainly {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, with some noting it as a standout on the album. Don Shewey of Rolling Stone commented [...] "Although it's awfully {{reminiscent of the}} Pointer Sisters' 'He's So Shy', 'How Will I Know' is still irresistibly danceable." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote [...] "...what really impresses some 20-plus years on are the lighter tracks, particularly the breakthrough single 'How Will I Know'." [...] While listing Houston's top five songs of the 1980s, Steve Peake of About.com gave the song a positive review, writing, [...] "Houston's boppy, peppy numbers tend to suffer from a particularly dated sound compared to her ballads, but this song still works remarkably well because of its lush melody throughout the verse, bridge and chorus." [...] "his track helps Houston prove that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to interpret, with great skill, tunes that display solid craftsmanship," [...] he added. While reviewing the Deluxe Anniversary Edition of the album, Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly commented on the a cappella version of the song noting, [...] "a cappella mix of 'How Will I Know' [...] displays the singer's precision long {{before the advent of}} Auto-Tune." [...] While reviewing The Ultimate Collection, Nick Levine of Digital Spy added, [...] "Houston's floor-fillers have aged a little more gracefully, although their clunky, thudding drum sounds are as unmistakably eighties as Joan Collins' Dynasty wardrobe." [...] The song was voted number twelve in VH1's List of Greatest Songs of the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|When the Carter family {{begin to}} {{struggle}} financially, Babe decides to help by selling alcohol before the allocated hours, despite it breaching The Vic's licensing laws. Badland explained that Babe [...] "deals with {{things in the}} way that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> but it doesn't always work out the way that she wants it to". Badland described Babe's actions as [...] "instinctive", which makes her [...] "often [...] on impulse". She questioned whether Babe could be [...] "an optimist and doesn't fully consider the damage she can cause." [...] Kathy Beale (Taylforth) decides to tip the authorities and after a series of undercover investigations, the police arrest Babe, Mick and Shirley. In her interview, Babe blames Mick and tells the police she was [...] "only acting on instructions". Despite this, they all spend the night in police custody. Badland revealed that Babe [...] "was assuming she could {{find a way out of}} it" [...] when blaming Mick because [...] "it's about staying alive in that moment." [...] She explained that Babe's actions stem from a fear of being arrested and said, [...] "For all she has ever been up to, she has never been in a prison cell so it was about her staying afloat in that precise moment." [...] Badland believed that Babe would be able to [...] "talk her way out of trouble with the Carters" [...] again and explained that [...] "the family have a lot to talk about – and a lot to find out about..." ...|$|E
500|$|... "What'd I Say" [...] {{was banned}} by many {{black and white}} radio {{stations}} because of, as one critic noted, [...] "the dialogue between himself and his backing singers that started in church {{and ended up in}} the bedroom". The erotic nature was obvious to listeners, but a deeper aspect of the fusion between black gospel music and R troubled many black audiences. Music, as was much of American society, was also segregated, and some critics complained that gospel was not only being appropriated by secular musicians, but it was being marketed to white listeners. During several concerts in the 1960s, the crowds became so frenetic and the shows so resembled revival meetings while Charles performed [...] "What'd I Say" [...] that the police were called in, when the organizers became worried that riots might break out. The moral controversy surrounding the song has been attributed to its popularity; Charles later acknowledged in an interview that the beat was catchy, but it was the suggestive lyrics that attracted listeners: [...] "'See the girl with the diamond ring. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to shake that thing.' It wasn't the diamond ring that got 'em." [...] "What'd I Say" [...] was Ray Charles' first crossover hit into the growing genre of rock and roll. He seized the opportunity of his immense newfound success and announced to Ertegun and Wexler that he was considering signing with ABC-Paramount Records (later renamed ABC Records) later in 1959. While he was in negotiations with ABC-Paramount, Atlantic Records released an album of his hits, titled What'd I Say.|$|E
