2500|$|The Series II Land Rover was a sales success, {{but there}} was still room for improvements. In 1962 the {{slightly}} altered Series IIA was launched. As well as some suspension and steering system changes, the biggest update was an improved diesel engine. This shared many parts with its petrol-fuelled sibling, including the block, valve gear, cooling systems and lubrication systems. A forged crankshaft was used for added strength, and different pistons were needed. The cylinder head used the same basic casting, but was very different internally, being in essence an updated version of that used on the original 2-litre engine, to which the new diesel bore a strong external resemblance. Like the 2.25-litre petrol, the 2.25-litre diesel was a dry-liner design. It was built on the same production line as the petrol engine and the flexibility of the basic design was much in evidence- for example, where the diesel engines had their fuel injector pumps, the petrol engine had its distributor fitted. Although it offered a modest improvement in power and a useful jump in torque, the main benefit of the new diesel engine was that it was much quieter and more efficient than the older unit. It also proved to be much more reliable in service. Like the petrol engine, the diesel was upgraded to a 5-bearing crankshaft in 1980. The engine was fitted to the Austin FX4 Black Cab between 1982 and 1985. FX4s fitted with the engine were designated 'FX4R' ('R' for 'Rover'). In this application the engine gained a reputation for very short service life and unreliability. This was caused by the significantly greater times spent at idle speed in the Black Cab than in the Land Rover. Solihull engineers had warned Carbodies, builders of the FX4R that this would cause problems as at idle speed the engine's oil pressure dropped, causing the automatic tensioner unit for the timing chain to not operate fully. At the high number of hours spent at idle speed (taxi drivers tended to leave the engines idling for long period whilst waiting for passengers or when off-duty as well as all the time spent in <b>stationary</b> <b>traffic</b> in London) this caused the timing chains to stretch, causing incorrect fuel injection timing which greatly reduced engine life. [...] The 10J engine was also adapted into a marine engine by Mercury of the USA and sold under the Mercruiser 165 name.|$|E

Comments can be posted through CCR Online. The available bandwidth of a path directly impacts the performance of throughput sensitive applications, e. g., p 2 p content replication or podcasting. Several tools have been devised to estimate the available bandwidth. The vast majority of these tools follow either the Probe Rate Model (PRM) or the Probe Gap Model (PGM). Lao et al. [6] and Liu et al. [7] have identified biases in the PGM approach that lead to consistent underestimations of the available bandwidth. Those results were obtained under the ideal assumption of <b>stationary</b> cross <b>traffic.</b> In this note, we confirm {{the existence of these}} biases experimentally, i. e., for the case of non <b>stationary</b> cross <b>traffic.</b> To do so, we compare one representative of the PRM family, namely Pathload, and one representative of the PGM family, namely Spruce, using long term (several day long) traces collected on an example path. We first propose a methodology to compare operational results of two available bandwidth measurement tools. Based on the sanitized data obtained using the previous methodology, we next show that the biases identified by previous works are clearly observable on the long term, even with non <b>stationary</b> cross <b>traffic.</b> We further uncover the formal link that exists between the work by Liu et al. and the one by Lao et al...|$|R

The connectivity of the server to each queue is randomly modulated, taking values 1 (connected) or 0 (severed). At any given time, only the currently connected queues may receive service. A key issue is how to schedule the server on the connected queues {{in order to maximize}} the system throughput. We investigate the behavior of two dynamic schedules, when the loading of the system exceeds its capacity. It is shown that unlike many other queueing systems that exhibit a binary behavior-global stability or global instability- the system under consideration exhibits a much richer behavior, with several partial stability modes. These modes are fully determined by the underlying traffic loading. The results are obtained under very general <b>stationary</b> ergodic <b>traffic</b> flows and connectivity modulation. I...|$|R
5000|$|One {{solution}} is to place speed restrictions on curved sections of track; another is to bank the railbed on the curve, with the outer rail higher than the inner rail so the net force passes straight through {{the floor of the}} coach. Banking the track is known as [...] "cant" [...] or superelevation. These measures were gradually adopted on the railways between 1835 and 1860. The use of track cant can only be applied where the speed of the train is fixed in advance. Slower, or <b>stationary,</b> <b>traffic</b> sharing the same line will experience forces pulling inwards, and, conversely, faster traffic will still experience forces pulling outwards. Long experience has shown that, to avoid discomfort on slower trains, track cant should not exceed 6°; and, for trains moving more quickly, cant deficiency should not exceed 4.5°.|$|E

5000|$|Traffic on {{a stretch}} of road {{is said to be}} {{stationary}} if an observer does not detect movement in an arbitrary area of the time-space diagram. Traffic is stationary if all the vehicle trajectories are parallel and equidistant. It is also stationary if it is a superposition of families of trajectories with these properties (e.g. fast and slow drivers). By using a very small hole in the template one could sometimes view an empty region of the diagram and other times not, so that even in these cases, one could say that traffic was not stationary. Clearly, for such fine level of observation, <b>stationary</b> <b>traffic</b> does not exist. A microscopic level of observation must be excluded from the definition if traffic appears to be similar through larger windows. In fact, we relax the definition even further by only requiring that the quantities t(A) and d(A) be approximately the same, regardless of where the [...] "large" [...] window (A) is placed.|$|E

40|$|Occupancies {{and flows}} were jointly sampled from {{numerous}} freeway segments in nearly <b>stationary,</b> unqueued <b>traffic.</b> The data from one segment were typically averaged across all lanes there and plotted. Each plot was compared with one sampled at a neighboring freeway segment, {{with the two}} segments differing only in their number of travel lanes. Such comparisons were repeated {{for a total of}} five pairs of segments on five freeways in and near Toronto, Canada and in California. All occupancy-flow relations were piece-wise linear in form for average flows up to about 2, 000 vehicles per hour per lane. Only when traffic became moderately dense did average vehicle speeds diminish with increasing occupancies. The occupancy above which these speed diminutions occurred was the same for both segments in a pair. Notable, however, the average vehicle speed corresponding to a given occupancy was always higher on the segment with the larger number of lanes. The driver psychology that can explain some of these findings is discussed. Findings are also contrasted with information currently provided in traffic handbooks...|$|R

At each node u, for every other node t, the algorithm independently and iteratively updates the fraction of traffic destined to t that leaves u on each of its outgoing links. At each iteration, the updates are calculated based on the shortest path to each destination {{as determined by the}} marginal costs of the network’s links. The marginal link costs used to find the shortest paths are in turn obtained from link-state updates that are flooded through the network after each iteration. For <b>stationary</b> input <b>traffic,</b> we prove that HALO converges to the routing assignment that minimizes the cost of the network. Furthermore, we observe that our technique is adaptive, automatically converging to the new optimal routing assignment for quasi-static network changes [2].
