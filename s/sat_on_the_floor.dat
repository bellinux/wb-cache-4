25|$|Meshuchrarim, a {{group of}} freed slaves and their {{descendants}} brought by the Sepahardim, they had no communal rights and no synagogue of their own. They <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> or on the steps outside. In {{the first half of}} the 20th century, Abraham Barak Salem, a meshuchrar, successfully campaigned against this discrimination.|$|E
25|$|The first milking {{machines}} were {{an extension of}} the traditional milking pail. The early milker device fit on top of a regular milk pail and <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> under the cow. Following each cow being milked, the bucket would be dumped into a holding tank. These were introduced in the early 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|People also <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> of synagogues {{instead of}} sitting on chairs, {{similar to the way}} many other non-Ashkenazi Jews sat in synagogues. This is in {{accordance}} with what Rambam (Maimonides) wrote in his Mishneh Torah: ...|$|R

25|$|Instead {{of using}} furniture, they <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> which {{was covered with}} two layers of mats, one of rush, the other of a water plant with long sword shaped leaves (Iris pseudacorus); and for beds they spread planks, hanging mats around them on poles, and {{employing}} skins for coverlets. The men used chopsticks when eating; the women had wooden spoons. Ainu cuisine is not commonly eaten outside Ainu communities; {{there are only a}} few Ainu-run restaurants in Japan, all located in Tokyo or Hokkaido, serving primarily Japanese fare.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{ended the}} subcontinental {{part of the}} tour with victory over Ceylon by an innings and 44 runs. Not wanting to wait {{a month for the}} next boat and a fortnight's sea voyage, the Australians {{returned}} to Perth by hitching a ride on a B-24 Liberator. The pilot of the RAAF plane had already promised 14 friends a lift so {{that they would not be}} stuck in India for another six months, so the Australian team <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the aircraft. They made it back to Australia despite suffering engine trouble and an overloaded plane.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{delegation}} {{did not bring}} the expected number of captives, the members {{were taken to the}} local jail. The talks were held at the Council House, a one-story stone building adjoining the jail on the corner of Main Plaza and Calabosa (Market) Street. During the council, the Comanche warriors <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> as was their custom, while the Texians sat on chairs on a platform facing them. Lockhart had informed the Texians that she had seen 15 other prisoners at the Comanches' principal camp several days before. She maintained that the Indians had wanted to see how high a price they could get for her, and that they then planned to bring in the remaining captives one at a time.|$|E

25|$|On November 14, 2006, Mostafa Tabatabainejad, a fourth-year University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) student, was drive stunned {{multiple}} {{times with a}} Taser by campus police, for allegedly refusing to show his school ID to a fellow student acting as security at the college library Instructional Computing Commons (CLICC) lab at Powell Library during finals week. The police had been called after Tabatabainejad had refused to provide his BruinCard (student ID) to a UCLA Community Service Officer (aka student volunteer). Tabatabainejad felt he was being singled out because of his Middle Eastern ethnicity. A UCLA ID card with magnetic strip is needed {{to enter into the}} Library after hours and therefore it was assumed that all individuals in the library were students and had valid ID cards to gain access. Asking students to show ID was not a common practice and for this reason the student refused to show his ID and instead asked the community officer if he had asked anyone else that evening to show their ID. The community officer threatened to call campus police if he didn't show ID. Tabatabainejad, being confident the campus police would take his side as he felt he was being harassed, invited the community officer to do so. When the campus police arrived they did not ask questions but instead handcuffed Tabatabainejad and attempted to physically remove him from the Library. Tabatabainejad <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> in protest of the way he was being treated at his own University while he was studying for final exams. The campus police then Tasered him five times while his hands were bound behind his back with plastic wrist restraints. Part of the incident was recorded on video by a camera phone and is available for viewing on YouTube.|$|E
500|$|Entirely amateur, {{the team}} mostly {{comprised}} players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the Air Force of Zimbabwe. Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer Duncan Fletcher. Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee {{who had played}} for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor. The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital Lusaka and then to Luanda in Angola, from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. [...] "The stench was terrible", Grant later said. [...] "There were no seats, so we all <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes {{to play on the}} artificial hockey surface." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} match against India, the Australians were 2/250 in {{response}} to India's 386 when Miller came in and hit Vinoo Mankad for four sixes from five balls, before falling to the said bowler for 82. The match ended in a draw, with Miller not taking a wicket after aggravating an injury. Captaining the team, Miller took 3/19 and 1/8 in a match against South Zone in Madras, the Australians' only win on Indian soil. However, he {{had a difficult time}} with the bat, falling twice to Ghulam Ahmed for a duck and eight. He failed with the bat in the third and final match against India, falling twice to Shute Banerjee for two and seven, but he took 2/60 in the first innings as India took the series 10. Miller had a disappointing series in the international matches, with 107 runs at 26.25 and four wickets at 40.50. Australia's final match was in Colombo against an All Ceylon team. [...] Miller scored 132 and took 2/37 as Australia won by an innings. Not wanting to wait a month for the next boat and a fortnight's sea voyage, the Australians returned to Perth by hitching a ride on a B-24 Liberator. The pilot of the RAAF plane had already promised 14 friends a lift so {{that they would not be}} stuck in India for another six months, so the Australian team <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the aircraft.

50|$|The {{first game}} was on January 3, 1962 when the Hokies played Alabama. The Hokies won 91-67. Unfortunately, <b>the</b> crowd <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{concrete}} <b>floor</b> to watch <b>the</b> game because the seats had not arrived.|$|R
60|$|Flung aside {{now that}} he was pinioned, Leroy <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and looked about him. Near him an elderly man was begging for a cup of water. They greeted the prayer with jeering laughter.|$|R

500|$|A promotional {{music video}} was {{produced}} {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "Fire in My Heart" [...] as a single. The video was directed by Jake & Jim, who also directed the video for the group's subsequent single [...] "Do or Die", and shows the Super Furry Animals waiting to leave Mars having played a concert on the planet. The video begins with Gruff Rhys standing alone on the Martian soil, singing along to the song. A silver, computer generated, spaceship is seen landing behind Rhys. Around one minute into the track the camera pans back to reveal {{the rest of the}} Super Furry Animals sitting down to the left of Rhys. Guitarist Huw Bunford is <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> playing an acoustic guitar {{while the rest of the}} group are sat on three metal seats which are connected together. Two aliens are seen walking from the spacecraft towards the band while drummer Dafydd Ieuan pours some of the Martian sand through his hands. When the aliens arrive, one of them, with a bald head, sunglasses and pointy ears, places his left hand on Rhys's right shoulder. Rhys turns around and looks at the other alien who has one eye in the centre of a large round face and is wearing a blue hoodie. The alien smiles at Rhys who then turns around and looks up to see the Earth in the sky above. Ieuan and keyboardist Cian Ciaran are also shown looking at the Earth before the camera moves behind them to reveal hundreds of aliens stood in front of several minaret-like towers, waving at the group. The band are shown picking up a suitcase and guitar before walking towards the spaceship as the song finishes. The aliens were designed by regular Super Furry Animals collaborator Pete Fowler, who acted as [...] "creative advisor" [...] for the video. According to Rhys the aliens were animated by the same special effects team that worked on [...] Rhys has stated that he considers his performance in the video to be [...] "wooden" [...] as he was forced to take painkillers during the shoot due to a [...] "stiff neck".|$|E

2500|$|It {{was during}} his time with Nanrei that {{he was given the}} name Zeshin, which he would stick with {{for the rest of his}} life. The name has a meaning similar to [...] "this is true" [...] or [...] "the Truth", a {{reference}} to an old Chinese tale of a king who held an audience with a great number of painters. While nearly all of the painters afforded the king the proper respect, bowing before him and comporting themselves appropriately, one arrived half-naked, did not bow, and <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> licking his paintbrush; the king exclaimed [...] "now, this is a true artist!" [...] And from this the name Zeshin was taken.|$|E
50|$|Magda later {{recalled}} {{the significance of}} McHale’s return from his formative visit to America laden with imagery culled from American sources. “We all <b>sat</b> around <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> for hours and looked through this unbelievable trunk of materials,” she said.|$|R
60|$|No {{wonder they}} laughed, for the {{expression}} of his face was droll enough to convulse a Quaker, as he stood and stared wildly from the unconscious innocents to the hilarious spectators with such dismay that Jo <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and screamed.|$|R
60|$|Ruth and Lucille {{immediately}} <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of <b>the</b> piazza {{and the one}} {{emptied the}} board-money into the lap of the other, where it was speedily divided into three equal portions, {{one of which was}} placed in the hands of each mariner.|$|R
2500|$|Anish Kapoor {{became known}} in the 1980s for his {{geometric}} or biomorphic sculptures made using simple materials such as granite, limestone, marble, pigment, and plaster. These early sculptures are frequently simple, curved forms, usually monochromatic and brightly coloured, using powder pigment to define and permeate the form. [...] "While making the pigment pieces, {{it occurred to me}} that they all form themselves out of each other. So I decided to give them a generic title, A Thousand Names, implying infinity, a thousand being a symbolic number. The powder works <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> or projected from the wall. The powder on the floor defines the surface of the floor and the objects appear to be partially submerged, like icebergs. That seems to fit inside the idea of something being partially there." [...] Such use of pigment characterised his first high-profile exhibit as part of the New Sculpture exhibition at the Hayward Gallery London in 1978.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1964, Perkins toured Britain with Chuck Berry. Perkins {{had been}} {{reluctant}} to undertake the tour, convinced that as forgotten {{as he was in}} America, he would be even more obscure in the U.K., and {{he did not want to}} be humiliated by drawing meager audiences. Berry assured him that they had remained much more popular in Britain since the 1950s than they had in the United States and that there would be large crowds of fans at every show. The Animals backed the two performers. On the last night of the tour, Perkins attended a party where he <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> sharing stories, playing guitar, and singing songs while surrounded by the Beatles. Ringo Starr asked if he could record [...] "Honey Don't". Perkins answered, [...] "Man, go ahead, have at it." [...] The Beatles went on to record covers of [...] "Matchbox", [...] "Honey Don't" [...] and [...] "Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby" [...] (recorded by Perkins, adapted from a song originally recorded by Rex Griffin in 1936, with new music by Perkins; a song with the same title was recorded by Roy Newman in 1938). The Beatles recorded two versions of [...] "Glad All Over" [...] in 1963. Another tour to Germany followed in the autumn.|$|E
2500|$|Scaffolders Spratt and Griggs {{were working}} on the morning of Saturday 13 May 1905, and stopped for a tea break. Spratt went home while Edward Henry Griggs {{sheltered}} inside the base of the Tower. One of the hemp strike-weight ropes broke, and the [...] by [...] diameter iron strike weight, weighing about 5 cwt, crashed [...] through two floors and [...] "smashed to a pulp" [...] Griggs' thighs as he <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> drinking his tea. The noise brought the nearby lavatory attendant, who brought a clerk called Wacher, who sent for the doctor Tom Bowes and the Ambulance Corps who took Griggs to the Queen Victoria Memorial Cottage Hospital where he had both legs amputated but died at 11.30am, aged 32 years and leaving a wife and four children. The clock-winder Alfred Smith was an old man, having started this job before 1847. He stopped the clock at 9.45 am and removed the other clock weight. He told the inquest that the hemp ropes were due for replacement and that he had unsuccessfully requested new ropes from the Council, on three occasions during the previous two months. There was a big local funeral on Tuesday 6 May, and the Council started a fund for the relief of the widow. Alfred Smith retired around 1907.|$|E
6000|$|This {{reminded}} the poor {{children of all}} the troubles, about which {{they had come to}} their old friend. Bruno <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and began crying.

6000|$|... "I am dog-tired," [...] he said, and <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> [...] "I went tired this morning, since I came in {{here and}} started talking to you--as tired as if I had been pouring my life-blood here on these planks for you to dabble your white feet in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All yite," [...] {{said the}} little darkey, and she <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> to prepare her child for {{a coat of}} whitewash; but she had not yet succeeded in convincing the doll of the {{importance}} of the operation when her attention was aroused by a dog just outside of the door.|$|R

6000|$|Re-entering the drawing-room, she {{had found}} that Owen had thrust the obnoxious letters into the waste-basket, each unopened envelope, with the contents, rent down the middle.

50|$|During segregation, the {{railroad}} tracks served as a racial divide, with African Americans living to the northeast of the tracks and the whites to the southwest. There were few common public events. When a movie theater was erected in the 1930s, blacks were allowed to access the balcony from a separate entrance. Whites <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main <b>floor.</b>|$|R
