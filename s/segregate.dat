However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists. Ultimately, the genus Isopogon was nomenclaturally conserved over Atylus by the International Botanical Congress of 1905.|$|E

For this purpose a study 			was carried out on the individuals with an Early <b>Segregated</b> and an 			Early Non <b>Segregated</b> Education. 			In order {{to find out the}} Vulnerability to Emotional Problems the 			IPAT Anxiety scale and IPAT Depression scale were administered on a 			sample of 400 individuals within the age range of 20 to 35 years. 			The 400 participants were further divided into four categories 			comprising of 100 females with an Early <b>Segregated</b> educational 			background, 100 males with an Early <b>Segregated</b> educational 			background, 100 females with an Early Non <b>Segregated</b> educational 			background and 100 males with an Early Non <b>Segregated</b> educational 			background. 			Chi square test was computed in order to obtain the statistical 			significance of the data. All the hypotheses were found to be 			statistically significant at 001 level. The findings of the 			present research data provide the evidence that the individuals who 			received an early <b>Segregated</b> education have high anxiety and 			depression sten scores than the individuals who received an early 			Non <b>Segregated</b> education 			Overall, the depression sten scores were found to be higher than the 			anxiety sten scores.

5|$|The {{development}} of molecular phylogenetics, cladistic theory and phylogenetic methods in the 1990s {{resulted in a}} dismemberment of the Liliaceae and its subsequent redistribution across three lilioid orders (Liliales, Asparagales and Dioscoreales). Subsequent work has shown that two other more recently recognized orders, Petrosaviales and Pandanales also <b>segregate</b> with this group, resulting in the modern concept of five constituent orders within the lilioid monocot assemblage. This has resulted in treating monocots as three informal groups, alismatid, lilioid and commelinid monocots. The lilioids are paraphyletic {{in the sense that}} commelinids form a sister group to Asparagales.|$|E
5|$|Pelagic {{stingrays}} may <b>segregate</b> by sex, vertically in {{that males}} {{are found in}} deeper water than females, and perhaps horizontally as well. Captive individuals often act highly aggressively towards ocean sunfish (Mola mola), biting and harassing them, particularly if they are hungry. This species is preyed upon by oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus), great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), toothed whales, and other large, ocean-going carnivores. Its all-around dark coloration likely serves to camouflage it against its featureless habitat. The venom on its tail spine is also quite potent, causing it to be avoided by other fishes. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium benedeni, A. crassicolle, and A. filicolle, Rhinebothrium baeri and R. palombii, and Tetragonocephalum uarnak, and the monogenean Entobdella diadema.|$|E
5|$|Sylvia warblers are {{unusual in}} that they vigorously defend their territories against other members of their genus as well as conspecifics. Blackcaps and garden warblers use {{identical}} habits in the same wood, yet aggressive interactions mean that their territories never overlap. Similar songs are {{a feature of the}} Sylvia warblers as a group, and {{it has been suggested that}} this promotes interspecific competition and helps to <b>segregate</b> territories between related species. It appears more likely from later studies that segregation of sympatric species, other than the blackcap and garden warbler, is due to subtle habitat preferences rather than interspecies aggression.|$|E

5|$|The common {{thresher}} is migratory, {{moving to}} higher latitudes following warm water masses. In the eastern Pacific, males travel further than females, reaching {{as far as}} Vancouver Island {{in the late summer}} and early fall. Juveniles tend to remain in warm nursery areas. There appear to be separate populations with different life history characteristics in the eastern Pacific and western Indian Ocean and possibly elsewhere; this species is not known to make transoceanic movements. In the northwestern Indian Ocean, males and females <b>segregate</b> by location and depth during the pupping season from January to May. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA has revealed substantial regional genetic variation within common threshers in all three oceans. This could support the idea that, despite being high mobile, sharks from different areas rarely interbreed.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{southern}} cities at the time, Chicago did not <b>segregate</b> {{most public}} accommodations. According to Walter Francis White of the NAACP, pre-1915 Chicago {{had a good}} reputation for equitable treatment of African Americans. However, unofficially, early 20th-century Chicago beaches were racially segregated. African Americans {{had a long history}} in Chicago, the city sending its first African-American representative to the state legislature in 1876. However, the black population in 1900 was only about 1 percent, while it expanded dramatically {{in the early years of}} the century. Most Irish Americans and African Americans competed for low-end jobs, causing tension between the groups.|$|E
5|$|Four Albatrellus {{species were}} {{included}} in a large-scale phylogenetic analysis of the order Russulales published in 2003. Based on their ribosomal DNA sequences, the four form a clade, or monophyletic group (that is, they derived from a single ancestor). Of the four tested species, A.ovinus was most closely related to A.subrubescens. The polypore Wrightoporia lenta (type species of the genus Wrightoporia) occurred on a single branch basal to the albatrellus clade, implying that it shared with the Albatrellus species a common ancestor from which both were descended. In a more recent (2010) molecular analysis by Canadian mycologist Serge Audet aimed at clarifying relationships among species formerly placed in Scutiger, A.subrubescens grouped in a clade with A.ovinus and A.citrinus. According to Audet, these species, in addition to A.avellaneus and A.piceiphilus, are the constituents of an Albatrellus with limits defined by molecular genetics. Other Albatrellus species were transferred to <b>segregate</b> genera: A.fletti and A.confluens to Albatrellopsis; A.caeruleoporus and A.yasudae to Neoalbatrellus; A.pes-caprae and A.ellisii to an amended Scutiger.|$|E

In the weakly <b>segregated</b> phase the symmetry of the shape of each condensate will not take that of the trap because of the finite surface tension, but its total density profile still does. In the strongly <b>segregated</b> phase even the total density profile takes a different symmetry from that of the trap because of the mutual exclusion of the condensates. The lower critical condensate-atom number to observe the complete phase segregation is discussed. A comparison to recent experimental data suggests that the weakly <b>segregated</b> phase has been observed. Comment: minor change...|$|R
5|$|In 1239 Henry {{introduced}} different policies, possibly {{trying to}} imitate those of Louis of France: Jewish leaders across England were imprisoned {{and forced to}} pay fines equivalent {{to a third of}} their goods, and any outstanding loans were to be released. Further huge demands for cash followed – £40,000 was demanded in 1244, for example, of which around two-thirds was collected within five years – destroying the ability of the Jewish community to lend money commercially. Henry had built the Domus Conversorum in London in 1232 to help convert Jews to Christianity, and efforts intensified after 1239; as many as 10 percent of the Jews in England had been converted by the late 1250s. Anti-Jewish stories involving tales of child sacrifice flourished in the 1250s and, in response, Henry passed the Statute of Jewry in 1253, which attempted to <b>segregate</b> Jews and enforce the wearing of Jewish badges; it remains unclear to what extent this statute was actually implemented by Henry.|$|E
5|$|This fern was {{at first}} {{identified}} by André Michaux, in 1803, as black spleenwort (Asplenium adiantum-nigrum). Carl Ludwig Willdenow recognized and {{described it as a}} separate species, which he named Asplenium montanum, in 1810. In 1901, John A. Shafer attempted to transfer it to the genus Athyrium as Athyrium montanum, but this name is illegitimate as a later homonym of Athyrium montanum (Lam.) Röhl. ex Spreng. The species was segregated from Asplenium as Chamaefilix montana by Oliver Atkins Farwell in 1931. The change was not widely accepted and current authorities do not recognize this <b>segregate</b> genus. In 1974, Timothy Reeves described an unusual population of A.montanum from the Shawangunk Mountains. Having used chromatography to show {{that it was not a}} hybrid, he interpreted it as a new form, Asplenium montanum forma shawangunkense. In this form, as contrasted with the usual forma montanum, the leaf blade is yellow-green, the fronds continue highly dissected to the apex and do not come to a pointed tip, the fronds are shorter and more highly dissected than usual, and all fronds are sterile.|$|E
5|$|Following the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, {{rather than}} {{governing}} through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily {{in a handful}} of his favourite palaces and castles. He married Eleanor of Provence, with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his piety, holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of Edward the Confessor, whom he adopted as his patron saint. He extracted huge sums of money from the Jews in England, ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the Statute of Jewry, attempting to <b>segregate</b> the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he invaded Poitou in 1242, leading to the disastrous Battle of Taillebourg. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. Henry supported his brother Richard in his bid to become King of the Romans in 1256, but was unable to place his own son Edmund on the throne of Sicily, despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on crusade to the Levant, but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in Gascony.|$|E

5|$|Soil is {{the living}} {{top layer of}} mineral and organic dirt that covers {{the surface of the}} planet. It is the chief {{organizing}} centre of most ecosystem functions, and it is of critical importance in agricultural science and ecology. The decomposition of dead organic matter (for example, leaves on the forest floor), results in soils containing minerals and nutrients that feed into plant production. The whole of the planet's soil ecosystems is called the pedosphere where a large biomass of the Earth's biodiversity organizes into trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves, for example, create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively, these organisms are the detritivores that regulate soil formation. Tree roots, fungi, bacteria, worms, ants, beetles, centipedes, spiders, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other less familiar creatures all work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems. Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called bioturbation. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil microorganisms are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to <b>segregate</b> the biological from geomorphological systems in soils. Paleoecological studies of soils places the origin for bioturbation to a time before the Cambrian period. Other events, such as the evolution of trees and the colonization of land in the Devonian period {{played a significant role in}} the early development of ecological trophism in soils.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly {{recessed}} on August 28 for the Labor Day holiday, and did {{not come}} back into session until September 4. The same day, Governor Stanley conferred with Rep. Smith, Delegate Gray, and House Speaker Moore. Their discussion focused on the Stanley plan's lack of an appeals process for pupil assignments. Stanley agreed to a compromise that would allow an administrative appeal (through an as-yet-to-be-worked-out process), followed by a required appeal to state courts and lower federal courts before any appeal could {{be taken to the}} U.S. Supreme Court. The Stanley plan seemed to suffer a serious blow the following day, however, when the Virginia State Board of Education voted not to endorse the plan. Four members strongly opposed withholding state funds from integrated schools, which led to the negative vote. The board also voted to publicly support the original Gray Commission plan. Meeting with the board after the vote, Governor Stanley discussed the possibility of merging his plan with some sort of pupil assignment plan, so that pupil assignment would be permitted but funds would still be withheld if assignment failed to <b>segregate</b> the schools. Another blow to the Stanley plan came when Colgate W. Darden, Jr., the former governor of Virginia who was now president of the University of Virginia, announced he opposed the Stanley plan and supported the Gray Commission's original proposals.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} Clamp had some {{difficulty}} adjusting from their typical style after deciding to publish with Weekly Shōnen Magazine. Because their typical thinner lines {{did not give}} the desired impact, Ohkawa expressed the group's desire to make their lines thicker, and to use simpler layouts similar to the other stories already present in Shōnen Magazine. She stated that they used their original artistic style to attract initial readers and then slowly transitioned to a new style. Sometime around when the story arc focused on the Country of Ōto took place, their art style had gradually been changing again; at this point they were thinking of returning to their original style. They were still adjusting to a weekly schedule; many of their previous works were on a monthly schedule. Sugawara expressed concerns about the strain on the artists of concurrently doing a weekly issue of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle linked with xxxHolic, {{but in the end}} he whole-heartedly approved. In accordance with Ohkawa's desire for each to have a well-organized story, Clamp avoids putting references between the two stories too frequently. The main idea was connecting these two series was to have protagonists from two different manga with different personalities and designs. However, during the ending they would be stated to share the same existence, and had to go on different paths. As Tsubasa is connected with xxxHolic, the characters' designs are also meant to be similar; Like xxxHolic, the artwork is sometimes influenced by Ukiyo-e art style which leads to the characters have longer limbs. When asked if another series influenced Tsubasa in the concept of parallel worlds, Ohkawa replied that she was not a fan of sci-fi series and pointed that all worlds shown in the series were other works from Tsubasa. At the same time, she wanted to <b>segregate</b> Tsubasa from previous works. She also explained that while some characters are the same, their traits and personalities were modified due to different backstories.|$|E
