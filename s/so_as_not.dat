5|$|In his {{usage of}} grisaille, van der Weyden distinguishes between the earthly realm {{of flesh and}} blood, and the divine, {{represented}} by ancient sculptural figures, who appear frozen in time. Art historian Shirley Blum believes these figures were relegated to the architectural elements <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> to crowd the central devotional image.|$|E

Venu and Seetha realize that Murali had sacrificed his life for their happiness and remains in their hearts.|$|E

However, on Purim, her family suffers a tragedy when Shira's older sister Esther dies in childbirth. Shira's father subsequently delays the engagement <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> {{to have to deal with}} an empty house so soon after Esther's death. Esther's husband, Yochay, begins to regularly bring their son, Mordechai, to the Mendelman's house, where Shira cares for him.|$|E
5|$|The Queen, {{influenced}} by the Munshi, continued to write to Lord Lansdowne {{on the issue of}} Tyler's promotion and the administration of India. She expressed reservations on the introduction of elected councils on the basis that Muslims would not win many seats because they were in the minority, and urged that Hindu feasts be re-scheduled <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> to conflict with Muslim ones. Lansdowne dismissed the latter suggestion as potentially divisive, but appointed Tyler Acting Inspector General of Prisons in September 1889.|$|E

5|$|To {{give the}} series its own {{distinctive}} musical identity, according to Djawadi, the producers asked {{him not to}} use musical elements such as flutes or solo vocals {{that had already been}} successfully used by other major fantasy productions. He mentioned that a challenge in scoring the series was its reliance on dialogue and its sprawling cast: on several occasions already-scored music had to be omitted <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> {{to get in the way}} of dialogue.|$|E
5|$|A {{campaign}} {{to send an}} American side to the 1920 games in Antwerp started in California after a Berkeley rugby union touring party returned from British Columbia undefeated in 1920. The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) granted permission for entry. A pool of players from Stanford, Berkeley, and Santa Clara made up the squad. 1908 champion Danny Carroll, a player-coach at Stanford at the time, was the team's most prominent member. When the U.S. arrived in Antwerp, the Czechoslovakian and Romanian teams had withdrawn, leaving only France and the United States. The English RFU {{had decided not to}} enter a team, <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> to interfere with the start of the English domestic season.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} inquiry held {{jointly by}} the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Environment Agency was started, but calls for a full public inquiry were declined. The Board included Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree; Prof Dougal Drysdale, an authority on fire safety; and Dr Peter Baxter, a medical expert. Environment Agency and HSE staff were also on the board. Its aim was to identify the immediate causes of the explosion, rather than consider who was to blame for any deficiencies, <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> to prejudice further legal proceedings.|$|E

5|$|A {{radical change}} of tactics, which {{involved}} {{the introduction of}} a bill to ban British subjects from aiding or participating in the slave trade to the French colonies, was suggested by maritime lawyer James Stephen. It was a shrewd move, since the majority of British ships were now flying American flags and supplying slaves to foreign colonies with whom Britain was at war. A bill was introduced and approved by the cabinet, and Wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self-imposed silence, <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> to draw any attention to the effect of the bill. The approach proved successful, and the new Foreign Slave Trade Bill was quickly passed, and received royal assent on 23 May 1806.|$|E

5|$|After Re d'Italia sank, the Italian fleet {{began to}} disengage, with the badly burning Palestro {{trailing}} behind, {{soon to be}} destroyed by a magazine explosion. Persano broke off the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, he refused to counter-attack with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> to risk his success. As night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Among the Fundamental Truths was a {{statement}} regarding speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence of Spirit baptism. Its inclusion was challenged by F.F. Bosworth, an executive presbyter, who argued that while for many speaking in tongues was an evidence of the baptism {{it was not the}} only evidence. The issue was decided at the General Council of September 1918 where Bosworth, who two months earlier had resigned <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> to damage the fellowship, was present and invited to address the council. Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of the fellowship.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, Persano {{broke off}} the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, {{he refused to}} {{counter-attack}} with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition.

As night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively. Kaiser Max had emerged from the battle essentially undamaged, the Italian shells having been unable to penetrate her armor.|$|E
5|$|Courts {{and state}} legislatures also opined on the {{inappropriate}} uses of state seals and arms. Most states barred their use {{for any kind}} of advertising. Reproduction for corporate use was similarly prohibited and such infractions were classified as offenses against public property. The 2003 Code of Federal Regulations pertaining to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives prohibits the use of state seals or coats of arms in product branding <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>not</b> to mislead the public into thinking that a commercial product has been endorsed by a government organization.|$|E
