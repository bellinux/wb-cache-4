40|$|Frost {{build-up}} {{blocks the}} gap between fins and decreases the airflow rate, and the heating capacity and COP of air-source heat pump become lower. The reverse-cycle defrosting (RCD) and hot-gas bypass defrosting HGBD are the two common methods of frost removal. The comparison between the RCD and HGBD methods on one heat pump were not found by authors up to now. This paper compared the dynamic characteristics during the RCD and HGBD periods on one medium air-to-water heat pump of 55 Â kW. The feasibility of the HGBD method without heat provided to evaporate the liquid refrigerant after melting frost, which was supposed in {{the danger of the}} compressor liquid slugging, was especially discussed. The results showed the liquid refrigerant leaving the air cooled coils for the HGBD method was trapped in the <b>suction</b> <b>accumulator</b> and flashed into the saturated gas by the compressor pumping action, and no compressor liquid slugging happened in our tests. The HGBD time was much longer than the RCD time. The amenity for the HGBD method was better than that for the RCD method, due to lower refrigerant noise, smaller indoor temperature fluctuation, and no cold blowing. The suction superheat and discharge superheat for the HGBD method were lower than those for the RCD method. The HGBD could overcome the main disadvantages of the RCD method and deserved the further investigation. Heat pump Hot-gas bypass defrosting Reverse-cycle defrosting...|$|E
40|$|A {{parts of}} the {{contemporary}} rotary compressors are supported as by revolving crankshaft (rotor, roller, etc.), so by the housing (stator, pump, <b>suction</b> <b>accumulator,</b> etc.). Such dual supporting structure complicates assembly of a compressor due to the necessity of precision axial and radial positioning of the pump parts, motor rotor and stator. Developed novel rotary compressor provides a unitary assembly, in which a rotor of the driver -external rotor electric motor, is integrated with concentrically situated pump and rotatably arranged on stationary crankshaft. Stationary crankshaft is fixedly connected to the hermetic housing and supports as the fixed to it motor stator, so the rotor block and the piston block revolving around it. The single structure supporting the motor stator, the rotor block, the piston block and housing simplifies compressor assembly, and allows precision, reliable setting of the parts due to the common single reference - axial line. The piston block and the rotor block have only one line rolling contact, where tangential velocities of blocks are unidirectional and equal in magnitude. It means that the sliding frictional losses at the line contact are minimal. The frictional losses between the rotor blocks radial surfaces and facing surfaces of the piston block heads are also minimal due to the low relative rubbing speed between synchronously revolving in one direction contacting surfaces. Suction system of the novel rotary compressor excluded direct delivery of the refrigerant to the suction chamber by positioning a suction input cavity and a motor cavity in between the suction intake located {{at the top of}} the housing and suction port inlet {{at the top of the}} motor cavity. The arrangement of a refrigerant delivery eliminates external accumulator, increases the liquid refrigerant storage capacity and provides cooling of the compressor motor during and after its duty cycle. The vapor will be delivered substantially free of liquid refrigerant into the suction chamber under higher pressure (supercharged) due to the action of the impeller positioned in the motor cavity. The rotation of the piston block is due to the distributed forces which have been transmitted from an external rotor of the motor through the direct, no sliding line contact between both blocks and through a mechanical link – vane, which is rigidly fixed in the piston block wall. Another advantage of the novel rotary compressor is that the discharge gas will be tangentially ejected in form of one or more high-speed jets in the direction opposite to the direction of rotation. It creates a reaction forces acting in the direction of rotation and added to the forces revolving the piston block. The design modifications described above, employment of an external rotor motor as a driver, elimination of the roller, reciprocating movement of the vane, vane spring, and external accumulator, utilization of new developed tubular discharge valve improve performance of novel rotary compressor, make it compact, (smaller package space), reliable, and reduce manufacturing cost. *) Dreiman N.

40|$|So far, {{there have}} only been a few {{in-depth}} research studies related to system simulation of unitary air conditioners and heat pumps at off-design conditions. However, {{it is clear that}} the current simulation tools and tuning methodologies do not provide accurate predictions at some off-design conditions. This report focuses on improved modeling methods for these situations. Comprehensive experimental and simulation studies are performed in this report to support this effort. Specific accomplishments of this work include identification of improved modeling methods for handling two-phase refrigerant entering the compressor, investigation of the effects of non-uniform distribution of refrigerant flow, investigation of the effects of a <b>suction</b> line <b>accumulator</b> in a heat pump, and development of an improved tuning method for charge modeling. The charge tuning method significantly improves simulations in the case of two-phase refrigerant entering the fixed-area expansion device. ^ An existing system simulation model (ACMODEL) is the major tool that is used for this work and multiple improvements have been made in its capabilities. Based on an exhaustive literature search, the most appropriate up-to-date research results have been incorporated into each component model of the system simulation tool. In addition, a flexible heat exchanger modeling scheme has been developed that allows specification of heat exchanger design and circuiting. ^ Extensive tests with detailed measurements were performed for two R- 410 A air conditioner units, one R- 407 C air conditioner unit, and one R- 22 heat pump unit, which included over 350 points in different test series. All the tests have been simulated and analyzed in the report. The simulations were conducted at both the component level and system level. ^ The overall accuracies of the improved ACMODEL in predicting cooling capacity and compressor power consumption of unitary air conditioners and heat pumps at off-design operating conditions are within 3 % for the cases of no two-phase refrigerant entering the compressor or expansion device. In the cases of, two-phase refrigerant entering the compressor or expansion device, the overall accuracies of the improved ACMODEL in predicting compressor power consumption are within 5 %, and the overall accuracies of predicting cooling capacity are within 10 %. ...|$|R
40|$|Lubricants are {{utilized}} in air-conditioning {{systems for the}} purpose of decreasing friction and wear within the compressor. While ideally the lubricant remains in the compressor, some lubricant is entrained and transported by the refrigerant to the other system components. During operational transients, the lubricant is redistributed throughout the various system components. The equilibrium distribution of lubricant depends among other things on fluid properties, phase change processes, flow rates, geometries, and operating conditions. Experiments were conducted in a commercially available, split-system, residential, air-conditioning system with a nominal 3 -ton capacity that could be operated both as an air-conditioner and a heat-pump. While the system was designed to operate with R 410 A, most of the testing was conducted with pure R 32, which is a leading candidate for R 410 A replacement pending regulatory discontinuation of its other constituent: R 125. The lubricants used in this study were traditional and advanced polyol ester lubricants. Advanced polyol ester lubricants promise to improve lubricity and wear protection compared to current lubricants. The lubricants had nominal viscosities ranging from 32 to 80 cSt. To inventory the distribution of refrigerant and lubricant, the system was modified by the installation of ball valves which could be utilized to separate the system into its constituents: compressor, condenser, liquid line, evaporator, <b>suction</b> line, and <b>accumulator.</b> The system was brought to equilibrium at conditions A, B, C, H 1, and H 2 which are defined in AHRI Standard 210 / 240. After maintaining equilibrium, simultaneously the compressor being shut off and the ball valves were closed which isolated refrigerant and lubricant within each component. The components were subsequently removed and weighed in a manner which allowed the mass of refrigerant and lubricant in each component to be determined. Analysis of the results focuses on the change in mass distribution due to refrigerant-lubricant mixture properties and due to changes in operating conditions. The implications of the net migration of lubricant from the compressor to the remainder of the system will also be discussed...|$|R
