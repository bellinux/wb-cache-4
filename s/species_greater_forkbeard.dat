40|$|Interest in {{sourcing}} high quality non-quota fish species {{continues to increase}} as fish quotas tighten and traditional whitefish stocks decline. Quality aspects of one such species, silver smelt. (Argentinus silus), were examined {{in an article in}} Farm and Food, October-December 1991. This work has now been extended using spot samples of a further six deep water, non-quota species caught in the Atlantic off the north west coast of Ireland. The tests, which will continue on an annual basis, are a co-operative effort between staff at The Fisheries Research Centre and The National Food Centre. The six species evaluated were Bairds smoothead (Alepocephalus bairdii), blue ling, (Molva dypterygia), black scabbard(Aphanopus carbo), rabbitfish (Chimaera monstrosa), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris) and <b>greater</b> <b>forkbeard</b> (Phycis blennoides).

40|$|Dissertação de mest., Aquacultura e Pescas, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Univ. do Algarve, 2011 An {{experimental}} crustacean {{bottom trawling}} survey targeting the {{deep-water rose shrimp}} Parapenaeus longirostris was carried out off the south of Portugal over five 24 -hour cycles. Although circadian bias in the catch rates for this fishery has been reported, no conclusive study had been carried out until now. Catch per unit effort oscillated with {{the time of the}} day. Total catches, both in numbers and weight considerably higher in daytime than at night, suggesting that the 24 -hour light cycle strongly influences catchability of rose shrimp. The rose shrimp, shows a clear shift in abundance from daytime to night hours, with catches decreasing sharply at dusk and, then increasing significantly at dawn. Overall, the most captured fish species: european hake, Merluccius merluccius; monkfish, Lophius budegassa; european conger, Conger conger; and <b>great</b> <b>forkbeard,</b> Phycis blennoides; present the same trend, although less marked. The exceptions are: silver scabbardfish, Lepidopus caudatus; blue Whiting, Micromesistius poutassou; tongue sole, Symphurus nigrescens; atlantic mackarel Scomber scombrus and silver cod, Gadiculus argenteus; whose catches were higher in the night hours. Understanding, the circadian variability in catches of highly valuable commercial species such as the deep-water rose shrimp may contribute to an improved management, by allowing a better control of fishing effort and more efficient use of technical measure...|$|R

40|$|Potential for new {{developments}} in deep water fishing have been identified by two sampling surveys carried out in April and September 1993, in the deep waters off {{the west coast of}} Ireland and Scotland. The primary objective of the two surveys was to secure samples of a variety of potentially commercial deep water fish species in order to examine aspects of their age, growth, reproduction and diet. These data will be essential in formulating management plans for the expanding deep water fisheries in the area. The surveys were conducted on a chartered fishing vessel using a commercial otter trawl, fitted with a small mesh cod-end liner. Fishing activity concentrated on the depth range 400 m- 1200 m and a total of 81 trawling operations were carried out, of which 75 produced fish catches with limited gear damage. Fifteen species of cartilaginous and 50 species of teleost fish were recorded from the catches. These include the roundnose grenadier Coryphaenoides rupestris, black scabbard Aphanopus carbo, <b>greater</b> <b>forkbeard</b> Phycis blennoides, blue-mouth rockfish Helicolenus dactylopterus and Baird's smooth-head Alepocephalus bairdii. Length, weight, sex, maturity and catch data together with samples of otoliths, gonads and stomachs were secured. In general terms, the fishing ground off the north west of Ireland and west of Scotland caused little problems with gear damage and yielded good catches of deep water species. The two surveys have shown the areas have potential for commercial deep water fishing but the development of this fishery in the area will be contingent on the establishment of suitable markets. This initial report documents the surveys and presents some preliminary results. The data gathered from these surveys are currently under analysis at the FRC and the results will be published in the scientific literature...|$|R
40|$|Background. The <b>greater</b> <b>forkbeard,</b> Phycis blennoides (Brünnich, 1768), is a gadiform species, {{which has}} {{economical}} value and its population is dwelling in a 60 – 800 m depth range throughout the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Along African north coast, {{there is a}} lack of information about the biology (age, growth, sex-ratio) of this species. This study provides the first data on population parameters of P. blennoides in Tunisia. Materials and Methods. Specimens of Phycis blennoides were collected from the landings of the artisanal fisheries between September 2007 and June 2010. The length–weight relations were determined according to the allometric equation: W = aTLb. Growth parameters were estimated using the von Bertalanffy growth equation. Results. Length (TL) –Weight (W) relations were allometrically positive for the females (W = 22. 10 – 4 TL 3. 409), males (W = 13. 10 – 4 TL 3. 674), and both sexes (W = 19. 10 – 4 TL 3. 460), without significant differences between males and females. The relation between otolith weight and age showed a significant difference between males and females. The growth parameters were calculated as TL∞ = 57. 17 cm, K = 0. 193 · year– 1, t 0 = – 1. 578 · year for the females, and 44. 74 cm, 0. 313 · year– 1, and – 1. 210 · year for the males, respectively. The females grew faster than the males which did not exceed 45 cm. The growth performance index Ф' calculated for the females (2. 80 cm· year – 1) and males (2. 79 cm· year – 1) yielded similar results. Conclusion. Results reported in this work will contribute to the knowledge on the biology of P. blennoides in Tunisia, with the aim of generating sufficient information to improve future stock management and sustainable fisheries...|$|R

50|$|In 1988, Hurricane Joan hit the rainforests along Nicaragua's Caribbean coast. Douglas Boucher {{and colleagues}} contrasted the {{resistant}} response of Qualea paraensis with the resilient response of Vochysia ferruginea; {{the mortality rate}} was low for Q. paraensis (despite extensive damage to the trees), but the growth rates of surviving trees were also low and few seedlings established. Despite the disturbance, populations were essentially unchanged. In contrast, V. ferruginea experienced very high rates of mortality in the hurricane but showed very high rates of seedling recruitment. As a result, population densities of the species increased. In their study of Jamaican montane forests affected by Hurricane Hugo in 1988, Peter Bellingham and colleagues used the degree of hurricane damage and {{the magnitude of the}} post-hurricane response to categorise tree species into four groups - resistant species (those with limited storm damage and low response), susceptible <b>species</b> (<b>greater</b> damage but low response), usurpers (limited damage but high response) and resilient <b>species</b> (<b>greater</b> damage and high response).|$|R
