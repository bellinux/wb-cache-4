40|$|Abstract. Catastrophic {{failure is}} often {{associated}} with a large temperature rise. This situation may lead to a drastic deterioration in material strength where a cooling system is important for a smooth system plant operation to prevent catastrophic failure to its equipments, parts or processes. In this study, a part of a failed closed recirculation system water <b>cooling</b> <b>pipe</b> in a steel manufacturing plant in Malaysia has been investigated for detailed failure analysis. A steam leakage of a water <b>cooling</b> <b>pipe</b> with a closed recirculation system operation made of ASTM A 106 /A (Carbon Steel Pipes for high temp service) was detected.

Detailed investigation was carried out by visual inspection, optical microscopy and hardness testing. With the evidence obtained, due to presence of water scale and prolonged overheating, decarburization had occurred. During decarburization, it was found that carbon elements from inner surface tube had depleted through the outer tube surface. The accumulation of carbon elements on the outer tube surface appears to show significantly higher brittle zone in the outer tube and with the presence of tensile stress developed from operating thermal cycle which subsequently resulted in crack.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{results from}} laboratory tests and numerical analyses of stress states in concrete structures arising from volume changes due to temperature and shrinkage during hydration. The laboratory tests presented here deal with: {{the determination of}} heat transfer coefficients for <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes</b> measurements of self-desiccation and shrinkage under sealed conditions deformation measurements under temperature and moisture changes and measurements of stress development during hardening for a fully restrained structural member. The thesis comprises three papers dealing with the following topics:Paper A - Air cooling of concrete by means of embedded <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes.</b> Laboratory tests of heat transfer coefficientsThis paper presents a laboratory method for determining heat transfer coefficients for <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes.</b> The embedded <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes</b> are used {{in order to reduce}} the temperature rise in massive structures as a measure against thermal cracking. When air is used as cooling medium, relative large diameters with surface profiles (roughness) causing friction losses along the pipe are preferable. Heat transfer coefficients for two different types of <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes</b> have been determined for varying pipe flows in combination with different temperature levels. Paper (A) constitutes the first part of the thesis dealing with the laboratory tests on heat transfer coefficients. Paper B - Air cooling of concrete by means of embedded <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes.</b> Application in designPaper B constitutes the second report on the subject air cooling of concrete. Embedded <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes</b> are used {{in order to reduce the}} risk of thermal cracking in early age concrete. Traditionally, water has been used as the cooling medium, but air cooling has shown to be advantageous in many applications. The experimentally determined heat transfer coefficients of <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes,</b> investigated in Paper A, have been used and verified in comparisons with in situ measurements at the Igelsta Bridge in Södertälje, Sweden. The close agreement between measured and calculated temperatures of air-cooled sections seems to justify the use of average heat transfer coefficients. A few exemplifying calculations are also given, and the general behaviour of cooled structures is discussed. The principles of designing cooling systems for the general case are proposed. It is concluded that it is possible to design prismatic structures, such as a columns, by the use of existing models and the measured heat transfer coefficients evaluated according to the method presented in Paper A. Paper C - Deformation and Stresses in Hardening Concrete due to Simultaneous Changes in Humidity and Temperature. Laboratory tests and evaluation This paper describes test methods and equipments for determination of strength and maturity growth, heat of reaction, and free thermal deformation. Measurements of shrinkage, relative humidity and stress development are carried out under sealed conditions during hardening of the young concrete. Results for both high performance and normal strength concretes are presented and discussed here. Also, methods for describing shrinkage at sealed conditions as a function of maturity and as a decrease in relative humidity are presented. An evaluation is performed of the free thermal deformation during the hardening of concrete where the deformation is separated into pure thermal deformation and shrinkage. In this context some pilot calculations of non-linear modelling of stress development have been performed taking stress-induced deformations and simultaneous changes in humidity and temperature into account. Calculations are made for a structural member which is fully restrained, i. e. to a degree of 100 %. A sensibility analysis of the non-linear stress model is performed and presented.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} requirements for Gen. IV Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is passive safety. Currently all the gas cooled version of VHTR designs use Reactor Vessel Auxiliary Cooling System (RVACS) for passive decay heat removal. The decay heat first is transferred to the core barrel by conduction and radiation, and then to the reactor vessel by thermal radiation and convection; finally the decay heat is transferred to natural circulated air or water systems. RVACS can be characterized as a surface based decay heat removal system. The RVACS is especially suitable for smaller power reactors since small systems have relatively larger surface area to volume ratio. However, RVACS limits the maximum achievable power level for modular VHTRs due to the mismatch between the reactor power (proportional to volume) and decay heat removal capability (proportional to surface area). When the relative decay heat removal capability decreases, the peak fuel temperature increases, even close to the design limit. Annular core designs with inner graphite reflector can mitigate this effect; therefore can further increase the reactor power. Another way to increase the reactor power is to increase power density. However, the reactor power is also limited by the decay heat removal capability. Besides the safety considerations, VHTRs also need to be economical in order to compete with other reactor concepts and other types of energy sources. The limit of decay heat removal capability set by using RVACS has affected the economy of VHTRs. A potential alternative solution is to use a volume-based passive decay heat removal system, called Direct Reactor Auxiliary Cooling Systems (DRACS), to remove or mitigate the limitation on decay heat removal capability. DRACS composes of natural circulation loops with two sets of heat exchangers, one on the reactor side and another on the environment side. For the reactor side, <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes</b> will be inserted into holes made in the outer or inner graphite reflector blocks. There will be gaps between these <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes</b> and their corresponding surrounding graphite surfaces. Graphite has an excellent heat conduction property. By taking advantage of this feature, we can have a volume-based method to remove decay heat. The scalability can be achieved, if needed, by employing more rows of <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes</b> to accommodate higher decay heat rates. Since heat can easily conduct through the graphite regions between the holes made for the <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes,</b> those <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes</b> located further away from the active core region can still be very effective in removing decay heat. By removing the limit on the decay heat removal capability due to the limited available surface area as in a RVACS, the reactor power and power density can be significantly increased, without losing the passive heat removal feature. This paper will introduce the concept of using DRACS to enhance VHTR passive safety and economics. Three design options will be discussed, depending on the <b>cooling</b> <b>pipe</b> locations. Analysis results from a lumped volume based model and CFD simulations will be presented...|$|R
