5000|$|Both {{economic}} and social factors drove the enclosure movement. In particular, the demand for land in the seventeenth century, increasing regional specialisation, engrossment in landholding and a shift in beliefs regarding the importance of [...] "common wealth" [...] (usually implying common livelihoods) {{as opposed to the}} [...] "public good" [...] (the wealth of the nation or the GDP) all laid the groundwork for a <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> among elites to favour enclosure. Enclosures were conducted by agreement among the landholders (not necessarily the tenants) throughout the seventeenth century; enclosure by Parliamentary Act began in the eighteenth century. Enclosed lands normally could demand higher rents than unenclosed, and thus landlords had an economic stake in enclosure, even if they did not intend to farm the land directly.|$|R

40|$|Research on {{the impact}} of the {{macroeconomy}} on individual-level preferences for redistribution has produced varying results. This paper presents a new theory on the presence of an expansive welfare state during one’s formative years as a source of heterogeneity in the effect that macroeconomic conditions have on individuals’ preferences for redistributive policy. This theory is tested using cohort analysis via the British Social Attitudes surveys (1983 – 2010), with generations coming of age between the end of World War I and today. Findings confirm that cohorts that were socialised before and after the introduction of the welfare state react differently to economic crises: the former become less supportive of redistribution, while the latter become more supportive. The research sheds light on the long-term <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the welfare state due to generational replacement...|$|R

40|$|The Strang-Fix {{conditions}} are necessary {{and sufficient to}} reproduce spaces of algebraic polynomials up to some degree by integer <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> compactly <b>supported</b> functions. W. Dahmen and Ch. Micchelli (Linear Algebra Appl. 52 / 3 : 217 - 234, 1983) introduced a generalization of the Strang-Fix conditions to affinely invariant subspaces of higher degree polynomials. C. de Boor (Constr. Approx. 3 : 199 - 208, 1987) raised a question on the necessity of scale-invariance of polynomial space for an arbitrary function; and he omitted the scale-invariance restriction on the space. In the paper, we present a matrix approach to determine (not necessarily scale-invariant) polynomial space contained in the span <b>of</b> integer <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> a compactly <b>supported</b> function. Also, in the paper, we consider scaling functions that we call the elliptic scaling functions (Int. J. Wavelets Multiresolut. Inf. Process.

Namely we prove that any algebraic polynomial contained in the span <b>of</b> integer <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> a compactly <b>supported</b> elliptic scaling function belongs to the null-space of a homogeneous elliptic differential operator.

5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of General Abdullah Mohamed Fadil, Abdullahi Ahmed Irro and other senior Somali military officials formulated a plan of attack for {{what was to become}} the Ogaden War in Ethiopia. This was part of a broader effort to unite all of the Somali-inhabited territories in the Horn region into a Greater Somalia (Soomaaliweyn). At the start of the offensive, the SNA consisted of 35,000 soldiers, and was vastly outnumbered by the Ethiopian forces. Somali national army troops seized the Godey Front on 24 July 1977, after the 60th Division defeated the Ethiopian 4th Infantry Division. Godey's capture allowed the Somali side to consolidate its hold on the Ogaden, concentrate its forces, and advance further to other regions of Ethiopia. The invasion reached an abrupt end with the Soviet Union's sudden <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> to Ethiopia, followed by almost the entire communist world siding with the latter. The Soviets halted supplies to Barre's regime and instead increased the distribution of aid, weapons, and training to Ethiopia's newly communist Derg regime. General Vasily Ivanovich Petrov was assigned to restructure the Ethiopian Army. The Soviets also brought in around 15,000 Cuban troops to assist the Ethiopian military. By 1978, the Somali forces were pushed out of most of the Ogaden, although it would take nearly three more years for the Ethiopian Army to gain full control of Godey.|$|R

To analyze the stability of helical springs, {{the concept of an}} equivalent column was applied and a general system <b>of</b> <b>supports</b> described by three independent compliances was utilized. In the general case, the solution obtained, which describes the critical force, depends on two rotational compliances and a lateral compliance <b>of</b> a transverse <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> the <b>support.</b> The influence <b>of</b> the individual compliances on the critical load and on the limiting slenderness ratio was studied. Simple approximation formulas were proposed to describe these relationships. Key words: helical spring, stability, support compliance, slenderness ratio 1. Introductory remarks Helical springs, specially compression ones, fulfil different functions in the technique: do the work, store energy, alleviate the impact, raise or take vibration and many others. Moreover, they may be subjected to loss of stability. A helical spring should be treated as a spatially curved bar. Such an approach, based on Kirchhoff-Clebsh equations and geometrically non-linear theory, was developed by Nikolai (1955). It was applied to the problems of stability of helical springs, among others, by Cherny...|$|R
