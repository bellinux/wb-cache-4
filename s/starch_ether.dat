40|$|Groupe de travail n° 2 : Interactions éther de cellulose-ciment du CEReM (Consortium d'Etudes et de Recherches sur les Mortiers) Polysaccharides are {{polymers}} frequently {{introduced into}} mortar formulations {{in order to}} improve the workability and water retention capacity of the fresh materials [1]. Among all the polysaccharides, cellulose ethers seem to be the most suitable molecules to obtain a mortar with pretty good water retention ability (i. e. higher than 94 %). On the other hand, polysaccharides such as <b>starch</b> <b>ethers</b> or <b>starches</b> generally induce a low increase in water retention (i. e. up to 85 %). Mortar consistency may contribute to its water retention capacity but this hypothesis should be checked by further investigations. Indeed, cellulose ethers could induce excellent water retention thanks to the possible superposition of two phenomena [2]: - a rheological effect similar to the one caused by other polysaccharides; - an effect that could be specific to cellulose ethers, which remains to be defined. It could be caused by a modification of the porous network in the fresh state, osmotic pressure or the presence of a cellulose ether film playing the role of diffusion barrier. The molar mass distribution of polysaccharides has been determined by size exclusion chromatography. Using such well-known molecules, {{it should be possible to}} understand the functioning of three types of cellulose ethers (HEC, HPMC and HEMC) on mortar water retention. Then, the influence of mortar consistency on water retention has been studied in order to verify if there is a relationship between these two parameters. To complete the panel, the impact of <b>starch</b> <b>ethers</b> on water retention and mortar consistency has also been investigated...|$|R
40|$|Our work {{aimed at}} the {{optimization}} {{of the structure of}} native starch for the preparation of concentrated water-based dispersions with film forming properties for the application in paints and varnishes. Potato and smooth pea starches were degraded via ManOx and hypochlorite conversion (9. 4 – 0. 2 • 106 g/mol) and used as starting materials for esterification and etherification reactions with different chain lengths (C 2 -C 6) and varied degrees of substitution (DS) / molar substitutions (MS) (0. 05 - 1. 1) for an increase in their hydrophobicity. The applied modification conditions led to cold water soluble or dispersible products with concentrations between 30 and 45 % (w/w) and viscosities in the range of 102 – 103 mPa•s (100 s- 1). The most samples had a newtonian flow behaviour and showed viscoelastic properties with higher values for the loss modulus (G’’) than the storage modulus (G’). Continuous films were observed with starch esters in the DS range of 0. 1 - 0. 8 {{and in the case of}} the <b>starch</b> <b>ethers</b> with MS values of 0. 7 - 0. 9. Wet and dry layer thicknesses of 25 - 50 μm and 7 - 12 μm were obtained (doctor blade: 100 μm). In the cross cut test on glass plates the esters had clearly better results with values of 0 and 1 (ISO class), in contrast to the tested ether with values of 4. The compatibility tests with 3 commercial binders showed that two Acronal binders (A 754 and S 559) (42 %) showed compatibility with the modified starches (58 %). Selected starch esters showed also good adhesion (class 0 and 1) on aluminium plates while the tested ether could be classified in the worst class (5).

40|$|International audienceCellulose ethers (CE) are {{commonly}} used as additives {{to improve the quality}} of cement-based materials. As admixtures, they improve the properties of mortars such as water retention, workability, and open time. Also, polysaccharides such as starch derivatives are used to improve the consistency of the fresh material. The properties of cement-based mortars at fresh state were investigated. The effect of CE and their physico-chemical parameters (molecular weight, substitution degrees, etc.) on both water retention and rheological properties of mortars were studied. Moreover, some starch derivatives were also examined in order to better understand the water retention mechanisms. Rheological measurements showed that CE have a thickening effect for a content of 0. 27 wt. %. Besides, a fundamental effect of CE molecular weight on mortar consistency and its water retention capability was highlighted. Finally, the comparison with <b>starch</b> <b>ethers</b> proved that, for those admixtures, water retention is not directly linked to mortar's viscosity...|$|R
40|$|When {{a mixture}} of starch and alkali is treated with chlora-cetic acid, or sodium chloracetate, a {{water-soluble}} <b>starch</b> <b>ether</b> known as carboxymethyl starch is obtained. If one uses the simplified formula (â€”O â€”G 1 (OH) 3 â€” 0 â€”) to repre sent the anhydroglucose repeating unit present in starch, then (-O-G 1 (OH) 2 (OCH 2 -COOH) - 0) would represent a mono-substituted carboxymethyl ether of this repeating unit. Such a starch derivative is described as having a degree of sub stitution of 1. 0. Fully etherified starch would have a degree of substitution of 3. 0. The modification of the starch molecule may bring about a change in its physiological action. It has been reported by some observers (Brown and Houghton, ' 41; Werle, ' 41; Rowe et al., ' 44; Shelanski and Clark, ' 48) that a modified cellulose preparation, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, is harm less physiologically.

40|$|With its {{worldwide}} {{availability and}} its low market-price native starch provides {{the potential for}} the use as a bio-based material. However, in its native form it is highly hydrophilic, not cold-water dispersible and only forms brittle films. So, our work aimed at the chemical modification of degraded starch for the application in the coating sector as binder, with the focus on paints and varnishes. For this purpose, cold-water dispersible hydrophobized <b>starch</b> esters and <b>ethers</b> with high solid contents (≥ 30 % (w/w)) and viscosities between 100 and 1000 mPa•s should be synthesized. Additionally, they should form continuous films and show adhesion to different substrates. As starting product a degraded potato starch with a molar mass of 1. 18 • 105 g/mol was used and modified by carboxylic acid anhydrides (C 2 -C 4) and carboxylic acid vinylesters (C 6) {{in the case of the}} esters. Epoxy alkane derivatives were used for the synthesis of hydroxyalkyl <b>starch</b> <b>ethers</b> (C 3 -C 4, C 6). Beside the type of substituent and the chain length, also the degrees of substitution (DS) and molar substitutions (MS) were varied from 0. 05 to 1. 1. The modification led to cold water-soluble or dispersible products with applicable concentrations between 30 and 45 % (w/w) and viscosities in the range of 102 - 103 mPa•s (100 s - 1). The most samples had a newtonian flow behaviour and showed viscoelastic properties with higher values for the loss modulus (G’’). Continuous films were observed with starch esters in the DS range of 0. 11 - 0. 81 and in the case of the <b>starch</b> <b>ethers</b> with MS values of 0. 77 - 0. 91. Wet and dry layer thicknesses of 25 - 50 μm and 7 - 12 μm were obtained (doctor blade: 100 μm).

The compatibility tests with 3 commercial binders showed that two Acronal binders (A 754 & S 559) (42 %) showed compatibility with the modified starches (58 %). According our experiments and especially based on the results of the film formation and the cross cut test the starch esters and not the ethers could be the preferred class for an application in the coating sector.

40|$|Papermakers {{are highly}} {{interested}} in upgrading mechanical paper by retarding or inhibiting the lignin color reversion. Yellowing {{can be prevented}} by screening UV light {{on the surface and}} adding yellowing inhibitors into papers. Surface treatment of paper in a size press by an inhibitor-starch mixture has more advantages compared to other methods. A novel microscopy technique using scanning electron microscopy is developed to identify and measure the polymer penetration into sized sheets. The kinetics of starch adsorption on wood fibers was elucidated. An initial high adsorption of cationic starch on pulp fibers is off set by high desorption rates. Furthermore the adsorption of hydroxyethyl <b>ether</b> <b>starch</b> increases smoothly with time due to polymer penetration into the macropores. At high salt concentrations, cationic starch does not make strong bonds with negatively charged fibers and as a result the desorption rate increases and the maximum adsorption approaches zero. The presence of salt has little effect on the adsorption of non-ionic hydroxyethyl <b>ether</b> <b>starch.</b> Preferential adsorption of amyIose compared to amylopectin on cellulosic fibers is related to the size exclusion mechanism involved in polymer penetration into macropores. The presence of cationic starch clusters is confirmed. The clusters initially adsorb on the fiber surface; however due to a higher desorption rate they are gradually replaced by individual polymers. The cluster size decreases with increasing shear in the presence of salt in cationic starch solutions. The cluster desorption rate for pulp fibers is higher than that for glass substrates. This might be due to different surface chemistry or roughness between pulp fibers and glass substrates. The maximum adsorption on glass substrates increases by increasing the cluster size. Hydroxyethyl <b>ether</b> <b>starch</b> does not form clusters and shear and the presence of salt have a minor effect on the polymer size. Starch pickup by paper during surface sizing depends on the liquid absorption at the puddle and counter pressure of the trapped air in the pores. Starch viscosity, paper velocity and nip load have no effect on the thickness of the starch layer across the sized paper. However, for thick boards penetration increases by increasing the nip load due to lower sheet thickness at higher nip load. For sized board, the starch penetration is less for cationic starch than for hydroxyethyl <b>ether</b> <b>starch</b> due to higher viscosity and adsorption. For the sized sheets with yellowing inhibitor/starch mixtures, the paper brightness after aging is affected by inhibitor concentration in the solution, since operating conditions have little effect on pickup. Using cationic starch slightly increases the brightness for boards, while it has little effect on paper brightness...|$|R

40|$|Cationic <b>starch</b> <b>ethers</b> {{prepared}} by the chemical reaction of starch with a quaternary ammonium reagent are commercially important derivatives. Cationic potato starch derivatives were produced under pilot-scale conditions, employing four different principles. Wet cationisation {{was carried out by}} the slurry and paste processes, in which the cationic reagent and catalyst are added to the starch. Besides being {{prepared by}} these more commonly used processes, cationic starches were also produced by dry cationisation and by adding the cationic reagent during extrusion of starch. The cationic reagent used was 2, 3 epoxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride. Derivatives with three graded degrees of substitution (DS) between 0. 03 and 0. 12 were prepared by each process. The physical properties of the derivatives were analysed by the following methods: polarised light microscopy, X-ray scattering, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), solubility and swelling behaviour, and High-Performance Size-Exclusion Chromatography-Multiangle Laser Light Scattering (HPSEC-MALLS). The degree of substitution was determined by high resolution C- 13 -NMR spectroscopy after hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid. The properties of the cationic starch derivatives were highly dependent on the derivatisation method. The granular structure of the starch was not visibly affected by the slurry process. Products from the semi-dry reaction showed some granular damage, which was particularly evident after suspension of the granules in water. In the paste and extrusion processes, the starch granules were completely destroyed. Swelling temperatures and enthalpies can be determined only for starch derivatives that still retain a granular structure. As a result, samples from the paste and extrusion reactions exhibited no swelling endotherm in DSC. The samples from the slurry process showed a shift in the swelling temperature range towards lower temperature and a decrease in swelling enthalpy both as compared to native potato starch and also with increasing DS. Similar behaviour was found for the samples from the semi-dry process. The swelling temperature region was comparable to that of the slurry samples for the same DS but the swelling enthalpy was distinctly lower, indicating that the granular structure of the starch was altered far more by the semi-dry than the slurry process. Swelling in excess water and solubility were affected primarily by the cationisation process, while the influence of DS was of minor importance. The extrusion products had pronounced cold-water solubility, the semi-dry products showed increasing told-water solubility with increasing DS, the paste products were highly swollen in cold water and the slurry products were insoluble in cold water. All products were soluble in hot water but the state of dissolution was different. The molar mass distributions of the samples were determined after dissolution by pressure cooking. The different derivatisation methods resulted in characteristic molar mass distributions. The average molar mass decreased in the order slurry, semi-dry-, paste and extrusion process...|$|R

40|$|Regression models {{including}} chemical composition, {{in vitro}} digestibility and {{near infrared reflectance}} spectroscopy (NIRS) were compared in order to predict the energy value of several feed ingredients for poultry. The nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolisable energy content (AMEn) in cockerels and its proportion on total gross energy (AMEn/GE) were determined in 94 batches from six starchy grains and six cereal byproducts. Two preliminary trials were also designed to adapt in vitro methods for prediction of in vivo energy values for poultry. Mean concentrations of AMEn of the ingredient studied ranged from 2, 464 to 3, 595 kcal kg - 1 DM, and those of AMEn/GE from 53. 7 to 80. 0 %. The most precise model of prediction of AMEn and AMEn/GE values was that based on NIRS equations (R 2 cv = 0. 823 and 0. 861, respectively). The best single chemical predictor of these energy values was the neutral detergent fibre concentration (R 2 = 0. 616 and 0. 736, respectively). Further inclusion of ether extract and ash contents in the AMEn model and those of <b>starch</b> and <b>ether</b> extract in the AMEn/GE model allowed increasing coefficients of determination up to 0. 791 and 0. 839, respectively. A model including linear and quadratic effects of in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMd) provided a similar prediction of AMEn/GE values (R 2 = 0. 833). However the prediction of AMEn from IVOMd was worse (R 2 = 0. 62), as variations among batches of GE concentration (from 4, 225 to 5, 896 kcal kg – 1 DM) were little related to in vitro digestibility values...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of different carbohydrate sources associated with sunflower oil on intake, digestibility of nutrients and nitrogen balance in diets of lambs. Twenty lambs were used, assigned in a completely randomized design with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments with two sources of neutral detergent soluble carbohydrate, starch and neutral detergent soluble fiber, with and without the inclusion of 4. 2 % sunflower oil. The dry matter intake was not affected by carbohydrate sources and the inclusion of oil. Diets with a high percentage of starch provided higher digestibility of dry matter, <b>starch</b> and <b>ether</b> extract. The different sources of carbohydrates had no interference on digestibility of organic matter, crude protein, neutral detergent soluble fiber, nonfiber carbohydrates, neutral detergent fiber, hemicellulose and acid detergent fiber. The addition of oil in the diets increased the digestibility of ether extract. The combination of 4. 2 % oil in the diet high in soluble neutral detergent fiber had no influence on the nutrient digestibility, otherwise, the addition of oil at high starch diet caused a significant reduction in the digestibility of organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, hemicellulose and nonfiber carbohydrates. The quantities of nitrogen intake, absorbed and retained, did not differ as sources of carbohydrates and oil inclusion in the diet. The association of 4. 2 % sunflower oil to the different sources of carbohydrates in the diet does not affect consumption and nitrogen metabolism in lambs.
