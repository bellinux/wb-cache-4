5|$|In May 2014, Sinclair {{informed}} the FCC {{that it was}} unable to find buyers for WABM or WMMP – the company's MyNetworkTV stations in Birmingham, Alabama and Charleston, South Carolina that it planned to sell in its purchase of Allbritton Communications. In Birmingham, the company proposed surrendering the licenses of WCFT-TV and WJSU-TV – the two full-powered satellites of ABC affiliate WBMA-LD, converting WABM into a full-powered satellite of WBMA-LD – and moving its existing MyNetworkTV programming to a digital <b>subchannel</b> of WABM (although the WBMA-LD simulcast was placed on WABM's <b>subchannel</b> instead while MyNetworkTV programming was retained on its main channel). Similarly, in Charleston, Sinclair planned to surrender WCIV's license and move its ABC affiliation and programming to WMMP. In both cases, Sinclair believed that its own stations had superior technical facilities than those of the stations it intends to surrender. Sinclair was able to retain WBMA-LD in any event as the FCC does not impose any ownership limits on low-power stations.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, after {{temporarily}} {{losing its}} Fox affiliation for WFFT-TV to a <b>subchannel</b> of WISE-TV {{due to a}} reverse compensation dispute, Nexstar (ironically, given its use of similar practices in other markets) filed an antitrust lawsuit against the station's managing partner, Granite Broadcasting, arguing that it had built a monopoly on local advertising sales by having effective control of the outlets for five major networks (ABC and MyNetworkTV on WPTA, and NBC, Fox, and The CW on WISE-TV; owned by Malara Broadcast Group and operated under agreements by Granite). The lawsuit was settled in February 2013 via mutual agreement, after which the Fox affiliation was given back to WFFT.|$|E
5|$|The city is the {{principal}} city in the Meridian, Mississippi Designated Market Area (DMA), which includes 72,180 households with televisions. WTOK-TV broadcasts as an ABC affiliate from the city, headquartered at 815 23rd Avenue. WTOK operates two digital subchannels, WTOK-DT2, a MyNetworkTV affiliate, and WTOK-DT3, Meridian's CW. WGBC-TV, the market's NBC affiliate, is headquartered at 1151 Crestview Circle. Since January 5, 2009, WGBC has also been the market's FOX affiliate, and it also features some programming from the Retro Television Network (RTN). WGBC operates under a program services agreement with WMDN-TV, the market's CBS affiliate which operates a local AccuWeather service on its second <b>subchannel.</b> WMAW-TV is the local affiliate of Mississippi Public Broadcasting.|$|E
30|$|In {{parallel}} interference channel, {{the signals}} in different <b>subchannels</b> of one user is transmitted {{by the same}} transmitter; thus, the <b>subchannels</b> can be jointly encoded. Similarly, the signals received in different <b>subchannels</b> of the same user can be jointly decoded. The basic idea of the proposed transmission scheme is as follows. In weak interference <b>subchannels,</b> the bits is transmitted at the maximal possible data rate of the direct-link without considering the existence of cross-link interference. In strong interference <b>subchannels,</b> the bits that will generate interference in weak interference <b>subchannels</b> is retransmitted following a certain rule. The received signals in weak interference <b>subchannels</b> and strong interference <b>subchannels</b> are then jointly decoded.|$|R

WFMJ-TV and its digital <b>subchannel</b> WBCB are both locally owned & operated by the Maag family, owners of The Vindicator.

25|$|After Tribune {{agreed to}} {{affiliate}} WTTV with CBS, the station originally {{announced plans to}} shift its existing CW affiliation to WTTV/WTTK's second digital <b>subchannel</b> upon the switch. This would have made Indianapolis the largest market where The CW is carried as a subchannel-only affiliation, a title held from the network's 2006 launch by Cincinnati, Ohio, where CBS affiliate WKRC-TV (which, ironically, is now owned by former WTTV/WTTK parent Sinclair Broadcast Group) carries the network on its second <b>subchannel,</b> until May 2017, when San Diego CBS affiliate KFMB-TV began carrying The CW over its DT2 feed. On December 7, 2014, This TV moved from WTTV's 4.2 <b>subchannel</b> to a newly created 59.3 <b>subchannel</b> on WXIN, with 4.2 simulcasting the station's primary feed pending the planned move of CW programming to the <b>subchannel.</b>|$|E

25|$|On July 15, 2015, WADL added Grit to 38.2, moving Get TV to 38.3 in the process. This caused The Word Network to be {{temporarily}} {{removed from}} the station' <b>subchannel</b> entirely. The Word Network eventually returned to WADL on September 18 of that year, replacing Antenna TV on 38.4. WADL will add Cozi TV to 38.4 on February 1, 2016, displaced from WMYD 20.2 by Antenna TV. It is unknown {{what will happen to}} The Word Network's current affiliation on 38.4, but on May 4, 2017, returned The Word Network on a newly-created fifth <b>subchannel,</b> and added Justice Network to the new 38.6 <b>subchannel.</b> WADL also added the simulcast of WFDF-AM (audio only) to the new 38.7 <b>subchannel,</b> on May 26, 2017.|$|E
