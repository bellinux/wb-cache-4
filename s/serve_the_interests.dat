However they did not represent the Army or the Armada, but were instead expected to <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> of the city or province which had elected them. PedroI chose nine military officers as Senators and appointed five (out of fourteen) to the Council of State. During the Regency, two were named to the Senate and none to the Council of State (this body was dormant during the Regency). PedroII chose four officers as Senators during the 1840s, two in the 1850s and three others during the remaining years of his reign. He also appointed seven officers to be State Councilors during the 1840s and 1850s, and three others after that.|$|E
5|$|Since 1789, {{the press}} had been speculating that Garrow, a Whig, would enter Parliament; however {{he was first}} elected in 1805 for Gatton. This was a rotten borough, with Garrow {{appointed}} to <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> of his patron. After his entry into politics Garrow at first paid little attention, not making his maiden speech until 22 April 1806, when he opposed a charge for the impeachment of Marquess Wellesley. He spoke again on 18 June 1806 on a legal technicality, and after that did not intervene for another six years. Braby and other sources indicate {{that he did not}} enjoy his time in Parliament, and was rarely there unless required to conduct some business.|$|E
5|$|However, Matsui {{had made}} it clear to his {{superiors}} even before he had left Japan in August that he was determined to capture the capital city of China, Nanking, which lay 300 kilometers west of Shanghai. Matsui forcefully asserted that the war with China would not end until Nanking was in their control, and he envisaged that the fall of Nanking would result in the total collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's government. After Chiang's fall Matsui hoped {{to play a role in}} forming a new government in China which, according to his own conception, would be a democracy that would better <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> of both Japan and the people of China. However, the historian Tokushi Kasahara also sees personal motives behind Matsui's insistence on capturing Nanking. Kasahara suspects that Matsui, as an aging general with a relatively undistinguished military record, desperately wanted to crown his career with one last battlefield victory like the capture of the Chinese capital.|$|E

Another interpretation asserts that the proposition is that an act has moral worth only if the principle acted upon generates moral action non-contingently. If the shopkeeper in the above example had made his choice contingent upon what would <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> of his business, then his act has no moral worth.|$|E
25|$|Astor {{had been}} a {{supporter}} of Nelson Mandela and an opponent of South Africa's apartheid regime since shortly after he was jailed in 1964. He continued to support the campaign for Mandela's release until he was finally set free from prison in February 1990, and continued to oppose the apartheid regime until it was finally completely abolished four years later, just before Mandela became {{the prime minister of}} South Africa. In September 1990, he controversially compared Myra Hindley's continuing imprisonment to the long sentence that Nelson Mandela served for his part in the anti-Apartheid activities of black South Africans, claiming that Myra Hindley was being kept in prison longer than necessary to <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> of successive Home Secretaries and their governments. Lord Longford and others who campaigned for Hindley's release would also go on to claim that Hindley was kept in prison for this reason.|$|E
25|$|Since its formation, Jobbik had a {{strongly}} critical stance towards the European Union.

However, even in this period, the party did not refused {{the idea of a}} radically reformed European confederation. After the Brexit and the continuous debates {{on the future of the}} European Union, the party has reassessed its views on the EU and started to emphasize that by adequate policies a reform of the EU, that could make the organization advantageous for the European nations, is possible. According to Jobbik, Hungary should join the Eurozone as soon as possible since it is a not a political but an economic question. On his press conference on 27 October 2017 the president of the party, Gábor Vona told, if some conditions were fulfilled Jobbik could even support further deepening of the EU.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, {{he campaigned}} {{alongside}} Lord Longford {{to try and}} gain parole for the Moors Murderer Myra Hindley, claiming {{that she was a}} reformed character and no threat to society, and had therefore qualified for parole from the life sentence imposed on her in 1966 for the role while Ian Brady in the murder of three children. He continued his campaign even after Hindley admitted taking part in two more murders in 1986. In September 1990, he even claimed that her continued imprisonment was comparable to that of Nelson Mandela, who had just been released from prison in South Africa after serving 27 years of a life sentence for his part in the battle against the oppression of black people under that country's apartheid regime. Astor had also been a supporter of the campaign for Mandela's release from prison. Along with Longford, he claimed that she was being kept in prison to <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> of successive Home Secretaries and their governments (who had the power to decide on minimum terms for life sentence prisoners from 1983 until 2002); these politicians gradually increased Hindley's original minimum of 25 years to 30 years and from 1990 to a whole life tariff. The campaign to win parole for Myra Hindley was unsuccessful, with her appeal against the whole life tariff being rejected three times by the High Court, and she remained in prison until her death in November 2002, almost a year after Astor's own death. Longford had died earlier in 2001.|$|E

He felt that liberalism represented {{the welfare of}} individual people, as opposed to organizations—governments, businesses, etc.—preserving freedom of thought and action. For him, conservatism was concerned with preserving institutions that <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> of people, collectively. Conservatives, according to Flanders, could find themselves offering [...] "reasoned objections to foolish proposals" [...] by emotionally motivated liberals.

500|$|The {{manipulation}} of the emirate [...] by Al Muhanna {{for such a long}} time was the result of their ability to <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> of the Mamluk state more than any other clan. Their prestige was such that they were able to maintain peace and order among the tribes and—what was much more important—to secure the safety of the hajj and trade routes. That is why the sultans of Egypt and their provincial governors (sing. na'ib) in Damascus and Aleppo tried always to keep them under control and use every possible way to bring them back under the authority of the sultanate when they revolted, because their remaining outside Mamluk authority would lead to continuous threats to the state's interests, the outcome of which would be the attacking and looting of the trade caravans, the disruption of the hajj, and considerable damage to the countryside.|$|E
500|$|Bottomley's obituaries dwelt on {{the common}} theme of wasted talent: a man of {{brilliant}} natural abilities, destroyed by [...] greed and vanity. [...] "He had personal magnetism, eloquence, {{and the power to}} convince", wrote his Daily Mail obituarist. [...] "He might have been a leader at the Bar, a captain of industry, a great journalist. He might have been almost anything". The Straits Times of Singapore thought that Bottomley could have rivalled Lloyd George as a national leader: [...] "Though he deserved his fate, the news of his passing will awaken the many regrets for the good which he did when he was Bottomley the reformer and crusader and the champion of the bottom dog". A later historian, Maurice Cowling, pays tribute to Bottomley's capacity and industry, and to his forceful campaigns in support of liberty. In his sketch for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Morris delivers a different judgement: [...] "e claimed to <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> of others, but sought only his own gratification".|$|E

500|$|Opposition to Prussia's strong-armed tactics {{surfaced}} in other {{social and political}} groups. Throughout the German states, city councils, liberal parliamentary members who favored a unified state, and chambers of commerce—which would see great benefits from unification—opposed any war between Prussia and Austria. They believed any such conflict would only <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> of royal dynasties. Their own interests, which they understood as [...] "civil" [...] or [...] "bourgeois", seemed irrelevant. Public opinion also opposed Prussian domination. Catholic populations along the Rhine—especially in such cosmopolitan regions as Cologne and in the heavily populated Ruhr Valley—continued to support Austria. By late spring, most important states opposed Berlin's effort to reorganize the German states by force. The Prussian cabinet saw German unity as an issue of power and a question of who had the strength and will to wield that power. Meanwhile, the liberals in the Frankfurt assembly saw German unity {{as a process of}} negotiation that would lead to the distribution of power among the many parties.|$|E
500|$|SP {{candidate}}s, such as New Jersey gubernatorial {{and senate}} candidate Greg Pason, have also emphasized immediate public service demands; these reforms include socializing the U.S. health care system, a steeply graduated income tax, universal rent control, and {{the elimination of}} all educational debts and tuition fees. In 1997, Pason called auto insurance [...] "a regressive tax against working people". Moore was also vocal of his support for public healthcare and socialized medicine. Moore believes that capitalism is a system based on both exploitation and selfishness, which operates to <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> of corporations and the ruling class, at the expense of workers and the poor. During his presidential campaign he claimed that the lack of available remedy to collapsing economic conditions stems from the capitalist system's foundation upon [...] "greed", and advocated its replacement with a new system founded upon economic democracy through social ownership and workers' control of our reigning industrial and financial institutions.|$|E
