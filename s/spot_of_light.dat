5|$|If a {{laser beam}} is swept quickly across a distant object, the <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> can move faster thanc, {{although}} the initial movement of the spot is delayed {{because of the time}} it takes light to get to the distant object at the speedc. However, the only physical entities that are moving are the laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speedc from the laser to the various positions of the spot. Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object can be made to move faster thanc, after a delay in time. In neither case does any matter, energy, or information travel faster than light.|$|E

Researchers at Delft University in the Netherlands created the lightspot operated typewriter (LOT) in 1970, which made use of small movements of the head to point a small <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> at a matrix of characters, each equipped with a photoelectric cell.

2500|$|By the 1920s, when {{amplification}} made television practical, Scottish inventor John Logie Baird {{employed the}} Nipkow disk in his prototype video systems. He created his prototype {{in a little}} village called Santa Cruz {{on the island of}} Trinidad where he was recovering from an illness. He had also started work on the first color television. On March 25, 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised silhouette images in motion, at Selfridge's Department Store in London. Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a talking, moving ventriloquist's dummy named [...] "Stooky Bill", whose painted face had higher contrast. By January 26, 1926 he demonstrated the transmission of an image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as the first television demonstration in history. The subject was Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A bright light shining through a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses projected a bright <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> that swept across the subject. A selenium photoelectric tube detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal. This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one scan line of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face.|$|E

60|$|This was {{an appeal}} {{that could not}} be neglected, since {{hitherto}} the Sisa had been a <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in a dark place, as most of the surrounding peoples, who were of the old Zulu stock, remained heathen.

50|$|The process {{consisted}} of first exploring the object, {{the image of}} which is to be transmitted, with a <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> red <b>light,</b> next with a <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> green <b>light,</b> and finally with a <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> blue <b>light.</b> At the receiving station a similar process is employed, red, blue and green images being presented in rapid success to the eye. The apparatus used at the transmitter consists of a disc perforated with three successive spiral curves of holes. The holes in the first spiral are covered with red filters, in the second with green filters and in the third with blue. Light is projected through these holes and an image of the moving holes is projected onto the object. The disc revolves at 10 revolutions per second and so thirty complete images are transmitted every second — ten blue, ten red, and ten green.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Jerome Lettvin {{and his colleagues}} began to expand the feature {{detection}} hypothesis and clarify the relationship between single neurons and sensory perception. In their paper [...] "What the Frog's Eye Tells the Frog's Brain", Lettvin et al. (1959) looked beyond the mechanisms for signal-noise discrimination in the frog's retina {{and were able to}} identify four classes of ganglion cells in the frog retina: sustained contrast detectors, net convexity detectors (or bug detectors), moving edge detectors, and net dimming detectors. [...] In the same year, David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel began investigating properties of neurons in the visual cortex of cats, processing in the mammalian visual system. In their first paper in 1959, Hubel and Wiesel took recording from single cells in the striate cortex of lightly anesthetized cats. The retinas of the cats were stimulated either individually or simultaneously with <b>spots</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> various sizes and shapes. From the analysis of these recordings, Hubel and Wiesel identified orientation-selective cells in the cat's visual cortex and generated a map of the receptive field of cortical cells. At the time, circular <b>spots</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> were used as stimuli in studies of the visual cortex. However, Hubel and Wiesel noticed that rectangular bars <b>of</b> <b>light</b> were more effective stimuli (i.e. more natural stimuli) than circular <b>spots</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> as long as the orientation was adjusted to the correct angle appropriate for each ganglion cell. These so-called simple cells were later called bar detectors or edge detectors. While comparing the receptive fields of neurons in the cat striate cortex with the concentric [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off" [...] receptive fields identified in cat ganglion cells by Kuffler et al., Hubel and Wiesel noticed that, although [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off" [...] regions were present in the striate cortex, they were not arranged in concentric circles. From their discovery of these uniquely orienting receptive fields, Hubel and Wiesel concluded that orientation-selective cells exist within the cat's visual cortex.|$|R

60|$|It is {{for this}} reason that an object, viewed with both eyes, is seen single and not double. Two {{distinct}} images are formed, but each image is referred to that point at which the two optic axes intersect; consequently, the two images exactly cover one another, and appear as completely one as any other two exactly similar superimposed images would be.
