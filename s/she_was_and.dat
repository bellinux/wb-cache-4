5|$|Albert and Victoria {{chose the}} names Louisa Caroline Alberta. She was baptized on 13 May 1848 in Buckingham Palace's private chapel by John Bird Sumner, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Though she was christened Louisa at the service, she was {{invariably}} known as Louise throughout her life. Her godparents were Duke Gustav of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (her paternal great-great-uncle, for whom Prince Albert stood proxy); the Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen (for whom her great-aunt Queen Adelaide stood proxy); and the Hereditary Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (her first cousin once-removed, {{for whom the}} Duchess of Cambridge stood proxy). During the ceremony, the Duchess of Gloucester, {{one of the few}} children of King George III who was still alive, forgot where <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> <b>and</b> suddenly got {{up in the middle of}} the service and knelt at the Queen's feet, much to the Queen's horror.|$|E
5|$|The hearing {{began with}} the {{swearing-in}} of the jury and introductions from various legal representatives, including a lawyer hired for Lucan by his mother. Thurston introduced the jury to the case and explained their duties. He had selected 33witnesses to be called over the following few days, including Veronica Lucan, who each day wore a dark coat and white headscarf. Thurston questioned her on her relationship with Lucan, her marriage, her financial affairs, her employment of Rivett and what had happened {{on the night of}} the attack. The Dowager Countess's Queen's Counsel attempted to ask Lady Lucan about the nature of their relationship, if she hated her husband, but Thurston ruled his line of questioning inadmissible. Woman Detective Constable Sally Blower, who had taken a statement from Frances on 20November 1974, read the young girl's words to the court. Frances had heard a scream, and a few minutes later had watched as her mother (blood on her face) and father had entered the room. Her mother had then sent her to bed. She later heard her father calling for her mother, asking where <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> <b>and</b> watched as he left the bathroom and walked downstairs. She also described how Sandra Rivett did not normally work on Thursday nights.|$|E
5|$|Angela and Serah {{then headed}} to Castle Caldecote in Cumberland {{as it was}} the {{whereabouts}} of the third Faustian. Her name was Anna Maria, the natural daughter of a bishop that was kept safe by Master Coulson in one of the castle's room as instructed by her father. However, in the last new moon, she managed to escape the castle and returned somewhat different. Seeing the girl was not mad as Coulson said she was, Serah demanded the girl to be freed from her chains and told Angela {{to keep an eye on}} her. As the days passed, Serah, who had been studying about the Faerie, discovered that the Enchantress sends a sliver of herself into each of those with whom she struck a deal and that she was using stories, such as that of her victims and Christopher Marlowe's play, to expand her power. Upon figuring it out, Serah started to devise a plan to counter that of Enchantress. Meanwhile, Angela struck a deal with Anna Maria: in exchange for a way to free her, she would tell Angela the truth about herself. The girl then told her she was born Witchbreed and that she eventually learned her touch was death. When the path to the Faerie was open, she took the opportunity to become something other than what <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> <b>and</b> willingly struck a deal with the Enchantress and became a Faustian. Later that night, Angela heard strange noises coming from Anna Maria's room and went to check if everything was right. There she found the girl crying, frightened by the Enchantress' voice inside her head. The girl asked Angela to tell her a story to calm her down, and so she did, but it was in vain as the Enchantress took control of the girl's body and attacked Angela. The girl managed to regain consciousness though and in an attempt to be free again, used Angela's weapon to kill herself. Serah showed up and was able to revive the girl, who was a Faustian no more. As she hadn't died, Serah thought she was safe from the Enchantress' wrath, but she was wrong as the Faerie rose from the blood of her lost Faustian and took Serah's life, fulfilling her menace. With the sun setting, Angela burned her lover's body to the ashes, recovering her skull and singing to it afterwards. Suddenly to Angela's surprise, the skull became animated and started to talk with her.|$|E

The khan of Shiraz' favourite, who still wanted to marry Teresia, sent his servants to the Carmelites in Isfahan to capture her. The priests denied knowing where <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> <b>and</b> advised her to take refuge in the Church of Saint Augustine in New Julfa (the Armenian quarter in Isfahan); they were brought to the favourite's house and threatened with torture before they were released.|$|E

Turambar mortally wounded Glaurung with Gurthang, but was hurt by the venom of the Dragon's blood and fell in a swoon. When Níniel came to search for him, Glaurung with his last words undid his spell, and she remembered who <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>and</b> realized that Turambar was her brother.

25|$|After her marriage, Dolores {{adopted the}} severe {{masculine}} style of dress and hair popular at that time, appearing in Eve, The Lady's Pictorial in 1925 {{in a suit}} jacket and tie. The mannish appearance, uncharacteristic (in photographs) half-smile, and the knowing look in the picture has caused later commentators to wonder whether Dolores was signalling {{that she was a}} lesbian, but {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>and</b> her appearance at this time may simply have been a fashion statement. The photograph appeared, slightly changed, on the cover of Fashioning Sapphism: The Origins of a Modern English Lesbian Culture by Laura Doan in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Further {{straining}} the Cory {{family was}} {{the arrival of}} Mac's illegitimate son, Sandy Alexander (Christopher Rich). Jamie (now played by Richard Bekins) and Sandy formed a brotherly relationship, but it was damaged when Jamie's scheming wife, Cecile (Nancy Frangione), and Sandy had an affair. Cecile and Sandy married and had a daughter named Maggie (Nicole Schrink). Sandy left Cecile when he realized what kind of woman <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>and</b> started a relationship with Blaine.

25|$|Derace Kingsley, {{a wealthy}} businessman, hires Marlowe {{to find his}} estranged wife, Crystal. Although {{separated}} from his wife, Kingsley fears that Crystal— rich, pretty, spoiled and reckless—may have become involved in a scandal that could jeopardise his position with the shareholders of the company {{of which he is}} an executive. The last definite place Crystal was known to have been was their vacation cabin on Little Fawn Lake. Kingsley had received a telegram from Crystal about two weeks before (dateline El Paso, Texas) stating that she was divorcing him and marrying her gigolo boyfriend, Chris Lavery. But when Kingsley ran into Lavery in L.A. and asked him where Crystal was, Lavery told him that he hadn't seen her, wasn't with her in El Paso, didn't know where <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> <b>and</b> never agreed, or wanted, to marry her.|$|E
25|$|Queen Sophia Magdalena {{was of a}} shy and {{reserved}} character and was never {{a member of the}} King's inner circle. At the famous amateur court theater of Gustav III, Sophia Magdalena is occasionally named as participator in the documents: in 1777, for example she dressed as an Italian sailor and participated in a battle between Italian and Spanish sailors. Normally, however, it was rather her role to act as the passive lady of games and tournaments, and to decorate the winner with the award. She did her ceremonial duties, but disliked the vivid lifestyle of the Court around her outgoing spouse. As Queen, she was expected to do a great deal of representation, more than had been expected from previous queens because of her consort's love for representation. On formal occasions, she was at her best: she performed beautifully according to Court etiquette, and was seen as dignified and impressive. On 17 September 1784, for example, she cut the cord to let off the first air balloons from the Stockholm observatory. During the King's Italian journey in 1783–84, she hosted a grand formal public dinner every two weeks, court presentation and showed herself at the Royal Swedish Opera and at the French Theater, but otherwise preferred her solitude. This attracted attention as during the absence of the King, she had been expected to represent the royal couple all the more. During this time, she is said to have enjoyed nature trips in the country side, with only one lady in waiting and two footmen, but this was stopped, because it was deemed unsuitable. Several of her ladies-in-waiting were well known Swedish women of the era, among them The Three Graces, as Augusta von Fersen, Ulla von Höpken and Lovisa Meijerfelt were called, and the artists Marianne Ehrenström and Charlotta Cedercreutz. Sophia Magdalena was a popular Queen: the 22 July 1788, for example, during the absence of her spouse in Finland, several members of the Royal Dramatic Theater and the musical society Augustibröder, among them Bellman, took a spontaneous trip by boat from the capital to Ulriksdal Palace, where <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> <b>and</b> performed a poem by Bellman to her honor at the occasion of her name day.|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} and only time in Angelou's series, she repeats the same episode in detail—her son's {{automobile}} accident—at the end of her fourth autobiography The Heart of a Woman and the beginning of this one, a technique that both centralizes each installment and connects each book in the series with each other. [...] Additionally, each volume [...] "ends with abrupt suspense". [...] It also creates a strong and emotional link between the two autobiographies.

500|$|... "Rebel Heart" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Pettifer wrote: [...] "The last {{song on the}} album feels like the first to properly spring into aural life in an unapologetically major key [...] The song relates the story of its singer— who <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>and</b> how she became who she is– which is really the record's underlying conceit". Pettifer also wrote that the lyrics were [...] "more auto-biographical and therefore more interesting". Bradley Stern, an editor and publisher for MuuMuse, also praised the song's autobiographical lyrics; [...] "The message is sincere, vulnerable and undoubtedly true to Madonna’s story, the music is strong and that chorus is utterly anthemic. Madonna hasn’t had a truly rich, singer-songwriter, sing-along friendly record in a while— maybe since Music?— so it's kind of unbelievable to hear such a strong melody from the Queen again". He called it [...] "one of her best songs in a long time". Stern preferred the leaked demo over the final original version.|$|E
500|$|Artist Alex Ross and writer/producer Paul Dini made {{attempts}} {{to return the}} character to her original conception. Ross explained {{in an interview that}} he and Dini had planned to restore her mobility by placing her in a Lazarus Pit, a naturally occurring chemical pool in the DC Universe that has rejuvenating effects when a person is submerged within it. He stated that [...] "we pitched then-Batman editor Denny O'Neil with these drawings of that costume design. The idea of using the red instead of the traditional yellow was meant to invoke the idea that coming from the Lazarus Pit, she was in a way, more compromised as a character... Denny shot it down, because, according to him, everybody loves Barbara Gordon as Oracle and as a handicapped character. The theory was that DC didn't have enough handicapped characters, so they weren't going to do anything with Barbara as <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> <b>And</b> the design went into the drawer." [...] Kate Kane, the modern Batwoman introduced during 52, wears a variation of what would have been Gordon's new Batgirl costume designed by Ross.|$|E
