6000|$|... 'Is Billy boy dead?' <b>She</b> <b>nods.</b> 'Was {{he killed}} in action? Tell me, tell me!' <b>She</b> <b>nods</b> again. 'Good for Billy boy. I knew Billy boy was all right. Don't cry, Ellen. I'll {{take care of}} you. All's well with Billy boy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nothing but blank paper! Is {{this your}} writing in pencil on the envelope?' <b>She</b> <b>nods,</b> {{and he gives}} the matter further consideration.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then Mr. Wahrfield {{handed her}} a string of foreign dialect, and <b>she</b> <b>nods</b> her head and says, 'See, señor,' maybe fifty times, and lights out with the note.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Burrows, is it?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> her head. [...] "She is {{the mother}} of the man they call the Grinder?" [...] Again <b>she</b> <b>nodded</b> her head. [...] "It is he whom they accuse of the murder?" [...] Yet again <b>she</b> <b>nodded</b> her head. [...] "There was another man?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> it again. [...] "And they say that there was a third," [...] he said,--"your brother Sam." ...|$|R
30|$|Some minutes later, MI {{was asked}} if she liked the communicator. <b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> her head affirmatively. MI {{was asked if}} {{she would like to}} use it again, and <b>she</b> <b>nodded</b> affirmatively again.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded.</b> <b>She</b> {{scarcely}} showed so {{much interest}} {{as he would}} have liked.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>nods</b> {{her head}} again, {{and after a}} short silence, quaintly bursts out with: ‘You know we must be married, and married from here, Eddy, or the poor girls will be so dreadfully disappointed!’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... (She takes Eileen {{aside and}} talks to her in low tones of [...] admonition. Eileen's face falls. <b>She</b> <b>nods</b> a horrified [...] acquiescence. Miss Gilpin leaves her and goes into the office, [...] rear.) ...|$|E
60|$|MORELL (turning from him). I shall {{want you}} to take some notes at the meeting, Miss Garnett, if you have no other engagement. (<b>She</b> <b>nods,</b> afraid to speak.) You are coming, Lexy, I suppose.|$|E
60|$|After each {{question}} he paused, while <b>she</b> <b>nodded</b> an affirmation.|$|R
60|$|The girl, oddly, {{understood}} him. <b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> her head, affirmatively.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> again wonderingly. Then {{she caught}} his hand appealingly.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>nods</b> {{her head}} gravely, {{goes to the}} door of OLIVE'S room, [...] opens it gently, stands looking for a-moment, then with the [...] words [...] "My Lamb!" [...] she goes in noiselessly and closes the door.|$|E
60|$|PHILIP. Sh! Attention. (They put {{on their}} best manners. Philip adds in a lower voice to Gloria) If he's {{good enough for the}} lunch, I'll nod to Dolly; and if <b>she</b> <b>nods</b> to you, invite him {{straight}} away.|$|E
6000|$|The Lady, {{coming back}} to him: [...] "No; it must be roses, after all. I see that nothing else will do. What do you call those?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>nods</b> at a vase of roses on a shelf behind him.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> again, with {{a return}} of her usual sweet composure.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded,</b> {{an angry}} {{reminiscent}} flash in her eyes, and waited.|$|R
60|$|He {{paused for}} a contradiction, but <b>she</b> <b>nodded</b> her head in agreement.|$|R
6000|$|Hippona lets no silly flush [...] Disturb her cheek, nought {{makes her}} blush. [...] Whate'er obscenities you say, [...] <b>She</b> <b>nods</b> and titters frank and gay. [...] Oh Shame, awake one honest flush [...] For this,--that nothing makes her blush.|$|E
60|$|PHILIP (maturely). No, Dolly: my {{knowledge}} of human nature confirms Mr. Valentine's judgment. He is right. Let me introduce Miss Dorothy Clandon, commonly called Dolly. (Valentine bows to Dolly. <b>She</b> <b>nods</b> to him.) I'm Philip Clandon. We're from Madeira, but perfectly respectable, so far.|$|E
6000|$|MURRAY (instantly {{struck by}} this suggestion). You mean--I could write--up here? (<b>She</b> <b>nods.</b> His face lights up with enthusiasm.) Say! That is an idea! Thank you! I'd {{never have had}} sense enough to have thought of that myself. (Eileen flushes with pleasure.) Sure there's time--nothing but time up here---- ...|$|E
60|$|I drew {{a little}} closer to her. <b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> again several times.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> sympathetically. They were {{on their}} way down the broad staircase.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded,</b> and on they rushed, the ever-freshening gale {{on their}} beam.|$|R
6000|$|... (Knox accompanies her silently to {{the door}} and places hand on knob.) I wish I had {{something}} of you to have with me always--a photograph, that little one, you remember, which I liked so. (<b>She</b> <b>nods.)</b> Don't run the risk of sending it by messenger. Just mail it ordinarily.|$|E
6000|$|CRAMPTON (angry). What! (Her odd {{expression}} {{does not}} alter. He surrenders.) Well, yes, my dear: I suppose it is, I suppose it is. (<b>She</b> <b>nods</b> sympathetically.) I'm afraid I'm sometimes a little irritable; but I know what's right and reasonable all the time, even when I don't act on it. Can you believe that? ...|$|E
6000|$|Dame Fairy <b>she</b> <b>nods,</b> {{and cries}} clear and sweet, [...] "'Tis a very good-e'en, sir, when such folks meet. [...] I know thee, Sam, thou though wist not of me, [...] And I'm come in late gloaming {{to speak with}} thee; [...] Though my eyes do dazzle at glint of your rush, [...] All under this pretty green fuchsia bush." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded,</b> with {{an attempt}} at {{brightness}} which was a little pitiful.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded.</b> A {{faint smile}} of {{bitterness}} had stolen into her tone.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} at her sharply. <b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> slowly, like a {{porcelain}} mandarin.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The covey told me {{you were}} a charwoman; so I suppose you picked the {{envelopes}} out of waste-paper baskets, or such like, and then changed the addresses?' <b>She</b> <b>nods</b> again; still she dare not look up, but she is admiring his legs. When, however, he would cast the letters into the fire, she flames up with sudden spirit. She clutches them.|$|E
6000|$|McCOMAS. Bless me! And you {{are still}} ready to make speeches in public, in spite of your sex (Mrs. Clandon nods); to insist on a married woman's right to her own {{separate}} property (<b>she</b> <b>nods</b> again); to champion Darwin's view {{of the origin of}} species and John Stuart Mill's essay on Liberty (nod); to read Huxley, Tyndall and George Eliot (three nods); and to demand University degrees, the opening of the professions, and the parliamentary franchise for women as well as men? ...|$|E
6000|$|Since then, when {{my views}} {{have been called}} for I have kept my real sentiments more to myself like, preferring to express {{unbounded}} admiration of this young person's actions, irrespective of their actual merits. And <b>she</b> <b>nods</b> her head approvingly and trots off to advertise my opinion {{to the rest of}} the household. She appears to employ it as a sort of testimonial for mercenary purposes, for I subsequently hear distant sounds of [...] "Unkie says me dood dirl--me dot to have two bikkies [biscuits]." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded</b> {{and replied}} that doubtless the symbol {{had come down}} to them.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded,</b> and {{commenced}} to dry {{her eyes}} with a little lace handkerchief.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>nodded,</b> and, going forward, {{threw open}} a door, {{inviting}} him to enter.|$|R
