5|$|The {{heart of}} the Fabry–Pérot {{interferometer}} {{is a pair of}} partially silvered glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot etalon uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse <b>source</b> <b>set</b> at the focal plane of a collimating lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. {{in the absence of the}} paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A'. In Fig.6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig.6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.|$|E

40|$|A privacy utility {{tradeoff}} {{is developed}} for any arbitrary <b>set</b> of finite-alphabet <b>source</b> distributions. Privacy is quantified using differential privacy (DP), and utility is quantified using expected Hamming distortion maximized over {{the set of}} distributions. The family of <b>source</b> distribution <b>sets</b> (<b>source</b> <b>sets)</b> is categorized into three classes, based on different levels of prior knowledge they capture: (i) for Class I <b>source</b> <b>sets,</b> defined as sets whose convex hull includes the uniform point, the optimal DP mechanism is shown to be symmetric; (ii) for Class II <b>source</b> <b>sets,</b> comprised of distributions {{that are not in}} Class I and are restricted to have an order imposed on the distribution, the optimal mechanism is shown to exploit the source knowledge to provide more privacy to the outliers; and (iii) for all remaining <b>source</b> <b>sets,</b> which are neither Class I nor Class II, henceforth defined as Class III, bounds on optimal leakage are developed; these bounds are shown to be tight for Class III sets satisfying a specific property. To get a better understanding of DP under Hamming distortion, numerical comparisons to information theoretic leakage is provided, and analytical comparisons are developed for specific distortion ranges.

40|$|Stateless model {{checking}} is {{a powerful}} technique for program verification, which however suffers from an exponential {{growth in the number}} of explored executions. A successful technique for reducing this number, while still maintaining complete coverage, is Dynamic Partial Order Reduction (DPOR). We present a new DPOR algorithm, which is the first to be provably optimal in that it always explores the minimal number of executions. It is based on a novel class of <b>sets,</b> called <b>source</b> <b>sets,</b> which replace the role of persistent sets in previous algorithms. First, we show how to modify an existing DPOR algorithm to work with <b>source</b> <b>sets,</b> resulting in an efficient and simple to implement algorithm. Second, we extend this algorithm with a novel mechanism, called wakeup trees, that allows to achieve optimality. We have implemented both algorithms in a stateless model checking tool for Erlang programs. Experiments show that <b>source</b> <b>sets</b> significantly increase the performance and that wakeup trees incur only a small overhead in both time and space...|$|R
