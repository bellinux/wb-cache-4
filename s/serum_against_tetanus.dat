50|$|The {{company was}} granted {{the status of}} a {{scientific}} research institute on April 9, 1947. The institute was renamed VEB Serum-Werk Dessau on January 1, 1951, and was a key vaccine and medication manufacturer for veterinary and human vaccines in the GDR. Following a decision by the GDR Council of Ministers (1950-1954), Serum-Werk Dessau was assigned directly to the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry on July 1, 1953. On January 1, 1954, the production-oriented VEB Serum-Werk Dessau became the science-oriented Forschungsinstitut für Impfstoffe Dessau. The Institute was mandated to produce vaccines for all major infectious animal diseases, for the GDR and for export. In the field of human medicine, new or improved preparations were developed, such as tuberculin and <b>serums</b> <b>against</b> <b>tetanus</b> and diphtheria. On January 23, 1973, Wilfried Heinicke, former director of the veterinary department of the Agriculture, Forestry and Food Products Ministry, became the new director of the Institute. While the Forschungsinstitut für Impfstoffe primarily focused on basic and applied research and the development of vaccines, serums and diagnostic methods for veterinary and human medicine during the years from 1954 to 1973, now exploration of the immunological foundations of bacterial animal diseases, applied vaccine research and also research on vaccine production technology intensified. In 1985 the Institut für Impfstoffe Dessau had close to 1,500 employees.|$|R

Early measures for improving hygiene conditions were introduced during the cholera epidemic of 1884 – 85 (Forti Messina 1984). These measures, which encouraged Italians to wash hands and boil water, almost eliminated the disease from Italy. Furthermore, these measures were probably responsible for the reduction in the incidence of typhoid fever (Faccini 1984; Tognotti 2008). In 1888, the smallpox vaccine was made compulsory with the “Crispi-Pagliani” law (Tucci 1984).

40|$|Tetanus toxin is {{a potent}} neurotoxin {{synthesized}} by Clostridium tetani. Immunization with fragment C protein, the nontoxic C-terminal domain of tetanus toxin, will protect mice against lethal challenge with tetanus toxin. A synthetic gene encoding fragment C (tetC) had previously been shown to express high levels of fragment C in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A plasmid, pcDNA 3 /tetC, which encodes the synthetic tetC gene expressed {{under the control of}} the human cytomegalovirus major intermediate-early promoter/enhancer region, was constructed. Expression of fragment C was observed in eukaryotic cells growing in vitro following transfection with pcDNA 3 /tetC. The immune response induced by intramuscular immunization with pure pcDNA 3 /tetC DNA was evaluated in a murine model. Anti-fragment C serum immunoglobulin and proliferative responses in splenocytes were observed in BALB/c mice following two immunizations with pcDNA 3 /tetC. The major immunoglobulin G subclass that recognized fragment C was immunoglobulin G 2 a, and the stimulated splenocytes secreted high levels of gamma interferon.

Fort Alexander's isolation led the Commission to establish a new research laboratory there in January 1897. This laboratory was a part of Imperial Institute of Experimental Medicine (now Institute of Experimental Medicine of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences). Fort Alexander was renovated for the new purpose in 1897-1899, largely with funds from Duke Alexander Petrovich of Oldenburg, and featured a science library, research labs including containment labs, a stable for laboratory horses, cremation facility for lab animals, and other auxiliary facilities. Research work in Fort Alexander took off in August 1899 and was mainly focused on the study of plague disease and preparation of plague serum and vaccine from the immunized horses. In the following years, the laboratory is reported to have worked also on the development of <b>serums</b> <b>against</b> cholera, <b>tetanus,</b> typhus, scarlatina, and a series of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus infections. Work was hazardous and there were three pneumonic and bubonic plague cases among the staff members in 1904 and 1907 resulting in two fatalities. After the Communist takeover in 1917, the laboratory in Fort Alexander ceased operations. Research assets were transferred to various institutes in Petrograd, Moscow, and Saratov.|$|R

We also studied protection in both groups 5 years after vaccination. We compared antibody titers at all three time points and also analyzed the T cell responses in both age groups 5 years after vaccination. Before vaccination 9 % of the elderly persons were not protected <b>against</b> <b>tetanus,</b> and 48 % did not have protection against diphtheria. In the young group all participants were protected <b>against</b> <b>tetanus,</b> but 52 % were also unprotected against diphtheria before vaccination. 28 days after vaccination 100 % of all participants had protective antibody concentrations <b>against</b> <b>tetanus</b> and only a small percentage in each age group (< 10 %) was unprotected against diphtheria. 5 years later, 100 % of both cohorts were still protected <b>against</b> <b>tetanus,</b> but 24 % of the young and 54 % of the elderly group were unprotected against diphtheria.

Currently many older persons have been vaccinated against selected pathogens during childhood but lack regular booster immunizations. The impact of regular vaccinations when started late in life was analyzed in an open, explorative trial by evaluating the immune response <b>against</b> <b>tetanus</b> and diphtheria in healthy older individuals. 252 persons aged above 60 years received a booster vaccination <b>against</b> <b>tetanus,</b> diphtheria, pertussis and polio and a subcohort (n= 87) was recruited to receive a second booster vaccination <b>against</b> <b>tetanus,</b> diphtheria and pertussis 5 years later. The percentage of unprotected individuals at the time of enrollment differed substantially for tetanus (12 %) and diphtheria (65 %). Despite protective antibody concentrations 4 weeks after the first vaccination in almost all vaccinees, antibodies had again dropped below protective levels in 10 % (tetanus) and 45 % (diphtheria) of the cohort after 5 years. Protection was restored in almost all vaccinees after the second vaccination. No correlation between tetanus- and diphtheria-specific responses was observed, and antibody concentrations were not associated with age-related changes in the T cell repertoire, inflammatory parameters, or CMV-seropositivity suggesting that there was no general biological "non-responder type. " Post-vaccination antibody concentrations depended on pre-existing plasma cells and B cell memory as indicated by a strong positive relationship between post-vaccination antibodies and pre-vaccination antibodies as well as antibody-secreting cells. In contrast, antigen-specific T cell responses were not or only weakly associated with antibody concentrations. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that single shot vaccinations <b>against</b> <b>tetanus</b> and/or diphtheria do not lead to long-lasting immunity in many elderly persons despite administration at relatively short intervals.

40|$|SUMMARY Treatment of {{malignancies}} with {{cytotoxic chemotherapy}} and/or bone marrow or stem cell transplantation also suppress {{the immune system}} which becomes incapable of controlling infections. Therefore infections can remain a serious problem {{for an extended period}} in these patients. The aims of these studies was to assess the immunological status <b>against</b> <b>tetanus</b> and pneumococci and the need of revaccinations. It was hypothesized that the immunity of the donor replaces the immunity of the patient after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). However, recipients of allogeneic marrow grafts frequently lost pretransplant immunity <b>against</b> <b>tetanus</b> after transplantation. After reimmunization with tetanus toxoid all patients responded with an adequate antibody production. Our further studies have shown similar findings in recipients of autologous grafts; the tetanus. immunity was defective both after autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) and autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation (APBSCT). None of the patients who were seronegative seroconverted spontaneously without vaccination. Also patients treated for hematological malignancies with cytotoxic chemotherapy were in a high frequency unprotected <b>against</b> <b>tetanus.</b> The risk factors for loss of immunity <b>against</b> <b>tetanus</b> were increasing age, lymphoid malignancy and advanced disease stage. All these patient groups can therefore benefit from tetanus vaccination; a three dose immunization schedule was superior to obtain a long -lasting imrnunity. Serologic studies of pneumococcal immunity showed that ABMT recipients retained pretransplant immunity, while it was lost in BMT patients. Immunization with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was effective in BMT patients without chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), while patients with chronic GVHD responded with an immature antibody pattem or did not respond at all. The poor antigenicity of the polysaccharide based vaccines was noted previously in immunocompromised patients. Therefore vaccines with polysaccharide conjugated to peptide were developed. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine seems to eli t better immune response than polysaccharide vaccine in BMT patients with chronic GVHD. The immune system matures slowly after transplantation and the patients have usually nommalized levels of immunoglobulins within one year. The specific immunity is defective in immunocompromised patients and there is no correlation between levels of specific antibodies and total immunoglobulin levels...|$|R

Blood IgG antibody levels to tetanus was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the laboratory and TQS (an immunochromatogrphic test) at the bedside for 304 children admitted into emergency unit of a tertiary hospital in Ibadan Nigeria. Demographic information and vaccination history were also collected. TQS results were compared with anti-tetanus antibody measured by ELISA using seroprotection cut-off of 0. 1 IU/ml. Seroprevalence of protective level of immunity <b>against</b> <b>tetanus</b> using ELISA and TQS methods was 44. 7 % and 45. 4 % respectively. Protective level of immunity increased as age increases. Of the seven potential factors assessed, male gender and being second or more position among mother’s children were independent predictors of non-protective level of immunity. Absence of history of recent tetanus toxoid injection {{was significantly associated with}} non-protective level of immunity in univariate analysis but not logistic regression model. The agreement between the ELISA and the TQS results was good with a k coefficient of 0. 931. TQS sensitivity was, 95. 7 %, specificity 97. 6 %, positive predictive value 98. 0 % and negative predictive values 96. 0 %. This study showed that lack of protective immunity <b>against</b> <b>tetanus</b> is common; few demographic characteristics correctly predict non-protection and IgG antibody levels to tetanus was accurately detected by TQS...|$|R
