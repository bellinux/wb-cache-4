40|$|Two {{composites}} (steel/CuAl 9 Ni 3 Fe 2), (steel/CuZn 40 Al 12) {{have been}} produced whose corrosion resistance and reversed bending fatigue strength are markedly superior {{to those of the}} conventional steel/CuPb 10 Sn 10 composite material. The two materials systems have been used to produce components (<b>small</b> <b>end</b> bearing <b>bushes)</b> which have undergone testing with regard to their wear behavior and alternating load resistance in an engine which is in operation. Loads of approximately 150 MPa did not cause fatigue failure in either material. The CuAl 9 Ni 3 Fe 2 system exhibited better wear resistance than the CuZn 40 Al 12 system. The project has {{led to the development of}} two new composite materials which have proven their potential in engine trials under high loads. More development work is required in relation to processing reliability and stability in the production of the composite multilayer material. (orig.)

40|$|Having in mind con-rods for {{motorbike}} and car engines, and {{spurred by}} the disagreements evidenced in the pertinent literature, the maximum circumferential stresses within the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> are investigated analytically, photoelastically, and numerically. The analytical models are based upon a plane assumption, and they adopt both beam and theory of elasticity idealizations. The plane photoelastic study concentrates on <b>small</b> <b>ends</b> with outer to inner radii ratios ranging from 1. 2 to 1. 5. A plane numerical model aimed at thoroughly mimicking the pin ovalization is developed, and a design chart of the peak hoop stress within the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> is provided for {{a wide spectrum of}} <b>small</b> <b>end</b> and pin geometries, for zero initial clearance. Such diagrams allow a prompt preliminary dimensioning of the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> to be carried out, which may be refined by effecting a three-dimensional finite element study of the specific conrod geometry. The consequences of an initial clearance between <b>small</b> <b>end</b> bore and gudgeon pin are examined for selected geometries, and three-dimensional aspects are explored for specific con-rod shapes...|$|R
50|$|In the {{semi-floating}} configuration, the pin {{is usually}} fixed {{relative to the}} piston by an interference fit with the journal in the piston. (This replaced the earlier set screw method.) The connecting rod <b>small</b> <b>end</b> bearing thus acts as the bearing alone. In this configuration, only the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> bearing requires a bearing surface, if any. If needed, this is provided by either electroplating the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> bearing journal with a suitable metal, or more usually by inserting a sleeve bearing or needle bearing into {{the eye of the}} <b>small</b> <b>end,</b> which has an interference fit with the aperture of the <b>small</b> <b>end.</b> During overhaul, it is usually possible to replace this bearing sleeve if it is badly worn. The reverse configuration, fixing the gudgeon pin to the connecting rod instead of to the piston, is implemented using an interference fit with the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> eye instead, with the gudgeon pin journals in the piston functioning as bearings. This arrangement is usually more difficult to manufacture and service because two bearing surfaces or inserted sleeves complicate the design. In addition, the pin must be precisely set so that the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> eye is central. Because of thermal expansion considerations, this arrangement was more usual for single-cylinder engines as opposed to multiple cylinder engines with long cylinder blocks and crankcases, until precision manufacturing became more commonplace.|$|R

40|$|Keywords：pipe elbows; {{reducing}} elbows; elastic stress; in–plane close-bending moment; limit close-bending moment Abstract：Elastic {{stresses and}} limit close-bending moments of reducing elbows subject to in–plane close-bending moments were validated by limit element analysis (LMA) and testing. Results of LMA show {{that if the}} end bend moment M acts on <b>small</b> <b>end</b> while the large end is fixed, the largest movement acts on neutral line near the larger end, and large circumferential stress lies on inside surface near neutral lines but deflect to intrados of large end. For the same model, if the end bend moment M acts on large <b>end</b> while the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> is fixed, the largest movement acts on near the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> and lies on neutral line, and larger stress acts on <b>small</b> <b>end</b> and nearby. Results of testing show that stress character in tension stress and compressive stresses {{are consistent with the}} calculation results from formula. The limit bending moment calculation results from formula of reducing elbow is conservative, but is consistent with the formula of the limit bending moment, which is controlled by <b>small</b> <b>end</b> of reducing elbow...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} effects of divergent selection and different positions of Japanese quail eggs in artificial incubation on hatchability, egg weight loss, chick weight. 300 Japanese quail (100 birds in each line) were used for egg collection. These lines have been selected for high (HW) and low (LW) body weight for 9 generations and compared with control line(C). Average of 822 eggs (274 eggs in each line) was 14. 19, 12. 02 and 10. 2 in HW, C and LW, respectively, all at 13 weeks of age. Based on eggs positions during incubation were divided into two experimental groups (137 eggs in each group in each line: vertical position with <b>small</b> <b>end</b> up, vertical position with <b>small</b> <b>end</b> down with turning). The eggs incubated in vertical and <b>small</b> <b>end</b> down had the higher hatchability (59. 2 %), while those incubated in vertical position with <b>small</b> <b>end</b> up presented the lower hatchability (8. 5 %). Egg position influenced water loss during incubation. The groups with better hatchability presented lower egg weight loss and better hatch weight.
