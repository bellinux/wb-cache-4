5|$|The thyroid is {{supplied}} with arterial {{blood from the}} <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery,</b> {{a branch of the}} external carotid artery, and the inferior thyroid artery, a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, and sometimes by an anatomical variant the thyroid ima artery, which has a variable origin. The <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> splits into anterior and posterior branches supplying the thyroid, and the inferior thyroid artery splits into superior and inferior branches. The superior and inferior thyroid arteries join together behind the outer part of the thyroid lobes. The venous blood is drained via superior and middle thyroid veins, which drain to the internal jugular vein, and via the inferior thyroid veins. The inferior thyroid veins originate in a network of veins and drain into the left and right brachiocephalic veins. Both arteries and veins form a plexus between the two layers of the capsule of the thyroid gland.|$|E
25|$|The common carotid usually {{gives off}} no branch {{previous}} to its bifurcation, but it occasionally gives origin to the <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> or its laryngeal branch, the ascending pharyngeal artery, the inferior thyroid artery, or, more rarely, the vertebral artery.|$|E
25|$|The arteries {{supplying}} the thymus are {{branches of the}} internal thoracic, and inferior thyroid arteries, with branches from the <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> sometimes seen. The branches reach the thymus and travel with the septa of the capsule into the area between the cortex and medulla, where they enter the thymus itself.|$|E
500|$|It differs in {{size and}} ranges from as small as {{accessory}} <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries</b> {{to the size of}} primary thyroid vessels. The diameter of the lumen of the artery ranges from [...] The artery may be present as an accessory <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> but sometimes appears to compensate for incompetence or absence of one or more main thyroid vessels. Since it begins from below the thyroid gland and ascends upwards, it is mostly associated with absence or reduced size of the inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries.</b> In such cases, it is known as the accessory inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery.</b> In rare cases, the artery has been seen to be compensating for absence of one or both <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries.</b>|$|R
25|$|The chief {{communications}} {{outside the}} skull take {{place between the}} <b>superior</b> and inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries,</b> and the deep cervical artery and the descending branch of the occipital artery; the vertebral artery {{takes the place of}} the internal carotid artery within the cranium.|$|R
30|$|The thyroid is an high vascularized gland which receive {{arterial}} {{blood from the}} <b>superior</b> and inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries.</b> Therefore a careful hemostasis is crucial {{in order to avoid}} some complications as hematomas and/or seromas that sometimes may cause a potentially lethal asphyxia (Rosato et al. 2004). The use of the conventional technique requires more time to perform an adequate haemostasis.|$|R
50|$|The arteries {{supplying}} the thymus {{are derived from}} the internal thoracic artery, and from the <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> and inferior thyroids.|$|E
50|$|The lingual artery {{arises from}} the {{external}} carotid between the <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> and facial artery. It can be located easily in the tongue.|$|E
50|$|The <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> {{arises from}} the {{external}} carotid artery just {{below the level of}} the greater cornu of the hyoid bone and ends in the thyroid gland.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} case of a 61 -year-old male patient with chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease and a large cervicomediastinal multinodular hyperfunctioning goiter that made thyroidectomy a daunting task, especially considering the risk of intraoperative bleeding. The preoperative computed tomographic (CT) scan showed the right thyroid lobe very deeply rooted in the mediastinum, below the horizontal plane passing through the aortic arch. The thyroid mass imprinted the arterious and venous innominate trunks. To avoid a median sternotomy and remove the enlarged thyroid through a cervical approach alone, we decided to reduce the goiter in volume preoperatively by embolizing the <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries.</b> We embolized the superior and inferior left, and the inferior right <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries.</b> We spared the <b>superior</b> right <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> because its blood supply contributed little to thyroid perfusion. After embolization, the patient was treated with antithyroid agents and corticosteroid drug therapy. At the same time, severe leukocytosis developed, thyroid hormone values increased, and a CT scan obtained 7 days after embolization showed the thyroid unchanged in volume. We therefore discharged the patient and were waiting for his laboratory blood chemical findings to return to normal. Thirty days later the patient was readmitted to hospital, and a new CT scan showed that the thyroid mass had diminished to half its initial volume. We could therefore perform a total thyroidectomy through a cervical approach alone. The only problem arose in dissecting tight right inferior laryngeal nerve adhesions to the thyroid capsule, probably sequelae of postembolization thyroiditis. Even though preoperative thyroid-artery embolization cannot be considered a routine technique in cervicomediastinal goiter surgery, in a rare patient who presents with a voluminous goiter such as the one we describe here, it is a useful procedure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background {{in recent}} years, an {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} application of selective embolization of <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries</b> (SETA) in the treatment of thyroid diseases is observed. In the present report, we analyse the value, safety and possible indications for preresective SETA in cases of large toxic goitres. Patients and method the study group comprised 10 patients with large toxic goitre (thyroid volume 254 ± 50 mL), including one patient with cervicomediastinal goitre and one patient with anti-thyroid drug intolerance in state of overt thyrotoxicosis. All the patients underwent SETA of the <b>superior</b> and/or inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries,</b> followed by thyroidectomy, performed up to thirty-six hours after SETA (23. 1 ± 11 h). After embolization, selective angiographies of <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries</b> were performed to ensure that the targeted arteries had been completely occluded. Results and conclusion in all the patients, SETA decreased blood flow through the thyroid. Preresective SETA reduced blood loss during and after thyroidectomy and decreased the operating time, but the differences were too small to justify routine applications of preresective SETA as an adjunct to surgical treatment of toxic goitre. On the other hand, SETA is a safe and minimally-invasive technique, which may become an attractive option for quick preparation to surgery in selected patients with toxic goitre, who present anti-thyroid drug intolerance or refuse radioactive iodine treatment. </p...|$|R
5000|$|The {{parathyroid}} artery is {{the blood}} vessel that carries blood {{to each of}} the parathyroid glands. The parathyroid artery is the single individual artery that provides oxygenated blood supply to the parathyroid glands. While studies have concluded that most subjects' parathyoid glands are supplied by the <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries,</b> up to 45% have been determined to have a [...] "distinct anastomosing branch between the inferior and the <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> arteries." [...] Some have been shown to contain two are more parathroid arteries.|$|R
50|$|Reaching {{the lower}} {{border of the}} thyroid gland it divides into two branches, which supply the postero-inferior parts of the gland, and anastomose with the <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery,</b> and with the {{corresponding}} artery of the opposite side.|$|E
50|$|The {{external}} {{branch is}} susceptible to damage during thyroidectomy or cricothyrotomy, as it lies immediately deep to the <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery.</b> The ability to produce pitched sounds is then impaired along with easy voice fatigability, (usually mono-toned voice).|$|E
5000|$|The {{superior}} thyroid vein {{begins in}} the substance and {{on the surface of}} the thyroid gland, by tributaries corresponding with the branches of the <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery,</b> and ends in the upper part of the internal jugular vein.|$|E
40|$|We have {{recently}} hypothesized that structural and secretory {{components of the}} adult human thyroid gland maintain constant reciprocal and geometrical relationships, even if changes occur in the three-dimensional (3 D) architecture {{of any of these}} elements. This means that thyroid morphology could be studied {{from the point of view}} of a 3 D topology. As a consequence, we have investigated anatomical aspects that could support this assumption. In the present study, we show that the presence of a constant relationship can be demonstrated between the vascular arrangement of the gland, including the extension of intraglandular arterial fields, arterial anastomoses and arterial calibers, and the shape as well as volume of the thyroid. Specifically, a statistically significant difference has been found between the network amplitudes of the <b>superior</b> and inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries</b> in relation to either a conic or an ellipsoidal geometry of the thyroid lobe. In addition, a direct relationship has been implicated between the distribution of arterial anastomoses and the behavior of the lobe as a single hemodynamic unit. Finally, a statistically significant correlation has been observed between average arterial caliber of the inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> and <b>thyroid</b> volume. On the basis of these results, we propose a model of architectural assembly between stromal and parenchymal elements of the adult thyroid that might prove useful in designing a bioartificial gland ex situ. Potential clinical applications of this principle in regenerative medicine of other endocrine organs are highlighted...|$|R
5|$|The {{superior}} parathyroid glands {{receive their}} {{blood from the}} inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries.</b> The inferior parathyroid glands receive a variable blood supply, from either the ascending branch of the inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries</b> or the <b>thyroid</b> ima <b>artery.</b> The inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> arises from the subclavian arteries.|$|R
5|$|The <b>thyroid</b> ima <b>artery</b> {{was first}} defined by German anatomist Johann E. Neubauer {{in the year}} 1772. Hence, it was named the <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> of Neubauer. The artery {{originates}} lower than the inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries,</b> so it {{is also known as}} the lowest <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery.</b>|$|R
50|$|The common carotid usually {{gives off}} no branch {{previous}} to its bifurcation, but it occasionally gives origin to the <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> or its laryngeal branch, the ascending pharyngeal artery, the inferior thyroid artery, or, more rarely, the vertebral artery.|$|E
5000|$|From {{its origin}} under the {{anterior}} {{border of the}} sternocleidomastoid the <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> runs upward and forward for a short distance in the carotid triangle, where it is covered by the skin, platysma, and fascia; it then arches downward beneath the omohyoid, sternohyoid, and sternothyroid muscles.|$|E
50|$|The {{inferior}} laryngeal artery {{climbs the}} trachea {{to the back}} part of the larynx under cover of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle. It is accompanied by the recurrent nerve, and supplies the muscles and mucous membrane of this part, anastomosing with the branch from the opposite side, and with the superior laryngeal branch of the <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{superior}} parathyroid glands {{receive their}} {{blood from the}} inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries.</b> The inferior parathyroid glands receive a variable blood supply, from either the ascending branch of the inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries</b> or the <b>thyroid</b> ima <b>artery.</b> The inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> arises from the subclavian arteries.|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} case of an {{incidental}} finding of the right accessory inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery,</b> emerging from the thyrocervical trunk together with a typical inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery,</b> present in a normal position. On the left side, only single inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> was present. Only one inferior thyroid vein was found on each side. The accessory inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> entered the <b>thyroid</b> gland approximately 1 cm above the normal inferior <b>thyroid,</b> above the <b>superior</b> parathyroid gland. Although accessory vessels of thyroid gland are present in about 5 % of cases, the accessory inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery,</b> emerging from subclavian artery and located above the normal inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery,</b> is very rare...|$|R
50|$|The {{relationship}} between the recurrent laryngeal nerve and inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> is highly variable.The recurrent laryngeal nerve passes upward generally behind, but occasionally in front of, the inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery.</b> This makes it vulnerable to injury during surgery that involves ligating the inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery,</b> such as excision of the lower pole of the thyroid gland.|$|R
50|$|The thyroid is {{supplied}} with arterial {{blood from the}} <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery,</b> {{a branch of the}} external carotid artery, and the inferior thyroid artery, a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, and sometimes by an anatomical variant the thyroid ima artery, which has a variable origin. The <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> splits into anterior and posterior branches supplying the thyroid, and the inferior thyroid artery splits into superior and inferior branches. The superior and inferior thyroid arteries join together behind the outer part of the thyroid lobes. The venous blood is drained via superior and middle thyroid veins, which drain to the internal jugular vein, and via the inferior thyroid veins. The inferior thyroid veins originate in a network of veins and drain into the left and right brachiocephalic veins. Both arteries and veins form a plexus between the two layers of the capsule of the thyroid gland.|$|E
5000|$|The {{superior}} laryngeal artery {{accompanies the}} internal laryngeal {{branch of the}} superior laryngeal nerve, beneath the thyrohyoid muscle. This artery branches from the <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> near its bifurcation from the external carotid artery. Together with the internal laryngeal nerve, it pierces the lateral thyrohyoid membrane, and supplies blood to the muscles, mucous membrane, and glands of the larynx, connecting with the branch from the opposite side.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vascular}} {{supply to}} the laryngopharynx includes the <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery,</b> the lingual artery and the ascending pharyngeal artery. The primary neural supply is from both the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves. The vagus nerve provides a branch termed [...] "Arnolds Nerve" [...] which also supplies the external auditory canal, thus laryngopharyngeal cancer can result in referred otalgia. This nerve is also responsible for the ear-cough reflex in which stimulation of the ear canal results in a person coughing.|$|E
40|$|Background: Thyroid gland {{is one of}} {{the vital}} organs in neck region. It is highly vascularized and {{variations}} of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries</b> are frequent and have been well documented in literature. This fact increases the significance of being cautious about thyroid gland while performing surgery in neck region. Objective: To study the morphological anatomy of Inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> and to report the origin of the Inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery,</b> to measure the length of the Inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> from its origin to its entry into the gland, to measure the distance from the midline of the neck to the entry of the Inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> into the <b>thyroid</b> gland and to trace its branches. Method: A total of fifty human cadavers were dissected at anatomy department dissection hall of MGM Medical College, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra and the measurements were taken as per objective of the study. Results: Inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> originated from the thyrocervical trunk in all cases on the left side. On right side in 48 out of 50 cadavers, it originated from thyrocervical trunk (96...|$|R

500|$|The <b>thyroid</b> ima <b>artery</b> (thyroidea ima artery, arteria thyroidea ima, <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> of Neubauer or {{the lowest}} <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery)</b> is an artery {{of the head}} and neck. It is an {{anatomical}} variant that, when present, supplies blood to the thyroid gland primarily, or the trachea, the parathyroid gland and the thymus gland (as thymica accessoria) in rare cases. It has also been reported to be a compensatory artery when {{one or both of the}} inferior <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries</b> are absent and in a few cases the only source of blood to the thyroid gland. It varies in origin, size, blood supply, and termination, and occurs in only 3–10% of the population. Because of the variations and rarity, it [...] may lead to surgical complications.|$|R
50|$|This artery must be ligated at {{the thyroid}} when {{conducting}} a thyroidectomy. If the artery is severed, but not ligated, it will bleed profusely. In {{order to gain}} control of the bleeding, the surgeon may need to extend the original incision laterally to ligate the artery at its origin at the external carotid artery. Furthermore, the external laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve courses in close proximity to the <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery,</b> making it at risk for injury during surgery.|$|E
50|$|Besides distributing {{branches}} to the sternocleidomastoid (which, however, mainly is {{supplied by the}} occipital artery and the <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery),</b> subclavius (which mainly is supplied by the thoracoacromial artery), and neighboring muscles, it gives off a suprasternal branch, which crosses over the sternal end of the clavicle to {{the skin of the}} upper part of the chest; and an acromial branch, which pierces the trapezius and supplies the skin over the acromion, anastomosing with the thoracoacromial artery. Just as with supplying the subclavius muscle, it anastomoses with the thoracoacromial artery in supplying skin areas.|$|E
50|$|The {{underlying}} anatomical distortion causing torticollis is a shortened sternocleidomastoid muscle. This is {{the muscle}} {{of the neck}} that originates at the sternum and clavicle and inserts on the mastoid process {{of the temporal bone}} on the same side. There are two sternocleidomastoid muscles in the human body and when they both contract, the neck is flexed. The main blood supply for these muscles come from the occipital artery, <b>superior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery,</b> transverse scapular artery and transverse cervical artery. The main innervation to these muscles is from cranial nerve XI (the accessory nerve) but the second, third and fourth cervical nerves are also involved. Pathologies in these blood and nerve supplies can lead to torticollis.|$|E
