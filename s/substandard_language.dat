40|$|The present thesis {{focuses on}} the {{translation}} of sociocultural phenomena in movie subtitles. The paper is of a theoretical-empirical nature. Firstly it outlines the basic terms, namely "dialect", "sociolect" and "realia" and describes their function in movie dialogue. Subsequently the attention {{is given to the}} technical and linguistic characteristics of subtitling. The paper then examines the ways of translating the given sociocultural aspects from both descriptive and prescriptive perspectives. In the empirical part, actual examples of the transfer of substandard sociolects and realia, stemming from the movies Entre les murs and Un prophète, are analyzed and commented on. Keywords: movie translation, subtitling, sociocultural phenomena, <b>substandard</b> <b>language,</b> reali...|$|E
40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the task of}} generating English sentences from Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. To cope with this task, we transform each input AMR graph into a structure similar to a dependency tree and annotate it with syntactic information by applying various predefined actions to it. Subsequently, a sentence is obtained from this tree structure by visiting its nodes in a specific order. We train maximum entropy models to estimate the probability of each individual action and devise an algorithm that efficiently approximates the best sequence of actions to be applied. Using a <b>substandard</b> <b>language</b> model, our generator achieves a Bleu score of 27. 4 on the LDC 2014 T 12 test set, the best result reported so far without using silver standard annotations from another corpus as additional training data...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{question}} of how vulgarisms are translated {{in the context of a}} literary text. First we sum up the theories of expressivity used in both common and literary communication. We point out the main typological differences between Czech and French as well as the key cultural differences in the perception of expressivity. We define the term 'vulgarism' and try to outline the use of <b>substandard</b> <b>language</b> in both Czech and French literature. In the following chapter Michel Houellebecq, his work and the fundamental traits of his writing style are presented. We also look at the reception of the Czech translation of Houellebecq's novel Les Particules élémentaires. Then we analyse the translation, focusing on the transfer of vulgarisms in order to trace and evaluate the translation method used to convey the vulgar elements of the original work...|$|E

40|$|Research at Ghent University (UGent) {{has shown}} that non native {{speakers}} of Dutch (the main language of instruction at UGent) {{are less likely to}} achieve academic success than their L 1 peers. Since advanced linguistic skills are key to all aspects of college life, <b>substandard</b> academic <b>language</b> skills can exclude students both socially and academically even though they may have the required talent and intellectual capacity. To help resolve this issue Ghent University launched a language policy unit in 2009. One of the purposes of this project is to eliminate language as a barrier to study success, for both L 1 and L 2 speakers of Dutch. This paper will focus on one area of expertise of the language policy unit, i. e. the language support workshops for students with an L 2 background (L 2 workshops). These workshops have been implemented specifically for non-native speakers and are explicitly task-based. This paper will elaborate on the paths that have been tried and rejected (such as a placement test-based system and a social-constructivist inclusive approach) as well as on those that have been pursued. Additionally, this paper will zoom in on the role of students of the Ghent University teacher training program in the L 2 workshops. Participating in the workshops requires a future teacher to adopt a different mindset, since both the pedagogical approach and the students are different to what the interns are used to. In order to establish the effect of a non-conventional internship on the teaching beliefs of future teachers, the language policy unit conducted a number of focus groups in April-July 2011. In this paper we will show how and why academic L 2 project is conducive to both the linguistic skills of the participants and the teaching beliefs and pedagogic practices of the interns...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} is relevant {{due to the}} intensification of dynamics of the formation, functioning and penetration of social and professional jargon into conversational, journalistic and fiction styles in the Ukrainian language in the late XX - early XXI century. The aim of the {{research is}} to provide linguistic analysis of predominantly new (less frequently - known earlier) jargons of modern Ukrainian language formed by semantic way. The article has the following objectives: to clarify the concept of “jargon”, to enter new lexical items from different jargons formed by lexical and semantic way and mostly unrecorded in Ukrainian dictionaries into scientific usage; to conduct proper linguistic analysis of some features of semantic derivation, emerging and active in modern Ukrainian <b>language.</b> <b>Substandard</b> formations, recorded in the online discourse in the language of journalism, fiction, and in the colloquial speech of certain social and professional groups served as the material for the study. This article provides a detailed analysis of some features of semantic derivation of different jargons. The author made the following conclusions: semantic derivation processes in discourse of Ukrainian jargons, especially among youth, sports, computer, automotive, military and police are very active; especially productive are processes of semantic expansion of sub-units mainly based on different kinds of metaphors somewhat less - metonymy; Ukrainian modern jargon has predominantly anthropocentric nature because the main object of interest is concentrated on the person, including their appearance, psychological and intellectual features, demeanor, communication and so on...|$|R
40|$|Soviet {{literature}} of the twenties and thirties is examined {{in the present study}} in its relationship to other verbal genres, primarily, the speeches of Party leaders, newspaper rhetoric and political posters. The first four chapters of the dissertation focus on such topics as the reception of Marxist-Leninist discourse by peasants and workers as well as its representation in fiction; the refraction of official discursive formulas in characters' speech and the dialogization of Party rhetoric; the integration of political documents into fiction and their structural function. Particular attention is paid to the way the contamination of Party rhetoric by <b>substandard</b> <b>language</b> and its contextual defamiliarization lead, depending on the overall authorial intention, either to a parodic subversion of official cliches or to the internalization of didactic discourse and the enhancement of its communicative effectiveness. The theme of industrialization is examined in the last two chapters of the thesis in its dialectic interaction with various Neo-Rousseauist conceptions, which either reflect the authors' own ambivalence about socialist construction, or constitute a rhetorical device used in order to reinforce dialogically industrialist ideology...|$|E

The trends which the thesis confirms are: Back-clipping is the most frequent type of clipping, the other types are rare. Clippings are mostly created from nouns. Plain clippings are mostly mono- or disyllabic and they mostly respect the syllable divisions in the base. This means that plain clippings are mostly created from the first syllable of the base. Clippings are mostly colloquial/informal. What the thesis adds is the precise expression of the proportions of the individual features and also the identification of the different motivation behind the creation of embellished clippings. In other words, the analysis shows that embellished clippings differ from plain clippings not only on formal grounds, i. e. the presence of the suffix, but also in other features: embellished clippings have more often an adjectival base, they are more often stylistically marked, more often slang, more often regionally specific and less often specific for a subject field. This shows that embellished clippings are trendy, created to attract attention, part of the <b>substandard</b> <b>language</b> and that the ingroup status is even intensified in embellished clippings.

40|$|An {{important}} {{milestone in}} the development of Russian became the 80 s of the 20 th century. Significant social changes caused by «perestroika» in political, economic and social fields obviously had to be reflected in the language. The beginning of these changes is characterized by the exchange of entire parts of lexis. Lexical units from an active lexis were transferred to its periphery and vice versa - words from a passive lexis having been already comprehended as historicisms retumed to its centre. ln the next period, Russian must cope with the inflow of non-standard lexis, which «floods» written work and oral speeches as well. The standard language is under a big pressure of <b>substandard</b> <b>language</b> fields, such as colloquial language, jargon, argot. A new part of lexis was being talked about - common jargon or interjargon. Since the changes started, Russian has had to cope with a big inflow of foreign words, borrowed particularly from English and its American variant, which serves especially for the designation of new objects, phenomena and processes, but also as the substitution of already existing multiword domestic expressions. Lots of borrowings also become synonyms to already existing oneword Russian equivalents. Borrowing Anglicisms is of bigger dynamics aH the time, and in present Russian, Anglicisms [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Dialect is a <b>substandard</b> form of <b>language</b> that {{generally}} associated with particular group of speaker in more isolated {{part of the}} world. Tengger people live in the isolated highland region in and around Bromo-Tengger-Semeru National Park in East Java. Tengger people are Javanese sub-community who have special characteristics of culture and language. In fact, the culture and language are different from Javanese. The specification of differences {{can be seen from}} their dialects, that their dialect is known as Java dialect Tengger. Focus of this research is to know dialect variation used by Tengger people in Javanese regional language especially in the form of vocabularies and sound patterns used. This research used descriptive qualitative method, because this research revealed the existence of dialect variations between the Javanese and Tengger people. The variations were in the vocabularies and sound patters that contained of differences. Data obtained from the informants who live in Tengger highland. The informants used in this research were selected by using the criteria of NORMs (Non-on Mobile Older Rural and Males) to obtain actual data. The data were collected by using observation and interview techniques. They were appropriate to the purpose and statement of the problem. The data of this research were analyzed qualitatively. The result of this research is there were some differences in the form of vocabularies and sound patterns used by Tengger people in Javanese regional language. And also, there were some variations of Tengger dialect in Javanese regional language in the phoneme, morpheme, and lexicon especially in the vocabularies and sound patterns used. The variations also happen in the form of affixations. The accent of Tengger dialect has unique characteristics in stressing of vowel, whether a vowel in the end of syllable pronounced long, also Tengger dialect has flat intonation in sentences used. It is concluded that factors that influence the diversity of languages and dialects Tengger regional Javanese language were external and internal. An external factor was beyond the language system, including: history, socio-cultural place and situation. While, internal factor existed in the language itself, for example phonetic variation, phonological variation, and morphological variation...|$|R

40|$|Whose text {{is a work}} {{of fiction}} in translation? The aim of this thesis is to examine what happens to a novel when it is {{translated}} from one language into another. By analysing the Swedish translations of six contemporary novels written in English I attempt to identify what I refer to as the translator´s voice. The translations have been made by two of Sweden´s most highly thought-of translators, Else Lundgren and Caj Lundgren. The theoretical framework of my study is derived from Translation Studies, basically an empirical and interdisciplinary discipline, which is introduced in Chapter Two; Chapter One provides a general survey of previous research and thought on translation. My starting-point is a model for describing translations compiled within the descriptive branch of Translation Studies. Chapter Three is devoted to the translator Else Lundgren. After a short biographical presentation I summarise her views on, and experiences of translating. I then provide a brief survey of her translations, discussing how they have been received by the reviewers, and finally turn to a close reading of two of her translations: Julys folk, a translation of Nadine Gordimer´s July´s People, where Else Lundgren´s strategy of clarification is in evidence; and Heja Coventry, her version of Sue Townsend´s Rebuilding Coventry, where her mode of renedering <b>substandard</b> <b>language</b> is of particular interest. Chapter Four contains a general presentation of Caj Lundgren and an analysis of four of his translations. In addition to being a prolific translator, he works as a reviewer for the national daily Svenska Dagbladet, where he also publishes poems on topical subjects, an activity which has left imprint on his translations. In Jordiska makter, his translation of Anthony Burgess´Earthly Powers, I am particularly concerned with Caj Lundgren´s renditions of of the original´s rich vocabulary and phraseology. In De besatta, his translation of A. S. Byatt´s novel Possession, as well as his translations of Saul Bellow´s The Bellarosa Connection and Richard Ford´s Wildlife, my focus of interest is on characterization. In bellow´s novel, for example, the plot is told by a first-person narrator who recapitulates events that occurred during an earlier period of his life. Subtle linguistic changes cause the narrator to appear different in the translation from what he is in the translation. In the final chapter, which provides a survey of how translations are commented on in different kinds of reviews, the question is posed: whose text is scrutinised in a review of a work of fiction in translation...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} language, {{and to a lesser extent}} the style, of Thackeray, chiefly as these appear in the novels and tales. The aim and method are similar to those of G. L. Brook in The Language of Dickens. Brook states in the Preface to his book that the {{two-fold}} aim is to help in the understanding of both the history of the English language and the novels of Dickens'. Much the same is attempted in this study of Thackeray. Consistent with this aim, my method, again following that of Brook, is the examination of words, phrases etc., in so far as they differ from present usage, or in so far as they are especially characteristic of the author I have studied. Clearly, in the first chapter on Style, the emphasis is on the particular characteristics of the language of the novelist; whereas the second chapter, on Regency English in the Victorian period, has more to say about changes that occurred in the language during Thackeray's lifetime (l 8 l 1 - 63). A third chapter on Slang discusses <b>substandard</b> <b>language</b> used by characters in the novel. There is little attempt at etymology (the etymology of slang is often exceedingly problematical); I am more concerned with the role of slang in the narrative. This third chapter is concerned with particular words, whereas the fourth, on Register, deals with levels of conversation generally, as well as with the novelist's diverse methods of representing speech. There is a section on Grammar, Word-formation and Lexis; largely from the point of view of the historian of language, though the novelist's special contributions to the vocabulary of English are also listed. A sixth section, again following the example of Brook, is concerned with Regional Dialects, and the way in which the novelist represents these, whether faithfully or, at times, facetiously. The seventh chapter is especially concerned with the English of Henry Esmond, considering the characteristics of the pastiche language of that novel, and how far there are elements of anachronistic Victorian English in what purports to be a narrative of the reign of George II. Here both of Brook's aims are illustrated: salient differences between eighteenth and nineteenth century English appear, but Thackeray's particular skills as an archaizer can also be demonstrated. An eight chapter on Proper Names is included to sample and savour the novelist's unequalled gift in wittily appropriate nomenclature; and a concluding one on Modes of Address is modelled on an article on such addressives in the novels of Trollope by George Watson (see Bibliography). It is concerned to illustrate the more formal, and accordingly more varied modes of address in Victorian times...|$|E
40|$|Semantic {{transfer}} and word formation both use the already existing lexical units as naming sources {{in order to}} react adequately to the diverse naming demands of the language user. The research aims {{to answer the question}} about the distribution of onomasiological targets between semantic {{transfer and}} word formation produced from the most frequent German body part terms. The interaction of semantic transfer and word formation manifests in different lexical categories that become the result of naming processes. Moreover, word formation, due to the dominating status of composition in German, reveals a higher diversity of naming targets than semantic transfer does. Both naming ways can also interact while producing the same word, when word formation is accompanied by semantic transfer. The interaction of these naming ways in the sphere of targets is of a complimentary nature. Zarówno transfer semantyczny jak i metody słowotwórcze wykorzystują już istniejące elementy leksykalne jako źródła nazewnictwa, umożliwiając tym samym odpowiednią reakcję na różne potrzeby użytkownika języka pojawiające się w tym zakresie. Niniejsze badanie ma na celu odpowiedź na pytanie o podział celów onomazjologicznych pomiędzy transfer semantyczny a metody słowotwórcze na bazie najczęściej używanych nazw części ciała w języku niemieckim. Interakcja pomiędzy transferem semantycznym a metodami słowotwórczymi znajduje swój wyraz w rozmaitych kategoriach, będących rezultatem procesów nazewnictwa. Co więcej, metody słowotwórcze, z racji ich dominującego statusu w kompozycji niemieckiej, wykazują się większą różnorodnością wytworów nazewniczych niż transfer semantyczny. Oba sposoby nazewnictwa mogą też pozostać ze sobą w interakcji, prowadząc do powstania tego samego słowa wówczas, gdy metodom słowotwórczym towarzyszy transfer semantyczny. Interakcja wspomnianych sposobów tworzenia nazw w sferze wytworów nazewniczych jest komplementarna. julia 0887 @tut. byMinsk State Linguistic UniversityAbayev, Vasilij I. 1949.
