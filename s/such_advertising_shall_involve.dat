Controversy over DTCA has grown since the Food and Drug Administration liberalized its regulations in 1997. Proponents claim that <b>such</b> <b>advertising</b> educates consumers, promotes patient participation in clinical decisions, and improves patient adherence to medication instructions. Opponents argue that <b>such</b> <b>advertising</b> is meant to persuade, not educate, and that it promotes inappropriate use of prescription drugs, or diverts consumers from better alternatives.

40|$|Background Evidence {{suggests}} that direct-to-consumer advertising {{of prescription drugs}} increases pharmaceutical sales and both helps to avert underuse of medicines and leads to potential overuse. Concern about <b>such</b> <b>advertising</b> has increased recently owing to the {{withdrawal from the market}} of heavily advertised drugs found to carry serious risks. Moreover, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been criticized for its weak enforcement of laws regulating <b>such</b> <b>advertising.</b> Methods We examined industry-wide trends in spending by pharmaceutical companies on direct-to-consumer advertising and promotion to physicians during the past decade. We characterized the drugs for which <b>such</b> <b>advertising</b> is used and assessed the timing of advertising after a drug is introduced. Finally, we examined trends in the FDA's regulation of drug advertising. Results Total spending on pharmaceutical promotion grew from $ 11. 4 billion in 1996 to $ 29. 9 billion in 2005. Although during that time spending on direct-to-consumer advertising increased by 330 %, it made up only 14 % of total promotional expenditures in 2005. Directto- consumer campaigns generally begin within a year after the approval of a product by the FDA. In the context of regulatory changes requiring legal review before issuing letters, the number of letters sent by the FDA to pharmaceutical manufacturers regarding violations of drug-advertising regulations fell from 142 in 1997 to only 21 in 2006. Conclusions Spending on direct-to-consumer advertising has continued to increase in recent years in spite of the criticisms leveled against it. Our findings suggest that calls for a moratorium on <b>such</b> <b>advertising</b> for new drugs would represent a dramatic departure from current practices...|$|R

This was followed by a detailed study of consumer perception of <b>such</b> <b>advertising,</b> using the confirmatory method. This research found that the advertisement's attractiveness, followed by its trustworthiness and the message value congruency can influence consumers' perception on the advertiser's corporate image. Besides this, consumers were found to place less importance on the advertiser's expertise. Moreover, the advertiser and consumer's involvement in the issues they championed only passively influenced consumers' perceptions. We urge future researchers to explore and expand the scales discussed, as well as consider whether they will create a similar impact on commercial and non-commercial messages. Futhermore, how will the level of consumer assurance towards a certain product advertised, influence consumers' perception towards the advertiser's image...|$|R
