Later when Confederate forces abandoned Norfolk on 11 May 1862, they were forced to destroy Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Bonnie {{remained}} virtually stationary {{until the}} morning of September23 when it drifted very <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> the west-southwest {{in response to the}} ridge. It also began to gradually weaken as the low-level center became exposed and the storm became poorly organized. Convection also diminished, and on the afternoon of September24, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical storm as it drifted over cooler waters. Bonnie continued to lose most of its deep convection during the day on September25 as it began to make a turn back around to the south. That evening, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{proceeded}} <b>slowly,</b> <b>to</b> {{the extent}} that there were letters in the local newspaper complaining about the delays. The first train ran into Epworth on 25 November 1901, to test the new bridge, and the event was attended by a crowd of over 400. The line involved more earthworks than the Goole and Marshland Light Railway, with major cuttings at Haxey and Epworth, where steam excavators were used, and a swing bridge over the canal at Crowle. The first fatality was a 15-year-old boy who {{was hit by a}} rock during blasting, and died at Doncaster Hospital in early 1902.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{began to}} slowly weaken and lose tropical characteristics on early September 12 {{as it moved}} over colder waters and encountered increasing wind shear. However, the storm was moving quickly enough to make landfall over Cape Breton, Nova Scotia as a Category1 hurricane on September 12. Later that morning, Gustav made a second landfall in Newfoundland and became extratropical shortly after. The extratropical low continued moving <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> the northeast before dissipating over the Labrador Sea on September 15.|$|E

5|$|The storm peaked {{early on}} July24 with winds of 160mph (260km/h) and a {{barometric}} pressure estimated at 920mbar (hPa; 27.17inHg). The following day, unknown factors caused the storm to suddenly weaken before increasing wind shear took over. The storm gradually weakened {{for the duration}} of its existence, turning <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> the northwest. Late on July28, the storm brushed Johnston Atoll, bringing gusty winds and light rainfall to the region. Gilma persisted until July31 at which time it was downgraded to a tropical depression and dissipated over open waters.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the bailout}} support {{programme}} feature sufficient financial transfers until March 2016, Cyprus began <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> regain its {{access to the}} private lending markets already in June 2014. At this point of time, the government sold €0.75bn of bonds with a five-year maturity, {{to the tune of}} a 4.85% yield. A continued selling of bonds with a ten-year maturity, which would equal a regain of complete access to the private lending market (and mark the end of the era with need for bailout support), is expected to happen sometime in 2015. The Cypriot minister of finance recently confirmed, that the government plan to issue two new European Medium Term Note (EMTN) bonds in 2015, likely shortly ahead of the expiry of another €1.1bn bond on 1 July and a second expiry of a €0.9bn bond on 1 November. As announced in advance, the Cypriot government issued €1bn of seven-year bonds with a 4.0% yield by the end of April 2015.|$|E

5|$|As Erica moved {{towards the}} south and {{subsequently}} to the north, the cyclone strengthened, becoming equivalent to a tropical storm according to the JTWC by 1500UTC on 5 March. Erica later attained maximum sustained winds of 105km/h (65mph 1-minute sustained). However the system began to move against {{the direction of the}} wind shear environment, and it lost much of its organization. On 7 March at 2230UTC, Erica lost cyclone status and degenerated into a tropical low. The remnant circulation moved <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> the northeast, and the wind shear conditions abated. As a result, Erica began to gain some signs of organization. At this time the remnants moved towards the southeast {{as a result of an}} upper-level trough developing over Australia.|$|E
5|$|At around 13:00, {{tanks of}} the Panzer-Lehr Division {{advanced}} into Villers-Bocage unsupported by infantry. Four Panzer IVs tried to enter {{from the south}} near a wrecked Panzer IV and two were knocked out by anti-tank fire. Some Tigers were brought up and, in an exchange of fire, silenced the anti-tank position. Möbius divided the primary counter-attack down the main highway through Villers-Bocage and through the southern section of town parallel to the main road, to secure the town centre. The Tigers advanced <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> intimidate the British into withdrawing {{and ran into the}} British ambush. The Firefly opened fire on the lead tank and missed but the anti-tank gun knocked it out. A group of three Tigers split up and drove through the back streets to flank the British; one was engaged by an anti-tank gun and destroyed, the other two were engaged with PIATs, one was knocked out and the other immobilised.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Graham of the 2002–03 Australian region cyclone {{season was}} a weak {{tropical}} storm that affected Australia during late February and early March 2003. Graham originated {{from an area}} of convection that emerged onto water after sitting over Australia on 23 February. The interaction with a monsoon trough formed an {{area of low pressure}} that developed into Tropical Cyclone Graham on 27 February. The storm moved <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> the east-southeast, and after turning to the south it peaked as a tropical storm and made landfall on Western Australia the next day. The cyclone weakened as it moved inland, and dissipated on 1 March. The storm dropped heavy rainfall and caused high winds, which produced flooding and downed trees. One fatality occurred, though no significant damages were reported.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Mitch's {{meteorological}} history {{began with}} its origins over Africa as a tropical wave and lasted until its dissipation as an extratropical cyclone {{north of the}} United Kingdom. Tropical Depression Thirteen formed on October22, 1998, over the southwestern Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave that exited Africa on October10. It executed a small loop, and while doing so intensified into Tropical Storm Mitch. A weakness in a ridge allowed the storm to track <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> the north. After becoming disorganized due to wind shear from a nearby upper-level low, Mitch quickly intensified in response to improving conditions which included warm waters and good outflow. It became a hurricane on October24 and developed an eye. After turning to the west, Mitch rapidly intensified, first into a major hurricane on October25 and then into a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale the next day.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Nate was an Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{that threatened}} Bermuda but remained at sea during early September 2005. The fourteenth named storm and seventh hurricane {{of the annual}} Atlantic hurricane season, Nate formed southwest of Bermuda on September 5 and initially moved very <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> the northeast. Early forecasts suggested a possible threat to the island, but Nate passed well to its south as a Category1 hurricane on September 8. After {{moving away from the}} island, the storm entered a region with cooler sea surface temperatures and unfavorable wind shear, causing it to weaken to a tropical storm before becoming extratropical on September 10. The extratropical remnant was later absorbed by a larger weather system.|$|E

5|$|Iodous {{acid and}} iodite are even less stable and exist {{only as a}} {{fleeting}} intermediate in the oxidation of iodide to iodate, if at all. Iodates {{are by far the}} most important of these compounds, which can be made by oxidising alkali metal iodides with oxygen at 600°C and high pressure, or by oxidising iodine with chlorates. Unlike chlorates, which disproportionate very <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> form chloride and perchlorate, iodates are stable to disproportionation in both acidic and alkaline solutions. From these, salts of most metals can be obtained. Iodic acid is most easily made by oxidation of an aqueous iodine suspension by electrolysis or fuming nitric acid. Iodate has the weakest oxidising power of the halates, but reacts the quickest.|$|E
5|$|ML254 {{then began}} <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> leave the harbour mouth, {{carrying}} 38survivors of Vindictives 55crewmen huddled on deck, where they remained exposed to machine gun {{fire from the}} shore. As Drummond turned his boat seawards and proceeded back to the offshore squadron that was still engaged in an artillery duel with the German defenders, one of the missing launches, ML276 passed her, having {{caught up with the}} lost cruiser at this late stage. Drummond called to ML276s commander—Lieutenant Rowley Bourke—that he believed there were still men in the water and Bourke immediately entered the harbour to search for them. Drummond's launch proceeded to the rendezvous with the destroyer , overweighted and sinking, so severe was the damage she had suffered.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{enemies are}} already {{adapted to the}} habitat and to the target pest, and their {{conservation}} can be simple and cost-effective, as when nectar-producing crop plants are grown in the borders of rice fields. These provide nectar to support parasitoids and predators of planthopper pests and have been demonstrated to be so effective (reducing pest densities by 10- or even 100-fold) that farmers sprayed 70% less insecticides and enjoyed yields boosted by 5%. Predators of aphids were similarly found {{to be present in}} tussock grasses by field boundary hedges in England, but they spread too <b>slowly</b> <b>to</b> reach the centres of fields. Control was improved by planting a metre-wide strip of tussock grasses in field centres, enabling aphid predators to overwinter there.|$|E
