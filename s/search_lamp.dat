40|$|This {{position}} paper is a philosophical {{discourse on the}} place of autonomy of learning in education. The topic is informed by a reflection on the various problems that beset education, ranging from examination malpractice, poor performance in public examinations and false admission into higher institutions of learning, among other things. The writer tries to consider the place of autonomy in learners ’ activities. It {{is not uncommon to}} narrow down the consideration of autonomy to issues related to administration and funding of education, but this paper tries to critically see beyond these to postulate autonomy as a crucial foundation of learning itself. It adopts the existentialist philosophy as a <b>search</b> <b>lamp</b> to reach a conclusion that autonomy is natural to every learner and it carries in him the properties for learning as manifest in attributes of freedom, potency for choice-making and responsibility. Recommendations are made to teachers and other stakeholders in education to foster those things that could drive home a sense of autonomy in the learners and enhance personal commitment to learning...|$|E

He opened his lips as if to argue further, but shut them again without saying anything. I had a vision so vivid of poor Burns in his exhaustion, helplessness, and anguish, that it moved me more than the reality I had come away from only an hour before. It was purged from the drawbacks of his personality, and I could not resist it.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{performance}} variations associated with lamp geometry and distribution in portable table luminaires. If correctly retrofit with {{compact fluorescent lamps}} (CFLs), these high use fixtures produce significant energy savings, but if misused, these products could instead generate consumer dissatisfaction with CFLs. It is our assertion that the lumen distribution of the light source within the luminaires plays {{a critical role in}} total light output, fixture efficiency and efficacy, and, perhaps most importantly, perceived brightness. We studied nearly 30 different integral (screw-based) CFLs available on the market today in <b>search</b> of a <b>lamp,</b> or group of lamps, which work best in portable table luminaires. Our findings conclusively indicate that horizontally oriented CFLs outperform all other types of CFLs in nearly every aspect...|$|R
40|$|Relying on {{headlamp}} illumination {{for visual}} detection of cryptic nocturnal animals may present a challenge. To test how search light properties affect brown treesnake (Boiga irregularis) detection rate, we assigned eight biologists {{to search for}} dead snakes placed in roadside vegetation. Each person conducted 4 <b>searches</b> using <b>lamps</b> with varying properties: weak versus strong light, crossed by narrow versus wide beam. On each occasion, 100 snakes were placed randomly along the roadside transect. The mean number spotted per transect search was 13. 5. Using an information theoretic approach, sequential order of transect runs was the only confounding variable included in the model with the highest support: 1. 5 fewer snakes (95 % CI = - 0. 4 to - 2. 5) were found for every sequential transect search a person conducted. A narrow beam spotlight rendered almost seven fewer snakes per search than a broad beam floodlight (95 % CI = - 4. 5 to - 9. 2). A weak light rendered 4. 5 fewer snakes than a strong light (95 % CI = - 2. 1 to - 6. 9). We suspect that the benefit of using a lamp with a floodlight beam is particularly pronounced when a complex, 3 -dimensional forested habitat is surveyed and when the traveling speed is relatively high...|$|R

Without information or attention to fauna and activity seasonal in a zone, adopting alike prophylactic or control methods to various species of scorpions, in more cases are unsuccessful. According to the kind of habitat of digging and non-digging scorpions, for scorpions collecting, probable refuges were searched by two methods daily <b>searching</b> and UV <b>lamp</b> at night in various zones of Abomosa, Great & Small Tonbs and Hengam Islands. The Scorpions were transferred to the laboratory and were identified and appointed their sex ratio. In this study, 311 and 134 scorpions were collected from Abumosa and Great Tonb, respectively and all of them were classified as Buthotus jayakari. In our study we could’nt find any scorpion. In Hengam island 155 scorpions were collected, that 134 and 21 scorpions respectively were belong to B. jayakari and Mesobuthus eupeus species. In conclusion B. jayakari and M. eupeus are scorpion fauna in the Persian Gulf Islands...|$|R
40|$|Two {{important}} {{subjects in}} high frequency fluorescent lighting are investigated. Part I. presents a fundamental {{understanding of the}} negative incremental impedance of flourescent <b>lamps.</b> <b>Search</b> for simple, high power factor, lamp ballast topologies, a more practical aspect of lighting electronics, is presented in Part II. Part I. Flourescent lamps have a special v-i characteristic. Their incremental or small-signal impedance is defined and studied in the frequency domain. It is found that the negative incremental impedance of a fluorescent lamp can be characterized by a right half plane zero. The existence of such a result is explained by the modified Francis equation. Two approaches are proposed in order {{to set up a}} stable operating point for the lamp. First, a resonant matching network, which provides impedance transformation, is placed between a voltage source and the lamp. Second, a feedback loop is closed from the lamp current to control the magnitude of the voltage source. Stability criteria based on the Nyquist criterion are developed for the impedance of the resonant matching network and for the loop gain in the above two cases, respectively. It is found that the input impedance of a switching dc-to-dc regulator, which is another case with the negative incremental impedance, and the fluorescent lamp impedance, are two dual cases and thus can be analyzed in a unified manner based on the stability of one-port circuit. The small-signal lamp impedance is measured in the most practical case of a sinusoidal carrier, and it is fit by a real rational function with a right half plane zero. The small signal models describing low frequency variations of sinusoidal magnitude are developed and are experimentally verified for the three major resonant matching networks. Stability analysis for resonant matching networks at parallel resonance are performed. It shows that the LCC network is the simplest resonant matching network that a fluorescent lamp needs. It is also predicted, and experimentally verified, that the resonant matching networks at series resonance are feasible as ballasts when the lamp current feedback loop is closed. Part II. Unlike conventional high power factor ballasts requiring two cascaded power conversion stages, the proposed new lamp ballasts achieve near unity input power factor and high frequency sinusoidal lamp current in a single power conversion stage. A single-stage, high power factor lamp ballast is proposed, which is derived from the Cuk converter. A new discontinuous inductor current mode of its input inductor makes this possible by separating the input current-shaping from the output high frequency inversion. The desirable mode of operation is presented with major waveforms. The high efficiency is further enhanced by the soft-switching improvement, which is provided naturally through the lagging current of the resonant matching network. Design equations are given. The performances of the proposed single-stage, high power factor lamp ballast are verified by the experimental results. Single-switch, unity power factor ac-to-ac converter topologies based on proper integrations of automatic current shapers and single-switch inverters, such as the Class E converter, are presented, which are suitable for lamp ballast applications. Descriptions of the desirable mode of operations and a first order analysis are given. The ballasts have the compact structure of single active switch, high input power factor and low crest factor lamp current as well as soft-switching. Experimental results confirm all the performance advantages...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have come}} to the {{conclusion}} that for the proper carrying out of what we will call our Great Experiment we must have absolute and complete isolation. Isolation not merely for a day or two, but for as long as we may require. Here such a thing would be impossible; the needs and habits of a great city with its ingrained possibilities of interruption, would, or might, quite upset us. Telegrams, registered letters, or express messengers would alone be sufficient; but the great army of those who want to get something would make disaster certain. In addition, the occurrences of the last week have drawn police attention to this house. Even if special instructions to keep an eye on it have not been issued from Scotland Yard or the District Station, you may be sure that the individual policeman on his rounds will keep it well under observation. Besides, the servants who have discharged themselves will before long begin to talk. They must; for they have, for the sake of their own characters, to give some reason for the termination of a service which has I should say a position in the neighbourhood. The servants of the neighbours will begin to talk, and, perhaps the neighbours themselves. Then the active and intelligent Press will, with its usual zeal for the enlightenment of the public and its eye to increase of circulation, get hold of the matter. When the reporter is after us we shall not have much chance of privacy. Even if we were to bar ourselves in, we should not be free from interruption, possibly from intrusion. Either would ruin our plans, and so we must take measures to effect a retreat, carrying all our impedimenta with us. For this I am prepared. For a long time past I have foreseen such a possibility, and have made preparation for it. Of course, I had no foreknowledge of what has happened; but I knew something would, or might, happen. For more than two years past my house in Cornwall has been made ready to receive all the curios which are preserved here. When Corbeck went off on his <b>search</b> for the <b>lamps</b> I had the old house at Kyllion made ready; it is fitted with electric light all over, and all the appliances for manufacture of the light are complete. I had perhaps better tell you, for none of you, not even Margaret, knows anything of it, that the house is absolutely shut out from public access or even from view. It stands on a little rocky promontory behind a steep hill, and except from the sea cannot be seen. Of old it was fenced in by a high stone wall, for the house which it succeeded was built by an ancestor of mine in the days when a great house far away from a centre had to be prepared to defend itself. Here, then, is a place so well adapted to our needs that it might have been prepared on purpose. I shall explain it to you when we are all there. This will not be long, for already our movement is in train. I have sent word to Marvin to have all preparation for our transport ready. He is to have a special train, which is to run at night so as to avoid notice. Also a number of carts and stone-wagons, with sufficient men and appliances to take all our packing-cases to Paddington. We shall be away before the Argus-eyed Pressman is on the watch. We shall today begin our packing up; and I dare say that by tomorrow night we shall be ready. In the outhouses I have all the packing-cases which were used for bringing the things from Egypt, and I am satisfied that as they were sufficient for the journey across the desert and down the Nile to Alexandria and thence on to London, they will serve without fail between here and Kyllion. We four men, with Margaret to hand us such things as we may require, will be able to get the things packed safely; and the carrier's men will take them to the trucks.|$|R
