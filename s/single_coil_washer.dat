5000|$|The {{first one}} is an exact replica of his n°1 guitar which {{features}} a poplar body with maple neck, rosewood fingerboard, 4 pickups (a DiMarzio Steve Morse bridge and neck model humbuckers, and two DiMarzio <b>single</b> <b>coils,</b> a DP 117 and a custom wound Steve Morse <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> in HSSH configuration) volume and tone controls. The switching is also particular: it features a three-way selector that changes between the bridge humbucker, the neck humbucker and the first <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> (aligned with the bridge humbucker), a mini switch that adds the bridge pickup to any configuration and a third switch that adds the second, slant <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> to any configuration. This switch also allows for independent <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> selection.|$|R

5000|$|A typical fat strat, this guitar {{features}} H-S-S (humbucker/ <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> / <b>single</b> <b>coil)</b> pick-up configuration {{and had a}} 22-fret fretboard, and a non-licensed [...] "Fender Synchronized tremolo"'s bridge. Body with a Fender-style plastic pickguard.|$|R
5000|$|UltraLux Series XL-5 and Ultralux Series XL-2. The XL-5 {{comes with}} two humbuckers and one <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> pickup, the XL-2 is {{identical}} except {{it lacks the}} <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> pickup. Equipped with the FCS-2 bridge system.|$|R
2500|$|The P-90 (sometimes written P90) is a <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> {{electric}} guitar pickup produced by Gibson since 1946. Gibson is still producing P-90s, {{and there are}} outside companies that manufacture replacement versions. [...] Compared to other <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> designs, such as the ubiquitous Fender <b>single</b> <b>coil,</b> the bobbin for a P-90 is wider but shorter. [...] The Fender style <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> is wound in a taller bobbin but the wires are closer to the individual poles. [...] This makes the P-90 produce {{a different type of}} tone, somewhat warmer with less edge and brightness. [...] The P-90 is still subject to 60 cycle hum unless some form of hum cancelling is used.|$|R
50|$|The Traditional uses a stacked <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> for {{the bridge}} pickup {{and a regular}} <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> for the neck pickup (unlike the dual <b>single</b> <b>coils</b> on most Fender Telecasters) on a two piece carved swamp ash body, again, with a {{recessed}} bolt on maple neck. It is available in either Natural Swamp Ash, or Satin Blue finishes. The Traditional, as the name suggests, is designed for people looking for a more traditional T-Shape guitar.|$|R
5000|$|VCC {{is similar}} to coil splitting, in that it changes the tone of a humbucking pick-up {{to that of a}} <b>single</b> <b>coil,</b> but it does it by turning the tone knob ... without the hum {{normally}} associated with <b>single</b> <b>coils.</b>|$|R

50|$|The EDR170 model {{consisted}} of an Ibanez Wizard II maple neck with medium sized frets, a rosewood fretboard and an Ibanez Ergodyne headstock; a superstrat-type body made of Luthite; plastic strap buttons; two Ibanez Powersound humbuckers and a Powersound <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> pickup in humbucker-single-humbucker configuration; a volume knob and a tone knob; and an Ibanez synchronised tremolo bridge. This guitar was the simplest model {{available in the}} Ergodyne series and came in two colours: Iron Pewter and Moonshadow. The model had a five-way pickup selector blade switch which selected the pickups in five combinations:1. The neck humbucker.2.The neck humbucker and <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> mid pickup.3. The <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> mid pickup.4. The <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> mid pickup and the bridge humbucker.5. The bridge humbucker.|$|R
50|$|Coil tapping is {{tapping into}} the inner <b>coil</b> of a <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> pickup to get a lower output or vintage tone (see coil tapping). It is often {{confused}} with coil splitting, which is switching {{off one of the}} coils of a humbucker, giving the pickup a <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> tone.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> pickup {{is a type}} of {{magnetic}} transducer, or pickup, for the electric guitar and the electric bass.

5000|$|A {{side-by-side}} humbucking pickup senses a wider {{section of}} the string (has a wider aperture) than a single-coil pickup. This affects tone. By picking up a larger portion of the vibrating string more lower harmonics {{are present in the}} signal produced by the pickup in relation to high harmonics, resulting in a [...] "fatter" [...] tone. Humbucking pickups in the narrow form factor of a <b>single</b> <b>coil,</b> designed to replace single-coil pickups, have the narrower aperture resembling that of a <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> pickup. Some models of these single-coil-replacement humbuckers produce more authentic resemblances to classic <b>single</b> <b>coil</b> tones than full-size humbucking pickups of a similar inductance, which shows that the amount of high-frequency rolloff due to coil inductance is not the only factor in that sound.|$|R
