40|$|We study topological phase {{transitions}} in one dimensional (1 -D) Rashba nanowire under a spatially varying Zeeman field when coupled to an $s$-wave superconductor substrate. We {{show that this}} system supports both Majorana bound states (MBS) and fractionally charged bound states (FBS) of Jackiw-Rebbi type. By disassembling Zeeman Hamiltonian into multiple helical components, we find that each helical component is relating to a corresponding topological region, characterized {{by the emergence of}} MBS. FBS arises in the overlapping gapped area created by any two helical components with topologically differing configuration, analogous to those formed at the knot in SSH model. We then develop a general criteria for the occurrence conditions of MBS and FBS. Our results suggest that systems with large Rashba <b>spin</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>couple</b> amplitude or in presence of weak Zeeman fields favor MBS, and otherwise FBS are more favorable. In the end, we demonstrate that spin components of zero energy bound states in topological phases are polarized in the plane perpendicular to Rashba vector, and the polarization oscillates with the variance of phases of the Zeeman field.

40|$|We {{describe}} the charge transport in ferromagnets with <b>spin</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>coupled</b> Bloch bands {{by combining the}} wave-packet evolution equations with the classical Boltzmann equation. This approach can be justified {{in the limit of}} smooth disorder potential. Besides the skew scattering contribution, we demonstrate how other effects of disorder appear which are closely linked to the Berry curvature of the Bloch states associated with the wavepacket. We show that, although being of the same order of magnitude as the clean limit Berry curvature contribution, generally disorder corrections depend differently on various parameters and can lead to the sign reversal of the Hall current as the function of the chemical potential in systems with a non-constant Berry curvature in momentum space. Earlier conclusions on the effects of disorder on the anomalous Hall effect depended stricly on the lack of momentum dependence of the Berry curvature in the models studied and generalizations of their findings to other systems with more complicated band structures were unjustified.

The cavity introduces a quantum optical lattice potential which dynamically couples with the atomic degrees of freedom and realizes a generalized extended Bose Hubbard model whose zero temperature phase diagram can be controlled by tuning the cavity parameters. In the non-interacting limit, where the atom-atom interaction is set to zero, the resulting atomic dispersion shows interesting features such as bosonic analogue of Dirac points, cavity controlled Hofstadter spectrum which bears the hallmark of pseudo-spin- 1 / 2 bosons in presence of Abelian and non-Abelian gauge field (the later due to spin-orbit coupling) in a cavity induced optical lattice potential. In the presence of atom-atom interaction, using a mapping to a generalized Bose Hubbard model of spin-orbit coupled bosons in classical optical lattice, we show that the system realizes a host of quantum magnetic phases whose magnetic order can be be detected from the cavity transmission.

A series of nontrivial magnetotransport behaviors, {{resulting from a}} strong impact of phonons on skew scattering, is observed in these films with ultrathin ferromagnetic layers. The parameters representing skew scattering, side jump and intrinsic contributions are dramatically enhanced when the ferromagnetic layer is very thin, and they have clear linear dependences on the reciprocal of ferromagnetic layer thickness, indicating a powerful influence of Pt/Ferromagnet interface.
