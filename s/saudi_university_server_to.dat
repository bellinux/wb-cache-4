By migrating to cloud services, <b>Saudi</b> <b>universities</b> will be moving data and programs from local <b>servers</b> <b>to</b> the internet, thereby providing users with the ability to access and share information at any time from multiple devices. The migration to cloud-based IT resources is not yet widespread in <b>Saudi</b> <b>universities</b> due to several challenges including security, legal policies and implementation. At present, there is lack of research and guidance for <b>Saudi</b> <b>universities</b> on how to overcome these challenges and how contextual factors can influence the successful migration to the educational clouds. This research presents a framework for the successful migration to cloud technology in the <b>Saudi</b> Arabian <b>universities.</b> In this research, a set of key critical success factors (CSFs) were identified by synthesizing components from studies concerned with the migration of cloud for higher education and factors identified from the successful implementation of WBL (Web Based Learning) and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) on higher education in Saudi Arabia. Based on this knowledge, the proposed framework was evaluated via expert review and a survey by IT specialists from the <b>Saudi</b> <b>universities.</b> The initial CSFs were updated based on the expert reviews and the results were analysed. Based on the findings at this stage, additional CSFs were added to the framework as suggested by the experts. Subsequently, in order to confirm the reviewed CSFs, additional investigation via a structured online questionnaire was conducted and the outcome was analysed via one-sample t-test with the data integrity analysed via Cronbach’s alpha.

40|$|Web impact factors, the {{proposed}} web equivalent of impact factors for journals, {{can be calculated}} by using search engines. It {{has been found that}} the results are problematic because of the variable coverage of search engines as well as their ability to give significantly different results over short periods of time. The fundamental problem is that although some search engines provide a functionality that is capable of being used for impact calculations, this is not their primary task and therefore they do not give guarantees as to performance in this respect. In this paper, a bespoke web crawler designed specifically for the calculation of reliable WIFs is presented. This crawler was used to calculate WIFs for a number of UK universities, and the results of these calculations are discussed. The principal findings were that with certain restrictions, WIFs can be calculated reliably, but do not correlate with accepted research rankings owing to the variety of material hosted on <b>university</b> <b>servers.</b> Changes <b>to</b> the calculations to improve the fit of the results to research rankings are proposed, but there are still inherent problems undermining the reliability of the calculation. These problems still apply if the WIF scores are taken on their own as indicators of the general impact of any area of the Internet, but with care would not apply to online journals...|$|R

He began the MovieMistakes website in 1996 as a single page with a few listings and an email address. Following his move to Southampton University, he operated the site from the <b>university's</b> <b>server.</b> In 1998, a Times article on movie mistakes mentioned the site, leading {{to an increase in}} traffic. In 1999 the site outgrew the <b>university</b> <b>servers</b> and moved <b>to</b> a dedicated <b>server,</b> along with promotion and advertising to finance operations. On April 9, 2001 the site again grew in popularity following a Daily Mirror article on mistakes in the film Gladiator. On the same day, Sandys was invited to appear on the UK morning show The Big Breakfast to discuss movie mistakes, which became a weekly feature on the show until its cancellation. This exposure led to further interest in the website, the increased traffic leading to a temporary shutdown while the systems were upgraded. With these developments, Sandys began to work on the site on a full-time basis. By 2003 the site was averaging 26,000 hits a day and a then-record 100,000 hits in December 2003 when an article on mistakes in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King was posted on Slashdot, crashing the site server.

These measurements provide the means to critically analyze the library program and its operations and make specific recommendations for changes or improvements. The study applied three measures developed by Van House et al. (1990) : Facilities Use Rate, Services Points Use, and Reference Transactions. The study investigated if any significant differences existed in the use rates of services points and supportive facilities among the seven <b>Saudi</b> <b>university</b> libraries and between two designated groups [...] -large versus small universities. The study used different individual methods to collect the data: (1) interviews with librarians and department heads, (2) review of the literature and the related library documents and reports, and (3) masurement of the information services points and facilities. Based on the performance measurement data obtained, the average percentage use rate of facilities at the <b>Saudi</b> <b>universities</b> ranges from 17 % to 72 %. For the service points use rate, the average rate of users per employee for the service points' desks ranges from 0. 45 to 2. 05. For the reference transactions rate, the average rate of transactions per employee for the service points' desks ranges from 0. 77 to 7. 90. The study found that at least one of the seven libraries has a significantly different average use rate of facilities, a significantly different average user rate per employee of the service points' desks, and a significantly different average transaction rate per employee of the reference points' desks at <b>Saudi</b> <b>university</b> libraries. The study found that large and small <b>Saudi</b> <b>university</b> libraries have significantly different average usage rates of the facilities except copy machines, a significantly different average user rate per employee of the service points' desks, and a significantly different average transaction rate per employee of the reference points' desks at <b>Saudi</b> <b>university</b> libraries...|$|R

Therefore, this study aims to identify the role of employee relationship management (ERM) in developing staff word-of-mouth (SWOM) amongst seconded academic staff at <b>Saudi</b> <b>universities</b> through mediating employee dissent (ED). A survey questionnaire was prepared and distributed with a sample of 327 -seconded academic staff in 10 <b>Saudi</b> <b>universities.</b> The results point to partial support was found for the mediating effect of ED between ERM and SWOM. Therefore, ERM increasingly contributed in developing SWOM in the existence of articulated dissent. Meanwhile, this contribution decreases in the existence of both latent and displaced dissent. Even more surprisingly, the results showed that although ED is a relatively new concept, but it plays negatively and pivotally partial mediating role in the relationship between ERM and SWOM. These results suggested that managers within <b>Saudi</b> <b>universities</b> urgently need strategies to create an ambiance in which academic staff can feel a sense of voice to diminish negative ED and promote positive SWOM as an effective recruitment strategy.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted among medical students in five <b>Saudi</b> <b>universities.</b> This study was based on a survey undertaken in 2015. The survey consisted of five questions inquiring about the opinions and attitudes of medical students toward medical research. The same survey was carried out 8 years earlier in one of these universities (King Abdulaziz University [KAU]), and the results obtained during the two periods (2007 and 2015) were compared. Results: A convenient sample of 924 students was selected from five <b>Saudi</b> <b>universities.</b> Ninety-five (10. 3 %) of the medical students were not aware of the usefulness and importance scientific research will have on their future careers. A total of 409 (44. 3 %) stated that they had no knowledge on how to conduct scientific research. On the other hand, a vast majority of medical students (98. 1 %) expressed a willingness and interest to participate in scientific research if provided with an opportunity. The percentage of students from KAU strongly agreeing to participate in research rose from 33. 1 % in 2007 to 81. 5 % in 2015 (P= 0. 001).
