5|$|The docks {{maintenance}} {{facility was}} established {{on the land}} exposed by the damming of the river to construct the harbour and remains sited at this location to the present day. William Jessop had created a weir in the dam at Underfall to allow surplus water to flow back into the New Cut, this {{was known as the}} 'Overfall'. By the 1830s, the Floating Harbour was suffering from severe silting. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was, however, able to devise a solution to this problem. In place of the Overfall he advised better use of three shallow sluices and one deep scouring sluice between the harbour and the New Cut, together with a dredging vessel. This drag boat would scrape the silt away from the quay walls. When the deep sluice opened at low tide, a powerful undertow <b>sucked</b> <b>the</b> silt into the river to be carried away on the next tide. The shallow sluices enabled adjustment of the dock water level according to weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|Later, Judge Donnelly {{is nearly}} killed when {{she sits on}} a needle filled with {{potassium}} chloride at her home; she is saved when Stabler and Benson rush her to the hospital. O'Halloran tells Stabler and Benson that a mosquito <b>sucked</b> <b>the</b> blood from the killer {{as he or she}} was rigging Zimmer's car, and that the DNA from the blood will likely implicate Harrison. As the DNA is later being processed, however, O'Halloran is stabbed and killed by someone in the forensics lab. Stabler arrives and sees on the computer screen that the DNA matches Stuckey just before Stuckey knocks him out from behind. Stuckey then answers Elliot's phone when Benson calls to say that Stabler went out for lunch and forgot his phone. He then ties Stabler to a chair and starts torturing him. Stuckey admits he killed the woman at Coney Island in order to frame Harrison, and that he attacked Zimmer and Donnelly for embarrassing him. Benson arrives and is held at gunpoint by Stuckey, but she convinces Stuckey that she, too, hates Stabler and is in love with Stuckey. While Benson kisses Stuckey to distract him, Stabler kicks him from behind, allowing Benson to knock Stuckey out and free Stabler. When Stabler asks how Benson knew he was in trouble, Benson says that Stuckey told her he went out for sushi, which she knows that Stabler hates.|$|E
5|$|The Malaysian Penanggalan is a {{woman who}} {{obtained}} her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung jeruju (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A Kuntilanak or Matianak in Indonesia, or Pontianak or Langsuir in Malaysia, {{is a woman}} who died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole {{in the back of her}} neck, with which she <b>sucked</b> <b>the</b> blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming langsuir. This description would also fit the Sundel Bolongs.|$|E

25|$|While Bartlett {{continued}} his desperate manoeuvre, the ship listed more and more. The other crew members began {{to fear that}} the list would become too large, and {{so they decided to}} put the first lifeboat onto the water without waiting for the order to do so. Bartlett then decided to stop the ship and her engine. However, before he could do so, two lifeboats were put onto the water on the port side. The still-turning propellers <b>sucked</b> <b>the</b> two lifeboats into it, crushing them along with their passengers. Bartlett was then finally able to stop the propellers before they could suck in another lifeboat.|$|E
25|$|During the 5000km journey across Africa {{through some}} of its most {{difficult}} country consisting of almost impenetrable rainforest and swamps, Stairs and colleagues suffered frequently from malaria and dysentery. Stairs had endurance, toughness and perseverance. He discovered one source of the Nile, the Semliki River, and became the first non-African to ever climb in the Ruwenzoris, reaching 10,677ft before having to turn around. He was seriously wounded in the chest by a poisonous arrow during an attack by natives, many of whom assumed they were a slave-raiding party, and the expedition killed hundreds in return. Stairs recovered from his wound to continue the journey. In Dublin, Ireland there is a bronze plaque depicting this 13 August 1887 event on the statue of expedition Surgeon Major Thomas Heazle Parke who removed the arrow and <b>sucked</b> <b>the</b> poison from the wound.|$|E
25|$|He argued infants were {{engaging}} {{in an act}} of assimilation when they sucked on everything in their reach. He claimed infants transform all objects into an object to be <b>sucked.</b> <b>The</b> children were assimilating the objects to conform to their own mental structures. Piaget then made the assumption that whenever one transforms the world to meet individual needs or conceptions, one is, in a way, assimilating it. Piaget also observed his children not only assimilating objects to fit their needs, but also modifying some of their mental structures {{to meet the demands of}} the environment. This is the second division of adaptation known as accommodation. To start out, the infants only engaged in primarily reflex actions such as sucking, but not long after, they would pick up objects and put them in their mouths. When they do this, they modify their reflex response to accommodate the external objects into reflex actions. Because the two are often in conflict, they provide the impetus for intellectual development. The constant need to balance the two triggers intellectual growth.|$|E
40|$|Nutritive and {{non-nutritive sucking}} was studied in 9 preterm infants with {{postmenstrual}} ages ranging from 28 to 33 weeks and postnatal ages ranging from 0 to 8 weeks. During nutritive sucking, sucking bursts were longer than sucking pauses. During non-nutritive <b>sucking</b> <b>the</b> opposite was seen. <b>The</b> <b>sucking</b> rate was lower during nutritive sucking. During nutritive <b>sucking</b> <b>the</b> respiratory rate was higher during the pauses {{than during the}} bursts. During non-nutritive <b>sucking</b> <b>the</b> respiratory rate was higher during sucking. It is concluded that non-nutritive sucking cannot {{serve as a model}} for studying feeding mechanisms in the preterm infant. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|After {{flashing}} over in {{the ballroom}} (which witnesses confused with an explosion), the super-heated gases swept up the grand staircase into {{the lobby of the}} hotel. From there, the fire was drawn through the open doors of the casino by the smoke-eaters (devices in the ceiling that <b>sucked</b> <b>the</b> smoke from cigarettes out of the room) present throughout the casino. With more than 150 guests estimated to be in the casino when the fire broke out, most of the deaths occurred in that area. Several months before the fire, hotel management had had the emergency exit doors locked to prevent theft, and the only other way out was through a pair of inward-opening doors. Some people pressed against the doors to no avail. Others leaped from the second-story casino through plate-glass windows to the pool deck below; many were injured. Others died of smoke inhalation on upper floors of the casino. Still others were killed as they rode the elevators to the lobby, only to discover their path blocked by the fire when the doors opened. Those who were able to do so climbed to the hotel's roof, where an improvised helicopter rescue, including civilian, Commonwealth Police, Puerto Rico National Guard, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Navy helicopters from the Roosevelt Roads Naval Air Station, transported people to safety.|$|E

500|$|The reinvention of {{the vampire}} myth {{in the modern}} era is not without {{political}} overtones. The aristocratic Count Dracula, alone in his castle apart from a few demented retainers, appearing only at night to feed on his peasantry, is symbolic of the parasitic ancien regime.

Columnist Brian Lowry wrote in Los Angeles Times, [...] "This year the mystery far outweighed the magic, in a telecast that proved less compelling--indeed, during stretches more downright dull--than recent predecessors."

[...] The Star-Ledgers Alan Sepinwall noted, [...] "Crystal was a bundle of energy, but his jokes had less zing than in the past." [...] He also observed that the Film Editing dance number and [...] "That Thing You Do" [...] musical performance were hideously bloated.|$|E

The protagonist is among those trapped in the school, along with fellow students Reiko Akanezawa, Yumi Shirakawa, Shinji [...] "Charlie" [...] Kuroi and Akira Miyamoto. Should the protagonist side with Yumi or Shinji, they navigate the demon-infested school and towers, finally confronting and killing Hazama.

If the Protagonist allied with Reiko, they enter the Demon Emperor's mind after he is first defeated, and see Hazama's motivations for his actions. Reiko, a relative of Hazama, calms him and stays with him in the Expanse while the protagonist is teleported back to the human world and the school is returned to normal. In another route unlocked on a second playthrough, the protagonist can ally with Akira, who seeks vengeance against the demons who <b>sucked</b> <b>the</b> school into the Expanse. Travelling to the Land of Nomos, Akira is killed and possessed by the demon Amon, who after defeating Hazama takes his place as the Demon God Emperor, sending the protagonist back to the human world alone.|$|E
