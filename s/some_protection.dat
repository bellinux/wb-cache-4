5|$|Like {{some other}} {{grassland}} psilocybin mushroom {{species such as}} P.mexicana, P.tampanensis and Conocybe cyanopus, P.semilanceata may form sclerotia, a dormant form of the fungus, which affords it <b>some</b> <b>protection</b> from wildfires and other natural disasters. The German mycologist Jochen Gartz even succeeded in producing sclerotia on a malt agar surface culture.|$|E
5|$|During the 1906 {{legislative}} session, Beckham urged {{investigation and}} prosecution of corrupt insurance companies, {{following the lead of}} New York attorney Charles Evans Hughes. In particular, he recommended reducing the practice of deferred dividends, which allowed the insurance companies to keep large stores of cash on-hand for illegal purposes. He further advocated that insurance companies doing business in the state be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in Kentucky, bolstering the its economy and providing policyholders <b>some</b> <b>protection</b> against fraud.|$|E
5|$|For newly emerged {{adults of}} most {{myrmecophilous}} Lycaenidae, deciduous waxy scales provide <b>some</b> <b>protection</b> from predators as they {{emerge from the}} nest. In {{the case of the}} moth butterfly (Liphyra brassolis), the caterpillars are unwelcome guests in nests of tree ants, feeding on ant larvae. The adults emerging from pupae are covered with soft, loose adhesive scales which rub off and stick on the ants as they make {{their way out of the}} nest after hatching.|$|E

5|$|In some colonial polyps, a chitinous {{periderm}} gives {{support and}} <b>some</b> <b>protection</b> to the connecting sections {{and to the}} lower parts of individual polyps. Stony corals secrete massive calcium carbonate exoskeletons. A few polyps collect materials such as sand grains and shell fragments, which they attach to their outsides. Some colonial sea anemones stiffen the mesoglea with sediment particles.|$|E
5|$|Like {{some other}} psychoactive {{grassland}} {{species such as}} Psilocybe semilanceata, Conocybe cyanopus, P.tampanensis can form sclerotia–a hardened mass of mycelia that is more resistant to adverse environmental conditions than normal mycelia. This truffle-like form gives the fungus <b>some</b> <b>protection</b> from wildfires and other natural disasters. Other Psilocybe species known to produce sclerotia include Psilocybe mexicana and Psilocybe caerulescens. Sclerotia are also produced when the species is grown in culture.|$|E
5|$|Streamside camps offered wood, water, and <b>some</b> <b>protection</b> {{from the}} hazards of open land. The prairie could be {{dangerous}} in time of native unrest, and trade ceased entirely for a time during the Dakota War of 1862. Prairie fires, driven by winds, were a risk in dry spells. Wet weather turned rivers into torrents, approaches to streams into bogs, and worn paths into morasses. Blizzards could strand traders and threaten them with starvation. Insects harassed both the traders and their draft animals, depriving them of sleep and weakening them.|$|E
50|$|The {{legal system}} in Sudan {{is based on}} Islamic Sharia law. The 2005 Naivasha Agreement, ending the civil war {{between north and south}} Sudan, {{established}} <b>some</b> <b>protections</b> for non-Muslims in Khartoum. Sudan's application of Sharia law is geographically inconsistent.|$|R

5|$|Sufficient habitat {{complexity}} is {{a crucial}} requirement {{for the presence of}} this species, in order to support its various behaviours-basking, foraging, and hibernation—as well as to offer <b>some</b> <b>protection</b> from predators and human harassment. It is found in a variety of habitats, including: chalky downs, rocky hillsides, moors, sandy heaths, meadows, rough commons, edges of woods, sunny glades and clearings, bushy slopes and hedgerows, dumps, coastal dunes, and stone quarries. It will venture into wetlands if dry ground is available nearby and thus may be found on the banks of streams, lakes, and ponds.|$|E
5|$|The inaccessibility of its habitat affords <b>some</b> <b>protection</b> for A.bradleyi. Quarrying {{and strip}} mining may {{threaten}} the sandstone cliffs, {{especially on the}} Cumberland Plateau. Rock climbers and botanical collectors have also damaged populations of the fern. Toxic runoff from atop cliffs can affect them, and {{they may also be}} threatened by both natural and anthropogenic shading of cliffs due to increased tree growth at the cliff base, invasive vines overrunning the cliff face, or the piling of slash against the cliff after logging.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 12th century, Angkor Wat {{gradually}} {{transformed from}} a Hindu centre of worship to Buddhism, which continues to the present day. Angkor Wat is unusual among the Angkor temples in that although it was somewhat neglected after the 16th century it was never completely abandoned, its preservation being {{due in part to the}} fact that its moat also provided <b>some</b> <b>protection</b> from encroachment by the jungle.|$|E

5|$|A narrow quay passes {{under the}} old swivel section of the bridge from Waller's Quay to the marina. A well-worn {{handrail}} offers the pedestrian <b>some</b> <b>protection</b> against a slip into the river. This rail has been known as the Duke's Rail since in 1897 the then Duke of York, later to become George V, paid a state visit to Ireland. The royal party travelled up-river from Portumna on the steamship Countess of Mayo. Disembarking at Waller's Quay, the Duke was received by Lord Rosse, the Lord Lieutenant of King's County. The party had to traverse the narrow quay under the bridge to get to Banagher Railway Station, and undoubtedly made good use of the Duke's Rail. The stretch of the Shannon from Portumna to Banagher was {{known for some time}} after as the Duke of York's Route.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they grow}} {{naturally}} on deep sandy soils, the species has proved adaptable to other deep, well-drained soils, especially where natural slopes assist drainage. Despite their natural occurrence in woodland, waratahs flower best in full sun, although they tolerate the dappled shade of eucalypts. Heavy pruning after flowering reinvigorates {{the plants and}} promotes more profuse flowering in the next season. Waratah blooms are highly susceptible to damage from wind, and benefit from <b>some</b> <b>protection</b> from prevailing winds. Waratah blooms attract birds to the garden. The species is readily propagated from fresh seed, but cultivars must be reproduced from cuttings to remain true-to-type.|$|E
5|$|As an {{alternative}} to the time-consuming task of creating a breach, an escalade could be attempted to capture the walls with fighting along the walkways behind the battlements. In this instance, attackers would be vulnerable to arrowfire. A safer option for those assaulting a castle was to use a siege tower, sometimes called a belfry. Once ditches around a castle were partially filled in, these wooden, movable towers could be pushed against the curtain wall. As well as offering <b>some</b> <b>protection</b> for those inside, a siege tower could overlook the interior of a castle, giving bowmen an advantageous position from which to unleash missiles.|$|E

5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in a person's {{disposition}} to SAH; risk is increased three- to fivefold in first-degree relatives of people having had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, lifestyle factors are more important in determining overall risk. These risk factors are smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), and excessive alcohol consumption. Having smoked in the past confers a doubled risk of SAH compared to those who have never smoked. <b>Some</b> <b>protection</b> of uncertain significance is conferred by caucasian ethnicity, hormone replacement therapy, and diabetes mellitus. There is likely an inverse relationship between total serum cholesterol and the risk of non-traumatic SAH, though confirmation of this association is hindered by a lack of studies. Approximately 4 percent of aneurysmal bleeds occur after sexual intercourse and 10 percent of people with SAH are bending over or lifting heavy objects at the onset of their symptoms.|$|E
5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which {{had gone out of}} favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on his head in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, <b>some</b> <b>protection,</b> although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E
5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{although}} these {{are hard to}} obtain. Seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take around 23 days to germinate. Cuttings yield unpredictable results. The plant itself prefers a deep, sandy, well-drained soil with a pH of 6.0–7.0. It requires full sun, but <b>some</b> <b>protection</b> from the wind is recommended, as this is a fast-growing plant with spindly branches that are easily damaged by wind. A more compact form {{can be obtained by}} pruning the top quarter each year. This species has little appeal to the cut flower industry because of its prickly foliage, and its tendency to drip nectar.|$|E
50|$|States {{differ on}} their {{approach}} to protecting reporter's privilege. , 49 states and the District of Columbia offer <b>some</b> form of <b>protections</b> Forty states (plus D.C.) have passed shield laws.

Other laws protect journalists from revealing confidential sources, but not other information. Many states have also established court precedents which provide protection to journalists, usually based on constitutional arguments. Only Wyoming lacks both legislation and judicial precedent to protect reporter's privilege.|$|R

5|$|Smallpox {{vaccination}} {{within three}} days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms {{in the vast majority}} of people. Vaccination four to seven days after exposure can offer <b>some</b> <b>protection</b> from disease or may modify the severity of disease. Other than vaccination, treatment of smallpox is primarily supportive, such as wound care and infection control, fluid therapy, and possible ventilator assistance. Flat and hemorrhagic types of smallpox are treated with the same therapies used to treat shock, such as fluid resuscitation. People with semi-confluent and confluent types of smallpox may have therapeutic issues similar to patients with extensive skin burns.|$|E
5|$|Some prey {{animals such as}} zebra {{are marked}} with high-contrast {{patterns}} which possibly help to confuse their predators, such as lions, during a chase. The bold stripes of a herd of running Zebra have been claimed {{make it difficult for}} predators to estimate the prey's speed and direction accurately, or to identify individual animals, giving the prey an improved chance of escape. Since dazzle patterns (such as the Zebra's stripes) make animals harder to catch when moving, but easier to detect when stationary, there is an evolutionary trade-off between dazzle and camouflage. Another theory is that the zebra's stripes could provide <b>some</b> <b>protection</b> from flies and biting insects.|$|E
5|$|The {{carriage}} {{was nearly}} identical to the carriage of the M-30. It had suspension and steel wheels with pneumatic rubber tires. The trails were initially of riveted construction, but were eventually replaced in production by welded ones. Late production pieces were equipped with caster wheels to ease manhandling. Time to set up for combat was about two minutes. In an emergency {{it was possible to}} fire without splitting trails; however this was at the price of a drastically reduced traverse (1°30'). Since the gun was not equipped with a limber, it could be towed only by vehicle. The maximum towing speed was 40km/h on paved roads, 30km/h on cobbled roads and 10km/h off-road. To give the crew <b>some</b> <b>protection</b> from bullets and shell fragments, the gun was fitted with a shield.|$|E
