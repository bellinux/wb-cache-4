25|$|Whether {{from the}} {{impression}} that even thus the comic element needed strengthening, or from the very natural desire to provide a good part for Mr. Denny, the author has introduced, in the M'Crankie, a figure which, though wholly unnecessary {{to the development of}} the plot, and in his surprising mixture of Scottish characteristics scarcely credible in any period, will probably have as much to <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> success of the new piece as any of the characters. It is true that the absurdities of the part would be more acceptable in one of the frankly extravagant inventions of the older librettist than in a more professedly historical, and one which presents in all other respects, faithful pictures of the place and period chosen.|$|E

25|$|Now, imagine {{starting}} at the bottom left corner of the phase diagram, in the vacuum where μ=T=0. If we heat up the system without introducing any preference for quarks over antiquarks, this corresponds to moving vertically upwards along the T axis. At first, quarks are still confined and we create a gas of hadrons (pions, mostly). Then around T=150MeV there is a crossover to the quark gluon plasma: thermal fluctuations break up the pions, and we find a gas of quarks, antiquarks, and gluons, as well as lighter particles such as photons, electrons, positrons, etc. Following this path corresponds to travelling far back in time (so to <b>say),</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state of the universe shortly {{after the big bang}} (where there was a very tiny preference for quarks over antiquarks).|$|E
25|$|Count Benedetti {{spoke to}} me on the promenade, in order to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to {{telegraph}} at once that I bound myself for all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout jamais. Naturally I told him that I had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since received a letter from the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to your Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.|$|E

500|$|The new line-up rehearsed in Dallas for a North American tour, {{starting}} in London, Ontario.

However, certain media publications have labelled Kapoor a recluse and described him as arrogant and temperamental.

[...] In June 2009, Silberling confirmed he still talked about the project with Handler, and suggested the sequel be a stop motion film because the lead actors have grown too old.

500|$|At {{four o'clock}} in the morning of 21 October Nelson ordered the Victory to turn towards the {{approaching}} enemy fleet, and signalled the rest of his force to battle stations. He then went below and made his will, before returning to the quarterdeck to carry out an inspection. Despite having 27 ships to Villeneuve's 33, Nelson was confident of success, declaring {{that he would not be}} satisfied with taking fewer than 20 prizes. He returned briefly to his cabin to write a final prayer, after which he joined Victory’s signal lieutenant, John Pasco. Mr Pasco, I wish to <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fleet [...] "England confides that every man will do his duty". You must be quick, for I have one more signal to make, which is for close action. Pasco suggested changing confides to expects which, being in the Signal Book, could be signalled by the use of a single code (using three flags), whereas confides would have to be spelt out letter by letter. Nelson agreed, and the signal was hoisted.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written to humanize Sawyer {{and set up}} the love {{triangle}} between him, Kate and Jack. Kate was meant to look at Sawyer in a new way, and, according to Lindelof, think, [...] "wow, this guy is not just a belligerent." [...] The episode also shows the moral ambiguity of some characters by revealing more of their personalities, with the ones introduced as protagonists doing things that are generally not viewed as protagonist-like– an example being Jack beating Sawyer and eventually asking Sayid to torture him; and an antagonistic character, Sawyer, proving not to be solely antagonist-like– an example being his backstory and flashback, which show that he is not exclusively evil. Lindelof explained that he wanted Sawyer to [...] "come out of his shell a little, and <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience, 'you're supposed to like this guy'", further explaining, [...] "the root of him being an asshole is that these horrible things happened to him {{when he was a little}} kid, and he's really really angry." ...|$|E

[...] Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez believed that Liverpool would have won the match had they scored when they were leading 1–0: [...] "If you have clear chances at 1–0 and you score the second goal you finish the game, but we made some mistakes and at the end we conceded in our own goal." [...] Despite the defeat he was proud of his players' efforts: [...] "I <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> players we must be proud because we played a good game, Chelsea controlled the game when they started playing, but we re-organised the team with three midfielders and had some opportunities." ...|$|E
