Final separation of the fibre is accomplished by a breaking process in which the brittle woody portion of the straw is broken, either by hand or by passing through rollers, followed by the scutching operation, which removes the broken woody pieces (shives) by beating or scraping. Some machines combine breaking and scutching operations. Waste material from the first scutching, consisting of shives and short fibres, is usually treated a second time.

5000|$|The linen {{should be}} sown in March, in the {{beginning}} of the Spring season. In the Summer, the harvest is done - people pull out the linen, to make good use the textile fiber, which is found in the stalk. Then, we must hackle the linen, which consist of taking of the seed with the “ripo” (a comb made of iron). The next action is to soak - the linen stays for two weeks in current but not very strong water. Then, it will dry in a previously cut and cleaned field. The linen balls are placed on the field. Once dry, the linen is scutched. This action is made in “espadeladouro”, with a flax-comb (a wooden board and a hive (cylinder made of cork). The purpose is to separate the fibres. The linters are taken out (rough, thick and <b>short</b> <b>fibre,</b> which is also used to make some kind cloth, like mattress liners, kitchen rags and flour sacs). The fibre that remains, after the separation of the linters, is put in a machine, which repeatedly tramples the linen in the river. The linen can also be made with a maul. In this way the linen is squeezed. Now it is time to go to the next step, which consists of putting the fibre that remained in a machine that softens the linen and makes it glossy, separating the linen from the cotton waste (that remains trapped inside the machine making the linen become finer). The linen is now ready to be sharpened. For its spinning, the distaff and the spinning wheel are used, turning the fibre into thread.|$|E

Wear tests are conducted on a pin-on-disc set-up under dry sliding condition having a constant sliding velocity of 0. 837 m/s for a constant sliding distance of 2. 5 km in the load range of 10 - 40 N. It is observed that the wear rate increases with increase in load for the alloy and the composites, as expected. Wear rate of the composites {{is lower than the}} alloy and the hybrid composites exhibit a lower wear rate than the Saffil <b>short</b> <b>fibres</b> reinforced composite at all the loads. Therefore, the partial replacement of Saffil <b>short</b> <b>fibres</b> by an equal volume fraction of SiC particles not only reduces the cost but also improves the wear resistance of the composite. Microstructural investigation of the surface and subsurface of the worn pin and wear debris is carried out to explain the observed results and to understand the wear mechanisms. It is concluded that the presence of SiC particles in the hybrid composites improves the wear resistance because these particles remain intact and retain their load bearing capacity even at the highest load employed, they promote the formation of iron-rich transfer layer and they also delay the fracture of Saffil <b>short</b> <b>fibres</b> to higher loads. Under the experimental conditions used in the present investigation, the dominant wear mechanism is found to be abrasion for the AE 42 alloy and its composites.

40|$|The OFDA 4000 {{is a new}} {{instrument}} for the measurement of fibre length and diameter of wool tops. The instrument has undergone several modifications and improvements since {{it was first reported}} at the Barcelona IWTO meeting. The instrument can measure various fibre types in sliver form and now has the capacity to measure fibre snippets on the 70 mm glass slides as used by the OFDA 100. The OFDA 4000 measurements were compared to Almeter measurements on 43 commercial tops. The OFDA 4000 estimates of hauteur and CvH closely matched those of the Almeter. Because the OFDA 4000 directly counts fibres within the drawn sample, another estimate of fibre length distribution can be determined (now called mean fibre length). This estimate of mean fibre length was poorly correlated to the hauteur estimate made by Almeter for the 43 tops. Furthermore, there was a very poor relationship between <b>short</b> <b>fibre</b> content (% Fibres < 25 mm) estimated by the length method of the OFDA 4000, and the estimates of <b>short</b> <b>fibre</b> content made by the Almeter.

40|$|Determining the {{mechanical}} properties of <b>short</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced CMC using standard sized coupons {{has always been}} a challenge due to a high statistical scattering of the measured values. Although the random orientation of short fibres results in a quasi-isotropic material behavior of 2 D-structures with a sufficiently large volume, the small volume typical for test coupons usually results in a non-isotropic fibre orientation in the tested volume. This paper describes a method for manufacturing unidirectional oriented <b>short</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced CMC materials and presents material properties of UD-C/C-SiC. After verifying the fibre orientation of the CMC using micro-computed tomography, coupons were extracted to determine the orthotropic material properties. These orthotropic material properties were then used to predict the properties of C/C-SiC with randomly distributed short fibres. To validate the method, micro-computed tomography is used to quantitatively determine the fibre orientation within coupons extracted from randomly distributed <b>short</b> <b>fibre</b> C/C-SiC. After mechanical three-point-bending tests, the measured stiffness and bending strength is compared with the predicted properties.

40|$|Carbon fibre {{reinforced}} Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC) on {{the basis}} of woven fabrics are well known from the development of highly complex and thin walled structures for heat shields of reusable spacecrafts. Since 1988, DLR has developed so called C/C-SiC materials via a three step manufacturing route based on the infiltration of liquid silicon into porous carbon/carbon. Especially for automotive brake disks, the costs of the carbon fabrics and of the common processing techniques for the CFRP preform, like resin transfer moulding or autoclave technique, are too high for a serial production. The most promising way to reduce the costs for the brake disks and to simplify the CFRP manufacture is using a <b>short</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforcement and applying hot pressing techniques.

40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, MMCs have been {{fabricated}} using the creep-resistant AE 42 magnesium alloy as matrix and reinforcing it with saffil <b>short</b> <b>fibres</b> (essentially δ-Al 2 O 2) and SiC particles in various combinations. These MMCs {{have been investigated}} for their creep, wear and corrosion behaviour. The above properties of the matrix AE 42 alloy have also been investigated for comparison. Further, laser surface melting {{has been carried out}} on a creep-resistant MRI 230 D Mg alloy and the corrosion and wear behaviour of this alloy before and after laser surface melting has been investigated. The creep tests on the AE 42 alloy were carried out in the temperature range of 1500 to 2400 C at the stress levels ranging from 40 to 120 MPa and the composites were tested in the temperature range of 1750 C to 3000 at the stress levels ranging from 60 to 140 MPa both in the longitudinal direction (LD) and in the transverse direction (TD). Wear tests were conducted on a pin-on-disc set-up under dry sliding condition at a constant sliding velocity of 0. 837 m/s for a constant sliding distance of 2. 5 km in the load range of 10 to 40 N for the AE 42 alloy and the composites, which were tested both in LD and TD, and for a constant sliding distance of 1 km in the load range of 5 to 20 N for the MRI 230 D alloy before and after laser melting. All the materials were subjected to electrochemical corrosion tests in a 5 wt. % NaCl solution having ph value 11 for 22 hours. All the composites in both LD and TD exhibit lower creep rate as compared to the AE 42 alloy and it is higher in TD than in LD. The creep resistance of the hybrid composites, in which saffil <b>short</b> <b>fibres</b> are partially replaced by SiC particles, is observed to be comparable, i. e., of the same order of magnitude, to that of the composite reinforced with Saffil <b>short</b> <b>fibres</b> alone at all the temperatures and stresses employed in both LD and TD. Wear rate of all the composites in both LD and Td is found to be lower than the alloy at all the loads employed and it is higher in TD than LD, Wear rate progressively decreases with the partial replacement of Saffil <b>short</b> <b>fibres</b> by Sic Particles, and is lowest for the composites reinforced with 10 vol. % Saffil <b>short</b> <b>fibres</b> and 15 vol. % Sic particles in both LD and TD. It is 34 % and 35 % lower than the 20 % Saffil composite at 40 N load in LD and TD, respectively. The Ae 42 alloy exhibits the best corrosion resistance and the addition of the Saffil <b>short</b> <b>fibres</b> and/or Sic particles in the AE 42 alloy deteriorates its corrosion resitance. The composite reinforced with Saffil <b>short</b> <b>fibres</b> alone exhibits slightly better corrosion resitance than the hybrid composites. However, there is no systematic trend of corrosion resistance with SiC particles content. The laser surface melting is found to improve the corrosion, hardness and wear resistance of the MRI 230 D alloy. High temperature climb of dislocation is found to be the dominant creep mechanism in the AE 42 alloy in the stress and temperature range employed. Various glide and climb of dislocation are found to be the dominant creep mechanisms for all the composites in both LD and TD in the stress and temperature range employed. The presence of SiC particles in the hybrid composites improves the wear resistance in both LD and TD since these particles remain intact and retain their load bearing capacity even at the highest load employed in the present investigation. They promote the formation of iron-rich transfer layer and they also delay the fracture of Saffil <b>short</b> <b>fibres</b> to higher loads in case of the composites in LD. Under the experimental conditions used in the present investigation, the dominant wear mechanism is found to be abrasion for the AE 42 alloy and its composites in both LD and TD. It is accompanied by severe plastic deformation of surface layers in case of the alloy, the fracture of Saffil <b>short</b> <b>fibres</b> as well as the formation of iron-rich transfer layer in case of the composites in Ld, and the fracture and pull-out of the Saffil <b>short</b> <b>fibres</b> in case of the composites in TD. The lower corrosion resistance of all the composites is not caused by the galvanic coupling between reinforcements and matrix, and is related to the microstructural changes, such as, distribution of precipitates {{and the nature of the}} film formed at the surface. The improved corrosion resistance following laser surface melting is due to the absence of the Al 2 Ca phase at the grain boundary, microstructural refinement and increased solid solubility, particularly of Al, owing to rapid solidification; the improved hardness and wear resistance is due to grain refinement and solid solution strengthening. To conclude, the creep resistance of the hybrid composites is comparable, wear resistance is better and corrosion resistance is slightly inferior to the composite reinforced with Saffil <b>short</b> <b>fibres</b> alone. Therefore, from the commercial point of view, the use of the hybrid composites, replacing a part of the expensive Saffil <b>short</b> <b>fibres</b> by cheap SiC particles, is beneficial.
