In addition, the attitudes of Japanese university students towards loanwords are examined using information gathered from the results of a questionnaire. The study showed that Japanese university students did not have a negative view of English loanwords but often have difficulty in understanding them, and thus think that more attention should be paid to teaching loanwords in school. Some practical suggestions are given as to how loanwords should be approached and used as an effective tool for teaching English...|$|E

Its efficiency in selecting a small subset of geographic features from a large feature collection is undebatable. But {{there is a problem}} with the strategy: For a pure overlap test in the filter phase, the filter/refine strategy gets less optimal as the query window grows larger. Loosely <b>speaken,</b> the reason for this is that the candidates falling completely within the area of the query window are not included in the result although a decision can be made from the filter phase. We argue that an overlap test followed by an inside test will reduce the query costs from quadratic to linear as the query window doubles in north- and east dimension. A study on the Land-use resource data set in Norway (DMK) gives an indication of this. ...|$|E

40|$|Levels of {{linguistic}} {{structure and the}} rate of change Until recently, most studies of language change have nec€ssadly tteated one area of language at a time: phonology, grammar, or the leicon. r At present, however, we know relatively little about relationships between changes in different areas of language structue. We do know, for example, that c€rtain types of vocabulary are more resistent to replacement han others, that cer-tain morphological configurations are more susceptible to analogic leveling than othen, and that certain combinations of syntactic rules are morc stable than othe$, but we have as yet had little opportunity to comPare functionally equivalent changes {{in different parts of the}} grammar. Just such an opportuniiy exists among the Northem Iroquoian languages' Two sets of mechanisms intenct pervasively tfuoughout all levels of struc-ture in all of these languages. One set reflects primarily the speaker's evalua' tion of the hearer's knowledge. Speakers exploit these mechanisms primarily to arange infomation in such a way as to be most easily and readily under-stood. The other set, sometimes termed evidential, reflects the speaker's evaluation of his/her own knowledge, i. e., the reliabitty of the information communicated. Both types of distinctions, the assesment of hearers ' and <b>speaken</b> ' knowledge, are marked by syntactic, morphological, predicate, and particle devices in all of the Northem Iroquoian languages.
