25|$|Typical surfing {{instruction}} is best performed one-on-one, {{but can also}} {{be done in a}} group setting. The most popular surf locations offer perfect surfing conditions for beginners, as well as challenging breaks for advanced students. The ideal conditions for learning would be small waves that crumble and break <b>softly,</b> <b>as</b> opposed to the steep, fast-peeling waves desired by more experienced surfers. When available, a sandy seabed is generally safer.|$|E
500|$|In 1963, Sinatra {{reunited with}} Nelson Riddle for The Concert Sinatra, an ambitious album {{featuring}} a 73-piece symphony orchestra arranged and conducted by Riddle. The concert was recorded on a motion picture scoring soundstage {{with the use}} of multiple synchronized recording machines that employed an optical signal onto 35mm film designed for movie soundtracks. Granata considers the album to have been [...] "impeachable" [...] , [...] "one of the very best of the Sinatra-Riddle ballad albums", in which Sinatra displayed an impressive vocal range, particularly in [...] "Ol' Man River", in which he darkened the hue. [...] In 1964 the song [...] "My Kind of Town" [...] was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Sinatra released <b>Softly,</b> <b>as</b> I Leave You, and collaborated with Bing Crosby and Fred Waring on America, I Hear You Singing, a collection of patriotic songs recorded as a tribute to the assassinated President John F. Kennedy. Sinatra increasingly became involved in charitable pursuits in this period. In 1961 and 1962 he went to Mexico, with the sole purpose of putting on performances for Mexican charities, and in July 1964 he was present for the dedication of the Frank Sinatra International Youth Center for Arab and Jewish children in Nazareth.|$|E
500|$|On 6 June 1950 Jacques {{was cast}} in the first episode of the weekly radio show Educating Archie as Agatha Dinglebody. The [...] "Archie" [...] of the title was the ventriloquist's dummy Archie Andrews, {{operated}} by Peter Brough. The first series ran for 29 weeks until 19 December. In the show Jacques appeared alongside Max Bygraves, Julie Andrews, Beryl Reid and—in the second series—Tony Hancock. It was on this programme that she first worked with Eric Sykes, who was providing scripts for the series. Sykes had been impressed with Jacques since he visited the Players' in 1948. He later wrote that she [...] "moved about the stage with an elegance and grace as if she owned it. At {{the end of her}} act, to great applause, she leapt in the air, finishing in the splits, landing as <b>softly</b> <b>as</b> a snowflake in July". After the show Sykes was introduced to Jacques backstage and thought that the meeting was [...] "the beginning of a new flight" [...] in his professional life. At the end of the series Jacques returned to the Players' to appear in the Christmas pantomime, Ali Baba and the Thirty-nine Thieves, which she and Joan Sterndale-Bennett had adapted after they had copied it out long-hand at the British Museum. The reviewer in The Times thought that Jacques was [...] "as appealing as last year", in her performance as Ali Baba's wife, Cogia.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Leland, {{with an air}} of reflection, [...] "haven't you hair <b>as</b> <b>softly</b> dusky <b>as</b> the sky up there, {{and eyes}} so deep and clear that one can see the {{wholesome}} thoughts down in the depths of them? Haven't you hands and arms that look like alabaster, until one feels the gracious warmth beneath?" ...|$|R
60|$|Madame Tobain--she told me her name--shook {{her head}} once more. She spoke <b>softly,</b> almost <b>as</b> {{though she were}} {{speaking}} of something sacred.|$|R

2500|$|During {{his early}} radio shows, {{there was no}} {{recurring}} theme, the program instead opening each week with a different then-current popular song. Throughout the Jello and Grapenuts years, announcer Don Wilson would announce {{the name of the}} show, some of the cast, then state [...] "The orchestra opens the program with [...]" [...] The orchestra number would continue <b>softly</b> <b>as</b> background for Don Wilson's opening commercial.|$|E
2500|$|Dry flies may be [...] "attractors", {{such as the}} Royal Wulff, or [...] "natural imitators", such as the elk hair caddis, a caddisfly {{imitation}} A beginner {{may wish}} {{to begin with a}} fly that is easy to see such as a Royal Wulff attractor or a mayfly imitation such as a parachute adams. The [...] "parachute" [...] on the parachute adams makes the fly land as <b>softly</b> <b>as</b> a natural on the water and has the added benefit of making the fly very visible from the surface. Being able to see the fly is especially helpful to the beginner. The fly should land <b>softly,</b> <b>as</b> if dropped onto the water, with the leader fully extended from the fly line. Due to rivers having faster and slower currents often running side by side, the fly can over take or be overtaken by the line, thus disturbing the fly's drift. Mending is a technique whereby one lifts and moves the part of the line that requires re-aligning with the fly's drift, thus extending the drag free drift. The mend can be upstream or down stream depending on the currents carrying the line or fly. To be effective, any mending of the fly line should not disturb the natural drift of the fly. Learning to mend is often much easier if the angler can see the fly.|$|E

60|$|With {{a gesture}} of acquiescent anguish and despair, he let her pass, held open the door, and closed it <b>softly,</b> so <b>as</b> not to awaken the happy sleeper.|$|R
6000|$|He {{places a}} cushion for her, and prepares tea; {{she looks up}} at [...] him <b>softly,</b> but <b>as</b> he {{finishes}} and turns to her, she drops that [...] glance.|$|R
2500|$|.....with a {{starry night}} and clear, without a {{cloud in the}} sky, there was heard in all the island a grandioso and {{spontaneous}} tremor of earth, that lasted for {{the space of a}} creed, that appeared that the elements, fire, air and water, fought at the centre, making them great concussions, with snorting and horrendous movements, like raging sea waves, appearing to all inhabitants of the island that turned to center, as if the sky was falling. And finishing in the space of the Creed or Our Father and Ave Maria all or more, it began again to shake <b>softly</b> <b>as</b> much.|$|E
2500|$|The longe line {{takes the}} place of the rider's rein aids. It may be held like a riding rein, with the line running to the horse held between the fourth and fifth finger, or held like a driving rein, with it running between the thumb and pointer finger. The elbow is softly bent, with the arm at an {{approximately}} 90-degree angle. The horse and handler should not pull, jerk, or [...] "hang" [...] on the line. Like rein aids while riding, signals are given smoothly and as <b>softly</b> <b>as</b> possible to get the desired response, with aids given by squeezing or turning the hand.|$|E
60|$|Pritchard laughed <b>softly</b> <b>as</b> {{he passed}} his arm through his friend's.|$|E

60|$|However gloomy her day {{might have}} been she always brightened in the evening as {{naturally}} as moths begin to flutter when candles come. On the evening of this day the friendly atmosphere about her, and the excitement of Warwick's presence so affected her, that though the gayety of girlhood was quite gone she looked <b>as</b> <b>softly</b> brilliant <b>as</b> some late flower that has gathered the summer to itself and gives it out again in the bloom and beauty of a single hour.|$|R

60|$|The transit was happily effected, {{and closely}} hidden in wool, Leonard Copeland was lifted out the boat, {{more than half}} unconscious, and {{afterwards}} transferred to the vessel, and placed in wrappings <b>as</b> <b>softly</b> and securely <b>as</b> Grisell and Clemence could arrange before King Edward's men came to exact their poundage on the freight, but happily did not concern themselves about the sick man.|$|R
