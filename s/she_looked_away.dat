2500|$|On May 11, 1908, Alice {{similarly}} amused {{herself in}} the Capitol's gallery at the House of Representatives by placing a tack on the chair of an unknown but [...] "middle-aged" [...] and [...] "dignified" [...] gentleman. Upon encountering the tack, [...] "like the burst of a bubble on the fountain, like the bolt from the blue, like the ball from the cannon," [...] the unfortunate fellow leapt up in pain and surprise while <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away,</b> {{finding his}} fascinated gaze a little embarrassing.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away,</b> and her persisting, yet ever-changing smile grew {{slightly}} arch.|$|E
6000|$|As he sat listening, {{his eyes}} grew wide {{and his lips}} were parted, like a child who feels the tale but does not {{understand}} the words. <b>She,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> from herself at last, saw him, began to laugh gently, and patted his hand saying: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> steadfastly <b>away</b> {{from him}} and tried to {{withdraw}} her arm.|$|R
5000|$|Howard, who {{had never}} done {{anything}} like that before, leaves, horrified. Howard later travels {{back to the city}} and to a bank where he sees Christine working there, and tries to speak to her, but <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>away</b> in anger. He loudly pleads with her to [...] "listen" [...] to him, but his pleas literally fall on deaf ears.|$|R
60|$|A little spot of colour {{burned in}} her cheeks. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> hastily.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> then, and {{presently}} pointed far out {{and down}} into the Basin.|$|E
60|$|Again <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> {{out of the}} window. The panes were blurred with {{streaming}} rain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Has {{it struck}} {{you that there}} was {{anything}} queer in his letters lately?" [...] <b>she</b> asked, <b>looking</b> <b>away,</b> her eyes all bright with tears.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> long <b>away</b> from {{me across}} the lagoon and at last sighed, like one who has drunk deeply, and turned to me.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Merritt, {{sitting on}} the edge of the piazza, stooped over with {{difficulty}} and plucked a glass-straw, which she bit as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> rebelliously <b>away.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> {{from him}} along {{the shaft of}} light towards the window in silence.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> from me downhill. The {{people were}} coming out of their houses, astonished.|$|E
60|$|She {{stared at}} the paper in her hand. Then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> into the fire.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy {{saw that}} she was nervous. There was tension in the air. <b>She</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> from him, out across the lake, and her face was flushed.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] <b>she</b> replied, <b>looking</b> <b>away.</b> <b>She</b> did {{not want}} to say more, but some power made her add, [...] "I am going to school there." ...|$|R
5000|$|The shoot glamorised the 2012 Delhi Gang Rape [...] "...the photos show a model {{being sexually}} {{assaulted}} by men {{sitting on a}} set resembling a bus. One image in the series called “The Wrong Turn” shows a man grabbing her shoulder while <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>away</b> in disapproval and is pushing away another man. Another picture shows the model lying down while one man fondles her leg and the other holds her down." ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> from him, {{east and}} then west, and then met his eye again.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away,</b> {{for once}} more the tears were coming to her eyes. She tried to laugh.|$|E
60|$|She {{marked the}} {{agitation}} and bewilderment of the girl's expression, and how <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> from her.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>away,</b> {{still in}} her vision, and she spoke with impatience and {{almost as if he}} hadn't {{understood}} her. [...] "YOU'LL save him. That's who'll save him." ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{eyes were}} lifted to his and Peter was {{conscious}} {{of the fact that}} she wished him to know that they were beautiful. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> slowly <b>away</b> again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could work}} here," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> at the {{standing}} corn, and the dim blue woods. He followed her look, and laughed quietly, with indulgent resignation.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> from me confusedly, as if {{she were}} ashamed to recall this part of her dream.|$|E
60|$|After all, she was {{a little}} interested. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> from the sunny gardens and into her father's face.|$|E
60|$|A moment's intense dejection {{seized upon}} her. The tears stood {{in her eyes}} as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> from him.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> hastily <b>away.</b> For {{a moment}} Brooks met her eyes, {{and his heart}} gave an unusual leap. Lady Caroom watched them both thoughtfully, {{and then turned to}} their host.|$|R
6000|$|... "You had not," [...] {{answered}} the proud Egyptian. <b>She</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> {{from him to}} show that his repentance was not even interesting to her. However, she had forgotten already not to listen.|$|R
50|$|A youth on {{the ground}} implores a maidens {{affections}} in The Invitation. The young man wears a garland as he stretches toward his companion. <b>She,</b> nude, <b>looks</b> <b>away,</b> bashfully. Behind them is a wall of rock.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> from {{me for a}} moment. My {{question}} {{seemed to}} disconcert her, perhaps by reason of its directness.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away,</b> {{and would}} not answer. There was a pitiful redness about her {{sensitive}} nostrils, and her quivering lips.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> for a moment. Her tone, {{when she}} replied, {{was meant to}} convey some slight {{annoyance}} at the question.|$|E
60|$|Pietro {{is already}} married, yet he behaves {{as if he}} were not. He has been {{carrying}} on with a loose woman, the wife of the citron-coloured barber, the Siciliano. Then he seats himself on the women's side of the theatre, behind a young person from Bogliaco, who also has no reputation, and makes her talk to him. He leans forward, resting his arms on the seat before him, stretching his slender, cat-like, flexible loins. The padrona of the hotel hates him--'ein frecher Kerl,' she says with contempt, and <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>away.</b> Her eyes hate to see him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I forgot {{you were}} driving to-day," [...] <b>she</b> replied, and <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> from him. There was a moment's pause--long, {{it seemed to}} her.|$|R
60|$|He {{handed her}} a little packet. She dropped it idly into her lap. <b>She</b> was <b>looking</b> steadfastly <b>away</b> from them.|$|R
