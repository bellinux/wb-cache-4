25|$|<b>Short</b> <b>path</b> {{distillation}} is a distillation {{technique that}} involves the distillate travelling a short distance, often only a few centimeters, and is normally done at reduced pressure. A classic example would be a distillation involving the distillate travelling from one glass bulb to another, {{without the need for}} a condenser separating the two chambers. This technique is often used for compounds which are unstable at high temperatures or to purify small amounts of compound. The advantage is that the heating temperature can be considerably lower (at reduced pressure) than the boiling point of the liquid at standard pressure, and the distillate only has to travel a short distance before condensing. A <b>short</b> <b>path</b> ensures that little compound is lost {{on the sides of the}} apparatus. The Kugelrohr is a kind of a <b>short</b> <b>path</b> distillation apparatus which often contain multiple chambers to collect distillate fractions.|$|E
25|$|In a kugelrohr a <b>short</b> <b>path</b> {{distillation}} apparatus is typically used (generally {{in combination with}} a (high) vacuum) to distill high boiling (> 300°C) compounds. The apparatus consists of an oven in which the compound to be distilled is placed, a receiving portion which is outside of the oven, and a means of rotating the sample. The vacuum is normally generated by using a high vacuum pump.|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{however, the}} {{pheromone}} trail starts to evaporate, thus reducing its attractive strength. The more {{time it takes}} for an ant to travel down the path and back again, the more time the pheromones have to evaporate. A <b>short</b> <b>path,</b> by comparison, gets marched over more frequently, and thus the pheromone density becomes higher on shorter paths than longer ones. Pheromone evaporation also has the advantage of avoiding the convergence to a locally optimal solution. If there were no evaporation at all, the paths chosen by the first ants would tend to be excessively attractive to the following ones. In that case, the exploration of the solution space would be constrained. The influence of pheromone evaporation in real ant systems is unclear, but it is very important in artificial systems.|$|E

25|$|Molecular {{distillation}} is {{vacuum distillation}} below {{the pressure of}} 0.01 torr. 0.01 torr is one order of magnitude above high vacuum, where fluids are in the free molecular flow regime, i.e. the mean free path of molecules {{is comparable to the}} size of the equipment. The gaseous phase no longer exerts significant pressure on the substance to be evaporated, and consequently, rate of evaporation no longer depends on pressure. That is, because the continuum assumptions of fluid dynamics no longer apply, mass transport is governed by molecular dynamics rather than fluid dynamics. Thus, a <b>short</b> <b>path</b> between the hot surface and the cold surface is necessary, typically by suspending a hot plate covered with a film of feed next to a cold plate with a line of sight in between. Molecular distillation is used industrially for purification of oils.|$|E

40|$|Finding <b>shortest</b> <b>paths</b> in planar domains {{bounded by}} polygons is a well-studied problem in {{computational}} geometry. However, in many applications, only finding the <b>shortest</b> <b>path</b> is not sufficient: {{we need to}} be able to generate a list of <b>short</b> <b>paths</b> among which we can choose the route. Simple detours to the <b>shortest</b> <b>path</b> are rarely better than the direct path, and therefore we should return paths that are essentially different. To ensure that, we limit our consideration to locally <b>shortest</b> <b>paths,</b> defined as the paths that cannot be made shorter by infinitesimal perturbations, or more intuitively, the paths that are 'pulled taut' around the obstacles of the domain. We use the first half of the thesis to present the definitions and the basic theory of locally <b>shortest</b> <b>paths.</b> We prove that they are always polygonal chains of certain type, and use this to describe a simple visibility graph based algorithm for finding the kth <b>shortest</b> <b>path,</b> i. e. the kth element in the list of locally <b>shortest</b> <b>paths</b> between given points ordered by length. We prove that there is a unique way to change a locally <b>shortest</b> <b>path</b> continuously by moving its endpoints while keeping the <b>path</b> locally <b>shortest.</b> This result is used to show that the set of locally <b>shortest</b> <b>paths</b> with one fixed endpoint forms a covering space of the planar domain. We use this to to prove a connection between homotopy theory and locally shortest paths: each homotopy class contains exactly one locally <b>shortest</b> <b>path,</b> and that <b>path</b> is the <b>shortest</b> <b>path</b> in its homotopy class. The covering space structure formed by locally <b>shortest</b> <b>paths</b> also gives rise to the idea of tracking the lengths of the locally <b>shortest</b> <b>paths</b> between a fixed point s and a point x, and drawing a map of the points x in which the order of lengths of the paths changes or the type of one of the locally <b>shortest</b> <b>paths</b> changes. The resulting map is the kth <b>shortest</b> <b>path</b> map, a subdivision of the domain into components such that the kth <b>shortest</b> <b>path</b> from s to any point within a single component is essentially the same.
