Sestak's victory was seen as a minor embarrassment for Obama, who strongly and publicly advocated for Specter during the race. Several news outlets reflected that Sestak's television advertisements condemning Specter as a hypocrite and opportunist were especially effective and may have been the primary factor in his victory.

N A potential longer-acting injectable providing at least 6 months of protection appeals to programmatic professionals. N Subcutaneous administration of DMPA offers major injectable improvements over the current intramuscular approach. N Ironically, while injectable use will inevitably grow, better choice and wider availability of other methods—especially of long-acting and permanent methods—will reduce injectables 9 overall share. PLUSES AND MINUSES OF INJECTABLES I njectables are a leading method in much of thedeveloping world. They have many advantages for the client, the provider, and the system (Table). All the same, the dominant injectable DMPA (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate) in its current intra-muscular (IM) form has some pretty important drawbacks—notably, side effects, higher blood levels than needed {{for most of the}} 3 -month duration, provider bias, possible role in HIV acquisition, and requirement for repeated visits that are a burden to both the system and the client.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} shows that the returns to labor and the skill premium both increase in developing countries after trade liberalization, despite the low skill content of their exports. The author explains this apparent puzzle by arguing that trade in-creases technology transfers from industrial to developing countries and that the transfer technology is biased in favor of skilled labor. The relative demand for skilled labor increases during the transition following liberalization, and so the gains en-joyed by skilled labor are temporary, {{even in the absence}} of supply responses. The gains become longer lasting when the transferred technology is also skill-biased. Several recent studies have found that trade liberalization in developing coun-tries is often associated with a large increase in the returns to labor and with an increase in wage inequality. The increase in the returns to labor <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> surprise: labor <b>should</b> receive at least some of the benefits from trade. The increased differential between the wages of skilled and unskilled labor, how-ever, is more puzzling. According to the conventional and largely substantiated view of North-South trade, the industrial "North " exports high-quality goods to the developing "South, " which exports primary products or lower-technol-ogy goods to the North. Trade liberalization in a developing economy should therefore be associated with an increase in the relative demand for unskilled labor and a narrowing of wage differentials. This article discusses a channel through which the effects of trade liberal-ization are transmitted to the labor market and explains why both labor returns and wage inequality can increase after liberalization. According to this view, developing economies (the South) advance by learning from the technology of industrial economies (the North). Learning is faster when trad...|$|R

40|$|Computer {{games have}} made a {{significant}} cultural, social, economic, political, and technological impact on society (Newman 2004). Given the widespread popularity of video games, their ability to sustain long-term player engagement with challenging tasks (Gee 2003), and their tendency to elicit proactive player comm unities (Rheingold 1994), it <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> great surprise that educators have become increasingly interested in the potential of such games as learning tools. The term game-based learning {{has emerged as a}} general name for the use of games in education. Despite early work showing rich inferential learning taking place as a result of gameplay (Greenfield 1984), most game-based learning has been geared towards using a game as a host into which curricular content can be embedded. This approach can be problematic, however, because it too often builds upon the premise that learning is not fun and that games are, and that by introducing a game element, one can make learning fun. As we will argue, the processes involved in learning and play are often very similar, and the true potential of gaming in higher education may be realized in other ways. By allowing the learning process to become informed rather than supplemented by processes identified with successful gameplay, instructors can maintain consistency and coherence without relying on extrinsic motivational interventions. The importance of consistency and coherence shall be touched upon throughout this work, but for specific discussion on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, see Malone (1982). In contrast to game-based learning, game-informed learning suggests that educational processes themselves should be informed by the experience of gameplay—a tenet similar to the principles of contemporary active learning approaches such as constructivism and problem-based learning (PBL). Recent discussion of such approaches has been offered by Boud and Miller (1996), but these methods clearly have their roots in Kolb (1984), Lewin (1948), and Dewey (1933). Indeed, the principles of successful gameplay build on these established learning practices, suggesting that game-informed learning may offer a particularly valuable—and already influential—alternative to game-based learning in higher education...|$|R
