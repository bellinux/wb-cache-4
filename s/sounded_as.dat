5|$|Aghartas 1976 North American release had {{different}} artwork designed by John Berg, the art director from Davis' U.S. label, Columbia Records. In its liner notes, an inscription said the record should be listened {{to at the}} highest possible volume, and the trumpeter was credited for the arrangements. After it was released, Macero received a complaint from Columbia's accounting department about Davis being compensated $2,500 per arrangement, arguing {{that none of the}} music <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> if it had been arranged.|$|E
5|$|The name Eboracum {{became the}} Anglian Eoforwic in the 7thcentury: a {{compound}} of Eofor-, from the old name, and -wic a village probably by conflation of the element Ebor- with a Germanic root *eburaz (boar); by the 7thcentury the Old English for 'boar' had become eofor. Alternatively, the word eofor already existed as an Old English word for wild swine, which is a cognate of the current Low Saxon word eaver and Dutch ever. The Anglo-Saxon newcomers probably interpreted the ebor part as eofor, and -rac as ric (meaning rich), while -um was (and is) a common abbreviation of the Saxon -heem, meaning home. To them, it <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> a 'home rich in boar'. As is common in Saxon place names, the -um part gradually faded; eoforic. When the Danish army conquered the city in 866, its name became Jórvík.|$|E

25|$|Folk ragtime – ragtime that {{originated}} from small towns or assembled from folk strains, {{or at least}} <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> if they did. Folk rags often have unusual chromatic features typical of composers with non-standard training.|$|E
25|$|And {{a bridge}} they {{remained}} even while singing the most startlingly chromatic of the mad prince's compositions. Through the uneven phrases of the madrigals, the music pursued its course, never {{sticking to the}} same key for two bars together. In Gesualdo, that fantastic character out of a Webster melodrama, psychological disintegration had exaggerated, had pushed to the extreme limit, a tendency inherent in modal as opposed to fully tonal music. The resulting works <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> though {{they might have been}} written by the later Schoenberg.|$|E

Track walker Eriksson arrived from his house east of the accident site. His wife had lowered the boom barrier at the railway crossing and was standing {{and waiting for the}} train when she thought it <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> if the train had stopped, so Eriksson quickly went {{to the site of the}} derailment. Once he saw that the telegraph poles were aslant, he knew that something serious had occurred. Upon seeing that the train had derailed, he hurried to Getå Halt to notify Krokek Station what had occurred.|$|E
25|$|Due to his successes, Yue {{was awarded}} the Five Star Medal and {{promoted}} to deputy commander of the 21st PS/4th PG, though {{by the fall of}} Shanghai in late November the whole unit was reduced to two operational Hawk IIIs. These were flown by Yue and his superior, Captain Tung Ming-teh, to Nanking on 3 December. Just after arriving at their new airfield, an air raid warning was <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> a large IJNAS formation approached. Yue and Tung again took off, and went on to engage the whole bomber squadron escorted by 11 A5Ms by themselves. Yue's machine was eventually hit and he bailed out, but his parachute failed to open and he fell to his death. Tung survived and confirmed Yue's death.|$|E
25|$|Many {{accounts}} {{state that}} both men fired in near perfect unison. Some stated it <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> if one shot had been fired. “One witness said {{it looked as}} if the guns were spitting fire at the same time.” Then, a number of shots followed, ranging between five and nine according to different testimonies. As reports tell of a total of five entry wounds in the two men, the minimum number of shots fired had to be five. The exchange occurred rapidly. Reid received a bullet to one leg. Reid fired two more rounds, one grazing Smith’s left arm and the other striking his left thigh above the knee and exiting the other side. Chambering his Winchester, Smith sent a bullet into Reid’s lower abdomen and groin. Reid fell face down upon the planking, severely wounded. It is not known if Smith remained standing or also had fallen.|$|E

25|$|The {{flight crew}} did not acquire any visual ground {{references}} before the approach was started. The aircraft started its final descent for landing too early. The aircraft had descended to 280 feet above ground when the terrain awareness and warning system sounded in the cockpit. The captain ordered a go-around and the autopilot was turned off. The first officer put {{the nose of}} the aircraft up for 4 seconds and the thrust levers were set to go-around power. The aircraft pitched up to 12.3° nose up and the flight crew raised the landing gear and flaps. Shortly thereafter the co-pilot started making nose down inputs which caused the aircraft to pitch-attitude to reduce to 3.5° nose down. (The co-pilot could have been focused on the aircraft's speed, rather than its altitude.) The go-around pitch attitude was not maintained and the instructions from the flight director were not followed. (The report says that fatigue could {{have played a role in}} causing the first officer to focus solely on the airspeed.) The captain and the first officer were making inputs to the aircraft's side stick at the same time (although the dual inputs were not sufficient to trigger a dual-input warning). This action appears to be intended to provide assistance by the captain to fly the aircraft. This action led to confusion on who was flying the aircraft. The ground proximity warning system <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> the aircraft lost more height and the co-pilot responded with a sharp nose-down input. Then the captain took control of the aircraft without warning, via the side stick priority button and maintained the nose-down input, while the first officer was simultaneously pulling back on his own side stick. Two seconds before impact with the ground the aircraft was at 180 feet. The captain was also pulling his side stick fully back, suggesting both pilots were aware of the aircraft's impending collision with the ground.|$|E
25|$|The {{forests of}} India {{were some of}} the richest {{resources}} in the British colonies. The value of forests was realised very early and forest management was introduced early on the sub-continent. The links between water, climate and forest cover were noted particularly early and warnings on deforestation were <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> early as 1840 by surgeons in the East India Company like Edward Balfour. This was to lead to forest conservation measures although the later policies of forest management were aimed at the production of commercial products such as teak timber. The post of a conservationist was created and this term was related to the patches of forests that they managed, called conservancies, and was not related to biodiversity conservation. Even today, vast tracts of Indian forests are covered with teak plantations, low in biodiversity and seasonally ravaged by forest fires. The first foresters in India were highly influenced by forest management in Germany and many forest officers in India were trained in the German school of thought brought into India by Dietrich Brandis (1824–1907)-the father of tropical forestry. Numerous officers including James Sykes Gamble (1847–1925), Alexander Gibson and Hugh Francis Cleghorn in the Indian Forest service added information on the flora of India. Several amateurs also worked alongside from other civil services and they were assisted by professional botanists such as Joseph Dalton Hooker (1817–1911), John Gerard Koenig (1728–1785), Robert Wight (1796–1872), Nathaniel Wallich (1786–1854) and William Roxburgh (1751–1815), the Father of Indian Botany. Another area of interest was the introduction of plants of economic importance to India. Many of these introductions were tried in botanical gardens at Sibpur, Poona, Madras and Saharanpur. The Chinese monopoly on tea was ended when tea was introduced in Darjeeling and Sri Lanka through the work of Robert Fortune (1812–1880). The botanical garden at Sibpur in Calcutta was started in 1787 by Col. Robert Kyd (1746–1793). Sir George King (1840–1904) {{who was in charge of}} the garden from 1871 was instrumental in the creation of a herbarium at the garden and founded the Botanical Survey of India in 1890. Later botanical workers include the paleobotanist Birbal Sahni (1891–1949).|$|E

[...] However, Strother did note that he personally felt that the bass guitar was buried in the mix, and that this detracted from an otherwise near-perfect album. Musick Magazines Zuza Stecka opined that the album is sure to satisfy the seven-year wait after Antestor's last release and that the skills in recording the album should not be underestimated. Stecka noted, however, that the guitar solos were not that impressive, and at times <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> though they were forced, recorded only because the band felt obligated to do so.|$|E
500|$|Nelson and {{the band}} {{encountered}} problems in producing {{some aspects of the}} song.

It was a tough choice of choosing which tempo to play, because sometimes it sounded too rushed, and sometimes it <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> if it was dragging..." [...] The band was trying to get the right tempo, according to Nelson, [...] "because a beat either side of the tempo we picked didn't have the same groove". To improve the song, they recorded this part live and Buckland overdubbed his guitar. They recorded it two or three times until Nelson {{and the band}} were happy at the output. The backing vocals were recorded in the control room of Quadrangle.|$|E

Neil Hannon of the Irish band The Divine Comedy expressed admiration for [...] "Black Coffee", commending its production-heavy sound which [...] "adds to the sound of it, rather than taking anything away", and noted that its sound later became apparent in singles by Girls Aloud: [...] "Girls Aloud do pop like that now: songs like 'Biology' are a bit weird, and they flout the general rules, and I admire that. But 'Black Coffee' is better." [...] Writing for Metro in 2013, Seamus Duff stated that [...] "Black Coffee" [...] still <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> [...] "fresh and relevant".|$|E
