[...] In response to criticism about his remarks Belafonte asked, [...] "What do you call Bush when the war he put us in to date has killed almost as many Americans as died on 9/11 and the number of Americans wounded in war is almost triple? [...] By most definitions Bush can be considered a terrorist." [...] When he was asked about his expectation of criticism for his remarks on the war in Iraq, Belafonte responded: [...] "Bring it on.
