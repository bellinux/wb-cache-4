5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will <b>still</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E

Hayley tries to get the door shut But it's too strong to close off. Klaus now having the home being flooded Can go {{whenever}} he wants and says see you never with the F-word being bombed. He jumps out of the fishbowl into the water only to have his skin to burn due to salt water before hayley puts him back in the fishbowl. The other family makes an rope out of curtins {{to get them out of}} the attic after removing stuff out of the door. Roger (now missing his wigs until it's here) Picks up the wigs instead klaus that he <b>still</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> cowboy weddings, leaving him behind. Franice tell the family to take one at the time as the rope is too weak. Unfortunately, Jeff was too panicked to wait. He jumps on the rope witch ends up tearing it down, angering hayley.|$|E
25|$|During their careers, masked luchadores {{will often}} {{be seen in}} public wearing their masks and keeping up the culture of Lucha Libre, while other masked wrestlers will {{interact}} with the public and press normally. However, they will <b>still</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> great lengths to conceal their true identities; in effect, the mask is synonymous with the luchador. El Santo continued wearing his mask after retirement, revealed his face briefly only in old age, and was buried wearing his silver mask.|$|E

25|$|In 1852, Horacio Morales {{helped build}} the first chapel in San Juan, {{although}} many parishioners <b>still</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Santa Bárbara. By 1885, the district educated as many boys as girls, with schools for both.|$|R
25|$|There, {{a fabulous}} welcome awaited them. On the ramparts above the wreck strewn harbour, on the Barracca, St Angelo and Senglea, great crowds of Maltese {{men and women}} waved and cheered and a brass band {{on the end of}} the mole was giving a {{spirited}} rendition of Rule Britannia. Captain Mason, however, standing at the salute on the battered bridge of Ohio, could spare not a moment's thought for the pride of bringing the ship to harbour, since the creaking plates showed that Ohio might <b>still</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the bottom of the Grand Harbour.|$|E
500|$|Poland under Gomułka's {{rule was}} {{generally}} described {{as one of}} the more [...] "liberal" [...] communist regimes. However, Poles could <b>still</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> prison for writing political satire about the party leader, as Janusz Szpotański did, or for publishing a book abroad. A March 1964 [...] "Letter of the 34", signed by leading intellectuals and delivered to the office of Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz, criticized the worsening censorship and demanded a more open cultural policy, as guaranteed by the Constitution. Jacek Kuroń and Karol Modzelewski were expelled from the party and from 1965 imprisoned for written criticism (the Open Letter to the Party) of the party rule and pointing out the contradictory nature of the supposedly workers' state. Kuroń and Modzelewski accused the regime of betraying the revolutionary cause; like many younger Polish reformers, they spoke from leftist positions and were ideologically closely aligned with Western radicals of the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Gosnell, {{his wife}} Pearl, and eight other clinic {{employees}} were {{charged in the}} case. Eight, including Gosnell's wife, subsequently pleaded guilty, most of whom would testify against Gosnell, and three of these pleaded guilty to third-degree murder, carrying a 20- to 40-year term. [...] A gag order was imposed on both defense and prosecution in April 2011, to bar them from talking to the media before the trial. In December 2011 Pearl Gosnell pleaded guilty to performing illegal abortions, conspiracy, criminal conspiracy and corrupt organization; due to spousal privilege, {{she would not have}} to testify against Gosnell, although she could <b>still</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> prison. She had testified to the grand jury that she alone assisted on Sundays, and that her role was to “help do the instruments” in the procedure room and to monitor patients in the recovery room. Another employee testified that she assisted with late-term abortions “on Sundays or days we were closed [...] do special cases.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Education in Northern Ireland {{is heavily}} segregated. Most state schools in Northern Ireland are {{predominantly}} Protestant, {{while the majority}} of Catholic children attend schools maintained by the Catholic Church. In all, 90 per cent of children in Northern Ireland <b>still</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> separate faith schools. The consequence is, as one commentator has put it, that [...] "the overwhelming majority of Ulster's children can go from four to 18 without having a serious conversation with a member of a rival creed." [...] The prevalence of segregated education has been cited as a major factor in maintaining endogamy (marriage within one's own group). The integrated education movement has sought to reverse this trend by establishing non-denominational schools such as the Portadown Integrated Primary. Such schools are, however, still the exception to the general trend of segregated education. Integrated schools in Northern Ireland have been established through the voluntary efforts of parents. The churches have not been involved in the development of integrated education. However, both the Catholic Church and Protestant denominations, along with state-run institutions, have supported and organized cross-community school projects such as joint field trips, educational classes and forums wherein pupils can come together to share their beliefs, values and cultures.|$|E
2500|$|Introduced {{with the}} Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V anime series. Pendulum Monsters are {{variations}} of the above monster types, represented by a green gradient over each type's respective color (for example, Effect Pendulum Monsters are orange/green while Xyz Pendulum Monsters are black/green). They are stored and summoned {{in the same manner}} as their original counterparts, but are sent to the Extra Deck face-up when they would be sent from the field to the Graveyard (monsters sent from the Hand or Deck will <b>still</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Graveyard). During the Main Phase, players can place any Pendulum Monsters in their hand into any open Pendulum Zones, where they become treated as spell cards and can utilise a Pendulum Effect listed separately from any Monster Effects (some Pendulum cards may not necessarily possess a Pendulum Effect). Pendulum Monsters possess indicators known as [...] "Scales", which are used to perform a Pendulum Summon. Once during a player's turn, if there are Pendulum Monsters with different Scales in both Pendulum Zones, the player may Special Summon multiple monsters from their hand, as well as any Pendulum Monsters face-up in the Extra Deck, whose levels are in between the two different Scale values. Pendulum Monsters that are stored in the Extra Deck face down must first be summoned using their respective summoning methods and can only be Pendulum Summoned when they are face-up in the Extra Deck (for example, an [...] "Xyz Pendulum" [...] Monster must first be Xyz Summoned before it can be Pendulum Summoned).|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{sounds very}} wise," [...] Monsieur Duchesne {{said with a}} smile, [...] "but {{when the time comes}} for the choice I fancy that most men do not accept either alternative, but marry and <b>still</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sea." ...|$|E
50|$|Philip made {{reforms in}} government, and {{strengthened}} the central authorities {{relative to the}} provinces.

50|$|The ancient Kaviyoor Graamam {{comprised}} five deshams, viz, Padinjattumcherry, Anjilithanam, Kunnanthanam, Iraviperoor and Murani (Mallappally West). Parts of Muthoor East also fell within Kaviyoor. The temple procession (Ooruvalathth, ഊരുവലത്ത്) <b>still</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> {{these areas}} - except to Mallappally west (Murani) which is done only symbolically.|$|R
50|$|Tim and Sally later get engaged however {{she kisses}} Kevin and he finds out. Sally, presumably having a {{breakdown}} of some sort <b>still</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> the wedding and Tim eventually turns up after Kevin talked him round. They then married happily in front of guests.|$|R
6000|$|... "These little {{informal}} Sunday suppers and free-for-alls {{are increasing}} in number, {{and they are}} signs of civilization. Of course {{a few of the}} women <b>still</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> church in the morning, but that will wear off, except at new-bonnet time." ...|$|E

6000|$|Valencia went, utterly bewildered. She had {{forgotten}} Frank, but Frank had not forgotten her. He had hurried to his room; lay till morning, sleepless with delight, and pouring out his pure spirit in thanks for this great and unexpected blessing. A new life had begun for him, {{even in the}} jaws of death. He would <b>still</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the East. It seemed easy to him to go there {{in search of a}} grave; how much more now, when he felt so full of magic life, that fever, cholera, the chances of war, could not harm him! After this proof of God's love, how could he doubt, how fear? ...|$|E
50|$|Fassbender {{has lived}} in Hackney, London, since 1996 in the same flat that he has owned since {{he was in his}} late 20s. He is fluent in German and has {{expressed}} interest in performing in a German-language film or play. He is a lapsed Catholic, though he <b>still</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> church to light candles.|$|R
50|$|Five of {{the first}} round matches {{required}} extra time to break the deadlock; two games <b>still</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> a replay. In one replay, Cuba advanced to the next round at the expense of Romania 2-1. Sweden advanced directly to the quarter-finals as a result of Austria's withdrawal, and they proceeded to beat Cuba 8-0.|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of Pirriwee Public's Trivia Night, Josh tells Celeste that it is Max, not Ziggy, who is {{bullying}} the other children. She realizes that Max is mimicking Perry and finally decides to leave him.

6000|$|... "He {{is a cold}} man," [...] said he to himself, as {{one name}} did occur to him, [...] "very cold, almost unfeeling; but he is honest and just." [...] And then again he sat and thought. [...] "Yes, he is honest and just; and what should I want better than honesty and justice?" [...] And then, shuddering as he resolved, he did resolve that he would send for this honest and just man. He would send for him; or, perhaps better <b>still,</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> him. At any rate, he would tell him the whole truth of his grief, and then act as the cold, just man should bid him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{quite as}} bad as that," [...] Master Swindon replied. [...] "There are the rules which they have to obey when at home, and if not they get a whipping; but it is {{difficult}} to keep a hand over them when they are abroad. After the shops are closed and the supper over they have from time immemorial the right to go out for two hours' exercise. They are supposed to go and shoot at the butts; but archery, I grieve to say, is falling into disrepute, and although many <b>still</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the butts the practice is no longer universal. But here is supper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have come}} to the wrong house, Tuan Maroola, if you want to trade as you say. I was a trader once, not now, {{whatever}} you may have heard about me in Macassar. And if you want anything, you will not find it here; I have nothing to give, and want nothing myself. You should go to the Rajah here; you can see in the daytime his houses across the river, there, where those fires are burning on the shore. He will help you and trade with you. Or, better <b>still,</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Arabs over there," [...] he went on bitterly, pointing with his hand towards the houses of Sambir. [...] "Abdulla is the man you want. There is nothing he would not buy, and there is nothing he would not sell; believe me, I know him well." ...|$|E

50|$|Spain {{was a major}} {{producer}} of tungsten, a crucial material to Germanys war effort. The United States had launched a program at great expense to buy the entirety of Spains tungsten production, but some <b>still</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the Germans. The United States used the incident {{to put pressure on}} Spain to stop all exports of tungsten.|$|R
6000|$|If the {{children}} of the decent skilled artisan and middle-class suffer less obviously than the poorer sort of children, assuredly the parents in wearing anxiety, in toil and limitation and disappointment, suffer more. And in less intense and dramatic, but perhaps even more melancholy ways, {{the children}} of this class do suffer. They do not die so abundantly in infancy, but they grow up, too many of them, to shabby and limited lives; in Britain they are still, as a class, extraordinarily ill educated--many of them <b>still</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> incompetent, understaffed and ill-equipped private adventure schools--they are sent into business prematurely, often at fourteen or fifteen, they become mechanical [...] "respectable" [...] drudges in processes they do not understand. They may escape want and squalor for a while, perhaps, but they cannot escape narrowness and limitation and a cramped and anxious life. If they get to anything better than that, it is chiefly through almost heroic parental effort and sacrifice.|$|E
6000|$|On the {{following}} morning, after an early breakfast, Lady Anna went to Great Russell Street, {{and there she}} remained {{the greater part of}} the day. The people of the house understood that the couple were to be married as soon as their lodger should be well, and had heard much of the magnificence of the marriage. They were kind and good, and the tailor declared very often that this was the happiest period of his existence. Of all the good turns ever done to him, he said, the wound in his back had been the best. As his sweetheart sat by his bedside they planned their future life. They would <b>still</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the distant land on which his heart was set, though it might be only for awhile; and she, with playfulness, declared that she would go there as Mrs. Thwaite. [...] "I suppose they can't prevent me calling myself Mrs. Thwaite, if I please." ...|$|E
60|$|Bill {{went away}} with the Spaniards, and, in place of {{improving}} the occasion by looking for liquor, as he might, perhaps, {{have been expected to}} do, went on with his task. The English sailorman does not always express himself delicately, but he is, now, at least, very far from being the dissolute, unintelligent ruffian he is sometimes supposed to be. There is no doubt of this, for shipowners know their business, and while there is no lack of Teutons and cheerful, sober Scandinavians, a certain proportion of English seamen <b>still</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sea in English ships. The man who sat in Jefferson's room could, at least, understand the treatise in the medicine chest, although it was one approved by the Board of Trade, which august body has apparently no great fondness for lucid explanations. He was, however, still pouring over it when his comrade thrust his head into the doorway again, and it is possible that Jefferson had not suffered greatly from {{the fact that he had}} not as yet quite decided on any course of treatment.|$|E

50|$|For {{those who}} <b>still</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Cleethorpes the {{miniature}} railway turned {{from a high}} spot to one of many things to being seen as pretty ordinary. Cleethorpes Borough Council (CBC) made significant investment in the line, seeking to augment purely pleasure riding with public transport functions, such as transporting people {{to and from the}} Zoo. This was doomed when the Zoo itself failed.|$|R
50|$|Forever letting Mavis down, Derek {{was usually}} {{too proud to}} admit he was at fault but <b>still</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> her with his problems. His biggest mistake was marrying his boss's daughter, Angela Hawthorne in 1985, {{even though it was}} Mavis he really wanted. After divorcing Angela, Derek finally married Mavis in 1988 and in 1990 they moved into 4 Coronation Street.|$|R
