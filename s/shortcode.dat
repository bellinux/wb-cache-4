The range of codes may be expanded in time to use other leading digits such as 4. Adult related mobile services must use codes starting with 69 or 89. Mobile operators sometimes use proprietary codes (either with a different leading digit or shorter in length for their own use). SMS short codes are often owned by holding companies who then lease them out to service providers and advertisers to promote SMS services, charitable fundraising and marketing promotions such as news alerts, voting and quizzes. Shortcodes {{can also be used}} to deliver additional content or a mobile URL link that when prompted opens the mobile web browser linking the user to a mobile web page. Premium SMS services use codes that can be set to deliver a charge to a participant’s mobile phone (in accordance with the service provider’s terms of service). Other codes (typically used by advertisers) can be free to receive “your standard rate applies” or free to send and receive. UK Premium rated SMS services are regulated by PhonepayPlus.

50|$|SMS gateway {{providers}} {{facilitate the}} SMS traffic between businesses and mobile subscribers, being mainly responsible for carrying mission-critical messages, SMS for enterprises, content delivery and entertainment services involving SMS, e.g., TV voting. Considering SMS messaging performance and cost, {{as well as}} the level of text messaging services, SMS gateway providers can be classified as resellers of the text messaging capability of another provider's SMSC or offering the text messaging capability as an operator of their own SMSC with SS7. SMS messaging gateway providers can provide gateway-to-mobile (Mobile Terminated-MT) services. Some suppliers can also supply mobile-to-gateway (text-in or Mobile Originated/MO services). Many operate text-in services on <b>shortcodes</b> or mobile number ranges, whereas others use lower-cost geographic text-in numbers.|$|R
50|$|Treasuremytext founders {{developed}} the service {{based on their}} desire to keep their SMS messages. At this time (2003) it was generally only possible to keep 15 messages on standard mobile phones, and this meant that mobile phone users often had to delete their SMS messages {{to make room for}} new ones.The service initially operated using a mobile <b>shortcode</b> available in the UK charging users 25p to save a message at the service.

50|$|In many {{countries}} however, {{the influence of}} mobile telecom operators through 8294 premium short code or alikes, which direct millions of mobile calls to the TAXI companies contracted (as 8.2.9.4 <b>shortcode</b> means T.A.X.I on any mobile phone worldwide), do influence the business trends when hailing for a TAXI, already impacted initially {{by the emergence of}} large radio dispatching private or virtual networks. Also independent taxi owners, as well as TAXI companies started in response to advertise long vanity phone numbers including 8294 number as vanity code for TAXI, for customer easy remembering of their commercial line when in need for a TAXI.Because of the overwhelming possession and use of mobile phone, the battle has moved to smartphone related marketing and mobile services CRM for taxi, through mobile universal directories of TAXI details, available worldwide on any mobile phone downtown or at the airport, as mobile directories such as www.8294.tel alternatively to yellow pages paper book edition, and also in competition with the launch of multiple mobile apps offering location services, taxis fare calculation, as well as direct call to TAXIs contracted by app editor.The ongoing trend of mobile usage is reshaping progressively the taxi business initially born as a nearly fixed infrastructure business regulated and ruled by City Halls.|$|E
50|$|Combination {{services}} {{include those}} that integrate SMS with voice, such as voice SMS. Providers include Bubble Motion, Jott, Kirusa, and SpinVox. Several operators have launched services that combine SMS with mobile instant messaging (MIM) and presence. Text-to-landline services also exist, where subscribers can {{send text messages}} to any landline phone and are charged at standard rates. The text messages are converted into spoken language. This service has been popular in America, where fixed and mobile numbers are similar. Inbound SMS has been converging to enable reception of different formats (SMS, voice, MMS, etc.). UK companies, including consumer goods companies and media giants, should {{soon be able to}} let consumers contact them via voice, SMS, MMS, IVR, or video using one five-digit number or long number. In April 2008, O2 UK launched voice-enabled <b>shortcodes,</b> adding voice functionality to the five-digit codes already used for SMS. This type of convergence is helpful for media companies, broadcasters, enterprises, call centres and help desks who need to develop a consistent contact strategy with the consumer. Because SMS is very popular today, it became relevant to include text messaging as a contact possibility for consumers. To avoid having multiple numbers (one for voice calls, another one for SMS), a simple way is to merge the reception of both formats under one number. This means that a consumer can text or call one number and be sure that the message will be received.|$|R

40|$|Shorten URL {{service is}} {{the method of}} using short URL instead of long URL, it {{redirect}} short url to long URL. While the users of microblog increased rapidly, as the creating and usage of shorten URL is convenient, shorten url became common under the limited length of writing on microblog. E-mail, SMS and books use shorten URL well, because of its simplicity. But, there is no relativeness between the most of shorten URLs and their target URLs, user can not expect the target URL. To cover this problem, there is attempts such as changing the shorten URL service name, inserting the information of website into shorten URL, and the usage of <b>shortcode</b> of physical address. However, each ones has the limits, so these are the trouble of automation, relatively long address, and the narrowness of applicable targets. SHRT is complementary to the attempts, as getting the idea from the writing system of Arabic. Though the writing system of Arabic has no vowel alphabet, Arabs have no difficult to understand their writing. This paper proposes SHRT, new method of URL Shortening. SHRT makes user guess the target URL using Relative word of the lowest domain of target URL without vowels...|$|E
40|$|Background: Prenatal {{smoking is}} a major public health concern and uptake of NHS {{cessation}} support is low in this group. Text message-based self-help is a promising intervention for this population but {{little is known about}} its likely real-world uptake, an essential parameter for estimating public health impact. Aims were to explore uptake (including cost) of a tailored, theory-guided, text message intervention for pregnant smokers (‘MiQuit’) when offered online. Methods: Links to a website providing MiQuit activation information (texting a <b>shortcode)</b> were advertised online on a cost-per-click basis for two commercial websites (Google AdWords, Facebook Ads) and free of charge for two smoking in pregnancy webpages (National Childbirth Trust, NHS Choices). Activations per advert click, per advert exposure and cost per activation were calculated. Findings: Low-visibility links on free-of-charge webpages generated few activations. For the commercial websites, cost per click was lower with Facebook but a higher proportion of Google advert clickers activated support (5. 2 % of 812 Google, 2. 2 % of 1889 Facebook), making their cost per activation very similar (£ 23. 86 Google, £ 23. 81 Facebook). Compared to participants of a prior MiQuit trial, those activating support online appeared more motivated (intended to quit smoking sooner) and those activating support via Google were earlier in pregnancy, with a sharp peak at 4 - 5 weeks gestation. Incremental costs per quitter were £ 746. 19 (95 % CI -£ 1, 886. 654 to £ 4, 595. 08) at the end of pregnancy and -£ 76. 22 (-£ 2, 790. 33 to £ 3, 844. 02) when extended to mother’s lifetime. Discussion: Online advertisements are a feasible, potentially cost-saving method for engaging pregnant smokers in cessation support...|$|E
