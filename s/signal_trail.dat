50|$|Almásy's {{greatest}} achievement {{during his}} wartime stay in North Africa was the {{successful completion of}} Operation Salam, the infiltration of two German spies through the Libyan Desert behind enemy lines {{in a manner similar}} to the Allied Long Range Desert Group. Operation Salam was not a covert operation; Almásy and his team were wearing German uniforms. They used captured British (Canadian-built) Ford cars and trucks with German crosses surreptitiously incorporated into the vehicles' camouflage pattern. Almásy successfully delivered the two Abwehr agents, Johannes Eppler and his radio operator Hans-Gerd Sandstede, into Assiut in Egypt after crossing the Gilf Kebir and Kharga Oasis. Unknown to Almásy and the German Command, British code breakers at Bletchley Park had succeeded in breaking the Abwehr hand cypher that Almásy and the spies used for their wireless transmissions. A young intelligence analyst at Bletchley Park, Jean Alington (later Jean Howard), noticed the <b>signal</b> <b>trail.</b> However, as a warning to the British HQ ME in Cairo arrived too late (due to the imminent attack of Rommel), Afrika Korps messages had a higher priority in deciphering and analysis, and Almásy was able to return to his starting point at Gialo unhindered. The subsequent Operation Condor, the actual spy mission of Eppler and Stanstede, was a complete failure. They were both captured within six weeks of reaching Cairo.|$|E
40|$|Aggregation of necrophagous larvae {{has several}} benefits: {{the sharing of}} salivary enzymes (exodigestion), {{temperature}} regulation, protection from predators and parasites, etc. and is well developed in blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae). The present study focuses on the aggregation mechanism used by the necrophagous larvae of Lucilia sericata Meigen, the common green bottle fly. The ability of single larva to detect and follow a <b>signal</b> (<b>trail)</b> created by conspecifics is investigated initially. A circular ring is drawn in a Petri dish where 20 starved larvae have crawled {{for a period of}} 30 min. A naïve (test) larva is then placed in the dish and video-tracked. Naïve larvae are able to detect the boundaries of the larvae-crawled area and stay preferentially within this conspecific-marked zone. In a second step, the orientation of larvae by scanning, a dedicated, ground-signal detection behaviour of dipteran larvae, is analyzed. Four experimental conditions are tested: control, presence of food, conspecifics, and food+conspecifics. When conspecifics have been previously present in a given area, the scanning behaviour by naïve larvae in this area decreases (both in number and frequency of scans). Accordingly, scanning by necrophagous larvae of L. sericata should be considered not only as locomotion behaviour, but also as a potential way to detect signals from conspecifics for the purpose of aggregation. The chemical composition of the attractant(s), the behavioural effects (attraction or retention) and the implication of larval signalling in the aggregation process are new fields to explore.

40|$|Activation {{of death}} receptors by their cognate ligands can induce {{apoptosis}} through {{the formation of}} death receptor <b>signalling</b> complexes. <b>TRAIL</b> has been demonstrated to selectively induce apoptosis in transformed cells, but not normal cells, by binding to its death receptors, TRAIL-R 1 and TRAIL-R 2 and inducing DISC formation. However, the use of TRAIL as a cancer therapeutic has been hampered by widespread intrinsic and acquired resistant to TRAIL in tumours. Gaining {{a better understanding of}} the mechanisms which regulate <b>TRAIL</b> <b>signalling</b> in both tumour and normal cells, will enable new strategies to overcome tumour resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to identify and characterise novel mechanisms which regulate <b>TRAIL</b> <b>signalling</b> using protein complex isolation, mass spectrometry and functional assays. By isolating the TRAIL DISC and unstimulated TRAIL-R 1 /R 2 using wild-type TRAIL and TRAIL-R 1 or -R 2 specific TRAIL mutants, novel protein interactors were identified. Oxysterol binding protein related protein 8 (ORP 8) was shown to specifically interact with unstimulated TRAIL-R 1 /R 2 and regulate the cell surface expression of TRAIL-R 2. An SCF complex, composed of S-phase kinase associated protein 1 (Skp 1), cullin- 1 (CUL 1) and F-box only protein 11 (FBXO 11), was shown to interact with unstimulated TRAIL-R 1 /R 2. The role of this complex was hypothesised to regulate ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of TRAIL-R 1 /R 2. The serine/threonine phosphatase, PP 2 A was demonstrated to interact with both the TRAIL DISC and unstimulated TRAILR 1 /R 2. PP 2 A is likely to regulate <b>TRAIL</b> <b>signalling</b> by de-phosphorylating TRAIL-R 1 /R 2 or associated proteins. In addition, the mechanism by which activated PKC inhibits TRAILinduced apoptosis was further investigated. Activation of PKC induced the phosphorylation of the intracellular domain (ICD) of TRAIL-R 2. This phosphorylation, most likely on the TRAIL-R 2 -T 298 residue, prevents aggregation of TRAIL-R 2 into a high molecular weight (HMW) -TRAIL DISC. Inhibition of HMW-DISC formation prevents FADD recruitment, caspase- 8 recruitment and activation, and blocks the induction of both the apoptotic and non-apoptotic arms of <b>TRAIL</b> <b>signalling...</b>|$|R

40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) -related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is {{a member}} of the TNF superfamily. TRAIL is promising for anticancer therapy because it induces apoptosis in cancer cells with little or no toxicity to normal cells; hence, TRAIL-receptor agonists are currently undergoing clinical trials for cancer treatment. However, many molecular <b>signaling</b> mechanisms in <b>TRAIL</b> <b>signaling</b> are not completely characterized. The functions of adaptor proteins, including TNF-receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD) and receptor-interacting protein- 1 (RIP 1) in <b>TRAIL</b> <b>signaling</b> have been controversial. We demonstrate that while wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are completely resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, MEFs derived from Tradd−/− mice are hypersensitive to TRAIL (IC 50 ∼ 0. 5 nM rmTRAIL, 24 h), an effect also seen in primary keratinocytes treated with TRAIL/CHX. Restoration of TRADD in Tradd−/− MEFs restores TRAIL resistance, indicating that TRADD plays a survival role in <b>TRAIL</b> <b>signaling.</b> We show that TRADD is recruited to the TRAIL-receptor complex, and RIP 1 recruitment is mediated by TRADD. While early activation of the MAP kinase ERK is deficient in Tradd−/− cells, the main mechanism for enhanced TRAIL sensitivity is likely due to increased recruitment of FADD to the receptor complex, indicating that TRADD may limit FADD binding within the receptor complex and also mediate RIP 1 -dependent nonapoptotic signaling events, thus reducing caspase activation and subsequent apoptosis. These novel findings have potential implications for cancer therapy using TRAIL-receptor agonists. —Cao, X., Pobezinskaya, Y. L., Morgan, M. J., Liu, Z.

(1) The time recording structures of the TDC {{is based on the}} 'wave union TDC' we developed in our previous work. A leading edge of the input hit launches a bit pattern, or wave union into the delay chain-register array structure which yields two usable measurements. The two measurements effectively sub-divide timing bins for each other especially the 'ultra-wide bins' caused by the FPGA logic array block (LAB) structure and improves measurement precision both in terms of maximum bin width and RMS resolution. A coarser measurement on input <b>signal</b> <b>trailing</b> edge is also provided for time-over-threshold (TOT) applications. (2) The TDC supports advanced timing reference distribution schemes that are superior to conventional common start/stop schemes. The TDC has 16 regular measurement channels plus two channels for timing reference. The timing reference is established with multiple measurements rather than single shot common start/stop. An advanced scheme, the mean-timing approach even eliminates needs of high quality timing distribution media. (3) The ASIC-like encapsulation of the FPGA TDC significantly shorten the learning curve for potential users while maintain certain flexibility for various applications.

One suggestion has been that this subjective impression is due to humans not being able to distinguish between focussed and blurred moving objects.

We {{demonstrate}} here that N-linked glycosylation (N-glyc) plays {{also an important}} regulatory role for TRAIL-R 1 -mediated and mouse TRAIL receptor (mTRAIL-R) -mediated apoptosis, but not for TRAIL-R 2, which is devoid of N-glycans. Cells expressing N-glyc-defective mutants of TRAIL-R 1 and mouse TRAIL-R were less sensitive to TRAIL than their wild-type counterparts. Defective apoptotic <b>signaling</b> by N-glyc-deficient <b>TRAIL</b> receptors was associated with lower TRAIL receptor aggregation and reduced DISC formation, but not with reduced TRAIL-binding affinity. Our results also indicate that TRAIL receptor N-glyc impacts immune evasion strategies. The cytomegalovirus (CMV) UL 141 protein, which restricts cell-surface expression of human TRAIL death receptors, binds with significant higher affinity TRAIL-R 1 lacking N-glyc, suggesting that this sugar modification may have evolved as a counterstrategy to prevent receptor inhibition by UL 141.

40|$|Mate-finding {{behaviour}} in {{the marine}} copepod Centropages typicus was investigated by 3 -dimensional video analysis. Females leave a chemical trail in their wake and a male intercepting a fresh trail initiates a characteristic tracking behaviour in which he increases his speed from ~ 10 to ~ 30 mm s– 1 and races up the female trail while displaying a tight zigzag motion. Within seconds the male overtakes the female and attempts to catch her. Males faithfully follow even very convoluted trails and successfully track down females after pursuing trails up to 31 s old and 17 cm long. The probability of detecting a trail is inversely related to trail age and length. Males often start tracking female trails {{in the wrong direction}} before correcting themselves, and the frequency of directional errors increases with increasing trail age. Complicated or disrupted <b>signal</b> <b>trails</b> may cause males to lose the trail. This induces a distinct signal-scanning behaviour characterised by further enhanced swimming speeds of 50 to 70 mm s– 1, and frequent shifts of direction. The male scans a restricted volume around the point where the trail was lost and often regains the trail and resumes normal tracking behaviour. This behaviour may help males follow trails that are broken by turbulence. A simple generic model of pheromone trails that is consistent with the tracking behaviour of males in C. typicus and other species of copepods was used to explore the characteristics of pheromone trails. Model considerations suggest that these pheromones are small molecules, e. g. amino acids, and that the investment in pheromone production, both in terms of elements and metabolic energy, represents {{only a small fraction of}} the females’ ingestion and metabolic rate...|$|R

40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) can induce extrinsic apoptosis, {{resulting in}} caspase- 8 activation, {{but may also}} initiate transcription-dependent prosurvival signaling. Proteasome inhibitors were suggested to promote <b>TRAIL</b> <b>signal</b> transduction through the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) by modulating the relative abundance of core DISC components, thereby enhancing caspase- 8 activation and apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the changes in DISC protein levels as an early consequence of proteasome inhibition in HeLa cervical cancer cells and, based on these data, mathematically modeled the proapoptotic <b>TRAIL</b> <b>signaling</b> toward caspase- 8 activation. Modeling results surprisingly suggested that caspase- 8 activation might be delayed in presence of proteasome inhibitors, in particular at submaximal TRAIL doses. Subsequent FRET-based single cell time-lapse imaging at conditions where transcription dependent prosurvival signaling was blocked confirmed this hypothesis: caspase- 8 activity was delayed by hours {{in the presence of}} proteasome inhibitors epoxomicin or bortezomib. Corresponding delays were detected for effector caspase processing and cell death.

40|$|Type- 2 {{diabetes}} and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are commonly associated, and greatly increase mortality risk. Insulin resistance and inflammation underlie these clinical conditions. Tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a molecule implicated {{to play a}} protective role in CVD and diabetes. Given its complex <b>signalling,</b> <b>TRAIL’s</b> physiological and pathological roles are not fully elucidated. This thesis investigated the relationship between basal TRAIL gene deficiency alone and high fat diet (HFD) -induced insulin resistance, and the link between TRAIL, inflammation and insulin resistance in blood vessels, using wildtype and TRAIL knock-out mice. The role of TRAIL in diabetes-associated atherosclerosis was investigated by assessing the effects of supraphysiological concentrations of insulin and glucose on TRAIL transcriptional regulation, gene expression and cell proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), the main cellular component of the vessel wall. VSMC proliferation is a key process in atherogenesis, yet it promotes plaque stability in advanced atherosclerosis. This thesis demonstrates that: i) 	circulating TRAIL levels are reduced {{in response to a}} HFD in wildtype mice, yet vascular TRAIL expression is upregulated, ii) 	TRAIL deficiency promotes whole-body, skeletal muscle and vascular insulin resistance, which are exacerbated by a HFD, iii) 	vascular protective effect of TRAIL in the setting of HFD-induced diabetes is associated with TRAIL’s anti-inflammatory activity, iv) 	both acute hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia positively regulate specificity protein 1 (Sp 1) -mediated TRAIL transcription and gene expression in VSMC, with only insulin having the ability to promote VSMC proliferation in a TRAIL-dependent manner, and v) 	hyperinsulinemia-inducible TRAIL gene expression is time-dependent; chronic treatment downregulates TRAIL gene expression in VSMC. This thesis provides novel insights into the role of TRAIL in modulating insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and VSMC phenotype.

PRMT 5 selectively interacted with death receptor 4 and death receptor 5 but not with TNF receptor 1 or Fas. PRMT 5 gene silencing sensitized various cancer cells to TRAIL without affecting TRAIL resistance in nontransformed cells. PRMT 5 contributed to TRAIL-induced activation of inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), leading to induction of several NF-κB target genes.

As shown here in four CTCL cell lines, loss of cell viability correlated with significant time- and dose-dependent induction of apoptosis, whereas cytotoxicity was less pronounced. Both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways were activated, as seen by processing of initiator caspases 8 and 9, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and cytochrome c release. Characteristically, antiapoptotic mediators such as Mcl- 1, XIAP, survivin, and c-FLIP were downregulated.
