50|$|A {{distinction}} can be {{made between}} scheduled and unscheduled downtime. Typically, <b>scheduled</b> <b>downtime</b> {{is a result of}} maintenance that is disruptive to system operation and usually cannot be avoided with a currently installed system design. <b>Scheduled</b> <b>downtime</b> events might include patches to system software that require a reboot or system configuration changes that only take effect upon a reboot. In general, <b>scheduled</b> <b>downtime</b> is usually the result of some logical, management-initiated event. Unscheduled downtime events typically arise from some physical event, such as a hardware or software failure or environmental anomaly. Examples of unscheduled downtime events include power outages, failed CPU or RAM components (or possibly other failed hardware components), an over-temperature related shutdown, logically or physically severed network connections, security breaches, or various application, middleware, and operating system failures.|$|E

30|$|Migrating large {{relational}} databases {{from physical}} infrastructure into the cloud presents many significant challenges, e.g., managing system downtime, choosing suitable cloud instances, and choosing a cloud provider. The database could be deployed on a database-as-a-service offered {{by one of}} several public cloud providers, or installed and configured on a virtual machine(s). With either option, selecting the appropriate cloud resources requires knowledge of the database workload and size. The infrastructure of the source database may impact the migration duration; if it has limited available capacity or bandwidth, then it will take longer to extract the data.

50|$|The {{availability}} of a website {{is measured by the}} percentage of a year in which the website is publicly accessible and reachable via the Internet. This is different from measuring the uptime of a system. Uptime refers to the system itself being online. Uptime {{does not take into account}} being able to reach it as in the event of a network outage. A hosting provider’s Service Level Agreement (SLA) may include a certain amount of <b>scheduled</b> <b>downtime</b> per year in order to perform maintenance on the systems. This <b>scheduled</b> <b>downtime</b> is often excluded from the SLA timeframe, and needs to be subtracted from the Total Time when availability is calculated. Depending on the wording of an SLA, if the {{availability of}} a system drops below that in the signed SLA, a hosting provider often will provide a partial refund for time lost. How downtime is determined changes from provider to provider, therefore reading the SLA is imperative. Not all providers release uptime statistics. Most hosting providers will guarantee at least 99.9% uptime which will allow for 43m of downtime per month, or 8h 45m of downtime per year.|$|E

The overall reliability of a replication protocol, for example, depends on the probability that some fraction of the replica sites are functioning when data must be read or written. There are several important measures used to quantify system reliability, including time-to-failure (TTF), time-to- repair (TTR), availability, and reliability. Throughout this study, "failure" is defined in a distributed-environment sense; that is, as an inability to access a host.

Cost drivers comprise number of workers, capital invested, and efficiency (fraction of scheduled time actually used for production). The drivers are in turn driven by external factors out of the plant's control and internal factors that are under its control to some degree.

The main causes of the unscheduled downtime were materials, unscheduled maintenance and not staffed. The problem associated with materials was not having mylar to run the printer. The unscheduled maintenance was mainly due to problems with the punches, plates, blankets and knives. Finally, there were occurrences in which the machine was not staffed due to operator absenteeism or the operator helping on another machine. The recommendations made to reduce the unscheduled downtime included having a safety stock of mylar, increasing the preventative maintenance before an order is run, determining how long the punches and blankets last, having two plates available and hiring parttime employees if needed.

Additionally, unplanned downtime could cost several times as much as <b>scheduled</b> <b>downtime.</b> Real time measurement of wear and corrosion can provide crucial information needed to determine an optimal schedule for maintenance to maximise equipment availability while ensuring its reliability. It also leads to savings from optimized spare parts handling and helps minimize costs associated with unnecessary preventative maintenance and negative impact on safety and the environment caused by unexpected equipment failures. This paper presents a technology of 2 ̆ 01 cpainted-on 2 ̆ 01 d ultrasonic transducers that can be integrated into structures to be monitored and accurately measure wear or corrosion induced structure material losses through ultrasonic thickness measurement. These transducers have a small footprint, performance comparable to other commercially available ultrasonic transducers, and can sustain temperatures as high as 400.

40|$|LecturePg. 53 - 72 This paper {{presents}} a typical field problem that most maintenance engineers in any petrochemical plant could encounter. Two 4000 hp through-drive electric motors were totally destroyed when the inboard coupling failed. Market conditions dictated that the compressor {{be put back}} into service as expeditiously as possible. A 3600 rpm prototype 8000 hp motor which could be fitted on the existing foundation was acquired from a power company. The existing half shell journal bearings had to be converted to a full shell design in order to solve a vibration problem. After start-up, the motor was plagued with a random vibration problem which occurred during a load change. Vibration data taken during one of these excursions indicated sub-synchronous frequencies at halfspeed, which were equal in amplitude to the horizontal readings at synchronous speed. A computer model simulating the rotor and bearing systems indicated a whirl instability problem at 1800 rpm. The computer was used to design and optimize a "between the pad," four shoe tilting pad bearing which was installed during the December 1982 turnaround. The paper goes into details on the new bearing design and installation, motor mechanical and hot optical alignment, and start-up data. All of the design and fabrication of the bearings was done while the unit was running, and the bearings were installed during a normal <b>scheduled</b> <b>downtime.</b> The result was a "first try fix.

Safety, reliability, efficiency, and performance {{are some of the}} major concerns and needs for motor system applications. The issue of preventive and condition-based maintenance, online monitoring, system fault detection, diagnosis, and prognosis are of increasing importance. The use of motors in today's industry is extensive and the motors can be exposed to different hostile environments, misoperations,manufacturing defect etc. Different internal motor faults (eg. inter-turn short circuits, short circuit of motor leads, ground faults, bearing and rotor faults) along with external motor faults are expected to happen sooner or later. // Early fault detection, diagnosis, and prognosis allow preventive condition based maintenance to be arranged for the motor system during <b>scheduled</b> <b>downtime</b> and prevent an extended period of downtime caused by system failures. // This thesis deals with the stator Faults and mainly for inter-turn short circuit fault. The faults related to the rotor and bearing also are considered in many research and developed successful fault diagnosis techniques. Literature survey revealed that Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based current spectrum analysis can be successfully applied in rotor and bearing faults analysis. // FFT based Inter-turn short circuit analysis, Air-gap flux sensing by external coils and Partial Discharge (PD) analysis have been discussed. This research has been focused to the negative sequence current analysis, since the FFT augmentation due to inter- turn fault is marginal. // A Power Decomposition Technique (PDT) has been used to derive positive and negative sequence components of measured voltage and current. A multi-phase based motor model is developed to simulate the inter turn fault and the results are verified by practical testing. The practical current waveforms are subjected to power decomposition based sequence component analysis in MAT LAB calculation platform. iv The practical testing has been done for loaded machine and the machine under no load condition to prove no load machine is more suitable for applying this technique.

40|$|LecturePg. 9 - 20 This paper {{discusses}} the rotordynamic instability problems experienced with two separate centrifugal compressors. While {{the root causes}} of the instabilities are very different, the analysis methodology of reconciling the rotordynamic model with measured vibration data was the same. The first problem occurred with a propylene compressor in a Gulf Coast chemical plant that had experienced high journal bearing temperatures for several years. A modified bearing was installed to alleviate the temperature problem; however, a large subsynchronous vibration appeared after the new bearings were installed. A lateral stability analysis shows that the compressor with the modified bearings was very stable with the aerodynamic destabilizing effect predicted by the Alford and/or Wachel equation. A comparison analysis was made of the stability predicted with the original bearings (which were stable) as well as the modified bearings (which were not). This allowed the user to determine the magnitude of the destabilizing forces present in the compressor and design a new bearing that was both stable and would operate at an acceptable temperature. The new bearing was installed and the compressor has operated without the subsynchronous vibration for {{the past year and a}} half. The second problem occurred with a very similar ethylene compressor in a Midwest ethylene plant. The compressor had operated for over two years after an overhaul with low vibration. Then a subsynchronous vibration appeared that was very erratic, but was slowly increasing in amplitude over time. To solve the problem, a rotordynamic analysis was performed that suggested that replacing the bearing would solve the stability problem However, comparison between the measure field vibration and the rotordynamic model did not agree on all points. A more indepth look at the compressor revealed that the increase in subsynchronous vibration was tracking very closely with the balance line differential pressure. This fact, along with the characteristics of the balance piston seal, suggested that a bearing change alone may not completely address the problem A new balance piston seal was designed to reduce its destabilizing effects on the rotor. The compressor was inspected during the next <b>scheduled</b> <b>downtime</b> to determine the cause of the high vibration and install the new balance piston seal and bearings. Examination of the internals revealed a large seal rub in the compressor, but at the dry gas seals, not the balance piston. The rub was addressed and the subsynchronous vibration was eliminated. While the exact source of the destabilizing force was not correctly ?guessed? before disassembly, the indepth rotordynamic analysis did reveal that there was a large destabilizing force in the compressor, and a bearing change alone would not eliminate the vibration. The compressor has been operating without the subsynchronous problem for the past year since the modification...|$|E
