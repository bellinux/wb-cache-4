40|$|A {{preliminary}} investigation of interrelationships between tensile stress-strain characteristics and morphology evolution during deformation is conducted on a commercially available thermoplastic composite with a low-surface-energy nanofibrillating poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) additive. In {{this class of}} composites, the deformation-associated nanofibrillation of the low-surface-energy additive has been hypothesized to provide an additional dissipation mechanism, thereby enhancing the ductility of the composite. This class of composites offers potential for automotive light weighting in exterior and interior body and fascia applications; it is therefore of interest to investigate processing-structure-property interrelationships in these materials. This study specifically probes the interrelationships between the plastic deformation within the matrix and the fibrillation of the low-surface-energy additive; tensile tests are carried out at two different temperatures which are chosen so as to facilitate and suppress plastic deformation within the matrix polymer. Based on these {{preliminary investigation}}s, {{it is noted that}} PTFE fibrillation acts synergistically with the ductile deformation of the matrix resin resulting in higher <b>strains</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> of the composite; the results also suggest that the mechanism of fibrillation-assisted enhancement of <b>strains</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> may not operate in the absence of matrix plasticity...|$|R
50|$|The {{fracture}} toughness of carbon fiber reinforced plastics {{is governed by}} the following mechanisms: 1) debonding between the carbon fiber and polymer matrix, 2) fiber pull-out, and 3) delamination between the CFRP sheets. Typical epoxy-based CFRPs exhibit virtually no plasticity, with less than 0.5% <b>strain</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure.</b> Although CFRPs with epoxy have high strength and elastic modulus, the brittle fracture mechanics present unique challenges to engineers in failure detection since failure occurs catastrophically. As such, recent efforts to toughen CFRPs include modifying the existing epoxy material and finding alternative polymer matrix.

The tensile properties (tensile strength, Young’s modulus and <b>strain</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure)</b> were determined by varying span length. Scanning electron microscopic analysis was also carried out to determine the physical properties of fibers in order to correlate with its strength, Young’s modulus and <b>strain</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure.</b> The Young’s modulus and <b>strain</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> were corrected using newly developed equations.

This is because no extensometer could be used in this test set-up and machine displacement (denoted by α) was used for the modulus determination.

This can be especially true when failure is due to brittle, quasi-brittle, or ductile fracture. When simulating ductile fracture using the finite element method, mesh size effects are also encountered. A common approach for analyzing the response of hull structures due to grounding and impact, for example, is to eliminate elements or to allow elements to split when a critical <b>strain</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> is achieved.

The aim {{of the present study}} is to explain the tensile behavior at room and elevated temperatures of 7075 Al reinforced with varying amounts of SiCp by a casting route followed by extrusion. Microstructural characterization of as cast specimens has revealed the presence of second phases and reaction products at the particle-matrix interface. Tensile results for the extruded and peak aged composites containing 13, 21 and 32 vol% SiCp showed linear increases in the Young's Modulus values with a maximum increase of 78 % for the 32 vol% SiCp composite over the monolithic alloy. An improvement of 18 %, 41 % and 9. 4 % in yield strength resulted on reinforcing the 7075 Al alloy with 13, 21 and 32 vol% SiCp, respectively. The elevated temperature tensile tests indicated high strength retention ability of the composites up to 250 degrees C.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this article}} we utilize a {{concentric}} cylinder model to analyze the stress state in a continuously reinforced coated fiber composite subjected to transverse loading. We incorporate this analysis into a methodical approach to determine an optimal inter-phase coating for the fibers to maximize the composite’s transverse <b>strain</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure.</b> The present study focuses {{on the effect of}} interphase Young’s modulus on the stress state in the matrix material of a composite subjected to constant strain (displacement) boundary con-ditions. We demonstrate, by analytically varying the coating modulus, that an optimum in-terphase property exists which minimizes the maximum principal stress and the strain en-ergy density in the composite material. The minimization of these quantities clearly indicates that failure initiation in a composite with an optimal fiber coating will occur at a significantly larger strain level. Therefore, we postulate (based on the current analysis) that the transverse <b>strain</b> <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> of a composite system can be increased with appropriate fiber coatings. Results and design curves are presented for an AS- 4 /Epon 828 composite system which suggest that for large fiber volume fractions (i. e., 60 %) the optimum coating is an elastomeric material.
