5|$|The A330 {{shares the}} same glass cockpit flight deck layout as the A320 and A340, {{featuring}} electronic instrument displays rather than mechanical gauges. Instead {{of a conventional}} control yoke, the flight deck features side-stick controls, six main displays, and the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), which covers navigation and flight displays, {{as well as the}} Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). Apart from the flight deck, the A330 also has the fly-by-wire system common to the A320 family, the A340, the A350, and the A380. It also features three primary and two secondary flight control systems, as well as a flight envelope limit protection system which prevents manoeuvres from exceeding the aircraft's aerodynamic and <b>structural</b> <b>limits.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1942 Hicks {{took a job}} at the Western Electric Company, {{designing}} and testing quartz crystal oscillators in Kearny, New Jersey. She was the first woman to be employed by Western Electric as an engineer, and she spent three years working there. Upon the death of her father, she joined the Bloomfield, New Jersey based Newark Controls Company, a metalworking firm that her father had founded. Hicks served as chief engineer and then as {{vice president in charge of}} engineering, before purchasing control of the company from her uncle in 1955. Hicks designed and patented a gas density switch later used in the U.S. space program, including the moon landing, and was a pioneer in the field of sensors that detected when devices were reaching <b>structural</b> <b>limits.</b> Hicks authored several technical papers on the gas density switch. While at Newark Controls Hicks pursued a master's degree in physics, which she received in 1949 from the Stevens Institute.|$|E

2500|$|All of the {{biological}} organisms have a limited longevity, and different species of animals and plants have different potentials of longevity. Misrepair-accumulation aging theory [...] suggests that the potential of longevity of an organism is related to its <b>structural</b> complexity. <b>Limited</b> longevity {{is due to the}} <b>limited</b> <b>structural</b> complexity of the organism.

This theory suggests that <b>limited</b> <b>structural</b> complexity and <b>limited</b> longevity are essential for the survival of a species.|$|R
25|$|It {{was only}} in the early 16th century that the modern idea of the galley slave became commonplace. Galley fleets as well as the size of {{individual}} vessels increase in size, which required more rowers. The number of benches could not be increased without lengthening hulls beyond their <b>structural</b> <b>limits,</b> and more than three oars per bench was not practicable. The demand for more rowers also meant that the relatively limited number of skilled oarsmen could not keep up with the demand of large galley fleets. It became increasingly common to man galleys with convicts or slaves, which required a simpler method of rowing. The older method of employing professional rowers using the alla sensile method (one oar per man, with two to three sharing the same bench) was gradually phased out in favor of rowing a scaloccio, which required less skill. A single large oar was used for each bench, with several rowers working it together and the number of oarsmen per oar rose from three up to five. In some very large command galleys, there could be as many as seven to an oar.|$|E
25|$|Wolverine's healing factor {{also affects}} {{a number of}} his {{physical}} attributes by increasing them to superhuman levels. His stamina is sufficiently heightened to the point he can exert himself for numerous hours, even after exposure to powerful tranquilizers. Wolverine's agility and reflexes are also enhanced to levels that are beyond the physical limits of the finest human athlete. Due to his healing factor's constant regenerative qualities, he can push his muscles beyond the limits of the human body without injury. This, coupled by the constant demand placed on his muscles by over one hundred pounds of adamantium, grants him some degree of superhuman strength. Since the presence of the adamantium negates the natural <b>structural</b> <b>limits</b> of his bones, he can lift or move weight that would otherwise damage a human skeleton. He has been depicted breaking steel chains, lifting several men above his head with one arm and throwing them through a wall, lifting Ursa Major (in grizzly bear form) over his head before tossing him across a room, and hauling a concert grand piano, and the platform it rests on, via a harness, while climbing a sheer cliff. Colossus and other allies use Wolverine's endurance and strength when throwing him at high speed in the Fastball Special.|$|E
2500|$|Thermal and <b>structural</b> <b>limits</b> {{were also}} present. Air is heated {{considerably}} when compressed by {{the passage of}} an aircraft at supersonic speeds. The airframe absorbs heat from the surrounding air, the inlet shock cone {{at the front of}} the aircraft becoming the hottest part. The shock cone was composed of fibreglass, necessary because the shock cone also served as a radar radome; a metal shock cone would interfere with the AI 23’s radar emissions. The shock cone would be eventually weakened due to the fatigue caused by the thermal cycles involved in regularly performing high-speed flights. At [...] and , the heating conditions on the shock cone would be similar to those at Sea Level and [...] indicated airspeed, but if the speed was increased to [...] at , the shock cone would be exposed to higher temperatures than those at Mach 1.7. The shock cone was strengthened on the later Lightning F.2A, F.3, F.6, and F.53 models, thus allowing routine operations at up to Mach 2.0.|$|E

50|$|This {{means that}} the metal parts of a large {{aircraft}} need be no thicker or heavier than those of a smaller aircraft.

50|$|The engine also {{lacked a}} number of {{features}} that reduced the realism. For one, the engine did not model gee-induced blackouts or redouts, which allowed unrealistic maneuvers. Additionally, the only <b>structural</b> <b>limits</b> the game checked on were the landing gear or direct impact, so for instance the flaps would not be damaged by lowering them at high speed. This led to {{a number of}} behaviors that would be impossible otherwise, notably dive bombing at hundreds of miles an hour followed by dropping the flaps to allow a multi-tens-of-gee pullout. More detailed <b>structural</b> <b>limits</b> were relatively common in other games of the era.|$|E

Once the Orbiter's guidance verified that Max Q would be within Shuttle <b>structural</b> <b>limits,</b> the main engines were throttled back up to 104.5%; this throttling down and back up was called the [...] "thrust bucket".

An approach for evaluating reinforced concrete crographics. structural frame systems subjected to seismic forces under the framework of performance-based design methodology was developed. The method integrates the design criteria according to the proposed 1997 NEHRP Recommended Provisions for Seismic Regulation for New Buildings & Other Structures (BSSC 1997), <b>structural</b> <b>limit</b> states, pushover analyses, various seismic hazard levels, non-linear time history dynamic analyses and structural fragility curves. Three performance levels (or limit states) consisting of immediate occupancy, life safety, and collapse prevention according to FEMA- 273 (ATC 1997 a) were considered. Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to model the variability of strength and stiffness involved in estimating the <b>structural</b> <b>limit</b> state capacities. Three different hazard levels representing standard frequent event (50 % probability of exceedance in 50 years), design basis event (10 % probability of exceedance in 50 years) and maximum considered event (2 % probability of exceedance in 50 years) according to FEMA- 273 (ATC 1997 a) were used. The probabilistic nature of earthquakes was simulated by using 25 different records of measured time histories, from previous seismic events and scaled to various response spectra intensities (hazard levels). Inter-story was used as an indicative parameter for evaluating structural performance in form of structural fragility curves for the three limit states. The fragility curves developed in this study correlate the conditional probability of exceedance of the three <b>structural</b> performance <b>limit</b> states (BSSC 1997) to the three different seismic hazard levels prescribed by the FEMA- 273 (ATC 1997 a) and FEMA- 274 (ATC l 997 b).
