5000|$|The {{difference}} in moist <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> and the dry rate {{is the cause}} of foehn wind phenomenon (also known as [...] "Chinook winds" [...] in parts of North America). The phenomenon exists because warm moist air rises through orographic lifting up and over the top of a mountain range or large mountain. The temperature decreases with the dry <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate,</b> until it hits the dew point, where water vapor in the air begins to condense. Above that altitude, the <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> decreases to the moist <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> as the air continues to rise. Condensation is also commonly followed by precipitation on the top and windward sides of the mountain. As the air descends on the leeward side, it is warmed by adiabatic compression at the dry <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate.</b> Thus, the foehn wind at a certain altitude is warmer than the corresponding altitude on the windward side of the mountain range. In addition, because the air has lost much of its original water vapor content, the descending air creates an arid region on the leeward side of the mountain.|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} {{generation}} of radiative-convective models a constant value for the critical atmospheric <b>lapse</b> <b>rate,</b> generally 6. 5 K/km, is used. However, the moist <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rates</b> are a better approximation for use in simple climate models. Thus, a comparison of temperature profiles with critical constant and moist <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rates</b> has been made for a one-dimensional radiative-convective model. The commonly used <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> of 6. 5 K/km yields surface temperatures some 1 to 3 K higher than with the use of moist <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rates</b> for both clear sky conditions and a single effective cloud. When multiple clouds are included the constant <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> of 6. 5 K/km yields the lower surface temperatures. More importantly, the surface temperature generated from the constant <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> formulation is more sensitive to changes in carbon dioxide, relative humidity, cloud cover, and surface albedo. For a doubling of CO, the moist <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> formulation yields surface temperature changes 25 to 60 % smaller than does a constant 6. 5 K/km <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> depending on the cloud treatment. 1...|$|R

5000|$|When air rises, {{moist air}} cools {{at a lower}} rate than dry air. That is, for the same {{vertical}} movement, a parcel of moist air will be warmer than a parcel of dry air. This {{is because of the}} condensation of water vapor in the air parcel due to expansion cooling. As water vapor condenses, latent heat is released into the air parcel. Moist air has more water vapor than dry air, so more latent heat is released into the parcel of moist air as it rises. Dry air does not have as much water vapor, therefore dry air cools at a higher rate with vertical movement than moist air. As a result of the latent heat that is released during water vapor condensation, moist air has a relatively lower <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> than dry air.

A saturated parcel of air therefore cools less than a dry one would as it rises (its temperature changes with height at the moist <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate,</b> which is smaller than the dry <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate).</b> Such a saturated parcel of air can achieve buoyancy, and thus accelerate further upward, a runaway condition (instability) even if potential temperature increases with height.

The actual <b>lapse</b> <b>rate,</b> called the environmental <b>lapse</b> <b>rate,</b> is not constant (it can fluctuate throughout the day or seasonally and also regionally), but a normal <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> is 5.5 °C per 1,000 m (3.57 °F per 1,000 ft). Therefore, moving up 100 m on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometres (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors, such as proximity to oceans, can drastically modify the climate. As the altitude increases, the main form of precipitation becomes snow and the winds increase. The temperature continues to drop until the tropopause, at 11000 m, where it does not decrease further. However, this is higher than the highest summit.|$|R
