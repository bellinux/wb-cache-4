5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Palestine in 1918, al-Hajj Muhammad {{supervised}} his family's land possessions and entered the trade business. He {{became one of the}} prominent local grain traders in Palestine {{during the early years of}} the Mandate. Coinciding with this period, al-Hajj Muhammad became an ardent opponent of Zionism and British <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> movement. The 1920 Nebi Musa riots, unrest in 1923 and the 1929 Palestine riots all extended into Tulkarm and al-Hajj Muhammad was angered at the coercive manner in which the British authorities quelled the Palestinian Arab participants. His business eventually went bankrupt after the Mandate adopted new economic policies that saw the import of cheaper, foreign wheat at the expense of local produce. His disaffection of British economic policies partly motivated his future participation in the Palestinian Arab revolt in 1936.|$|E

In the November 2008 election, Pelosi withstood a challenge for her seat by anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, who ran as an independent primarily because of Pelosi's refusal to pursue impeachment.|$|E
25|$|There {{may be a}} {{relationship}} between the alvarezsaurids and the Ornithomimosauria as sister clades within either Thomas Holtz's Arctometatarsalia or Paul Sereno's Ornithomimiformes. The discovery of Haplocheirus, which exhibits transitional features between the more derived alvarezsaurs and other maniraptorans, particularly in relation to the skull structure and development of the hand, has provided further <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> relationship.|$|E
25|$|Changes in the {{way people}} {{perceive}} attachment tend to occur with changes {{in the way}} people perceive support. One study looked at college students' perceptions of attachment to their mothers, fathers, same-sex friends, and opposite-sex friends and found that when students reported changes in attachment for a particular relationship, they usually reported changes in <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> relationship as well. Changes in attachment for one relationship did not affect the perception of support in other relationships. The link between changes in attachment and changes in support was relationship-specific.|$|E

25|$|On 14 March 2008, the United Nations General Assembly {{passed a}} {{non-binding}} resolution {{by a vote}} of 39 to 7, with 100 abstentions, reaffirming Azerbaijan's territorial integrity, expressing <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> country's internationally recognised borders and demanding the immediate withdrawal of all Armenian forces from all occupied territories there. The resolution was supported mainly by members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and GUAM, Azerbaijan is a member in both groups, as well as other nations facing breakaway regions. The resolution was opposed by all three members of the OSCE Minsk Group.|$|E

On 9 October, she entered Inchon Harbor, and remained as <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> area's defense {{until the end of}} the month.

25|$|Che Guevara and Perón were {{sympathetic}} to each other. Pacho O'Donnell states that Che Guevara as Cuban minister attempted {{to arrange for}} the return of Perón to Argentina in the 1960s and sent financial <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> end. Perón however disapproved of Guevara's advocacy of guerrilla warfare as antiquated. In Madrid, Perón and Guevara met twice. These meetings, as the meetings Perón held with other leftists in Madrid (such as Salvador Allende), were arranged with great secrecy to avoid complaints or expulsion from Francoist Spain. According to Enrique Pavón Pereyra who was present at the second meeting between Guevara and Perón in Madrid, Perón would have discouraged and warned Guevara of his guerrilla plans in Bolivia.|$|E

500|$|In royal {{charters}} he {{is often}} given the title [...] "royal chancellor", as he is styled in a 1062 charter in Latin regis cancellarius, {{but this does not}} necessarily mean that there was an official office known as chancellor similar to the later Lord Chancellor's office. Regenbald was probably in charge of Edward's royal clerks and scribes, but his position in the witness lists argues against his holding an actual office, as he is not listed early in the witness lists along with the magnates. He probably performed some of the duties that later were done by the chancellor, but the first chancellor in England is usually held to be Herfast, who held office from around 1069. Some historians, including David Bates, hold that Regenbald was chancellor, however. Some <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> position is the fact that Domesday Book lists Regenbald as [...] "chancellor". The entire issue of whether Regenbald was a [...] "true" [...] chancellor or not is bound up in the debate amongst medievalists about whether there was a recognisable chancery in England prior to the Norman Conquest. One school of thought, led by Pierre Chaplais, argues that no such office existed prior to the Conquest. Another group argues that there was, and among this group is the historian Simon Keynes. In Regenbald's case, a number of the documents that give him the title [...] "chancellor" [...] are either forgeries or have been altered in the copying process. Others, however, are not easily shown to be spurious.|$|E
500|$|In {{regard to}} Lithuania, Dmowski didn't view Lithuanians {{as having a}} strong {{national}} identity, and viewed their social organization as tribal. Those areas of Lithuania that had either Polish majorities or minorities were claimed by Dmowski {{on the grounds of}} self-determination. In the areas with Polish minorities, the Poles would act as a civilizing influence; only the northern part of Lithuania, which had a solid Lithuanian majority, was Dmowski willing to concede to the Lithuanians. His initial plans for Lithuania involved giving it an autonomy within a Polish state. This caused Dmowski to have very acrimonious disputes with the Lithuanian delegation at Paris. With regard to the former Austrian province of East Galicia, Dmowski claimed that the local Ukrainians were quite incapable of ruling themselves and also required the civilizing influence of Polish leadership. In addition, Dmowski wished to acquire the oil fields of Galicia. His <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> was however more lackluster than that for other regions, and he opposed Piłsudski's proposal of an alliance or federation with Ukrainians. From the Allied powers only the French supported Polish claims to Galica wholeheartedly. In the end, it was the actual fighting on the ground in Galicia, and not the decisions of the diplomats in Paris, that decided that the region would be part of Poland. The French did not back Dmowski's aspirations in the Cieszyn Silesia region, and instead supported the claims of Czechoslovakia. Dmowski since a long time praised Czechs as model for national restoration in face of Germanization, and despite his dispute with Czech political leaders, his opinion of the Czech people as a whole remained positive ...|$|E
500|$|Many westerners, {{including}} Republicans, were {{supporters of}} free silver. McKinley's advisors had anticipated {{there would be}} strong feelings about the currency question, and pressed the candidate for a decision on what the party platform should say on the subject. McKinley had hoped to avoid this issue; his surrogates had presented him as firmly for the gold standard in the East, where <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> policy was strong. Western supporters, who often favored silver, were told he was sympathetic to the bimetallic cause. In the following years, several McKinley associates, including publisher H. H. Kohlsaat and Wisconsin's Henry C. Payne, took credit for including an explicit mention of the gold standard in the platform's currency plank (for they deemed it vital to the Republican victory in November), {{but it was not}} inserted in the draft until Hanna consulted with McKinley by telephone. The silver Republicans from the West were led by Colorado Senator Henry M. Teller, who drafted a plank promoting free silver, only to see it voted down in the drafting committee, and in the full Platform Committee. Teller was determined to have the full convention vote on his language, although it was certain he would lose as most Republican delegates favored the gold standard. The debate was held on June 18. After Teller's minority report was voted down and the gold plank adopted by an overwhelming majority, 23 delegates, including Teller and his Senate colleagues Frank Cannon of Utah and Fred Dubois of Idaho, walked out of the convention and thus left the Republican Party. Amid a tumultuous scene, an angry Hanna was seen standing on a chair, shouting at the departing men, [...] "Go! Go! Go!" ...|$|E
