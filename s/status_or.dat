Additionally, the hurricane attained Category 4 status further south {{than any other}} North Atlantic hurricane, at 10.6°N. At the time, Ivan was the sixth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record; it has since dropped to eleventh. Throughout its duration, Ivan maintained winds of major hurricane <b>status</b> <b>or</b> greater {{for a total of}} 10days, establishing an Atlantic hurricane record. Lasting as a tropical cyclone for a total of 450hours, Ivan was the tenth-longest-tracked Atlantic hurricane on record.|$|E
5|$|The 1939 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season officially began on June 12, 1939, and lasted until November 7, 1939.

The 1939 season had below normal activity, with only six tropical storms, of which two became hurricanes and one became a major hurricane, equivalent to Category 3 <b>status</b> <b>or</b> higher on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The first tropical cyclone formed on June 12, and the last dissipated on November 6.|$|E

5|$|After being named, Gamede quickly intensified, and the JTWC {{classified}} it with {{winds of}} 120km/h (75mph) early on February 22. As it turned west-southwestward, an eye feature became evident on satellite imagery, and the JTWC upgraded Gamede to tropical cyclone <b>status,</b> <b>or</b> the equivalence of a minimal hurricane. Subsequently, its intensification rate slowed somewhat, due to restricted outflow. At 0000UTC on February 23 the MFR upgraded the storm to Tropical Cyclone Gamede, and shortly thereafter it passed over St. Brandon island. Subsequently, outflow became better established, and the JTWC unofficially estimated the cyclone attained winds of 185km/h (115mph) late on February 23 about 250km (400mi) north-northeast of Mauritius island. Initially it was forecast to strengthen further, though slight weakening occurred when a nearby upper-level trough restricted outflow.|$|E

After his support for the World War I with Indian combat troops, and the failure of Khilafat movement in preserving the rule of Caliph in Turkey, followed by a collapse in Muslim support for his leadership, some such as Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh questioned his values and non-violent approach. While many Hindu leaders championed a demand for immediate independence, Gandhi revised his own call to a one-year wait, instead of two.|$|E

Michaelis, a West Point graduate known as an effective commander, assigned the 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry, {{to make contact with}} the first North Korean attacks. On the morning of July 23, Lieutenant Colonel Gilbert J. Check moved the 1st Battalion northward toward Poun from the Hwanggan assembly area. He took up defensive positions in the evening near the village of Sangyong-ni, south of Poun. The battalion assumed responsibility for that sector at 17:00 after South Korean troops fell back through its position.

5|$|In {{most current}} cultures, {{it is more}} typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so. An American study shows {{significant}} correlation between hair length and age, which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women. A significant correlation was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health. Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, {{these results indicate that}} hair length and quality can act as a cue to a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. The correlation between the woman's hair length and marital <b>status,</b> <b>or</b> number of children, was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length and age.|$|E
