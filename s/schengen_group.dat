50|$|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg {{has long}} been a {{prominent}} supporter of European political and economic integration. In efforts foreshadowing European integration, Luxembourg and Belgium in 1921 formed the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union (BLEU) to create an inter-exchangeable currency and a common customs regime. Luxembourg {{is a member of the}} Benelux Economic Union and was one of the founding members of the United Nations and the European Economic Community (now the European Union). It also participates in the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Group</b> (named after the Luxembourg village where the agreements were signed), whose goal is the free movement of citizens among member states. At the same time, the majority of Luxembourgers have consistently believed that European unity makes sense only in the context of a dynamic transatlantic relationship, and thus have traditionally pursued a pro-NATO, pro-US foreign policy.|$|E

In connection with this the idea of EU citizenship was invented in the Treaty of European Community. Using such powers each citizen is eligible for moving and staying in the whole EU territory. In spite of this Schengen Convention introduce distinction between external and internal border of Schengen’s area. The external frontier are borders between nations out of <b>Schengen</b> <b>group.</b> The controls over them are executed according to uniform criteria. As long as the political situation in Europe is not change, Poland will stay as the border’s state of EU and some people will be put at risk of the border crossing action. The inhabitants of the areas situated next to routes lead to the border and the inhabitants of areas situated directly next to the border crossing are such people. It is not connected only with functioning of the border crossing point itself but also with the action of all grounds which come under it. The problem is quite serious because the Polish border is 3500 km in length and there are 200 Polish border crossings...|$|E

The EEA countries (with the exception of the UK and Ireland) and Switzerland have signed the Schengen treaty. Several of the new member states have not yet fully implemented it.|$|R
30|$|Today, Spain {{is part of}} the <b>Schengen</b> zone a <b>group</b> of {{countries}} in Europe which have no internal border controls, so their citizens can cross into the different countries without showing a passport. As EaP countries are not members of the Schengen zone, they are treated as other non-EU migrants. This implies that citizens from EaP countries need a visa to work in Spain in addition to other requirements asked to non-EU citizens, such as a valid passport, no criminal record, private health insurance, documentation to justify the purpose of the trip (visiting friends, work or holiday), a return travel ticket and some financial guarantee (a minimum of € 600). As a result of the strict entry requirements, a substantial fraction of non-EU citizens enter the country legally through a temporary visa or permit, such as a tourist or a family-visit visa, followed by an overstay – implying that their legal status in the country has expired.|$|R
