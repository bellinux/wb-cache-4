5|$|In September 2010, Citroën do Brasil {{launched}} the Citroën C3 Aircross in Brazil and Argentina. The {{car is a}} C3 Picasso-based mini Sport Utility Vehicle with styling differences including: raised suspension, chrome roof bars and mirror covers, side skirts, and a rear <b>spare</b> <b>tyre.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{elements}} of the US board were unchanged, leading to apparent idiosyncrasies. The police officer on Go To Jail is wearing a New York City Police Department hat, not a Metropolitan Police helmet, while the car on Free Parking has a Whitewall <b>spare</b> <b>tyre,</b> which was uncommon in the UK. The term Community Chest was a welfare support system present in the Great Depression {{and has not been}} used in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The constellation's {{brightest}} star, Alpha Gruis, is {{also known}} as Alnair and appears as a 1.7-magnitude blue-white star. Beta Gruis is a red giant variable star with a minimum magnitude of 2.3 and a maximum magnitude of 2.0. Six star systems have been found to have planets: the red dwarf Gliese 832 is one of the closest stars to Earth to have a planetary system. Another—WASP-95—has a planet that orbits every two days. Deep-sky objects found in Grus include the planetary nebula IC 5148, also known as the <b>Spare</b> <b>Tyre</b> Nebula, and a group of four interacting galaxies known as the Grus Quartet.|$|E
50|$|Pello Revolvers {{formed in}} 2001 and signed to Massive Decline of Power Against Recordings. They {{released}} the self-titled Pello Revolvers in 2003, Borg Mesch in 2004 and No <b>Spare</b> <b>Tyres</b> in 2005.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Spare</b> <b>Tyres</b> is a 1967 British short comedy film {{directed}} by Michael J. Lane and featuring Terence Alexander, Judy Franklin, Pauline Yates, and Frank Finlay. Dennis {{and his wife}} {{move to a new}} house. Discovering a set of tyres in the garage, he spends {{the rest of the day}} trying to get rid of them.|$|R
50|$|The TAC3 was a 4WD {{concept car}} by Toyota, first {{shown at the}} 1983 Tokyo Motor Show. The driver sat in a central position, while two {{passengers}} sat behind in separate bucket seats. There was no roof but a rear roll bar provided roll over protection. The TAC3 was shown with a small trailer that also held 4 <b>spare</b> <b>tyres</b> on its towing arm.|$|R
25|$|The A1 was a fully enclosed, 4-door sedan, {{with normal}} front doors and forward-opening suicide-style rear doors. It was heavily {{based on the}} Chrysler built DeSoto Airflow; Toyoda bought an Airflow and {{disassembled}} it the year before producing the A1. The front window was {{a single piece of}} flat glass with a top-mounted wiper on the driver's side. There were 3 windows per side, one for the front door (without a quarter light window), one for the rear door and one behind the rear door. A <b>spare</b> <b>tyre</b> was mounted on the nearly vertical boot lid.|$|E
25|$|Conditions {{improved}} in the 1930s and riders {{were allowed to}} accept a rain jacket, a <b>spare</b> <b>tyre</b> and a pump, but only in an emergency and at the judges' discretion. A change of bike was allowed only if a frame, wheel or handlebar broke, but riders were still expected to ride with spare tyres and a pump. Riders in the 1940s had to hand their bikes to officials {{the day before the}} race to have them identified with a lead seal, later with a ring similar to that fitted to racing pigeons. In that way the judges, or commissaires, could see if a rider had illegally changed bikes.|$|E
500|$|The Imme R100 {{is noted}} for its simple and {{innovative}} design. Its advanced features include single-sided suspension front and rear, interchangeable wheels front and rear with the option of a <b>spare</b> <b>tyre,</b> the complete drivetrain mounted on the swingarm, and the swingarm tube used as the exhaust pipe. Remarking on the R100 being displayed in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum exhibition [...] "The Art of the Motorcycle", Ultan Guilfoyle, curatorial adviser at the museum, said: [...] "It's my favourite unknown bike. There are ideas there that are 40 years ahead of their time." [...] An R100 is on permanent display at the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum.|$|E

5000|$|Known {{weaknesses}} included vibrations {{from the}} front end (largely fixed under warranty), cracking hinges on the rear door (due to the <b>spare</b> <b>tyre's</b> weight) and rust on rear window frames. The RD28T motor suffered from head gasket issues when driven with a heavy foot. European five-speed gearboxes suffered from bearing failures in fifth gear at high mileages. However, the TD42 was highly reliable [...] Patrols {{are known for their}} strong axles and good limited slip differential (when so equipped).|$|R
500|$|Replacing the {{outgoing}} Commodore Executive and Acclaim (nameplates introduced in 1983 and 1993, respectively), the Omega offers a halfway point {{in terms of}} equipment levels. The most significant gain over the Executive is the electronic stability control system (Bosch version 8.0) now standard across the range. Like all VE models, the Omega uses a [...] "space saver" [...] <b>spare</b> <b>tyre,</b> which has come under scrutiny. The tyre can be driven for [...] at a maximum speed of [...] Concerns have been raised by the public over its usefulness in remote Australian outback areas, far from any tyre repair centres and asserts {{that it is a}} cost-cutting measure. Similar concerns have been raised in the media, although Holden maintains that this is a weight-saving feature and allows for full-size spare tyres to be purchased at an additional cost. Likewise, critics found the omission of standard air conditioning for the Omega model unforgivable, given both the overall hot Australian climate, and the cost of the car. This, however, was rectified in the MY09 upgrade of the Omega (see below).|$|E
50|$|The 23s {{failed to}} pass the scrutineering on several {{technical}} grounds, including an insufficient windscreen height, fuel tank capacity being too large, turning circle too large, ground clearance too small, and the <b>spare</b> <b>tyre</b> requirement not met. Fitted with a makeshift tall wind screen, all but the <b>spare</b> <b>tyre</b> issue was rectified almost immediately.|$|E

50|$|Pro tech zonesThese are {{situated}} at all waterpoints. They {{are for the}} use of UCI-registered riders only. The organisers will transport one wheel set and one tool bag per two-rider team to each of the zones for every stage. The content of the tool bag is at the team’s discretion and may consist of anything riders wish to use - tools, <b>spares,</b> <b>tyre</b> sealant, food, waterbottles, sunscreen. No technical or mechanical assistance is provided and teams may only access their own boxes and wheelsets.|$|R
5000|$|Brichard was {{selected}} for the 1926 Tour de France, which would enter the history books as the longest ever tour. Brichard had to abandon the tour in the first leg from Évian-les-Bains to Mulhouse, due to a leaking tyre, as he had already consumed all his <b>spare</b> <b>tyres.</b> He continued to race {{for a few more}} years, while also continuing to work in the mines. In 1930 he retired from both cycling and the mining industry, and opened his own liquer and wine distillery and shop.|$|R
50|$|Van der Poel {{suffered}} successive punctures on laps 2, 3 and 4 {{but each}} time closely before the pit lane, not losing much time but allowing van Aert {{to close the gap}} each lap, finally getting back together on lap 4. Behind the two leaders the gap kept widening, however the first chaser changed often as punctures caused many riders to drop back from a good position. Several riders suffered several punctures and some riders even dropped out of the race as they ran out of <b>spare</b> <b>tyres,</b> including 2008 World Champion Lars Boom.|$|R
50|$|Companies {{producing}} participatory work include National Theatre Wales, <b>Spare</b> <b>Tyre</b> Theatre Company and The Republic of The Imagination (TROTI), Wales.|$|E
5000|$|... "stepney" [...] {{refers to}} a <b>spare</b> <b>tyre.</b> The word is a genericised {{trademark}} originating from the Stepney Spare Motor Wheel, itself named after Stepney Street, in Llanelli, Wales.|$|E
50|$|The {{liquid gas}} tank {{is built into}} the spare wheel well so it does not {{compromise}} on passenger and loading space of the Sharan's interior, although it does eliminate the <b>spare</b> <b>tyre.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Huckley,' {{said the}} policeman. 'H-u-c-k-l-e-y,' and wrote {{something}} in his note-book at which young Ollyett protested. A large red man on a grey horse who had been watching us {{from the other side}} of the hedge shouted an order we could not catch. The policeman laid his hand on the rim of the right driving-door (Woodhouse carries his <b>spare</b> <b>tyres</b> aft), and it closed on the button of the electric horn. The grey horse at once bolted, and we could hear the rider swearing all across the landscape.|$|R
25|$|The Ronde, in {{its first}} decades, {{followed}} the general rule that each racer was responsible for his own problems. Help from others was banned and riders carried <b>spare</b> <b>tyres</b> looped round their shoulders to cope with punctures. It could take {{two or three minutes}} to change and inflate a tyre, longer if it was cold or there were other problems. Tyres weighed around 500g (compared to currently around 200g). A rim or any other part of the bike that broke spelled the end of the race and still left the rider with the problem of getting to the finish.|$|R
50|$|Bobet {{was one of}} {{the first}} riders to employ a {{personal}} soigneur, taking his lead from Coppi. He took on Raymond Le Bert, a physiotherapist from St-Brieuc, as well as a secretary and a driver. Le Bert booked him hotel rooms between half-stages of the Tour, against the Tour's rules. Riders were supposed to use a dormitory provided for them. When the Tour insisted riders carry <b>spare</b> <b>tyres,</b> usually round their shoulders, Le Bert gave Bobet tubulars with the inner tubes taken out, useless to ride on but lighter to carry if that's what the rules insisted.|$|R
5000|$|Rangga (short series only, 1997-2000): Deluxe Sport Edition (Same as SGX but {{including}} new front fascia, SUV-like body kit, higher ground clearance, <b>spare</b> <b>tyre</b> attached on boot, and refined interior with suede seat cover & door trim.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of a supercharger to the Mk I Cooper S required that the battery be relocated into {{the rear of the}} car — leaving no room for a <b>spare</b> <b>tyre,</b> so the S models came with run-flat tyres.|$|E
5000|$|The Volvo Venus Bilo was {{a concept}} car {{revealed}} by Volvo Cars in 1933. It was a [...] design with rear hinged doors and conventional {{doors in the}} side to access the engine bay. It was designed {{to have a great}} loading capacity. Nine specially designed suitcases could be fitted into spaces in the back and a compartments in the right front fender (the left fender contained <b>spare</b> <b>tyre</b> and tools). A second <b>spare</b> <b>tyre</b> in the rear was used as a bumper. The design was done by Gustaf Ericsson (son of Lars Magnus Ericsson). It was based on a Volvo PV655 chassis and the coachwork was done by Gustaf Nordbergs Vagnfabrik AB in 1932.|$|E

5000|$|On 14 May 1911 the 24 HP {{made its}} racing debut at the 6th Targa Florio. A pair of special 24 HP tipo corsa (racing type) were {{built for the}} occasion, with 2-seat baquet bodywork, an {{additional}} 30-litre fuel tank behind the seats, two <b>spare</b> <b>tyres,</b> and an engine tuned to [...] at 2,400 rpm. Weighing 870 kg (as opposed to 1000 kg for a torpedo-bodied standard 24 HP), the car had {{a top speed of}} 110 km/h.Both drivers (Nino Franchini and Ugo Ronzoni) had to retire on the third and last lap of the course—the first because of an accident, the second because of physical exhaustion.|$|R
50|$|Sanchore has {{a growing}} {{automobile}} <b>spare</b> parts and <b>tyre</b> market and an industrial and commercial hardware market.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, the 335i {{became the}} first 3 Series model to be sold with a {{turbocharged}} petrol engine. The E9X family also saw the introduction of run-flat tyres to the 3 Series range. Consequently, cars with run-flats are not equipped with a <b>spare</b> <b>tyre.</b>|$|E

The {{car is a}} C3 Picasso-based mini Sport Utility Vehicle with styling differences including: raised suspension, chrome roof bars and mirror covers, side skirts, and a rear <b>spare</b> <b>tyre.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{base level}} had the 2.0 litre, 141 hp engine, air conditioning, driver and {{passenger}} airbags, ABS, a traction control system, halogen headlamps, power steering, adjustable steering column, electrically adjustable driver's side seating, a six-speaker amplified audio system, heated folding side mirrors, self-dimming interior rear-view mirror, and a single-use <b>spare</b> <b>tyre.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Le Mans had {{a higher}} tuned version of the 972 cc inline-four, with higher camshafts, bigger and better cooled oil sump, and a counterbalanced crankshaft. Power climbed to [...] and a {{close-ratio}} gearbox was fitted. The frame was dropped behind the front wheels and thus underslung at the rear. No running boards, a 12 imp gal external fuel tank and twin <b>spare</b> <b>tyres</b> finished the competition appearance. As opposed to the competing MGs, the Singer had more powerful and dependable hydraulic Lockheed brakes. The Nine Le Mans, while not particularly successful at the track which gave it its name, clocked up an impressive number of wins at hillclimbs, trials, and various endurance races such as the Liège-Rome-Liège and the Alpine Cup Rally. In 1935 a four-seater version of the Le Mans was also available, somewhat of a hybrid of the Sports and the regular Le Mans.|$|R
50|$|The car had no luggage {{compartment}} and the <b>spare</b> wheel and <b>tyre</b> were {{carried in a}} metal case positioned vertically above the back bumper with a fold-out luggage rack.|$|R
40|$|In November 1998, {{the largest}} officially-documented dengue {{haemorrhagic}} fever (DHF) epidemic since 1943 occurred in Taiwan. This epidemic resulted in more than 110 dengue fever (DF) cases and at least 36 DHF cases. A case-control {{study was conducted to}} explore the risk factors of dengue infection. Thirty-four cases and 68 matched controlled cases were included for statistical analysis. After further adjusting the confounders and intra-household correlation by random effect model, three distinctive risk factors were identified. These were: the presence of empty houses, <b>spare</b> <b>tyres,</b> neighbourhood ponds or temples (OR= 3. 17, 95 % CI: 0. 95 - 10. 63) which was first identified in the papers, water containers with covers in the house (OR= 5. 77, 95 % CI= 1. 08 - 30. 8), and screened windows and doors (OR= 0. 71, 95 % CI= 0. 32 - 0. 89). Control measures were aimed at these risk factors and the epidemic subsided in January 1999 when the last dengue case was reported...|$|R
