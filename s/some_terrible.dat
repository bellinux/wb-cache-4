5|$|The Honduras Packet {{reached the}} Black River in November 1822. Bemused {{to find a}} country rather {{different}} from the Sketchs descriptions, and no sign of St Joseph, the emigrants set up camp on the shore, assuming that the Poyaisian authorities would soon contact them. They sent numerous search parties inland; one, guided by natives who recognised the name St Joseph, found some long-forgotten foundations and rubble. Hall quickly came to the private conclusion that MacGregor must have duped them, but reasoned that announcing such concerns prematurely would only demoralise the party and cause chaos. A few weeks after their arrival, {{the captain of the}} Honduras Packet abruptly and unilaterally sailed away amid a fierce storm; the emigrants found themselves alone apart from the natives and two American hermits. Comforting the settlers with vague assurances that the Poyaisian government would find them if they just stayed where they were, Hall set out for Cape Gracias a Dios, hoping to make contact with the Mosquito king or find another ship. Most of the emigrants found it impossible to believe that the Cazique had deliberately misled them, and posited that blame must lie elsewhere, or that there must have been <b>some</b> <b>terrible</b> misunderstanding.|$|E

25|$|To {{commemorate the}} Master's forty-fifth anniversary, Big Finish did a trilogy of audios {{featuring}} the Master in 2016; And You Will Obey Me pits the Fifth Doctor against the Beevers {{incarnation of the}} Master, seeking to regain his body after an unspecified attack left him seriously injured and hunted, and Vampire of the Mind pits the Sixth Doctor against the MacQueen incarnation of the Master, who is seeking to drain the neural energy of the Doctor and various Earth scientists to restore his own mind after <b>some</b> <b>terrible</b> accident. These two storylines come together in The Two Masters, in which the Seventh Doctor faces both of these incarnations of the Master at once and realizes {{that they have been}} transferred into each other's bodies as part of a complex plan by the Cult of the Heretic, a cult dedicated to a Time Lord who sought to unmake the universe. The resulting paradox of the two Masters in each other's bodies, coupled {{with the fact that the}} Cult manipulated the MacQueen Master into attacking the Beevers incarnation, resulting in the crippled form witnessed in The Deadly Assassin, is revealed to be causing the universe to collapse. The Masters are able to restore themselves to their own bodies, steal the Doctor's TARDIS to trap him on a battlecruiser about to crash, and finish unmaking the universe before destroying the Cult, but the Doctor manages to track them using the Master's own TARDIS. With the Cult destroyed, the Doctor uses the Masters' discarded weapons to immobilize the two Masters before using the Cult's equipment to rebuild the universe as it was, with his only changes being to send both Masters back to their original locations in time and space and save the life of a temporary companion whom the Master had killed.|$|E

500|$|Tracy was {{prone to}} bouts of {{depression}} and anxiety: he was described by Mrs. Tracy as having [...] "the most volatile disposition I've ever seen—up in the clouds one minute {{and down in the}} depths the next. And when he's low, he's very, very low." [...] He was plagued by insomnia throughout his life. As a result, Tracy became dependent on barbiturates to sleep, followed by dexedrine to function. Hepburn, who adopted a nursing role towards Tracy, was unable to understand her partner's unhappiness. She wrote in her autobiography: [...] "What was it?... Never at peace... Tortured by some sort of guilt. <b>Some</b> <b>terrible</b> misery." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Missing You" [...] {{received}} generally {{negative comments}} from the critics, who criticised the use of Auto-Tuned vocals and said that [...] "the production was lacking, making the choice to release it is a single confusing. with] <b>some</b> <b>terrible</b> autotone ... and a trance-y backdrop that never quite reaches the places it promises." [...] Tony Falls of Virgin Media was also {{highly critical of the}} song awarding it zero out of ten. [...] "Never have a group got by with so little a contribution to music, but so big a contribution to rolling back feminist progress. 'Missing You' sounds like an album track. Not something you’d hear as a comeback track that would uplift your lost consciousness about the girls’ disappearance. The idea of shooting the video in Spain for this type of song is a nice choice, but Frankie is overly tanned. Please kill me. A vacuous set of reviews for a vacuous group of girls." ...|$|E
500|$|During his career, Ford {{developed}} a reputation as an immensely physical centre-forward, especially toward opposition goalkeepers. His Wales international teammate John Charles commented on his playing style, stating that [...] "He used to bang everybody and knock {{them out of the}} way, he was never frightened" [...] but also described him as a wonderful person. Former England international Gil Merrick accused Ford of maltreating goalkeepers in his autobiography, although Ford later sued Merrick, stating that he had never been cautioned or sent off over his style of play, and received an apology and the withdrawal of the book over the claim. Ford himself stated that his personality was transformed once he stepped onto a football pitch, describing himself as [...] "Like an animal" [...] but also commenting that he was simply [...] "doing his job and doing it well" [...] Billy Bingham later stated [...] "He got <b>some</b> <b>terrible</b> knocks from goalkeepers but he also knew how to dish it out and he never complained to refs".|$|E
60|$|Some murders are {{committed}} in hot blood and furious rage; some, in deliberate revenge; <b>some,</b> in <b>terrible</b> despair; <b>some</b> (but not many) for mere gain; some, {{for the removal}} of an object dangerous to the murderer's peace or good name; some, to win a monstrous notoriety.|$|R

500|$|Millett wrote {{several books}} on women's lives from a feminist perspective. For instance, in the book The Basement: Meditations on a Human Sacrifice (1979), {{completed}} over four years, she chronicled the torture and murder of Indianapolis teenager Sylvia Likens by Gertrude Baniszewski in 1965 that had preoccupied her for 14 years. With a feminist perspective, she explored {{the story of the}} defenseless girl and the dynamics of the individuals involved in her sexual, physical and emotional abuse. Biographer Roberta M. Hooks wrote, [...] "Quite apart from any feminist polemics, The Basement can stand alone as an intensely felt and movingly written study of the problems of cruelty and submission." [...] Millett said of the motivation of the perpetrator: [...] "It {{is the story of the}} suppression of women. Gertrude seems to have wanted to administer <b>some</b> <b>terrible</b> truthful justice to this girl: that this was what it was to be a woman".|$|E
2500|$|Franklin has {{a lifelong}} passion for science fiction {{and has been}} a guest curator on topics about Star Trek and Star Wars. His book War Stars was cited by leftist philosopher and {{linguist}} Noam Chomsky, who bemoaned the prevalence of a recurring theme in popular literature that [...] "we're about to face destruction from <b>some</b> <b>terrible,</b> awesome enemy." [...] Franklin's research explored America's fascination with superweapons. He argued in War Stars: The Superweapon and the American Imagination that popular American books and novels in preceding decades and centuries, which dealt with the themes of superweapons, may have helped to shape national thinking on this subject. When the movie Independence Day appeared in 1996, Franklin said [...] "Fundamental to the historical experience of [...] culture are alien invaders who came armed with a superior technology and wiped out the culture that was here." [...] His book Future Perfect: American Science Fiction of the Nineteenth Century (1966) identified American authors including Washington Irving, Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville as pioneers of this genre who wrote science fiction, contrary to popular understanding. His Robert A. Heinlein: America as Science Fiction won the Eaton Award in 1981, and contributed to Franklin receiving the Pilgrim Award for lifetime scholarship in 1983. In his 1988 War Stars: The Superweapon and the American Imagination,selected by Choice as the Outstanding Academic Book of 1989, Franklin turned his interest in science fiction to an examination of the American fascination with superweapons. [...] His book presents a view that, ironically, from Robert Fulton’s submarine Nautilus in the 18th century to the death-dealing weaponry of the late 20th century, superweapons ostensibly designed to end war have proved capable of exterminating the human species. The expanded 2008 edition explores how this cultural history led to the seemingly permanent state of warfare of the 21st century. War Stars is informed by Franklin’s own earlier experience as a navigator and intelligence officer in the Strategic Air Command. In 1990 he was named the Distinguished Scholar for the International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts. In 1991, he was Guest Curator for the Star Trek and the Sixties exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution; this show subsequently traveled to the Hayden Planetarium.|$|E

[...] Platt also stated that, [...] "The moment-to-moment gameplay of Brave’s sequences are fairly fun (though bugs are far more frequent than they should be), but the beginning and ending Courage segments are frustrating, poorly designed, and ridiculously glitchy." ...|$|R

5000|$|MaryAnn Sleasman from TV.com, wrote, [...] "One of {{the themes}} that {{consistently}} appears in Grimms Wesen stories is the difficult balancing of existence in both the Wesen world and the human world.
