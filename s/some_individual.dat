5|$|In {{response}} to the ruling, some students created web-based publications not subsidized by the school. <b>Some</b> <b>individual</b> states have also responded with laws designating student newspapers as public forums and offering them greater First Amendment protection. Experts from the Student Press Law Center say the case has meant that fewer lawsuits regarding student censorship make it to court.|$|E

Some of the paler individuals appear to have vein-like markings extending vertically from the lateral line. In <b>some</b> <b>individuals</b> the dorsal spine is marginally shorter than the longest fin rays, but in other individuals the reverse is true. No clear pattern or delineation can be made between morphotypes and <b>some</b> <b>individuals</b> seem to be intermediate.

50|$|<b>Some</b> <b>individuals</b> have a {{paraphilia}} for {{a specific}} type of panty.

5|$|Truthiness is {{the belief}} or {{assertion}} that a particular statement is true based on the intuition or perceptions of <b>some</b> <b>individual</b> or individuals, without regard to evidence, logic, intellectual examination, or facts.

5|$|Although Nash was {{responsible}} for the street's general development, <b>some</b> <b>individual</b> buildings were designed by Charles Robert Cockerell and Sir John Soane, amongst others. By 1819, the Crown were receiving regular rent and the street was becoming established. At first, it was called New Street and became a dividing line between Soho, which had declined socially and economically, and the fashionable squares and streets of Mayfair to the west. Carlton House did not last long following completion of the works and was demolished in 1829, to be replaced by Carlton House Terrace, also designed by Nash.|$|E
5|$|Ground-based radio {{images taken}} using the VLA {{revealed}} seven radio {{sources in the}} HDF, all of which correspond to galaxies visible in the optical images. The field has also been surveyed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and the MERLIN array of radio telescopes at 1.4GHz; the combination of VLA and MERLIN maps made at wavelengths of 3.5 and 20cm have located 16 radio sources in the HDF-N field, with many more in the flanking fields. Radio images of <b>some</b> <b>individual</b> sources in the field have been made with the European VLBI Network at 1.6GHz with a higher resolution than the Hubble maps.|$|E

5|$|The spans were {{assembled}} on site. Staging {{was laid}} and rails {{put in place}} to carry a travelling crane. The long beams were hoisted in place first, followed by the vertical bracings, and then the outer and inner plates of the top chordal trusses and the diagonals. The whole structure was bolted together at first, and later riveted by blacksmiths using hand-operated forges. <b>Some</b> <b>individual</b> spans were completed within a week, with contractors being complimented on the efficiency of their work.|$|E
5|$|According to {{statistics}} released by The Kennel Club, Cavaliers were the sixth most popular {{dog in the}} United Kingdom in 2007 with 11,422 registrations in a single year. Labrador Retrievers were the most popular with 45,079 registrations in that year. Their popularity {{is on the rise}} in America; in 1998 they were the 56th most popular breed but in both 2007 and 2008 they were the 25th most popular. They ranked higher in <b>some</b> <b>individual</b> US cities in the 2008 statistics, being eighth in both Nashville and Minneapolis-St.Paul, seventh in Boston, Atlanta and Washington D.C., and sixth in both New York City and San Francisco. The breed's popularity has continued to grow, ranking in 18th place in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Fungal mycelia {{can become}} {{visible to the}} naked eye, for example, on various {{surfaces}} and substrates, such as damp walls and spoiled food, where they are commonly called molds. Mycelia grown on solid agar media in laboratory petri dishes are usually referred to as colonies. These colonies can exhibit growth shapes and colors (due to spores or pigmentation) that can be used as diagnostic features in the identification of species or groups. <b>Some</b> <b>individual</b> fungal colonies can reach extraordinary dimensions and ages {{as in the case of}} a clonal colony of Armillaria solidipes, which extends over an area of more than 900ha (3.5 square miles), with an estimated age of nearly 9,000years.|$|E

5|$|In general, humans {{consider}} woodpeckers in a favourable light; {{they are}} viewed as interesting birds and fascinating to watch as they drum or forage. However, their activities are not universally appreciated. <b>Some</b> <b>individual</b> birds habitually excavate holes in buildings, fencing and utility poles, and there are various reverberatory structures on buildings such as gutters, downspouts, chimneys, vents and aluminium sheeting, that the birds find attractive for drumming. Houses with shingles or wooden boarding are also attractive as possible nesting or roosting sites, especially when close to large trees or woodland. Several exploratory holes may be made, especially at the junctions of vertical boards or {{at the corners of}} tongue-and-groove boarding. The birds may also drill holes in houses as they forage for insect larvae and pupae hidden behind the woodwork.|$|E
5|$|Tapaculos are {{the most}} {{primitive}} family of suboscines, divided into 12 genera containing 60 species. Scytalopus, the genus to which the Perijá tapaculo belongs, has an abundance of similar species, {{many of which are}} difficult to classify through appearance. <b>Some</b> <b>individual</b> species from other genera are like Scytalopus in size and plumage, but have different behaviour and morphological features. Vocal studies and mitochondrial DNA analysis are often used to differentiate between species within the genus; a number of visually identical species previously classified as subspecies of the Magellanic tapaculo (S. magellanicus) have been identified through these methods, and the majority of subspecies within the genus have subsequently been reclassified as separate species.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} Black Hebrews arrived in Israel in 1969, they claimed {{citizenship}} under the Law of Return, which gives eligible Jews immediate citizenship. The Israeli government ruled in 1973 {{that the group}} did not qualify for automatic citizenship {{because they could not}} prove Jewish descent and had not undergone Orthodox conversion. The Black Hebrews were denied work permits and state benefits. The group accused the Israeli government of racist discrimination. In 1981, a group of American civil rights activists led by Bayard Rustin investigated and concluded that racism was not the cause of the Black Hebrews' situation. No official action was taken to return the Black Hebrews to the United States, but <b>some</b> <b>individual</b> members were deported for working illegally.|$|E
