5|$|While totally {{dominating}} the region's production, <b>sparkling</b> Champagne {{is not the}} only product that is made from the region's grapes. Non-sparkling still wines, like those made around the village Bouzy, are sold under the appellation label Coteaux Champenois. There is also a rosé appellation in the region, Rosé des Riceys. The regional vin de liqueur is called Ratafia de Champagne. Since the profit of making <b>sparkling</b> Champagne from the region's grape is now much higher, production of these non-sparkling wines and fortified wines is very small.|$|E

5|$|The war {{of words}} would {{continue}} for another 130 years with endless commentary from doctors, poets, playwrights and authors all arguing for their favorite region and their polemics being reproduced in advertisements for Burgundy and Champagne. On a few occasions, the two regions were {{on the brink of}} civil war. A turning point occurred when several Champagne wine makers abandoned efforts to produce red wine in favor of focusing on harnessing the effervescent nature of <b>sparkling</b> Champagne. As the bubbles became more popular, doctors throughout France and Europe commented on the health benefits of the <b>sparkling</b> bubbles which were said to cure malaria. As more Champenois winemakers embarked on this new and completely different wine style, the rivalry with Burgundy mellowed and eventually waned.|$|E
5000|$|Dee, <b>Sparkle</b> and a visibly high Sister rehearse for a {{performance}} at Satin and Sister's home, until Satin {{comes into the room}} and interrupts wanting Dee and <b>Sparkle</b> to leave.

5|$|The Champagne {{province}} {{is located}} near the northern limits of the wine world along the 49th parallel. The high altitude and mean annual temperature of 10°C (50°F) creates a difficult environment for wine grapes to fully ripen. Ripening is aided {{by the presence of}} forests which helps to stabilize temperatures and maintain moisture in the soil. The cool temperatures serve to produce high levels of acidity in the resulting grape which is ideal for <b>sparkling</b> wine.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} chess tournament was {{organized}} by Howard Staunton, a leading English chess player, and was held in London in 1851. It was won by the German Adolf Anderssen, who was hailed as the leading chess master. His brilliant, energetic attacking style was typical for the time. <b>Sparkling</b> games like Anderssen's Immortal game and Evergreen game or Morphy's Opera game were regarded as the highest possible summit of the chess art.|$|E
50|$|One {{day after}} church Stix tries to {{convince}} Dee and Sister {{to form a}} music group with <b>Sparkle</b> and <b>Sparkle</b> becomes angry feeling that Stix has used her to speak with Dee and Sister about his plan. Dee explains that she will take part {{in order to make}} enough money for medical school, then will quit, while Sister is undecided as she will be starting a new job working at a department store. While at Emma's boutique, Ms. Waters shows <b>Sparkle</b> old photos of Emma with <b>Sparkle's</b> father and photos of Emma with Dee's father, explaining how different Emma was when she was with <b>Sparkle</b> and Sister's father. <b>Sparkle</b> leaves and goes to a record store where she sees Stix again. The two make up.|$|R
50|$|As Sister and <b>Sparkle</b> arrive home, {{their sister}} Delores/Dee (Tika Sumpter) {{opens the door}} and they sneak upstairs to their room to avoid having their mother hear them come in. Emma (Whitney Houston), the girls' mother, walks into the girls' room and notices <b>Sparkle,</b> Sister and Dee in bed together, and demands that Sister and <b>Sparkle</b> prepare for bed and be ready for church in the morning. The next morning while at church Stix along with his cousin Levi (Omari Hardwick) spot Sister and <b>Sparkle</b> sitting in the choir. Stix tells Levi that Sister and <b>Sparkle</b> are {{siblings}} with musical talent, and Levi is interested in meeting Sister. After church Stix and <b>Sparkle</b> meet and talk for a while, as Emma notices and looks on disapprovingly. Ms. Waters (Tamela Mann) Emma's friend points out that Emma's oldest daughter Sister is almost 30, and due to a bad situation in New York City was forced to move back to Detroit to live with Emma. Later that night Emma hosts a Bible study at her home in which both Levi and Stix are present, however Levi takes the time to make a date with Sister who is uninterested and not participating in her mother's Bible study. After Emma and everyone leave the house, Stix secretly stays behind and notices <b>Sparkle</b> playing an original song that she wrote on a piano. Stix tries to encourage <b>Sparkle</b> to sing. A few nights later Stix comes to <b>Sparkle's</b> home to take her on a date at a nightclub.

40|$|For {{suitable}} illumination {{and observation}} conditions, <b>sparkles</b> may {{be observed in}} metallic coatings. The visibility of these <b>sparkles</b> depends critically on their intensity, and on the paint medium surrounding the metallic flakes. Based on previous perception studies from other disciplines, we derive equations for the threshold for <b>sparkles</b> to be visible. The resulting equations show how the visibility of <b>sparkles</b> varies with the luminosity and distance of the light source, {{the diameter of the}} metallic flakes, and the reflection properties of the paint medium. The pre-dictions are confirmed by common observations on metallic <b>sparkle.</b> For example, under appropriate conditions even metallic flakes as small as 1 μm diameter may be visible as <b>sparkle,</b> whereas under intense spot light the finer grades of metallic coatings do not show <b>sparkle.</b> We show that in direct sunlight, dark coarse metallic coatings show <b>sparkles</b> that are brighter than the brightest stars and planets in the night sky. Finally, we give equations to predict the number of visually distinguishable flake intensities, depending on local conditions. These equations are confirmed by previous results. Several practical examples for applying the equations derived in this article ar...|$|R
5|$|The most {{frequently}} encountered bioluminescent organisms {{may be the}} dinoflagellates present in the surface layers of the sea, which {{are responsible for the}} <b>sparkling</b> phosphorescence sometimes seen at night in disturbed water. At least eighteen genera exhibit luminosity. A different effect is the thousands of square miles of the ocean which shine with the light produced by bioluminescent bacteria, known as mareel or the milky seas effect.|$|E
5|$|The winery {{had been}} founded by both {{his father and}} his {{grandfather}}, Hermann Schnaufer, in 1919, shortly after World War I. Following the death of his grandfather in 1928 the winery was run by his father alone. When his father unexpectedly died in 1940, his mother ran the business until the children took over the winery after World War II. The company then expanded the business and in addition to the winery offered wine imports, <b>sparkling</b> wines, and a distillery for wine and liqueur. The distribution channel worked with agents and sales offices throughout Germany.|$|E
5|$|Counter-illumination means {{producing}} {{light to}} match a background that is brighter than an animal's body or military vehicle; it {{is a form}} of active camouflage. It is notably used by some species of squid, such as the firefly squid and the midwater squid. The latter has light-producing organs (photophores) scattered all over its underside; these create a <b>sparkling</b> glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below. Counterillumination camouflage is the likely function of the bioluminescence of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract or to detect prey and for signalling.|$|E

5|$|Counter-illumination through {{bioluminescence}} on {{the underside}} (ventral region) {{of the body is}} found in many species that live in the open ocean down to about 1000 metres. The generated light increases an animal's brightness when seen from below to match the brightness of the ocean surface; it is an effective form of active camouflage. It is notably used by some species of squid, such as the midwater squid, Abralia veranyi. These have light-producing organs (photophores) scattered all over their undersides, creating a <b>sparkling</b> glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below. Counter-illumination camouflage is the likely function of the bioluminescence of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract or to detect prey and for signalling.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, Cubzac {{served as}} a watchtower through the Four Sons of Amon castle. Different means of {{crossing}} the river in Cubzac have historically been used, from pontoon bridges and horse-powered ferries to steel and concrete bridges. Part of a vibrant wine region, Cubzac has several wine castles, including the Terrefort castle. It has developed its own <b>sparkling</b> wine, {{in what is now}} called the Café de Paris. The limestone quarries of Cubzac supplied for the typical white constructions found in Bordeaux and its region. Cubzac has two Monuments Historiques; the first is a painting in a church, the other is the ruins of the Four Sons of Amon castle.|$|E
5|$|During {{the eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries, the mound of Cubzac was slashed all around to provide stone for Bordeaux's {{construction}} and the ballast of some river banks, creating deep excavations in the limestone. In 1898, André Cousteau, uncle of the researcher and ecologist Jacques Cousteau, started using the caves to make a <b>sparkling</b> wine based on traditional Champagne-making techniques. The wine, treated in a closed tank, bottled, and kept neck down many months at constant temperature, became bubbly and had its impurities accumulate near the cap. Once this deposit was removed, the bottles were resealed by force, and the corks muzzled. In 1920, the Cousteau property was sold to the Société Anonyme Gay-Mousse. In 1966, the caves where entrusted to Monsieur Lateyron who, one year later, created the Café de Paris.|$|E
5000|$|Ross, Inc. {{operated}} {{in a factory}} in Chanute, Kansas. The company produced several models of guitar amplifiers, bass amplifiers, organ amplifiers, Guitars, Basses, and keyboards and P.A. systems.
