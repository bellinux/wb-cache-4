40|$|Summary: The Boehringer Mannheim Hitachi 911 is a <b>selective</b> <b>analyzer</b> for 35 {{different}} methods including 3 ion-selective electrode (ISE) methods. We have evaluated this analyzer primarily to obtain objective information on its applicability for routine urine analyses in our laboratory. We also implemented appropriate assays for various special serum- and whole blood-tests, some {{for the first}} time on the Hitachi 911 and some with modified settings. Analytical evaluation involved NCCLS EP 5 -T 2 (imprecision), NCCLS EP 6 -P (linearity), Krouwer 27 (multifactor) and Passing & Bablok (method comparison) evaluation protocols. With the exception of evidence of systematic erroneous sample predilution, overall results were favourable. Practicability of the Hitachi 911 was judged by simulating daily routine. During a period of two weeks, daily urine samples were rerun on the Hitachi 911, leading to a gain of about 50 % in total processing time. It was concluded that the Hitachi 911 meets the requirements in terms of analytical performance, reliability, versatility and speed for an analyzer to be used in a routine (urine) setting, while having a distinct role in special (serum/whole blood) measurements...|$|E
40|$|Summary: A new enzymatic {{method for}} the {{determination}} of bilirubin in serum and plasma {{by means of a}} Hitachi 704 <b>selective</b> <b>analyzer</b> was evaluated. This endpoint method (37 °C) including a sample blank showed very reliable results. The range of linearity was 0. 3 to 437 μιηοΐ/ΐ bilirubin. The within-run imprecision of three different bilirubin concentrations (n = 16) was 0. 37, 0. 44 and 0. 76 % (coefficient of variation). Between-assay imprecision (n = 15) was 0. 51 to 1. 76 % (coefficient of variation) for five different control materials. Inaccuracy, determined with 5 control sera (assigned values: 19, 23. 9, 90. 7, 142. 0 and 295. 6 μιηοΐ/ΐ bilirubin), was 0. 14 to 4. 27 %. Recovery rates, determined in two spiked plasma samples, were 97. 8 % and 99. 1 %, and in six bilirubin standard solutions between 92 and 99 %.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a sensitive and <b>selective</b> semi-continuous <b>analyzer</b> (FORMAL-FLU) for the fluorimetric determination of atmospheric formaldehyde. The method {{is based on}} the reaction between formaldehyde and Fluoral-P, producing the fluorescent derivative 3, 5 -diacetyl- 1, 4 -dihydrolutidine (DDL) which, when excited at 410 nm, fluoresces at 510 nm. This analyzer consists of a gas diffusion chamber with a central microporous Teflon tube, with high gas permeability, filled with Fluoral-P solution. The air sample is pumped continually along the external tube and formaldehyde permeates the internal tube membrane, where it reacts selectively with Fluoral-P to form DDL. The analytical parameters of air sampling flow rate, sampling time interval and Fluoral-P reagent flow rate were optimized by the response surface method, using the Box-Behnken design. Under optimal conditions, air samples were pumped through the annular space of a gas diffusion chamber equipped with a central tube of microporous Teflon (17 cm long, 1. 4 mm i. d., 2. 15 mm e. d., 70 % of porosity and 2 µm average pore diameter) filled with Fluoral-P at 2. 5 mL min- 1 for 30 min. After sampling, the mixture was directed at 1. 3 mL min- 1 to a 2. 0 m long reaction coil immerged in a thermostatic bath at 80 ºC to improve the sample/reagent mixture and reaction rate, then to the fluorimetric detector (&# 955;ex = 410 nm &# 955;em = 510 nm), where the signal was acquired and recorded by an integrator. Peak heights were measured and these values were used in the calibration and determination steps. Under these conditions, the limit of detection was 0. 55 ng mL- 1 and the coefficient of variation was 8. 6 %. The main advantage of the FORMAL-FLU system is its selectivity for formaldehyde, without significant interference from bisulfite and other aldehydes, especially acetaldehyde, low blank level, resulting in low detection limits and, above all, using a single sampling and measuring device equipment which allows for in situ measurements...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the correlation between}} insulin resistance(IR) and coronary artery disease in patients with normal glucose tolerance. Methods One hundred and twenty-nine patients with normal glucose tolerance,who visited Zhejiang Hospital from January 2007 to December 2010,were enrolled {{in the present study}} and were divided into two groups according to homeostatic model assessment(HOMA) of insulin sensitivity index(ISI) : insulin sensitive group(IS,n= 68) and IR group(n= 61). The total cholesterol(TC),triglyceride(TG),low-density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-C),high-density lipoprotein cholesterol(HDL-C), homocysteine(HCY), and uric acid(UA) were measured for each patient using an auto biochemistry <b>analyzer.</b> <b>Selective</b> coronary angiography and Gensini score were performed on all the patients. Spearman’s correlations and stepwise multiple regression analysis were used in the data analysis. Results The coronary artery lesions were more severe in the IR group than in the IS group. The percentages of normal and one-vessel disease were significantly lower in the IR group(both 11. 8 %) than in the IS group(29. 8 % and 26. 3 %,respectively,P < 0. 05). The percentage of multi-vessel disease and Gensini score were significantly higher in the IR group(49. 0 % and 32. 2 ± 34. 3,respectively) than in the IS group(14. 1 % and 10. 6 ± 12. 7,respectively,P < 0. 01). A negative correlation was identified through partial correlation analysis between the Gensini score and ISI(r=- 0. 354,P < 0. 01) after adjusting for influential factors. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that ISI and HCY are the independent factors for the Gensini score. Conclusion Insulin resistance is closely correlated with the severity of coronary artery lesions,and is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease in patients with normal glucose tolerance...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Lithium (Li) is a {{well-established}} drug {{for the treatment}} of bipolar affective disorders. Li as a drug is known to possess a narrow therapeutic index. Thus, regular monitoring of blood Li in patients receiving Li therapy is essential. Plain tubes with clot activator are known to interfere with Li estimation. The current study was planned to compare Li estimation in sera from vacutainers with clot activator, and plasma from sodium heparinized vacutainers with that of Li estimation in sera from glass vials. The time-dependant stability of Li estimation on storage at 2 °C– 8 °C for 48 h in these three set of tubes was also evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood from the patients on Li therapy (n = 100) was collected in 3 different collection tubes: plain vacutainer with clot activator (S), Sodium heparinized vacutainer (P) and Glass vial (G) and was analyzed by ion <b>selective</b> electrode (ISE) <b>analyzer</b> for Li levels. Secondary aliquots were also taken from each type of collection tube and stored at 2 °C– 8 °C. Time-dependant stability of Li estimation was checked at 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h. ANOVA followed by Tukey's posttest was performed to calculate statistical significance taking glass vial as reference collection tube. Bland–Altman plots were plotted to compare between three collection tubes at baseline. Stability on storage was defined when > 95 % of the samples were within allowable error limit for that time point taking baseline levels as reference. RESULTS: A mean bias of 0. 18 mmol/L and mean percentage bias of 19. 9 % in Li levels was observed between serum from (S) than serum from (G). This difference was found to be statistically significant. However, statistically nonsignificant mean bias of 0. 02 mmol/L and mean percentage bias of 3. 34 % in Li levels was observed between plasma from (P) and serum from (G). Time-dependant stability was observed more in glass vials as compared to vacutainers with clot activator or sodium heparin. CONCLUSION: Serum from glass vial should be the preferred method for blood collection to determine Li levels...|$|R
