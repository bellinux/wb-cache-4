40|$|With {{the mining}} {{industry}} moving from traditional manual methods to the advanced mechanised mining, {{the focus is}} also shifting to the energy efficiency of the equipment and system being employed. Most of the equipment used in mining like <b>shovel,</b> <b>drill,</b> elevator, continues miner, conveyor, pumps etc. runs on electricity. Electric energy being the only form of energy which can be easily converted to any other form plays a vital role {{for the growth of}} any industry. The Power Factor gives an idea about the efficiency of the system to do useful work out of the supplied electric power. A low value of power factor leads to increase is electric losses and also draws penalty by the utility. Significant savings in utility power costs can be realized by keeping up an average monthly power factor close to unity. The work carried out is concerned with developing power factor correction equipment based on embedded system which can automatically monitor the power factor in the mining electrical system {{and take care of the}} switching process to maintain a desired level of power factor which fulfils the standard norms. The Automatic Power Factor Correction (APFC) device developed is based on embedded system having 89 S 52 microcontroller at its core. The voltage and current signal from the system is sampled and taken as input to measure the power factor and if it falls short of the specified value by utility, then the device automatically switch on the capacitor banks to compensate for the reactive power. After employing the correction equipment the targeted power factor of 0. 95 is achieved and the increase in power factor varied from 9 % to 19 % based on the combination of load. There is also a decrease of 1. 7 % in the total energy consumption due to reduction in load current. The economic analysis for power factor improvement considering the data from a local coal mine suggested the payback period to be around 9 months if the correction equipment is implemente...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} century, open pit mines have {{steadily}} increased their production rate by using larger equipments which require intensive capital investment. Low commodity prices have forced companies to decrease their unit cost by improving productivity. One {{way to improve}} productivity is to utilize equipment as effectively as possible.

50|$|A {{line was}} built from Muswellbrook to Denman in 1915 and then {{extended}} to Sandy Hollow and Merriwa in 1917. The section between Sandy Hollow and Merriwa {{has been closed}} since 1988. The Sandy Hollow Line between Sandy Hollow, Gulgong and Maryvale, (between Wellington and Dubbo), was originally surveyed in 1860 as a more easily graded crossing of the Great Dividing Range than the Blue Mountains line nearer to Sydney. It was not commenced, however, until 1937, when it began as an unemployment relief scheme of the NSW Government, achieving infamy for having no modern mechanical devices used on it, other than trucks carrying concrete for the tunnels and bridge piers, all other work being done with picks, <b>shovels,</b> hand <b>drills,</b> horses and carts. Construction continued through World War 2 at a desultory pace, held up by money, labour and especially steel shortages, only to be abandoned unfinished, approximately 92% complete, {{a few years later}} in 1951.

60|$|For {{three days}} they toiled with pick and <b>shovel</b> and clinking <b>drill,</b> and {{the roar of}} the {{blasting}} charges shook the wet hillside, but while the trenches deepened slowly the water rose. By night the big fires snapped and sputtered, and the feeble lanterns blinked through the rain, while wild figures, stained with mire and dripping water, moved amidst the smoke, and those who dragged themselves out of the workings lay down on the wet ground for a brief hour's sleep. Brooke, however, so far as he could afterwards remember, did not close his eyes at all, and where his dripping figure appeared the shovels swung more rapidly, and the ringing of the drills grew a trifle louder. The pace was, however, too fierce to last, and, though even the men who work for another toil strenuously in that land, it was evident to him that while their task was less than half-done, they could not sustain it long.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{approaches to}} evaluate the health of mining machinery, based on monitored vibration data. The objective {{was to develop a}} means to determine machine health, while operating on-line, without reference to an expert. This approach is based on processing acquired vibration data with artificial neural networks (ANN's). A case study, based on data obtained from the monitoring of locomotives at the Iron Ore Company (IOCC). Real time data patterns, profiles and trends, obtained by processing vibration signals from various points on locomotives, were used to test the developed technique. The results indicate that observed patterns and trends can be classified into categories that reliably indicate the mechanical state of the equipment. An implemented system will assist maintenance personnel at this mine to identify the trends of a developing component problem in advance of catastrophic failure. In addition the system will be able to predict its remaining life prior to catastrophic failure. Thus, a machine could be reliably and safely operated until just prior to failure of a component. The thesis work is a sub-component of a larger project at IOCC, to implement a mine-wide predictive/preventative maintenance program for pumps, locomotives, trucks, <b>shovels</b> and <b>drills</b> at their open-pit mine in Labrador City, Newfoundland. This system will use intermittent on- and off-line, condition monitoring based on ANNs and expert systems (ES). A functional overview is discussed. The data would identify where and what is the particular machine alarm condition. Such an approach would allow improved fault detection of machine components, especially in mines where trained personnel are not readily available. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

Natural Resources Research Institute, 5013 Miller Trunk Highway, Duluth MN 55811 - 1442 Taconite {{aggregates}} (collectively termed Mesabi Hard Rock™) {{have been}} used as construction aggregate in Minnesota for nearly 50 years, dating back to {{the early days of the}} taconite industry. Coarse taconite tailings are a ready-made, free-draining, fine aggregate equivalent suitable for use as select granular and fine filter aggregates. Their angular interlocking form, when placed with water and covered with Class 5, produces sound embankment fill material. Their hardness, strength and durability produce superior wear and friction properties in bituminous mixes. This, coupled with 100 % fractured faces, makes them ideal for Superpave mixes. Their cleanness (very low - 200 mesh) makes them a valuable tool for adjusting volumetric properties in bituminous mix design. Crushed taconite rock brings the same hardness, strength and durability to the coarser aggregate size fractions, making it ideal for crushing to desired specifications for use as fill, filter material and the coarse aggregate component in bituminous and concrete mixes. Historically, taconite aggregate products {{have been used}} most when road construction, maintenance, and repair projects are in close proximity to the taconite operations, i. e., on the Mesabi Range. The 1970 s and 1980 s saw the use of coarse taconite tailings spread to the Twin Cities metropolitan area, as well as to the southern and western reaches of the state for use in bituminous overlays and surfacing. The 1990 s and 2000 s saw taconite aggregates become a staple of Duluth area bituminous contractors and road constructors, to the degree that they are used in some capacity in nearly every project. Millions of tons of taconite byproducts are produced every year in the mining and pellet production process. Couple this with nearly 50 years of production and the enormous size of this resource becomes obvious. While much of this material is consumed by the taconite mines for day to day operations (haul roads, tailings dams, <b>shovel</b> pads, <b>drill</b> hole stemming, etc.), much remains stockpiled and available for use. Infrastructure already in place for shipment of pellets (roads, railroads, and Lake Superior docks and ship-loading facilities) can be accessed for shipment of aggregates throughout the United States and beyond. This report is a historical narrative of the highlights of taconite aggregate usage as road construction aggregates in Minnesota. It documents how taconite byproducts have evolved from stockpiled "wastes" to become premium "in-demand" aggregates suitable for meeting today's infrastructure needs.

40|$|In {{the mining}} industry, it is {{observed}} that sudden break-down of any equipment may stop the entire system, resulting in drastic production losses and enhancing the cost production. In this paper, the probability of sudden break down of each equipment are individually analyzed from their previous performances where the frequency of occurrences, duration and the time-interval of each breakdown has given an additional stress and the non-availability of that equipment on the entire system is discussed. Computerized best fit matching is found out for preventive maintenance of this equipment by developing different sub-routines and simulation models. Optimum utilization of those equipment shows a particular steady- state production from the mine. Advanced technology is used for the operation of the open-pit mining. Hazard due to open cast mining is less than that of underground mines and the recent trend is to adopt the former one. For the mechanization, different types of machineries are used, such as <b>shovel,</b> dumper, dozer, <b>drill</b> machines, etc. use of more machineries increases the complexity of the operation and as a result {{it is very difficult to}} the proper matching of these equipment’s. As these machineries are very costly so unless they are properly matched, reduction in production cost is not possible. Sudden breakdown of one equipment may stop the production from whole mine. So it is needed to analyze the breakdown data by statistical approach to find out the possibility of breakdown of that particular equipment and ask for preventive maintenance. This analysis needed the help of computer for simulating the whole mining system to judge the performance of each equipment. This paper deals with the computerized best fit matching, for preventive maintenance of equipment. ...|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. At {{the very}} roots of this {{dissertation}} lies a commercial process with many as yet unexplored characteristics {{that will be}} thoroughly examined, using a rich variety of statistical methods and techniques. Broadly speaking, the main objective of this study involves the development of techniques to control the quality of advanced explosives detonators used in commercial mining operations. To accomplish this task, various statistical characteristics of this detonation process are described and examined {{in order to obtain}} a holistic understanding of the underlying process. The parameters of the process are introduced and estimates for unknowns are derived. Real-time quality control techniques based on these results are suggested. 1. 2. The role of blasting in mining A major part of South Africa's economy is based on the mining of the rich mineral deposits that {{are to be found in}} the country. These mining operations are carried out both above ground (open-pit iron ore mines, for example) and below ground (gold, uranium and others). Open-pit mining, in particular, requires significant amounts of commercial blasting to dislodge the high volumes of material that have to be moved and processed. An average blasting block at Iscor's Sishen mine, for example, contains about 250 000 tons of material, although a world record was established in April 1981 when 7, 2 million tons of rock was broken during a single blast. The chemical quality of the final products is partly controlled by supplying the primary crusher at the mine with a suitable mixture of so-called run-of-mine ore. To determine which material from a specific blasting block may be sent to the plant, and to which waste dump the remaining material should be assigned, factors such as beneficiation properties of the raw material and the content of various by-products are considered. Samples are typically taken from alternate blast holes for every metre drilled. Each drill sample is divided into two parts by means of a riffler for a washed and unwashed sample. The washed samples are examined and the rock types noted. Subsequently, all the samples are grouped and analysed chemically and the densities of the different rock types are determined. The results are processed and those for the washed and unwashed samples correlated. The blasting blocks in the pit are demarcated by means of whitewash lines, according to the divisions on the blasting-block plans, and they are marked with signs to guide <b>shovel</b> operators. Primary <b>drilling</b> is performed by means of electrically-driven rotary drills. At the Sishen mine, 310 mm diameter blast holes are drilled in all rock types. The following table depicts typical drilling 2 patterns for various rock types: Rock type Pattern (m) Drill depth (m) Hard iron ore 2 x 8, 3 3, 0 Medium-hard iron ore 1 x 9, 3 2, 7 Quartzite 8, 2 x 9, 4 2, 5 Flagstone 8, 2 x 9, 4 5 Calcrete 8, 1 x 9, 3 0 Primary blasting is done at Sishen with Heavy Anfo, an explosive that is manufactured by mine personnel at the emulsion plant on site. The ingredients for the explosive blends are transported by pump trucks to the blasting blocks, where it is mixed and pumped down the blast holes. Good fragmentation of the blasted material is a prerequisite for high loading rates by the loading equipment. At Sishen and other similar mines, a blasting efficiency of 3, 2 tons of rock per kilogram of explosives used, is considered to be acceptable...|$|R
40|$|In 2001, the Catholic University of Chile {{undertook}} a maintenance benchmarking study of six open pit copper mines having mill capacities varying between 18, 000 t/d and 156, 000 t/d, and collectively responsible for 58 % of Chilean copper production. Key performance indices {{were selected to}} measure the effectiveness, efficiency, {{and development of the}} maintenance process. Key effectiveness indices used in the mining industry are equipment availability, reliability, and maintainability and safety indices. Reliability is often measured by mean time between failures (MTBF) and maintainability as the mean time to repair or restore service (MTTR). At the time of undertaking the benchmarking study (2001), only two of the six participating mines routinely measured these parameters. For this reason, the study focused on comparing fleet availabilities. Accident rate and accident severity (expressed as the number of lost time incidents and lost time hours per million man hours, respectively) were solicited for all permanent and contracted maintenance personnel. Financial data provided by the participating companies included total annual maintenance and mining costs, as well as a breakdown of labour, materials, and contractor costs. This data, when combined with ore and waste production data, enabled the unit costs of maintenance to be calculated. Internal efficiency indicators were solicited for: * the percentage of planned maintenance (preventive, predictive, and programmed major component replacement) carried out on each equipment fleet (blasthole drills, hydraulic and cable shovels, wheel loaders, haul trucks, and auxiliary equipment); * scheduled maintenance compliance (actual planned hours versus scheduled planned hours); * organizational efficiency in terms of the ratio of supervisors to maintenance technicians; * investment in maintenance planning as evident from the ratio of planners to maintenance technicians (planning clerks and statisticians were also considered to be maintenance planners); and * efficiency in inventory practices as evident from the stores turnover ratio and service level. Development indices were solicited for the educational level of maintenance employees and the level of commitment to maintenance training by both the companies and their collaborators, in terms of annual training hours and investment per employee. The principal conclusions of the study were as follows: * For the six open pit mines that participated in the study, maintenance costs were found to average 44 % of mining costs. This highlights the importance of the direct cost of maintenance to the financial performance of mines. * Percentage planned maintenance of equipment fleets were low by world standards, averaging 35 %, 56 %, and 44 %, respectively, for blasthole <b>drill,</b> <b>shovel,</b> and haul truck fleets. * Fleet availabilities were significantly influenced by the percentage of planned maintenance achieved. For example, haul truck fleet availabilities were found to increase on average by 1 % for every 4 % increase in planned maintenance over the range examined. * Maintenance cost per equipment was found to decrease non-linearly with increases in percentage planned maintenance. An empirical relationship was determined {{that can be used to}} estimate potential cost savings as a result of improved planned maintenance practices (see figure). * The ratio of maintenance planning staff to maintenance technicians varied between 1 : 10 and 1 : 24, indicating improvement opportunities for some of the participating companies. Investment in technical training (including planned maintenance practice) was found to be low by global industry standards. It was concluded that fleet availability and maintenance costs in Chilean open pit operations could be considerably improved by improving and/or developing maintenance planning standards, and training personnel in planned maintenance technique...|$|R
