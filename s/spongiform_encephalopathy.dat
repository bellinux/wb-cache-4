5|$|Many {{different}} mammalian {{species can}} be affected by prion diseases, as the prion protein (PrP) is very similar in all mammals. Due to small differences in PrP between different species it is unusual for a prion disease to transmit from one species to another. The human prion disease variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, however, {{is believed to be}} caused by a prion that typically infects cattle, causing Bovine <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> and is transmitted through infected meat.|$|E
5|$|The episode's script {{went through}} several {{different}} versions before a final plot was decided upon, as Morgan and Wong believed the series {{would not be}} renewed for a third season and wished to write a suitable ending. The decision to kill off the character of Catherine Black {{was based on a}} suggestion by Chris Carter, the series' creator. Morgan and Wong discussed the idea with actress Megan Gallagher, who felt that it was an interesting decision to have Catherine give her life after seeing Frank Black sacrifice so much for their family throughout the previous episodes. The idea of depicting an apocalyptic scenario as being the result of a virus came from Morgan's research into possible end-of-the-world scenarios, and was influenced by the outbreak of bovine <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> in the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Bovine <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (BSE), {{commonly}} known as mad cow disease, is a transmissible <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> and fatal neurodegenerative disease in cattle that may be passed to humans who have eaten infected flesh. BSE causes a spongiform degeneration {{of the brain and}} spinal cord. BSE has a long incubation period, of 2.5 to 5 years, usually affecting adult cattle at a peak age onset of four to five years. BSE is caused by a misfolded protein—a prion. In the United Kingdom, more than 180,000 cattle were infected and 4.4 million slaughtered during the eradication program. In France, the country worst affected overall, over 300,000 cases were identified, although most were not recorded at the time.|$|E

25|$|These {{researchers}} {{noticed a}} genetic variation in some kuru patients {{that has been}} known to promote long incubation periods. They have also proposed that individuals having contracted CJD in the early 1990s represent a distinct genetic subpopulation, with unusually short incubation periods for bovine <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (BSE). This means that there may be many more vCJD patients with longer incubation periods, which may surface many years later.|$|E
25|$|Due to bovine <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (BSE) in the European beef industry, {{the use of}} animal-derived {{products}} to feed cattle is now severely restricted.

40|$|The {{transmissible}} <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> are {{a heterogeneous}} group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders occurring in humans, mink, cats, and ruminant herbivores. The occurrence of novel transmissible <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> in cattle in the United Kingdom and Europe and in mule deer and elk {{in parts of}} the United States has emphasized the need for reliable diagnostic tests with standardized reagents. Postmortem diagnosis is performed by histologic examination of brain sections from affected animals. The histopathological criteria for transmissible <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> include gliosis, astrocytosis, neuronal degeneration, and spongiform change. These lesions vary in intensity and anatomic location depending on the host species and genetics, stage of disease, and infectious agent source. Diagnosis by histopathology alone may be ambiguous in hosts with early cases of disease and impossible if the tissue is autolyzed. Deposition of the prion protein (an abnormal isoform of a native cellular sialoglycoprotein) in the central nervous system is a reliable marker for infection, and immunohistochemical detection of this marker is a useful adjunct to histopathology. In the present paper we describe monoclonal antibody (MAb) F 89 / 160. 1. 5, which reacts with prion protein in tissues from sheep, cattle, mule deer, and elk with naturally occurring transmissible <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies.</b> This MAb recognizes a conserved epitope on the prion protein in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections after hydrated autoclaving. MAb F 89 / 160. 1. 5 will be useful in diagnostic and pathogenesis studies of the transmissible <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> in these ruminant species...|$|R
25|$|The delay between {{consumption}} of a contaminated food and {{appearance of the}} first symptoms of illness is called the incubation period. This ranges from hours to days (and rarely months or even years, {{such as in the}} case of listeriosis or bovine <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy),</b> depending on the agent, and on how much was consumed. If symptoms occur within one to six hours after eating the food, it suggests that it is caused by a bacterial toxin or a chemical rather than live bacteria.|$|E
25|$|In August 1999 beef from a St Merryn {{slaughterhouse}} {{made the}} national news {{when it was}} the source of the first beef from the British mainland to be served in Brussels in 3 years.

25|$|Other safety {{concerns}} about vaccines {{have been published}} on the Internet, in informal meetings, in books, and at symposia. These include hypotheses that vaccination can cause sudden infant death syndrome, epileptic seizures, allergies, multiple sclerosis, and autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, as well as hypotheses that vaccinations can transmit bovine <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy,</b> hepatitis C virus, and HIV. These hypotheses have been investigated, with the conclusion that currently used vaccines meet high safety standards and that criticism of vaccine safety in the popular press is not justified. Large well-controlled epidemiologic {{studies have been conducted}} and the results do not support the hypothesis that vaccines cause chronic diseases. Furthermore, some vaccines are probably more likely to prevent or modify than cause or exacerbate autoimmune diseases.|$|E

25|$|In July 2008, Kamloops MLA Claude Richmond {{announced}} he would not seek re-election in the May 2009 provincial election. Consequently, Lake {{announced that he would}} not stand for re-election as mayor but would instead seek to replace Richmond. With MLA Kevin Krueger moving to the new Kamloops-South Thompson riding, Lake was unopposed for BC Liberal nomination in the Kamloops-North Thompson. The election was expected to be close but Lake ultimately defeated the NDP candidate Doug Brown, student April Snowe for the Green Party, Clearwater resident Wayne Russell of the Refederation Party, and the Work Less Party's Keston Broughton. Lake's BC Liberals won the election and formed a majority government under Premier Gordon Campbell. In the first two sessions of the 39th Parliament Lake was appointed to the Select Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and the Select Standing Committee on Health, however neither of those committees held any meetings. Premier Campbell did not include Lake in the cabinet but he was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary for the Ranching Task Force under the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands. The Ranching Task Force began its work in July to review the province's role in the ranching industry, an industry which had been facing setbacks such as declining cattle prices and fewer exports following a Bovine <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> outbreak and a strengthen currency value (relative to the US dollar).
