5|$|Although most residences {{were built}} {{according}} to local vernacular traditions, some manors (such as Austråt and Rosendal) exhibit the influence of Baroque architecture. Only the city of Christiania (Oslo) had a building code that prohibited wooden houses, {{and a number of}} large town houses modeled after Continental building types were constructed. <b>Some</b> <b>large</b> churches were constructed with brick walls, notably in Bergen, Christiania, Røros and Kongsberg.|$|E
5|$|CMVs are {{required}} to pass through weigh stations at the borders of most states and <b>some</b> <b>large</b> cities. These weigh stations are run by state DOTs, and CMV weight and size enforcement is overseen by the FHWA. Weigh stations check each vehicle's gross weight and axle weight using a set of in-ground truck scales, and are usually where a truck's compliance with the formula is checked.|$|E
5|$|Jellyfish stings killed about 1,500 {{people in}} the 20th century, and cubozoans are {{particularly}} dangerous. On the other hand, <b>some</b> <b>large</b> jellyfish are considered a delicacy in East and Southeast Asia. Coral reefs have long been economically important as providers of fishing grounds, protectors of shore buildings against currents and tides, and more recently as centers of tourism. However, they are vulnerable to over-fishing, mining for construction materials, pollution, and damage caused by tourism.|$|E

On 1 March 1986, the district of 24 Parganas was bifurcated into two districts—the North 24 Parganas district and the South 24 Parganas district. On 1 April 1992, the West Dinajpur district was bifurcated into the Uttar Dinajpur district and the Dakshin Dinajpur district. On 1 January 2002, the erstwhile Midnapore district was bifurcated into the Purba Medinipur district and the Paschim Medinipur district.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>large</b> {{satellites}} are {{of similar}} size or {{larger than the}} planet Mercury, e.g. Jupiter's Galilean moons and Titan. Alan Stern has argued that location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes {{should be taken into}} account in the definition of a planet, and proposes the term satellite planet for a planet-sized satellite. Likewise, dwarf planets in the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt should be considered planets according to Stern.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>large</b> {{woodpeckers}} such as Dryocopus have a fast, direct form of flight, but {{the majority}} of species have a typical undulating flight pattern consisting of a series of rapid flaps followed by a swooping glide.

5|$|After Icos's {{experimental}} drugs {{failed in}} clinical trials, Eli Lilly {{was in a}} prime position to purchase the company. In October2006, Eli Lilly announced that it had reached terms to acquire Icos for $2.1billion, or $32 a share. After receiving pressure from large institutional shareholders as well as proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) suggesting the deal should be rejected, Lilly increased its offer to $2.3billion or $34 per share, a 6% increase. Again, resistance was voiced by <b>some</b> <b>large</b> shareholders, and ISS advised shareholders against accepting the new offer, which it still deemed insufficient. On January 25, 2007, at a special meeting, 77% of the shareholders voted {{in support of the}} acquisition. Eli Lilly closed the transaction to acquire Icos for $2.3billion on January29, 2007.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2010, Sélestat had 1,823 businesses, most of them (1,240) in the {{tertiary}} sector. A {{large share}} were small businesses; only 10% had more than 10 employees. Sélestat is a retail and services centre for the whole Central Alsace, with a large shopping park and administrative and educational institutions. Industry is nonetheless represented by <b>some</b> <b>large</b> firms, such as the Société alsacienne de meubles, which builds kitchens and bathrooms under a Schmidt and Cuisinella franchise, Amcor (aluminium packaging), Daramic (battery separators), Albany (gauzes for the printing industry), Wanzl (warehouse material), and DHJ (textiles).|$|E

5|$|Isopods {{belong to}} the larger group Peracarida, which are united by the {{presence}} of a special chamber under the thorax for brooding eggs. They have a cosmopolitan distribution and over 10,000 species of isopod, classified into 11 suborders, have been described worldwide. Around 4,500 species are found in marine environments, mostly on the sea floor. About 500 species are found in fresh water and another 5,000 species are the terrestrial woodlice, which form the suborder Oniscidea. In the deep sea, members of the suborder Asellota predominate, to the near exclusion of all other isopods, having undergone a large adaptive radiation in that environment. The largest isopod is in the genus Bathynomus and <b>some</b> <b>large</b> species are fished commercially for human food in Mexico, Japan and Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Marie Stopes and David Watson {{analysed}} coal ball {{samples and}} decided that coal balls formed in situ. They {{stressed the importance of}} interaction with seawater, believing that it was necessary for the formation of coal balls. Some supporters of the in situ theory believe that Stopes' and Watson's discovery of a plant stem extending through multiple coal balls shows that coal balls formed in situ, stating that the drift theory fails to explain Stopes' and Watson's observation. They also cite fragile pieces of organic material projecting outside some coal balls, contending that if the drift theory was correct, the projections would have been destroyed, and <b>some</b> <b>large</b> coal balls are large enough that they could never have been able to be transported in the first place.|$|E
5|$|On 10 September, {{however, the}} Indonesians {{proposed}} a way out: an alternative route through the Lombok Strait. The British took {{them up on}} this offer, to the relief of both parties, and the Victorious made a peaceful return through Indonesian territory. War was averted, and the climax of tensions during the Confrontation had been passed. Never again was the threat of all-out war a realistic possibility, despite <b>some</b> <b>large</b> land battles in northern Borneo the following spring, and the Confrontation wound down by late fall of 1965. It had never escalated into a major conflict, and a peace deal was signed the following year.|$|E

5|$|On {{the day of}} the robbery, 26 June 1907, the 20 organizers, {{including}} Stalin, met near Yerevan Square (just 2 {{minutes from}} the seminary, bank and viceroy's palace) to finalize their plans, and after the meeting, they went to their designated places in preparation for the attack. The Russian authorities had become aware that <b>some</b> <b>large</b> action was being planned by revolutionaries in Tiflis, and had increased the security presence in the main square; just prior to the robbery, they had been tipped off and were guarding every street corner in Yerevan Square. To deal with the increased security, gang members spotted patrolling gendarmes and police prior to the robbery and lookouts were posted looking down on the square from above.|$|E
5|$|Round Hill (sometimes spelt Roundhill) is {{an inner}} {{suburban}} area of Brighton, {{part of the}} coastal city of Brighton and Hove in England. The area contains a mix of privately owned and privately rented terraced housing, much {{of which has been}} converted for multiple occupancy, and small-scale commercial development. It was developed mostly in the late 19th century on an area of high land overlooking central Brighton, and with good views in all directions, the area became a desirable middle-class suburb—particularly the large terraced houses of Roundhill Crescent and Richmond Road, and the exclusive Park Crescent—and within a few decades the whole of the hill had been built up with smaller terraces and <b>some</b> <b>large</b> villas.|$|E
5|$|Several birds prey on meat ants. The masked woodswallow (A. personatus) and the white-browed woodswallow (Artamus superciliosus) {{will gather}} around meat ant nests and swoop at them, {{catching}} several ants before eating them. Pieces of meat ants {{have been found}} in the faeces of the red-capped robin (Petroica goodenovii), rufous whistler (Pachycephala rufiventris), hooded robin (Melanodryas cucullata) and the red-browed treecreeper (Climacteris erythrops). Meat ants that forage on Ventilago viminalis trees are often eaten by the apostlebird. <b>Some</b> <b>large</b> ground-feeding birds, such as currawongs, magpies and ravens dig out newly established colonies after a queen has found a suitable spot to nest. Small domes of excavated soil are present at such spots, revealing the queens' presence to these birds. As a result, many queens are consumed by birds, leaving many abandoned nest chambers.|$|E

5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>large</b> shark species, such as {{the tiger}} shark, the dusky shark, the great white shark and the bull shark, prey on the {{bottlenose}} dolphin, especially calves. The bottlenose dolphin is capable of defending itself by charging the predator; dolphin 'mobbing' behavior of sharks can occasionally prove fatal for the shark. Targeting a single adult dolphin can be dangerous for a shark of similar size. Killer whale populations in New Zealand and Peru have been observed preying on bottlenose dolphins, but this seems rare, and other orcas may swim with dolphins. Swimming in pods allows dolphins to better defend themselves against predators. Bottlenose dolphins either use complex evasive strategies to outswim their predators, or mobbing techniques to batter the predator to death or force it to flee.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the major}} {{architecture}} of the site core is covered by secondary forest, including <b>some</b> <b>large</b> trees, {{while much of the}} city's remains lie within the modern village, including mounds of various sizes. Some mounds were destroyed in order to build the modern streets, in other cases the mounds were robbed of stone that was reused in modern construction. There are also instances where modern houses have been built on top of ancient mound platforms. Modern houses had previously also occupied the outskirts of the acropolis but were relocated during the Guatemalan Civil War in the late 20th century due to guerrilla activity.|$|E
5|$|The Denver MSA has a gross {{metropolitan}} {{product of}} $157.6 billion in 2010, {{making it the}} 18th largest metro economy in the United States. Denver's economy is based partially on its geographic position and its connection {{to some of the}} country's major transportation systems. Because Denver is the largest city within , it has become a natural location for storage and distribution of goods and services to the Mountain States, Southwest states, as well as all western states. Another benefit for distribution is that Denver is nearly equidistant from large cities of the Midwest, such as Chicago and St. Louis and <b>some</b> <b>large</b> cities of the West Coast, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco.|$|E
