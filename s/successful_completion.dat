40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between the use of academic accommodations and <b>successful</b> program <b>completion</b> of students with disabilities enrolled in two campuses of a community college. Current and past research has focused on the role, faculty perception and student satisfaction of Disability Support Services (DSS) at postsecondary institutions. However, evidence that the use of academic accommodations actually aids in the <b>successful</b> program <b>completion</b> rate of post secondary students with disabilities does not exist. A causal-comparative research method was used to examine secondary data provided by the Office of Student Accommodations located at two community college campuses to determine whether a relationship exists between <b>successful</b> program <b>completion</b> and use of academic accommodations, disability category, academic program and academic campus setting. This study also examined whether the use of academic accommodations varied by disability category, academic campus setting, academic program and <b>successful</b> program <b>completion.</b> Results indicated that users and non-users of academic accommodations are both highly successful in completing their programs.

No formal program evaluation of C 2 ̆ 6 C had been conducted in the 2012 - 2013, 2013 - 2014, and 2014 - 2015 school years to show whether the program was effective. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the relationship between <b>successful</b> school <b>completion</b> and participation in the C 2 ̆ 6 C program. A quantitative, quasi-experimental program evaluation was conducted to determine whether C 2 ̆ 6 C 2 ̆ 7 s student-related variables including cohort, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and truancy predicted students 2 ̆ 7 <b>successful</b> school <b>completion.</b> Archival data of students eligible for graduation (N = 668) were analyzed using chi square tests and logistic regression. Results showed that the model, including C 2 ̆ 6 C participation and all student-related variables, was significant in explaining the variance for <b>successful</b> school <b>completion.</b> Follow-up analyses revealed that C 2 ̆ 6 C participation for the 2013 graduation cohort only, females, and low truancy students were significantly more likely to complete school, suggesting a need for further investigation of the program 2 ̆ 7 s implementation strategy.

The NTA works in partnership with national, regional and local agencies to: Ensure the efficient use of public funding to support effective, appropriate and accessible local services Promote evidence-based and coordinated practice, by distilling and disseminating best practice Improve performance by developing standards for treatment, promoting user and carer involvement, and expanding and developing the drug treatment workforce Monitor and develop the effectiveness of treatment. The NTA has led the successful delivery of the Department of Health’s targets to: • Double {{the number of people}} in treatment between 1998 and 2008 • Increase the percentage of those successfully completing or appropriately continuing treatment year on year.

5|$|Apollo 8 {{was planned}} to be the D mission in December 1968, crewed by McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart, {{launched}} on a Saturn V instead of two Saturn IBs. In the summer it had become clear that the LM would not be ready in time. Rather than waste the Saturn V on another simple Earth-orbiting mission, ASPO Manager George Low suggested the bold step of sending Apollo 8 to orbit the Moon instead, deferring the D mission to the next mission in March 1969, and eliminating the E mission. This would keep the program on track. The Soviet Union had sent two tortoises, mealworms, wine flies, and other lifeforms around the Moon on September 15, 1968, aboard Zond 5, and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts. The decision was not announced publicly until <b>successful</b> <b>completion</b> of Apollo 7.
