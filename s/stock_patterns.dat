40|$|Abstract: The medical {{literature}} pres-ents diabetic sensory polyneuropathy as a length-dependent process produc-ing a stocking distribution of sensory {{loss in the}} lower extremities. If a purely length-dependent etiology for diabetic sensory polyneuropathy were true, then a validated comparison of sensory loss at any equidistant site about the fore-foot will reveal findings consistent with the accepted <b>stocking</b> <b>pattern</b> of anes-thesia. A single-blinded, age-matched, control/experimental study is made into the frequency of apparent purely length-dependent A-beta fiber pathol-ogy in developing diabetic sensory polyneuropathy. Control (n = 46) and experimental (n = 83) central US sub-jects are examined with a subjective neuropathy screening questionnaire, vibratory threshold, and single-point pressure threshold testing. There is a plantar predominant pattern (61. 5 %) of sensory loss in develop-ing diabetic sensory polyneuropathy, even after adjusting for sensitivity dif-ferences between {{different areas of the}} foot. A typical <b>stocking</b> <b>pattern</b> of sen-sory loss was not found. Although axo-nal pathology is length dependent, it is not apparently a purely length-dependent process. Therefore, a purely metabolic explanation for sensory loss is unlikely. In addition, an anatomic component for A-beta fiber pathology is implied by this study...|$|R

5000|$|The British press showed {{considerable}} {{interest in}} the lace used in the wedding dress, but their published reports are at variance with available documentation, and suggest that they were briefed with common incorrect or misleading information. The facts about the lace are as follows. The effect achieved by {{the design of the}} bodice {{is similar to that of}} the decorated nets that were popular in the late 19th century, typified by the Limerick and Carrickmacross laces of Ireland. For the latter, machine-made net is used as a basis on which floral and other designs are created by various hand-needlework techniques. The press release from the Royal School of Needlework [...] states that the technique used in Kate’s wedding dress “was influenced by” traditional Carrickmacross lace technique. However, the technique itself was a completely different and modern device: floral motifs were cut out of lengths of lace produced on large 19th-century machines and stitched to machine net. Three companies are known to have produced lace for the dress: Sophie Hallette [...] and Solstiss [...] in France, and the Cluny Lace Company in Ilkeston, Derbyshire. The majority of the dress is made using the Solstiss lace, specifically the skirt and train. The styles of machine lace go by the names [...] "English Cluny" [...] and [...] "Chantilly", but should not be confused with the older hand-made bobbin laces of the same names. The lace was not specially commissioned for the dress, but chosen from <b>stock</b> <b>patterns</b> (what was formerly known only as Sophie Hallette’s [...] "950264" [...] is now known as [...] "Kate’s lace", however, this lace was only used for the bodice of the dress, the skirt and train are made of the Solstiss lace. Grace Kelly's wedding dress was also made from lace by Solstiss, a French company. All the companies involved are known to produce the highest quality of couture lace. [...] ) and hence the floral motifs available were those present in the patterns. Although roses and perhaps shamrocks may be discerned on the bodice, the much quoted daffodils and thistles needed to complete a British quartet seem to be embroidery of the truth rather than of the dress.|$|E

The objectives of this study were to examine how stream channel type (temporary vs. perennial) affected wood processing dynamics (i. e., mass loss and macroinvertebrate colonization and standing <b>stock</b> <b>patterns).</b> Two questions were addressed: (1) do mass loss rates of wood differ across hydrological gradients in stream channels?, and (2) do macroinvertebrate colonization and standing <b>stock</b> <b>patterns</b> vary in relation to hydrologic gradients? Although within each channel type both dry mass and ash free dry mass loss followed a negative exponential model (p 3 ̆c 0. 05), there wasn’t a significant between-channel difference in mass loss rates (p 3 ̆e 0. 05). Breakdown rates (-k) ranged from 0. 133 – 0. 194 year- 1 for perennial streams compared to 0. 103 – 0. 170 year- 1 in the temporary streams.

Therefore the proposed algorithm can be applied in real-time application and processing time can be reduced. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient is used to classify the preferred patterns effectively and efficiently first and use the rule sets to provide further ability for describing the query patterns so that is more effective, sensitive and constrainable in distinguishing individual patterns. Encouraging experiment is reported from the tests that the proposed scheme outperforms the other methods both effectively and efficiently, especially in differentiating the special preferred <b>stock</b> <b>patterns</b> or even distorted patterns. ...|$|E
