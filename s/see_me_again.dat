500|$|When Simone {{returned}} to the United States, she learned that a warrant had been issued for her arrest for unpaid taxes (as a protest against her country's involvement with the Vietnam War), and {{returned to}} Barbados to evade the authorities and prosecution. Simone stayed in Barbados {{for quite some time}} and she had a lengthy affair with the Prime Minister, Errol Barrow. A close friend, singer Miriam Makeba, then persuaded her to go to Liberia. Later, she lived in Switzerland and the Netherlands, before settling in France in 1993. During a 1998 performance in Newark, she announced, [...] "If you're going to come <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> you've got to come to France, because I ain't coming back." ...|$|E
500|$|Winrich Kolbe, the {{director}} of [...] "Caretaker", was involved in casting the main cast for the series. He described the casting process for the part of Chakotay as difficult due to the lower numbers of Native Americans {{who were in the}} Screen Actors Guild. The casting process came down to two actors, and the producers decided on Robert Beltran, who until then was best known for appearing in the soap opera Models Inc. and was of Mexican heritage. Beltran was not familiar with Star Trek before auditioning, and went along on the strength of the [...] "Caretaker" [...] script which showed the character becoming the second in command of Voyager after both their vessels are stranded in the Delta quadrant. Beltran explained the audition experience, [...] "I felt neutral about the audition, didn't much care one way or the other. I went in the first time and wasn't really trying to get the part. They asked to <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> and they wanted to see more of an edge to the character." ...|$|E
500|$|The rescuers {{concealed}} {{the fate}} of the snowshoe party, informing the rescued immigrants only that they did not return because they were frostbitten. Patty and Tommy Reed were soon too weak to cross the snowdrifts, and no one was strong enough to carry them. Margret Reed faced the agonizing predicament of accompanying her two older children to Bear Valley and watching her two frailest be taken back to Truckee Lake without a parent. She made rescuer Aquilla Glover swear on his honor as a Mason that he would return for her children. Patty Reed told her, [...] "Well, mother, if you never <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> do the best you can." [...] Upon their return to the lake, the Breens flatly refused them entry to their cabin but, after Glover left more food, the children were grudgingly admitted. The rescue party was dismayed to find that the first cache station had been broken into by animals, leaving them without food for four days. After struggling on the walk over the pass, John Denton slipped into a coma and died. Ada Keseberg died soon afterwards; her mother was inconsolable, refusing to let the child's body go. After several days' more travel through difficult country, the rescuers grew very concerned that the children would not survive. Some of them ate the buckskin fringe from one of the rescuer's pants, and the shoelaces of another, to the relief party's surprise. On their way down from the mountains, they met the next rescue party, which included James Reed. Upon hearing his voice, Margret sank into the snow, overwhelmed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} would have known it from themselves; but I find she has {{forbidden}} her mother to mention it till she has <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> <b>again.</b> And they talk of quiet, and shut me out!" [...] gloomily added Alick.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{never saw}} me under my right name before; you <b>see</b> <b>me</b> under my right name now. You shall <b>see</b> <b>me</b> once <b>again</b> in the body, {{when you are}} tried for your life. You shall <b>see</b> <b>me</b> once <b>again</b> in the spirit, when the cord is round your neck, and the crowd are crying against you!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I owe {{you more}} than I knew. Yet, I'm not sure, for you see I was {{abducted}} after all. Also if I had been taken there, probably George would never have married <b>me</b> or <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> and {{that might have been}} better for him." ...|$|R
2500|$|As {{an example}} of his later {{vaudeville}} career, during the off-seasons of 1892-93, which extended into the 1893 season, he appeared in January 1893 in New York at the Imperial Music Hall on West 29th Street. He was billed as [...] "King Kelly, the Monarch of the Baseball Field." [...] His trousers and shirt collar were too big and he buttoned his jacket wrong. [...] Also, his straw hat was a size too small. [...] "It was impossible {{to look at this}} vaudeville make-up and not laugh", the New York Sun said. [...] "Kelly laughed, too, and shook a roll of music at a lot of friends up in the private boxes." [...] Kelly came on after two French singers of opera. Stage partner William [...] "Billy" [...] Jerome [...] "took off his hat to him, and introduced him as 'Mr. Kelly, the famous $10,000 peach.'" [...] They sang a parody. [...] Later, after reciting [...] "Casey at the Bat", he said, according to the Sun, [...] "I'm right at home with Casey." [...] Also, [...] "It's the first time I’ve been in these clothes, and I don’t quite understand them. [...] Besides I’ve been over to Guttenberg [...] to-day, and that is an excuse for anything that a man may do. Come and <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>again.</b> I’m obliged for your welcome." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Miss Dearborn," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "don't {{think that}} I am like that man out there! Don't think that I will persecute {{you if you}} don't wish to hear me; that I will follow you about and make your life miserable. If you say {{to me that you}} do not wish to <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> you will never <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>again.</b> Say what you please, and you will find that I am a gentleman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-by, old man! You musn't trouble {{yourself}} to say 'Merry Christmas' now, but {{wait until you}} <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>again.</b> Take care of yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say no more, please. Come and <b>see</b> <b>me</b> soon <b>again.</b> I would press you to remain, {{but it is}} {{striking}} nine, and the first of my pupils is about to arrive." ...|$|R
60|$|Hugo. That will I not. I'll {{have no more}} of thee, false lord! The king will well reward me, and thou mayst keep thy gold. Farewell! Thou wilt <b>see</b> <b>me</b> once <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|Taking the {{antelope}} with us, we all {{returned to the}} launch, where we found Taylor as delighted to <b>see</b> <b>me</b> alive <b>again</b> as Delcarte had been. I cannot say truthfully that Snider evinced much enthusiasm at my rescue.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{certainly}} does believe it, Jim," [...] my cousin answered gravely. [...] "She was here last week--she {{is coming to}} <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>again</b> to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, now, sleep your best, and don't {{be frightened}} if you <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> for I'll slip down by and by, {{and give you}} another sprinkle." ...|$|E
6000|$|Don't {{bother to}} answer now, (for you've writing {{enough to do}} without {{allowing}} me {{to add to the}} burden,) but tell me when you <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>again!</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Barry advised Woody Harrelson for {{his role}} as a mentalist in the 2013 film, Now You <b>See</b> <b>Me,</b> and <b>again</b> for its {{upcoming}} 2016 sequel Now You <b>See</b> <b>Me</b> 2. Barry prepped Harrelson for a successful performance on the Late Show with David Letterman during the marketing of the first film.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll do my best," [...] he said graciously. [...] "Better than that. I'm sorry I came in {{late for}} dinner. In {{years and years}} you'll never <b>see</b> <b>me</b> late <b>again.</b> I won't bother you at all. You'll see. It {{will be just as}} though I wasn't in the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Halloo, you, sir!" [...] {{cried the}} master-at-arms, [...] "top your boom and sail large, now. If I <b>see</b> you about <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> I'll have {{you up to}} the mast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess I {{might as}} well say good-bye here," [...] she said dully. [...] "You won't want to <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> of course. Will you--shake hands--Mr. McManus." ...|$|E
6000|$|He gave {{me another}} smile, sadder, fainter, sweeter than before, and said: [...] "When {{would you like}} to <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> so I could work out this dollar?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good morning, then," [...] said he, [...] "I hope you'll do better," [...] and {{he bowed}} me {{out as if}} he {{expected}} to <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>again</b> pretty soon.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, mistress, {{listen to}} me," [...] she said earnestly. [...] "You have <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> like this before, have you not, when I {{was about to}} be hanged, and you bought my life at a price? Well, as it chances, that man who guards the hut is he who took me at Bull-Head's bidding and set the rope round my neck, whereon I said some words to him which made him afraid. Now if he <b>sees</b> <b>me</b> <b>again</b> thus in a hut where he knows you to be alone, he will think that I am a ghost and his heart will turn to ice and the {{strength}} of his hands to water, and then before he can find his strength again I shall make an end of him with the spear, as I know well how to do although I am so small, and we will fly." ...|$|R
6000|$|At last Perseus spoke: 'Ye {{farmers and}} fishers, ye ship-captains and slave dealers {{of a little}} isle, I shall bring to your master such a present as none of you dare to seek. Farewell. Ye shall <b>see</b> <b>me</b> once <b>again</b> and no more. I go to slay the Gorgon, and bring such a gift as no king possesses--the Head of the Gorgon.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't give up like that," [...] cried Rilla, {{her pale}} face {{suddenly}} flushing. [...] "I won't despair. We are not conquered--no, if Germany overruns all France {{we are not}} conquered. I am ashamed of myself for this hour of despair. You won't <b>see</b> <b>me</b> slump <b>again</b> like that, I'm going to ring up town at once and ask for particulars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I don't think I'll do it to-night, Mr. Haskers," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "I--I want {{to sleep}} on it. Come and <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>again</b> in the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Send off the messengers," [...] I {{shouted to}} my father. [...] "If you would <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>again</b> send them swiftly, and follow with every man you can raise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{that young}} person--Miss Merton I think her name is--attempts to <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>again</b> before I leave, {{be sure that}} she is not admitted," [...] she told the servant.|$|E
6000|$|... "With all my heart," [...] said Bax. [...] "I spent {{a couple}} of hours with him this forenoon, and he {{appeared}} to me better than usual. <b>Seeing</b> Tommy and <b>me</b> <b>again</b> has cheered him greatly, poor old man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had forgotten," [...] said Grisell. [...] "I {{saw myself}} once at Amesbury! but {{my face was}} not well then. Let <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>again,</b> sister! Where's a mirror?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mark Tapley is it?' {{said the}} gentleman. 'Then Mark Tapley {{had not only}} the great politeness to follow me to this house, but is waiting now, to <b>see</b> <b>me</b> home <b>again.</b> And for that attention, sir,' added Mr Tigg, {{stroking}} his moustache, 'I can tell you, that Mark Tapley had better in his infancy have been fed to suffocation by Mrs Tapley, than preserved to this time.' ...|$|R
6000|$|O, {{that evening}} of bliss--shall I ever [...] Forget it?--with Shakespeare and Poe! [...] She said, when 'twas ended: [...] "You're never [...] To <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>again.</b> And now go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{we shall}} have lost," [...] Peter Ruff said, calmly. [...] "If you don't <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>again</b> to-night, you had better read the {{newspapers}} carefully {{for the next few}} days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes;--if {{you would}} never <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>again.</b> I know it all, {{and that would be}} best." [...] She was now walking about the room. [...] "Why should you see it all?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True enough, Nigel; so may every Squire ride to {{the wars}} with his soul on fire, as yours is now. But I must linger no longer, for the King's service must be done. I will dress, and when I have bid {{farewell}} to the noble Dame Ermyntrude I will on to Farnham; but you will <b>see</b> <b>me</b> here <b>again</b> {{on the day that}} the King comes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Deserted from my ship. The {{devil was in}} me to be off on the tramp, and father's letter did the rest. I got {{wild and}} desperate {{with the thought of}} what had {{happened}} to Mary, and with knowing they were ashamed to <b>see</b> <b>me</b> back <b>again</b> at home. So the night afore the ship sailed for England I slipped into a shore-boat, and turned my back on salt-junk and the boatswain's mate {{for the rest of my}} life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{animosity}} shown {{towards me}} by your father," [...] he wrote, in this coldest of marital epistles, [...] "is such that I cannot return again to a roof which is his, {{even though it}} shelters you. A parting is unavoidable, as you are sure {{to be on his}} side in this division. I am starting on a journey which will take me a long way from Hintock, and you must not expect to <b>see</b> <b>me</b> there <b>again</b> for some time." ...|$|R
