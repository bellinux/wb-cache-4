Research indicated that there are significant long-term attendant benefits: better school achievement, better school attainment, and better adult success. This research used the 2004 senior class of Logan County Schools in Russellville, Kentucky and examined the rate of special education placement, retention, suspension and dropout for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> attended a preschool program versus <b>students</b> <b>who</b> did not attend a preschool program. Results of this research showed, there is no difference in special education percentages between <b>students</b> <b>who</b> attended preschool and <b>students</b> <b>who</b> did not attend preschool; and there is no difference in retention rates between <b>students</b> <b>who</b> attended preschool and <b>students</b> <b>who</b> did not attend preschool; there is a difference in suspension rates between <b>students</b> <b>who</b> attended preschool and <b>students</b> <b>who</b> did not attend preschool; there is no difference in dropout rates between <b>students</b> <b>who</b> attended preschool and <b>students</b> <b>who</b> did not attend preschool...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{possible}} relationships between participation in extracurricular activities and student achievement, participation in extracurricular activities and attendance, and participation in extracurricular activities and behavior. The setting for this study was a high school in western Nebraska. Data for 275 of the school district 2 ̆ 7 s 2007 - 2008 and 2008 - 2009 high school graduates were obtained from the high school activities office and the school district 2 ̆ 7 s student management system. Ten research hypotheses were tested using appropriate statistical analyses. ^ Relationships were found for five research hypotheses: (1) <b>Students</b> <b>who</b> participated in extracurricular activities had higher grade point averages than <b>students</b> <b>who</b> did not participate. (2) <b>Students</b> <b>who</b> participated in extracurricular activities had a higher rate of school attendance than <b>students</b> <b>who</b> did not participate. (3) <b>Students</b> <b>who</b> participated in only sport activities received more disciplinary referrals than <b>students</b> <b>who</b> participated in only non-sport activities. (4) Students whose families have a higher level of socio-economic status were more likely to participate in extracurricular activities. (5) White students were more likely to participate in extracurricular activities than Hispanic and other racial ethnic backgrounds. ^ No relationships were found for five research hypotheses: (1) Between grade point averages of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> participated in only sports activities and grade point averages of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> participated in only non-sport activities. (2) Between attendance of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> participated in only sports activities and attendance of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> participated in only non-sport activities.

30|$|Generally, <b>students</b> <b>who</b> {{came from}} business-owned family {{are more likely}} to be {{self-employed}} compared to <b>students</b> <b>who</b> came from non-business-owned families. But <b>students</b> <b>who</b> have business-owned colleagues are not significantly different from <b>students</b> <b>who</b> do not have business-owned colleagues. Table  8 tells us that <b>students</b> <b>who</b> came from business-owned families were 25.4 % (OR[*]=[*] 1.254) more likely to be self-employed compared to <b>students</b> <b>who</b> came from non-business-owned families. The reason might be that they may have prior business experience from families. The experience gained from their family member may influence the students’ engagement in entrepreneurship. This is in agreement with the findings in other studies (Fitzsimmons and Douglass, 2005; Dohse and Walter, 2012; Sanditov and Verspagen, 2011; Robson, 2015). Similarly, the odd of self-employment intention of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> have prior business experience from their family was 45.1 % more likely to be self-employed than <b>students</b> <b>who</b> have no any prior business experience from their family controlling other variables.|$|R
