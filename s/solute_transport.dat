5|$|The {{riddle of}} water and {{nutrient}} transport through the plant remained. Physiologist Von Mohl explored <b>solute</b> <b>transport</b> and the theory of water uptake by the roots using the concepts of cohesion, transpirational pull, capillarity and root pressure. German dominance {{in the field of}} physiology was underlined by the publication of the definitive textbook on plant physiology synthesising the work of this period, Sach's e of 1882. There were, however, some advances elsewhere such as the early exploration of geotropism (the effect of gravity on growth) by Englishman Thomas Knight, and the discovery and naming of osmosis by Frenchman Henri Dutrochet (1776–1847).|$|E

40|$|One {{critical}} step in tumor metastasis is tumor cell adhesion to the endothelium forming the microvessel wall. Understanding this step {{may lead to}} new therapeutic concepts for tumor metastasis. Vascular endothelium forming the microvessel wall and the glycocalyx layer at its surface are the principal barriers to, and regulators of the material exchange between circulating blood and body tissues. The cleft between adjacent ECs (interendothelial cleft) is the principal pathway for water and <b>solutes</b> <b>transport</b> through the microvessel wall in health. It is also suggested to be the pathway for high molecular weight plasma proteins, leukocytes and tumor cells across microvessel walls in disease. Thus {{the first part of}} the review introduced the mathematical models for water and <b>solutes</b> <b>transport</b> through the interendothelial cleft. These models, combined with the experimental results from in vivo animal studies and electron microscopic observations, are used to evaluate the role of the endothelial surface glycocalyx, the junction strand geometry in the interendothelial cleft, and the surrounding extracellular matrix and tissue cells, as the determinants of microvascular transport. The second part of the review demonstrated how the microvascular permeability, hydrodynamic factors, microvascular geometry and cell adhesion molecules affect tumor cell adhesion in the microcirculation.

50|$|In active <b>transport</b> a <b>solute</b> {{is moved}} against a {{concentration}} or electrochemical gradient; {{in doing so}} the transport proteins involved consume metabolic energy, usually ATP. In primary active transport the hydrolysis of the energy provider (e.g. ATP) takes place directly in order to <b>transport</b> the <b>solute</b> in question, for instance, when the transport proteins are ATPase enzymes. Where the hydrolysis of the energy provider is indirect {{as is the case}} in secondary active transport, use is made of the energy stored in an electrochemical gradient. For example, in co-transport use is made of the gradients of certain <b>solutes</b> to <b>transport</b> a target compound against its gradient, causing the dissipation of the solute gradient. It may appear that, in this example, there is no energy use, but hydrolysis of the energy provider is required to establish the gradient of the <b>solute</b> <b>transported</b> along with the target compound. The gradient of the co-transported solute will be generated through the use of certain types of proteins called biochemical pumps.|$|R

[...] Instead, they stretch to compensate for dead cells which reduces the overall cell density of the endothelium, which affects fluid regulation. [...] If the endothelium can no longer maintain a proper fluid balance, stromal swelling due to excess fluids and subsequent loss of transparency will occur and this may cause corneal edema and interference with the transparency of the cornea and thus impairing the image formed. Iris pigment cells deposited on the corneal endothelium can sometimes be washed into a distinct vertical pattern by the aqueous currents - this is known as Krukenberg's Spindle.|$|E

5000|$|Both HYDRUS models {{may be used}} to {{simulate}} movement of water, heat, and multiple solutes in variably saturated media. Both programs use linear finite elements to numerically solve the Richards equation for saturated-unsaturated water flow and Fickian-based advection dispersion equations for both heat and <b>solute</b> <b>transport.</b> The flow equation also includes a sink term to account for water uptake by plant roots as a function of both water and salinity stress. The unsaturated soil hydraulic properties can be described using van Genuchten, Brooks and Corey, modified van Genuchten, Kosugi, and Durner type analytical functions. The heat transport equation considers conduction as well as advection with flowing water. The <b>solute</b> <b>transport</b> equations assume advective-dispersive transport in the liquid phase, and diffusion in the gaseous phase. The transport equations further include provisions for nonlinear and/or non-equilibrium reactions between the solid and liquid phases, linear equilibrium reactions between the liquid and gaseous phases, zero-order production, and two first-order degradation reactions: one which is independent of other solutes, and one which provides the coupling between solutes involved in sequential first order decay reactions. In addition, physical non-equilibrium <b>solute</b> <b>transport</b> can be accounted for by assuming a two-region, dual-porosity type formulation which partitions the liquid phase into mobile and immobile regions.|$|E

In apoplastic transport, water and minerals flow in an upward direction via the apoplast to the xylem in the root. The concentration of <b>solutes</b> <b>transported</b> in aboveground organs is established through a combination of import from the xylem, absorption by cells, and export by the phloem. Transport velocity is higher in the apoplast than the symplast. This method of transport also accounts for a higher proportion of water transport in plant tissues than does symplastic transport. The apoplastic pathway is also involved in passive exclusion. Some of the ions that enter through the roots do not make it to the xylem.

50|$|The SWMS_2D model (Šimůnek et al., 1992) {{considerably}} {{extended the}} capabilities of SWMII by including provisions for <b>solute</b> <b>transport.</b> <b>Solute</b> <b>transport</b> was described using the standard advection-dispersion equation that included linear sorption, first-order degradation in both the liquid and solid phases, and zero-order production in both phases. Several other numerical improvements were at the time also implemented in SWMS_2D. These included solution of the mixed form of the Richards equation as suggested by Celia et al. (1990), thus providing excellent mass balances in the water flow calculations. While SWMII could simulate water flow in either two-dimensional vertical or horizontal planes, SWMS_2D extended the range of applications also to three-dimensional axisymetrical flow domains around a vertical axis of symmetry. Examples are flow to a well, infiltration from a surface ring or tension disc infiltrometer, and infiltration from a surface or subsurface dripper.|$|E

Once the runoff content stabilized, heavier rainfall rates afforded higher runoff solute content. With respect to the time elapsed between the initiation of rainfall and the formation of the runoff, heavy rainfall was associated with a decrease in the cumulative infiltration, and so the quantity of <b>solutes</b> <b>transported</b> into the deeper soils by infiltration was reduced at higher rainfall intensities. In conjunction with the greater impact of raindrops and increased runoff flow under these conditions, this caused increases in the runoff solute concentration at higher rainfall intensities, as concluded by Wallach et al.

In the T-R, solute ions in the mobile region can freely move by dispersion but can only move and exchange by diffusion in the immobile region. The values of the mobile–immobile partition coefficient, β, became smaller with increases in the pore water velocity (Table  1). This was dependent on the initial tracer input {{in the presence of}} macrospores, since a portion of the <b>solute</b> <b>transported</b> by preferential flow moves quickly down the soil column without fully interacting with the soil matrix. Increasing pore water velocity results in greater resistance to preferential flow through the macrospores, so that convection and diffusion of ions in the mobile region will be reduced relative to the immobile region, resulting in reductions {{in the value of the}} mobile–immobile partition coefficient, β.|$|R
