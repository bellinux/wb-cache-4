40|$|Electricity {{consumption}} in the United Kingdom is continually growing with demand from the domestic sector a potential/major contribution to this increase in consumption. Although demand is increasing, little information exists on the domestic components that contribute {{to an increase in}} domestic energy consumption. Thus, a greater understanding on what is contributing to the increase in domestic energy usage is a pre-requisite to understand how it can be reduced in the future or, if not reduced, contained at its current level. This article discusses a <b>separation</b> <b>filter</b> designed for disaggregating domestic electrical demand data into different appliance categories. The filter is applied to a real time domestic electrical dataset spanning 1 Â year, and trends in standby, cold, heating element spikes and residual demand are identified. Several reasons to account for each of the trends are discussed. Additionally, the filter is applied to synthetic data both to confirm the accuracy of the <b>separation</b> <b>filter</b> and to finely adjust the filter for future application. The results indicate an increase in occupancy-related demand consumption during the winter months and an increase in cold consumption during the summer months. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that in contrast to changes observed in occupancy-related demand and cold consumption, there is little variation in standby and heating element spike consumption throughout the year. Finally, the potential advantage of incorporating a tailored <b>separation</b> <b>filter</b> into domestic smart meters is discussed.

The other two accomplish multicarrier vestigial sideband modulation (VSB). Intersymbol interference is eliminated by appropriately designing the prototypes. The two band case is treated as a special case. For this case, the extra flexibility in choosing the center frequencies leads to the synthesis of additional transmultiplexers. I...|$|R

Next, when the current time period is voiced block, the higher-order ICA's re-optimization is applied using the previously obtained SO-ICA's solution as the initial filter; this results in a fast and high convergence.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} a step-size parameter adaptation technique of multi-channel semi-blind independent component analysis (MCSB-ICA) for a “barge-in-able ” robot audition system. By “barge-in”, we {{mean that the}} user can speak simultaneously when the robot is speaking. We focused on MCSB-ICA to achieve such an audition system because it can separate a user’s and a robot’s speech under reverberant environments. The problem with MCSB-ICA for robot audition is the slow speed of convergence in estimating a <b>separation</b> <b>filter</b> due to its step-size parameters. Many optimization methods cannot be adopted because their computational costs are proportional to the 2 nd order of the reverberation time. Our method yields adaptive step-size parameters with MCSB-ICA at low computational costs. It is based on three techniques; 1) recursive expression of the separation process, 2) a piecewise linear model of the step-size of the <b>separation</b> <b>filter,</b> and 3) adaptive step-size parameters with a sub-ICA-filter. Experimental results show that our approach attains faster convergence speed and lower computational costs than those with a fixed step-size parameter. I...|$|E

30|$|In Table  1, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} for input (stream 1) during the segment from 16 to 20  s, the SIR {{improvement}} shown by the CFDD on a small section of speech is only 1.6  dB. It is due to an anomaly (permutation misalignments): certain harmonics that need to be suppressed more are not suppressed at all. These anomalies do happen due to the slow learning process of the CFDD but reduce in amplitude as time progresses. However, these limitations are addressed in the FDAFS (second stage) as can be seen in Table  1. It is pertinent to mention that this slow learning process is to avoid local solution (associated with the non-stationary nature of speech signals). If the weight factor is increased in the algorithm (CFDD), the separation can be achieved in 2  s, but this separation will be local. The coefficients of this separation when applied to the next segment of the convolutive mixture of speech signals will not do any separation. So, either another local solution (permuted) is obtained (that is useless) or true <b>separation</b> <b>filters</b> are calculated. For this reason, longer speech results (40  s) have been shown to verify the convergence of the algorithm to its true minimum and thus obtaining the true <b>separation</b> <b>filters.</b>|$|R
