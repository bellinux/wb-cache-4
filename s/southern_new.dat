The changes meant that WIN expanded {{into the rest of}} <b>southern</b> <b>New</b> South Wales, launching new stations in Canberra, Orange, Bathurst, Dubbo and Wagga Wagga, amongst others in 1989, {{and at the same time}} acquiring new facilities in Orange, Wagga and Canberra.

5|$|A {{squall line}} which moved {{offshore}} New York and <b>southern</b> <b>New</b> England formed a mesoscale convective vortex, which fired new thunderstorm activity each day {{as it moved}} within the westerlies across the northern Atlantic.

By 2100UTC on July 24, the National Hurricane Center began classifying the system as Tropical Depression Two. In the first advisory on the depression, it was noted that the previous tropical depression was erroneously classified as Tropical Depression Two.|$|E
