5|$|In Small Heath's {{last game}} in October, {{at home to}} Darwen, a 3–2 victory was marred by a serious injury to full-back Fred <b>Speller.</b> Soon after kickoff. <b>Speller</b> was {{in the act of}} kicking the ball when the onrushing William Campbell {{collided}} with him, knocking him to the ground. A police constable administered first aid before the player, whose leg was broken, was carried from the field on a plank and taken to hospital. On a heavy pitch in poor condition, it was nearly impossible to dribble the ball, and Small Heath's decision to play on with only one back meant Darwen's attackers were frequently caught offside.|$|E
5|$|Small Heath {{entered the}} 1892–93 FA Cup {{at the first}} round proper, and lost in that round to First Division club Burnley. In local competitions, they were {{eliminated}} by Aston Villa in the semi-final of the Birmingham Senior Cup and {{the final of the}} Mayor of Birmingham's Charity Cup. Small Heath also played several friendly matches during the season, including benefit matches for players Harry Morris, Caesar Jenkyns and Fred <b>Speller.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{dislodge}} Wheldon or Billy Walton {{from the inside}} forward position, Harry Edwards chose to leave {{at the end of}} the season. Tom Bayley was released, and Fred Jones left for Lincoln City after losing his place at left back to Bernard Pumfrey. Harry Morris retired to concentrate on his plumbing business. Fred <b>Speller</b> attempted a comeback, appearing twice for the first team in September 1893, but the injury received against Darwen effectively proved the end of his football career.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spellers</b> {{are divided}} into groups, with four <b>spellers</b> in each group. Members of each group compete in a {{traditional}} spelling bee, wherethey spell until {{there are only two}} <b>spellers</b> left. If all four <b>spellers</b> spell correctly or incorrectly in the same round,they will all spell again until two remain.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} Speed Spell, the Top 6 {{were deemed}} safe from elimination. In no {{particular}} order, those <b>spellers</b> were Marko, Anirudh, Mica, Tej, Grace D and Jack B. The remaining 12 <b>spellers</b> went head-to-head in Flash Cards, where the theme was technology. The winning <b>spellers,</b> Harrison, Aimee, Amelia, Amanda, Holly R and Stuart were then safe from elimination. In the final spelling bee, 6 <b>spellers</b> spelling in multiple rounds to determine the 2 <b>spellers</b> who would be safe from elimination (Jye and Grace P). The other 4 <b>spellers,</b> Ben, Bella, Timothy and Josie were sent home.|$|R
50|$|There were 249 <b>spellers</b> this year. Eighty-six <b>spellers</b> survived {{day one of}} the competition.|$|R
5|$|The Mormons {{had planned}} to use the profits from sale of the earlier books to fund {{printing}} of more books, and in anticipation Orson Pratt had already transcribed the complete Bible, Doctrine and Covenants, and John Jaques's Catechism for Children. Pratt had also prepared an apparent sequel to the primers, the Deseret Phonetic <b>Speller.</b> After the sales failure, however, none of these books were ever published and were thought lost until being rediscovered in a storage area of the LDS Church Archives in Salt Lake City in May 1967.|$|E
5|$|Fred <b>Speller</b> {{attempted}} a comeback, appearing twice {{for the first}} team early in the season, but the injury received against Darwen proved {{the end of his}} professional football career. Bernard Pumfrey left for Midland League club Gainsborough Trinity, and went on to captain that club in the Football League. Walter Jackson, William Reynolds and Gilbert Smith were all released to join Birmingham & District League club Berwick Rangers, and Percy Watson returned to his native Yorkshire. Chris Charsley played no more League football, concentrating instead on his police career: he reached the rank of Chief Inspector in the Birmingham force, and in 1899 was appointed Chief Constable of Coventry. Small Heath signed the former Sunderland full back Jack Oliver, whom they had failed to recruit earlier in the season, but despite the misgivings of the local press, they were to negotiate their debut First Division season with no other major signings.|$|E
5|$|Akeelah Anderson, an 11-year-old {{spelling}} enthusiast, attends Crenshaw Middle School, {{a predominantly}} black school in South Los Angeles. She {{lives with her}} widowed mother Tanya, her older sister Kiana, her older brothers Devon and Terrence, and her infant niece. Her principal Mr. Welch suggests that she {{sign up for the}} Crenshaw Schoolwide Spelling Bee. She follows his advice and wins. Soon after, Dr. Joshua Larabee, a visiting English professor and Mr. Welch's friend from college, tests Akeelah and decides that she is good enough to compete in the National Spelling Bee. Nevertheless, Dr. Larabee declines to coach her because she is rude to him. As a result, Akeelah studies on her own to prepare for the district spelling bee. Although Akeelah misspells her word during the final round of the bee, she qualifies for the regional bee when Kiana catches the other finalist cheating. Akeelah also meets and befriends Javier Mendez, a 12-year-old Mexican American boy and fellow <b>speller.</b> Javier invites her to join the spelling club at his Woodland Hills middle school.|$|E
5000|$|There were 137 <b>spellers</b> this year, 83 {{girls and}} 54 boys. [...] Ten <b>spellers</b> {{went out in}} the first round on day one, and 17 in the second round. After lunch on day one, 16 <b>spellers</b> dropped out in the third round, and 42 in the fourth round, leaving 52 <b>spellers</b> at 5:10pm to make it to day two. A total of 574 words were used.|$|R
5000|$|Leaf’s Siblings: Not very {{confident}} of Leaf’s abilities. Usually {{played by the}} remaining <b>spellers</b> (both cast and the volunteer audience <b>spellers).</b>|$|R
5000|$|After {{the first}} day and three rounds, the {{competition}} was reduced by 101 <b>spellers.</b> 69 <b>spellers</b> made it to sixth round, a [...] "killer round" [...] which then eliminated 31 more. 19 <b>spellers</b> were then eliminated in the seventh round. [...] A total of 963 words were used.|$|R
5|$|Of {{the regular}} first-team {{members from the}} {{previous}} season, goalkeeper Chris Charsley, a serving police officer, was unavailable and full back Tom Bayley had been released. Fred <b>Speller,</b> who had suffered a badly broken leg early in the season, had been playing in practice matches and {{was believed to be}} back to full fitness. Fringe players Harry Edwards and Fred Jones had left the club, and Harry Morris had retired to concentrate on his plumbing business. Goalkeeper George Hollis, backs Arthur Littleford, Bernard Pumfrey and George Short, half-backs Ted Devey, Caesar Jenkyns, Teddy Jolley and Billy Ollis, and forwards Jack Hallam, Tommy Hands, Frank Mobley, Billy Walton and Fred Wheldon all remained with the club. Newcomers included forwards Jack Lee, Charles Izon and Walter Jackson, all signed from non-league clubs in the West Midlands area. Alfred Jones continued as secretary-manager, and Caesar Jenkyns retained the captaincy. The team adopted a new kit, keeping the white knickerbockers but replacing the royal blue shirt and stockings with shirts in a lighter shade of blue, with navy collar trim, cuffs and pocket and navy stockings.|$|E
5|$|Other players {{took part}} in {{significant}} matches {{in the history of}} the club. Harry Morris and Eddy Stanley appeared in every match as Small Heath Alliance progressed through six rounds to the semi-final of the 1885–86 FA Cup. Tom Bayley, George Short and Fred <b>Speller</b> appeared in Small Heath's first Football League match in 1892. In more recent times, John Gayle scored the winning goal as Birmingham beat Tranmere Rovers in the 1991 Football League Trophy Final. The 18-year-old Darren Carter converted the decisive penalty in the 2002 play-off final shootout by which Birmingham were promoted to the Premier League for the first time; goalkeeper Nico Vaesen saved one of the opponents' spot-kicks. The Birmingham team that won the 2011 League Cup featured six men listed here, including Ben Foster, who won the man of the match award. Teenagers Nathan Redmond and Chris Wood scored two of the three goals that took Birmingham through to the group stage of the Europa League in the club's first season in European competition for 50 years.|$|E
25|$|Noah Webster {{was born}} in Hartford {{in an area that}} is now part of West Hartford and was the author of the Blue Backed <b>Speller,</b> now known as Webster's Dictionary. The <b>Speller</b> was used to teach {{spelling}} to five generations of Americans.|$|E
50|$|The {{remaining}} <b>spellers</b> follow normal Spelling Bee rules. Only two <b>spellers</b> {{may be safe}} {{in every}} round, while the rest are eliminated.|$|R
5000|$|There were 226 <b>spellers</b> this year, 127 {{girls and}} 99 boys. [...] The {{youngest}} competitor was 9 year old Erika Harrell from Muncie, Indiana. [...] Eight <b>spellers</b> dropped out in round one, 33 dropped in round two, and 30 were eliminated in round three. 155 <b>spellers</b> survived into day two.|$|R
5000|$|After Round 4 (the {{first round}} of day 3), 6 more <b>spellers</b> were {{eliminated}}, leaving 34 competitors. [...] Twelve-spellers were eliminated in Round 5, leaving 22 (11 boys and 11 girls). [...] Seventeen <b>spellers</b> survived Round 6. After two more <b>spellers</b> dropped in Round 7, the final 15 advanced to the evening finals.|$|R
25|$|<b>Speller</b> was {{transferred}} to the Winson Green asylum in Birmingham on 6 July 1909, and died five weeks later.|$|E
25|$|He {{struggled}} violently, and {{it required}} several constables to convey {{him to the}} station. In his cell he smashed the windows and became so dangerous {{that he had to}} be strongly bound. Dr. Cronyn certified that <b>Speller</b> was insane.|$|E
25|$|Small Heath used 23 {{different}} {{players in}} nationally organised competitive matches {{during the season}} and had eleven different goalscorers. Five players, full-back Fred <b>Speller,</b> half-backs Ted Devey and Billy Ollis, and forwards Jack Hallam and Fred Wheldon, were ever-present over the 29-match season. The top scorer was inside-forward Wheldon with 29 goals in all competitions, of which 21 were scored in the Alliance. Caesar Jenkyns became {{the first player to}} be capped for his country while a Small Heath player when he took the field for Wales against Ireland on 27 February 1892.|$|E
40|$|Children (aged 10 to 12) with {{spelling}} disability (related to dyslexia) or {{with good}} spelling ability performed 2 fMRI nonverbal working memory tasks of comparable difficulty across groups {{in and out}} of the scanner-judging whether a pictured sea creature appeared two trials earlier (2 -back) or was a target whale (0 -back). The 2 -back versus 0 -back contrast captures ability of working memory to track changes over time. On this contrast, the good <b>spellers</b> and disabled <b>spellers</b> showed significant BOLD activation in many and generally the same brain regions. On group map comparisons, the good <b>spellers</b> never activated more than the disabled <b>spellers,</b> but the disabled <b>spellers</b> activated more than the good <b>spellers</b> in selected brain regions. Of most interest, 2 clusters of BOLD activation (distributed across brain regions) were observed in good <b>spellers</b> but 5 clusters were observed in disabled <b>spellers.</b> Within these clusters the good and disabled <b>spellers</b> differed in three regions (bilateral medial superior frontal gyrus, orbital middle frontal gyrus, and anterior cingulated), which are associated with cognition, executive functions, and working memory and were correlated with a behavioral spelling measure. Thus working memory is best described as a distributed architecture rather than a single mechanism; and good and poor <b>spellers</b> engage working memory architecture differently. We propose that spelling is an executive function for translating cognition into language (sounds and morphemes) and then into visual symbols rather than a mere transcription skill for translating words in memory into written symbols in external memory...|$|R
50|$|There were {{a record}} 293 <b>spellers</b> this year (the highest ever as of 2017). 41 <b>spellers</b> {{made it to}} the final day of {{competition}} on Thursday.|$|R
5000|$|There were 120 <b>spellers</b> this year, and a {{total of}} 571 words were used. 46 <b>spellers</b> made it to the second day. Round 4 on day one was {{especially}} harsh on the contestants, knocking out 44 <b>spellers</b> on 90 words. The final rounds were completed shortly before noon on June 4. Alex Cameron was the official pronouncer for the first time, replacing Richard R. Baker, who had retired. [...] The top prize was $1,000, followeed by $500 for second and $250 for third. The next five <b>spellers</b> reach received $100.|$|R
25|$|Pullman married Judith <b>Speller</b> in 1970 {{and began}} {{teaching}} children aged 9 to 13 at Bishop Kirk Middle School in Summertown, North Oxford and writing school plays. His first published work was The Haunted Storm, which was joint-winner of the New English Library's Young Writer's Award in 1972. He nevertheless refuses to discuss it. Galatea, an adult fantasy-fiction novel, followed in 1978, {{but it was}} his school plays which inspired his first children's book, Count Karlstein, in 1982. He stopped teaching shortly after the publication of The Ruby in the Smoke (1986), his second children's book, which has a Victorian setting.|$|E
25|$|Small Heath {{were elected}} to the Second Division of the Football League for its inaugural season in 1892. In October, in a match against Darwen, <b>Speller</b> broke his leg in {{collision}} with opponent William Campbell. The Birmingham Daily Post reported it thus: He {{was taken to the}} Queen's Hospital for treatment. The following April, Small Heath and Darwen played a benefit match for Speller; unfortunately for the beneficiary, the attendance was adversely affected by the Birmingham Charity Cup match between Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion on the same day. A variety of full-backs stood in for him as Small Heath {{went on to win the}} Second Division title.|$|E
25|$|The reform {{movement}} in education began in Massachusetts when Horace Mann started the common school movement. Mann advocated a statewide curriculum and instituted financing of school through local property taxes. Mann also fought protracted battles against the Calvinist influence in discipline, preferring positive reinforcement to physical punishment. Most children {{learned to read}} and write and spell from Noah Webster's Blue Backed <b>Speller</b> and later the McGuffey Readers. The readings inculcated moral values as well as literacy. Most states tried to emulate Massachusetts, and New England retained its leadership position for another century. German immigrants brought in kindergartens and the Gymnasium (school), while Yankee orators sponsored the Lyceum movement that provided popular education for hundreds of towns and small cities.|$|E
50|$|There were 63 <b>spellers</b> this year, {{and boys}} (34) outnumbered girls (29) {{for the first}} time. Three <b>spellers</b> were return contestants, {{including}} Sachko, who had placed 6th in 1954.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the frequency of children’s spelling strategy use in the primary levels of learning English. It also compared {{the use of these}} strategies in good and average <b>spellers</b> with those of poor <b>spellers.</b> The participants of this study were 32 Iranian children at the first stages of learning to spell rated as being either low, average, or above average <b>spellers.</b> The children were asked to spell 20 words in a dictation. They were observed while spelling and were asked about the strategy they used to spell each word immediately after spelling. The results showed that retrieval was the most frequently used strategy by the participants most frequently used by the participants followed by sounding out and analogy. Considering the use of strategies in good, average, and poor <b>spellers,</b> it was concluded that the most common strategies for spelling were used more often by good and average <b>spellers</b> and less often by poor <b>spellers...</b>|$|R
5000|$|By 10am on day two, eight <b>spellers</b> remained. [...] By round 11, {{they were}} down to five <b>spellers.</b> The {{competition}} ended in the 14th round, {{with a total of}} 610 words used.|$|R
25|$|An {{alternative}} approach called analyzer-based imaging was first explored in 1995 by Viktor Ingal and Elena Beliaevskaya at the X-ray laboratory in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and by Tim Davis {{and colleagues at}} the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) Division of Material Science and Technology in Clayton, Australia. This method uses a Bragg crystal as angular filter to reflect {{only a small part}} of the beam fulfilling the Bragg condition onto a detector. Important contributions to the progress of this method have been made by a US collaboration of the research teams of Dean Chapman, Zhong Zhong and William Thomlinson, for example the extracting of an additional signal caused by ultra-small angle scattering and the first CT image made with analyzer-based imaging. An alternative to analyzer-based imaging, which provides equivalent results without requiring the use of a crystal, was developed by Alessandro Olivo and co-workers at the Elettra synchrotron in Trieste, Italy. This method, called “edge-illumination”, operates a fine selection on the X-ray direction by using the physical edge of the detector pixels themselves, hence the name. Later on Olivo, in collaboration with Robert <b>Speller</b> at University College London, adapted the method for use with conventional X-ray sources, opening the way to translation into clinical and other applications. Peter Munro (from the University of Western Australia) substantially contributed to the development of the lab-based approach, by demonstrating that it imposes practically no coherence requirements and that, this notwithstanding, it still is fully quantitative.|$|E
500|$|The {{spelling}} bee competition began in 1925, and {{was organized by}} The Courier-Journal in Louisville, Kentucky, until the Scripps Howard Broadcasting Company assumed sponsorship in 1941. The media conglomerate, {{now known as the}} E. W. Scripps Company, has continued to sponsor the competition to this date. The competition was canceled from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. Every <b>speller</b> in the competition has previously participated in a local {{spelling bee}}, usually organized by a local newspaper. Although the competition is titled [...] "National", spellers from Europe, Canada, New Zealand, Guam, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa have entered the competition. Only two people from outside the fifty U.S. states have won the competition [...] the first from Puerto Rico in 1975 and the second from Jamaica in 1998.|$|E
500|$|All {{the regular}} first-team members during the {{previous}} season [...] goalkeepers Chris Charsley and George Hollis, backs Tom Bayley and Fred <b>Speller,</b> half-backs Ted Devey, Caesar Jenkyns and Billy Ollis, and forwards Jack Hallam, Tommy Hands, Harry Morris, Billy Walton and Fred Wheldon [...] remained with the club. Others from the Football Alliance side included the versatile Bernard Pumfrey and George Short, and the long-serving Charlie Simms, who was by 1892 employed as the first-team trainer, but retained his playing registration for emergencies. Among the newcomers were back Fred Jones from Newton Heath, forward Harry Edwards, signed from Singer's of Coventry, and centre-forward Frank Mobley, who joined soon {{after the start of}} the season, also from Singer's. They played in the same kit as in the previous season: royal blue shirts and stockings with white knickerbockers.|$|E
5000|$|There were 248 <b>spellers</b> this year. 138 <b>spellers</b> were {{eliminated}} {{in the first}} day of competition. The first place prize was $10,000, followed by $5000 for second, and $3000 for third place.|$|R
5000|$|There were 174 {{participants}} {{this year}} (100 girls and 74 boys, ages 9-14), {{and a total}} of 725 words used. [...] Nine <b>spellers</b> missed in the first round, 36 in the second, and 14 in the third. [...] 115 <b>spellers</b> made it to day two of the competition, and the final round between the last two <b>spellers</b> began at about 4:40pm. [...] Alex Cameron was the prounouncer.|$|R
50|$|Then the <b>spellers</b> {{receive a}} letter, {{whether it would}} be picking a token out of a bag, {{cracking}} a dinosaur egg to collect the token, grabbing a lollipop with a token on it, or finding it inside a bag attached to the <b>speller's</b> instrument. The tokens are either red or blue and has a letter spelt from A to {{all the way to the}} last letter depending of the number of <b>spellers</b> left. The <b>spellers</b> are then arranged in two lines: blue on one side, red on the other and in order of A, B, C and so on.|$|R
