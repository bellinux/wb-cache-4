50|$|Currently, the Rutland - Southern Vermont Regional Airport Technical Advisory Committee {{is proposing}} a 1000 ft runway {{extension}} {{to alleviate the}} constraints posed by the current main runway length and the limited road access to the region. In its current configuration, the main runway is severely limiting to charters, business jets, and 50+ passenger regional jets. Part 91 <b>Subpart</b> <b>K,</b> imposed by the FAA on fractional jet operators in 2005 has reduced runway planning performance by 40 percent.|$|E

B. NEED FOR ACTION Greater and lesser (and Canadian) sandhill cranes are presently hunted in other parts of their range and have been divided into management populations based on their geographic distribution during fall and winter. The Eastern Population (EP) of sandhill cranes {{is the subject of this}} proposed action. The Atlantic and Mississippi Flyway Councils recently completed a Management Plan for the Eastern Population of Sandhill Cranes (hereafter called the Management Plan; Van Horn et al. 2010). The Management Plan allows for hunting of this population when the three-year average of the USFWS-coordinated fall population survey exceeds 30, 000 cranes. This population level has now been reached and exceeded with latest 3 -year average indicating 51, 217 cranes (Fig. 1). This environmental assessment considers the action to institute a limited harvest of sandhill cranes from the EP by reviewing current management strategies and population objectives, and examining alternatives to current management programs...|$|E
