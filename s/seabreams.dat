The binding of 125 I-sGnRH-A to the <b>seabream</b> ovarian membrane preparation was saturable, displaceable, reversible, and dependent on time, temperature and tissue concentration. Addition of unlabeled s-GnRH-A displaced the radio-ligand in a dose-related manner, indicating the presence of one class of high-affinity binding sites with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 45. 5 +/- 6. 2 nM. Addition of other GnRH peptides, including salmon GnRH ([Trp 7,Leu 8]GnRH) and chicken GnRH-II ([His 5,Trp 7,Tyr 8]GnRH), also displaced 125 I-sGnRH-A; all these peptides bound with lower affinities than sGnRH-A to the <b>seabream</b> ovarian binding site.

30|$|Gilthead {{seabream}} escapes {{have been}} sporadically reported by fish farmers {{and they are}} usually related to cage net damages {{in the area of}} Malostonski Bay and Neretva estuary. The overall number of escapes from these farms is estimated to be 0.1  % of the purchased fry number after mortalities, based on the average weight of sold fish and the purchase records. However, we were able to locate at least one escape record of almost 2  t of 2 -year-old gilthead <b>seabreams</b> from one single cage in 2004 (estimated 9, 000 fish of 230 – 280  g). The origin of this batch of fish was a hatchery in France, according to an invoice document. Research on the genetic origin of the present wild gilthead seabream populations in Malostonski Bay and Neretva Estuary has revealed “French” origin and this proves that the increase of the population of wild gilthead <b>seabreams</b> in the area is contributed by escaped juveniles or adults from aquaculture farms (Šegvic-Bubic et al. 2011).|$|E
30|$|At {{the same}} time, at the Neretva Estuary, {{a total of}} 234 adult gilthead <b>seabreams</b> were caught by {{gillnets}} and long lines.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{provided}} {{information for the}} role of the RAS in <b>seabream</b> osmoregulatory responses. The structure of angiotensinogen suggested that flounder type Ang II was the prevalent form in <b>seabream.</b> However, HPLC analysis suggested that different forms of angiotensins were present in <b>seabream</b> adapted to different salinities. The status of RAS was revealed in <b>seabream</b> adapted to different salinities and a higher status was found in hypersaline environment. Local renal RAS was identified and it may be activated in hyposmotic media and associated with an increase in glomerular and tubular function to excrete excess water. In general, the RAS in <b>seabream</b> displays differential status, both at systemic and local levels, which modulates osmoregulatory functions under acute and chronic salinity perturbation. The renin angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in the control of body fluid homeostasis in silver <b>seabream.</b> <b>Seabream</b> angiotensinogen was cloned and sequenced in the present study. The sequence alignment showed that the angiotensinogen of <b>seabream</b> is most similar to that of pufferfish. Differential status of RAS was found among different salinities, with relatively higher RAS activity among hyperosmotic adapted <b>seabream.</b> Circulating angiotensin II (Ang II) was higher in hyperosmotic adapted <b>seabream,</b> with the highest value observed in <b>seabream</b> adapted to double-strength seawater. Although the level of immunoreactive angiotensins in freshwater adapted <b>seabream</b> was higher than that of brackish-water, Ang III, but not Ang II, was the prevalent circulating form in freshwater adapted <b>seabream</b> according to HPLC analysis. Hepatic angiotensinogen expression, however, did not show any statistical difference among different salinities. A positive feedback control for angiotensinogen by Ang II is present in the hepatic tissue of <b>seabream</b> as Ang II increased the expression of angiotensinogen in isolated hepatocyte but captopril lowered the angiotensinogen expression in intact fish. Branchial Na-K-ATPase activities were elevated by Ang II and the activities among different salinities showed a pattern similar to that of circulating angiotensins. However, upon abrupt hyposmotic transfer, branchial Na-K-ATPase elevated along with a decrease in circulating Ang II, an observation implying that the relationship between Na-K-ATPase and Ang II may only be causal. Captopril blockade not only lowered not only circulating Ang II levels but also that of cortisol, indicating RAS activity may limit cortisol secretion. An elevation in the circulating cortisol {{may be related to the}} increase in branchial Na-K-ATPase activities after abrupt hyposmotic transfer. The stimulatory effect on branchial Na-K-ATPase activity and the vasopressor effect of Ang II were more potent in hyposmotic than hyperosmotic adapted <b>seabream,</b> which indicates hyposmotic adapted <b>seabream</b> is more sensitive to RAS activation. The renal RAS in silver <b>seabream</b> functions independently from the systemic RAS as the pattern of renal angiotensins was dissimilar to that of systemic angiotensins. The renal RAS was activated in brackish water conditions and abrupt hyposmotic transfer significantly increased renal RAS activities. Kidney morphometrics also indicated that hyposmotic adaptation increase the filtering capacity of <b>seabream</b> nephrons. The number and diameter of glomeruli increase significantly in freshwater adapted <b>seabream,</b> which may vastly increase the filtering surface of the nephrons. Collecting tubules were more prevalent in the kidney of hyposmotic adapted <b>seabream,</b> with higher number, diameter and thickness, suggesting a lower water permeability of collecting tubules is essential for the formation of copious and diluted urine in hyposmotic environment.

40|$|In the Mediterranean, fishing bans {{generally}} {{allow the}} recovery of populations of sea urchin predators, such as the <b>seabreams</b> Diplodus sargus and D. vulgaris, promoting the transformation of overgrazed communities into ones dominated by erect macroalgae. However, in the marine reserve on Ustica Island (SW Italy) the opposite trend {{has occurred in the}} upper infralittoral community, and urchin barrens formed after the cessation of fishing activities. We hypothesized that (1) the natural scarcity of the 2 seabream species leads to a low predation rate on sea urchins at Ustica, and (2) predation rate varies with depth, due to differences in the predator assemblages. Tethering experiments were conducted to test these hypotheses by comparing the predation rates at different depths at Ustica and 2 other locations in Sicily characterized by erect macroalgae communities and low urchin densities. Differences in the assemblages of predators, relative vulnerability of the 2 species of sea urchin present (Paracentrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula), and sea urchin density were also assessed. Despite large variation in predator abundance among locations, {{there was no difference in}} predation rate on tethered urchins. Predation by fish was found to be higher in locations where <b>seabreams</b> were abundant, while predation by the starfish Marthasterias glacialis, usually considered a minor sea urchin predator, was found to be the major source of mortality at Ustica. The paucity of predatory fish at Ustica was consistent with the high abundances of urchins and persistence of barrens habitat. The high predation rate on urchins by M. glacialis at Ustica suggests that this species might play an important role in controlling urchin populations in the future...|$|E
40|$|Artificial reefs {{are used}} by many {{fisheries}} managers {{as a tool to}} mitigate the impact of fisheries on coastal fish communities by providing new habitat for many exploited fish species. However, the comparison between the behavior of wild fish inhabiting either natural or artificial habitats has received less attention. Thus the spatio-temporal patterns of fish that establish their home range in one habitat or the other and their consequences of intra-population differentiation on life-history remain largely unexplored. We hypothesize that individuals with a preferred habitat (i. e. natural vs. artificial) can behave differently in terms of habitat use, with important consequences on population dynamics (e. g. life-history, mortality, and reproductive success). Therefore, using biotelemetry, 98 white seabream (Diplodus sargus) inhabiting either artificial or natural habitats were tagged and their behavior was monitored for up to eight months. Most white <b>seabreams</b> were highly resident either on natural or artificial reefs, with a preference for the shallow artificial reef subsets. Connectivity between artificial and natural reefs was limited for resident individuals due to great inter-habitat distances. The temporal behavioral patterns of white <b>seabreams</b> differed between artificial and natural reefs. Artificial-reef resident fish had a predominantly nocturnal diel pattern, whereas natural-reef resident fish showed a diurnal diel pattern. Differences in diel behavioral patterns of white seabream inhabiting artificial and natural reefs could be the expression of realized individual specialization resulting from differences in habitat configuration and resource availability between these two habitats. Artificial reefs have the potential to modify not only seascape connectivity but also the individual behavioral patterns of fishes. Future management plans of coastal areas and fisheries resources, including artificial reef implementation, should therefore consider the potential effect of habitat modification on fish behavior, which could have key implications on fish dynamics. © 2013 Koeck et al.
