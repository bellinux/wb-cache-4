5|$|Havock began escorting supply convoys in June to Tobruk, Libya {{until the}} ship was damaged in October. She was {{repaired}} in time to escort a convoy to Malta during the First Battle of <b>Sirte</b> in December and was badly damaged by the Italian battleship Littorio whilst protecting another convoy during the Second Battle of <b>Sirte</b> in March 1942. Repairs were attempted in Malta, but {{the ship was}} further damaged in an air raid in early April. The Admiralty decided that further attempts to repair her at Malta were pointless and ordered her to Gibraltar for permanent repairs. On 6 April, while on passage to Gibraltar, Havock ran aground near Cape Bon, Tunisia, and her crew was interned by the Vichy French at Laghouat in the Sahara.|$|E
5|$|The last {{operations}} of 1941 were in December, when the LRDG twice ferried the SAS {{to and from}} raids on Axis airfields, attacking the airfields at <b>Sirte</b> (twice), El Agheila, Ajdabiya, Nofaliya and Tamit, and destroying 151 aircraft and 30 vehicles. During the second raid at <b>Sirte,</b> the SAS devised a new method of attacking parked aircraft. They drove the LRDG trucks between the rows of aircraft, which were then engaged by machine guns and hand grenades. Prior to this the procedure had been to quietly infiltrate an airfield and place Lewes bombs on aircraft and vehicles, leaving before the bombs exploded, but this attack was so successful that it became the preferred method for attacking airfields.|$|E
5|$|Gaddafi's {{earliest}} {{education was}} of a religious nature, imparted by a local Islamic teacher. Subsequently, moving to nearby <b>Sirte</b> to attend elementary school, he progressed through six grades in four years. Education in Libya was not free, but his father thought it would greatly benefit his son despite the financial strain. During the week Gaddafi slept in a mosque, and at weekends walked 20 miles to visit his parents. At school, Gaddafi was bullied for being a Bedouin, but {{was proud of his}} identity and encouraged pride in other Bedouin children. From <b>Sirte,</b> he and his family moved to the market town of Sabha in Fezzan, south-central Libya, where his father worked as a caretaker for a tribal leader while Muammar attended secondary school, something neither parent had done. Gaddafi was popular at this school; some friends made there received significant jobs in his later administration, most notably his best friend Abdul Salam Jalloud.|$|E
5|$|On 20 March 2011, USMC AV-8Bs were {{launched}} from USS Kearsarge {{in support of}} Operation Odyssey Dawn, enforcing the UN no-fly zone over Libya. They carried out airstrikes on <b>Sirte</b> on 5 April 2011. Multiple AV-8Bs {{were involved in the}} defense of a downed F-15E pilot, attacking approaching Libyans prior to the pilot's extraction by a MV-22 Osprey.|$|E
5|$|The LRDG now began {{a series}} of patrols behind the Axis lines. Near the end of July 'T' Patrol left for the desert to the south of the Gulf of <b>Sirte.</b> One 'T' Patrol truck managed to observe the main coastal road, along which Axis traffic was passing. They were {{followed}} two or three weeks later by 'S' Patrol, who carried out a similar reconnaissance between Jalo oasis and Agedabia. Both patrols returned safely to Kufra without being discovered. In August 1941 'R' Patrol relieved 'G' and 'Y' Patrols at Siwa and was joined by 'T' Patrol in October.|$|E
5|$|In the interwar period, the two cruisers {{served in}} the Cruiser Division, {{frequently}} alternating as the divisional flagship. Trento made two extensive trips abroad, {{the first was a}} tour of South American countries in mid to late-1929 and the second was a deployment to China to protect Italian nationals during the Chinese Civil War. In 1938, Trieste assisted in the repatriation of Italian volunteer soldiers who had fought in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Both ships saw extensive action in World War II, including the battles of Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan. Trieste was damaged by a British submarine in November 1941 and therefore missed the First and Second Battles of <b>Sirte,</b> where at the latter action Trento damaged a British destroyer.|$|E
5|$|The {{two ships}} entered service in 1916, and were based in Taranto {{with the rest}} of the main fleet for the {{duration}} of World War I. Both ships were involved in the Corfu incident in 1923. The ships' modernization work was completed after Italy entered World War II. Caio Duilio was damaged at the Battle of Taranto, while Andrea Doria was not hit. Both ships were present at the First Battle of <b>Sirte,</b> though only Andrea Doria engaged British forces. The two ships survived the war, and were the only battleships the Allies permitted Italy to retain after the conclusion of hostilities. They served in the Italian Navy for another decade until they were discarded in the mid-1950s.|$|E
5|$|The {{two ships}} were moored in Taranto {{on the night}} of 11/12 November 1940 when the British {{launched}} a carrier strike on the Italian fleet. In the resulting Battle of Taranto, Caio Duilio was hit by a torpedo and forced to beach to avoid sinking. Andrea Doria was undamaged in the raid; repairs for Caio Duilio lasted until May 1941. Both ships escorted convoys to North Africa in late 1941, including Operation M42, where Andrea Doria saw action at the inconclusive First Battle of <b>Sirte</b> on 17 December. Fuel shortages curtailed further activity in 1942 and 1943, and both ships were interned at Malta following Italy's surrender in September 1943. Italy was permitted to retain both battleships after the war, and they alternated as fleet flagship until the early 1950s, when they were removed from active service. Both ships were scrapped after 1956.|$|E
5|$|Wizard's {{descendants}} include 1963 Irish 2000 Guineas and 1964 Queen Elizabeth II Stakes winner Linacre and 1940 Gran Premio di Milano winner <b>Sirte.</b> Through 1948 Prix Edmond Blanc winner Menetrier he is {{an ancestor}} of multiple time Canadian Champion sire and Hall of Fame inductee Vice Regent and his brother Viceregal and their many descendants (which include Deputy Minister, Victory Gallop and Trempolino), as well as Canadian Horse of the Year Canebora and 1979 Prix du Jockey Club winner Top Ville. All these were descended through another unnamed daughter foaled in 1813, as was Hyacinthus, who won the 1940 Middle Park Stakes. This unnamed daughter of Wizard was never trained to race as she was crippled.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Doria saw {{no major}} action in World War I, and served {{extensively}} in Mediterranean in the 1920s and 1930s. She {{was involved in}} the suppression of rebels in Fiume and the Corfu incident in the 1920s. Starting in 1937, Andrea Doria underwent an extensive modernization, which lasted until 1940. She saw relatively little action during World War II; she was tasked with escorting convoys to Libya throughout 1941 and into 1942, during which she engaged in the inconclusive First Battle of <b>Sirte.</b> After the Armistice in September 1943 the ship was sailed to Malta and interned by the Allies. She remained there until 1944, when she was permitted to return to Italian ports. Andrea Doria survived the war and soldiered on in the post-war navy as a training ship until 1956. Paid off in September, she was formally stricken from the naval register on 1 November and sold for scrapping later that year.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{participated in}} the Battle of Calabria in July 1940, when Giulio Cesare was lightly damaged. They were both present when British torpedo bombers {{attacked}} the fleet at Taranto in November 1940, and Conte di Cavour was torpedoed. She was grounded with most of her hull underwater and her repairs were not completed before the Italian surrender in September 1943. Conte di Cavour was scrapped in 1946. Giulio Cesare escorted several convoys, and {{participated in the}} Battle of Cape Spartivento in late 1940 and the First Battle of <b>Sirte</b> in late 1941. She was designated as a training ship in early 1942, and escaped to Malta after Italy surrendered. The ship {{was transferred to the}} Soviet Union in 1949 and renamed Novorossiysk. The Soviets also used her for training until she was sunk when a mine exploded in 1955. She was scrapped in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Gaddafi {{transformed}} Libya {{into a new}} socialist state {{called a}} Jamahiriya ("state of the masses") in 1977. He officially adopted a symbolic role in governance but remained head of both {{the military and the}} Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing dissent. During the 1970s and 1980s, Libya's unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad, support for foreign militants, and alleged responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing left it increasingly isolated on the international stage. A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States, United Kingdom, and Israel, resulting in the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya and United Nations-imposed economic sanctions. From 1999, Gaddafi rejected Arab socialism and encouraged economic privatization, rapprochement with Western nations, and Pan-Africanism; he was Chairperson of the African Union from 2009â€“10. Amid the 2011 Arab Spring, protests against widespread corruption and unemployment broke out in eastern Libya. The situation descended into civil war, in which NATO intervened militarily {{on the side of the}} anti-Gaddafist National Transitional Council (NTC). The government was overthrown and Gaddafi retreated to <b>Sirte,</b> only to be captured and killed by NTC militants.|$|E
5|$|Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi {{was born}} near Qasr Abu Hadi, {{a rural area}} outside the town of <b>Sirte</b> in the deserts of Tripolitania, western Libya. His family came from a small, {{relatively}} uninfluential tribal group called the Qadhadhfa, who were Arabized Berber in heritage. His mother was named Aisha (died 1978), and his father, Mohammad Abdul Salam bin Hamed bin Mohammad, was known as Abu Meniar (died 1985); the latter earned a meagre subsistence as a goat and camel herder. Nomadic Bedouins were illiterate and kept no birth records. As such, Gaddafi's date of birth is not known with certainty, and sources have set it in 1942 or {{in the spring of}} 1943, although his biographers David Blundy and Andrew Lycett noted {{that it could have been}} pre-1940. His parents' only surviving son, he had three older sisters. Gaddafi's upbringing in Bedouin culture influenced his personal tastes for the rest of his life; he preferred the desert over the city and would retreat there to meditate.|$|E
5|$|Only a few {{towns in}} western Libyaâ€”such as Bani Walid, Sebha and Sirteâ€”remained Gaddafist strongholds. Retreating to <b>Sirte</b> after Tripoli's fall, Gaddafi {{announced}} {{his willingness to}} negotiate for a handover to a transitional government, a suggestion rejected by the NTC. Surrounding himself with bodyguards, he continually moved residences to escape NTC shelling, devoting his days to prayer and reading the Qur'an. On 20 October, Gaddafi broke out of Sirte's District 2 in a joint civilian-military convoy, hoping to take refuge in the Jarref Valley. At around 8.30am, NATO bombers attacked, destroying at least 14 vehicles and killing at least 53. The convoy scattered, and Gaddafi and those closest to him fled to a nearby villa, which was shelled by rebel militia from Misrata. Fleeing to a construction site, Gaddafi and his inner cohort hid inside drainage pipes while his bodyguards battled the rebels; in the conflict, Gaddafi suffered head injuries from a grenade blast while defence minister Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr was killed.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of 911 September, the British {{launched}} several air strikes on Messina, and Gorizia contributed her anti-aircraft batteries {{to the defense of}} the port. Later in the month, the British sent another convoy to reinforce Malta codenamed Operation Halberd; the Italian fleet sortied on 26 September to try to intercept it, but broke off the operation upon discovering the strength of the British escort force. On 29 September, upon returning from the failed attempt to disrupt Operation Halberd, Gorizia was sent to operate from La Maddalena, though she returned to Messina on 10 October. An Allied air attack on the port on 21 November caused extensive damage to Gorizias superstructure from bomb splinters, though she nevertheless sortied that day to escort another convoy to North Africa. On 16 and 17 December, while on another convoy escort mission, she took part in the First Battle of <b>Sirte</b> against a force of British light cruisers and destroyers.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after her}} commissioning, Littorio was badly damaged during the British air raid on Taranto on 11 November 1940, which put {{her out of}} action until the {{following}} March. Littorio thereafter took part in several sorties to catch the British Mediterranean Fleet, most of which failed to result in any action, the notable exception being the Second Battle of <b>Sirte</b> in March 1942, where she damaged several British warships. Littorio was renamed Italia in July 1943 {{after the fall of}} the Fascist government. On 9 September 1943, the Italian fleet was attacked by German bombers while it was on its way to internment. During this action, which saw the destruction of her sister , Italia herself was hit by a Fritz X radio-controlled bomb, causing significant damage to her bow. As part of the armistice agreement, Italia was interned at Malta, Alexandria, and finally in the Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal, where she remained until 1947. Italia was awarded to the United States as a war prize and scrapped at La Spezia in 195254.|$|E
5|$|The G- and H-class {{ships of}} the Mediterranean Fleet escorted {{numerous}} Malta convoys, {{participated in the}} Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941 and covered the evacuation of troops from Greece and Crete from Mayâ€“June, losing two to German bombers and another so badly damaged that she was later written off. By {{the end of the}} year, they had sunk three submarines, two Italian and one German. Three Hs participated in the Second Battle of <b>Sirte</b> in March 1942, during which one was damaged. Further damaged by aerial attacks, she was ordered to Gibraltar and ran aground in transit and had to be destroyed. Another was torpedoed and lost during Operation Vigorous in June. The ships sank two more submarines during 1942 and three destroyers began conversion to escort destroyers late that year and early in 1943. Two of the four surviving Gs and Hs were transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy while under conversion. All of the surviving ships joined their Havant half-sisters on escort duty in the North Atlantic in 1943.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} ships entered service in August 1940, shortly after Italy joined World War II. Littorio was badly damaged in the November 1940 raid on Taranto, and repairs lasted until March 1941. Vittorio Veneto was undamaged, and later that month {{took part in}} the Battle of Cape Spartivento. In March 1941, she was damaged by British torpedo bombers after the {{inconclusive}} Battle of Cape Matapan. Both ships were back in action for the First and Second Battle of <b>Sirte</b> in January and March 1942, respectively. By the end of the year, Roma was ready for service and replaced Littorio as the fleet flagship. After Benito Mussolini fell from power in July 1943, Littorio was renamed Italia. During the Italian surrender in September 1943, Roma was hit by a pair of Fritz-X guided glide bombs; her ammunition magazines blew up in a tremendous explosion and she quickly sank. Italia was hit by one Fritz-X and was badly damaged. The United States and Britain received Italia and Vittorio Veneto, respectively, in the peace treaty; both ships were scrapped in the late 1940s, as was the incomplete Impero.|$|E
5|$|The ship saw {{extensive}} {{service in}} World War II, which Italy entered in June 1940. She frequently operated against British convoys to Malta in the Mediterranean, {{and after the}} North African Campaign began, she escorted Italian convoys to support the Italo-German forces fighting there. In the course of these operations, she {{took part in the}} battles at Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and First and Second <b>Sirte.</b> Gorizia was also attacked numerous times by Allied bombers while in port, culminating in a major raid in April 1943 that inflicted serious damage to the ship. Under repair when Italy surrendered to the Allies in September, the ship was seized by occupying Germany forces, who found the ship to be unusable and so abandoned her. Italian and British frogmen tried unsuccessfully to sink the ship in 1944. After Germany's defeat in 1945, the Italian Navy determined the ship was beyond economical repair, and so she was broken up for scrap in 1947.|$|E
5|$|The three ships {{had limited}} careers during World War I, {{and did not}} see action. On the night of 2/3 August 1916, Leonardo da Vinci was sunk by an {{internal}} explosion. She was raised in 1919; the navy planned to repair and modernize her, but lacked sufficient funds, and she was sold in 1923. The two surviving ships were heavily rebuilt in the mid-1930s, and both saw action during World War II. On the night of 11/12 November 1940, both ships were attacked by British torpedo bombers in the Battle of Taranto. Conti di Cavour was badly damaged, and had not been fully repaired when Italy surrendered in September 1943. Giulio Cesare meanwhile escaped unscathed, and participated in the battles of Cape Spartivento and First <b>Sirte</b> in November 1940 and December 1941, respectively. After {{the end of the}} war, Conti di Cavour was scrapped, and Giulio Cesare was surrendered to the Soviet Union. Renamed Novorossiysk, she was ultimately sunk in October 1955 by an old German mine left over from World War II. Her wreck was later salvaged in 1957 and broken up thereafter.|$|E
5|$|While in Messina on 25 January 1942, {{the ship}} was visited by the German Luftwaffe officer Generaloberst Bruno Loerzer, who had arrived to command German air units {{stationed}} on the island. Five days later, Umberto II, the crown prince of Italy, and Hermann GÃ¶ring, {{the commander of the}} Luftwaffe, visited the ship on a tour of major bases in Sicily. Gorizia returned to combat operations in February; she sortied on the 14th to search for Allied shipping, but instead came under heavy attack from both torpedo bombers and submarines. She returned to Messina undamaged. On 21 February, she joined another convoy to Tripoli before returning to Messina on the 24th. A month later, on 22 March, she took part in the Second Battle of <b>Sirte,</b> where she was heavily engaged with British light cruisers and destroyers. The engagement occurred at long range, and smoke from the British ships interfered with the Italians' gunnery, and Gorizia scored no hits. In the course of the battle, she had fired 226 rounds from her main battery.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the new US President Ronald Reagan {{pursued a}} hard line {{approach}} to Libya, erroneously claiming it to be puppet regime of the Soviet Union. In turn, Gaddafi played up his commercial relationship with the Soviets, visiting Moscow again in April 1981 and 1985, and in 1978 threatening to join the Warsaw Pact. The Soviets were nevertheless cautious of Gaddafi, seeing him as an unpredictable extremist. Beginning military exercises in the Gulf of <b>Sirte</b> â€“ an area of sea that Libya claimed {{as a part of}} its territorial waters â€“ in August 1981 the US shot down two Libyan Su-22 planes monitoring them. Closing down Libya's embassy in Washington, D.C., Reagan advised US companies operating in the country {{to reduce the number of}} American personnel stationed there. In March 1982, the US implemented an embargo of Libyan oil, and in January 1986 ordered all US companies to cease operating in the country, although several hundred workers remained when the Libyan government doubled their pay. Diplomatic relations also broke down with the UK, after Libyan diplomats were accused in the killing of Yvonne Fletcher, a British policewoman stationed outside their London embassy, in April 1984. In Spring 1986, the US Navy again began performing exercises in the Gulf of Sirte; the Libyan military retaliated, but failed as the US sank several Libyan ships.|$|E
5|$|In December 1941, Andrea Doria formed part of {{the escort}} during Operation M41, a major convoy from Italy to Benghazi in Libya on the 13th. M42 {{followed}} on 1719 December, where Andrea Doria saw action against British cruisers and destroyers in the First Battle of <b>Sirte.</b> Late on the 17th, the Italian fleet, commanded by Admiral Angelo Iachino, engaged the British light forces. Both sides acted hesitantly, however, and no decisive engagement resulted. Operation M43 followed on 3 January 1942; Andrea Doria again provided escort for the three convoys to Libya. While on the operation, Andrea Doria suffered mechanical problems and {{had to return to}} port early. She remained inactive {{for the remainder of the}} year, and indeed until the Armistice in September 1943 that removed Italy from the war, owing to severe fuel shortages in the Italian Navy. On 9 September 1943, Andrea Doria left Italy, bound for internment in Malta, where she remained until 8 June 1944. She was then released to return to Sicily, and eventually returned to Taranto on 14 March 1945. After the war ended in May 1945, Andrea Doria went to Syracuse, where she remained until 13 December 1949. She was then made flagship of the Italian fleet, a role she performed until 9 December 1950. She held the position again from 9 March 1951 to May 1953, after which time she was used as a gunnery training ship. She was paid off on 16 September 1956, after serving in the Italian Navy for over 40 years. She was formally stricken from the naval register on 1 November and subsequently broken up for scrap in La Spezia.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Andrea Doria {{participated in}} several {{operations}} intended to catch British convoys in the Mediterranean, including the Operation Excess convoys in January 1941. By {{the end of}} the year, both battleships were tasked with escorting convoys from Italy to North Africa to support the Italian and German forces fighting there. These convoys included Operation M41 on 13 December and Operation M42 on 17â€“19 December. During the latter, Andrea Doria and Giulio Cesare engaged British cruisers and destroyers in the First Battle of <b>Sirte</b> {{on the first day of}} the operation. Neither the Italians nor the British pressed their attacks and the battle ended inconclusively. Caio Duilio was assigned to distant support for the operation, and was too far away to actively participate in the battle. Convoy escort work continued into early 1942, but thereafter the fleet began to suffer from a severe shortage of fuel, which kept the ships in port for the next two years. Caio Duilio sailed away from Taranto on 14 February with a pair of light cruisers and seven destroyers in order to intercept the British convoy MW 9, bounded from Alexandria to Malta, but the force could not locate the British ships, and so returned to port. After learning of Caio Duilio departure, however, British escorts scuttled the transport Rowallan Castle, previously disabled by German aircraft.|$|E
25|$|On March 14, pro-Dawn forces {{associated}} with Misrata and Operation Sunrise clashed with IS militants in <b>Sirte.</b> Fighting between Libya Dawn forces and ISIL militants was also {{reported in the}} Daheera area west {{of the city of}} <b>Sirte,</b> and at the Harawa vicinity east of <b>Sirte.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Sirte</b> was liberated by GNA {{forces in}} early December; on 20 December 2016, ABC news {{reported}} that AFRICOM {{said that it}} carried out 495 airstrikes against militant vehicles and positions in the former IS stronghold of <b>Sirte,</b> Operation Odyssey Lightning concluded on 19 December, following an announcement from the Libyan government {{of the end of}} offensive military operations in <b>Sirte.</b>|$|E
25|$|The First Battle of <b>Sirte</b> {{was fought}} between the British Royal Navy and the Regia Marina (Italian Royal Navy) during the Mediterranean {{campaign}} of the Second World War. The engagement, largely uneventful, {{took place on}} 17 December 1941, south-east of Malta, in the Gulf of <b>Sirte.</b>|$|E
25|$|On August 14, {{multiple}} airstrikes {{were conducted}} on <b>Sirte</b> after the massacre committed by ISIL. The air assault lasted {{for half an hour}} targeting multiple areas in <b>Sirte</b> including the townâ€™s internal security complex, the Ouagadougou Conference centre, part of the university campus and the Mahari hotel.|$|E
25|$|On April 24, {{aircraft}} {{associated with}} the Tripoli-based government struck ISIL targets in <b>Sirte.</b>|$|E
25|$|In early February 2015, ISIL {{militants in}} Libya managed to capture {{part of the}} {{countryside}} {{to the west of}} Sabha, and later, an area encompassing the cities of <b>Sirte,</b> Nofolia, and a military base to the south of both cities. By March, ISIL had captured additional territory, including a city to the west of Derna, additional areas near <b>Sirte,</b> a stretch of land in southern Libya, some areas around Benghazi, and an area to the east of Tripoli.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the nine}} actions, four were British and three were Axis successes; two of them, {{including}} the First Battle of <b>Sirte,</b> were inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|On August 1, the United States {{air forces}} led air strikes (co-ordinated with the unity {{government}} in Tripoli) against ISIL positions in <b>Sirte.</b>|$|E
25|$|In June, clashes {{continued}} in <b>Sirte</b> {{between the military}} forces of the Government of National Accord and IS. Fighting on June 21 left 36 dead and 100 wounded, with sectors of the 700 district being cleared of snipers and with the broadcasting and electrical company headquarters being captured by government forces. According to reports, Colonel Al-Mahdi Al-Barghathi, the government's minister of defense, is personally overseeing the operation to take <b>Sirte,</b> and British and French special forces are fighting alongside the Libyan loyalist army units to retake the city.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sirte</b> was {{declared}} {{to be cleared}} of ISIL loyalists on December 6 after over 6 months of fighting, depriving the group of their remaining urban stronghold in Libya.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{creating}} the AU was revived in the mid-1990s {{under the leadership of}} Libyan head of state Muammar al-Gaddafi: the heads of state and government of the OAU issued the <b>Sirte</b> Declaration (named after <b>Sirte,</b> in Libya) on 9 September 1999, calling for the establishment of an African Union. The Declaration was followed by summits at LomÃ© in 2000, when the Constitutive Act of the African Union was adopted, and at Lusaka in 2001, when the plan for the implementation of the African Union was adopted. During the same period, the initiative for the establishment of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), was also established.|$|E
25|$|On 1 August 2016, U.S. crewed and uncrewed {{aircraft}} {{carried out}} airstrikes on IS targets in Libya, {{responding to the}} U.N.-backed government's request to help push the militants from their former stronghold of <b>Sirte</b> (where several hundred IS fighters remain), in what U.S. officials described as {{the start of a}} sustained campaign against the extremist group in the city. President Barack Obama authorized the airstrikes after a recommendation by U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter; the strikes hit an IS tank and two vehicles that posed a threat to forces aligned with Libyan GNA (Government of National Accord). This was the third U.S. air strike against Islamic State militants in Libya, but this time U.S. officials said it marked the start of a sustained air campaign rather than another isolated strike, U.S. airstrikes will continue to target ISIL in <b>Sirte</b> in order to enable the GNA to make a decisive, strategic advance. U.S. AFRICOM command is overseeing the US effort, which is known as Operation Odyssey Lightning, AV-8B Harrier II assigned to the 22nd MEU flying off the USS Wasp conducted the airstrikes and uncrewed aircraft launched from undisclosed locations. Airstrikes continued, on 2 August, airstrikes hit a rocket launcher, an excavator and a pickup truck with a mounted recoilless rifle and on 3 August airstrikes struck a pickup truck with a mounted recoilless rifle; by 9 August the U.S. conducted 28 strikes against ISIS in Libya, with {{more than half of the}} strikes being conducted from uncrewed aircraft. By 16 August, U.S. airstrikes hit an IS vehicle and 4 militant positions in <b>Sirte,</b> bringing the number of U.S. airstrikes in Libya to 48. On 17 August, U.S. Africa Command officials announced on 16 August airstrikes on ISIS targets in <b>Sirte</b> struck 7 enemy fighting positions, 4 vehicle-borne bombs, 1 pickup truck with a mounted recoilless rifle, 12 enemy fighting positions and 1 command-and-control vehicle, bringing the total number of airstrikes in support of Operation Odyssey Lightning to 57. On 22 August, Stars and Stripes reported that U.S. Marine AH-1W SuperCobra helicopters participated in strikes against IS militants in <b>Sirte</b> on 20 and 21 August; a small detachment of US special forces in <b>Sirte</b> provided most of the targeting information for the airstrikes which were then relayed to U.S. forces through Libyan government troops. On 31 August, Stars and Stripes reported that in the past month, the U.S. military conducted 104 airstrikes against IS targets in Libya.|$|E
