40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} base <b>station</b> <b>user</b> association and resources allocation (BUA-RA) in OFDM-TDMA-based broadband wireless access (BWA) networks under PON-WiMAX integration. With the powerful coordination capability at the optical line terminal (OLT), a key technology of inter-cell collaborative transmission (CT) is incorporated in the integrated network architecture, which is so called cooperative PON-WiMAX network (CPWN). To achieve an efficient integration and inter-cell CT in the CPWNs, BUA-RA {{is critical to the}} Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning for each user. In order to minimize the network resource usage, we provide three new BUA-RA schemes, which can be adaptively applied according to the network loads and wireless users ’ moving speeds. Simulations are conducted to verify the proposed BUA-RA schemes by comparing with those without CT technology and to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed mathematical formulations and linearization approach...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to adapt and {{evaluate}} the performance of two classical pilot-aided channel estimation schemes designed for OFDM systems: least square and minimum mean square error, in a relay-assisted scenario. We consider the Amplify-and-Forward, which is the simplest relay protocol for cooperative systems. Also, we consider the use of a single antenna at all the terminals: base <b>station,</b> <b>user</b> terminal and relay node. In our scenario, it is assumed that some of the user terminals deployed in a certain area could act as relaying-able terminals for the communications of other users.

Several position estimation and fusion algorithms are developed {{for use with}} the Autonomous Flight Systems Laboratory (AFSL) TRansponder based Position Information System (TRAPIS) software. At the lowest level, these estimation and fusion algorithms use raw information from ADS-B and LAMS data streams to provide aircraft position estimates to the ground <b>station</b> <b>user.</b> At the highest level, aircraft position is estimated using a discrete time Kalman filter with real-time covariance updates and fusion involving weighted averaging of ADS-B and LAMS positions.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, Liu et al. [281] propose a {{self-learning}} call admission control mechanism for Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) cellular networks that have both voice and data services. Their admission control mechanism is built atop a novel learning control architecture (e.g., adaptive critic design) that {{has only one}} controller module, namely, a critic network. The critic network is trained with an 3 : 6 : 1 MLP-NN that uses inputs such as network environment (e.g. total interference received at the base <b>station),</b> <b>user</b> behavior (e.g. call type—new or hand off call), call class (e.g. voice, data), and the action to accept or reject calls. The output is the Grade of Service (GoS) measure. The MLP-NN is retrained to adapt {{to changes in the}} admission control requirements, user behaviors and usage patterns, and the underlying network itself. Through simulation of cellular networks with two classes of services, the authors demonstrate that their admission control mechanism outperforms non-adaptive admission control mechanisms, with respect to GoS, in CDMA cellular networks.|$|E
