Eleven audio applications were compared with BIAS Peak Pro 5 in terms of <b>sample</b> <b>rate</b> conversion quality. A set of test signals was converted with all applications and spectral analysis was performed to detect artifacts in the converted signals. Results consistently show that the SRC algorithm in Peak Pro 5 provides topquality conversion in today’s market.

25|$|Bitrate is {{the product}} of the sample rate and number of bits per sample used to encode the music. CD audio is 44100 samples per second. The number of bits per sample also depends on the number of audio channels. CD is stereo and 16 bits per channel. So, {{multiplying}} 44100 by 32 gives 1411200—the bitrate of uncompressed CD digital audio. MP3 was designed to encode this 1411kbit/s data at 320kbit/s or less. As less complex passages are detected by MP3 algorithms then lower bitrates may be employed. When using MPEG-2 instead of MPEG-1, MP3 supports only lower <b>sampling</b> <b>rates</b> (16000, 22050 or 24000 samples per second) and offers choices of bitrate as low as 8kbit/s but no higher than 160kbit/s. By lowering the sampling rate, MPEG-2 layer III removes all frequencies above half the new sampling rate that may have been present in the source audio.|$|E
25|$|MPEG-2 doubles {{the number}} of <b>sampling</b> <b>rates</b> which are {{supported}} and MPEG-2.5 adds 3 more. When this was written, the suggested implementations were quite dated. Implementers of the standard were supposed to devise their own algorithms suitable for removing parts of {{the information from the}} audio input. As a result, many different MP3 encoders became available, each producing files of differing quality. Comparisons were widely available, so it was easy for a prospective user of an encoder to research the best choice. Some encoders that were proficient at encoding at higher bit rates (such as LAME) were not necessarily as good at lower bit rates. Over time, LAME evolved on the SourceForge website until it became the de facto CBR MP3 encoder. Later an ABR mode was added. Work progressed on true variable bit rate using a quality goal between 0 and 10. Eventually numbers (such as -V 9.600) could generate excellent quality low bit rate voice encoding at only 41kbit/s using the MPEG-2.5 extensions.|$|E

[...] This extension was developed at Fraunhofer IIS, the registered patent holders of MP3 by reducing the frame sync field in the MP3 header from 12 to 11 bits.
