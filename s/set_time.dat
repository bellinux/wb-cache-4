40|$|ABSTRACT. While {{concreting}} in hot weather, both <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> and {{compressive strength}} are adversely affected. To prevent concrete from {{the adverse effects}} of hot weather, admixtures are usually incorporated in it. The objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate the effects of a retarding admixture (ASTM C 494 Type D) on <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> of cement pastes. The <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> tests were performed under three different curing conditions (temperature & relative humidity). The admixture was added to pastes made from three different types of cements. The test results revealed that the effects of admixture on <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> of cement pastes are dependent upon the type of cement and dosage of the admixture. It caused set retardation of the three different types of cements used, but with one type of cement it accelerated, the initial <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> and retarded the final <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> when dosages higher than 0. 25 % were used...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The <b>setting</b> <b>times</b> of {{commercial}} mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and Portland cements vary. It {{was hypothesized that}} much of this variation was caused by differences in particle size distribution. Methods: Two gram samples from 11 MTA-type cements were analyzed by laser diffraction to determine their particle size distributions characterized by their percentile equivalent diameters (the 10 th percentile, the median, and the 90 th percentile [d 90], respectively). <b>Setting</b> <b>time</b> data were received from manufacturers who performed indentation <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> tests as specified by the standards relevant to dentistry, ISO 6786 (9 respondents) or ISO 9917. 1 (1 respondent), or not divulged to the authors (1 respondent). In a parallel experiment, 6 samples of different size graded Portland cements were produced using the same cement clinker. The measurement of <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> for Portland cement pastes was performed using American Society for Testing and Materials C 191. Cumulative heat release was measured using isothermal calorimetry to assess the reactions occurring during the setting of these pastes. In all experiments, linear correlations were assessed between <b>setting</b> <b>times,</b> heat release, and the 3 particle size parameters. Results: Particle size varied considerably among MTA cements. For MTA cements, d 90 was the particle size characteristic showing the highest positive linear correlation with <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> (r = 0. 538). For Portland cement, d 90 gave an even higher linear correlation for the initial <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> (r = 0. 804) and the final <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> (r = 0. 873) and exhibited a strong negative linear correlation for cumulative heat release (r = 0. 901). Conclusions: Smaller particle sizes result in faster <b>setting</b> <b>times,</b> with d 90 (the largest particles) being most closely correlated with the <b>setting</b> <b>times</b> of the samples...|$|R
5|$|The Thousand-Year Door {{contains}} several characters, {{the majority}} of whom are not playable. Progression in the game is sometimes dependent on interaction with non-player characters, although many {{are used in the}} game's various subquests. In particular, the Goomba Professor Frankly, who knows the most about the mysteries relating to Rogueport, must be visited every time Mario retrieves a Crystal Star. The game continues the tradition of Paper Mario, in which Mario can be accompanied by one assistant character at a <b>set</b> <b>time.</b> There are seven party members in total: Goombella the Goomba, Koops the Koopa, Madame Flurrie the wind spirit, a Yoshi (named by the player), Vivian the Shadow Siren, Admiral Bobbery the Bob-omb, and Ms. Mowz, who is available as an optional character.|$|E
5|$|Alyssa {{is given}} no {{weaponry}} during {{the majority of}} the game, other than a limited supply of holy water, which can be used to temporarily stun pursuing Subordinates. Within each level, the Subordinate can appear in any location after a set period of time, but also randomly or if Alyssa makes noise. They also appear in certain set locations. When one appears, it immediately begins to chase Alyssa, attempting to kill her. The player must either hide from or evade it. Evasion can only be accomplished in certain places, and each evasion point can only be used once. Using an evasion point does not kill the Subordinate, but instead renders them unconscious for a <b>set</b> <b>time.</b> The primary means of eluding one, however, is by hiding. There are multiple hiding points throughout each level, and each one can be used multiple times. However, hiding places are ineffective if the Subordinate sees Alyssa enter them.|$|E
5|$|Each Civilization in The Age of Kings has {{one or two}} special {{units that}} are {{exclusive}} to that Civilization. For instance, the Britons have access to longbowmen, an archery unit with increased range. These Civilization-specific units are generally more powerful, but still follow the basic rock-paper-scissors model. The monk is {{a special kind of}} military unit that has the ability to convert enemy units to the player's civilization, and to heal allied units. Monks are also used to collect relics; relics accumulate gold once held in the player's monastery—the more relics are captured, the faster the gold is accumulated. Collecting all relics on the map is one method by which a player can win a random map game, depending on the victory setting. Once a player has all in their monasteries, a timer is shown to all players. If an opposing player does not destroy a monastery holding a relic after the <b>set</b> <b>time,</b> then that player wins.|$|E
30|$|According to Habel et al. (2006), the <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> of UHPC {{is defined}} as “the time when the mixture attains a {{stiffness}} of 1000  MPa (145  ksi) and autogenous shrinkage initiates”. In another study, Graybeal (2006) defined the initial <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> as “a penetration resistance of 3.45  MPa (0.5  ksi) at 15  h after casting” and the final <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> as “a penetration resistance of 27.60  MPa (4  ksi) at about 18 – 20  h after casting” based on AASHTO T 197 (2000). Generally, the reported <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> of UHPC ranged from 6 to 12  h depending on the mixture design (Richard and Cheyrezy 1995; Yoo et al. 2013; Kazemi and Lubell 2012). However, some studies (Brown 2006; Graybeal 2007; Habel 2004; Morin et al. 2001) showed that the <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> for UHPC can be delayed for up to 30 – 40  h due to the set retarding effect of high SP dosage. Furthermore, {{it was observed that}} surface covering of freshly mixed UHPC delayed its <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> (Yoo et al. 2013).|$|R

5|$|Grabbed by the Ghoulies is a 3D action-adventure {{game with}} {{platforming}} elements. Breaking with {{the style of}} previous Rare platformers, the gameplay is simple in design, utilising the premise of moving through areas of the game's mansion and completing the required beat 'em up challenges in each room. Such challenges include eliminating all ghouls in a room, beating only a specified kind of ghoul while avoiding eliminating the rest or defeating a boss before the player-character, Cooper, can continue. All combat and melee attacks are manoeuvred by the control sticks, whereas the game's camera can be rotated by both triggers. When the player fails a challenge or takes longer than a <b>set</b> <b>time</b> limit to complete one, the Grim Reaper chases after the player-character; the Reaper will rip out Cooper's soul if the character does not leave the room in time. Standard enemies in the game include zombies, mummies, imps, skeletons and zombie pirates. There are also various bosses that must be defeated in order to advance. Many objects in the game with which the character can interact—including chairs, knives, and axes—can be used as weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Lightning Returns battle system {{originated}} while ideas were being discussed for the battle system in Final Fantasy XIII, but technical limitations and problems implementing it in a party-based battle system prevented {{it from being}} used in that game. It reemerged {{when some of the}} development team wanted Lightning to change her appearance during battle, and reducing to one playable character opened up the memory space necessary for such a system to be implemented. In making the system revolve around one character, the developers ended up removing any opportunity for story scenes between party members, which was cited by Abe as its main weakness. The time limit sprang from the story concept of a world with a <b>set</b> <b>time</b> to live. When the feature was first announced, there were some who felt it was too new a thing, as a time limit was seen as a taboo in role-playing video games. The mechanic originally received negative feedback from test players who were unable to complete the game in time. In response to this, the team made adjustments so that players were given a more comfortable amount of time. Along with sharing design elements with the previous two XIII games, the system also bears similarities to the battle system of Final Fantasy XV, although the developers said that they were not directly inspired by it.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules that}} can be used in a match vary {{depending}} on the game, but the most commonly used settings across all games are Time and Stock. Time mode uses a point based system in which fighters earn points for knocking out their opponents and lose points for being knocked out or self-destructing (i.e. falling out of the arena by themselves). The player with the highest score at the end of the <b>set</b> <b>time</b> limit wins the match. Survival uses a life-based system in which players are given a set number of lives, known as stock, with each fighter losing a life whenever they are knocked out, becoming eliminated if they run out of lives. The winner is the last fighter standing once all other fighters are eliminated or, if a time-limit is applied to the match, the fighter with the most lives remaining once time runs out. In the event of a tie, such as two or more fighters sharing the highest score/life count at the end of the time limit or remaining fighters losing their last life simultaneously, a Sudden Death match takes place. Here, each of the tied fighters are given a starting damage percentage of 300%, making them easier to launch off the stage, and the last fighter standing wins the match. In some games this process is repeated if the match ends in another tie.|$|E
30|$|For {{the setting}} {{property}} of concrete, it was identified that the <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> {{depends on the}} binder conditions and was particularly high for the CBF mixture.

Moreover, the initial and final time of the OPC and LHC mixtures were delayed when adding PCM.|$|R
40|$|Addition {{silicone}} impression {{materials have}} been used as impression material for more than 20 years. Although they are among the most expensive impression materials, they became popular during the past decade as they have excellent physical properties. Prevention of infection is an important aspect in dental treatment since dental professionals are routinely exposed to the wide variety of microorganisms present in saliva. Gloves are the most common protective measure used during dental treatment. The gloves are mostly made of latex. In this study, we examine how the <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> of three types polyvinyl putty materials were affected by the use of five different brands of latex gloves and one brand of vinyl gloves. Each material was first mixed without wearing gloves according to the manufacturer′s instructions. After the stipulated mixing <b>time,</b> the <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> was measured using the Vicat needle. The <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> is measured from the time of mixing till the time that the needle does not produce any indentation {{on the surface of the}} material. The putty material was then mixed with gloved hands (using the five different brands of latex gloves in turn) and the <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> was measured. Then the material was mixed with washed gloved hands, and the <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> was measured again. Finally, the material was mixed with vinyl gloved hands and the <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> was measured. The following conclusions were drawn from the study: Reprosil™ and Express™ showed significant variation in the <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> with the latex gloved hands.

The initial and final <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> of the alternative cementitious material is measured to be 242  ±  6 and 528  ±  5  min, respectively. Whereas, the initial and final <b>setting</b> <b>time</b> of the ordinary Portland cement is measured to be 210  ±  5 and 300  ±  8  min, respectively (Jo et al. 2014 a).
