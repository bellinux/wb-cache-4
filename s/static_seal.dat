50|$|The {{head gasket}} {{is the most}} highly {{stressed}} <b>static</b> <b>seal</b> in an engine and {{was a source of}} considerable trouble in early years. The monobloc cylinder head forms both cylinder and head in one unit, thus avoiding the need for a seal.|$|E
50|$|The main {{function}} of the head is to enclose the pressure chamber from the other end. The head contains an integrated rod sealing arrangement or the option to accept a seal gland. The head {{is connected to the}} body by means of threading, bolts, or tie rod. A <b>static</b> <b>seal</b> / o-ring is used in between head and barrel.|$|E

Caps also perform as cylinder mounting components flange, cap trunnion, cap clevis. Cap size is determined based on the bending stress. A <b>static</b> <b>seal</b> / o-ring is used in between cap and barrel (except welded construction).|$|E

40|$|Leaking, {{friction}} and wear of seals are concerns for machine designers and users everywhere. Although perfect sealing {{may be the}} general aim, in practice, considering apparently identical seals in the same application, some may seal while some may not. This is due, at least in part, to surface-related random phenomena. Therefore, the importance of considering the reliability of sealed joints cannot be overemphasized. Up to now, there is no paper in the published literature about the reliability analysis of <b>static</b> <b>sealed</b> joints. All of these facts provide the motivation for the current research work. A computer simulation model for the leakage analysis of <b>static</b> <b>sealed</b> joints has been developed based on the percolation theory. The features of the leakage simulation model can be concluded as follows: (1) It reveals the effect of random properties of rough surfaces on the sealing performance and {{makes it possible to}} apply the statistical concepts in discussing the <b>sealing</b> reliability of <b>static</b> <b>sealed</b> joints; (2) It provides much simpler and more economic tool for the statistical analysis of leakage by computer simulation than by experiments; (3) It makes it possible to describe the leakage phenomenon more accurately using the leakage path model instead of the clearance between surface centre-lines; (4) It eliminates the need for individual asperity model of rough surfaces, because the actual digitized surface is used directly. The relationship between the leakage probability and the applied load, which is of great general interest to the designers of <b>static</b> <b>sealed</b> joints, has been predicted by the leakage simulation model. The simulated results show that for a given leakage probability, the required load will increase as the value of RMS o height a increases or the value of correlation length decreases. It is confirmed that a certain value of contact ratio can be used as the criterion for identifying the reliability of <b>static</b> <b>sealed</b> joints with a certain confidence level. The contact ratio criterion provides a simple, inexpensive and useful tool to evaluate the effects of rough surfaces, material properties and applied load on the <b>sealing</b> reliability of <b>static</b> <b>sealed</b> joints. However, in order to be of practical use, experimental work is required to evaluate its validity...|$|R

50|$|The {{cylinder}} head is fitted with seals {{to prevent the}} pressurized oil from leaking past the interface between the rod and the head. This area is called the seal gland. The advantage of a seal gland is easy removal and seal replacement. The seal gland contains a primary seal, a secondary seal / buffer seal, bearing elements, wiper / scraper and <b>static</b> <b>seal.</b> In some cases, especially in small hydraulic cylinders, the rod gland and the bearing elements are made from a single integral machined part.|$|E
5000|$|The {{turbine blades}} expanded, however, {{contacting}} the honeycomb labyrinth seals {{and allowing the}} metal to scrape together when the engine overheated, with zero core rotation. When the engine is shut down at altitude, the core begins to cool, and the stator, including the static interstage <b>static</b> <b>seal</b> (ISS), contracts {{at a faster rate}} than the adjacent rotating parts in both the radial and axial direction because of its smaller thermal time constant. The relative rate of cooling of the stator and rotor results in an alignment of the rotating-seal knife edges aft of the normal operating groove in the <b>static</b> <b>seal.</b> If the clearances are tight enough and the relative cooling rates are right, contact can occur between the static and rotating seal elements. The resulting stiction can temporarily prevent the rotor from turning when only the force of ram air is applied to the core. Air turbine starter (ATS) torque has been shown adequate to overcome this restriction. Thus, when the engine cooled, the assembly did not match anymore, and the blades could not rotate freely. The crew ended the descent when they had reached 230 kn but neither engine core (N2) ever indicated any rotation during the entire descent. Since they were too high for an APU start, the ram air turbine (known as an [...] "air-driven generator" [...] on Bombardier products) was deployed to provide electric power for the aircraft, and the crew donned oxygen masks, as the cabin slowly depressurized due to loss of pressurization air from the engines.|$|E

In {{order to meet the}} <b>static</b> <b>seal</b> requirements of large gap in aviation, aerospace, metallurgy, and so on, we set up the experimental rig of magnetic fluid <b>static</b> <b>seal</b> and designed the <b>static</b> <b>seal</b> of magnetic fluid.

50|$|As {{well as a}} lubricant, {{vacuum grease}} is also used as a sealant for joints in vacuum systems.

The optimization is conducted by the zero-order method in ANSYS and water pressure experiments and bending experiments are carried out.|$|R
30|$|In {{cap rock}} research, most studies have {{concentrated}} on lithologic characterization, <b>static</b> <b>sealing</b> performance and mechanisms, or thickness and spatial distribution. Little has been published on dynamic cap rock evolution. Assessments of the sealing ability of the cover layer during the buried stage mainly correlate the porosity with the breakthrough pressure, only considering the effect of compaction on porosity. To consider only the rupture of rock caused by the change of formation, pressure in the uplift stage does not enable an accurate assessment of the sealing ability. For mechanistic studies on the microscopic sealing of different lithology covers, previous work has been conducted mostly on mudstone, with little attention to gypsum and dense carbonate rocks. For practical applications, more studies are required to investigate the relationships between different cover layers (regional cap rocks and direct cap rocks) {{and the distribution of}} oil and gas (Jin 2014).|$|R
