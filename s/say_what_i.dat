In an interview with The Buffalo News, Colbert said [...] "The weird thing about my character, even on the show, is sometimes I <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean. It doesn't matter {{to me that the}} audience doesn't know when that is." ...|$|E
500|$|Gallagher is {{well known}} for his controversial, outspoken {{statements}} in the press; he acknowledged his tendency for faux pas in the song [...] "My Big Mouth" [...] on the album Be Here Now. Yet Gallagher has defended himself, saying [...] "people think [...] controversial for the answers [...] give to silly questions in interviews, but... I'm not thinking about insulting... people; I <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> genuinely feel is in my heart. My conscience is clean, d'you know what I mean? Y'know, I'm true to myself—fuck everybody else." ...|$|E
500|$|Wagner {{had left}} neither a will, nor {{instruction}} on {{the management of}} the Bayreuth Festival after his death. He had written of the future: [...] "I ... cannot think of a single person who could <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> believe needs to be said ... there is practically no one on whose judgement I could rely". The festival's uncertain outlook was aggravated by Cosima's total withdrawal from all contact except that of her daughters and her friend and adviser Adolf von Groß. Without Cosima's participation the 1883 festival, as planned by Wagner—12 performances of Parsifal—went ahead, with Emil Scaria (who sang the role of Gurnemanz in the opera) doubling as artistic director. The cast was largely that of 1882, and Levi remained as conductor.|$|E

500|$|Bedingfield began {{recording}} {{her debut}} album in mid-2003, following {{the signing of}} a recording contract with Sony BMG earlier that year. She {{was determined not to}} be shaped into [...] "some music biz pigeonhole" [...] and wanted to write songs that were [...] "organic, different and real". Bedingfield began collaborating with Steve Kipner, Andrew Frampton and Wayne Wilkins in London and Los Angeles, but their sessions were largely unproductive due to Bedingfield's writer's block and the pressure that she felt to produce a hit song. Frustrated, she began to sing [...] "I love you, I love you, I love you" [...] over and over. She was at [...] "wit's end and just wanted to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> meant in a simple way, without using all those flowery words." [...] The line that Bedingfield sang out of frustration became the song's hook and its subject matter inspired by her real life difficulty writing a love song.|$|E
500|$|Christman {{contacted}} the Scientology critics based in Clearwater, and arranged flight transportation to Florida. She {{arrived at the}} airport in California to find that her flight was cancelled. Her former supervisor, Janet Weiland, was waiting for her close to the ticket counter, and tried to convince her to remain in the organization. Christman eventually got on a flight to Tampa, Florida, but was met at the gate when she arrived by agents of Scientology. Tampa police were notified, and escorted Christman safely away from the Scientologists. While a member of Scientology, Christman had given over $1 million to the organization; she used her inheritance money to pay for coursework. She commented to the St. Petersburg Times of Florida about the thought process she underwent after leaving the organization, [...] "When you get out and you get the whole thing, you're like, 'What was I thinking?'. I know the people inside are brainwashed and they're laughing at me. But to me, the truth is, I'm free. I can do what I want. I can <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want." ...|$|E
500|$|After Louisbourg, {{the company}} was {{stationed}} first at Fort Frederick (Saint John, New Brunswick), and then at Fort St. Anne, where {{the company was}} part of a campaign against Indians and Acadians that had taken refuge there from the ongoing expulsion of the Acadians. [...] These raids were sometimes quite brutal; the company was known to scalp Acadian settlers. [...] In one particularly brutal incident, Hazen was responsible for the scalping of six men, and the burning of four others, along with two women and three children, in a house he set on fire. [...] Joseph Bellefontaine, a leader of the local militia and the father of one of the women, claimed that he was forced to witness this event in an attempt to coerce his cooperation with the rangers. [...] (Bellefontaine escaped into the woods with two of his grandchildren.) [...] General Jeffrey Amherst, who did not hear of the incident until after he had promoted Hazen to captain, noted, [...] "I am sorry that to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have since heard of that affair has sullied his merit with me as I shall always disapprove of killing women and helpless children." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ringo Starr met {{songwriter}} Dean Grakal at a {{party on}} New Year's Eve 1996, during which the pair had a discussion about songwriting, with Grakal proposing that they form a team with Mark Hudson, whom Starr had met years prior while Starr was working on Time Takes Time (1992). Starr spoke of the writing process {{in an interview with}} Billboard magazine: [...] "This is the first time I've really been involved [...] Whereas before, I'd just sort of pick out other people's songs or songs other people had written that I thought were vaguely trying to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would have liked to say, on this, we're really trying to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want to say, thank you." ...|$|E
2500|$|His mother was, in many ways, {{instrumental}} {{in his ability}} to pursue art as a vocation. When he was 11 years of age, she had noted in her diary: [...] "The child's character is still so unformed that I cannot <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think of it. He behaves like a spoiled child, but he does not lack intelligence. We shall {{have to wait and see}} what is inside this chrysalis. Perhaps an artist?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Weeks later, CNN's Randi Kaye told an {{audience}} at West Virginia University {{that she had}} been listening to Cooper's interview from outside the Sago Baptist Church."I heard this unfolding on our air and I must have said something out loud because there was a print photographer standing beside me and he said, 'Did you just <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think you said?' and I said, 'I think there's only one alive,'" [...] the CNHI News Service quoted Kaye as saying.|$|E

2500|$|In a June 2006 podcast, Obama {{expressed}} {{support for}} telecommunications legislation to protect network neutrality on the Internet, saying: [...] "It is because the Internet is a neutral platform that I can put out this podcast and transmit it over the Internet {{without having to go}} through any corporate media middleman. I can <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want without censorship or without having to pay a special charge. But the big telephone and cable companies want to change the Internet as we know it." ...|$|E

He is what he is and I have the right to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> say about him," [...] she said.

2500|$|She then {{wrote to}} her mother, Queen Victoria: ...I have heard {{different}} things about poor Rudolf which may perhaps interest you. Prince Bismarck {{told me that the}} violent scenes and altercations between the Emperor and Rudolf had been the cause of Rudolf's suicide. I replied that I had heard this much doubted, upon which he said Reuss had written it and it was so! He would send me the despatch to read if I liked, but I have declined. I did not <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought, which is that for thirty years I have had the experience of how many lies Prince Bismarck's diplomatic agents (with some exceptions) have written him, and therefore I usually disbelieve what they write completely, unless I know them to be honest and trustworthy men. Szechenyi, the Ambassador at Berlin, whom we know very well, tells me that there had been no scenes with the Emperor, who said to Szechenyi: Dies ist der erste Kummer, den mein Sohn mir macht.|$|E
2500|$|I {{could have}} done lots more, put in much more work and {{developed}} more pictures, but I had also a desire to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> felt about life. Simple things like a little picture in the window or {{the corner of the}} studio or an old stove in the kitchen have always been fascinating to me. They are very much alive, these flowers and grasses with the dew on them. Stieglitz always said, [...] "What have you got to say?" [...] I think in a few small cases I've said a few things, expressed how I felt, trying to show the horror of poverty or the beauty of black people. I think that in photography what you've done is what you've had to say. In everything this has been the message of my life. A simple supper, being with someone you love, seeing a deer come around to eat or drink at the barn - I like things like that. If I could make one true, quiet photograph, I would much prefer it to having a lot of answers.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] Maraton replied. [...] "I have {{a scheme}} of my own, {{scarcely}} developed as yet, a scheme which I wasn't sure, when I came here, that I should ever make use of, which justified me in <b>saying</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was nothing}} {{for me to do}} but to follow her. I greatly disliked going away without <b>saying</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to <b>say,</b> and I would have been willing to speak even at the front door, but she gave me no chance.|$|R
2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} album with the Chicago Sun-Times, Fiasco has stated: [...] "Lasers {{is a great}} album. I'm {{actually}} happy with the record. I feel I got to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted even with -- It doesn't make up for {{what it took to}} get through it. It's still being argued and debated upon. ... The climate of this record was very weird, in some instances surreal. I became very abstract. I had to create this commercial art that appeases the corporate side. I had to acquiesce to certain forces. Hopefully within that I snuck in some things I actually wanted to say any way I can." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, Fiasco has expressed that during the recording process of the album he has dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts: [...] "It was mentally destructive. I say it with a certain laissez-faire now because I'm past it [...] I was super-depressed, lightly suicidal, at moments medium suicidal – and if not suicidal, willing to just walk away from it all completely." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for Power 106, Gomez spoke in-depth about the inspiration behind [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", saying: [...] "Everybody has had a say in my life [...] meaning the world, the perception, the media. It was really frustrating. There is a song on my record called ‘Kill Em with Kindness.’ So I’ve always done that. I ignore, I ignore, I ignore. And then {{it just kind of}} got out of hand. So I went to the new label [...] and I was like, I have to say something. I need to <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want to say, and you guys have to help me {{figure out how to do}} that." [...] While working on the album, Gomez enlisted frequent collaborators Rock Mafia to help make her sound a reality. They helped Gomez on the creation of six tracks on the album, including [...] "Revival" [...] and [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", the latter being one of the most personal tracks on Revival. She told the producers that although the production was important, she wanted the focus of the song to be the lyrics.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2009, Raven-Symone {{announced}} that she {{would return to the}} studio to record her next album.

She said, [...] "It's good {{to go out there and}} spread your wings and find new talent and work with people you haven't worked with before. I'd love to find the next Timbaland or the next someone who's coming up and no one really knows yet. At the same time, I'd love to work with the Clutch and the J.A.M. again". In January 2011, she told to OnTheRedCarpet.com that she has been working on her fifth album. Da Beat Kadetz formerly known as The TriGz may be working on the project, with Manny Streetz (from Da Beat Kadetz) as executive producer. Raven revealed to Billboard that she would like to work with Sean Garrett again and that it will be R with an [...] "alternative base for lyrics". In an interview with Broadway.com in March 2012, she confirmed that she has no plans to release a new album, saying that she [...] "couldn't quite get it together" [...] and that the music she had been working on [...] "wasn't going to be something sellable."
