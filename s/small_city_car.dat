50|$|The Nido EV was {{designed}} and built entirely by the Pininfarina Design and Engineering Centre of Cambiano (Turin) to explore {{the concept of a}} small electric car for urban use.

50|$|Thus, the PF 126p was {{intended}} to be the first real, popular and affordable car, to motorize ordinary families. The licence was bought after the rise to power of a new PZPR leader, Edward Gierek, who wanted to gain popular favour by increasing consumption after the Spartan period under Władysław Gomułka. Despite {{the fact that it was}} a very <b>small</b> <b>city</b> <b>car,</b> it was the only choice for most families, playing the role of a family car. During holidays, it was common to see four-person families driving PF-126s abroad with huge suitcases on a roof rack; sightings of PF-126s towing a small Niewiadów N126 caravan specially designed for the PF 126 were also occasionally reported. PF 126p production, however, was not sufficient and the PF 126p was distributed through a waiting list. Usually families had to wait a couple of years to buy a car. A coupon for a car could also be given by the authorities based on merit.|$|E
50|$|The narrow {{profit margins}} of economy cars can cause {{financial}} instability for their manufacturers. Historically, Volkswagen in the 1970s and Ford in the 1920s almost collapsed {{because of their}} one model economy car business strategy.

5000|$|Today economy {{cars have}} {{specialised}} into market niches. The <b>small</b> <b>city</b> <b>car,</b> the inexpensive-to-run {{but not necessarily}} very small general economy car, and the performance derivatives that capitalise on light weight of the cars on which they are based. Some models that started as economy cars such as the Volkswagen Golf and Toyota Corolla, have increased in size and moved upmarket over several generations, and their makers have added smaller new models in their original market niches. The 2003 Volkswagen Golf Mk5 had put on so much weight, that some models weigh {{the same as a}} Volvo 200 Series. The supermini 2002 Volkswagen Polo Mk4 was longer and wider than the 1970s Volkswagen Golf Mk1. Gordon Murray the Formula 1 and Mclaren F1 designer, said when designing his new Murray T.25 city car:"Today with all the promises of hydrogen and hybrids and electric cars, if you could take ten percent out of the weight of every car, the effect in the next ten years would be more than that of all the hybrids and electric cars on the planet." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – This study {{examines}} {{the processes of}} organizational knowledge creation in two highly virtualized teams, one involved {{in the design of}} a <b>small</b> <b>city</b> <b>car</b> and the second in the re-design of a small industrial vehicle. Using Nonaka’s model of organizational knowledge creation, we explore how the virtualization of knowledge based processes, i. e. the intensive exploitation of ICTs in support of knowledge-based activities, has shaped new forms of knowledge creation both at individual and organizational level. In contrast with previous studies [1] that identified knowledge codification as the main contribution of ICTs, this study provides detailed micro-level evidence on the ability of virtual technologies to support the transfer and the creation of new knowledge both at explicit and tacit levels.

40|$|Active {{noise control}} systems offer a {{potential}} method {{of reducing the}} weight of passive acoustic treatments in vehicles and, therefore, increasing a its fuel efficiency. The active control of engine noise can be implemented cost-effectively by using the car audio loudspeakers as control sources {{and an array of}} low-cost microphones as error sensors. Such systems have been commercially implemented, but without also controlling road noise their subjective benefits may be limited. The active control of road noise using a feedforward control strategy has also been practically demonstrated, but these systems require a number of accelerometers to be mounted to the vehicle's structure to obtain a coherent reference signal and, therefore, lead to a significant implementation cost. This paper describes a multichannel feedback system for the active control of road noise, which uses an array of microphones and car audio loudspeakers that are common with ta feedforward engine noise control system. The design of the multichannel feedback controller is described and its performance is validated using offline simulations employing data measured in a <b>small</b> <b>city</b> <b>car...</b>|$|E

50|$|In Japan, {{although}} the laws against grey import products were strict, and domestic car makers and authorized dealers have to conform the vehicle dimension standards and other various regulations differing from Europe and United States, the laws against grey-imported vehicles are very lax due to absence of import tariffs, {{and there are}} some grey imported vehicles that were never officially sold in Japanese Domestic Market. These ranging from <b>small</b> <b>city</b> <b>cars</b> like Toyota Aygo and Smart ForTwo, to sports cars like AC Cobra and Chevrolet Camaro, to commercial vehicles, including pickup trucks like Toyota Tundra. Most cars were imported from their country of origin, and a few were converted to RHD, though some were later introduced to authorized dealers due to popular demand.|$|R
