Soil fertility, turfgrass visual quality and playing quality of seven elementary school playfields in Tucson, Arizona was assessed. Irrigation system performance was evaluated using the Water Resource Manager software. Maintenance regimes were evaluated for effectiveness in producing quality turf. Sprinkler distribution uniformity (D. U) was a function of effective turf management. Overuse put impossible demands on elementary school turf maintenance functions, the most critical of which was irrigation management. Good D. U. alone did not predict conservation potential nor did it indicate turf quality. While a qualified irrigation manager can use creative methods to conserve water even with a poorly designed system, conservation potential is lost when an unqualified manager is making irrigation decisions...|$|R

30|$|One {{of the key}} {{parameters}} influencing <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation <b>performance</b> {{is water}} quality. In this study, the spatial variability of groundwater quality parameters (EC, SAR, Na+, Cl−, HCO 3 − and pH) was investigated by geostatistical methods and the most suitable areas for implementation of sprinkler irrigation systems in terms of water quality are determined. The study was performed in Fasa county of Fars province using 91 water samples. Results indicated that all parameters are moderately to strongly spatially correlated over the study area. The spatial distribution of pH and HCO 3 − was mapped using ordinary kriging. The probability of concentrations of EC, SAR, Na+ and Cl− exceeding a threshold limit in groundwater was obtained using indicator kriging (IK). The experimental indicator semivariograms were often fitted well by a spherical model for SAR, EC, Na+ and Cl−. For HCO 3 − and pH, an exponential model was fitted to the experimental semivariograms. Probability maps showed {{that the risk of}} EC, SAR, Na+ and Cl− exceeding the given critical threshold is higher in lower half of the study area. The most proper agricultural lands for sprinkler irrigation implementation were identified by evaluating all probability maps. The suitable areas for sprinkler irrigation design were determined to be 25, 240 hectares, which is about 34 percent of total agricultural lands and are located in northern and eastern parts. Overall {{the results of this study}} showed that IK is an appropriate approach for risk assessment of groundwater pollution, which is useful for a proper groundwater resources management.|$|R

After the Northridge event, while broken pipes and sheared off sprinklers were found in some instances it was observed that many sprinkler systems were not damaged, particularly in modern systems that met the latest seismic codes and standards. It was estimated that 41 % of the sprinkler systems in Kobe city were damaged after the Kobe earthquake. In the Canterbury earthquakes, several tank water supply sources failed that had been put in place to provide a source of water for the sprinklers if the reticulated supply was compromised. Based on these findings, research into improved design methods for seismic resiliency of tank supplies is ongoing and changes are proposed to the 2013 release of the New Zealand automatic fire sprinkler standard from this work.|$|E
40|$|Did {{you know}} that the {{majority}} of the water used by Utah homeowners is applied to ornamental landscapes as irrigation (Utah Division of Water Resources, 2003) ? Our arid climate and low annual precipitation (10 inches of annual rainfall in Moab) make supplemental irrigation an essential requirement for many landscape plants. Since landscape irrigation is the single largest residential use of water, efficiently using that water is a very effective way of conserving precious water resources. Irrigating your landscape efficiently means you are doing your part to conserve water for the future, helping to delay costly water development projects, and being a good steward of Utah’s natural resources. Choosing appropriate plants, grouping them according to water needs, and maintaining them appropriately will help you to irrigate them effectively. However, three simple steps—focused on your irrigation system—will help you to be even more efficient. 1. A site inspection, 2. A <b>sprinkler</b> <b>performance</b> test, and 3.

40|$|Zero tillage and {{controlled}} traffic {{have been proposed}} as means for more productive and sustainable irrigated farming. Both practices affect soil infiltration characteristics and, therefore, should have effects on <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation <b>performance.</b> This study compared water infiltration and runoff in three sprinkler irrigation tests performed on an alluvial loam soil at different times during a maize (Zea mays L.) -cotton (Gossypium hirstium L.) rotation under two soil managements: permanent beds with crop residue retention (PB: planting beds maintained unaltered from year to year) and conventional beds with residues incorporated with tillage (CB: disc and chisel ploughing followed by rotavator pass and bed forming every year). Traffic was controlled and two types of furrows were distinguished in both tillage systems: with (+T) and without (-T) wheel traffic. The irrigation tests were performed on maize at full cover, on bare soil just before cotton sowing and on cotton with 50 % ground cover. Infiltration and runoff were affected notably by both traffic and soil management. The soil under PB infiltrated more water than under CB, and -T furrows more than +T furrows. Considering the combined treatments, -T furrows in the CB system infiltrated more water than +T furrows in the PB system. A sprinkler irrigation model for simulating water application and soil infiltration and runoff was formulated. The model was used to analyse irrigation performance under infiltration characteristic of the CB and PB systems in trafficked and non-trafficked furrows. Five irrigation performance indicators {{were used to assess}} the various combinations of tillage and traffic: Wilkox-Swailes coefficient of uniformity; application efficiency; deep percolation ratio; tail water ratio; and adequacy. The model was used to develop operation diagrams and provided guidelines for making irrigation decisions in the new controlled traffic/permanent bed system and in a standard conventional system. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|Many crop {{production}} management decisions by agricultural growers, production managers, or crop advisors can be informed by data from high resolution aerial images. This {{is because the}} spectral reflectance of vegetation provides {{an indication of the}} health of the plant as influenced by soil fertility, soil moisture availability, plant canopy, plant disease, and pests. However, acquisition of soil moisture values from remotely sensed data is rarely accomplished. Unmanned aerial vehicle technology and high-resolution multispectral imagery have proven to be of value for precise management of agricultural lands (precision agriculture). Activities such as vegetation canopy mapping, vegetation indices derivation, crop and soil temperature estimation, crop nitrogen estimation, and others have been demonstrated to be feasible, affordable and precise. AggieAirTM is a small, autonomous unmanned aircraft developed by the Utah Water Research Laboratory at Utah State University which carries multispectral cameras to acquire aerial imagery in the red, green, blue, near-infra red, and thermal spectra. This study reports on the development of two models using ANNs and RVMs learning machines that translate AggieAir imagery into acceptable estimations of surface soil moisture for a large field irrigated by a center pivot <b>sprinkler</b> system.

40|$|Precision {{in design}} of {{sprinkler}} irrigation systems and their proper management {{are very important}} for both development and also improvement of those systems. Therefore, the main objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the design and management of the solid-set sprinkler systems in Dehgolan plain located in Kurdistan province. For this purpose, 10 solid-set sprinkler systems were selected randomly and a few performance parameters such as: Christiansen’s uniformity coefficient (CU), distribution uniformity (DU), potential application efficiency of low-quarter (PELQ) and application efficiency of low-quarter (AELQ) were estimated. The results of investigation showed the mean values of 66, 50. 6, 44. 8 and 43. 8 %, for the above mentioned parameters, respectively. Also, the results of investigation showed both low PELQ values and water distribution uniformity of those evaluated systems compared to the recommended values by Merriam and Keller (1978). Moreover, due to deficit irrigation, except for one evaluated system, in all other systems, AELQ values were equal to PELQ. The results of our investigation also showed that non-suitable design and implementation of the evaluated systems were among the most important reasons for low values of PELQ, because of non-suitable operating pressure. The most important reasons for low water distribution uniformity were the simultaneous use of many <b>sprinklers</b> and also <b>performance</b> of different <b>sprinklers</b> models in a system.

40|$|Knowledge of {{the initial}} spray {{characteristics}} of sprinklers is critical for fire suppression performance analysis. Although numerous tests and {{studies have been conducted}} on fire sprinkler sprays, measurements were mostly conducted in the far-field due to spray diagnostics limitations.

With the development of advanced non-intrusive spray diagnostics, high fidelity initial spray measurements are possible, providing sprinkler discharge characteristics which are useful alone for nozzle development or together with analytical tools for prediction of suppression performance. In this study, a laser diagnostic technique based on Shadowgraphy was used to characterize the initial spray for actual fire sprinklers and nozzles having more basic configurations.

40|$|Abstract: The {{success of}} {{sprinkler}} irrigation system largely {{depends on its}} actual performance at field condition. Although the uniformity of water application {{is the most important}} aspects in the sprinkler systems performance, adequacy better explains the performance of the system. In this study, the adequacy of irrigation performance was measured actually at field condition considering three operating hydrant pressures (4. 0, 4. 5 and 5. 0 bars) and two sprinkler nozzle sizes (2. 4 * 4. 4 and 2. 4 * 4. 8 mm). The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the level of current adequacy of irrigation performance in relation to the predicted performance during the design period. Three different adequacy performances (delivery, infiltration and storage) were determined from the measurements of the two important basic <b>sprinkler</b> <b>performance</b> parameters: discharge and uniformity. The study result indicates excess irrigation water application more than the crop net irrigation requirement and soil moisture deficit, especially for the 2. 4 * 4. 8 mm nozzles sprinkler at all pressure ranges considered. Inline to this, tremendous losses in terms of deep percolation ( 40 %) have been observed, the consequence of which is leaching of soluble nutrients, loss of valuable water resources, reduced crop yield and rise of groundwater table. The later one might lead to drainage problems, which requires construction of expensive drainage [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This {{fire and}} life safety report covers a Battalion Headquarters Complex {{that is used}} for housing {{military}} troops. This is a complete review of the building with prescriptive based fire protection along with performance base review of the building. The prescriptive fire protection covers egress analysis of the space, passive fire protection (i. e. fire walls and doors) and active fire protection (i. e. fire alarm and fire <b>sprinklers).</b> The <b>performance</b> based section looks at the prescriptive requirements and sees if these would be enough for the application at hand. The building fire protection and life safety are covered by three different codes. The Uniform Facility Code (UFC), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and International Building Code (IBC). With the UFC being the driving code {{because it is a}} military based project and the others being derivatives there of. The building is a 3 story barracks housing approximately 296 military personnel. The location of the building is at an undisclosed location. In looking at the building height and area requirements it was determined that the building was too large in area based on the requirements of the IBC. To become code compliant the best solution was to break the building up into five separate areas using 2 -hour fire walls at strategic locations. The building was primarily of an R- 2 occupancy classification with some other areas. The travel distances, common paths and dead ends in the building were all code compliant. The exit capacity for the building was compliant with the number of occupants based on the egress analysis. Along those lines the evacuation time was also looked at for how long a general evacuation of the building would take. The water based fire protection and fire alarm for the building were designed in accordance with their applicable codes NFPA 13 R and NFPA 72 respectively. The water supply for the building was sufficient enough that the building would not require a fire pump to suppliant. There was a 4 head sprinkler calculation that was performed in the most remote location to show {{that there would be a}} sufficient supply of water and pressure. The fire alarm system is of an addressable type with mass notification for the building. There are horns and strobes with smoke detection throughout the building. There is a smoke detector in each sleeping room with a sounder base along with a horn. The performance based section consisted of using FDS model to show a worse case fire scenario for the building. For this building a dorm room with a trash can fire was looked at to see how this would affect the building with its protection features and see if there will be enough time to egress from the building. The parameters for the fire were a 100 kW slow growth trash can fire. The visibly for the building was set at 4 meters as the occupants will be familiar with the building at the 6 ft mark. The fractional effective dose (FED) at the 6 ft mark was set to 3500 ppm CO. The smoke temperature at the 6 ft mark was set to 200 F. The model was then ran for 5 minutes. It was determined after examining the model that current design would be enough to meet all parameters that applied to it...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} an in-depth {{analysis of the}} fire safety systems and design considerations of the Costco store located at 450 10 th Street in San Francisco, California, satisfying the requirements for completion of the FPE 596 – Culminating Experience in Fire Protection Engineering academic series. The building is introduced, followed by an analysis of the building structure, alarm and detection, egress, and sprinkler systems are designed based on prescriptive code. These systems are then analyzed from a performance based perspective to gain understanding of how the systems will respond to a challenging design fire. Their response is used to determine if the building is compliant with requirements of performance based design. The Costco store is a large warehouse style building of mixed occupancy. The fully sprinklered 122, 000 sq. ft. building is of noncombustible construction and is used for multiple occupancies. The primary occupancy of the large, warehouse-style building is for mercantile purposes. As seen in Figure 1, the store features an open floor plan with goods such consumer electronics, clothing, home, office, and work supplies, fresh and packaged foods and beverage are stored throughout the store in floor display and high piled rack storage orientations. Office, kitchen, and dining occupancies constitute a portion of the building, along with some areas designated service occupancies as shown in Figure 2. The study begins with an introduction to the structure of the building. Occupancy classification is determined, which combined with height and area data is used to determine allowable types of construction and the materials used. An array of prescriptive codes is examined and the structure of the building is found to be acceptable. After the structure of the building is fully explored, the life safety systems that impact occupant safety during a fire are discussed. An alarm and detection system is designed for compliance with prescriptive code. The alarm and detection section first identifies components used in the system, such as heat detectors, horn- strobes, and the fire alarm control panel. The locations of the system components are presented, and the expected response of the system to a fire is calculated. Adequate backup power is provided and maintenance of the system is established. Application of a Voice Alarm Communication Systems (EVACS) is considered but deemed unnecessary. After the alarm and detection design, the Costco is analyzed for its ability to allow for safe egress of occupants. The maximum occupancy of the building is determined, and the number, size, and location of exits are evaluated with consideration to the expected demographics of the store. Expected evacuation time is calculated, and tenability of occupants in a fire environment is discussed. 7 Once egress is investigated, a sprinkler system is designed with the goals of reducing the risk of harm to life and property. The sprinkler system components are discussed and the systems are laid out based on the occupancy and materials found the building. The hydraulic demands of the systems are calculated using hand calculations and sprinkler system modeling software, followed by a discussion of inspection, testing, and maintenance protocol. Recommendations are made to improve the <b>sprinkler</b> system <b>performance.</b> With these life safety systems designed and analyzed from a prescriptive approach, their effectiveness is put the test using performance based design. In the fire scenario, an ultra-fast growth rate fire with high heat release rate and output of toxic gases, based on full-scale testing of electrical equipment similar to that found in the Costco, is located in front of the main exit from the building, blocking its use. The Costco is filled to maximum occupancy. The required safe egress time of 5. 5 minutes is demonstrated to be less than the available safe egress time, based on the height of the smoke layer filling the store. Recommendations are then made for furthering the research of this report and exploring other design fires and performance criteria...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} an {{academic}} exercise, {{as part of}} the MS Fire Protection Engineering program of California Polytechnic State University. The project is a culminating report with regards to life safety analysis of the Christopher Cohan Center of Cal Poly, which builds on the fundamental and applied courses of the program. The analysis is twofold, where the first part is a Prescriptive Analysis of the building and its features, followed by a Performance Based Life Safety Analysis. Both parts are performed in accordance with NFPA 101 Life Safety Code 2015 edition, Codes/Standards references within NFPA 101, and supplemented by methods of the SFPE Handbook of Fire Protection Engineering. California have yet to adopt the Life Safety Code, which per definition, makes it impossible to determine if the building is a new or existing structure. Nevertheless, the building has been analyzed as an existing building. Where noted, necessary assumptions were made to complete the analysis. The building in question is part of the Performing Arts Center of Cal Poly, and consists of assembly-, business-, and storage occupancies. Two adjacent buildings make up the remaining parts of the Performing Arts Center, but these buildings will not be analyzed in this report. The Cohan Center is separated from adjacent buildings by 4 -hour rated walls, and/or separation distances of 60 ft. The prescriptive analysis concludes that the building in general meets the requirements of the applicable codes and standards, with the following exceptions: a place of assembly at the Balcony Level have no other means of egress than through the communicating space, the spacing of smoke detectors does not meet prescriptive requirements in the Entry Lobby, and the water supply for the sprinkler system is insufficient. All conclusions are based on the information available. The recommended actions are to perform a new water flow test, and based on the result, consider installing a fire pump to provide sufficient flow and pressure to the most remote area of the <b>sprinkler</b> system. The <b>performance</b> based analysis addressed life safety in the event of fire in scenery on stage. The fire was modeled at floor level, and in the fly-gallery. Based on building inspections, the author considers ignition more likely in the fly-gallery, than at the stage floor. The main focus of this model was to evaluate consequences of smoke spread, if the proscenium wall curtain fails to deploy. The analysis concluded that the fly-gallery fire meets the performance criteria, and results in an acceptable level of life safety. The scenery fire at the stage floor fails to meet the performance criteria of the Life Safety Code, with the current building design and feature. Further analysis concludes that installing addressable smoke detectors at the stage ceiling, that activates all smoke vents and sends an alarm signal to the fire alarm control panel, resulted in meeting the performance criteria regardless of the modeled fire location...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation to}} explore {{the characteristics of the}} initial drop screen which was formed by sprinkler heads at low water pressures was carried out. Two commercially available sprinkler heads (with thin and massive frame arms) were modified, {{not only in terms of}} deflector plate design, but also with respect to the orifice diameter, in order to decrease the flow and study the effect on liquid sheet thickness, initial sheet angle, sheet breakup distance and drop size distributions and their correspondence with the existing mathematical models. It was found that the addition of a boss in the sprinkler design had little impact on the average drop size and sheet breakup distance. The presence of the boss was found to influence the initial angle of the liquid sheet, which was in line with findings of previous researches. Longer slots on the deflector plate did not change the initial angle of the sheet considerably, but did result in an earlier sheet breakup and smaller median drop diameter. A drop combustion sub-model was built, introducing two novel parameters: theoretical heat capacity (THC) and evaporate heat capacity (EHC), which could be used for estimating the actual heat capacity of the spray. In combination with the calculated drop size distribution in a spray screen, the combustion sub-model confirmed that <b>sprinkler</b> <b>performance</b> does not depend merely on provided flow, but rather on the drop size and the number of drops in a drop screen.

Three breakup modes were observed depending on the injection conditions quantified through the We and the geometric details of the nozzle. Based on these breakup modes, scaling laws were developed to quantify the effect of nozzle geometry and injection condition on sheet breakup distance and drop size. The sheet breakup location followed a We - 1 / 3 power law for all observed breakup modes. However, drop sizes followed a We - 1 / 3 power law only for the ligament breakup mode which was observed to occur at very high We (We > 10 4). The shadowgraphs also provided spatially resolved measurements of drop size and velocity on a hemisphere 0. 3 m away from the nozzle. Based on these detailed measurements, a comprehensive spray initiation model was developed for the purpose of providing a high fidelity analytical description {{of the initial}} spray useful for spray modeling. A simple dispersion analysis, accounting only for drag forces on the droplet in a quiescent environment, was performed to compare with volume density measurements taken 1 m below the sprinkler.
