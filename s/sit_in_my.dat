500|$|Jackson's biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, {{has stated}} that the video is based on Jackson's real life. He used to walk alone at night looking for new friends, even {{at the peak of}} his musical popularity. The 1980s saw him become deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely. I <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room {{sometimes}} and cry. It's so hard to make friends... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find someone to talk to. But I just end up coming home." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson's {{previous}} album Off the Wall (1979) received strong {{critical acclaim}} {{and was also}} a commercial success, eventually selling over 20 million copies worldwide. The years between Off the Wall and Thriller were a transitional period for Jackson, a time of increased independence. The period saw the singer become deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely. I <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room sometimes and cry. It's so hard to make friends ... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping {{to find someone to}} talk to. But I just end up coming home." [...] When Jackson turned 21 in August 1979, he hired John Branca as his manager.|$|E
500|$|One {{night while}} Jackson was asleep, Joseph climbed {{into his room}} through the bedroom window. Wearing a fright mask, he entered the room {{screaming}} and shouting. Joseph {{said he wanted to}} teach his children not to leave the window open when they went to sleep. For a number of years afterward, Jackson suffered nightmares about being kidnapped from his bedroom. By the early 1980s, he was deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely. I <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room sometimes and cry. It's so hard to make friends... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find someone to talk to. But I just end up coming home." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Indians {{acted like}} children; {{they tried to}} cheat each other and got cheated themselves. When it comes my turn to sell my land, I do not think I shall give it up as they did." [...] Regarding {{possible}} future land cessions, he said: [...] "Father I speak for my people, not for myself. I am an old man. My fire is almost outthere is but little smoke. When I <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> wigwam & smoke my pipe, I think of what has past and what is to come, and it makes my heart shake. When business comes before us, we will try and act like Chiefs. If any thing is to be done, it had better be done straight." ...|$|E
500|$|Ted Williams said, [...] "Three {{days before}} he pitched I would start {{thinking}} about Robert Feller, Bob Feller. I'd <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room thinking about him all the time. God I loved it... Allie Reynolds of the Yankees was tough, and I might think about him for 24 hours before a game, but Robert Feller: I'd think about him for three days." [...] Feller was ranked 36th on Sporting Newss list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and also the publication's [...] "greatest pitcher of his time" [...] {{as well as a}} finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. Each year, American Legion Baseball presents the [...] "Bob Feller Pitching Award" [...] to the pitcher [...] "with the most strikeouts in regional and national competition." ...|$|E

[...] Smith described {{the experience of}} selling out the hometown venue: [...] "When I was in high school, I used to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> bathroom and sing with my guitar and pretend I was on the main stage of First Avenue...I was totally transported back to that moment as soon as I started playing and I got all giddy." ...|$|E

5000|$|On February 3, 1999, May {{spoke to}} a {{committee}} of the Arizona House about pending legislation that would prevent local jurisdictions from providing benefits to the domestic partners of their employees. He said: I know many of you expected me to <b>sit</b> quietly <b>in</b> <b>my</b> office, but I cannot <b>sit</b> quietly <b>in</b> <b>my</b> office when another member attacks my family and attempts to steal my freedom. And furthermore if this legislature intends to take my gay tax dollars, which work {{just as well as}} your straight tax dollars, then treat me fairly under the law.|$|R
2500|$|Bergman cited {{his desire}} to one day perform in Graceland as another {{influence}} on the project, musing that if the band became popular enough he {{would one day be}} able to perform there. Bergman commented [...] "I used to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> bedroom and think, 'Damn, if we could just play Graceland, I would die a happy guy'". Before the album was released, it was promoted by the release of a music video for the single [...] "They Live".|$|E
2500|$|Paglia's Sexual Personae was {{rejected}} by at least seven different publishers before it was published by Yale University Press, whereupon it became a best seller, reaching seventh place on the paperback best-seller list, a rare accomplishment for a scholarly book. 'Paglia called it her [...] "prison book", commenting, [...] "I felt like Cervantes, Genet. It took all the resources of being Catholic to cut myself off and <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> cell." [...] Sexual Personae has been called an [...] "energetic, Freud-friendly reading of Western art", one that seemed [...] "heretical and perverse", {{at the height of}} political correctness; according to Daniel Nester, its characterization of [...] "William Blake as the British Marquis de Sade or Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson as 'self-ruling hermaphrodites who cannot mate' still pricks up many an English major's ears".|$|E
2500|$|After {{completing}} the tour for Midnite Vultures (1999), Beck and his fiancée, stylist Leigh Limon, ended their nine-year relationship. Three weeks before Beck's 30th birthday, he discovered Limon {{had been having}} an affair with a member of Los Angeles band Whiskey Biscuit. Beck lapsed into a period of melancholy and introspection, during which he wrote the bleak, acoustic-based tracks on Sea Change. He wrote most of the album's 12 songs in one week, but shelved them. [...] "Songs <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head for a while," [...] he told Time in 2002. [...] "I have dozens in there, songs from eight years ago that I've written but never recorded. After a while, I just sort of decide to record them." [...] Beck also strayed from the songs to keep from talking about his personal life, as well as to focus on music and [...] "not really strew my baggage across the public lobby." [...] Eventually, however, he found the songs speak to an experience (a relationship breakup) that is common, and that it would not seem self-indulgent to record them. In 2001, Beck drifted back to the songs and called his frequent producer, Nigel Godrich.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have the}} one," [...] said he, {{with a strange}} voice; and then presently, [...] "He shall pay me for all this," [...] he added. And when I asked him what was his brother's part in our distress, [...] "What!" [...] he cried, [...] "he <b>sits</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> place, he bears my name, he courts my wife; and I am here alone with a damned Irishman in this tooth-chattering desert! O, I have been a common gull!" [...] he cried.|$|R

2500|$|My {{studio is}} crammed with equipment, but I ended up feeling I was being {{overcome}} by it all—it {{was just too}} much. I {{used to go to}} bed every night thinking 'Tomorrow, I'm going to write the tune. Tomorrow {{is going to be the}} day', but nothing ever happened. Eventually Neil McLellan pointed out that we'd been in the studio for four months without having anything to show for it. [...] Nat [...] was doing her own record so we weren't spending a lot of time together , but [...] there were always dogs to stroke and videos to watch and gardens to walk 'round, so I didn't ever feel like I was at work—I was too laid-back. [...] Neil [...] said we had to get out, get back to London. I knew I physically couldn't <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room any more, and for the first time in my life I listened to someone else and realised I actually needed help. It wasn't [...] that I needed help with the writing, just that I needed help finding the right headspace to get into the right frame of mind. I wanted to write a good album— one I was happy with—but to do that I knew I'd have to jerk myself out of [...] situation I was in and start again.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} obvious {{recurring}} linguistic motif in the play is that of state power as specifically represented by the crown and the throne. Both words occur multiple times throughout the play. For example, in Act 1, Scene 1 (which is set in parliament, with York spending most of the scene sitting on the throne), Warwick introduces the imagery, saying to York [...] "Before I see thee seated in that throne,/Which now the House of Lancaster usurps,/I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close" [...] (ll.22–24). He then introduces the word [...] "crown"; [...] "Resolve thee Richard, claim the English crown" [...] (l.49). Immediately after York sits in the throne, Henry enters, exclaiming, [...] "My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,/Even in the chair of state. Belike he means,/Backed {{by the power of}} Warwick, that false peer,/To aspire unto the crown and reign as king" [...] (ll.50–54). During the subsequent debate over legitimacy, Exeter tells York [...] "Thy father was a traitor to the crown" [...] (l.80), to which York replies [...] "Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown" [...] (l.81). Also during the debate, Henry asks York, [...] "And shall I stand, and thou <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> throne?" [...] (l.85). York next asks Henry, [...] "Will you we show our title to the crown? (l.103), to which Henry says [...] "What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?" [...] (l.105). As the debate reaches an impasse, Richard urges York, [...] "Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head" [...] (l.115). Henry refuses to yield however, declaring [...] "Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne?" [...] (l.125). Subsequently, during the debate about the conflict between Henry Bolingbrook and Richard II, York asks Exeter if Richard's abdication [...] "was prejudicial to his crown?" [...] (l.145) to which Exeter responds [...] "No, for he could not so resign his crown" [...] (l.146). York then demands that Henry [...] "Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs" [...] (l.173), to which Henry reluctantly agrees, [...] "I here entail/The crown to thee and to thine heirs forever" [...] (ll.195–196).|$|E

6000|$|Query: If a man, {{with the}} whole {{historical}} process behind him, can create an entity, a real thing, then is not the hypothesis of a Creator made substantial?

Because I have created him is no reason that he is any the less real. He is an idea; he is an entity: ergo, ideas are entities, and an entity is a reality.|$|R
