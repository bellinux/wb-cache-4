40|$|Windbreak Net is an {{extremely}} important facility of prevention of wind damage; however, windbreak net's function varies with different types; hence, the research's main purpose was to compare the differences of <b>shelter</b> <b>effect</b> with diverse windbreak net weaving types. The research adopted three types of windbreak nets of higher market share in Taiwan: plain weave, knitted weave, which had two different mesh shapes, and ribbed weave, which had two varied weaving methods. The wind tunnel test was conducted with these five sets of windbreak net, and relative wind velocity, wind velocity reduction coefficient, protection index, and economic benefit were used respectively to do comparison and make analysis to {{explore the influence of}} weaving type, mesh number and shape on wind velocity reduction effect. The test results showed that when all windbreaks had the same ventilation rate, the windbreak net of plain weave had the best <b>shelter</b> <b>effect,</b> the secondary was ribbed weave, and the worst was knitted weave; however, if both the shading and anti-insect functions were required, the windbreak net of knitted weave type was relatively more ideal to choose; yet if taking economic benefit into consideration, the windbreak net of ribbed weave was the cheapest. As for the mesh shape, triangle had better <b>shelter</b> <b>effect</b> than rectangle, and in this research case, mesh number had no significant difference in wind velocity reduction. 防風網是風害防治極為重要之設施，然而防風網之功能因其形式不同而異；因此，本試驗主要目的即在於比較防風網編織形式對減風功效之差異，研究中採用國內市占率較高之平織、針織及羅紋織三種形式防風網，其中針織有兩種不同網目形狀，而羅紋織則有兩種不同編織方式，將此五組防風網，進行風洞試驗，分別以相對風速、減風係數、保護指數及經濟效益比較分析，探討編織形式、網目數量及形狀對減風效果之影響。經試驗結果顯示，當透風率相同時，在減風功效方面，以平織形式之防風網最佳，羅紋織次之、針織最差；然而若需兼具遮陽及防蟲功效，則應選用針織形式之防風網較為理想；但若考量經濟效益，則又以羅紋織防風網最為價廉。至於網目形狀以三角形比矩形有較佳之減風功效，而網目數量在本試驗個案中，對於減風並無明顯差異...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{physical}} model for turbulent friction on rough surfaces with regularly distributed roughness elements. Wall shear stresses are expressed as functions of physical quantities. Surfaces with varying roughness densities and roughness elements with different aspect ratios are considered. We propose a straight forward method {{based on the}} conservation of momentum to deduce the drag on elements by expressing it as functions of the maximum drag and drag reductions ratios, as the drag on individual elements decreases as packing density increases. A drag reduction effect of momentum redistribution is proposed and the mutual <b>sheltering</b> <b>effect</b> is studied. These two drag reduction mechanisms for individual elements are significant for sparse and dense surfaces, respectively.

Having {{observed the}} ability of CRAb to shelter other susceptible bacteria from carbapenem killing, we sought to determine the factors contribut-ing to this <b>sheltering</b> <b>effect</b> by transforming different recombinant plasmids into recipient A. baumannii cells. The <b>sheltering</b> <b>effects</b> of CRAb were reproduced in recipient A. baumannii cells that highly expressed carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D -lacta-mases (CHDLs) through their associated strong promoter. With the use ofWestern blot analysis and a bioassay, the highly ex-pressed CHDLs {{were found to be}} extracellularly released and led to hydrolysis of carbapenem. The level of extracellular CHDLs increased after challenge with a higher concentration of CHDL substrates, such as carbapenem and ticarcillin. This increased CHDLmay, in part, be attributed to cell lysis, as indicated by the presence of extracellular gyrase. In the planktonic condition, the <b>sheltering</b> <b>effect</b> for the cocultured susceptible bacteria might represent an indirect and passive effect of the CRAb self-de-fense mechanism, because coculture with the susceptible pathogen did not augment the amount of the extracellular CHDLs.

The present study examines using of riprap for reduction of local scour in piers group {{and the results are}} compared with data from riprap on a single pier. The models consist of two and three circular-shaped piers in line with the flow, with the diameter of 0. 02 m and pier spacing of twice and four times the pier diameter. Four uniform riprap sizes with the diameters of 2. 86, 3. 67, 4. 38 and 5. 18 mm were used to cover the piers. The results showed that the effect of wake vortices formed at the downstream side of piers group was decreased as compared with single pier. The reinforcing and <b>sheltering</b> <b>effects</b> caused 31 % decrease in front pier and 60 % increase in back pier, respectively, for the length of cover riprap.

First, an experiment with a non-uniform porous fence located in a wind tunnel is performed to obtain a reference data set.

The numerical simulation is compared to experimental measurements for validation purposes. As a result, the numerical predictions show good agreements with the experimental data. Finally, the numerical investigations of the flow fields around porous fences with various combinations of upper and lower fence porosity are also presented.

It {{has been applied to}} the reconstruction of the fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT). However, such method suffers from low computational efficiency, and the time consumption is not desirable. One way to solve this problem is to introduce a priori knowledge which will facilitate iterative convergence. We presented an in vivo simulation environment for fluorescence molecular tomography (ISEFMT) using the Monte Carlo method to simulate the photon distribution of fluorescent objects and their sectional view in any direction quantitatively. A series of simulation experiments were carried out on different phantoms each with two fluorescent volumes to investigate the relationship among fluorescence intensity distribution and the excitation photon number, the locations and sizes of the fluorescence volumes, and the anisotropy coefficient. A significant principle was discovered, that along the direction of the excitation light, the fluorescent volume near the excitation point will provide <b>shelter</b> <b>effect</b> so that the energy of the fluorescent volume farther away from the excitation point is relatively lower. Through quantitative analysis, it was discovered that both the photon energy distribution on every cross section and the fluorescence intensity distributed in the two volumes exhibit exponential relationships. The two maximum positions in this distribution correspond to the centers of fluorescent volumes. Finally, we also explored the effect of the phantom coefficients on the exponential rule, and found out that the exponential rule still exists, only the coefficient of the exponential rule changed. Such results can be utilized in locating the positions of multiple fluorescent volumes in complicated FMT reconstruction involving multiple fluorescent volumes. Thus, a priori knowledge can be generalized, which would accelerate the reconstruction of FMT and even other images...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the shelter effects of non-penetrable {{windbreak}} structures. The field experimentation was carried out at two appropriately selected windbreak embankments in Chih-Kan, Peng-Hu Island and Lu-Kang, Chang-Hwa County. In addition to the velocity measurements,the velocity field behind the structure was assessed to determine the <b>shelter</b> <b>effect</b> of the windbreak em- bankment. The actual current flowing through the windbreak embankment is examined with the smoke experiment. In order to compensate the deficiency from the field experiment, this study employed 30 scaled models for wind tunnel experiments. Beside visualization analyses on the general relative wind velocity and flow field, the impact of drag coefficient and pressure distribution to the structure''s shelter effects is explored. To further supplement the singular tests of field experiments and wind tunnel experiments,sixteen cases of study are selected to supply more complete flow field and the structure''s sustaining conditions. The results are summarized as follows: 1. Five best multiple regression equations relating the shelter area to the structure''s geometric shapes and a best multiple regres- sion equation relating the drag coefficient to the structure''s geo- metric shape are proposed based on Buckingham Pi theorem and a step- wise multiple regression analysis. These equations can be utilized as the important guidelines for the designs of non-penetrable wind- break structures. 2. Through comparisons on the vertical velocity profiles, the drag coefficient,the streak line pattern and the results of the numerical calculations, the shelter effects of non-penetrable windbreak struc- tures are described as follows: a) The windward inclined angle effect When the height,the top thickness and the leeward inclined angle are the same, a greater windward inclined angle gives bigger average wind pressure on the surface. Therefore, the weaker the average flow speed along the upward slope, the stronger the vertex part of the horizontal wind velocity near the separating point of the windward surface; thus the bigger the airflow inertia. This results in more significant upward airflow variation,and more gradual downward move- ment of separation line. This is beneficial to the expansion of re- verse-flow area above the leeward surface, and it also increases the shelter efficiency. As a result, the inclined angle of the windward surface is the major factor determination to influence the strength of flow near the separation point. In general, a greater windward inclined angle leads to stronger separating point strength, a stron- ger the airflow inertia, and a larger reverse-flow area. b) The leeward inclined angle effect When the height, the top thickness and the windward inclined angle are the same, a greater leeward inclined angle gives smaller average wind pressure on the surface. Therefore, a stronger average flow speed along the upward slope results in more significant sepa- ration line''s ascending effect, and a slower descend. As a result, the inclined angle of the leeward surface is the major factor in affecting the ascend of separation line. In general,a greater leeward inclined angle yields weaker negative pressure on the leeward sur- face, a stronger airflow inertia, and a larger reverse-flow area. c) The top thickness effect When the height, the windward inclined angle and the leeward in- clined angle remain the same,a greater top thickness leads to stron- ger suction effect on the surface of the vertex part, and a tendency to make the separation line descend in advance. In addition, due to the thickness increase on the vertex part, the abrasive effect will increase,but the airflow inertia is weaker. Consequently the reverse- flow area is smaller and the <b>shelter</b> <b>effect</b> will also decrease. How- ever, in this study, the increase in the top thickness relative to the height is less significant. Therefore,the resulting variation in the <b>shelter</b> <b>effect</b> is less prominent. d) The geometric shape effect Given the same height with variation to the windward inclined angle,the leeward inclined angle and the top thickness,the structure will produce different profiles. This study classifies the structure into three major categories. The results indicate that the reverse- flow area of a flat standing structure is clearly larger than those of the triangle and the trapezoid structures. Among them,the reverse- flow of the trapezoid structure has the smallest shelter efficiency. The reason for the variation to this aforementioned mechanism is due to the complexity of the flow. e) The inclined angle complement effect Among the flat structures, the windward inclined angle and the leeward inclined angle are supplementary to each other. When the two are equal, it is an upright wall structure. As a result, the airflow inertia is the strongest in this instance and the shelter efficiency is optimal. When one of the sequences reduces, the shelter effects will decrease accordingly. 3. The numerical simulation results indicate that under the con- sideration of the shelter area the Renold number change has a mild effect on the <b>shelter</b> <b>effect</b> of the structure. However, the boundary layer thickness variation has more significant influence on the she- lter effects of the windbreak structure. 本研究之目的係以實驗及數值方法，探討不透風式構造物之防 風功效；在現地實驗方面，於澎湖赤崁及彰化鹿港地區，勘選適宜之 防 風堤試區兩處，除進行風速觀測，藉以瞭解氣流通過防風堤之分布 以分 析防風堤之防風功效外，並配合煙霧實驗，以觀測氣流通過防風 堤之實 態；而為彌補現地實驗之不足，研究中以 30 組縮尺模型進行風 洞實驗， 除一般性相對風速及流場可視化之分析外，更深入探討阻力 係數與壓力 分布對構造物防風功效之影響；又為進一步彌補現地及風 洞各單項試驗 之缺憾，因而再選擇 16 組研究個案，從事數值模擬，期 能瞭解流場變化 對構造物防風功效之影響，藉以提供更為詳盡之流場 狀況及構造物之受 力情形，使本研究之成果更臻完整。茲將研究之重 要結果摘述如下︰ 一、經由柏金漢π定理以及逐步複迴歸分析結果，獲得五組防風面積 與構造物幾何形狀間之最佳複迴歸方程式，以及一組阻力係數與 構 造物幾何形狀間之最佳複迴歸方程式，可提供從事不透風構造 物工 程規劃時之重要參考依據。 二、經由風速剖面、阻力係數、壓力係數、 煙線實驗及數值計算之相 互比較佐証，對於不透風構造物之防風機 制，可歸納獲致下列幾 項效應綜合作用之結果︰ 1. 迎風面傾斜 角之效應︰當高度、頂部厚度及背風面傾斜角皆相同 時，迎風面傾 斜角愈大，則其表面所承受之平均風壓力也愈大， 因而沿斜面向上 之平均流速愈弱，則在頂部迎風面邊緣分離點處 之水平方向流速較 強，亦即氣流之慣性力較大，造成氣流向上偏 移的效應愈顯著，使 得分離流線延緩下降，而有助於背風面迴流 區之擴大，同時亦提高 其防風功效；由此得知，構造物迎風面傾 斜角是影響分離點強度之 主要因素，傾斜角愈大，分離點強度愈 強，則氣流慣性力愈大，所 形成之迴流區愈廣。 2. 背風面傾斜角之效應︰當高度、頂部厚度及迎 風面傾斜角皆相同 時，背風面傾斜角愈大，則其表面所承受之平均 風壓力愈小，因 而沿斜面向上之流速愈強，造成分離流線上捧的現 象愈顯著，同 時延緩其下降，因此，有助於迴流區之擴大，同時亦 提高其防風 功效；由此得知，構造物背風面傾斜角是影響分離流線 上移之主 要因素，傾斜角愈大，背風面之逆壓愈弱，則氣流慣性力 愈大， 所形成之迴流區愈廣。 3. 頂部厚度之效應︰當高度、迎 風面傾斜角及背風面傾斜角皆相同 時，頂部厚度愈厚，其頂部表面 所產生之吸附效應愈強，有促使 分離流線提前下降的趨勢；此外， 由於頂部厚度增加，摩擦效應 亦隨之增強，則氣流之慣性力較弱， 因而所形成之迴流區較小， 防風功效亦隨之降低；但因本研究中， 頂部厚度之增加量對高度 之比，並不顯著，因而此效應對防風功效 所造成之差異並不明顯 。 4. 幾何形狀之效應︰當高度相同時， 隨迎風面傾斜角、背風面傾斜 角及頂部厚度之變化，構造物將產生 多種不同的斷面，在本研究 中將其歸納為三大類型，經分析結果發 現，直立平面式構造物之 迴流區明顯大於三角體及梯形體，又其中 以梯形體之迴流區最小 ，防風功效最差，造成此種差異之機制，如 上述所言，為多種因 子互動之結果。 5. 傾斜角度互補之效應︰ 在平面式構造物中，迎風面傾斜角與背風 面傾斜角彼此互為補角， 當二者相等時，即為直立牆構造物，由 上述得知，此時氣流之慣性 力最強，因而防風功效最佳；又當其 中之一順序遞減時，其防風功 效亦隨之遞減。 三、經由數值模擬結果証實，流場條件中，雷諾數超過 紊流領域之變 化對構造物防風功效影響極微，但邊界層厚度變化對 構造物防風 功效影響則較為顯著。封面 謝誌 中文摘要 英文摘要 表目錄 圖目錄 符號說明 第一章 緒論 1 - 1 前言 1 - 2 研究動機 1 - 3 研究目的 1 - 4 研究方法及內容 第二章 文獻回顧 2 - 1 大氣邊界層流場模擬之相關研究 2 - 2 風洞實驗阻塞效應之相關研究 2 - 3 雷諾數效應之相關研究 2 - 4 流場可視化之相關研究 2 - 5 不透風式構造物對防風功效之相關研究 2 - 5 - 1 防風牆構造物對防風功效之相關研究 2 - 5 - 2 防風堤構造物對防風功效之相關研究 第三章 理論基礎與分析 3 - 1 現地試驗之相關理論基礎與分析 3 - 1 - 1 大地邊界層厚度 3 - 1 - 2 大氣邊界層平均風速剖面分佈 3 - 2 風洞試驗之相督理論基礎與分析 3 - 2 - 1 紊流強度 3 - 2 - 2 雷諾應力 3 - 2 - 3 防風構造物之減風效應 3 - 2 - 4 風洞模擬之相似律 3 - 3 數值模擬之理論分析 3 - 3 - 1 控制方程式 3 - 3 - 2 有限體積法 第四章 野外現地實驗 4 - 1 前言 4 - 2 實驗材料與方法 4 - 2 - 1 實驗地概況 4 - 2 - 2 風速及風向觀測 4 - 2 - 3 煙霧實驗之材料與方法 4 - 3 結果與討論 4 - 3 - 1 風速剖面對防風功效影響之探討 4 - 3 - 2 相對風速對防風功效影響之探討 4 - 3 - 3 減風係數對防風功效影響之探討 4 - 3 - 4 摩擦速度(U#) 與粗糙長度(Z 0) 之探討 4 - 3 - 5 煙霧實驗之探討 4 - 4 小結 第五章 風洞實驗 5 - 1 前言 5 - 2 實驗材料與方法 5 - 2 - 1 實驗設備 5 - 2 - 2 實驗程序 5 - 2 - 3 迫近流場之設計 5 - 2 - 4 實驗模型之設計 5 - 2 - 5 模型測試位置之設計 5 - 2 - 6 實驗風速之設計 5 - 2 - 7 風速採樣點之設計 5 - 2 - 8 採樣頻率及時之設計 5 - 2 - 9 模型壓力乙之設計 5 - 3 結果與討論 5 - 3 - 1 迫近流場模擬之探討 5 - 3 - 2 風洞實驗與現地實驗之驗証 5 - 3 - 3 相對風速對防風功效影響之探討 5 - 3 - 4 防風面積對防風功效影響之探討 5 - 3 - 5 阻力係數對防風功效影響之探討 5 - 3 - 6 壓力係數對防風功效影響之探討 5 - 3 - 7 煙線實驗之探討 5 - 4 小結 第六章 數值模擬 6 - 1 前言 6 - 2 數值模擬設計 6 - 2 - 1 模擬個案 6 - 2 - 2 模擬區域大小之規畫 6 - 2 - 3 網格設計 6 - 2 - 4 邊界條件 6 - 2 - 5 起始條件 6 - 3 結果與討論 6 - 3 - 1 數值模式之驗証 6 - 3 - 2 流場分布對防風功效影響之探討 6 - 3 - 3 雷諾應力對防風功效影響之探討 6 - 3 - 4 紊流強度對防風功效影響之探討 6 - 3 - 5 雷諾數對防風功效影響之探討 6 - 3 - 6 邊界層厚度對防風功效影響之探討 6 - 4 小結 第七章 結論與建議 7 - 1 結論 7 - 1 建議 參考文獻 附...|$|E

One such area is still considered part of metro Albuquerque, commonly called the [...] "East Mountain" [...] area; it is covered in savannas or woodlands of low juniper and piñon trees, reminiscent of the lower parts of the southern Rocky Mountains, which do not actually contact Albuquerque proper. Most rain occurs during the summer monsoon season (also called a chubasco in Mexico), typically starting in early July and ending in mid-September.|$|R

Individual plants may be considered as porous roughness elements which absorb or redistribute the wind's momentum. The saltation threshold is the minimum wind velocity at which soil movement begins. The dependence of the saltation threshold on geometrical parameters of a uniform roughness array was studied in a wind tunnel.

40|$|Selected field {{windbreak}} (shelterbelt) {{designs were}} evaluated {{to assess their}} cost effectiveness of providing additional crop production, carbon sequestration, and hunting opportunities.;In terms of additional crop production, a three-row mixed windbreak with extensive management and low cost is the most cost effective because it requires the smallest corn yield increases to break even. Using a <b>sheltering</b> <b>effect</b> of 12 windbreak heights, the required additional yield is 0. 28 Mg ha - 1 yr- 1. A four-row spruce windbreak with intensive management and high costs is the least cost effective because it requires the largest corn yield increases that are 28 times larger {{than those of the}} mixed windbreak. Trees that grow faster and taller are more cost effective because they provide <b>sheltering</b> <b>effect</b> sooner and over larger distances allowing to break even with smaller yield increases that {{are more likely to be}} achieved.;In terms of carbon sequestration, a four-row cottonwood windbreak is the most cost effective because it accumulates the greatest amounts of above and below-ground carbon that allow it to break even with a lifespan as short as 30 years. Only a cottonwood windbreak accumulates enough carbon to break even at a comparison price of 10. 48 Mg- 1. A higher carbon price of 32. 38 Mg- 1 enables a mixed windbreak to break even. Spruce windbreaks (two and four rows) require higher prices to break even. Continuous CRP payments offset a significant portion of windbreak costs and allow more windbreaks to break even and at earlier times.;About 55...|$|R
