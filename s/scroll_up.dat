50|$|The arrow {{buttons on}} the {{keyboard}} may be clicked to <b>scroll</b> <b>up,</b> down, left, or right on a page.

The tag was first introduced in early versions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, and was compared to Netscape's blink element, as a proprietary non-standard extension to the HTML standard with usability problems. The W3C advises against its use in HTML documents.|$|E
50|$|The Vertical {{scrolling}} region {{is defined by}} setting the VS bit ($20) on a sequential series of ANTIC Mode Lines in the Display List.

50|$|The Vertical {{scrolling}} region {{in a display}} is defined by setting the VS bit ($20) on a sequential series of ANTIC Mode Lines in the Display List.

50|$|The Prog mode {{changed the}} input from a command line {{to a program}} editor. In this mode, BASIC {{programs}} could be entered one line at a time. Up and down arrow buttons were provided to <b>scroll</b> <b>up</b> and down through the program space. On most models, free calculations could not be entered in the Prog mode. Certain models, especially the Casio-derived ones, called this mode WRiTe mode.|$|E
5000|$|The verb [...] "to scroll" [...] is much {{used in the}} age {{of screen}} displays—computer displays, rolling credits in films and so on—with the screen filled with text moving (<b>scrolling)</b> <b>up</b> or down or sideways, {{appearing}} at one edge of the display and disappearing at the other as if being unrolled from one side of a <b>scroll</b> and rolled <b>up</b> at the other.|$|R
50|$|Quassel stores {{discussion}} {{history in}} either a PostgreSQL or a SQLite database. When <b>scrolling</b> <b>up</b> through the chat window, older sections of chat are loaded automatically from stored logs. In this way, one can seamlessly view logs of past discussions.|$|R

5000|$|... "Endless Mode" [...] {{features}} line fragments appearing {{from the}} bottom of the grid and gradually move to up to the top as more pieces appear. The rate at which the new pieces <b>scroll</b> <b>up</b> {{from the bottom}} increases as the levels go on. The game ends if any line fragments reach the top of the screen before they have been assembled into a full line.|$|E
50|$|Another {{scrolling}} technique with scrollbars {{is to look}} {{at which}} mouse button was pressed. For instance, a left-click on the down arrow might cause the window to scroll down, while a right click in the same place would <b>scroll</b> <b>up</b> (e.g. RISC OS), or the middle button could be used to place the thumb precisely. This form requires less fine motor skills, although it requires a multi-button mouse, and possibly a greater degree of GUI literacy.|$|E
50|$|The CPT 8000 had dual-window editing, where {{text was}} {{assembled}} in an upper window from text entered {{at the keyboard}} or from one or more files brought successively into the lower window. Words, lines, paragraphs, and pages could be slid from the lower window to the upper, as in the cassette tapes of the CPT 4200, or they could be deleted from the lower window. In addition the two screens could lock and <b>scroll</b> <b>up</b> or down together.|$|E
50|$|The cursor {{can still}} be moved forward and back by one {{character}} using the Left and Right arrow keys, and the text can be <b>scrolled</b> <b>up</b> and down by one line using the Up and Down arrow keys. This is known as Creeping.|$|R

5000|$|The two {{keys are}} {{primarily}} used to <b>scroll</b> <b>up</b> or down in documents, but the scrolling distance varies between different applications. In word processors, for instance, they may jump by an emulated physical page or by a screen view that may show {{only part of}} one page or many pages at once depending on zoom factor. In cases when the document is shorter than one screenful, [...] and [...] often have no visible effect at all.|$|E
50|$|A {{scroll wheel}} on a {{conventional}} mouse {{may also be}} used. Moving the wheel in a desired direction moves the content in the same direction. Most mice contain scroll wheels that only <b>scroll</b> <b>up</b> and down, but some mice contain scroll wheels that allow the user to scroll in any direction (up, down, left or right), including diagonal directions. While scrolling up and down, {{the direction in which}} the page scrolls in response to the direction that the user scrolls the scroll wheel can differ depending on the computer’s scrolling settings.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{features}} include an earpiece with built-in notification LED, a fingerprint sensor on the phone's back side, an infrared port allowing {{the phone to}} act as a universal remote, dual SIM-card support in select versions, a USB 2.0 with Type-C interface connector, and QuickCharge support. In addition to scanning fingerprints, the fingerprint sensor serves as a customizable [...] "smart button", enabling users to open apps or <b>scroll</b> <b>up</b> or down the screen. Users can also tap their knuckles on the screen to take screenshots or recordings, or draw letters to open specific applications.|$|E
5000|$|The {{game was}} {{available}} separately or with an 8 way dance mat controller, the difference from other dance games {{was that the}} dance arrows came from {{the centre of the}} screen outwards, rather than <b>scrolling</b> <b>up</b> the screen. The game had many popular chart hit songs on it including [...] "It's Like That" [...] by Run-DMC featuring Jason Nevins.|$|R

50|$|Editing a deck {{is quite}} simple; {{from all the}} cards in the trunk, when a card is {{highlighted}} by <b>scrolling</b> <b>up</b> and down, there is an option {{if it wants to}} go to the main or side deck. To make the task easier, there is a card filtering icon which lets the player choose what type of cards they are looking for.|$|R
