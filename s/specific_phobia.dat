25|$|Motivation lies at {{the core}} of many behaviorist {{approaches}} to psychological treatment. A person with autism-spectrum disorder is seen as lacking motivation to perform socially relevant behaviors – social stimuli are not as reinforcing for people with autism compared to other people. Depression is understood as a lack of reinforcement (especially positive reinforcement) leading to extinction of behavior in the depressed individual. A patient with <b>specific</b> <b>phobia</b> is not motivated to seek out the phobic stimulus because it acts as a punisher, and is over-motivated to avoid it (negative reinforcement). In accordance, therapies have been designed to address these problems, such as EIBI and CBT for major depression and <b>specific</b> <b>phobia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{evidence}} {{pointing to the}} existence of early-onset panic disorder, the DSM-IV-TR currently only recognizes six anxiety disorders in children: separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, <b>specific</b> <b>phobia,</b> obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder (a.k.a. social phobia), and post-traumatic stress disorder. Panic disorder is notably excluded from this list.|$|E
25|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} are {{a group of}} mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear. Anxiety is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as a fast heart rate and shakiness. There {{are a number of}} anxiety disorders: including generalized anxiety disorder, <b>specific</b> <b>phobia,</b> social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. People often have more than one anxiety disorder.|$|E
50|$|<b>Specific</b> <b>phobias</b> have {{a one-year}} {{prevalence}} of 8.7% in the USA with 21.9% {{of the cases}} being severe, 30.0% moderate and 48.1% mild. The usual age of onset is childhood to adolescence. Women {{are twice as likely}} to suffer from <b>specific</b> <b>phobias</b> as men.|$|R
40|$|Interest in subtypes {{of mental}} {{disorders}} is growing in parallel with continuing research progress in psychiatry. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine pure animal phobia in contrast to other <b>specific</b> <b>phobias</b> and a mixed subtype. Data from three representative Swiss community samples were analysed: PsyCoLaus (n =  3720), the ZInEP Epidemiology Survey (n =  1500) and the Zurich Study (n =  591). Pure animal phobia and mixed animal/other <b>specific</b> <b>phobias</b> consistently displayed a low age at onset of first symptoms (8 - 12  years) and clear preponderance of females (OR >  3). Meanwhile, other <b>specific</b> <b>phobias</b> started up to 10  years later and displayed almost a balanced sex ratio. Pure animal phobia showed no associations with any included risk factors and comorbid disorders, in contrast to numerous associations found in the mixed subtype and in other <b>specific</b> <b>phobias.</b> Across the whole range of epidemiological parameters examined in three different samples, pure animal phobia seems to represent a different entity compared to other <b>specific</b> <b>phobias.</b> The etiopathogenetic mechanisms and risk factors associated with pure animal phobias appear less clear than ever...|$|R

25|$|About 12% {{of people}} are {{affected}} by an anxiety disorder {{in a given year}} and between 5-30% are affected {{at some point in their}} life. They occur about twice as often in females as males, and generally begin before the age of 25. The most common are <b>specific</b> <b>phobia</b> which affects nearly 12% and social anxiety disorder which affects 10% at some point in their life. They affect those between the ages of 15 and 35 the most and become less common after the age of 55. Rates appear to be higher in the United States and Europe.|$|E
2500|$|An {{evolutionary}} psychology {{view is that}} the more unusual primary agoraphobia without panic attacks may be due to a different mechanism from agoraphobia with panic attacks. Primary agoraphobia without panic attacks may be a <b>specific</b> <b>phobia</b> explained by it once having been evolutionarily advantageous to avoid exposed, large, open spaces without cover or concealment. Agoraphobia with panic attack, though, [...] may be an avoidance response secondary to the panic attacks due to fear of the situations in which the panic attacks occurred.|$|E
2500|$|A {{retrospective}} study {{has shown that}} 40% of adult panic disorder patients reported that their disorder began {{before the age of}} 20. In an article examining the phenomenon of panic disorder in youth, Diler et al. (2004) found that only a few past studies have examined the occurrence of juvenile panic disorder. They report that these studies have found that the symptoms of juvenile panic disorder almost replicate those found in adults (e.g. heart palpitations, sweating, trembling, hot flashes, nausea, abdominal distress, and chills). The anxiety disorders co-exist with staggeringly high numbers of other mental disorders in adults. [...] The same comorbid disorders that are seen in adults are also reported in children with juvenile panic disorder. Last and Strauss (1989) examined a sample of 17 adolescents with panic disorder and found high rates of comorbid anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, and conduct disorders. Eassau et al. (1999) also found a high number of comorbid disorders in a community-based sample of adolescents with panic attacks or juvenile panic disorder. Within the sample, adolescents were found to have the following comorbid disorders: major depressive disorder (80%), dysthymic disorder (40%), generalized anxiety disorder (40%), somatoform disorders (40%), substance abuse (40%), and <b>specific</b> <b>phobia</b> (20%). Consistent with this previous work, Diler et al. (2004) found similar results in their study in which 42 youths with juvenile panic disorder were examined. Compared to non-panic anxiety disordered youths, children with panic disorder had higher rates of comorbid major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.|$|E

50|$|The DSM breaks <b>specific</b> <b>phobias</b> {{into five}} subtypes: animal, natural environment, blood-injection-injury, situational, and other. In children, phobias {{involving}} animals, natural environment (darkness), and blood-injection-injury usually develop {{between the ages}} of 7 and 9, and these are reflective of normal development. Additionally, <b>specific</b> <b>phobias</b> are most prevalent in children between ages 10 and 13.|$|R

2500|$|The Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory (CASI) is a {{behavioral}} rating checklist created by Dr. Kenneth Gadow and Dr. Joyce Sprafkin that assesses {{a range of}} behaviors related to common emotional and behavior disorders identified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM), including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, separation anxiety disorder, major depressive episode, mania, dysthymic disorder (now pervasive depressive disorder in DSM-5), schizophrenia, autistic spectrum disorder, anorexia, and bulimia. In addition, one or two key symptoms {{of each of the}} following disorders are also included: obsessive-compulsive disorder, <b>specific</b> <b>phobia,</b> panic attack, motor tics, vocal tics, and substance use. [...] CASI combines the Child Symptom Inventory (CSI) and the Adolescent Symptom Inventory (ASI), letting it apply to both children and adolescents ages 5 to 18. The CASI is a self-report questionnaire completed by the child's caregiver or teacher to detect signs of psychiatric disorders in multiple settings. Compared to other widely used checklists for youths, the CASI maps more closely to DSM diagnoses, with scoring systems that map to the diagnostic criteria as well as providing a severity score. Other measures {{are more likely to have}} used statistical methods, such as factor analysis, to group symptoms that often occur together; if they have DSM-oriented scales, they are often later additions that only include some of the diagnostic criteria. It is not yet clear scientifically whether a statistical or DSM-oriented approach is more useful at a clinical level. The CASI provides a low burden way of gathering a lot of information quickly about common problems, helping the clinician and family decide where to focus attention during interviews and treatment.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to discuss the current status of {{research}} with respect to <b>specific</b> <b>phobias</b> and social phobia as defined in the ICD- 10 and DSM-IV, and to provide op- tions for their classification in the ICD- 11. Both ICD- 10 and DSM-IV identify three main classes of phobias: <b>specific</b> <b>phobias,</b> social phobia, and agoraphobia. The latter two are often referred to as complex <b>phobias.</b> In <b>specific</b> <b>phobias,</b> the fear is limited to one or more well-de- fined classes of objects or situations: e. g., certain animals, aspects of the natural environment (heights, storms), specific situations (lifts, airplanes) or blood/injuries. Social phobia is characterized by fear of one or more social situations, while agoraphobia is defined by fear of leaving home or of places or situations from which escape may be difficult, including shops, crowds, and public places, or fear of travelling (alone) in trains, buses, or planes. The emphasis in this paper will be on <b>specific</b> <b>phobias</b> and social phobia, since agoraphobia is discussed in another article in this supplement (1) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{inclusion}} of “blood-injury phobia” within {{the category of}} <b>specific</b> or simple <b>phobias</b> in classificatory systems reflects a perception that fear has a primary role in the disorder. Consistent with this assumption, blood-injury phobia appears to share a common etiology with other phobias. Kendler, Neale, Kessler, Heath, and Eaves (1992) have argued from data comparing monozygotic with dizygotic twins that the genetic factor common to all phobias (agoraphobia, social <b>phobia,</b> and <b>specific</b> <b>phobias),</b> strongly predisposes a person to <b>specific</b> <b>phobias.</b>|$|R

5000|$|There are two {{assessment}} tools used to diagnose emetophobia; the <b>Specific</b> <b>Phobia</b> of Vomiting inventory [...] and the Emetophobia Questionnaire. The <b>Specific</b> <b>Phobia</b> of Vomiting Inventory and the Emetophobia Questionnaire are both self-report questionnaires {{that focus on}} a different range of symptoms. There have been {{a limited number of}} studies in regard to emetophobia. Victims of the phobia usually experience fear before vomiting, but feel less afterwards.

50|$|Phobias can {{be divided}} into <b>specific</b> <b>phobias,</b> social phobia, and agoraphobia.

The most common are fear of spiders, fear of snakes, and fear of heights. Occasionally they are triggered by a negative experience with the object or situation. Social phobia is when the situation is feared as the person is worried about others judging them. Agoraphobia is when fear of a situation occurs because it is felt that escape would not be possible.|$|R
