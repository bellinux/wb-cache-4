5|$|Given its {{formidable}} {{size and}} dentition, the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> {{is regarded as}} potentially dangerous to humans. However, it only rarely comes into contact with people due to its oceanic habits. Its natural curiosity and boldness may lead it to repeatedly and closely approach divers, and it can become dangerously excited {{in the presence of}} food. The <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> tends to be more aggressive if encountered on a reef than in open water. Cases of individual sharks persistently harassing divers and even forcing them out of the water have been reported. As of May 2009, the International Shark Attack File lists six attacks attributable to the <b>silky</b> <b>shark,</b> three of them unprovoked and none fatal.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} and cutting {{teeth of the}} <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> make it {{potentially}} dangerous, and it has behaved aggressively towards divers. However, attacks are rare, as few humans enter its oceanic habitat. Silky sharks are valued for their fins, {{and to a lesser}} extent their meat, hide, liver oil, and jaws. Because of their abundance, they form a major component of commercial and artisanal shark fisheries in many countries. Furthermore, their association with tuna results in many sharks being taken as bycatch in tuna fisheries. Although slow-reproducing like most other sharks, the wide distribution and large population size of the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> was once thought to buffer the species against these fishing pressures. However, data now suggest that <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> numbers are declining around the world, which prompted the IUCN to reassess its conservation status from Least Concern to Near Threatened in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> is viviparous: once the {{developing}} embryo exhausts its supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Relative to other viviparous sharks, the placenta of the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> is less similar to the analogous mammalian structure in that no interdigitation exists between the tissues of the fetus and mother. Furthermore, the fetal red blood cells are much smaller than maternal blood cells, which is opposite the pattern seen in mammals. Adult females have a single functional ovary (on the right side) and two functional uteri, which are divided lengthwise into separate compartments for each embryo.|$|E
2500|$|Schools of {{forage fish}} can draw <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> in large numbers. <b>Silky</b> <b>sharks</b> have been {{documented}} [...] "herding" [...] such schools into a bait ball trapped against the surface, and then consuming the entire school. When attacking tightly packed fish, <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> charge through the ball and slash open-mouthed, catching the prey fish {{at the corners of}} their jaws. Although multiple individuals may feed at once, each launches its attack independently.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{catch rates}} are {{considered}} the main impact of dynamic fisheries practices on marine ecosystems, but other effects can be equally important and are often ignored. Here we quantify a major, previously unknown source of shark mortality: entanglement in drifting fish aggregating devices, now widely used in the global tropical tuna purse-seine fishery. Using satellite tagging and underwater observational data, we developed two novel, independent, and complementary approaches, which quantify and highlight the scale of this problem. Entanglement mortality of <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> (Carcharhinus falciformis) in the Indian Ocean was 5 - 10 {{times that of the}} known bycatch of this imperiled species from the region's purse-seine fleet. More importantly, these estimates from a single ocean (480 000 - 960 000 <b>silky</b> <b>sharks)</b> mirror those from all world fisheries combined (400 000 - 2 million <b>silky</b> <b>sharks),</b> a situation that clearly requires immediate management intervention and extensive monitoring...|$|R
40|$|<b>Silky</b> <b>sharks,</b> Carcharhinus falciformis (Muller and Henle, 1839), are {{the primary}} elasmobranch bycatch species in tuna purse seine {{fisheries}} throughout the world's major oceans. Juveniles of this species commonly associate with drifting fish aggregating devices (FADs) deployed to enhance tuna catches in these fisheries. Here we present results from the first investigation into the behavior of juvenile <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> associated with drifting FADs in the western Indian Ocean. A total of 10 <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> were tagged with coded acoustic transmitters around drifting FADs equipped with acoustic receivers. Following release, all sharks undertook an excursion away from the FAD {{with which they were}} associated. Two individuals were subsequently never detected, while the initial absence period of the eight detected sharks ranged between 0. 1 and 3. 5 d. After returning, total association times averaged 5. 19 d (SD = 3. 15 d) and related horizontal movement rates ranged from 8 to 50 km d(- 1). Short excursions away from the FAD were undertaken by some individuals, all of which lasted a few hours and were made at night. During periods of association, <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> typically occupied the upper 35 m of the water column {{for the majority of the}} observation period. These results provide new insights into our understanding of associative behaviors. Further studies are needed to improve assessment of the impacts of FADs on the ecology of this species, a major concern considering the large number of FADs deployed...|$|R
5|$|More recently, Gavin Naylor's 1992 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} {{allozyme}} sequence data, {{found that the}} <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> {{is part of a}} group containing large sharks with a ridge between the dorsal fins. One branch within this group contains the sandbar shark (C.plumbeus) and the bignose shark (C.altimus), while the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> is the basal member of the other branch and the sister taxon to a clade containing the Caribbean reef shark (C.perezi), Galapagos shark (C.galapagensis), oceanic whitetip shark (C.longimanus), dusky shark (C.obscurus), and blue shark (Prionace glauca). Mine Dosay-Abkulut's 2008 ribosomal DNA analysis, which included the silky, blue, and bignose sharks, confirmed the closeness of those three species.|$|E
5|$|The <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> {{is one of}} {{the three}} most common pelagic sharks along with the blue and oceanic whitetip sharks, and counts among the most {{numerous}} large oceanic animals in the world with a population of at least tens of millions. Compared to the other two species, it is less strictly pelagic with the greatest numbers found in offshore waters associated with land, where food is more readily obtained than farther out in the truly open ocean. The <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> is an active, inquisitive, and aggressive predator, though it will defer to the slower but more powerful oceanic whitetip shark in competitive situations. When approaching something of interest, it may seem inattentive, sedately circling and sometimes swinging its head from side to side. However, it can respond with startling swiftness to any shift in its immediate surroundings. This shark is often found around floating objects such as logs or tethered naval buoys.|$|E
5|$|With prey often {{scarce in}} its oceanic environment, the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> is a swift, inquisitive, and {{persistent}} hunter. It feeds mainly on bony fishes and cephalopods, {{and has been}} known to drive them into compacted schools before launching open-mouthed, slashing attacks. This species often trails schools of tuna, a favored prey. Its sense of hearing is extremely acute, allowing it to localize the low-frequency noises generated by other feeding animals, and, by extension, sources of food. The <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> is viviparous, meaning that the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother. Significant geographical variation is seen in its life history details. Reproduction occurs year-round except in the Gulf of Mexico, where it follows a seasonal cycle. Females give birth to litters of up to 16pups annually or biennially. The newborn sharks spend their first months in relatively sheltered reef nurseries on the outer continental shelf, growing substantially before moving into the open ocean.|$|E
5|$|Sharks can {{be highly}} social, {{remaining}} in large schools. Sometimes more than 100 scalloped hammerheads congregate around seamounts and islands, e.g., in the Gulf of California. Cross-species social hierarchies exist. For example, oceanic whitetip <b>sharks</b> dominate <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> of comparable size during feeding.|$|R
5|$|Large {{numbers of}} <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> are caught by {{commercial}} and artisanal multispecies shark fisheries operating off Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, the United States, Ecuador, Spain, Portugal, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Yemen, and CÃ´te d'Ivoire. Even greater numbers are caught incidentally by tuna longline and purse seine fisheries throughout its range, particularly those using fish aggregating devices. It {{is the most}} common shark caught as bycatch in the eastern Pacific and Gulf of Mexico tuna fisheries, and the second-most common shark caught as bycatch (next to the blue shark) overall. The fins are valued as an ingredient in shark fin soup, with captured sharks often finned at sea {{and the rest of the}} body discarded. Fins from an estimated one-half to one and a half million <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> are traded globally per year; it is the second- or third-most common species auctioned on the Hong Kong fin market, which represents over half the global trade. The meat (sold fresh or dried and salted), skin, and liver oil may also be used, as well as the jaws: this species is the predominant source of dried shark jaw curios sold to tourists in the tropics. Some sport fishers catch <b>silky</b> <b>sharks.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Silky</b> <b>sharks</b> (Carcharhinus falciformis) are {{frequently}} caught in tuna purse seines set around fish aggregating devices (FADs). During a recent Bycatch Mitigation Research Cruise {{in the western}} central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) sponsored by the International Seafood Sustainabiligy Foundation (ISSF) {{we were able to}} characterize the frequency of capture and size frequency characteristics of <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> caught on drifting FADs and conduct experiments to assess the post-release survival of sharks released at various stages of the fishing operation. We used a combination of Pop-off satellite archival tags (PSATs) and acoustic and conventional I. D. tags to assess behavior and post-release survival. In addition, we took blood samples for analysis of various biochemical stress indicators {{that can be used to}} aid in interpretation of the post-release survival results. To establish baseline blood gas, metabolite and stress hormone levels, some sharks were caught, sampled and tagged prior to the onset of purse seine fishing operations or while still free swimming inside the net. These baseline levels can now be compared with the blood chemistry of sharks caught and released at different stages of the fishing operation. During the 31 sets of the cruise, we interacted with a total of 295 <b>silky</b> <b>sharks,</b> deployed 28 satellite tag...|$|R
5|$|The {{life history}} {{characteristics}} of the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> differ across its range (see table). Northwestern Atlantic sharks tend to be larger {{than those in the}} western-central Pacific at all ages, while eastern Pacific sharks tend to be smaller than sharks in other regions. Eastern Atlantic and Indian Ocean sharks seem to match or exceed the size of northwestern Atlantic sharks, but the figures are based on relatively few individuals and more data are needed.|$|E
5|$|A {{scientific}} {{description of}} the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> was first published by the German biologists Johannes MÃ¼ller and Jakob Henle under the name Carcharias (Prionodon) falciformis, in their 1839 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen. Subsequent authors have assigned this species to the genus Carcharhinus. Because MÃ¼ller and Henle's type specimen was a 53-cm-long female fetus from Cuba, adult silky sharks were historically not recognized as C.falciformis and were described as a separate species, Carcharhinus floridanus, by Henry Bigelow, William Schroeder, and Stewart Springer in 1943. Jack Garrick, Richard Backus, and Robert Gibbs, Jr. synonymized C.floridanus with C.falciformis in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Based on morphology, Jack Garrick {{suggested}} in 1982 that the nervous shark {{is closely related}} to the blacktip reef shark (C. melanopterus). Leonard Compagno in 1988 tentatively grouped these two species with the blacknose shark (C. acronotus), the copper shark (C. brachyurus), the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> (C. falciformis), and the night shark (C. signatus). The close relationship between the nervous and blacktip reef sharks was upheld in a 1992 phylogenetic study by Shane Lavery, based on allozymes, and again in a 2011 study by Ximena VÃ©lez-Zuazoa and Ingi Agnarsson, based on nuclear and mitochondrial genes.|$|E

5|$|On the {{infrequent}} {{occasions when}} they swim in oceanic waters, grey reef sharks often associate with marine mammals or large pelagic fishes, such as sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus). There is {{an account of}} around 25 grey reef sharks following a large pod of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), along with 25 <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> (C. falciformis) and a single silvertip shark. Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against grey reef sharks, using the sharks' rough skin to scrape off parasites.|$|R
5000|$|Malpelo is home of {{a unique}} shark population; swarms of 500 hammerhead sharks and {{hundreds}} of <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> are frequently seen by diving expeditions, making it a very popular sharkdiving location. Malpelo {{is one of the}} few places where the smalltooth sand tiger has been seen alive; it is frequently spotted at the dive site [...] "El bajo del Monstruo". Acanthemblemaria stephensi, the Malpelo barnacle blenny, is a species of chaenopsid blenny found in coral reefs around Malpelo.|$|R
5|$|Slim and streamlined, the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> has {{a fairly}} long, rounded snout with barely {{developed}} flaps of skin {{in front of}} the nostrils. The circular, medium-sized eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). Short, shallow furrows are present at the corners of the mouth. Fourteen to 16 and 13â17tooth rows are found {{on either side of the}} upper and lower jaws, respectively (typically 15 for both). The upper teeth are triangular and strongly serrated, with a notch in the posterior edge; they are erect at the center and become more oblique towards the sides. The lower teeth are narrow, erect, and smooth-edged. The five pairs of gill slits are moderate in length.|$|E
5|$|The Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezii) is {{a species}} of requiem shark, {{belonging}} to the family Carcharhinidae. It {{is found in the}} tropical waters of the western Atlantic Ocean from Florida to Brazil, and is the most commonly encountered reef shark in the Caribbean Sea. With a robust, streamlined body typical of the requiem sharks, this species is difficult to tell apart from other large members of its family such as the dusky shark (C. obscurus) and the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> (C. falciformis). Distinguishing characteristics include dusky-colored fins without prominent markings, a short free rear tip on the second dorsal fin, and tooth shape and number.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{growth rate}} of the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> is {{moderate}} compared to other shark species and similar for both sexes, though it varies significantly between individuals. One central Pacific study has found females growing much slower than males, but the results may have been skewed by missing data from large females. The highest reported growth rates are from sharks in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and the lowest from sharks off northeastern Taiwan. Males and females reach sexual maturity at ages of 6â10years and 7â12+years, respectively. Sharks from more temperate waters may grow slower and mature later than those in warmer regions. The maximum lifespan is at least 22years.|$|E
500|$|The {{specific}} epithet falciformis is Latin for [...] "sickle-shaped", {{which refers}} to {{the outline of the}} dorsal and pectoral fins. The <b>silky</b> <b>shark's</b> common name comes from the fine texture of its skin compared to other sharks, a product of its tiny, densely packed dermal denticles.

5|$|Based on {{morphological}} data, Jack Garrick {{suggested in}} 1982 that the blacknose shark has a sister relationship {{to a group}} containing the whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri) and the blackspot shark (C. sealei), while Leonard Compagno proposed in 1988 that this shark belongs in a group with five other species, including the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> (C. falciformis) and the blacktip reef shark (C. melanopterus). Molecular analyses have been similarly equivocal regarding the blacknose shark's phylogenetic relationships: Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis found this species {{to be the most}} basal member of Carcharhinus, while Mine Dosay-Abkulut's 2008 ribosomal DNA analysis indicated affinity between it and the blacktip shark (C. limbatus) or the smalltail shark (C. porosus). The whitenose shark (Nasolamia velox), found along the tropical western coast of the Americas, may be descended from blacknose sharks that experienced the teratogenic effects of incipient cyclopia.|$|E
5|$|Fossilized teeth {{belonging}} to the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> {{have been found in}} North Carolina: from the vicinity of two baleen whales, one in mud dating to the Pleistocene-Holocene (circa 12,000 years ago) and the other in Goose Creek Limestone dating to the Late Pliocene (circa 3.5 million years ago â Mya), {{as well as from the}} Pungo River, dating to the Miocene (23â5.3Mya). Fossil teeth have also been found in Pliocene strata at the Cava Serredi quarry in Tuscany, Italy. Carcharhinus elongatus, an earlier representative of its lineage with smooth-edged teeth, is known from Oligocene (34â23Mya) deposits in the Old Church formation of Virginia, and the Ashley formation of South Carolina. A set of poorly described, Eocene (56â34Mya) teeth resembling those of this species are known from Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{conducted}} off the Florida {{coast and}} the Bahamas {{have shown that}} silky sharks are highly sensitive to sound, in particular low-frequency (10â20Hz), irregular pulses. Experiments in which these sounds were played underwater attracted sharks from hundreds of meters away. Silky sharks likely orient to these sounds because they {{are similar to the}} noise generated by feeding animals such as birds or dolphins, thus indicating promising sources of food. These studies have also demonstrated that a <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> attracted by one sound will quickly withdraw if that sound abruptly changes in amplitude or character; this change need not be a sound produced by a predator to evoke the reaction. Over repeated exposures, silky sharks habituate to the sound change and stop withdrawing, though it takes them much longer to do so compared to the bolder oceanic whitetip shark.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the workshop were to continue to develop a stock assessment model for <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO), identify collaborators and data sources, and collate data. The meeting was attended by scientists {{from many of the}} IATTCâs member countries and other interested parties (Appendix I). On the first day, the IATTC staff gave several presentations describing the stock assessment model, available data, and modeling and data assumptions (Appendix II). The remainder of the meeting focused on identifying useful data sources which could potentially be available from collaborators. The available catch data for <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> are incomplete, and assumptions have to be made to reconstruct the total catch. The available data differs among nations and fleets within nations, and so different assumptions have to be made. The assessment model commences in 1993, when catches of sharks began to be recorded in the IATTC purse-seine data base; however, species identification was an issue {{in the early years of}} shark catch reporting. Effort data for the purse-seine fleet prior to 1993 are available, and could be used to reconstruct catch prior to 1993. At a minimum, catch needs to be reconstructed back to 1993 for all fleets. The stock assessment accommodates the fact that the population was exploited prior to 1993 through a series of assumptions and estimated parameters...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{follows from}} the {{estimation}} of catch rates and catches of key shark species submitted the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) Scientific Committee (SC 7, Lawson 2011). The developments presented here include additional analyses of the SPC data holdings for oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus; OCS) and <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> (Carcharinus falciformis; FAL) caught in longline and purse seine fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO). Oceanic whitetip and <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are some of the}} most commonly caught bycatch species in pelagic tuna longline and purse seine fisheries, however the quantity and quality of historical shark catch data are often poor (Camhi et al. 2008, Clarke et al 2011). A main driver of this is that sharks have long been considered nonâtarget species and as such are often either inaccurately recorded in vessel logbooks or entirely unârecorded. A surge in the shark fin trade in the 1990 s (Clarke 2009), combined with the practice of shark finning (i. e. retention of fins while discarding the carcasses at sea), has led to increased interest in the impact of fishing on shark populations (Clarke et al. 2007, Clarke and Harley 2010, Lawson 2011). At a basic level management plans rely on estimates of catch to assess this impact despite high levels of discards and low reporting (Clarke 2007, Clarke and Harley 2010). The framework for this analysis is to construct additional alternate inputs for stock assessmen...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the four species responsible for {{a significant number of}} fatal attacks on humans, a number of other species have attacked humans without being provoked, and have on extremely rare occasions been responsible for a human death. This group includes the shortfin mako, hammerhead, Galapagos, gray reef, blacktip, lemon, <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> and blue sharks. These sharks are also large, powerful predators which can be provoked simply by being in the water at the wrong time and place, but they are normally considered less dangerous to humans than the previous group.|$|E
25|$|Marine biota in {{the region}} have representatives of both the Indian and Pacific oceans which were caught in the Caribbean before the {{emergence}} of the Isthmus of Panama four million years ago. In the Caribbean Sea there are around 1,000 documented species of fish, including sharks (bull shark, tiger shark, <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> and Caribbean reef shark), flying fish, giant oceanic manta ray, angel fish, spotfin butterflyfish, parrotfish, Atlantic Goliath grouper, tarpon and moray eels. Throughout the Caribbean there is industrial catching of lobster and sardines (off the coast of YucatÃ¡n Peninsula).|$|E
500|$|In {{light of}} recent findings, in 2007, the IUCN reassessed the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> from Least Concern to Near Threatened worldwide. Regionally, it {{is listed as}} Near Threatened in the southwestern Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and western central Pacific, and as Vulnerable in the eastern central and southeastern Pacific and the northwestern and western central Atlantic. The <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> is listed on Annex I, Highly Migratory Species, of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, though this has yet to result in any {{management}} schemes. The species should benefit from bans on shark finning, which are being increasingly implemented by nations and supranational entities, including the United States, Australia, and the European Union. Organizations such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas [...] and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission [...] have also taken steps to improve fishery monitoring, with {{the ultimate goal of}} reducing shark bycatch. However, given the highly migratory nature of the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> and its association with tuna, no simple way is known to reduce bycatch without also affecting the economics of the fishery.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} habitats, mangroves, reefs and seagrasses, {{are found in}} Puerto Rico's ocean waters. A total of 677 fish species live in these habitats; 242 being reef species. Fish species found in Puerto Rican reefs are {{representative}} of the general Caribbean fauna. Common reef fishes include wrasses, damselfishes, white grunts (Haemulon plumieri), bluestriped grunts (Haemulon sciurus), queen parrotfish (Scarus vetula), and sharks (family Carcharhinidae). Sea breams (Archosargus rhomboidalis) and yellowfin mojarras (Gerres cinereus) are some of the species commonly found in mangrove habitats. Other species of interest include flatfishes, with 21 recorded species, and sharks, with more than 20 species. Oceanic whitetip <b>sharks</b> and <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> are common in the Mona Passage.|$|R
40|$|Responses to low-frequency (50 - 200 Hz), pulsed {{sounds were}} {{observed}} in reef sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum, Sphyrna tiburo), pelagic sharks (Carcharhiniis falciformis), and in several species of groupers (Mycteroperca bonaci, M. venenosa, and Epinephelus striatus). By three criteria for positive responses, (i) number present, (ii) closeness of approach to transducer, and (iii) attentiveness of behavior, sharks and groupers of reef areas scored higher during periods of sound playback than during control (quiet) periods. Pelagic <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> were attracted to low-frequency, pulsed sounds and apparently habituated to them on both an intra-daily and inter-daily basis.

500|$|The oceanic whitetip {{is usually}} solitary and slow-moving, {{and tends to}} cruise {{near the top of}} the water column, {{covering}} vast stretches of empty water scanning for possible food sources. Until the 16th century, sharks were known to mariners as [...] "sea dogs" [...] and the oceanic whitetip, the most common ship-following shark, exhibits dog-like behaviour when its interest is piqued: when attracted to something that appears to be food, its movements become more avid and it approaches cautiously but stubbornly, retreating and maintaining a safe distance if driven off, but ready to rush in if the opportunity presents itself. Oceanic whitetips are not fast swimmers, but they are capable of surprising bursts of speed. Whitetips commonly compete for food with <b>silky</b> <b>sharks,</b> making up for its comparatively leisurely swimming style with aggressive displays.|$|R
