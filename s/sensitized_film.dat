40|$|We report {{electron}} injection dynamics for {{a series}} of porphyrin sensitized nanocrystalline TiO 2 films, comparing zinc and free base porphyrins with a conjugated or nonconjugated linker group to the carboxylate binding group. Injection dynamics are measured used time correlated single photon counting, using dye sensitized ZrO 2 control films. These injection dynamics are correlated with molecular orbital calculations, electrochemical data and device photocurrent efficiencies. The injection dynamics, and overall injection efficiency is found to be increased by linker conjugation and by the use of a zinc central metal. The faster injection dynamics for the Zinc porphyrins is shown to be quantitative agreement with the higher singlet excited state energy of these dyes compared to free base porphyrins. For the most efficient dye studied, addition of a typical redox electrolyte to the dye <b>sensitized</b> <b>film</b> is observed to retard the injection dynamics. Moreover studies of sensitized ZrO 2 control films indicated that the redox electrolyte resulted in a reduction of excited state lifetime, indicative of an additional decay pathway competing with electron injection.

30|$|In {{the case}} of PbS/TiO 2, the PL {{emission}} spectra could be detected simultaneously with the Raman signal at 785 nm excitation. A very weak and broad PL band could be thus traced at 955 nm after subtraction of the glass background, {{as shown in the}} inset of Figure 4. This emission band emerges at wavelengths just above the absorption edge of the PbS/TiO 2 (approximately 840 nm), complying with the excitonic PL of an ensemble of PbS QDs with a broad size distribution around 3 nm [25]. Moreover, the PL emission band could be resolved only for freshly <b>sensitized</b> <b>films</b> PbS/TiO 2, while it degraded rapidly upon air exposure verifying the great sensitivity of the system to surface oxidation. The drastic reduction of excitonic emission evidenced for both CdS and PbS nanocrystals upon direct growth on TiO 2 by SILAR, markedly weaker than the emission colloidal QDs adsorbed on TiO 2 [11, 23], verifies the great potential of this deposition technique to enhance electronic coupling and the concomitant charge transfer between QDs and the underlying TiO 2 substrate.|$|R

40|$|The {{substance}} in syphilitic serum {{which is responsible}} for the Wassermann reaction, like that which determines the diagnostic flocculation tests, is associated with the globulin fraction of serum. Every positive Wassermann is accompanied by microscopic (or submicroscopic) aggregation, which is not an essential feature of the reaction; conversely, after every positive flocculation test, the washed precipitate will fix complement. An excess of antigen removes both flocculating and complement-fixing substances completely (> 95 per cent). Heating the lipoid-reagin precipitate to 100 ° for 1 minute destroys the <b>sensitizing</b> <b>film</b> of reagin globulin; the avidity for complement disappears simultaneously. Both the flocculating and complement-fixing properties of syphilitic serum are therefore determined by the same substance, a specifically altered fraction of the serum globulin, reagin. The Wassermann reaction is thus entirely analogous to complement fixation by any antigen-antibody complex. The same film of denatured serum globulin which sensitizes the antigen particles, whether red cells, bacteria, protein, or colloidal lipoid particles, to discharge and aggregation by electrolytes, also endows them with an avidity for complement.

40|$|As it {{has been}} shown by pump-probe {{experiments}} electron injection at the interface between a dye molecule and mesoporous TiO 2 proceeds with rates exceeding 1 x 10 (13) s(- 1). However, similar dye-TiO 2 systems exhibit residual dye emission with lifetimes extending into the long nanosecond range. To address this inhomogeneity of injection rates time-correlated single photon counting microscopy was used to compare the emission behavior of dye-sensitized mesoporous films of TiO 2 with that of individual anatase nanoparticles that had undergone extensive dialysis. The <b>sensitized</b> <b>films</b> produce intense residual emission with multiexponential decay components as long as 220 ns. The channels of mesoporous films contain physisorbed and trapped dye, which is the dominant source of the emission. It is likely that the wide range of lifetimes reflects the distribution of mean free paths experienced by the loose dye molecules diffusing within the film prior to undergoing oxidative quenching. In contrast, the intensity of emission from individual nanoparticles from which the loose dye was removed by dialysis is orders of magnitude lower. The lifetimes obtained from such particles are much shorter, with the primary component on a sub-nanosecond time scale. The presence of residual emission with a 230 ps lifetime shows that even on the surfaces of dialyzed nanoparticles there is a fraction of sensitizer molecules that do not inject electrons with the same high rate as is observed in ultrafast pump-probe experiments on films. Since the physisorbed dye was removed from these samples by dialysis, the residual emission is likely to originate from dye molecules bound to surface defects. Unusual collective emission bursts were observed in some of the measurements on sensitized nanoparticles. We attribute this behavior to stimulated emission from individual nanocrystallites. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Polyaniline <b>sensitized</b> titania thin <b>film</b> were {{fabricated}} by spin-coating from Ti-precursor containing PEG as surfactant via a sol-gel technique, {{in which}} titania-sol was synthesized by hydrolysis of tetrabutyl titanate in water-alcohol solution. The films {{were characterized by}} X-ray diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, thermal gravity-differential scanning calorimetry, and tested under self-made photocatalysis instrument. The results showed the synthesized porous films provided the active surfaces for self-polymerization of aniline. Compared with bare TiO 2 thin films, the composite films displayed a enhanced photocatalytic activity and could be the potential photocatalyst for indoor air decontamination or self-cleaning films...|$|R

We have coupled a dye-sensitized titania film with a manganese-oxo 2 ̆ 2 cubium 2 ̆ 2 water-oxidation catalyst, [Mn 4 O 4 L 6]+ (1 +, L = bis(methoxyphenyl) phosphinate) to achieve the direct oxidation of water using visible light. The photo-catalyst assembly was prepared by sensitizing a titania-coated FTO conductive glass electrode with a ruthenium(II) dye, followed by over-coating with a proton-conducting membrane (Nafion) doped with 1 +. Illumination of this photo-anode, when immersed in an aqueous electrolyte, generates a photocurrent that is sustained for multiple hours {{without the need for}} an applied potential. The complete photo-anode releases protons to solution and oxygen gas, simultaneously with photocurrent generation. The cooperation of all three components: catalyst, proton conductor and dye <b>sensitized</b> titania <b>film</b> were necessary for water oxidation to be achieved using only light as the driving force. This photoanode represents a functional molecular analog of photosystem II, the natural apparatus found in photosynthetic organisms...|$|R
40|$|We have {{delivered}} only 2 or 3 UV Holographic Optical Elements (HOEs) thus far and have fallen {{short of the}} intended goal in size and in dual wavelength function. Looking back, it has been fortuitous that we even made anything work in the UV region. It was our good fortune {{to discover that the}} material we work with daily was adequate for use at 355 nm, if well rinsed during processing. If we had stuck to our original plan of etching in small pieces of fused silica, we would still be trying to make the first small section in our ion mill, which is not yet operational. The original plan was far too ambitious and would take another 2 years to complete beginning where we left off this time. In order to make a HOE for the IR as well as the UV we will likely have to learn to <b>sensitize</b> some <b>film</b> to the 1064 line and we have obtained sensitizer that is reported to work in that region already. That work would also take an additional year to complete...|$|R
