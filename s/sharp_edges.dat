5|$|Thomas Young (1773–1829) {{extended}} Newton's particle {{theory of}} light {{by showing that}} light could also behave as a wave. He showed in 1803 that light could diffract from <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> or slits, creating interference patterns.|$|E
5|$|Shepherd {{satellites}} {{are small}} moons that orbit within, or just beyond, a planet's ring system. They {{have the effect}} of sculpting the rings: giving them <b>sharp</b> <b>edges,</b> and creating gaps between them. Saturn's shepherd moons are Pan (Encke gap), Daphnis (Keeler gap), Atlas (A Ring), Prometheus (F Ring) and Pandora (F Ring). These moons together with co-orbitals (see below) probably formed as a result of accretion of the friable ring material on preexisting denser cores. The cores with sizes from one-third to one-half the present day moons may be themselves collisional shards formed when a parental satellite of the rings disintegrated.|$|E
5|$|The Danube crested newt's {{back and}} sides are dark brown with black spots and white stippling. The belly is orange to red (in other crested newts, {{it is usually}} yellow or orange–yellow), with small or {{medium-sized}} black blotches that have <b>sharp</b> <b>edges.</b> Like all crested newts, T.dobrogicus males develop a crest on their back and tail during breeding phase, which can be quite high and jagged and usually starts between the eyes and nostrils. Another feature of males at breeding season is a bluish-white stripe along the tail.|$|E

5|$|Indigenous {{people of}} the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes have {{inhabited}} the area for hundreds of years. In pre-contact times, these people lived a nomadic lifestyle. They did not build permanent structures in which to live, as they moved from region to region to find food and resources. Animals such as caribou, martin, moose and caribou were hunted and trapped by the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes. In summer, these people gathered roots, plants and a volcanic glass called obsidian. Anahim obsidian was traded widely throughout the Interior {{and up and down}} the Coast from the community of Bella Coola. Arrowheads and knives were made from obsidian because when it breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture, it creates very <b>sharp</b> <b>edges.</b> A modified form of this lifestyle is practiced by some indigenous people to this day.|$|E
5|$|While {{working in}} the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo's {{interest}} in archaeology and old relics led him to reconstruct an armillary sphere from existing models {{as well as from}} ancient texts that could provide additional information. Shen used ancient mirrors while conducting his optics experiments. He observed ancient weaponry, describing the scaled sight devices on ancient crossbows and the ancients' production of swords with composite blades that had a midrib of wrought iron and low-carbon steel while having two <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> of high-carbon steel. Being a knowledgeable musician, Shen also suggested suspending an ancient bell by using a hollow handle. In his assessment of the carved reliefs of the ancient Zhuwei Tomb, Shen stated that the reliefs demonstrate genuine Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD) era clothing.|$|E
5|$|Although {{found to}} be {{reliable}} and accurate, the M249 was considered to present unacceptable hazards {{in the form of}} an exposed hot barrel and <b>sharp</b> <b>edges.</b> There were complaints that the front sight required special adjustment tools. On August 23, 1985, then-U.S. Under Secretary of the Army James R. Ambrose suspended M249 production pending the development of the product improvement program (PIP) intended to fix these problems. Congress deleted funds for the M249 from the Fiscal Year 1986 defense budget, then retroactively set aside the program's prior year's funds from the M249 program for other purposes, including retirement and pay raises. Over 1,100 M249s already issued were to remain in use, but be retrofitted with the PIP kit when it became available. Over 7,000 remaining M249s were to stay in storage at depots until corrective changes could be made. The PIP kit was eventually developed and implemented, and production of the M249 resumed. In 1994 the M249 squad automatic weapon was re-designated the M249 light machine gun.|$|E

5|$|Many {{teeth are}} widest at their midsections and narrow {{closer to the}} jaws, giving them the {{appearance}} of a teardrop. Teardrop-shaped teeth are unique to Dimetrodon and other closely related sphenacodontids, and help distinguish them from other early synapsids. As in many other early synapsids, the teeth of most Dimetrodon species are serrated at their edges. The serrations of Dimetrodon teeth were so fine that they resembled tiny cracks. The dinosaur Albertosaurus had similarly crack-like serrations, but, at the base of each serration was a round void, which would have functioned to distribute force over a larger surface area and prevent the stresses of feeding from causing the crack to spread through the tooth. Unlike Albertosaurus, Dimetrodon teeth lacked adaptations that would stop cracks from forming at their serrations. The teeth of D.teutonis lack serrations, but still have <b>sharp</b> <b>edges.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{geometry}} of a back country ski {{depends on its}} purpose—skis suited for forested areas where loose powder can predominate may be shorter and wider than those selected for open, exposed areas where compacted snow may prevail. Sidecut on Telemark skis promotes turning in forest and rugged terrain. Width and short length aid turning in loose and deep snow. Longer, narrower and more rigid skis with <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> are suited for snow that has been compacted by wind or freeze-thaw. Touring ski design may represent a general-purpose compromise among these different ski conditions, plus being acceptable for use in groomed tracks. Traction may come from a textured or waxed grip zone, as with classic skis, or from ski skins, which are applied to the ski bottom for long, steep ascents and have hairs or mechanical texture that prevents sliding backwards.|$|E
5|$|Beginning the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good {{went to work}} {{repairing}} the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph failed in 2004 due to a blown power supply. As with the ACS, the STIS was not designed {{with the intention of}} servicing it while in space, and one of the major challenges was to remove a cover plate held tight with over 100 screws using a specially designed tool called a fastener-capture plate, designed to trap the screws and washers and prevent them from floating into space when removed. While preparing the fastener-capture plate, Massimino encountered issues with a handrail that had to be removed to accommodate the fastener-capture plate. The handrail had a stripped bolt on the bottom, preventing it from being released. After trying multiple options without success, managers on the ground advised Massimino to use brute force to remove the handrail, so he could proceed with the removal of the cover plate. The procedure was tested at Goddard Space Flight Center prior to approving it, showing that the stripped bolt could be broken off safely using force. Working inside the orbiter, Feustel walked Massimino through the procedure slowly, advising him to tape the handrail with Kapton tape to prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose, {{to be aware of the}} reaction the force would have, as well as to watch for <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> on the handrail after removal.|$|E

40|$|We study {{luminescence}} spectra observed from InAs {{quantum dots}} (QDs) embedded in an n-type InGaAs-based heterostructure, where electron Cooper pairs penetrate from an adjacent niobium (Nb) superconductor with the proximity effect. Below the superconducting (SC) critical temperature of Nb, we observe substantial luminescence intensity enhancement and a <b>sharp</b> <b>edge</b> in luminescence spectra of InAs QDs. We explain the observed <b>sharp</b> <b>edge</b> in the luminescence spectra with the proximity effect, that is, with {{the consideration of}} opening of SC gap and modification of density of states (DOS) near the electron Fermi level in the n-type semiconductor heterostructure. We demonstrate that the <b>sharp</b> <b>edge</b> luminescence spectra are well reproduced by the SC DOS, with quasiparticle lifetime broadening and a Gaussian distribution of lowest QD state emission lines. We discuss the reason why it {{has been difficult to}} observe the <b>sharp</b> <b>edge</b> luminescence spectra in the previous quantum well-based SC light emitting diodes...|$|R

Expressions are deduced for the field strength at the vertex of the edge in both arrangements.
