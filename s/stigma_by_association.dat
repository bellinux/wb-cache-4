40|$|In this study, we {{explored}} <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association,</b> family burden, {{and their impact}} on the family members of people with mental illness. We also studied the ways in which family members coped with these phenomena. We conducted semistructured interviews with 23 immediate family members of people with mental illness. Participants reported various experiences of <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> and family burden. Social exclusion, being blamed, not being taken seriously, time-consuming caregiving activities, and exhaustion appeared to be the predominant forms of <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> and family burden experienced by the participants. The participants used problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies, separately or simultaneously, to cope with the negative impact of <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> and family burden. The results suggest that family members should have access to services to address these problems. Social, instrumental, and emotional support should be given to family members by community members and mental health professionals...|$|E
40|$|The {{life of a}} {{child with}} an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is known to include many difficulties, not only due to social, {{behavioural}} and communication difficulties, but also as the child does not fit society’s specifications of ‘normal. ’ Stressors encountered by caregivers raising a child with an ASD are well documented; however one often overlooked stressor for caregivers is <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association.</b> Research to date has begun to explore the impact of <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> on the wellbeing of caregivers raising children with an ASD. However research is scarce, and has not yet addressed how some caregivers who experience <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> manage to resist this negative influence. Through two studies this thesis explored the experience of caregivers of children with ASDs New Zealand, looking in particular at <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> and whether personal signature strengths (particularly hope, gratitude and curiosity) may decrease its impact on caregiver wellbeing. It also examined whether, in spite of documented negative outcomes for caregivers, there is in fact room for a caregiver to experience growth as a byproduct of raising a child with an ASD. Participants took part in interviews (Study One, six participants), or completed an online questionnaire (Study Two, 100 participants). All caregivers spoke of difficulties associated with raising their child which on the whole reflected previous research. Difficulties included practical restrictions, personal costs and social stigma. Every caregiver was found to have experienced <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association.</b> Study Two participants had all encountered both enacted and internalised <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> in the previous six months, and <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> had a significant negative relationship with caregiver wellbeing. Positively, if a caregiver possessed higher levels of hope or gratitude, mediation analysis found the presence of these strengths decreased the influence of <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> on wellbeing. Promisingly, all caregivers were also able to identify many ways in which they had grown as a byproduct of the experience of raising their child, whether it was through increased positive emotions, experiences, or personal development. Findings suggest that in spite of caregiver’s challenges they may not only survive, but thrive...|$|E

Understanding how stigma affects family members {{in terms of both}} their psychological response to the ill person and their contacts with psychiatric services will improve interactions with the family. Aims To investigate factors of psychological significance related to stigma of the relatives. Method In a Swedish multi-centre study, 162 relatives of patients in acute psychiatric wards following both voluntary and compulsory admissions were interviewed concerning psychological factors related to stigma. Results A majority of relatives experienced psychological factors of <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association.</b> Eighteen per cent of the relatives had at times thought that the patient would be better off dead, and 10 % had experienced suicidal thoughts. <b>Stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> was greater in relatives experiencing mental health problems of their own, and was unaffected by patient background characteristics.

40|$|Objectives: Relatives {{of people}} with mental {{illnesses}} are affected in many different areas of life, and are often concerned that their ill family members might be of danger to themselves or others. The aim of this presentation is to report some results from Swedish studies of relatives focusing on stigma, family burden, participation in care, and attitudes towards coercive treatment. Methods: In three different data collection periods in a longitudinal project, in all 455 relatives of committed and voluntarily admitted patients were interviewed, using a semi-structured questionnaire. Results: A majority of relatives experienced psychological factors of <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association.</b> Relatives‘ burden and participation in care were {{not found to be}} associated to violent behaviour by the patients or to the patients‘ diagnoses, but relatives of patients with suicide attempts scored higher on some of the burden and participation items than other relatives. Relatives reported stronger support for coercion {{in order to protect the}} patient than for easing family burden and protecting others. Conclusion: The results indicate that relatives of psychiatric patients experience <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> and low participation in care, but in general support the need for compulsory psychiatric care in specific situations. However, despite a heavy burden due to the patients‘ mental illnesses, relatives do not primarily call for coercion in order to ease the family burden. There is a need for the psychiatric services to involve and support relatives of patients with suicidal behaviour...|$|E

By reflecting upon our separate research experiences and drawing upon a body of reflexive sex work research, this article explores how, as sex work researchers, we experienced stigma not only in our professional roles as researchers, but also in our personal lives. We apply Goffman’s (1968) notion of stigma by association; and consider how stigma often associated with prostitution became transposed onto us. In particular, we compare and contrast our separate experiences of conducting sex work research to demonstrate our similar experiences of <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} phenomenon of <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> between firms {{in the context of}} corporate accounting scandals. I draw from the social psychology literature to develop a theoretical framework that supports the notion of director interlocks as a channel in which associated firms may experience stigma. I argue that allegations of corporate accounting scandal generate attributional search by investors to determine the cause(s) of the alleged scandal. Attribution theory suggests that investors are likely to attribute responsibility to corporate boards for failing to detect and prevent these scandals. Investors?????? perceptions of incompetent and/or unwilling directors in firms accused of accounting scandals may then spill over to directorship positions in associated firms, resulting in the stigmatization of these associated firms. The results strongly support the above arguments. I further adopted an information-based approach to argue that firms associated with stigmatized firms will experience different amounts of stigma, and some firms may experience no stigma at all. I applied social inference theories and agency theory to develop four categories of variables that may influence the amount of stigma experienced by associated firms. The results of the dissertation present strong evidence in support of most of the hypotheses. The characteristics of the interlocking director, the characteristics of the board, the strength of the director interlock, and the quality of corporate governance in an associated firm appear to influence the amount of stigma experienced by the associated firm. This dissertation highlights the possible (1) negative consequences of director interlocks, (2) understatement of the social costs of corporate accounting scandals, and (3) need for response strategies to mitigate the negative consequences of <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association...</b>|$|E

Conclusions: Potential uses of the measure are discussed. Intervention approaches for reducing stigma’s impact among HIV-affected African American {{adolescents are}} briefly outlined...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{document}} the levels of HIV stigma reported by persons living with HIV infections and nurses in Lesotho, Malawi, South Africa, Swaziland and Tanzania over a 1 -year period. HIV stigma has been shown to negatively affect the quality of life for people living with HIV infection, their adherence to medication, and their access to care. Few studies have documented HIV <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> as experienced by nurses or other health care workers who care for people living with HIV infection. This study used standardised scales to measure the level of HIV stigma over time. A repeated measures cohort design was used to follow persons living with HIV infection and nurses involved in their care from five countries over a 1 -year period in a three-wave longitudinal design. The average age of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHAs) (N= 948) was 36. 15 years (SD= 8. 69), and 67. 1 % (N= 617) were female. The average age of nurses (N= 887) was 38. 44 years (SD= 9. 63), and 88. 6 % (N= 784) were females. Eighty-four per cent of all PLHAs reported one or more HIV-stigma events at baseline. This declined, but was still significant 1 year later, when 64. 9 % reported experiencing at least one HIV-stigma event. At baseline, 80. 3 % of the nurses reported experiencing one or more HIV-stigma events and this increased to 83. 7 % 1 year later. The study documented high levels of HIV stigma as reported by both PLHAs and nurses in all five of these African countries.

40|$|If {{there were}} a stigma scale for chemotherapy, alkylating agents would be ranked {{at the top of}} the list. The {{chemical}} term alkylation is associated with nonselective toxicity, an association that dates back to the use of nitrogen mustards during World War I as chemical warfare agents. That this stigma persists and extends to compounds that, through selectivity, attempt to “tame” the indiscriminate destructive potential of alkylation is the subject of this review. Selective alkylation, as it is referred to herein, constitutes an extremely nascent and dynamic field in oncology. The pharmacodynamic response to this selective strategy depends on a delicate kinetic balance between specificity and the rate and extent of binding. Three representative compounds are presented: RRx- 001, 3 -bromopyruvate, and TH- 302. The main impetus for the development of these compounds has been the avoidance of the serious complications of traditional alkylating agents; therefore, it is the thesis of this review that they should not experience <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association...</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the relationships between}} public stigma, <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> (SBA), psychological distress, perceived closeness, perceived heredity, {{and the type of}} family relationship among family members of people with a mental illness. Method: In this cross-sectional survey, data from 527 family members of people with a mental illness were analyzed. Results: Perceptions of public stigma were found to be positively related to SBA and SBA correlated with greater psychological distress and less perceived closeness. SBA also mediated relationships between perceived public stigma and psychological distress, and between perceived public stigma and perceived closeness. Further, among participants who reported SBA, immediate family members showed lower levels of perceived closeness than extended family members. Also, the perceived heredity of mental illness was associated with perceptions of public stigma and psychological distress. Conclusion: The findings suggest that family members of people with a mental illness could benefit from education on mental illnesses, their treatment, {{and the extent to which}} they are hereditary. Additionally, particular attention should be paid to the psychological needs that arise from being a caregiver of someone with a mental illness...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the experiences of}} relatives of those accused or convicted of serious offences such as murder, manslaughter, rape and sex offences. Relatives' accounts focus on {{the discovery of the}} offence as traumatic and life-changing, comparable in many ways to bereavement. Accounts of life before this point polarised and were either problem-identifying or normalising. Participants passed through several stages after discovering the offence as they began to feel they were coping and as the criminal justice process progressed. Responsibilities within the family were renegotiated and new responsibilities emerged which particularly revolved around the offender and his or her needs. Female relatives, and primarily mothers and wives, tended to take on these new tasks. Relatives experience secondary stigma because of their kin relationship to a serious offender, but this {{is more than just a}} <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association.</b> Relatives are themselves subject to a 'web of shame' on the basis of contamination and blame. The thesis explores the accounts that relatives construct about the offence and about their own actions. When accounting for the offence, relatives were found to use 'actor adjustments' and 'act adjustments' of various types. Many participants were searching around for reasons and trying to understand why the offence had happened; formulating these accounts was part of that process. The thesis considers why relatives use self-help and what it offers. It is argued that self-help provides a 'collective narrative' for understanding experience which relatives use as a resource along with other sources to understand their circumstances. Most participants in the research were female, as are most participants in self-help services for relatives of offenders, and reasons for this are considered. The thesis is based upon in-depth interviews with 32 relatives of serious offenders and participant observation of a self-help organisation for families of serious offenders over several years...|$|E
40|$|To date {{there are}} few studies of {{stereotyping}} of people with facial disfigurement, in comparison with a substantial body of research exploring how people with disabilities are seen by the general public. I conducted two experiments (both within-participants) which showed positive evaluations of people depicted as wheelchair users and, from the same participants, negative evaluations of people with facial disfigurements, compared to controls. This suggests the possibility that prejudice against people with facial disfigurement {{may be seen as}} somehow more socially acceptable than prejudice against people with disability, or perhaps stronger and harder to overcome. Experiment 2 investigated these possible explanations. Social norms were perceived to permit more discrimination against people with facial disfigurement than against wheelchair users, and implicit attitudes were more negative toward people with facial disfigurement and were correlated with evaluation negativity. These factors could help to explain the evaluative differences between the two disadvantaged groups. This study aimed to investigate the recruitment prospects of people with facial disfigurement and a contrasting group of wheelchair users, representing a functional impairment with little aesthetic impact. Three applications were made to each of 144 vacancies using three CVs and cover letters rotated around conditions in which one applicant was described as a wheelchair user, another had a non-contagious facial disfigurement, and the third (control condition) had neither. There was evidence of discrimination against people with facial disfigurement in jobs requiring high (but not low) levels of customer contact, and against wheelchair users for jobs entailing high or low customer contact. Aesthetic considerations, social norms, and the possibility of <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> <b>association</b> are discussed as potential underlying factors. A recent study, in preparation, observed that the reported emotional experience of participants when looking at people with facial disfigurement depends on the degree of perceived anonymity. Those participants who felt more anonymous reported feeling an elevated experience of repulsion whereas those who felt less anonymous appeared to have suppressed this emotion. This fits with earlier pilot studies which found that participants who were less aware that their responses would be compared to others tended to give poorer evaluations of people with facial disfigurement. It appears that there is considerable prejudice against people with facial disfigurement but this may be reduced in circumstances in which individuals are aware that they may be held to account for their attitudes...|$|E

40|$|This article {{develops}} {{the concept of}} territorial <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> analyzing {{how it can be}} cultivated at the level of political institutions across administrative divides. I consider the case of Detroit’s regional water department, which until 2016 was owned and operated by the city and served over 120 suburban regional municipalities. I start by examining the cooperative city–suburban water system expansion in the 1950 s and then analyze the rise of Detroit’s first black‐led administration in 1974, after which the water authority became a key regional institution that provided an opportunity for white suburban leaders to organize against the city. I find that suburban leaders advanced their immediate goal of mitigating rate hikes by declaring the city to be greedy and inept, instead of acknowledging structural conditions that increased operational costs. This had the effect of reproducing racialized stereotypes at the political level, which had enduring effects. The argument builds on the existing literature on territorial <b>stigma</b> <b>by</b> (1) identifying state institutions as sites for the propagation of stigma and (2) considering stigmatized places in relation to their non‐stigmatized neighbors. The analysis integrates material‐structural and cultural‐symbolic factors {{in order to understand the}} perpetuation of regional urban inequalities...|$|R
