6000|$|Their {{arrival in}} the village was an {{unexpected}} point of interest to many would-be mountaineers, who lounged about the place with macintoshes and umbrellas, growling at the weather. Any event out of the common forms a subject of interest to men who wait and have nothing to do. As the party passed them, growlers gazed and speculated as to who the new-comers might be. Some thought Miss Gray pretty; some thought otherwise--to agree on any point on such a day being, of course, impossible. Others [...] "guessed" [...] that the young fellows must be uncommonly fond of riding to [...] "get {{on the outside of}} a horse" [...] in such weather; <b>some</b> <b>remarked</b> that the [...] "elderly female" [...] seemed [...] "used up," [...] or [...] "blasee," [...] and all agreed--yes, they did agree on this point--that the thing in blue tights and buttons beside the driver was the most impudent-looking monkey the world had ever produced! ...|$|E
6000|$|Again, Mr. Fynney, in {{his report}} of his visit to Zululand in 1877, states that though the king and his [...] "indunas" [...] (councillors) denied that men were killed without trial, the people told a very {{different}} tale. Thus he says, [...] "In every instance, where I had so far gained {{the confidence of the}} Zulus as to cause them to speak freely, was I assured of the truthfulness of the statement that the king, Cetywayo, caused his people to be put to death in great numbers; and when I remarked that of course he did so after a fair and proper trial, in some cases my remark was greeted with a suppressed laugh or a smile. <b>Some</b> <b>remarked,</b> 'Yes, a trial of bullets;' others, 'Yes, we get a trial, but that means surrounding the kraal at daybreak and shooting us down like cattle.' One asked me what the Government in Natal intended doing, or what was thought in Natal about the killing, saying, 'It was not in the night that Sompseu spoke, but in the sunshine; the king was not alone, but his people were around him, and the ears of all Zululand heard these words, and the hearts of all Zulus were joyful, and in gladness they lifted up their hands saying: The mouth of our white father has spoken good words; he has cautioned his child in the presence of his people, and a good sun has risen this day over Zululand! How is it now? Has the king listened? Does he hold fast those words? No! not one. The promises he made are all broken. What does Sompseu say to this? You should dine at my kraal yonder for a few days, and see the izizi (cattle and other property {{of people who have been}} killed) pass, and you would then see with your own eyes how a case is tried.'" [...] Farther on Mr. Fynney says, [...] "When a charge is made against a Zulu, the question is generally asked, 'Has he any cattle?' and if answered in the affirmative, there is little chance of escape. Instances of killing occurred while I was in Zululand, and to my knowledge no trial was allowed. An armed party was despatched on the morning I left Ondine, and, as I was informed, to kill." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'His master {{came back}} from his talk with the white men, walking slowly towards the stockade in the street. Everybody was rejoiced to see him return, for while he was away every man had been afraid not only of him being killed, but also of what would come after. Jim went {{into one of the}} houses, where old Doramin had retired, and {{remained}} alone for a long time {{with the head of the}} Bugis settlers. No doubt he discussed the course to follow with him then, but no man was present at the conversation. Only Tamb' Itam, keeping as close to the door as he could, heard his master say, [...] "Yes. I shall let all the people know that such is my wish; but I spoke to you, O Doramin, before all the others, and alone; for you know my heart as well as I know yours and its greatest desire. And you know well also that I have no thought but for the people's good." [...] Then his master, lifting the sheeting in the doorway, went out, and he, Tamb' Itam, had a glimpse of old Doramin within, sitting in the chair with his hands on his knees, and looking between his feet. Afterwards he followed his master to the fort, where all the principal Bugis and Patusan inhabitants had been summoned for a talk. Tamb' Itam himself hoped there would be some fighting. [...] "What was it but the taking of another hill?" [...] he exclaimed regretfully. However, in the town many hoped that the rapacious strangers would be induced, by the sight of so many brave men making ready to fight, to go away. It would be a good thing if they went away. Since Jim's arrival had been made known before daylight by the gun fired from the fort and the beating of the big drum there, the fear that had hung over Patusan had broken and subsided like a wave on a rock, leaving the seething foam of excitement, curiosity, and endless speculation. Half of the population had been ousted out of their homes for purposes of defence, and were living in the street on the left side of the river, crowding round the fort, and in momentary expectation of seeing their abandoned dwellings on the threatened bank burst into flames. The general anxiety was to see the matter settled quickly. Food, through Jewel's care, had been served out to the refugees. Nobody knew what their white man would do. <b>Some</b> <b>remarked</b> that it was worse than in Sherif Ali's war. Then many people did not care; now everybody had something to lose. The movements of canoes passing to and fro between the two parts of the town were watched with interest. A couple of Bugis war-boats lay anchored in the middle of the stream to protect the river, and a thread of smoke stood at the bow of each; the men in them were cooking their midday rice when Jim, after his interviews with Brown and Doramin, crossed the river and entered by the water-gate of his fort. The people inside crowded round him, so that he could hardly make his way to the house. They had not seen him before, because on his arrival during the night he had only exchanged a few words with the girl, who had come down to the landing-stage for the purpose, and had then gone on at once to join the chiefs and the fighting men on the other bank. People shouted greetings after him. One old woman raised a laugh by pushing her way to the front madly and enjoining him in a scolding voice to see to it that her two sons, who were with Doramin, did not come to harm at the hands of the robbers. Several of the bystanders tried to pull her away, but she struggled and cried, [...] "Let me go. What is this, O Muslims? This laughter is unseemly. Are they not cruel, bloodthirsty robbers bent on killing?" [...] "Let her be," [...] said Jim, and as a silence fell suddenly, he said slowly, [...] "Everybody shall be safe." [...] He entered the house before the great sigh, and the loud murmurs of satisfaction, had died out.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the school}} opened in 1982, {{adjoining}} Seventh Street and Robb Drive were only dirt roads extended out to allow {{access to the}} school. <b>Some</b> <b>remarked</b> the school was [...] "in the middle of nowhere" [...] as {{it was more than}} a mile from other buildings. Since then, the construction of numerous subdevelopments has resulted in overcrowding problems. The building was designed for an enrollment of 1,600; in 2009/10 more than 1,800 were enrolled. In order to mitigate overcrowding concerns and comply with local fire regulations, several modular classrooms have been added to the campus.|$|E
5000|$|TSR {{originally}} intended to publish The World of Greyhawk (TSR 9025) early in 1979, {{but it was not}} released until August 1980.

Reviewers were generally impressed, but <b>some</b> <b>remarked</b> on the lack of a pantheon of Greyhawk-specific deities, as well as the lack of any mention of the infamous dungeons of Castle Greyhawk.|$|E

50|$|Henriade {{is one of}} two epic {{poems by}} Voltaire, the other being La Pucelle d'Orléans, which took Joan of Arc as a subject of satire. Voltaire wrote other poems during his life, but none were nearly as lengthy or {{detailed}} as these two. While Henriade was viewed as a great poem, and as one of Voltaire's best, many did not believe it to be his masterpiece, or the best he was capable of; many claimed it lacked originality or novel inspiration, and that it was nothing truly extraordinary. <b>Some</b> <b>remarked</b> that this low standard of quality came of Voltaire's non-comprehension of what he was writing, and his lack of enthusiasm in the poem's writing.|$|E
5000|$|... 1998 saw {{the first}} {{stand-alone}} reunion of The Idlers. Conceived and executed by Edward [...] "Cherry" [...] Beale, I'92, the reunion spanned an entire weekend in April. An opening dinner was hosted at The Griswold Inn in Essex, Connecticut on Friday night. <b>Some</b> <b>remarked</b> {{that this was the}} retirement dinner Don Janse never got. Saturday was filled with rehearsals for the reunion concert in Leamy Hall. The audience was full, and the show was opened by Forebitter of Mystic Seaport. Performances by the current Idlers, quartets, and Trios filled the middle of the program. John Heffermann, then Don Janse took turns conducting the combined 50-voice ensemble. Bob Newton finished the program, then handed out awards and recognition.|$|E

The layers of the controversy have nonetheless deepened with the revelation that Ayad Allawi, the initial source of the Habbush letter, was at CIA headquarters the week before the letter emerged, and a piece in The American Conservative by Philip Giraldi that claims an [...] "extremely reliable and well placed source in the intelligence community" [...] confirmed that the Vice President's Office was behind the Habbush letter, but that [...] "Doug Feith’s Office of Special Plans", not the CIA, carried out the forgery.|$|E

5000|$|Reactions to Pedro Sánchez's {{resignation}} were mixed. Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias {{commented that}} [...] "supporters of a PP government have imposed themselves on PSOE" [...] {{and called for}} opponents of the coup to rally behind Podemos as the only remaining leftist alternative in Spain to a Rajoy government. C's leader Albert Rivera praised Susana Díaz's move and called for the PSOE to [...] "help form a government". Sánchez's ouster was reported as being [...] "the most turbulent event" [...] in the party's history, with some regarding the whole event as [...] "shameful". Odón Elorza, former San Sebastián mayor {{and one of those}} present at the federal committee, stated that party colleagues had become [...] "hopelessly crazy" [...] and accused them of [...] "killing the party". <b>Some</b> <b>remarked</b> that the party had emerged [...] "fatally shattered", with the assembly [...] "ending in the worst way possible". Others commented that PSOE had chosen to [...] "commit suicide" [...] after the [...] "sorry spectacle" [...] it had offered, with PSOE member and former minister Javier Solana commenting of Sánchez's poor election results—cited as one of the motives behind his ejection—that [...] "when they become aware of the damages, they will all prefer 85 deputies". Former minister and Sánchez ally Jordi Sevilla said he was leaving the party because he felt [...] "deeply embarrassed" [...] at the whole event.|$|E
50|$|From his {{extensive}} 72 comments in Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư, Ngô Sĩ Liên {{appeared to be}} a Neo-Confucianist scholar. He often quoted from Cofucian literature in criticizing an event or a decision of the previous dynasties that, according to Ngô Sĩ Liên, did not follow the Confucian codes for an appropriate ruling institution. According to O. W. Wolters, Ngô Sĩ Liên respected the Confucianist perspective {{to the extent that the}} highest praise he could lavish on a Vietnamese ruler was that his achievements could not be bettered by even the most famous Chinese emperors in antiquity. However, the criticism and often harsh remarks of Ngô Sĩ Liên towards previous dynasties, especially the Trần Dynasty, could be understood as the historian's concern for the current dynasty, because the Lê Dynasty would fall into collapse unless it could avoid the mistakes that were committed by its predecessors like the Trần Dynasty. Besides, the historian paid attention in defining the identity of the nation; a typical example of this intention was the existence of the Hồng Bàng Dynasty in Peripheral Records, Ngô Sĩ Liên's introduction of this dynasty was challenged by several historians for the lack of information and the real motive of the historian in writing about Hùng kings. <b>Some</b> <b>remarked</b> that Ngô Sĩ Liên made the Hồng Bàng Dynasty the first dynasty of Vietnam only because he wanted to emphasize the identity and the independence of Vietnam from China.|$|E
