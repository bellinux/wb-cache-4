30|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>store</b> greeters may augment retailers’ efforts to attract consumer attention, build customer relationships, establish feelings of comfort among shoppers, and communicate brand image (Arnold 2002; Murray 2006). However, only one empirical study has examined the influence of <b>store</b> greeters upon consumer behavior. Findings from this experimental study (Otterbring et al. 2013) revealed that a <b>store</b> greeter (compared to an empty <b>store</b> entrance) positively impacted consumers’ spending, satisfaction, and perceptions of employees. Findings further revealed gender differences in consumers’ responses to <b>store</b> greeter conditions (i.e., <b>store</b> greeter alone at the <b>store</b> entrance vs. <b>store</b> greeter in combination with products at the <b>store</b> entrance). The <b>store</b> greeter in combination with products at the <b>store</b> entrance negatively influenced male consumers’ purchase behaviors, whereas the purchase behaviors of female consumers were unaffected by the <b>store</b> greeter conditions. The researchers suggested two possibilities for this difference in male consumers’ response to <b>store</b> greeter condition. First, the <b>store</b> greeter in combination with products at the <b>store</b> entrance condition may have resulted in an overly cluttered <b>store</b> environment/heighten stimulation, which may have encouraged avoidance behaviors. Second, the <b>store</b> greeter condition may have led male consumers to infer a persuasion motive {{on the part of the}} greeter, which may have increased their suspiciousness and decreased their willingness to purchase (Otterbring et al. 2013).|$|R
