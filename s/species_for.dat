5|$|Predominantly insectivorous, the {{black-throated blue warbler}} {{supplements}} its {{diet with}} berries and seeds in winter. It builds its nests in thick shrubs and the closeness of its nesting sites to the ground make it a favored <b>species</b> <b>for</b> the study of warbler behavior in the wild. The black-throated blue warbler defends its territory against other birds of the same <b>species</b> <b>for</b> both nesting and winter habitats. As the black-throated blue warbler requires large, unbroken forest areas for nesting, its numbers are declining.|$|E

5|$|At the time, no type {{specimen}} was specified, as the practice only arose later, in the 19th century. When a lectotype (type selected amongst original material) was designated, it {{was assigned to}} specimen 242.1 of Linnaeus' herbarium, the only V.thapsus specimen. The species had previously been designated as type <b>species</b> <b>for</b> Verbascum. European plants exhibit considerable phenotypical variation, {{which has led to}} the plant acquiring many synonyms over the years. Introduced American populations show much less variation.|$|E
5|$|Banksia speciosa is {{extremely}} sensitive to dieback caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi and numbers in Cape Le Grand and Cape Arid National Parks have been drastically reduced as whole populations of plants have perished after exposure. It is an indicator <b>species</b> <b>for</b> {{the presence of}} the disease. Nursery plants in Italy perished from root and basal stem rot from the pathogen Phytophthora taxon niederhauserii.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} rapid growth rate, short life span, and {{tolerance}} to handling and captivity, bigfin reef squids {{are regarded as}} one of the most promising <b>species</b> <b>for</b> mariculture.

5|$|Butterflies and moths {{are able}} to see ultra-violet (UV) light, and wing colours and {{patterns}} are principally observed by Lepidoptera in this region. The patterns seen on their wing under UV light differ considerably from those seen in normal light.

5|$|H.gammarus is {{the type}} species of the genus Homarus Weber, 1795, as {{determined}} by Direction 51 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. Prior to that direction, confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names, including Astacus marinus Fabricius, 1775 and Homarus vulgaris H.Milne-Edwards, 1837, and also because Friedrich Weber's description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary Rathbun, rendering any prior assignments of type <b>species</b> (<b>for</b> Homarus H.Milne-Edwards, 1837) invalid for Homarus Weber, 1795.|$|E
5|$|Human {{impact on}} the {{environment}} has resulted in an increase in the intrabreeding between species, with introduced species worldwide, which has resulted in an increase in hybridization. The genetic mixing may threaten many species with extinction, while genetic erosion in crop plants may be damaging the gene pools of many <b>species</b> <b>for</b> future breeding. Many commercially useful fruits, flowers, garden herbs and trees have been produced by hybridization. One flower, Oenothera lamarckiana, was central to early genetics research into mutationism and polyploidy.|$|E

5|$|Leccinum manzanitae is edible, and its {{taste is}} {{sometimes}} rated highly, although others {{have described the}} flavor as bland. Drying the mushroom may improve the flavor.

5|$|Lemurs are unusual among {{primates}} {{for their}} rapid dental development, {{particularly among the}} largest <b>species.</b> <b>For</b> example, indriids have relatively slow body growth but extremely fast tooth formation and eruption.

5|$|Many birds {{actively}} {{defend a}} territory from {{others of the}} same species during the breeding season; maintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks. Species that are unable to defend feeding territories, such as seabirds and swifts, often breed in colonies instead; this is thought to offer protection from predators. Colonial breeders defend small nesting sites, and competition between and within <b>species</b> <b>for</b> nesting sites can be intense.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{taxonomy}} uses database {{technologies to}} search and catalogue classifications and their documentation.

5|$|Several {{chemical}} compounds—some {{with unique}} biological activity—have been isolated and identified from Hydnellum <b>species.</b> <b>For</b> example, Hydnellum peckii contains atromentin, a pigment with anticoagulant properties similar to heparin.

5|$|Subsequent authors {{moved the}} {{blacktip reef shark}} to the genus Carcharhinus; in 1965 the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature {{designated}} it as the type <b>species</b> <b>for</b> the genus.
