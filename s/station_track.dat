5|$|The Mills Corporation {{has also}} been {{contracted}} to develop an underground transit center beneath Block 37 that will be jointly funded by the City of Chicago, the Chicago Transit Authority and The Mills Corporation. The planned project includes a new subway <b>station,</b> <b>track</b> connections and a common downtown airport check-in facility for train service to both O'Hare and Midway airports. Since the purchase in April 2007 the project has stalled. The CTA has {{pulled out of the}} project and the current economic climate has stalled the project. Delays in completion have caused the project to lose major tenants.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} vacuum trains that are {{designed}} to remove trash off of the tracks, but are ineffective and often broken. A 2016 study by Travel Math had the New York City Subway listed as the dirtiest subway system in the country {{based on the number of}} viable bacteria cells. In August 2016, the MTA announced that it had initiated Operation Track Sweep, which is an aggressive plan that will dramatically reduce the amount of trash on the tracks and in the subway environment, and in turn should reduce track fires and train delays. The frequency of <b>station</b> <b>track</b> cleaning will be increased. In a two-week period, 94 stations will be cleaned, an increase from 34 stations. Starting on September 12, 2016, the MTA launched an intensive two-week, system-wide cleaning from all of the tracks at all of the system's stations. New portable track vacuum systems are in the works as the MTA is working with two manufacturers. Three new powerful vacuum trains, two arriving in 2017, and the third in 2018, and 27 new refuse cars will be part of the operation.|$|E
5|$|Tracks 1 and 3 are {{connected}} {{to each other and}} to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line's southbound local track south of Grand Central <b>station.</b> <b>Track</b> 4 connects to the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line's northbound local track north of Times Square station. There is no connection between the two tracks that connect to the Lexington Avenue Line, Tracks 1 and 3, and the track that connects to the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, Track 4; therefore, it is now physically impossible for a train to go from the IRT Lexington Avenue Line through to the IRT Seventh Avenue Line or vice versa by using the shuttle tracks. At the Times Square station, to provide a connection between the platform for Track 4 and the rest of the station complex, there is a pedestrian bridge over Track 4. The pedestrian bridge is temporary removed to allow the train on Track 4 to leave for maintenance.|$|E

25|$|There may {{be other}} sidings at the station which are lower speed tracks for other purposes. A {{maintenance}} track or a maintenance siding, usually connected to a passing track, is used for parking maintenance equipment, trains not in service, autoracks or sleepers. A refuge track is a dead-end siding that is connected to a <b>station</b> <b>track</b> as a temporary storage of a disabled train.|$|E
25|$|A {{track with}} a {{spot at the}} station to board and {{disembark}} trains is called <b>station</b> <b>track</b> or house track {{regardless of whether it}} is a main line or loop line. If such track is served by a platform, the track may be called platform track. A loop line without a platform which is used to allow a train to clear the main line at the station only, it is called passing track. A track at the station without a platform which is used for trains to pass the station without stopping is called through track.|$|E

50|$|Until {{about the}} 1970s there were 4 tracks at the <b>station.</b> <b>Track</b> 1 (the southernmost track, {{closest to the}} station) was removed.
