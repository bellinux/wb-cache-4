40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{mitochondrial}} DNA marker COI for the gobies of the Cayman Islands reveals two categories of gobies: a set of genera that are no different genetically from other Caribbean populations, including Coryphopterus, Ctenogobius, Gnatholepis, and Priolepis, {{and a set of}} species that have local mtDNA lineages quite different from populations elsewhere in the region, including Elacatinus, Tigrigobius, and Risor. The cryptic divergent lineages include some that show distinct phenotypic differences and are described here as three new endemic species, as well as others that have divergent local DNA lineages but no apparent phenotypic differences and are treated as genovariants, i. e. populations of the same species with genetic differences. The Cayman Cleaner Goby, Elacatinus cayman n. sp., is found to be a close relative of E. evelynae (1. 5 % divergent; minimum interspecific distance, K 2 P), despite the fact that specimens were originally paratypes of E. genie (which are 7. 5 % divergent) : their shared feature of a complete groove above the upper lip is not apparently a synapomorphy with E. genie (i. e. not a shared derived character). A neighbor-joining tree of COI mtDNA sequences for all ten cleaner goby species of the tropical W. Atlantic is presented. The Cayman Sponge Goby, Elacatinus centralis n. sp., differs from E. horsti of the southern Caribbean by the color of the stripe and snout, and is further genetically than is the differently marked Shortstripe Sponge Goby E. chancei (the geographically intervening relative from the Lesser Antilles). A neighbor-joining tree of COI mtDNA sequences for all but two of the <b>striped</b> sponge <b>goby</b> species of the tropical W. Atlantic is presented. The Cayman Greenbanded Goby, Tigrigobius harveyi n. sp., has many more green bands than the Greenbanded Goby of the Antilles, T. multifasciatus, and differs by more than 10 % in mtDNA sequence; however, it is only 3 % different from the Redcheek Goby of Honduras and the Panamanian Greenbanded Goby. Other species of Tigrigobius, as well as Risor ruber, have divergent local DNA lineages, but no apparent phenotypic differences from other Caribbean populations. No consistent biogeographical relationships are apparent– the location of the nearest-neighbor lineages within the region differs from species to species. A revised species list for the gobies of the Cayman Islands is presented and the Kuna Goby, Coryphopterus kuna, is recorded there for the first time...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{regression}} design that encompassed {{the continuum of}} oyster reef biomass density in Harris Creek, MD, from unrestored reefs to those restored reefs with the greatest oyster biomass, we examined finfish and crustacean utilization of these habitats. Of the eight sites studied, three had not been subject to any restoration activities and five had been planted in 2012 with juvenile oysters set on oyster shell. All sites were sampled in April, June, August, and October 2015. During each sampling period, we assessed abundance, total length and biomass of finfish and examined gut contents to assess the diets of selected finfish species. Of the species collected that were likely to use reefs as habitat or a foraging ground, only striped bass and white perch were sufficiently abundant to support robust statistical analyses. Regression analyses found no clear relationship between oyster biomass density and catch per unit effort, total length or biomass for striped bass or white perch. Analyses {{of the effects of}} sampling period and restoration status (restored versus non-restored sites) on fish utilization frequently found an effect of sampling period but rarely found an effect of restoration status. In all cases where differences were detected, they suggested greater utilization of non-restored sites. Overall, data were sparse and the power of statistical analyses was low. Analyses of striped bass and white perch diets suggest that they are using oyster reefs as a foraging ground. Although comparisons of the proportion of striped bass and white perch that contained prey in their stomachs found no difference between those caught on restored sites versus non-restored sites, gut contents of both species contained prey taxa that are likely more abundant on restored oyster reefs than nonrestored sites. As a percentage of total prey wet weight, polychaete worms were the most important component of striped bass diets in both April (50 %) and August (47 %). Of the polychaete worms identifiable to species, 100 % were Alitta succinea, a species found in much greater abundance and biomass on restored oyster reefs than on comparable non-restored sites (Kellogg et al. 2013, Rodney and Paynter 2006). White perch diets were dominated by the ascidian Molgula manhattensis (52 %), a species generally found in greater abundance on hard substrates including oyster reefs. Of the identifiable species of fish found in the stomachs of striped bass, 93 % by weight were naked gobies (Gobiosoma bosc) or striped blennies (Chasmodes bosquianus), two species found in greater abundance and biomass on restored oyster reefs than nonrestored sites in Chesapeake Bay (Kellogg et al. 2013, Rodney and Paynter 2006). For white perch, naked gobies accounted for 95 % of the identifiable fish species by weight. Direct comparisons of white perch and striped bass diets to the prey fields at each sampling site will be conducted as part of a companion project also funded by NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office (Award #: NA 13 NMF 4570209 : Integrated assessment of oyster reef ecosystem services: Macrofaunal utilization, secondary production and nutrient sequestration). This companion project will also provide data on abundance, biomass and distribution of small, reef-associated species including naked <b>gobies,</b> <b>striped</b> blennies, and oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau).

40|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>goby,</b> Gobius vittatus Vinciguerra, 1883 is a Mediterranean gobiid species {{considered}} to be rare and lacking in data on its reproduction. Sex ratio, length and age at first maturity, annual cycle of gonad development, spawning period and fecundity of G. vittatus were studied on 704 specimens collected by SCUBA diving in the northern Adriatic Sea (Kvarner area) from April 2001 to March 2002. The monthly sex ratio did not differ significantly, except during the spawning season, when it was strongly biased in favour of females. The estimated length at first maturity was 32. 8 and 35. 4 mm for females and males, respectively. In both sexes gonad development started {{in the first year}} of life. All specimens were mature by the third year. The spawning season was from April to July. Total fecundity ranged from 560 to 3045, with an average of 1426 ± 89 ripe eggs/fish. The simultaneous presence of three clearly distinct sizes of oocytes in ripe ovaries indicate that this species is a multiple spawner...|$|E
40|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>goby,</b> Gobius vittatus Vinciguerra, 1883 is a Mediterranean gobiid species {{considered}} to be rare with very little data on its biology and ecology. A sample of 704 specimens of G. vittatus was collected by SCUBA diving at three locations in the northern Adriatic Sea (Kvarner area) from April 2001 to March 2002. The present paper provides the first information on age structure, lifespan, growth and mortality of G. vittatus. The size range of individuals was between 19. 2 and 54. 0 mm. The maximum estimated age was 4 and 3 years for females and males respectively. The total mortality rate (Z) {{was estimated to be}} from 0. 94 to 1. 08 for females and from 0. 99 to 1. 43 for males. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters estimated from the mean monthly age-length data were significantly different between sexes (females: L∞ = 50. 96, K = 1. 02 and t 0 = - 0. 47; males: L∞ = 50. 13, K = 1. 18 and t 0 = - 0. 42) ...|$|E
