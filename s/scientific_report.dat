5|$|I wish {{to state}} that my book, Vier Jahre unter Kannibalen, {{contains}} a number of misrepresentations regarding my journeys in New Guinea. The book in question is a <b>scientific</b> <b>report</b> in part only; it is primarily a fictional account of my experiences in New Guinea and owes its origin to the unusual circumstances prevailing in Germany {{at the time of}} my return. Some of the journeys I had actually undertaken are not described at all; on the other hand it contains passages that do not correspond with the facts.|$|E

25|$|Lake Bonneville, a pluvial lake, burst catastrophically in the Bonneville Flood about 14,500 years ago, due to {{its water}} {{overflowing}} and washing away a sill composed of two opposing alluvial fans which had blocked a gorge. Lake Bonneville was not a glacial lake, but glacial age climate change determined the lake level and its overflow.

Only two instances occurred in which the physician {{did not make the}} 4½-minute deadline and the ambulance left without the physician. The ambulance reached the scene usually within 14minutes, plus of course the 4½-minute pre-response time. One call took 25minutes owing to heavy traffic. Among the first group of patients seen by the MCCU were three patients treated for ventricular fibrillation. One of the three survived.|$|E
25|$|Known {{instances}} of nuclear reactions, aside from producing energy, also produce nucleons and particles on readily observable ballistic trajectories. In {{support of their}} claim that nuclear reactions took place in their electrolytic cells, Fleischmann and Pons reported a neutron flux of 4,000 neutrons per second, as well as detection of tritium. The classical branching ratio for previously known fusion reactions that produce tritium would predict, with 1 watt of power, the production of 1012 neutrons per second, levels {{that would have been}} fatal to the researchers. In 2009, Mosier-Boss et al. reported what they called the first <b>scientific</b> <b>report</b> of highly energetic neutrons, using CR-39 plastic radiation detectors, but the claims cannot be validated without a quantitative analysis of neutrons.|$|E
