5|$|Blood-C was {{designed}} to share only thematic similarities with earlier Blood projects. CLAMP was brought on board to both design the characters and help create the scenario. It featured several new elements to the Blood franchise, such as being primarily set within a high <b>school</b> <b>environment.</b> The Elder Bairns were inspired by the Great Old Ones from H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, and modeled after traditional Japanese monsters. Its bloody violence, a stylistic choice following the series' themes, resulted in censorship in Japan and eventual blacklisting in China. The series has received mixed to positive reviews from journalists.|$|E
5|$|ETS, whose {{prestige}} {{enhanced the}} credibility of its findings, conducted two landmark summative evaluations in 1970 and 1971, demonstrating that Sesame Street had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies illustrated the early educational effects of Sesame Street, and have been cited in other studies {{of the effects of}} television on young children. ETS reported that the children who watched the show most learned the most, and achieved better results in letter-recognition skills. Three-year-olds who watched regularly scored higher than five-year-olds who did not; children from low-income households who were regular viewers scored higher than children from higher-income households who watched the show less frequently. Similar results occurred in children from non-English-speaking homes. Although adult supervision was not required for children to learn using the material presented, children who watched and discussed the program with their parents gained more skills than those who did not. Children viewing the show in an informal home setting learned as much as children who watched it at school under a teacher's supervision. Regular viewers adjusted better to the <b>school</b> <b>environment</b> than non-viewers. They also had a more positive attitude toward school and better peer relations than non-viewers.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the Megami Tensei series is developed by Atlus' R Department 1. Other developers {{have been involved with}} the series: these include Multimedia Intelligence Transfer (Last Bible series), Lancarse (Strange Journey), CAVE (Imagine) and Nex Entertainment (Nine), and Arc System Works (Persona 4 Arena). Most of the games up to 2003 were handled by Okada, but when he departed to form his own company Gaia, Kazuma Kaneko became the series' creative director. There are two main writers in the franchise: Shogo Isogai and Ryutaro Ito. Ito first worked on Megami Tensei II, joining the team after development to write the script, along with working with the script and being part of the debug team. Isogai's first work for the series was the script for Shin Megami Tensei II. The next entry If... was also written by Ito, and designed as a departure from the grand scale of previous games, instead being set within a cloistered <b>school</b> <b>environment.</b> His final work for the series was the first Devil Summoner. Isogai also worked on Shin Megami Tensei II and If..., and later worked on multiple Devil Summoner games, Nocturne and Strange Journey. The music for the first five main Megami Tensei titles was composed by Tsukasa Masuko. For Nocturne, Shoji Meguro, who had done work on earlier spin-off titles, was brought in. He later became well known for his work on the Persona titles.|$|E

25|$|The {{psychiatric}} {{assessment of}} a child or adolescent starts with obtaining a psychiatric history by interviewing the young person and his/her parents or caregivers. The assessment includes a detailed exploration of the current concerns about the child's emotional or behavioral problems, the child's physical health and development, history of parental care (including possible abuse and neglect), family relationships and history of parental mental illness. It is regarded as desirable to obtain information from multiple sources (for example both parents, or a parent and a grandparent) as informants may give widely differing accounts of the child's problems. Collateral information is usually obtained from the child's school with regards to academic performance, peer relationships, and behavior in the <b>school</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E

Oakes. The issue started when a 12-year-old schoolboy dropped a 20cm (8-inch) long kirpan in school. School staff and parents were very concerned, and the student was required to attend school under police supervision until the court decision was reached. A student is allowed to have a kirpan on his person if it is sealed and secured.|$|E

40|$|This study {{determined}} {{attitudes of}} kindergarten through fifth grade teachers about <b>school</b> nutrition <b>environments,</b> their perceived influence on <b>school</b> nutrition <b>environments,</b> and self-reported classroom behaviors. Specific objectives were to: (a) identify perceived {{factors that influence}} the <b>school</b> nutrition <b>environment,</b> according to teachers surveyed; (b) examine relationships between elementary school teacher attitudes about <b>school</b> nutrition <b>environments</b> and perceived influence on the environment; (c) examine relationships between elementary school teachers’ attitudes about <b>school</b> nutrition <b>environments,</b> and self-reported classroom behaviors; (d) examine relationships between perceived influence over the <b>school</b> nutrition <b>environment</b> and self-reported classroom behaviors; and, (e) examine relationships between teachers’ demographic characteristics and attitudes and perceived influence on <b>school</b> nutrition <b>environments,</b> and self-reported classroom behaviors. Research was conducted in a mid-size Florida school district including 501 participants from 23 elementary schools. The Teacher Survey on <b>School</b> Nutrition <b>Environments</b> instrument was developed and validated by the researcher. Teachers identified the Food and Nutrition Services department as having {{the greatest impact on}} <b>school</b> nutrition <b>environments,</b> followed by student lunches and snacks sent from home. Responses to open-ended questions identified parents as part of the problem in developing healthy <b>school</b> nutrition <b>environments.</b> The Food and Nutrition Services department and parents were identified as having primary responsibility for encouraging healthy food choices at school, followed by administration, then teachers. Teachers did not perceive opportunities to provide input or to impact the <b>school</b> nutrition <b>environment</b> beyond their classrooms. The greater self-efficacy the teachers possessed, the more they felt they influenced the nutrition environment, and the more likely they were to offer menu suggestions, to sit or eat with students, to discuss food-related topics, and to integrate nutrition into lessons. Similar results were noted for teachers with college coursework in nutrition and those who were more experienced teachers. Classroom teachers should be encouraged to become involved and to recognize their role in developing and maintaining a healthy <b>school</b> nutrition <b>environment.</b> Increased communication should occur between school nutrition programs and teachers. Local wellness policy development and implementation should emphasize teachers’ influence...|$|R

25|$|Parents {{commonly}} cite {{two main}} motivations for homeschooling their children: {{dissatisfaction with the}} local schools and the interest in increased involvement with their children's learning and development. Parental dissatisfaction with available schools typically includes concerns about the <b>school</b> <b>environment,</b> the quality of academic instruction, the curriculum, bullying, and lack {{of faith in the}} school's ability to cater to their children's special needs. Some parents homeschool in order to have greater control over what and how their children are taught, to cater more adequately to an individual child's aptitudes and abilities, to provide instruction from a specific religious or moral position, and {{to take advantage of the}} efficiency of one-to-one instruction and thus allow the child to spend more time on childhood activities, socializing, and non-academic learning. Many parents are also influenced by alternative educational philosophies advocated by the likes of Susan Sutherland Isaacs, Charlotte Mason, John Holt, and Kenneth Robinson.|$|E
25|$|Early Braille {{education}} {{is crucial to}} literacy for a blind or low-vision child. A study conducted {{in the state of}} Washington found that people who learned braille at an early age did just as well, if not better than their sighted peers in several areas, including vocabulary and comprehension. In the preliminary adult study, while evaluating the correlation between adult literacy skills and employment, it was found that 44% of the participants who had learned to read in Braille were unemployed, compared to the 77% unemployment rate of those who had learned to read using print. Currently, among the estimated 85,000 blind adults in the United States, 90% of those who are braille-literate are employed. Among adults who do not know braille, only 33% are employed. Statistically, history has proven that braille reading proficiency provides an essential skill set that allows blind or low-vision children to compete with their sighted peers in a <b>school</b> <b>environment</b> and later in life as they enter the workforce.|$|E

25|$|Improving the {{surrounding}} home and <b>school</b> <b>environment</b> {{can improve the}} behavior of children with ADHD. Parents of children with ADHD often show similar deficits themselves, and thus {{may not be able}} to sufficiently help the child with his or her difficulties. Improving the parents' understanding of the child's behavior and teaching them strategies to improve functioning and communication and discourage unwanted behavior has measurable effect on the children with ADHD. The different educational interventions for the parents are jointly called Parent Management Training. Techniques include operant conditioning: a consistent application of rewards for meeting goals and good behavior (positive reinforcement) and punishments such as time-outs or revocation of privileges for failing to meet goals or poor behavior. Classroom management is similar to parent management training; educators learn about ADHD and techniques to improve behavior applied to a classroom setting. Strategies utilized include increased structuring of classroom activities, daily feedback, and token economy.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1902, Hobbs {{successfully}} {{applied for}} the job of assistant professional at Bedford School, which he held throughout the summer term. The work mainly consisted of working as a groundsman and bowling in the nets, which left him exhausted and unhappy. Living away from home from the first time and working in a public <b>school</b> <b>environment</b> left him feeling socially out of his depth and he did not enjoy his cricketing duties, although he later admitted that the cricketing strength of the school improved his own batting. In late August, Hobbs returned to Cambridge to play as a professional for the first time. For a fee of ten shillings, he appeared for a team from the nearby town of Royston against Hertfordshire Club and Ground. Appearing in his highest level of cricket to date, Hobbs scored 119. His success delighted his family and made him a local celebrity. Hobbs' father had helped to arrange his appearance in the match but was already seriously ill with pneumonia, and he died a week after his son scored his century, on 3 September 1902. His death left his wife and children facing great financial hardship.|$|E
25|$|In the past, social {{networking}} services {{were viewed as}} a distraction and offered no educational benefit. Blocking these social networks {{was a form of}} protection for students against wasting time, bullying, and invasions of privacy. In an educational setting, Facebook, for example, is seen by many instructors and educators as a frivolous, time-wasting distraction from schoolwork, and {{it is not uncommon to}} be banned in junior high or high school computer labs. Cyberbullying has become an issue of concern with {{social networking}} services. According to the UK Children Go Online survey of 9- to 19-year-olds, it was found that a third have received bullying comments online. To avoid this problem, many school districts/boards have blocked access to social networking services such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter within the <b>school</b> <b>environment.</b> Social networking services often include a lot of personal information posted publicly, and many believe that sharing personal information is a window into privacy theft. Schools have taken action to protect students from this. It is believed that this outpouring of identifiable information and the easy communication vehicle that social networking services opens the door to sexual predators, cyberbullying, and cyberstalking. In contrast, however, 70% of social media using teens and 85% of adults believe that people are mostly kind to one another on social network sites.|$|E
