The home kit was only worn this season, and re-introduced blue socks in favour of white {{for the first time}} since 1967-68.

5000|$|When Riverside A.F.C. {{was formed}} in 1899, the club used a chocolate-brown and gold {{checkered}} shirt. Following the club's name change to Cardiff City 1908, their home colours have consisted of a blue shirt and white or blue shorts and socks, although {{for the first nine}} years black socks were used. In 1919, Cardiff reverted to blue socks with a white hoop and from 1926 Cardiff used a turquoise blue with a white collar, until 1930 when the darker blue was re-introduced. In 1936 the club adopted white <b>sleeves.</b> <b>Kit</b> changes over the club's history have included all blue kits, the introduction of a yellow vertical strip during the 1970s and alternating blue stripes. In 2012, Cardiff controversially changed their home kit colours from the traditional blue, white and yellow to red and black. The crest was also changed to one in which the Welsh dragon was more prominent than the traditional bluebird. The crest was changed to [...] "appeal in 'international markets'". The change angered fans, who expressed their opposition in news and social media as well as directly to management. On 9 January 2015, after three season playing in the red kit, the club reverted their home kit back to blue with a red away kit.|$|R

50|$|The club {{released}} {{the design of}} their inaugural home and away shirts on December 5, 2013. The kit manufacturer was Italian sportswear company Lotto, with UC Davis Children’s Hospital as the shirt sponsor through the 2016 season. The home kit’s dominant color is the club’s signature color “Old Glory Red,” and the away shirt is primarily white. Both Lotto kits featured a diagonal stripe of dark maroon, with the club crest positioned {{on the left side}} of the wearer’s chest. The club’s motto, “Urbs Indomita,” was printed on the right <b>sleeve.</b> The third <b>kit,</b> unveiled before the 2015 season and US Open Cup, featured horizontal eggshell and white stripes and a star over the crest to commemorate the previous season's USL Championship.|$|R
5000|$|The {{national}} kits of Poland {{reflect the}} colors of the national flag which are white and red. Apart from minor details (in the 1920s the socks in the home kit were striped), the design remains unchanged since 1921. The home kit consists of a white shirt, red shorts and white socks; the away kit is all red (though sometimes worn with white shorts). On the rare occasions when both home and away kits clash with the opponent's, a colours third kit is available, usually in either black or blue (currently navy blue with white-red <b>sleeves).</b> The <b>kit</b> has traditionally been adorned with the white eagle (until 2006, the coat of arms featured the inscription [...] "POLSKA" [...] in capital letters above the eagle), the Polish coat of arms, and not, as with many other national teams, the national football federation logo. (The Euro 2012 kits were the first to feature the logo of the PZPN, however, when the kit was first launched it did not include the iconic coat of arms with the white eagle. After only a few matches, the Coat of arms made its return on the national kits.) Since 2009, the current kits are provided by Nike.|$|R
25|$|Umbro will {{manufacture}} the kits for Lyon. Umbro {{have been}} the official kit provider of Lyon since 2003 and, two years ago, signed an extension with Lyon until 2013. This season, Lyon will have brand-new home, away, Champions League kits, which were revealed to the public on 12 July, despite the shirts leaking on 17 June. The home shirt has a white base color, with the horizontal red and blue stripe in the middle, reverting from the club's red and blue vertical stripe {{that has been used}} in previous years. The logo of Umbro appears on the top-right of the shirt in blue. The away shirt features a black and red design. The top part of the shirt is black and it fades horizontally in the middle into red. The shirt has a partly red collar, and also has red details on the black <b>sleeves.</b> The European <b>kit</b> is midnight blue with the horizontal red and blue stripe locating {{in the middle of the}} shirt.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionBefore IS- 1 (3. 2 mm) {{standardization}} of pacemaker leads and connectors, 5 / 6 mm connector ports accomodated 5 mm or 6 mm diameter lead connector pins. Case reportA patient with sick sinus syndrome underwent implantation of a 5 mm unipolar atrial lead, mated to a 5 / 6 mm connector port Medtronic Spectrax Sx 5985 pacemaker. Pulse generator reached ERI in 2006, with change {{out to a}} Medtronic Sigma SSR 306 (5 / 6 mm connector port) and preservation of the 5 mm lead. She was admitted in 2010 for atrial lead non capture from blood leak and corrosion of the header-connector pin apparatus. Discussion 5 / 6 mm pacemaker header ports have a 5 mm flexible sealing ring at the port entrance to seal 5 mm or 6 mm lead connector pins. The inner barrel diameter of the connector port is 6 mm and insertion of a 5 mm lead results in a 0. 5 mm tolerance circumferentially. Should the seal be compromised, blood can corrode the apparatus. To minimize this, we can employ (a) a cinching tie to further seal the silicone ring (b) universal adaptor <b>sleeves</b> (c) splice <b>kits</b> (d) lead adaptor kits. Aging leads, adaptor <b>kits</b> or <b>sleeves</b> themselves can result in lead failure. It may be safer to re-implant the entire system. ConclusionA 5 / 6 mm configuration pacemaker header connector port allows for significant tolerances when a 5 mm lead is used. Consideration {{must be made to}} prevent leaks...|$|R

40|$|A 12 track, 45 minute {{album of}} {{original}} recorded works released under the project name 'Sleeps in Oysters'. Lo! {{was released in}} a glossy card gatefold sleeve with each standard edition accompanied by a hand-illustrated insert depicting each of the 12 animal masks featured in the album photography as a cross stitch chart. 50 hand numbered special edition packs were available each {{with one of the}} 12 animal masks featured on the <b>sleeve,</b> and a <b>kit</b> consisting of threads, fabric and thimble to enable the owner to ‘stitch their own’ matching miniature cross stitch. Lisa has been cross-stitching each of the 12 animal masks from date of release and her progress in photos can be followed on the Sleeps in Oysters blog. The album Lo! can be read as an exhaustive dissection of the perceived norms of both pop song, and pop album structures. Various tracks subvert the expectations of length, structure and placement of sung elements within the wider musical composition; whilst others present themselves in numerous parts over a number of tracks. The structure of the album itself is a deliberate attempt to dictate a pre-ordained ‘order’ against the perceived norms for CD album (with an uninterrupted trajectory with no forced ‘side turn’ as with vinyl LPs and cassette tapes) or digitally downloaded album (which allows complete listener control in the choice and order of tracks played), the forms in which this release was made available. Additionally the order presents two voices from within the collaborative project on two, purely imagined ‘sides’ of the release, as if they were concurrent not coherent. Indeed its name is a deliberately ‘humorous’ reference to Bowie’s Low - an unusual pop precedent for the album presenting two distinct sets of repertoire. This album and wider body of work by Sleeps in Oysters seeks to undermine pre-conceived roles of voices and instruments that imply hierarchical relationships between constituent parts of song compositions. They draw on and amalgamate concepts and processes from popular music and a spectrum of electronic music and sound art, allowing the lyrical and melodic content of songs to sit amidst experimental sound worlds. A key feature of the sonic landscape is the use of ‘found sounds’, and their intricate cutting and placement to form dense collages. This approach is reflected in use of found materials to create elaborate and bespoke physical packaging for their releases. As musical artefacts, inextricably connected sonic and physical works, they question the value of physical artefacts in the post-digital musical climate. Track Listing 1.
