40|$|Amdahl's Law {{dictates}} that in parallel applications <b>serial</b> <b>sections</b> establish an upper {{limit on the}} scalability. Asymmetric chip multiprocessors with a large core in addition to several small cores have been advocated for recently as a promising design paradigm because the large core can accelerate the execution of <b>serial</b> <b>sections</b> and hence mitigate the scalability bottlenecks due to large <b>serial</b> <b>sections.</b> This paper studies the scalability {{of a set of}} data mining workloads that have negligible <b>serial</b> <b>sections.</b> The formulation of Amdahl's Law, that optimistically assumes constant <b>serial</b> <b>sections,</b> estimates these workloads to scale to hundreds of cores in a chip multiprocessor (CMP). However the overhead in carrying out merging (or reduction) operations makes scalability to peak at lesser number. We establish this by extending the Amdahl's speedup model to factor in the impact of reduction operations on the speedup of applications on symmetric as well as asymmetric CMP designs. Our analytical model estimates that asymmetric CMPs with one large and many tiny cores are only optimal for applications with a low reduction overhead. However, as the overhead starts to increase, the balance is shifted towards using fewer but more capable cores. This eventually limits the performance advantage of asymmetric over symmetric CMPs...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{significance}} of techniques used for detecting micro-metastasis (MM) or isolated tumor cells (ITCs) is a controversial issue among investigators. We evaluated the different techniques used on sentinel lymph node (SLN) to detect MM/ITCs. Materials and Methods: Ninety-one SLNs of 15 patients underwent <b>serial</b> <b>section</b> with 100 ΅m interval. In each level, two sections were prepared. One section was stained with H&E and another with anti-cytokeratin antibody (immunohistochemistry). Then the sections were evaluated for detecting MM/ITCs. Results {{were analyzed by}} chi-square test. Results: 1656 sections of 91 SLNs of 15 patients were evaluated by a pathologist; MM was found in 1 and ITCs in 1 case. Overall, 2 out of 15 cases (13. 3 % of the patients) showed MM/ITCs by IHC staining. So, <b>serial</b> <b>section</b> along with using IHC was superior than <b>serial</b> <b>section</b> and routine H&E staining. But it {{did not affect the}} 5 -year survival of the patients (P = 0. 47). Conclusion: Using the combined techniques of <b>serial</b> <b>section</b> and IHC staining could up-stage 13. 3 % of colon cancer patients who were lymph node negative. In other studies with different combination of <b>serial</b> <b>section,</b> IHC staining, and PCR, investigators were able to find MM/ITCs in 3 - 39 % of the cases. In our study, although <b>serial</b> <b>section</b> and IHC staining could up-stage 13. 3 % of patients, it could not affect the 5 -year survival of the patients...|$|E

40|$|For {{three-dimensional}} {{observation of}} the internal structure of hard materials, we developed an automated system based on <b>serial</b> <b>sectioning</b> with precision cutting and optical microscopy. The elliptical vibration cutting device in the system created mirrored surfaces suitable for optical microscopy during the <b>serial</b> <b>sectioning</b> of steel materials. In this study, high-speed sectioning with several micron thickness and repeated precise machining to depths of up to around 1 mm were achieved with a flat-edge cutting tool. For a 3 x 3 mm area of bearing steel, a mirrored surface could be created in about 1 minute, and 400 <b>serial</b> <b>sectioning</b> images were obtained within 7 hours without additional machining processes such as cleaning or changing of tools. The three-dimensional shapes and positions of continuously distributed inclusions found deep within the bearing steels, as well as cracks originating from these inclusions, could be detected with resolutions as high as 80 x 80 nm and in a wide field of view using this system...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} {{and distribution of}} mechanoreceptors in the cranial cruciate ligament of the cat (analogous to the anterior cruciate ligament in other species) was studied histologically using a modified celloidin embedding technique to achieve <b>serial</b> <b>sectioning</b> of bone-ligament-bone preparations with gold chloride staining. We identified distinctive large elongated structures situated between the collagen bundles of the ligament (resembling endings described as Freeman and Wyke type III; also termed Golgi tendon receptors). These endings were found near {{the middle of the}} ligament well away from the bone-ligament junction. Axons seen entering only one end of each type III ending helped to confirm its neural basis. While we saw structures resembling types I and II endings (i. e. Ruffini and pacinian endings, respectively) in individual <b>sections,</b> <b>serial</b> <b>sections</b> failed to reveal convincing evidence of their existence. Such structures almost always appeared to be vascular in nature on adjacent sections, with vessels entering and exiting. We conclude that <b>serial</b> <b>sections</b> are critical to interpreting {{the presence or absence of}} mechanoreceptors...|$|R

30|$|Volume {{electron}} microscopy technique can study cellular ultrastructure {{in three dimensions}} (3 D), which provides more information compared to the 2 D projection or single slice. The transmission {{electron microscopy}} (TEM)-based volume EM methods include electron tomography (ET) (Hart 1968; Koster et al. 1992), serial sectioning followed by TEM (ssTEM) (Harris et al. 2006), and <b>serial</b> <b>section</b> ET (Ladinsky et al. 1999). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-based volume EM methods include <b>serial</b> <b>section</b> SEM (ssSEM) (Horstmann et al. 2012), serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) (Denk and Horstmann 2004), and focus ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) (Knott et al. 2008). For a small volume (50  ×  50  ×  30  μm 3), FIB-SEM approach provides an efficient and automatic {{way to get the}} 3 D ultrastructure of specimen with a higher axial resolution in comparison to serial section-based techniques and SBF-SEM (Peddie and Collinson 2014; Li et al. 2016).|$|E
40|$|The {{methods of}} thin {{sectioning}} of samples of biological material for electron microscopic observation have improved during {{recent years to}} the extent that it is now feasible to cut, mount, and examine an intact strip of <b>serial</b> <b>sections</b> (Porter and Blum, 1953; Gay and Anderson, 1954; Karrer, 1954; Williams and Kallman, 1954). The purpose of examining micrographs of <b>serial</b> <b>sections</b> is to enable one to reconstruct in three dimensions the structural details initially contained in an appreciable depth of the sectioned material. Since the observation of a single, non-serial section yields essentially two-dimensional information only, it may be anticipated that much additional insight into cellular structure can be obtained by the addition of a third dimension. When <b>serial</b> <b>sections</b> are examined, however, some apparently puzzling observations are encountered which make a complete and detailed three-dlmensional reconstruction impossible. We have investigated the origins of these anomalies, and in so doing have been led into examining in some detail the more general problem of the interpretation of electro...|$|R
5000|$|Misreading of the {{pathology}} slide. It {{is difficult to}} differentiate between a small island of basal cell carcinoma and a hair follicle structure. Many Mohs surgeons limit their tissue processing to include only 2 sections of tissue. This severely hampers their ability {{to determine if a}} structure is a hair follicle or a carcinoma. Two histologic sections can not fully distinguish these two nearly identical structures, and can lead to either [...] "false negative" [...] or [...] "false positive" [...] errors by either calling a section clear of tumor, or calling a section positive for tumor, respectively. <b>Serial</b> <b>sectioning</b> of the tumor is preferred by other surgeons. Surgeons who perform <b>serial</b> <b>sectioning</b> through the block of tissue (usually 100 micrometres apart) are assured of the contiguous nature of his tumor and the distance of the tumor from the surgical margin, and are familiarized with the nature of the tumor. <b>Serial</b> <b>sectioning</b> also makes it easier to work with three-dimensional tumor with margins that are difficult to compress.|$|R

40|$|Providing the {{detailed}} 3 D {{structure of the}} full set of neurons and synapses in an organism is a fundamental prob-lem in neuroscience. For performing such 3 D reconstruc-tion at nanoscale, <b>serial</b> <b>section</b> Electron Microscopy has been proven as the only existing technique. However, this technique produces Terabytes of imaging data which ana-lyzing those images manually is an extremely time consum-ing task. To reconstruct each single neuron, one needs to manually annotate and track the neuron through a stack consisting of thousands of images. This manual annotation constitutes the main bottleneck in the 3 D reconstruction workflow. In this thesis we have introduced a novel ap-proach to reduce the human effort needed in this technique. We compute segmentations based on the output of predic-tors for low-level features, such as cell membrane and in-ternal cell structures using Graph-Cut algorithm. We have extended the standard Graph-Cut algorithm to incorporate information from neighboring layers to make the segmen-tations consistent between layers.

Some surgeons utilize 100 micrometres between each section, and some utilize 200 micrometres between the first two sections, and 100 micrometres between subsequent sections (10 crank of tissue set at 6 to 10 micrometre is roughly equal to 100 micrometres if one allows for physical compression due to the blade).|$|R

40|$|Motivation: <b>Serial</b> <b>section</b> {{microscopy}} is {{an established}} method for detailed anatomy reconstruction of biological specimen. During the last decade, high resolution electron microscopy (EM) of serial sections {{has become the}} de-facto standard for reconstruction of neural connectivity at ever increasing scales (EM connectomics). In <b>serial</b> <b>section</b> microscopy, the axial dimension of the volume is sampled by physically removing thin sections from the embedded specimen and subsequently imaging either the block-face or the section series. This process has limited precision leading to inhomogeneous non-planar sampling of the axial dimension of the volume which, in turn, results in distorted image volumes. This includes that section series may be collected and imaged in unknown order. Results: We developed methods to identify and correct these distortions through image-based signal analysis without any additional physical apparatus or measurements. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods in proof of principle experiments and application to real world problems.

40|$|Volumetric (3 d) {{images are}} {{acquired}} for many scientific and biomedical purposes using imaging {{methods such as}} <b>serial</b> <b>section</b> microscopy, CT scans, and MRI. A frequent step in the analysis and reconstruction of such data is the alignment and registration of images that were acquired in succession along a spatial or temporal dimension. For example, in <b>serial</b> <b>section</b> electron microscopy, individual 2 d sections are imaged via electron microscopy and then must be aligned {{to one another in}} order to produce a coherent 3 d volume. State of the art approaches find image correspondences derived from patch matching and invariant feature detectors, and then solve optimization problems that rigidly or elastically deform series of images into an aligned volume. Here we show how fully convolutional neural networks trained with an adversarial loss function can be used for two tasks: (1) synthesis of missing or damaged image data from adjacent sections, and (2) fine-scale alignment of block-face electron microscopy data. Finally, we show how these two capabilities can be combined in order to produce artificial isotropic volumes from anisotropic image volumes using a super-resolution adversarial alignment and interpolation approach...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{histological}} {{detection of}} {{axillary lymph node}} tumor metastases in cases of breast carcinoma is of major prognostic significance, but may be difficult when metastases are of microscopic size. The micrometastases can be detected either by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or <b>serial</b> <b>sectioning.</b> Aims: We investigated whether immunohistochemical techniques and <b>serial</b> <b>sectioning</b> can increase the accuracy of metastatic detection and compared the efficacy of both. Materials and Methods: Thirty cases of breast carcinoma were studied in all of whom the axillary lymph nodes had been reported as free of metastases. Blocks from these cases were serially sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and a single section was stained with monoclonal antibody to cytokeratin AE 1 /AE 3 and epithelial membrane antigen. The positivity for micrometastases was correlated with size, number, grade and histological type of primary tumor, lymph node size and number. Results and Conclusion: In 5 / 30 previously unsuspected cases, micrometastases were revealed by IHC and in 1 / 30 by <b>serial</b> <b>sectioning.</b> These findings suggested that <b>serial</b> <b>sectioning</b> is a labor intensive, time consuming and impractical procedure. Micrometastases were more frequently detected with age of patient > 50 years, Grade 2 / 3 tumor, tumor size > 5 cm {{and more than one}} primary tumor.

30|$|Uveitis {{may be the}} {{presenting}} sign of sarcoidosis, and {{is present}} in about 20 % of cases[9]. Although typical ocular signs such as granulomatous iridocyclitis, retinal periphlebitis, and chorioretinitis are clinical clues to the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, other diagnoses such as tuberculosis, syphilis, and primary intraocular lymphoma may present in a similar fashion[10 – 12]. Conjunctival follicles {{have been reported in}} 7 % to 17 % of patients with ocular sarcoidosis[13, 14]. Crick et al. first popularized directed biopsy of these follicles, with a yield of 24 % to 36 %[5, 15]. Since then, debate has remained about performing directed versus non-directed biopsies, and little consensus exists regarding the optimal method of histologic sectioning. In the literature, some institutions performed 5 to 6 <b>serial</b> <b>sections</b> at three levels[1] whereas others performed 10 <b>serial</b> <b>sections</b> at 6 different levels for a total of 60 sections[2].
