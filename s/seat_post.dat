The upper attachment point must be compatible with the rail configuration (though the two-rail 7 mm round configuration is very common), and the lower attachment point must match the diameter of the <b>seat</b> <b>post</b> if not built in. The shape of some unusual saddles also makes them physically incompatible with certain seat posts, clamps, or frames, due to bumping into other parts or blocking adjustment or attachment bolts.|$|E

50|$|When the fore-aft {{adjustment}} {{range of the}} saddle needs further extension than the clamp affords, {{it may be possible}} to add a saddle adjuster. One such adjuster mounts on the existing saddle clamp and allows up to 40mm of increase or decrease in the fore-aft position of the saddle. Another method for increasing the fore-aft adjustment is the swept-back <b>seat</b> <b>post,</b> where the <b>seat</b> <b>post</b> has a curve in it over the six inches or so before the saddle. Because of the gentle sweep of the tube, the top part of the seat-post cannot fit within the seat-tube, so this solution is useful only for high seat positions.|$|E
