The main injury mechanism for rear seated restrained children, aged 3 - 13, who sustained head injuries rated AIS 2 +, {{has been found to}} be the contact of the head with the seat back or with other parts of car interior. Previous studies showed that pre-crash manoeuvres could influence the injury outcome. This thesis quantifies the <b>static</b> <b>belt</b> measurement and the kinematics of child volunteers exposed to steering manoeuvres when restrained on different types of booster cushion. A study was conducted on a test track with 18 children divided into two groups based on their stature. Each child was tested for the <b>static</b> <b>belt</b> measurement on three different booster cushions and performed two steering manoeuvres on each of two of these boosters. Cameras were used to monitor the child during the event. Different parameters were extracted from the videos in order to analyse the kinematics of the child. From the <b>static</b> <b>belt</b> measurement arose that tall children can achieve a better belt fit than short children, especially in terms of shoulder belt position and its “grabbing” effect. The analysis of the kinematics showed that head and torso moved inboard in different ways. The position of the belt on the shoulder was also considered throughout the steering event. The belt slip off the shoulder in 11 trials out of 18 for short children when restrained on the accessory booster, while the slip off occurred only in 2 trials when restrained on integrated booster. For tall children no belt slip off occurred regardless of the type of booster cushion...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDynamic rope brakes are {{integral}} {{elements of the}} standard belaying equipment. They multiply the hand force of the belayer and convert {{a fraction of the}} falling climber’s kinetic energy into thermal energy. As the rope is deflected by the brake, the thermal energy is produced by belt friction. This paper introduces a brake model based on <b>static</b> and viscous <b>belt</b> friction. The contact angles of three different brakes (figure-of-eight, ATC and HMS [Munter hitch]) were determined. These data as well as data taken and/or derived from the literature served as input for the model. The <b>static</b> and viscous <b>belt</b> friction coefficients range between 0. 2 – 0. 3 and 0. 015 – 0. 04, respectively, for the three brakes. Depending on the magnitude of the friction coefficients, three conditions can be distinguished: (1) no rope slip at high friction; (2) rope slip and stop; (3) critical braking; and (4) continuous rope slip (no stop). The window of the friction coefficients between no slip and critical braking is independent of the hand force. However, the smaller the hand force is, the larger are the friction coefficients at no slip and critical braking. Belayers with smaller hand forces should therefore avoid rope brakes with small static and viscous friction coefficients (like the Figure-ofEight) and apply the ATC or HMS...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} if the range of motion (ROM) of knee extension during a Taekwondo kick could be influenced by a single section of passive <b>static</b> stretching. Black <b>belt</b> Taekwondo recreational athletes (n= 12) with no recent injury of the lower limbs were submitted to passive static stretching. The knee extension ROM during the kick and the passive static ROM of the hamstring muscle were analysed before and after the stretching. The stretching caused an increase in joint ROM, but did not result in differences of the knee extension ROM during the Taekwondo kick. KEY-WORDS: Knee extension angle, passive static stretching, range of motion, Taekwondo. Increase of the range of motion (ROM) is an expected response when different techniques of stretching are used. The acute response to stretching has been attributed to viscoelastic properties of the muscle-tendon unit (MTU) (Taylor et al., 1990) and to changes in stretch tolerance (Magnusson et al., 1998). In sports practice, passive static stretching is widel...|$|R
40|$|The {{subsurface}} Oligocene Tikorangi Formation is {{a unique}} and important oil producer in the onshore Waihapa-Ngaere Field, Taranaki Basin, being the only carbonate and fracture-producing reservoir within the basin. Core sample data from seven onshore wells (foredeep megafacies) and a single offshore well (basinal megafacies) are correlated with a suite of sonic and gamma-ray geophysical well log data to derive interpretative carbonate facies for the Tikorangi Formation. Four mixed siliciclastic-carbonate to carbonate facies have been defined: facies A-calcareous siliciclastite (75 % carbonate). Single or interbedded combinations of these facies {{form the basis for}} identifying nine major lithostratigraphic units in the Tikorangi Formation that are correlatable between the eight wells in this study. The Tikorangi Formation accumulated across a shelf-slope-basin margin within a tectonically diversified basin setting, notably involving considerable off-shelf redeposition of sediment into a bounding foredeep. Analysis of gamma, sonic, and resistivity well logs identifies five major episodes of sedimentary evolution. Episode I comprises retrogradational siliciclastic-dominated redeposited units associated with foredeep subsidence. Episode II is a continuation of episode I retrogradation, but with increased mass-redeposited carbonate influx during accelerated foredeep subsidence and relative sea-level rise, the top marking the maximum flooding surface. Episode III involves a progradational sequence comprising relatively pure redeposited carbonate units associated with declining subsidence rates and minimal siliciclastic input, with movement of facies belts basinward. Episode IV consists of prograding aggradation involving essentially <b>static</b> facies <b>belts</b> dominated by often thick, periodically mass-emplaced, carbonate-rich units separated by thin background siliciclastic shale-like units. Episode V is a retrogradational sequence marking the reintroduction of siliciclastic material into the basin following uplift of Mesozoic basement associated with accelerated compressional tectonics along the Australia-Pacific plate boundary, initially diluting and ultimately extinguishing carbonate production factories and terminating deposition of the Tikorangi Formation...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 49 dynamic sled tests were {{performed}} with the Hybrid III 10 YO to examine issues relating to child belt fit. The goals of these tests were to evaluate ATD response to realistic belt geometries and belt fit, develop methods for accurate, repeatable evaluation of restraint conditions for older children, identify dependent measures that differentiate between good and poor restraint performance, and relate ATD performance to <b>static</b> <b>belt</b> fit with children. The first series of tests {{examined the effects of}} lap belt tension, belt configuration, and seating procedure on dynamic responses of the ATD. The second series of tests examined how different designs of booster seat lap belt guides and shoulder belt guides affect performance. In addition, the ATD’s response to different shoulder belt and lap belt geometries was evaluated. With regard to test procedures, use of a lap/shoulder belt with a sliding latchplate produced similar results to using a lap/shoulder belt with fixed anchorages. Use of a production retractor reduced shoulder belt load, as well as head, neck, and chest measures. Reducing lap belt tension to a more realistic 2 lb (rather than 15 lb) did not have a pronounced effect on ATD kinematics with two different booster seats. The UMTRI seating procedure, which produces ATD postures closer to those measured in real children, also prevents the lap belt from being trapped in the gap between the pelvis and the thigh. Use of the UMTRI seating procedure produces more reclined initial postures and more pronounced chin-to-chest contact. A well-designed booster lap belt guide can maintain good belt position dynamically, even with poor lap belt geometry. Shoulder belt guide designs affect ATD kinematics. However, preventing the shoulder belt from coming out of the shoulder belt guide does not necessarily produce better restraint performance, because the belt can still come off of the ATD shoulder during the event, and stiffening booster seats does not necessarily produce better routing of the shoulder belt dynamically. Shoulder belt scores less than 70 mm produce good torso kinematics with the 10 YO ATD, but use of HIC as an injury criterion tends to discourage booster seat designs that produce good belt fit on the 10 YO ATD. Lap belt angle affects torso kinematics, with shallower lap belt angles leading to submarining and more vertical lap belt angles leading to rollout. Wider spacing of lap belt anchorages leads to submarining, while narrowing spacing leads to rollout. Both upper and lower belt anchorage locations have a strong effect on ATD kinematics. Although good booster designs can mitigate the consequences of poor vehicle lap belt geometry, boosters cannot always overcome poor shoulder belt geometry to keep the belt on the ATD shoulder dynamically, even when they are able to create good <b>static</b> <b>belt</b> fit. This finding suggests that more attention should be focused on the effects of the wide variability in vehicle upper anchorage locations on belt restraint performance for children. Also, because HIC scores are decreased when the torso belt fit is degraded, use of HIC as an injury criterion for booster testing may lead to worse rather than better booster designs...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} sled tests was {{conducted}} to examine the performance of booster seats under belt geometries representing the range found in the rear seats of current vehicles. Twelve tests were performed with the standard 6 YO Hybrid III ATD and 29 tests were performed with {{a modified version of}} the 6 YO ATD. The modified dummy has a pelvis with more realistic shape and flesh stiffness, a gel abdomen with biomechanically-based stiffness characteristics, and a custom neoprene jacket. Shoulder belt upper anchorage was set at the FMVSS No. 213 belt anchorage location and 64 mm inboard and outboard from this location. Lap belt anchorage locations were chosen to span the range of lap belt angles permitted under FMVSS 210, using the FMVSS No. 213 belt anchorage locations and forward belt anchorage locations that produce a much steeper lap belt angle. Four booster seats that provide a range of <b>static</b> <b>belt</b> fit were used. The ATDs were positioned using either the standard FMVSS No. 213 seating procedure or an alternate UMTRI procedure that produces postures closer to those of similar-size children. Kinematic results for the standard and modified dummies under the same test conditions were more similar than expected. The current version of the modified 6 YO is less sensitive to lap belt geometry than the prototype version of the dummy. The seating procedure had a greater affect on kinematic results. The UMTRI seating procedure produced greater knee-head excursion differences and less forward torso rotation than the FMVSS No. 213 procedure. Shifting the shoulder belt upper anchorage 128 mm laterally produced minimal variations in kinematics for a given booster seat/lap belt condition, likely because the belt-routing features of the booster seats limited the differences in static shoulder belt score to less than 10 mm. Moving the lap belt geometry from rearward (shallow angle) to forward (steep angle) produced less desirable kinematics with all booster seats tested. The forward position of the lap belt anchorage allows greater forward translation of the booster and ATD before the belt engages the pelvis. Steeper belt angles are associated with better lap belt fit for children sitting without boosters, so designing rear seat belts for children who sit with and without boosters may involve a performance tradeoff...|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} <b>static</b> {{electron}} radiation <b>belt</b> models, space weather prediction tools, and energetic electron datasets {{are used by}} spacecraft designers and operations support personnel as internal charging code inputs to evaluate electrostatic discharge risks in space systems due to exposure to relativistic electron environments. Evaluating the environment inputs is often accomplished by comparing whether the data set or forecast tool reliability predicts measured electron flux (or fluence over a given period) for some chosen period. While this technique is useful as a model metric, it does not provide the information necessary to evaluate whether short term deviances of the predicted flux {{is important in the}} charging evaluations. In this paper, we use a 1 -D internal charging model to compute electric fields generated in insulating materials as a function of time when exposed to relativistic electrons in the Earth's magnetosphere. The resulting fields are assumed to represent the "true" electric fields and are compared with electric field values computed from relativistic electron environments derived from a variety of space environment and forecast tools. Deviances in predicted fields compared to the "true" fields which depend on insulator charging time constants will be evaluated as a potential metric for determining the importance of predicted and measured relativistic electron flux deviations over a range of time scales...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Direct {{measurement}} of building ventilation rate in livestock housing {{is a formidable}} task due to uncontrollable variations in fan and system performance that are caused by factors such as building <b>static</b> pressure, fan <b>belt</b> slippage, and dust accumulation on shutters and blades. Estimating building ventilation rate by an indirect method based on a CO 2 balance offers a potentially viable alternative to direct measurement. The validity of the CO 2 balance method depends on the validity of relationship between CO 2 production inside the building and metabolic rate of the animals and the knowledge of CO 2 generation by the housing environment. Metabolic rates of modern laying hens have recently been quantified in intensive large−scale laboratory measurements. However, performance of the indirect method remains to be evaluated under field conditions. This article compares building ventilation rates obtained by direct measurement and by a CO 2 balance. The test was conducted at a commercial laying hen house that used manure belts with daily manure removal. The results indicate that ventilation rates estimated by the indirect method {{were not significantly different}} (P> 0. 2) from those as determined by the direct measurement when the averaging or integration time interval was 2 h or longer. Careful application of the indirect method could greatly improve the affordability and versatility of endeavors toward quantifying air emissions from confined animal housing...|$|R
40|$|Discomfort during load {{carriage}} is a {{major issue}} for activities using backpacks (e. g. infantry maneuvers, children carrying school supplies, or outdoor sports). It is currently unclear which mechanical parameters are responsible for subjectively perceived discomfort. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify objectively measured mechanical predictors of discomfort during load carriage. We compared twelve different configurations of a typical load carriage system, a commercially available backpack with a hip belt. The pressure distribution under the hip belt and the shoulder strap, as well as the tensile force in the strap and the relative motion of the backpack were measured. Multiple linear regression analyses were con-ducted to investigate possible predictors of discomfort. The results demonstrate that static peak pressure, or alternatively, static strap force is a significant (p< 0. 001) predictor of dis-comfort during load carriage in the shoulder and hip region, accounting for 85 % or more of the variation in discomfort. As an additional finding, we discovered that the regression coef-ficients of these predictors are significantly smaller for the hip than for the shoulder region. As static peak pressure is measured directly on the body, it is less dependent on the type of load carriage system than static strap force. Therefore, static peak pressure is well suited as a generally applicable, objective mechanical parameter for the optimization of load car-riage system design. Alternatively, when limited to load carriage systems of the type back-pack with hip <b>belt,</b> <b>static</b> strap force is the most valuable predictor of discomfort. The regionally differing regression coefficients of both predictors imply that the hip region is sig-nificantly more tolerant than the shoulder region. In order to minimize discomfort, users should be encouraged to shift load from the shoulders to the hip region wherever possible, at the same time likely decreasing the risk of low back pain or injury...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} part of an NRF {{sponsored}} research project entitled “Neotectonics and its applications for the exploration of groundwater in the fractured Karoo aquifers in the Eastern Cape” under the NRF Niche area of Water Resources Management and Sustainable Development in the Eastern Cape Province. The identification of relatively highly productive wells in the Karoo fractured aquifers is extremely difficult. This study aims to identify neotectonic zones and lower stress fields, and apply the results to groundwater exploration in the Eastern Cape Province. The methodologies adopted in this study include: a comprehensive literature review, extensive field mapping and investigation such as road cuts, sampling for laboratory studies, examination of seismic data, study of hot and ordinary springs, and interpretation of aerial photography and satellite images. Three main neotectonic belts were identified in the Eastern Cape (southern neotectonic belt, northern neotectonic belt and eastern neotectonic belt) based on literature review and field interpretations. The southern neotectonic belt (from the Cape Fold Belt to the lower Beaufort Group boundary) is characterized by the reactivation of the Coega-Bavianskloof and Sauer faults, the presence of a hot spring near Fort Beaufort, the slickenlines and discrete slickenlines and specifically the seismic events that were recorded in the Eastern Cape from 1850 to 2007. In this southern neotectonic belt the remote sensing has also revealed the presence of the Fort Beaufort fracture, the quartz veins seen in some dolerites and the different vegetation types along it may indicate that this fracture is possibly a fault; moreover the Quaternary sediments and weathered dolerites indicate that the Fort iii Beaufort fracture is characterized by groundwater circulation and accordingly is a good target for groundwater exploration, this fracture is a post-Karoo structure and possibly a neotectonic feature. In addition, the kaolin deposit, chiefly developed in the Dwyka tillite near Grahamstown is clearly controlled by neotectonic fracture zones. The northern neotectonic belt near the country of Lesotho is marked by the presence of the Senqu seismotectonic regime and hot springs. The Quaternary Amatole-Swaziland (formerly Ciskei-Swaziland) axis of uplift makes {{the eastern part of the}} province the third neotectonic zone, the asymmetric meanders of the Mbashe river in the vicinity of Qunu near Mthatha derived possibly from this Quaternary uplift; this asymmetric feature of meanders implies that the river has tried to maintain stability of its valley where tilting occurred. Within these neotectonic belts the central part of the Eastern Cape may be considered a <b>static</b> and inactive <b>belt.</b> A northwesterly trend for the maximum principal compresssional stress predominates in the Eastern Cape and is correlated with the present major structural control of the province. The current stress regime determination was derived from faults, joints and quartz veins only on kaolin deposits. Systematic joints reflect regional tectonic stress trajectories at the time of fracturing. Discharge rates of groundwater from boreholes as provided by the Department of Water and Forestry were used to confirm and predict water exploration targets. The region of Tabankulu (near Kwazulu Natal) in the northern neotectonic belt has remarkable discharge rates of groundwater (11. 1 l/s, 4. 65 l/s, 6. 49 l/s, 42 l/s). The region of Mthatha, nearly surrounding the Amatole-Swaziland axis (former Ciskei-Swaziland iv axis) of uplift which might have generated some new faults, has a number of springs. These two regions should serve as case studies for future research. Apart from these two regions, two others regions can be considered as case studies for future groundwater exploration targets: the Bath Farm hot spring near the Fort Beaufort neotectonic fault and the vicinity of what is known as the Fort Beaufort fracture near Teba and Cimezile villages 20 km north west of Fort Beaufort. It is concluded that the study of neotectonics and stress fields may be a useful tool for groundwater exploration in the Karoo fractured aquifers in the Eastern Cape, and in similar regions elsewhere in South Africa and in Africa...|$|R
40|$|This study {{interprets the}} stratigraphic {{evolution}} of the mid-Cretaceous Urgonian Carbonate Platform sensu lato exposed in the northwestern Subalpine Chains of southeast France within a framework of dynamic environmental and climatic changes including relative sea-level fluctuations. Macroscopic observations of stratal geometries, especially stratal packaging within the succession revealed by differential weathering patterns have been integrated with the petrographic examination of limestone samples {{to assist in the}} interpretation of the carbonate succession. Seven hundred and twenty-eight rock samples were examined under the microscope as either thin sections or acetate peels and twenty five component parameters were used to define sediment composition within the data set. New and emerging analytical techniques have been used to interpret these data rather than the more traditional <b>static</b> fixed facies <b>belts.</b> Sequence stratigraphic concepts have been used to interpret platform evolution within the context of relative sea-level changes. In order to define microfacies and identify underlying environmental gradients computer optimized Jaccard's similarity coefficients matrices have been calculated between samples and component parameters using two computer programs SedUtil and JaccMat run on an IBM compatible Pentium personal computer. Computer optimized Jaccard's similarity coefficients similarity matrices are able to model both gradational and abrupt changes in facies composition in response to palaeogeographic and stratigraphic controls. Computer optimized similarity matrices between limestone compositional parameters from a series of logs show differences in the spatial and temporal nature of variations in sediment composition in response to environmental changes across the platform. The contrasts between the configurations of optimized similarity matrices are interpreted as indicating a palaeogeography {{at the beginning of the}} Urgonian characterised by a more strongly subsident basin to the southeast of the field area connected to the topographically-higher, tectonically more stable parts of the platform by low-angle slopes; the basin was eliminated by the end of the Urgonian. In addition optimized similarity matrices calculated between samples have been used to assist in defining eight-eight conventional microfacies assemblages which are described and illustrated using photomicrographs and pie-diagrams of modal composition. Despite the apparently conformable nature of the succession as observed in individual exposures, changes in the stratigraphy of the Urgonian platform sensu lata as traced along two southwest-northeast transects constructed through the Aravis and Bargy Chains indicate the existence of a low-angle distally steepened ramp topography at the top of the Hauterivian basement that sloped into a more strongly subsident basin. The Urgonian succession is divided into two third-order depositional sequences termed Depositional Sequence 1 and 2. In Depositional Sequence 1 all three systems tract are developed whereas Depositional Sequence 2 only contains transgressive and highstand systems tracts. The lowstand systems tract of Depositional Sequence 1 preserved in the southwest of the Aravis and Bargy Subalpine Chains is volumetrically significant, being dominated by hemipelagic deposits that shallow laterally to intertidal deposits to the northeast and also contain calciturbidites and two spectacular megabrecciahorizons. The two megabreccia horizons are interpreted as thin surficial collapse horizons formed by net extension on a very-low angle, previously kinematically stable slope, during fourth-fifth order relative sea-level falls. The lower sequence boundary of Depositional Sequence 1 passes laterally from being conformable in the southwest (deep-water basin) to being a major unconformity in the northeast ('inner' platform). However, this sequence boundary appears planar and concordantly bedded in the main and it is only in the northeastern Bargy Chain that it is observed as a erosional angular unconformity. The top of Depositional Sequence 1 is marked by the end of rudist lagoonal sediments and the deposition of beach facies which contain evidence of grain dissolution, overlain by Orbitolinidae foraminiferal rich horizons. By the top of Depositional Sequence 1 the low angle slope to the southwest had been totally subdued by sediment infilling and/or a decrease in the rate of differential subsidence. Depositional Sequence 1 was terminated by a comparatively minor relative sea-level fall followed by an immediate return to a major third-order relative sea-level rise and the basal transgressive deposits of Depositional 2. Depositional Sequence 2 re-establishes rudist sediment lagoonal deposition on the platform. It is often difficult to differentiate the transgressive and highstand systems tracts from one another in Depositional Sequence 2 and the boundary may be transitional. The upper sequence boundary of Depositional Sequence 2 is marked by a subaerial karst overlain by phosphatic greensands interpreted as reflecting a major relative sea-level fall and subsequent reflooding. Factors unique to carbonate depositional systems and their implications for the use of 'traditional' sequence stratigraphic models for carbonates are also discussed...|$|R
