5|$|A single soldier {{arriving}} in Mexico in 1520 was carrying smallpox and thus initiated the devastating plagues that <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> native {{populations of the}} Americas. The European diseases that ravaged the indigenous inhabitants of the Americas also severely affected the various Maya groups of Petén. It is estimated that there were approximately 30,000 Ch'ol and Ch’olti’ Maya in western Petén {{at the start of}} the 16th century. Between 1559 and 1721 they were devastated by a combination of disease, war and enforced relocations.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the treacherous}} {{conditions}} in which this breed of dog was used, coupled with a succession of accidents, talk of the whole stock becoming extinct was raised as early as 1839. However at some point prior to 1847 a pestilence <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> region and reduced the number down to a single specimen, which forced the canons into crossing it with other breeds.|$|E
5|$|Long ago, King Childeric I came to {{the forest}} to build a city while the Queen experimented with black magic to gain eternal life. A plague <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> land, and she hid in her tower, while her husband and {{everyone}} below her perished. Her spell granted her immortal life, but not the youth and beauty {{to go along with}} it. Her youthful appearance now only exists in her mirror, the source of her life, as an illusion and nothing more.|$|E
5|$|The Second World War {{broke out}} in September 1939 with the German Army's {{invasion}} of Poland. British assurances to the Poles led the British Empire to declare war on Germany. As in the First World War, a relatively-small BEF was sent to France and hastily evacuated from Dunkirk as the German forces <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Low Countries and across France in May 1940.|$|E

5|$|A {{disaster}} {{struck the}} colony on 13 August 2010, when a forest fire <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> breeding site killing three adults and 25 of the 38 chicks. The fire destroyed the vegetation and several nesting burrows. Conservation action {{to protect the}} 13 remaining chicks included removing dead birds and burnt vegetation, reinforcing the surviving nests, and setting poison bait for rats around the now exposed nest sites. In the longer term, the action plan includes the provision of artificial burrows, seed dispersal to help the vegetation recover, {{and the use of}} anti-erosion materials.|$|E
5|$|A single soldier {{arriving}} in Mexico in 1520 was carrying smallpox and initiated the devastating plagues that <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> native {{populations of the}} Americas. Modern estimates of native population decline vary from 75% to 90% mortality. Maya written histories suggest that smallpox was rapidly transmitted throughout the Maya area {{the same year that}} it arrived in central Mexico. Among the most deadly diseases were the aforementioned smallpox, influenza, measles and a number of pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis. Modern knowledge of the impact of these diseases on populations with no prior exposure suggests that 33–50% {{of the population of the}} Maya highlands perished.|$|E
5|$|In 1948 floods <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Columbia watershed, {{destroying}} Vanport, {{then the}} second largest city in Oregon, and impacting cities {{as far north as}} Trail, British Columbia. The flooding prompted the United States Congress to pass the Flood Control Act of 1950, authorizing the federal development of additional dams and other flood control mechanisms. By that time local communities had become wary of federal hydroelectric projects, and sought local control of new developments; a public utility district in Grant County, Washington, ultimately began construction of the dam at Priest Rapids.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} 18th century {{classical}} Palladian architecture <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> Ireland, <b>the</b> {{driving force behind}} this new fashion was the Irish architect Edward Lovett Pearce.

5|$|In 1973, by {{the time}} the Paris Peace Accord was concluded, South Vietnam possessed the fourth largest air force in the world. Despite their size, however, Republic of Vietnam Air Force {{operations}} were severely curtailed due to cutbacks in U.S. military aid. Furthermore, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force were prevented from undertaking reconnaissance and ground support missions due to the threat posed by formidable anti-aircraft weapons deployed by North Vietnam. When the North Vietnamese military renewed their offensive early in 1975, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was virtually handicapped and many of their aircraft were either lost or captured as formations of the Vietnam People's Army <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Central Highlands of South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|In La Pintada, {{a remote}} fishing village of around 400residents {{situated}} {{to the west}} of Acapulco, a mudslide occurred on September14, which within a few minutes, <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> center of town. As such, many residents initially wandered throughout town in a state of panic and confusion; it took two days for word of the mudslide to spread to the public. Throughout the village, 71people were killed. Over half the town, including 20homes, were demolished due to the mudslide. A total of 334people were evacuated by police, though 30elected to stay in the area until all the victims had been identified. Many surviving citizens of La Pintada were also hurt, including one seriously.|$|E
5|$|In the 850s, ʿUmar is {{recorded}} as having defeated an expedition {{led by the}} Byzantine emperor Michael III (r. 842–867) against Samosata, and to have carried {{out a number of}} successful raids into Byzantium. One of them <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> themes of Thrakesion and Opsikion and reached up to the great Byzantine army base of Malagina in Bithynia. He was unable, however, to stop a retaliatory expedition launched in 856 by Petronas against Melitene and Tephrike, which raided all the way to Amida, taking many prisoners before returning home.|$|E

5|$|The Great Fire of London {{broke out}} in 1666 in Pudding Lane {{in the city and}} quickly <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> wooden buildings. Rebuilding took over ten years and was {{supervised}} by Robert Hooke as Surveyor of London. In 1708 Christopher Wren's masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral was completed. During the Georgian era, new districts such as Mayfair were formed in the west; new bridges over the Thames encouraged development in South London. In the east, the Port of London expanded downstream. London's development as an international financial centre matured for much of the 1700s.|$|E
5|$|The Great Fire of London {{was a major}} {{conflagration}} that <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> central {{parts of}} the English city of London from Sunday, 2 September to Wednesday, 5 September 1666. The fire gutted the medieval City of London inside the old Roman city wall. It threatened but did not reach the aristocratic district of Westminster, Charles II's Palace of Whitehall, {{and most of the}} suburban slums. It consumed 13,200 houses, 87 parish churches, St Paul's Cathedral, and most of the buildings of the City authorities. It is estimated to have destroyed the homes of 70,000 of the City's 80,000 inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|The evacuation, {{which had}} been delayed for months, was {{initiated}} due to fear of the Red Army advances during the East Prussian Offensive. Some parts of the evacuation were planned as a military necessity, Operation Hannibal being the most important military operation involved in the evacuation. However, many refugees took to the roads on their own initiative because of reported Soviet atrocities against Germans in the areas under Soviet control. Both spurious and factual accounts of Soviet atrocities were disseminated through the official news and propaganda outlets of Nazi Germany and by rumors that <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> military and civilian populations.|$|E

50|$|The plague {{has never}} died out. From 1896-1918 <b>the</b> plague <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> India, taking <b>the</b> lives of over 12.5 million people. Between 1906 and 1914, the Plague Research Commission was created, and {{published}} supplements to the Journal of Hygiene.|$|R
5|$|While al-Kharrat's men {{managed to}} capture the Azm Palace and the police station in Bab Saghir, al-Bakri led a band of 200 fighters from their base in al-Midan to raid an Armenian refugee camp in al-Qadam, killing several Armenian refugees. The rebels accused the Armenians—who along with the Circassians were {{typically}} allied with the French authorities—of participating in the French military assaults against several Ghouta villages in the preceding weeks. After attacking al-Qadam, al-Bakri's forces <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> city, capturing the police stations at Bab al-Jabiyah, Bab Musalla and Qanawat. With each captured neighborhood, their forces increased in size as enthusiastic bystanders joined in the attacks.|$|E
5|$|CCC Camp S-95, {{which opened}} on May 29, 1933 {{on the site}} of an old lumber camp, was able to {{distinguish}} itself over the years it operated in Sullivan County. Two floods <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> area in 1933 and 1936. The August flood of 1933 caused extensive damage and largely destroyed the newly built camp. During the course of the flooding two young men from Camp S-95 saved the lives of two drowning children at Worlds End State Park. The flood of 1936 covered a large area within the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. The young men of the CCC camp were among the leaders in the cleaning up after the flood and rebuilding many destroyed bridges and roads. In 1936 the park was officially expanded beyond the original small picnic area. Camp S-95 closed in 1941.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{conquest of}} Yucatán was the {{campaign}} {{undertaken by the}} Spanish conquistadores against the Late Postclassic Maya states and polities in the Yucatán Peninsula, a vast limestone plain covering south-eastern Mexico, northern Guatemala, and all of Belize. The Spanish conquest of the Yucatán Peninsula was hindered by its politically fragmented state. The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns. Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements {{took the form of}} the flight into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic. Spanish weaponry included broadswords, rapiers, lances, pikes, halberds, crossbows, matchlocks and light artillery. Maya warriors fought with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows and stones, and wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. The Spanish introduced a number of Old World diseases previously unknown in the Americas, initiating devastating plagues that <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> native populations.|$|E
50|$|A new allele of ASPM arose {{sometime}} in the last 15000 years, {{and it seems to}} have <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> much of <b>the</b> European and Middle-Eastern population. Although the new allele is evidently beneficial, researchers do not know what it does.|$|R
