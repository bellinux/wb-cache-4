Here, Smiles convinces a {{tribe of}} Blackfeet Native Americans that Tintin is their enemy, and when Tintin arrives, he is {{captured}} and threatened with execution. After escaping, Tintin discovers {{a source of}} underground petroleum. The U.S. army then forces the Natives off their land, and oil companies build a city on the site within 24 hours. Tintin evades a lynch mob and a wildfire before discovering Smiles' remote hideaway cabin; after a brief altercation, he captures the gangster.|$|E

5|$|As other {{scenes of}} Carey in the latex mini {{and by the}} large red hone prop are interspersed, the club scene alters to a poker table, where Ealy reveals three of his card, '556', {{completing}} four of the seven digits of Carey phone number. The next scene finds Carey sitting on a large pink sofa in an empty room in the club, sporting only a white man's suit jacket and stilettos. As the song reaches the bridge, Carey is shown back in the club's main room dancing, as she leaves a number '4' on a nearby table for the man to find. As Carey once again {{is shown in the}} yellow latex dress, she walks down a small aisle, placing another card with the number '4' into Ealy's jacket pocket, before storming through the club by several followers. As the video ends, the number '555-6464' are shown lying on a small table, while Carey sits on the large pink sofa, and Ealy is seen on the other side gazing at her. The video concludes with Ealy slowly approaching Carey on the large sofa, as she winks and <b>smiles</b> <b>to</b> the camera.|$|E

During the battle, Cassius has his servant kill him after hearing of the capture of his best friend, Titinius. After Titinius, who was not really captured, sees Cassius's corpse, he commits suicide. However, Brutus wins that stage of the battle, but his victory is not conclusive. With a heavy heart, Brutus battles again the next day. He loses and commits suicide by running on his own sword, held for him by a loyal soldier.|$|E
500|$|Freehance writer Paul De Witte wrote a mixed {{review in}} The Record (now the Waterloo Region Record), writing that {{although}} the book [...] "will certainly find its audience, its Disneyesque sensibilities will kill its broader appeal. The topics of wildlife conservation and global ecological accountability warrant a depth that the author seems unwilling to give her book." [...] Kirkus Reviews referred to the book as [...] "an enlightening cautionary take" [...] and [...] "a charmingly personal account", but also as [...] "loosely organized and occasionally sparse on detail". John Wilkes, in the Los Angeles Times, wrote, [...] "Although naive and overdrawn at times, this heartfelt tale will bring tears and <b>smiles</b> <b>to</b> even the most stubbornly objective reader." [...] Donna Mitchell, writing in The Wilson Bulletin (now The Wilson Journal of Ornithology), wrote that Houle's interpretation of the falcons' behavior is excessively [...] "anthropomorphic", but also that [...] "Ms. Houle's perseverance and dedication {{to the protection of}} the Peregrine Falcon is admirable and an incentive not only to young biologists just getting started but {{to those of us who}} get a little more than discouraged with the struggle to protect endangered species and their habitats." ...|$|E
500|$|Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier {{opined that}} Hergé had made [...] "another leap forward" [...] with Tintin in America, noting {{that while it}} still [...] "rambles on", it is [...] "more tightly plotted" [...] than its predecessors. They {{believed}} that the illustrations showed [...] "marked progress" [...] and {{that for the first}} time, several of the frames could be seen as [...] "individual pieces of art". Believing that it was the first work with the [...] "intangible epic quality" [...] they thought characterised The Adventures of Tintin, they awarded it two out of five stars. They considered Bobby <b>Smiles</b> <b>to</b> be [...] "the first great villain" [...] of the series, and also thought that an incompetent hotel detective featured in the comic was an anticipation of Thomson and Thompson, while another character, the drunken sheriff, anticipated Captain Haddock. The Lofficiers believed that Hergé had successfully synthesised all of the [...] "classic American myths" [...] into a single narrative that [...] "withstands comparison with the vision of America" [...] presented in Gustave Le Rouge and Gustave Guitton's La Conspiration Des Milliardaires (The Billionaires' Conspiracy). They were of the opinion that Hergé's depiction of the exploitation of Native Americans was an [...] "astonishing piece of narrative".|$|E

500|$|The video {{starts with}} a warning saying [...] "no men were harmed {{in the making of}} this video". In the opening, it shows Aguilera playing 1980's {{computer}} games on her computer when she gets an incoming message from an occult fortune teller. Opening the message, she asks [...] "Hey Oranum, what's my week look like?" [...] to which the occult fortune teller responds [...] "You're gonna have a killer week!". Aguilera coyly <b>smiles</b> <b>to</b> the camera and images are shown of Aguilera writhing around seductively on a bed and eating cereal whilst on the couch watching cartoons. In the clip, Aguilera plays a killer who kills men after seducing them. She goes on a ride with the first man and seduces him leading to a make-out session between the two, then after he falls asleep, she blows up his car in electric-pink flames. Next, she goes to a bar and seduces the second man in a bathroom stall, where she bludgeons him to death, leaving spatters of blue paint dripping from the walls. Finally, she seduces a third unlucky suitor (who was foretold by the same occult fortune teller that it was his unlucky day) by inviting him to a motel and then uses a baseball bat to kill him, [...] "showering the room in a mist of red confetti". The video ends with Aguilera washing off the red confetti splattered all over herself while looking in the mirror at her reflection and as the confetti goes down the drain, shows Aguilera in her trailer eating cereal while changing channels on her television set, settling on [...] "The Lucy Show" [...] before smiling and turning off her television. The video features several cultural influences, including the old NES Advantage, the psychic site Oranum.com, and short films of The Lucy Show featuring American actress Lucille Ball.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{reviewed the}} episode, giving it high marks saying it [...] "proves yet again that 30 Rock {{is worthy of}} the Best Comedy Emmy" [...] and scored the episode a 9.2 out of 10. Sean Gandert of Paste magazine also reviewed [...] "Season 4", saying it did [...] "little to disappoint and in fact starts the show off on much stronger footing than the first couple episodes of season 3." [...] Gandert said the episode [...] "doesn't have quite as many truly classic moments as the show's peaks in seasons one and two" [...] but that [...] "it also never really hits a sour note." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad enjoyed the economic crisis, cutbacks, and corporate bonuses theme in the episode, explaining {{that one of the}} reasons he loves the show [...] "is because it can take something that's in the news and make it the plot of an episode without it feeling weird or forced." [...] Sassone wrote that despite [...] "Season 4" [...] not being the best episode of 30 Rock [...] "it was still very good." [...] TV Guides Michael Anthony commented that Steve Buscemi is [...] "so weird and yet does it in such an endearing way." [...] Mary McNamara for the Los Angeles Times called Kenneth's strike one of the more hilarious strikes in history. Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons noted that this episode of 30 Rock had strong moments [...] "and was a solid start to the new season". David Zurawik, a contributor for The Baltimore Sun, liked the episode and enjoyed Buscemi's appearance, noting he [...] "brings just the right mix of sleaze and <b>smiles</b> <b>to</b> the role." [...] The Chicago Sun-Times Paige Wiser noted, [...] "...tonight's season premiere, the hype is warranted: 30 Rock is in all its glory." [...] Kevin Aeh of Time Out magazine wrote that the best part from [...] "Season 4" [...] was Tracy's storyline after being told to reconnect with his roots.|$|E
