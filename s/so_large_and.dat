Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database <b>so</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} market started with comic book stores, and hobby shops displaying and selling cards, with the cards' values determined somewhat arbitrarily {{by the employees}} of the store. With {{the expansion of the}} internet, prices of cards were determined by the amount of tournament deck lists a given card would appear in. If a card was played in a tournament more frequently, the cost of the card would be higher (in addition to the market availability of the card). When eBay, Amazon, and other large online markets started to gain popularity, the Magic {{secondary market}} evolved substantially. Buying and selling Magic cards online became a source of income for people who learned how to manipulate the market. Today, the secondary market is <b>so</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> complex, it has become an area of study for consumer research, and some people make a career out of market manipulation, creating mathematical models to analyze the growth of cards' worth, and predict the market value of both individual cards, and entire sets of cards.|$|E

5|$|In March 1909, Boyce {{embarked}} on a two-month trip to Europe, which included a visit to his daughters, who were in Rome. On returning to America, Boyce organized a photographic expedition to Africa with the innovative aerial photographer George R. Lawrence. Boyce met with safari organizers and outfitters and provisioned his expedition in London and Naples. His son Benjamin and Lawrence's son Raymond {{were part of the}} expedition. Cartoonist John T. McCutcheon joined the expedition while they were sailing from Naples to Africa. The group disembarked at Mombasa, Kenya, and was in Nairobi by September. After hiring local porters and guides, the entire expedition totaled about 400 people, about three-fourths of whom were servants. It required 15 train cars to move the people and equipment to the area the expedition was going to explore near Kijabi and Lake Victoria. The expedition was a failure because a telephoto lens was neither brought nor subsequently procured, the hot air balloons were not suitable for the conditions on the plains of East Africa, and the cameras were <b>so</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> noisy to move into position that the animals were scared away. The members of the expedition had to resort to buying photographs of big game animals from shops in cities such as Nairobi. The expedition did manage to successfully hunt several species of big game animals.|$|E
5|$|In frogs, the {{hind legs}} {{are larger than}} the fore legs, {{especially}} so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming. In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not <b>so</b> <b>large,</b> <b>and</b> the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies. The feet have adaptations for the way of life, with webbing between the toes for swimming, broad adhesive toe pads for climbing, and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging (frogs usually dig backwards into the soil). In most salamanders, the limbs are short and {{more or less the}} same length and project at right angles from the body. Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop, particularly when climbing. In their normal gait, only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors, the lobe-finned fish. Some salamanders in the genus Aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs, large toepads and prehensile tails. In aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles, the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion. Adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones.|$|E

25|$|By {{this time}} the world was in the thralls of an energy crisis. Beginning in 1973, {{the members of the}} Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had taken {{advantage}} of tight world oil supplies to rapidly and regularly increase prices. Policy-makers in the oil consuming countries therefore considered it a matter of national urgency to develop stable, secure energy supplies. Because the resource was <b>so</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> development was clearly possible, the oil sands looked like Canada's best bet. As a result, the prospect that the Syncrude project would collapse was a matter of both political and economic concern.|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, in retrospective, Ibn Tulun's role in {{the wider}} context of Islamic history is as the herald of the Abbasid Caliphate's {{disintegration}} {{and the rise of}} local dynasties in the provinces. This became particularly evident with the succession of Khumarawayh: as Thierry Bianquis explains, [...] "this {{was the first time in}} Abbasid history with regard to the government of <b>so</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> rich a territory, that a wāli, whose legitimacy derived from the caliph who had designated him, was succeeded openly by an amīr who claimed his legitimacy by inheritance". Thus Zaky M. Hassan calls Ibn Tulun a [...] "typical example of the Turkish slaves who from the time of Harun al-Rashid were enlisted in the private service of the caliph and the principal officers of state, and whose ambition and spirit of intrigue and independence [...] them the real masters of Islam".|$|E
500|$|As the {{popularity}} and marketability {{of the natural}} world rose during the late 19th century, books dedicated to nature came to be in great demand. One reviewer noted in 1901 that [...] "It {{is a part of the}} progress of the day that the Nature study is coming into prominence in our schemes of education, and, beyond these, is entering into our plans for coveted diversion, yet it is a real surprise that <b>so</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> increasing a number of each season's publications are devoted to the purpose." [...] Such literature was regularly published in a wide variety of subjects: children's animal books, wilderness novels, nature guides, and travelogues were all immensely popular. The study of nature quickly became part of the public school curriculum, making nature writing increasingly profitable. As the public's hunger for such imaginative works grew, a new genre in which nature was depicted in a compassionate, rather than realistic, light began to take form.|$|E
500|$|Females laid {{their eggs}} inside the water-filled tree holes, {{attached}} to the wood or bark just above the waterline. After laying their eggs, the females left while the males remained to guard them. Males may have mated more than once, and a single tree hole could contain an egg clutch of 60 to 200 eggs. The eggs would hatch into large tadpoles with dorsoventrally flattened bodies and short, blunt snouts. The eyes were situated on top and directed towards the sides. They were not visible when the tadpole was viewed from below. The nostrils were situated about {{two thirds of the}} way between the eyes and snout. The mouth was small and located {{at the bottom of the}} tip of the snout. Small papillae were present along the sides of the upper lip and along the entire margin of the lower lip. The beaks were robust and with small serrations. The spiracle opened on the middle of the left side of the body. The tail was slender with fins that did not extend to the body. The tadpoles were predominantly pale brown in color. At the time when the legs first appeared, they had a snout to vent length of roughly [...] The tadpoles were <b>so</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> numerous that at times, there appeared to be more tadpoles than water in the tree holes.|$|E

The nose of the glider was hinged and opened to the side for ease of loading vehicles and cargo, and the crew of two pilots were seated in tandem in a cockpit on the top of the fuselage, which was accessed via an internal ladder and was fifteen feet above ground; they were eventually protected by a bullet-proof windscreen and a plate of armour behind the second pilot. An intercom was also added to provide communication between the pilots and the personnel below them. An initial design feature, which was eventually removed prior to full-scale production, was the installation of an under-fuselage hatch which would allow the prone firing of a Bren light machine gun as the glider approached the landing zone.|$|E
