MacDonald, and dedicated the novella [...] "Sun Dog" [...] to MacDonald, saying [...] "I miss you, old friend." [...] For his part, MacDonald wrote an admiring preface to Night Shift, and even had his famous character, Travis McGee, reading Cujo in one of the last McGee novels and Pet Sematary in the last McGee novel, The Lonely <b>Silver</b> <b>Rain.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{was a time}} {{of wonder}} and marvel, of the soft touch of <b>silver</b> <b>rain</b> on {{greening}} fields, of the incredible delicacy of young leaves, of blossom in field and garden and wood. The whole world bloomed in a flush and tremor of maiden loveliness, instinct with all the evasive, fleeting charm of spring and girlhood and young morning. We felt and enjoyed it all without understanding or analyzing it. It was enough to be glad and young with spring on the golden road.|$|E

60|$|A {{gleam of}} day {{was in the}} sky as Hamel, with Mrs. Fentolin by his side, passed along the path which led from the Tower to St. David's Hall. Lights were still burning from its windows; {{the outline of the}} {{building}} itself was faintly defined against the sky. Behind him, across the sea, was that one straight line of grey merging into <b>silver.</b> The <b>rain</b> had ceased and the wind had dropped. On either side of them stretched the brimming creeks.|$|R
60|$|What {{a horror}} brooded over that spring--that so {{beautiful}} spring! It {{was a time}} of wonder and marvel; of the soft touch of <b>silver</b> <b>rain</b> on greening fields; of the incredible delicacy of young leaves; of blossom on the land and blossom in the sunset. The whole world bloomed in a flush and tremor of maiden loveliness, instinct with all the evasive, fleeting charm of spring and girlhood and young morning. And almost every night of this wonderful time the dream-child called his mother, and we roved the gray shore in quest of him.|$|E

60|$|The Count's pile {{remained}} untouched, and {{a bright}} flush suffused his hitherto pale cheeks while the <b>silver</b> <b>rain</b> was falling on his square, but {{to the surprise of}} Lewis, he did not rake it towards him as did the others. He left the increased amount on exactly the same spot, merely drawing it gently together with his rake. As he did so the knotted haggard look returned to his once again bloodless brow and face. Not less precise and silent were his companions. The board again spun round; the inexorable pea fell; the raking and raining were repeated, and again the Count's stake lay glittering before him. His eyes glittered even more brightly than the silver. Lewis concluded that he must have been brought down to desperate poverty, and meant to recover himself by desperate means, for he left the whole stake again on the same spot.|$|E
6000|$|The {{decision}} of the pea--if we may so express it--was quietly stated, and to an ignorant spectator {{it seemed as if}} the guardians of the table raked all the stakes into their own maws. But here and there, like white rocks in a dark sea, several little piles were left untouched. To the owners of these a number of silver pieces were tossed--tossed so deftly that we might almost say it <b>rained</b> <b>silver</b> on those regions of the table. No wizard of legerdemain ever equalled the sleight of hand with which these men pitched, reckoned, manipulated, and raked in silver pieces! ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the song}} progresses, {{more and more}} members of the {{audience}} get up and dance to the music and <b>silver</b> foil confetti <b>rains</b> from the ceiling. Among the cutaways to the audience, a young woman is seen happily dancing on her own, a male couple kiss and a topless DJ wearing sunglasses - who commentators have noted bears some resemblance to Russian President Vladimir Putin [...] - is also dancing along to the music. Throughout, the lyrics of the song appear as Karaoke-style subtitles. The video ends with the music fading out and a closing slide wishing [...] "GOOD LUCK TO EVERYONE OUT IN SOCHI." [...] It finally cuts to a station ident that features the Channel 4 logo, a super-imposed, revolving, rainbow-coloured prism and the caption: [...] "BORN RISKY".|$|R
50|$|The {{town had}} {{originally}} been designed with the streets running north to south. The town was also built {{in the path of}} normal water runoff. Businesses sprang up, and people learned to deal with the inconveniences of the summer <b>rain.</b> <b>Silver</b> City was built with high sidewalks in the downtown area to accommodate high flood waters. Meanwhile, uncontrolled cattle grazing thinned down plant life on hills surrounding the town, as did deforestation. During the night of July 21, 1895, a heavy wall of water rushed through the downtown business district, leaving a trail of destruction. A ditch 55 ft lower than the original street level was created in what was once known as Main Street. Businesses on Main Street began using their back doors on Bullard Street as main entrances and eventually, were permanently used as the new front entrances. To this day, the incorrect odd/even addressing conventions {{on the east side of}} Bullard Street are a reminder that the buildings were addressed on Main Street originally, not Bullard Street. Main Street now ends near the back of the Silver City Police Station, where the Big Ditch Park begins.|$|R
60|$|Our {{summer was}} over. It {{had been a}} {{beautiful}} one. We had known the sweetness of common joys, the delight of dawns, the dream and glamour of noontides, the long, purple peace of carefree nights. We had {{had the pleasure of}} bird song, of <b>silver</b> <b>rain</b> on greening fields, of storm among the trees, of blossoming meadows, and of the converse of whispering leaves. We had had brotherhood with wind and star, with books and tales, and hearth fires of autumn. Ours had been the little, loving tasks of every day, blithe companionship, shared thoughts, and adventuring. Rich were we in the memory of those opulent months that had gone from us--richer than we then knew or suspected. And before us was the dream of spring. It is always safe to dream of spring. For it is sure to come; and if it be not just as we have pictured it, it will be infinitely sweeter.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is our teacher. Morning {{and evening}} {{throughout}} the various world, in {{the procession of}} the seasons, and in the blue heavens powdered with stars; in mountain and plain and many-toned forest; in the sounding walls of the ocean, and in the billowy seas through which we pass in peril from land to land, we read his thoughts and listen to his voice. Here do we learn with what far-seeing intelligence he has laid the foundations of his everlasting mansion, how skillfully he has builded its walls, and with what prodigal richness he has decorated all his works. For the sunlight and moonlight and the blueness of heaven are his; the sea with its tides; the blackness and the lightnings of the tempest, and snow, and changeful winds, and green and yellow leaf; his are also the <b>silver</b> <b>rain</b> and the rainbow, the shadows and the many-colored mists, which he flings like a mantle over all the world. Herein do we learn that he loves a stable building, and that the foundations and walls shall endure for ever: yet loves not sameness; thus, {{from day to day}} and from season to season do all things change their aspect, and the walls and floor and roof of his dwelling are covered with a new glory. But to us it is not given to rise to this supreme majesty in our works; therefore do we, like him yet unable to reach so great a height, borrow nothing one from the other, but in each house learn separately from him alone who has infinite riches; so that every habitation, changeless and eternal in itself, shall yet differ from all others, having its own special beauty and splendor: for we inhabit one house only, but the Father of men inhabits all.|$|E

60|$|Towards evening, as {{the stream}} narrowed, the {{spectacle}} was imposing. The avenues and trees stood up like walls, but living walls; and in places their billowy bulges {{seemed about to}} burst upon us like Cape-rollers. Every contrast was there of light and dark, short and tall, thick and thin; of age and death with lusty youth clinging around it; of the cocoa's drooping frond and the aspiring arm of bombax, the silk-cotton-tree, which rains brown gossamer when the wind blows; of the sloth-tree with its topping tuft, and the tangled mantle of the calamus or rattan, a palm like a bamboo-cane. The bristly pod of the dolichos (pruriens) hangs {{by the side of}} the leguminos√¶, from whose flattened, chestnut-coloured seeds snuff-boxes are made further east. It was also a floresta florida, whose giants are decked with the tender little blossoms of the shrub, and where the bright bracts and yellow greens of this year's growth light up the sombre verdure of an older date. The type of this growth is the red camwood-tree, with its white flower of the sweetest savour. Imagine an English elm studded with pinks or daisies, gardenias or hyacinths. There is nothing more picturesque than the shiftings and changes of aspect upon these African streams, which at first seem so monotonous. After dawn the smoking water, feeling tepid to the hand and warmer than the atmosphere, veils the lower levels and makes the forest look as if based on air. Noon brings out every variety of distance with startling distinctness, and night, especially moonlit night, blurs with its mists long tracts of forest, <b>rains</b> <b>silver</b> over the ridges, and leaves the hollows in the blackest shade. Seen from above, the sea of trees looks like green water raised to waves by the wind, and the rustling in the breeze mimics the sound of distant surf.|$|R

With Increasing development of nanotechnology, concerns associated with release of materials containing nanoparticles into the environment is rising. The {{purpose of this study}} is investigation of salinity effect on the acute toxicity of silver nanoparticles in rainbow trout fry (Oncorhynchusmykiss). Materials and Methods: In order to conduct the toxicity tests, the Caspian Seawater(12 &plusmn; 0. 2 ppt) and (0. 4 ppt) as sources of brackish water and freshwater were used, respectively. Toxicity of silvernano particles were evaluated in brackish water and freshwater at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 ppm and&nbsp; 0. 12, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 ppm, respectively. In addition, in order to investigate the quality of the used silver nanoparticles the Zetasizer, ICP, and TEM method were applied. Results: Results of 96 -hour median lethal concentration(LC 50 96 h), showed that toxicity of <b>silver</b> nanoparticles for <b>rain</b> bow trout fry in brackish water is 12 times less than its toxicity in freshwater. Conclusion: According to the toxicity categories, analysis of the results showed that, for rainbow trout fry (1 g), silver nanoparticles are classified as highly toxic agent substances in fresh water, and little toxic in brackish water, respectively. /* Style Definitions */ table.
