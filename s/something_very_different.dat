5|$|The {{preservation}} of these fossils {{is one of}} their great fascinations to science. As soft-bodied organisms, they would normally not fossilize and, unlike later soft-bodied fossil biota such as the Burgess Shale or Solnhofen Limestone, the Ediacaran biota is not found in a restricted environment subject to unusual local conditions: they were a global phenomenon. The processes that were operating must have been systemic and worldwide. There was <b>something</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> about the Ediacaran Period that permitted these delicate creatures to be left behind and it is thought the fossils were preserved by virtue of rapid covering by ash or sand, trapping them against the mud or microbial mats on which they lived. Their preservation was possibly enhanced by the high concentration of silica in the oceans before silica-secreting organisms such as sponges and diatoms became prevalent. Ash beds provide more detail and can readily be dated to the nearest million years or better using radiometric dating.|$|E

40|$|Part of the {{exhibition}} 'Out of Nowhere' curated by John Wynne and Michael Madsen, June 1997. Michael initiated Lydd/Galleri, a gallery working with sound and music based around {{the construction of a}} system of 25 loudspeakers built into the paving of a section of the enormous city square near the City Hall. The speaker system is driven from a small studio space underneath the square. Each individual speaker is under the control of an automated routing system from a control and routing system in the studio. For 'Open Square' a microphone was positioned about 150 m away from the speaker grid and the amplified sound of the square was fed to the speakers in real time. This gentle amplification was programmed to fade in and out in irregular intervals, one moment it would be there, another not. This situation allows an awareness for the casual visitor that <b>something</b> is <b>very</b> <b>different</b> acoustically. Often a minimal and subtle presence, the results could be at times startling - a loud bus starting up near the microphone position - the City Hall clock chimes with an audible and distinct delay - a sudden invasion of invisible pigeons...|$|R
40|$|US {{economist}} Hyman Minsky jokingly used {{to claim}} that {{there are as many}} varieties of capitalism as Heinz has pickles, that is 57 varieties (Minsky 1991). In this paper we argue that economic integration provides a similar analytical problem: economic integration can take many forms, and some are more conducive to wealth and freedom than others. Colonialism was probably the first form of international economic integration, and a very close form of integration at that. Intuitively we understand that what the European Union has attempted to achieve – ever since Winston Churchill called for ‘a kind of United States of Europe’ in a 1946 Zurich University speech – is <b>something</b> qualitatively <b>very</b> <b>different</b> from colonialism. In this paper we argue that European economic integration has made a qualitative shift from one type of economic integration to another, from a Listian symmetrical economic integration to an integrative and asymmetrical integration. We argue that this change – originating in a new definition of the nature of capitalism – is measurably threatening European welfare, first in the economic periphery and secondly potentially also in the core countries. ...|$|R

[...] Because Disney could not afford to hire a [...] "big singer", they drafted Canadian singer Celine Dion, who was relatively new to the music industry at the time, to record [...] "Beauty and the Beast".

2500|$|Bernini's first work at St. Peter's was {{to design}} the baldacchino, a pavilion-like {{structure}} [...] tall and {{claimed to be the}} largest piece of bronze in the world, which stands beneath the dome and above the altar. Its design is based on the ciborium, of which there are many in the churches of Rome, serving to create a sort of holy space above and around the table on which the Sacrament is laid for the Eucharist and emphasizing the significance of this ritual. These ciboria are generally of white marble, with inlaid coloured stone. Bernini's concept was for <b>something</b> <b>very</b> <b>different.</b> He took his inspiration in part from the baldachin or canopy carried above the head of the pope in processions, and in part from eight ancient columns that had formed part of a screen in the old basilica. Their twisted barley-sugar shape had a special significance as they were modeled on those of the Temple of Jerusalem and donated by the Emperor Constantine. Based on these columns, Bernini created four huge columns of bronze, twisted and decorated with laurel leaves and bees, which were the emblem of Pope Urban.|$|E
2500|$|Producer Deeley, on {{the other}} hand, was quick to defend Cimino's {{comments}} on the nature and motives of the film: [...] "The Deer Hunter wasn't really 'about' Vietnam. It was <b>something</b> <b>very</b> <b>different.</b> It wasn't about drugs or {{the collapse of the}} morale of the soldiers. It was about how individuals respond to pressure: different men reacting quite differently. The film was about three steel workers in extraordinary circumstances. Apocalypse Now is surreal. The Deer Hunter is a parable... Men who fight and lose an unworthy war face some obvious and unpalatable choices. They can blame their leaders.. or they can blame themselves. Self-blame has been a great burden for many war veterans. So how does a soldier come to terms with his defeat and yet still retain his self-respect? One way is to present the conquering enemy as so inhuman, and the battle between the good guys (us) and the bad guys (them) so uneven, as to render defeat irrelevant. Inhumanity was the theme of The Deer Hunter's portrayal of the North Vietnamese prison guards forcing American POWs to play Russian roulette. The audience's sympathy with prisoners who (quite understandably) cracked thus completes the chain. Accordingly, some veterans who suffered in that war found the Russian roulette a valid allegory." ...|$|E
