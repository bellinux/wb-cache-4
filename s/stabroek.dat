In 1812, the British merged Demerara and Essequibo into the colony of Demerara-Essequibo. The colonies were ceded to Britain by treaty between the Netherlands and Britain on 13 August 1814. <b>Stabroek,</b> as the colony's capital was known under the Dutch, was renamed as Georgetown in 1812.

60|$|Parma {{was well}} aware of the supreme {{importance}} of this dyke. He had fringed both its margins with breastworks of stakes, and had strengthened the whole body of the dyke with timber work and piles. Where it touched the great Scheldt dyke a strong fortress called the Holy Cross had been constructed under the command of Mondragon, and at the further end, in the neighbourhood of Mansfeldt's headquarters, was another fort called the <b>Stabroek,</b> which commanded and raked the whole dyke.|$|E
60|$|For {{three hours}} the {{party on the}} dyke {{remained}} unmolested. Parma was at his camp four leagues away, and in ignorance {{of what had been}} done, and Mansfeldt could send no word across to him. The latter held a council of war, but it seemed that nothing could be done. Three thousand men were entrenched on the narrow dyke, covered by the guns of a hundred and sixty Zeeland ships. Some of the officers were in favour of waiting until nightfall; but at last the advice of a gallant officer, Camillo Capizucca, colonel of the Italian Legion, carried the day in favour of an immediate assault, and the Italians and Spaniards marched together from Fort <b>Stabroek</b> to the Palisade Fort, which was now in extremity.|$|E
60|$|Seeing the uselessness of the siege, {{the attempt}} to capture Lillo was abandoned, having cost the Spaniards no less than two {{thousand}} lives. Parma's own camp was {{on the opposite side}} of the river, at the villages of Beveren, Kalloo, and Borght, and he was thus nearly opposite to Antwerp, as the river swept round with a sharp curve. He had with him half his army, while the rest were at <b>Stabroek</b> {{on the opposite side of}} the river, nearly ten miles below Antwerp. Kallo stood upon rising ground, and was speedily transformed into a bustling town. From this point an army of men dug a canal to Steeken, a place on the river above Antwerp twelve miles from Kalloo, and as soon as Ghent and Dendermonde had fallen, great rafts of timber, fleets of boats laden with provisions, munitions, building materials, and every other requisite for the great undertaking Parma had in view were brought to Kalloo.|$|E
