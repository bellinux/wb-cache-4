Brady and effluent operative Don Palmer from the council sewage department go to investigate.They find the drain blocked and slime trails but when they examine the sewer they find nothing wrong. They do not see two slugs hidden in the darkness.Carol Wilton leaves her four-year-old son Paul in the garden to buy some bread and milk, while he sits and watches slugs eat his rabbit.Harold Morris, keen gardener, puts on a garden glove that has slugs in some of the fingers. They eat most of his hand by the time Harold, assisted by his wife Jean manage to cut it off with shears and a trowel.Mike Brady and his wife Kim are doing some gardening when Brady is attacked by slugs who try to bite his hand. He manages to put three of the slugs into a jar.Mike and Kim take the captured slugs to Merton Museum for advice. Museum curator John Foley examines the slugs but tells them he is no expert. Brady asks Foley if he thinks slugs could kill a man. He puts a pond snail in a tray with a slug and the slug immediately eats the snail.Brady goes to a garden centre and buys a bottle of <b>slug</b> <b>poison</b> and some slug pellets. He puts them down in his garden.Kath Green leaves her two-year-old daughter Amanda playing with her dolls in her conservatory to buy the little girl an ice cream. In her mother's absence, Amanda finds a slime trail, puts her hand in it and licks it off. Later that night, Kath rushes into Amanda's bedroom to find her convulsing on the bed. In a wild frenzy, Amanda bites her Mum's neck who then falls downstairs bleeding to death. Ray Green returns home from work to find both his wife and daughter dead.Brady goes to see if the poison has done its job, but although some of the pellets have gone, the slugs are still there.Computer firm rep David Watson and his wife Maureen sit down to Sunday lunch. David eats half a slug which was hidden in some lettuce. He goes to bed that night with a terrible stomach ache and awakes with a very bad headache.At a business lunch that day in the City Hotel, David Watson tries to secure a new contract with Edward Canning and Kenneth Riggs. David is overcome by a terrible headache until finally blood gushes from one of his nostrils and a long white worm slithers out of it. David falls onto a table dying as another slug bursts out of one of his eyes. A waiter from the restaurant calls the local Health Inspector.Brady investigates the sickening scene and finds the worms lying dead next to Watson's body. He takes them to the museum for Foley to look at. Foley tells Brady that he has been reading up on the slugs and after dissecting and doing tests, he says that they are a hybrid of the ordinary garden variety. The white worms are [...] "schistosomes", a parasite found in the blood stream of slugs. If ingested by humans they cause the often fatal disease Schistomiasis. Foley tells Brady that he will start work on making a poison.Clive Talbot, 18, and Donna Moss, 17, are having sex in Donna's parents' bedroom while they are out. Slugs make their way through the garden, into the drain, up the drain pipe, along the guttering, down onto a window sill and drop onto the floor of the bedroom. Donna is killed first as the slugs crawl inside her. Clive, also being eaten alive jumps from the bedroom window straight onto a cold frame below and is killed by a shard of glass.Brady returns home and tells Kim about the days events at the City Hotel. He explains what Foley told him, adding that he thinks slugs killed Ron Bell. Kim goes into the kitchen to find six slugs which have crawled out of a tap. Brady kills them all but realises the slugs are in the water supply and will be all over Merton.Gravedigger Charlie Barnes digs up a grave during the night to rob the occupants valuables, but is eaten alive by slugs when he falls in.Brady calls his G.P. Dr. Warwick at his surgery to see if he has had any unusual cases. The doctor tells him he has had nine complaints so far of nausea, headaches, sensitivity to light, diarrhoea, fever and vomiting. Brady explains that he thinks the water is contaminated, and Warwick says that there is a species of snail that spreads a disease called Bilharzia, but that disease is confined to Africa and Asia. Brady goes to see Merton's Water Board Inspector Frank Phillips and explains to him what has happened, asking him to turn the water supply off. Phillips laughs and refuses. Brady spots an article in a local newspaper saying that police are baffled about three mysterious deaths. He returns to his office to find that Foley has left a message with Julie.Brady goes to see Foley at the museum. He has developed a liquid that kills slugs on contact. However, it explodes when it touches moisture so they talk to Don Palmer about how to get it into the sewer system. The plan is for Brady and Palmer to go down into the sewer by Ron Bell's house and act as bait, luring the slugs into a central chamber, while Foley waits above ground and releases the poison.Brady and Palmer climb into Ron Bell's house through a broken window and go down into the cellar where they find hundreds of slugs on the floor. They empty a can of petrol into the cellar, ignite it then leave the house. Equipped with overalls, masks, oxygen tanks and two-way radios, Brady and Palmer and go down into the sewer via a manhole cover outside the house.Brady and Palmer test their radios, then begin searching the central chambers of the sewers for the slugs' nest. Foley follows them in above his car. They find the slugs, but become trapped when they cannot remove a grille from a chamber. Brady eventually removes the grille but Palmer is eaten by the slugs in the meantime. Foley drives to the manhole cover where Brady can escape but the cover is jammed shut. Using a rope tied to his car he manages to remove the manhole cover, just before Brady's oxygen supply runs out. Both men tip the 5 gallon drum of poison down into the sewer which sets off a chain reaction sweeping through the entire Merton sewer system.Farmer George Thomas from Merton, drives to London's Covent Garden to deliver some vegetables to a buyer. The buyer searches through the vegetables, throwing the rotten ones into a pile. In amongst some rotten lettuces are some slugs' eggs...|$|E
2500|$|It {{deals with}} Louis Steig, whose mother is dying of cancer. He rushes to her side, but his car crashes on some black ice. He suffers some {{damage to his}} vision and brain. While visiting his mother, he discovers a {{creature}} {{no one else can}} see, which he calls [...] "cancer vampires", infesting his mother with [...] "tumor-slugs". At her funeral, many of these vampires visit to feed on the now corpulent and grown slugs infesting her body. Eventually after both his sister and his fiancee contract cancer, Louis discovers that he can kill cancer vampires by taking radioactive isotopes into his body; these isotopes act as a beacon to the <b>slugs,</b> who are <b>poisoned</b> when they flock to it. In turn, these <b>slugs</b> <b>poison</b> the vampires who eat them when the vampires themselves flock to Louis.|$|R
40|$|PhDStudies on Deroceras reticulatum (MÃ¼ller), {{the grey}} field slug, {{indicate}} that this animal is responsive to food odours and can therefore. select its food. Olfactory responses to food odours are monitored by distance chemoreceptors while contact chemoreception {{is responsible for the}} gustatory stimuli associated with taste. Both types of sensory perception are important in the feeding cycle. The former has been investigated {{with the aid of a}} timelapse camera and the behaviour of slugs monitored in the presence of various food materials and their components. Gustatory responses have been assessed by a feeding assay which permits the quantitive analysis of food ingested. These two aspects of feeding behaviour have been combined to provide a framework for the improved formulation of slug baits for use in agriculture. The two molluscicides metaldehyde and methiocarb have been compared in laboratory and field tests for their efficiency in <b>poisoning</b> <b>slugs</b> and their effects on soil fauna. The field results, which included comparisons between laboratory and commercial metaldehyde formulations, indicate the importance of monitoring the residual population of slugs which remains after baiting. It appears that the true level of bait efficiency may be obscured if tests are concerned only with recording the number of poisoned animals trapped. The addition of a mammal repellent to slug baits does not appear to adversely affect their attraction to slugs but individual formulations may vary considerably in both their palatability and their effectiveness. The laboratory feeding tests have suggested that Derbceras reticulatum habituates to certain diets and that the feeding response may decline over a few days - this can be restored by presenting a novel food to the animals. The meal size of this species can be manipulated in the laboratory by altering the diet'and by the addition of attractive components. Some attempt has been made to define these compounds with a view to improving the consumption of baits by slugs in the field...|$|R
