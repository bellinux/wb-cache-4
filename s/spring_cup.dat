25|$|A {{comeback}} was attempted in February 1931, {{again at}} Wimbledon, however Mick suffered a torn dewclaw in a trial, setting back his return until March {{when he won}} the <b>Spring</b> <b>Cup</b> again at Wembley breaking the track record in the final before he returned to White City with the aim of winning a third Derby.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Buckland {{joined the}} Vancouver Whitecaps FC Prospects Program. Two years later, she was {{competing}} with the club's Pacific Coast Soccer League (PCSL) side and scored 11 goals, despite missing {{a third of the}} campaign. The Whitecaps advanced to the semifinals of the PCSL Challenge Cup playoffs, where they were defeated 4–2 by the Tri-Cities Xtreme. Aside from league play, Buckland competed in the Keg <b>Spring</b> <b>Cup</b> and the San Diego Surf Cup with the Whitecaps Prospects. At the first tournament, held in Victoria, British Columbia, in March 2008, she scored game-winning goals in the semifinal against the University of British Columbia Thunderbirds and final against the University of Victoria Vikes to help capture the championship. Several months later, in August, she recorded five goals in as many games at the latter tournament, a U19 competition against youth teams from the United States. Helping Vancouver to the semifinals, they lost 3–1 to Northern California state champions Mustang FC.|$|E
25|$|He {{reached the}} Easter Cup final at Shelbourne {{and won the}} <b>Spring</b> <b>Cup</b> final at Harold's Cross Stadium and National Cup final at Shelbourne before {{travelling}} to England for the first time. In a solo trial prior to the 1929 English Greyhound Derby on 25 July, Mick broke the track record, reducing his odds from an initial 25–1 to becoming the 4–7 favorite to win {{by the time of}} the final, despite still being new off the board from Ireland. He was housed at the kennels of Paddy McEllistrim for the duration of the Derby. In the first round, Mick pulled away down the back straight, beating Captured Half by eight lengths and setting a time of 29.82, a new world record over that length. Father Browne sold Mick for £800, plus any prize money that the dog would win on the night, which at the time was more than the cost of buying a house in nearby Shepherd's Bush. By 8:45pm, when the final took place, some 40,000 spectators were in the ground. The lineup was four dogs; in trap one was Beadsman at 20–1; trap two was Palatinus at 3–1; trap three was Entomb at 9–2, and finally Mick the Miller in trap four, wearing the black jacket. Palatinus made the best start, at the first bend both Mick and Entomb attempted to move inside to the rail, but Beadsman collided with both of them, sending all three dogs sprawling. The no–race klaxon went off, and the race had to be restarted. None of the dogs was allowed to leave the track with until the race was re–run at 9:15pm, the only comfort given to Mick on a particularly hot summer's evening was a handkerchief soaked in cold water.|$|E

Airdrie reached the Texaco Cup Final in 1972, losing 2–1 on aggregate to Derby County. They also reached the 1975 Scottish Cup Final, losing 3–1 to Celtic.
