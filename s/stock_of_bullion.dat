40|$|Can {{the central}} bank of a small open economy be {{mandated}} with the maintenance of both fixed exchange rates and monetary independence, and still succeed in the long term? Looking at a pioneering experiment put {{in place by the}} National Bank of Belgium, this article shows how foreign exchange policy allowed for persistent violations of the predictions of the trilemma in the 1850 s. Success was based on four main ingredients. First, the credibility of the peg was not built through the stabilisation of exchange rates, but through the stabilisation of central bank liquidity (i. e. the ‘margin of manoeuvre’ available for countercyclical action) : based on constructive ambiguity, this strategy positively influenced market expectations. Second, the <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>bullion</b> circulating in the country acted as a buffer for central bank reserves. Third, the banking system had a structural liquidity deficit towards {{the central bank}}. Fourth, the central bank was big enough to meet the domestic demand of credit and accumulate foreign reserves at the same time. These findings shed new light on the nature of monetary policy and its implementation in the 19 th century. Foreign exchange policy, monetary policy implementation, reserve management...|$|E
5000|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, {{banknotes}} were handwritten or part-printed {{and could}} be exchanged, {{in whole or in}} part, for an equivalent amount of gold when presented at the bank. During the First World War the British Government wanted to maintain its <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>bullion</b> and so banks were ordered stop exchanging banknotes for gold. One pound and 10 shillings notes were introduced by the Treasury in lieu of gold sovereigns. These notes were nicknamed [...] "Bradburys" [...] because of the prominent signature of Sir John Bradbury, Permanent Secretary to the Treasury displayed on the notes. Britain returned to the gold standard in 1925, although the Bank of England was only obliged to exchange notes for gold in multiples of 400 ounces or more. The responsibility for the printing of ten-shilling notes was transferred to the Bank of England in 1928, and the ability to redeem banknotes for gold ceased in 1931 when Britain stopped using the gold standard.|$|R
5000|$|Chadbourne {{argued for}} the {{creation}} of a “silver reserve system” wherein all countries would agree to hold a reserve <b>stock</b> (a <b>bullion)</b> <b>of</b> silver, and to produce coinage using a consistent portion of silver. [...] The plan was conceived in response to silver devaluation, which Chadbourne attributed to countries “dumping” large amounts of silver on the world market, by reducing the amount of silver they used in coins. Chadbourne estimated that half the world's population held its wealth in silver. Those individuals saw their wealth steadily eroded with the growing worldwide silver surplus. The proposed system would work much in the same way as the Federal Reserve uses monetary policy. To stem inflation, Chadbourne asserted, nations could release <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> silver into the market from their reserves. The concept differs from Federal Reserve tools primarily in that a “bullion” is a stock measured in volume, rather than monetary value. Chadbourne hoped to change the trend whereby silver had become a commodity rather than a store of value.|$|R

50|$|The {{terms of}} deposit were such that {{deposits}} <b>of</b> <b>bullion</b> were most commonly made {{when the price}} was somewhat lower than ordinary, and taken out again when it rose. The proportions between the bank price (the credit which the bank gave for deposits <b>of</b> <b>bullion),</b> the mint price, and the market price <b>of</b> gold <b>bullion</b> were always nearly the same. A person could generally sell his receipt for {{the difference between the}} mint price <b>of</b> <b>bullion</b> and the market price. As a receipt was nearly always worth something, it was only rarely that deposits were allowed to fall to the bank through the expiration of receipts (which means the depositor neither paid additional keeping fees nor removed his deposit from the bank). This happened more frequently with regard to gold, due to its higher keeping fee.|$|R

50|$|When {{a holder}} of a receipt {{found himself in}} need of coinage, he could sell his receipt.

The holder of a receipt, when he purchased bank money, purchased the power of taking out a quantity <b>of</b> <b>bullion,</b> <b>of</b> which the mint price is five per cent above the bank price. The agio of five per cent therefore, which he commonly paid for it, was paid not for an imaginary but for a real value. The owner of bank money, when he purchased a receipt, purchased the power of taking out a quantity <b>of</b> <b>bullion</b> <b>of</b> which the market price is commonly from two to three per cent above the mint price.
