2500|$|While {{there are}} several {{mentions}} in literary works of Sanskrit and Greek, the primary literary sources giving detailed accounts of the early Chera Kings are the anthologies of Sangam literature, created between [...] 1st and the 4th centuries CE. They are rich in descriptions {{about a number of}} Chera kings and princes, along with the poets who extolled them. However, these are not worked into connected history and settled chronology so far. A chronological device, known as Gajabahu synchronism, is used by historians to help date early Tamil history. Despite its dependency on numerous conjectures, Gajabahu synchronism has wide acceptance among modern scholars and is considered as the <b>sheet</b> <b>anchor</b> for the purpose of dating ancient Tamil literature. The method depends on an event depicted in Silappatikaram, which describes the visit of Kayavaku, the king of Ilankai (Sri Lanka), in the Chera kingdom during the reign of the Chera king, Senguttuvan. The Gajabahu method considers this Kayavaku as Gajabahu, who according Mahavamsa, a historical poem written in Pali language on the kings of Sri Lanka, lived {{in the latter half of}} the 2nd century CE. This, in turn, has been used to fix the period Senguttuvan, who ruled his kingdom for 55 years (according to the Pathitrupathu), in the 2nd century CE.|$|E
40|$|A large {{inventory}} of low rise masonry buildings in Canada {{and elsewhere in}} the world were built using unreinforced or partially reinforced load bearing wall. The majority of existing masonry structures is deficient in resisting seismic force demands specified in current building codes. Therefore, they pose significant risk to life safety and economic wellbeing of any major metropolitan centre. Because it is not economically feasible to replace the existing substandard buildings with new and improved structures, seismic retrofitting remains to be an economically viable option. The effectiveness of surface bonded carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets in retrofitting low-rise load bearing masonry walls was investigated in the current research project. The retrofit technique included the enhancements in wall capacity in shear and flexure, as well as anchoring the walls to the supporting elements through appropriate anchorage systems. Both FRP fan type <b>anchors</b> and steel <b>sheet</b> <b>anchors</b> were investigated for elastic and inelastic wall response. One partially reinforced masonry (PRM) wall and one unreinforced masonry (URM) wall were built, instrumented and tested under simulated seismic loading to develop the retrofit technique. The walls were retrofitted with CFRP sheets applied only on one side to represent a frequently encountered constraint in practice. FRP fan anchors and stainless steel <b>sheet</b> <b>anchors</b> were used to connect the vertical FRP sheets to the wall foundation. The walls were tested under constant gravity load and incrementally increasing in-plane deformation reversals. The lateral load capacities of both walls were enhanced significantly. The steel <b>sheet</b> <b>anchors</b> also resulted in some ductility. In addition, some small-scale tests were performed to select appropriate anchor materials. It was concluded that ductile stainless steel <b>sheet</b> <b>anchors</b> would be the best option for brittle URM walls. Analytical research was conducted to assess the applicability of truss analogy to retrofitted walls. An analytical model was developed and load displacement relationships were generated for the two walls that were retrofitted. The analytical results were compared with those obtained experimentally, indicating good agreement in force resistance for use as a design tool...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades the use of {{externally}} bonded fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) materials for structural strengthening applications has become an accepted and widely used method. A primary concern of FRP structural strengthening systems is that the FRP often debonds from the concrete well before the load capacity of the FRP material is reached. In addition, debonding failures are often brittle and occur with little warning. Past research concluded that fastening FRP <b>sheets</b> with FRP <b>anchors</b> is an effective method for delaying or preventing debonding failures. However, there is a clear lack of research pertaining to fastening FRP <b>sheets</b> with FRP <b>anchors,</b> and a corresponding lack of design guidance. The primary objective of this research program was to better understand the behavior of bonded FRP sheets that are secured with FRP anchors to aid in future development of design recommendations of this anchorage system. This thesis deals with carbon fiber unidirectional sheets applied using the wet layup system. Design parameters that were investigated include: manufacturer of the FRP materials, unanchored and <b>anchored</b> <b>sheets,</b> number of <b>anchor</b> rows and spacing between rows, number of sheet plies (single or double), and length of bonded <b>sheet</b> behind the <b>anchors.</b> A total of sixteen specimens were tested. Experimental results show that FRP anchorage systems are very effective in increasing load capacity by delaying debonding. Finite element models were also developed of anchored and unanchored bonded FRP sheets...|$|R

The anchor shaft was inserted into holes predrilled into the concrete, and the shaft region protruded from the concrete surface prior to wetting of the FRP <b>sheet.</b> All <b>anchors</b> had a 51  mm length to avoid interference with the reinforcement in the concrete blocks. This length is shorter than what is normally recommended for anchorage to concrete but did not seem to negatively affect the performance of the system as only a few anchor pullouts were observed. The hole in the concrete was partially filled prior to anchor insertion and filled to the top border after the anchor was inserted. The splay region was saturated {{at the same time as}} the FRP sheet was applied to the surface of the concrete.|$|R
40|$|Conventional seismic {{designs of}} quay walls in ports are mostly based on pseudo-static analysis.

The {{aim of this}} study is to investigate the suitability of this method for <b>anchored</b> <b>sheet</b> pile quay walls that were not purposely designed for seismic loads. A research methodology is developed in which pseudo-static, permanentdisplacement and finite element analysis are employed, calibrated with an experimental reference case that considers a typical <b>anchored</b> <b>sheet</b> pile wall.

A model to apply traditional permanent displacement analysis on <b>anchored</b> <b>sheet</b> pile walls is proposed. Dynamic analysis is successfully carried out.

The tests were designed as a first step to identify the parameters that affect the behavior of FRP sheets with supplementary FRP anchors. These tests also allowed an identification of parameters that likely contributed to differences in performance such as size of anchor (anchor diameter, anchor depth, anchor splay diameter), number of anchors, lateral and longitudinal placement of anchor, and number of FRP layers. A key aspect of these tests was to identify the potential failure modes of the FRP anchored system and techniques to avoid failure modes that resulted in undesirable performance. Adequate performance was judged on the basis of the ability of the system to develop higher force than equivalent bonded-only FRP sheets. The higher performing anchoring arrangements were those that developed a higher fraction of the rupture strength of the FRP sheets. For adequate performance, premature FRP anchor failures were to be avoided prior to rupture of the FRP sheet.|$|R

Our new model can undergo quasi-static evolution due either to changes at the boundary or to magnetic reconnection at either current sheet.

Some equilibria can be driven to catastrophic instability either through reconnection at the lower current sheet, known as tether cutting, or through reconnection at the upper current sheet, known as breakout. Other equilibria can be destabilized through only one and not the other. Still others undergo no instability, but evolve increasingly rapidly in response to slow steady driving (ideal or reconnective). One key feature of every case is a response to reconnection different from that found in simpler systems. In our two-current sheet model a reconnection electric field in one current sheet causes the current in that sheet to increase rather than decrease. This suggests the possibility for the microscopic reconnection mechanism to run away...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{beneficial}} {{effect of a}} composite material anchorage system (CMAS) upon the ductility and load capacity of reinforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened either with glass (GFRP) or carbon (CFRP) fabrics was investigated. The anchorage system consisted of U-shaped GFRP or CFRP strip (U-strip) at end of FRP. The U-strips were bonded around the beam section and further anchored by two tufts of glass fibres, each of them embedded at the opposite beam face and specifically {{in the region of}} compression zone of the beam web. Experimental evaluations in simply supported lightly re-inforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened with one GFRP or a CFRP <b>sheet</b> <b>anchored</b> at its ends by the composite an-chorage have shown that their bending capacity has increased by 8 % and 17 %, respectively, in relation to the capacity at-tained in similar RC strengthened beams without anchorage. On the other hand, their ductility was improved by an amount of 94 % and 37 %, respectively. ANSYS finite element program was also used to numerically verify the response of strengthened RC beams obtained ex-perimentally.
