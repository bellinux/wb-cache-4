5|$|At a {{drive-in}} restaurant, Vinnie and Crazy {{make out}} with their girls. When Roz spots a car that she thinks Boogaloo is in, Crazy is quick to drive off after it. Crazy ends up shooting two of the black gang members in an alley, much to Vinnie's shock. Solly investigates {{the death of the}} two black gang members. He questions Boogaloo, who tells him that he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> for the Stompers.|$|E
5|$|Scott avoided using green screens unless necessary. Instead, he used various items so {{the actors}} would {{know where they}} <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> in any {{particular}} scene on the practical sets where CGI elements would be inserted in post-production. Rapace said that green screens were used fewer than six times during filming. The production used five 3ality Technical Atom 3D rigs, four of which were configured with Red Epic 3D cameras set on camera dollies and tripods, which were continuously in use during filming. The fifth rig used an Epic camera as a steadicam, which was used only occasionally.|$|E
5|$|On 29 January 2009, it was {{revealed}} that Newcastle had agreed a £4million fee with Bolton Wanderers, which was confirmed the next day, with Nolan travelling to Tyneside to discuss terms and undergo a medical. Nolan completed his move on the same day, signing a four and a half-year contract. On 22 February, Nolan received his first red card playing for Newcastle United in a home match against Everton for a two-footed foul on Victor Anichebe. At the end of the season, Newcastle were relegated to the English Championship. Nolan was noted as one of the more vocal Newcastle players over the summer, demanding an end to the off the field distractions at the club, and suggesting the club <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> to acquire players for an immediate return to the Premier League.|$|E

25|$|Before Johnson's brigades {{could start}} their {{attack on the}} advance Union position, at Ayres's request, Warren moved a brigade from Brigadier General and Brevet Major General Samuel W. Crawford's {{division}} toward White Oak Road {{in order to secure}} Ayres's position and to disperse the Confederate pickets. At 8:15a.m., Warren advised Ayres that Sheridan had implied in correspondence to him that Merritt's force had been dislodged from White Oak Road and that Ayres <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> for an attack from the west or the north. Due to the condition of the roads and Gravelly Run, Crawford's men did not get into formation until 10:00a.m.|$|E
500|$|Soon afterwards, Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin) {{approaches}} Fox Mulder with Secare's case, {{saying he}} is of major importance to revealing the truth. When investigating the case, Mulder and Dana Scully visit Dr. Terrance Berube (Ken Kramer), a scientist working in Gaithersburg, Maryland, whose car was being driven by Secare. That night, Deep Throat meets a second time with Mulder and insists he continue, despite Mulder's uncertainty on what he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> for. That night, Berube is confronted by the [...] "Crew Cut Man" [...] (Lindsey Ginter), who kills him and makes the death look like a suicide.|$|E
500|$|... "Over There" [...] {{marks the}} first time Olivia meets Fauxlivia. Their meeting {{was one of the first}} scenes to be shot; this caused Anna Torv to be anxious about her new character's traits [...] "coming across", as she had not yet {{developed}} all her mannerisms for Fauxlivia. While filming the conversation between the two, they did not use a double; Torv memorized the timing and where she <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> and pointing her gun, and the characters were filmed one at a time. Torv commented about the scene, [...] "You're talking to air. Learning both sides... was tough." [...] For the fight scene that followed, Torv had to block and aim her gun carefully while being mindful of her movements and the camera's location—though she was aided by stunt doubles. Torv credits the crew for successfully completing the scene: [...] "I give them all the credit in the world. It took a while. They had to change the makeup, change the clothes, change the hair, change every little thing, every time they [...] the camera." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{architectural}} correspondent of The Times {{wrote that}} {{the architecture of the}} college was incongruous – it was [...] "remarkable" [...] that a college with connections to modern industry <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> backwards in this way. [...] "That a college devoted to modern scientific studies should be dressed up [...] has already been the subject of puzzled comment by many foreign visitors to Oxford." [...] Writing in The Observer, Patience Gray also disliked the college's design, referring to the [...] "Cotswold dementia" [...] of the architecture, and the college's [...] "pokey windows and grotesque sugarloaf tower." [...] The chapel was described by the travel writer Jan Morris as [...] "one of the sweetest little sanctuaries in Oxford"; [...] "very simple, almost stern" [...] with a contrast between the black and white pews and the [...] "rich colour" [...] of the stained glass. However, she said that whilst Oxford colleges change in style over time as buildings are added or altered, [...] "Nuffield was a hodge-podge from the start, with a faintly Levantine tower upon a Cotswold Gothic base".|$|E
500|$|Reception of {{the race}} was mainly negative. Italian {{newspaper}} Corriere dello Sport – Stadio called it [...] "boring", while fellow Italian paper Corriere della Sera wrote of [...] "Formula One like a sleeping pill". Sky Sports described the race as [...] "mundane" [...] and [...] "soporific". Spanish newspaper Sport highlighted Max Verstappen's [...] "spectacular" [...] overtaking as bringing [...] "the only colour" [...] into the race. The Independent wrote, referring to Hamilton's desperate attempts to pass Rosberg: [...] "If {{there was ever a}} race which confirmed that Formula One <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> at ways to facilitate overtaking, this was it." [...] In the wake of his experience, Hamilton called for Formula One to adjust rules to enhance overtaking, saying: [...] "I guess for fans it's probably not too exciting to watch. Of course, it's always nice when you're at the front, as we have been for some time now - but still, being able to race is what... and also down the back, {{the rest of the field}} is probably what fans want to see. That's probably a change that would be looked positively on." [...] Sebastian Vettel agreed, calling for more grip created by the tyres to make it easier to follow a car closely.|$|E
500|$|Tyndall had {{observed}} the electoral success achieved by Jean-Marie Le Pen and the French National Front during the 1980s, {{and hoped that}} by learning from their activities he could improve the BNP's electoral prospects. He saw the issue as being one of credibility among the electorate, declaring that [...] "we <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> for ways to overcome our present image of weakness and smallness". He ignored the significant impact that had been achieved by the French NF through moderating its policies and thereby gaining greater respectability among the electorate. While Tyndall had sought to keep skinheads and football hooligans out of the BNP, he still kept a range of Holocaust deniers and convicted criminals close to him. He expressed the view that [...] "we should not be looking for ways of applying ideological cosmetic surgery to ourselves {{in order to make}} our features more appealing to our public". Conversely, in the early 1990s a 'moderniser' faction emerged in the party that favoured a more electorally palatable strategy and an emphasis on building grassroots support to win local elections. They were impressed by Le Pen's move to disassociate his party from biological racism and focus on the perceived cultural incompatibility of different racial groups. Tyndall opposed many of the modernisers' ideas and sought to stem their growing influence in the party, ...|$|E

2500|$|During her June 12, 2010, {{appearance}} on Freedom Watch, Palin elaborated on her stance {{that even though}} marijuana should not be legalized, enforcement of marijuana prohibition laws should be made a lower priority: [...] "Well, if we’re talking about pot, I’m not for the legalization of pot because I think that that would just encourage, especially, our young people {{to think that it}} was okay to go ahead and use it. And I’m not an advocate for that. However, I {{think that we need to}} prioritize our law enforcement efforts. And if somebody’s gonna smoke a joint in their house and not do anybody else any harm, then perhaps there are other things that our cops <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> at to engage in and try to clean up some of the other problems that we have in society that are appropriate for law enforcement to do and not concentrate on such a, relatively speaking, minimal problem that we have in the country." ...|$|E
2500|$|Successful guerrilla {{fighting}} {{needs the}} self-confidence and initiative {{of millions of}} free men, the support at risk and at heavy sacrifice of almost all the population, {{and a feeling of}} close comradeship and solidarity between the guerrilla troops and any regular army and air force supporting them. The Nazis cannot get these qualities at their service, in any of the occupied countries of Europe, even in Italy. We can. And therefore we should not think of guerrilla warfare only in terms of the present heroism of the Soviet Union, or a possible future resistance to invasion in this country. We should think of it also in terms of our own invasion of the Continent.
