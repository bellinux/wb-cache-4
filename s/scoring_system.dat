5|$|Carlsen {{then went}} on to finish second in the Biel Grandmaster Tournament, with 18 points, just one point behind Wang Hao using the 3–1–0 <b>scoring</b> <b>system.</b> As in the Tal Memorial earlier in 2012, Carlsen managed to finish the tournament without any losses (+4−0=6). He also {{defeated}} the winner Wang in both of their individual games. In the exhibition blitz tournament at Biel before the GM tournament, Carlsen was eliminated (+1−2=0) in the first round by Étienne Bacrot. Bacrot deprived Carlsen of a win in the classical tournament by holding him to a draw in the final round. Carlsen would have won the classical tournament on the traditional 1–½–0 <b>scoring</b> <b>system,</b> with 7/10.|$|E

5|$|American football's parent {{sport of}} rugby {{continued}} to evolve. Today, two distinct codes known as rugby union and rugby league are played throughout the world. Since the two codes split following a schism {{on how the}} sport should be managed in 1895, the history of rugby league {{and the history of}} rugby union have evolved separately. Both codes have adopted innovations parallel to the American game; the rugby union <b>scoring</b> <b>system</b> is almost identical to the American game, while rugby league uses a gridiron-style field and a six-tackle rule similar to the system of downs in American Football.|$|E
5|$|Combined (or multi-discipline) {{events are}} {{competitions}} in which athletes {{participate in a}} number of track and field events, earning points for their performance in each event, which adds to a total points score. Outdoors, the most common combined events are the men's decathlon (ten events) and the women's heptathlon (seven events). Due to stadium limitations, indoor combined events competition have a reduced number of events, resulting in the men's heptathlon and the women's pentathlon.

A second medal ceremony was held, which Pomazan did not attend in protest. She was eventually required to return her gold medal.|$|E
5|$|Since its return, {{the tournament}} has used an unusual point <b>scoring</b> <b>system.</b> As with most league competitions, three points are awarded for a win, {{one for a}} draw and zero for a loss. An {{additional}} point, however, is awarded for each goal scored. The system is designed to reward teams that adopt a more attacking style of play. Each entrant plays two matches, with the winner being the club that finishes {{at the top of}} the table. The original competition was held at De Meer, Ajax's home between 1934 and 1996. The Amsterdam Arena has played host to the event since its return.|$|E
5|$|The biggest {{challenge}} {{to the notion of}} the universality of attachment theory came from studies conducted in Japan where the concept of amae plays a prominent role in describing family relationships. Arguments revolved around the appropriateness of the use of the Strange Situation procedure where amae is practiced. Ultimately research tended to confirm the universality hypothesis of attachment theory. Most recently a 2007 study conducted in Sapporo in Japan found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main and Cassidy <b>scoring</b> <b>system</b> for attachment classification.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, {{to try to}} objectify the {{progression}} of cystic fibrosis lung disease different imaging modalities can be used, with specific advantages and disadvantages. A multitude of <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> have been proposed for radiography and CT, and recently <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> for tomosynthesis and MRI also have been presented. There are large divergences in the radiological <b>scoring</b> <b>systems.</b> Most <b>scoring</b> <b>systems,</b> however, consider bronchiectasis alone, or in combination with mucus plugging, {{to be the most}} important component of the score. Bronchiectasis, with or without mucus plugging, is thus the most significant finding when evaluating pulmonary cystic fibrosis.|$|R

5|$|A <b>scoring</b> <b>system</b> to {{evaluate}} material {{is to add}} up the piece values of the material on the board. In chess, when a pawn equals one unit, a bishop or knight is worth three, a rook five and a queen nine. These values are {{a consequence of the}} difference in mobility of the pieces. In bughouse, piece values differ because pieces in reserve essentially have the same mobility as they can be dropped on any vacant square. The pawn relatively gains importance in bughouse chess, as its very limited mobility does not handicap reserve pawns. They can for instance be dropped to block non-contact checks. Pawns can be dropped onto the seventh rank, one step away from promotion, which again adds to their importance. Long-range pieces like the queen or the rook lose relative value, due to the constantly changing pawn structure. They {{are also more likely to}} be hemmed in. A valuation system, first suggested by FICS-player Gnejs, often applied to bughouse is pawn=1, bishop=knight=rook=2 and queen=4.|$|E

On {{the first day of}} the Emirates Cup, Valencia beat Inter Milan by two goals, while Arsenal defeated Paris Saint-Germain 2–1. Valencia's loss to Paris Saint-Germain on day two meant Arsenal needed to beat Inter Milan in order to finish top of the group.

The tournament was well attended with over 110,000 filling the Emirates Stadium across the two-day tournament.|$|E
5|$|Goat Simulator is an {{open-ended}} third-person perspective {{game in which}} the player controls a goat. The player is free to explore the game's world, a suburban setting, as a goat, and jump, run, bash things, and lick objects. Licking objects attaches the goat's tongue to the object and lets the player drag the object around until they let go. At any time, the player can let the goat drop into a ragdoll model, allowing the game's physics to take over, and another control makes the game run in slow-motion. A number of environmental features allow the player to manipulate the goat into stunts such as bouncing off trampolines or launching the goat into the air through large fans. The game features a <b>scoring</b> <b>system</b> similar to skateboarding games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, whereby doing tricks or other actions earns points, while chaining such tricks together in sequence helps build a multiplier that applies to the total score of the tricks done in the sequence. Various in-game goals, such as achieving a certain height, completing flips, or destroying certain objects, are given to the player, but the player {{is not required to}} follow these instructions.|$|E
40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{functional}} outcome of patients who had undergone elbow arthroscopy, evaluating the correlation between three elbow <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> and the patients' subjective perception of satisfaction METHODS: Fourteen patients who had undergone elbow arthroscopy were retrospective reviewed to evaluate the correlation between three elbow <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> and the patients' subjective perception of satisfaction at a mean follow-up time of 24 months (range 12 - 64 months). Two independent orthopedic surgeons evaluated all patients using three elbow <b>scoring</b> <b>systems,</b> a simple satisfaction question and a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: The three <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> showed significant correlation with each other (P< 0. 05). There was no correlation between the results of the three <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> and patients' satisfaction: patients with the same level of satisfaction could perform differently at the <b>scoring</b> <b>systems.</b> CONCLUSION: Although the three <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> used to evaluate the patients showed significant correlation with each other, they failed to correlate to patients' satisfaction. In reporting the results of arthroscopic elbow procedures, emphasis should be placed on individual variables, rather than on global elbow ratings. Further studies are needed to develop a single outcome evaluation system which is reliable, valid and sensitive to changes of clinical importance, which takes into account both patients' and physicians perspective, and which is short and practical to use...|$|R
40|$|Background. Tuberculosis (TB) is {{difficult}} to diagnose in children {{due to lack of}} a gold standard, especially in resource-limited settings. <b>Scoring</b> <b>systems</b> and diagnostic criteria are often used to assist in diagnosis; however their validity, especially in areas with high HIV prevalence, remains unclear. Methods. We searched online bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE and EMBASE. We selected all studies involving <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> or diagnostic criteria used to aid in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in children and extracted data from these studies. Results. The search yielded 2261 titles, of which 40 met selection criteria. Eighteen studies used point-based <b>scoring</b> <b>systems.</b> Eighteen studies used diagnostic criteria. Validation of these <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> yielded varying sensitivities as gold standards used ranged widely. Four studies evaluated and compared multiple scoring criteria. Ten studies selected for pulmonary tuberculosis. Five studies specifically evaluated the use of <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> in HIV-positive children, generally finding the specificity to be lower. Conclusions. Though <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> and diagnostic criteria remain widely used in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in children, validation has been difficult due to lack of an established and accessible gold standard. Estimates of sensitivity and specificity vary widely, especially in populations with high HIV co-infection...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} (AP) is {{a common}} inflammatory disease which can be mild and self-limiting without complications or severe with prolonged hospitalization, high morbidity, and high mortality. Different radiological <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> to predict severity and outcome in AP have been developed since the early 1990 s. In the meantime, new insights in the pathophysiology of AP and consequently, therapeutic management of these patients have been introduced. The purpose of this review is therefore (1) to describe the current terminology and new concepts in the pathophysiology, (2) to outline the long existing and newly developed radiological <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> in prediction of severity and outcome with their respective advantages and limitations, and (3) to define the role of radiological prognostic <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> in the new environment of perception of the last decade. Risk stratification in AP requires <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> that can be calculated early {{in the course of}} disease which allows time for intervention. For that reason, <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> based on necrosis are not useful in severity prediction.

It uses the blast percentage, number of cytopaenias and bone marrow cytogenetics data to place cases of CMML into these groups. Due to the <b>scoring</b> <b>system</b> being developed for MDS, the more myeloproliferative cases of CMML (WBC >13x109) are excluded from the <b>scoring</b> <b>system.</b> Although the IPSS <b>scoring</b> <b>system</b> is used clinically, there is a high variability in each group.
