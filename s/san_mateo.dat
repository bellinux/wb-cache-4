5|$|In 1529 the Chuj city of <b>San</b> <b>Mateo</b> Ixtatán (then {{known by}} the name of Ystapalapán) was given in encomienda to the conquistador Gonzalo de Ovalle {{together}} with Santa Eulalia and Jacaltenango. In 1549, the first reduction of <b>San</b> <b>Mateo</b> Ixtatán took place, overseen by Dominican missionaries, in the same year the Q'anjob'al reducción settlement of Santa Eulalia was founded. Further Q'anjob'al reducciones were in place by 1560. Q'anjob'al resistance was largely passive, based on withdrawal to the inaccessible mountains and forests. In 1586 the Mercedarian Order built the first church in Santa Eulalia. The Chuj of <b>San</b> <b>Mateo</b> Ixtatán remained rebellious and resisted Spanish control for longer than their highland neighbours, resistance that was possible owing to their alliance with the lowland Lakandon Ch'ol to the north.|$|E
5|$|On 29 January 1686, Captain Melchor Rodríguez Mazariegos, acting {{under orders}} from the governor, left Huehuetenango for <b>San</b> <b>Mateo</b> Ixtatán, where he {{recruited}} indigenous warriors from the nearby villages, 61 from <b>San</b> <b>Mateo</b> itself. It was believed by the Spanish colonial authorities that the inhabitants of <b>San</b> <b>Mateo</b> Ixtatán were friendly towards the still unconquered and fiercely hostile inhabitants of the Lacandon region, which included parts {{of what is now}} the Mexican state of Chiapas and {{the western part of the}} Petén Basin. To prevent news of the Spanish advance reaching the inhabitants of the Lacandon area, the governor ordered the capture of three of San Mateo's community leaders, named as Cristóbal Domingo, Alonso Delgado and Gaspar Jorge, and had them sent under guard to be imprisoned in Huehuetenango. The governor himself arrived in <b>San</b> <b>Mateo</b> Ixtatán on 3 February, where Captain Rodríguez Mazariegos was already awaiting him. The governor ordered the captain to remain in the village and use it as a base of operations for penetrating the Lacandon region. The Spanish missionaries Fray de Rivas and Fray Pedro de la Concepción also remained in the town. Governor Enriquez de Guzmán subsequently left <b>San</b> <b>Mateo</b> Ixtatán for Comitán in Chiapas, to enter the Lacandon region via Ocosingo.|$|E

In 1549, the first reduction (reducción in Spanish) of <b>San</b> <b>Mateo</b> Ixtatán took place, overseen by Dominican missionaries, in the same year the Q'anjob'al reducción settlement of Santa Eulalia was founded. Further Q'anjob'al reducciones were in place at San Pedro Soloma, San Juan Ixcoy and San Miguel Acatán by 1560. Q'anjob'al resistance was largely passive, based on withdrawal to the inaccessible mountains and forests from the Spanish reducciones. In 1586 the Mercedarian Order built the first church in Santa Eulalia. The Chuj of <b>San</b> <b>Mateo</b> Ixtatán remained rebellious and resisted Spanish control for longer than their highland neighbours, resistance that was possible owing to their alliance with the lowland Lakandon Ch'ol to the north. The continued resistance was so determined that the Chuj remained pacified only while the immediate effects of the Spanish expeditions lasted.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the Spanish missionary Fray Alonso de León {{reported}} that about eighty families in <b>San</b> <b>Mateo</b> Ixtatán {{did not pay}} tribute to the Spanish Crown or attend the Roman Catholic mass. He described the inhabitants as quarrelsome and complained that they had built a pagan shrine in the hills among the ruins of pre-Columbian temples, where they burnt incense and offerings and sacrificed turkeys. He reported that every March they built bonfires around wooden crosses about two leagues from the town and set them on fire. Fray de León informed the colonial authorities that the practices of the natives were such that they were Christian in name only. Eventually, Fray de León was chased out of <b>San</b> <b>Mateo</b> Ixtatán by the locals.|$|E

5|$|Formal {{planning}} for BART {{began with the}} setting up in 1957 of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, a county-based special-purpose district body that governs the BART system. The district initially began with five members, {{all of which were}} projected to receive BART lines: Alameda County, Contra Costa County, the City and County of San Francisco, <b>San</b> <b>Mateo</b> County, and Marin County. Though invited to participate, Santa Clara County supervisors elected not to join BART in 1957, preferring instead to concentrate on building expressways. In 1962 <b>San</b> <b>Mateo</b> County supervisors voted to leave BART, saying their voters would be paying taxes to carry mainly Santa Clara County residents. The district-wide tax base was weakened by San Mateo's departure, forcing Marin County to withdraw a month later. Despite the fact that Marin had originally voted in favor of BART participation at the 88% level, its marginal tax base could not adequately absorb its share of BART's projected cost. Another important factor in Marin's withdrawal was an engineering controversy over the feasibility of running trains on the lower deck of the Golden Gate Bridge, an extension forecast as late as three decades after the rest of the BART system. The withdrawals of Marin and <b>San</b> <b>Mateo</b> resulted in a downsizing of the original system plans, which would have had lines as far south as Palo Alto and northward past San Rafael. Voters in the three remaining participating counties approved the truncated system, with termini in Fremont, Richmond, Concord, and Daly City, in 1962.|$|E

50|$|Much {{of the now}} Magdalena Ranger District were a {{province}} of the Apache. Bands of Apache effectively controlled the Magdalena-Datil region from the seventeenth century until they were defeated in the Apache Wars {{in the late nineteenth}} century. Outlaw renegades Butch Cassidy and the Wild Bunch and notorious Apaches like Cochise and Geronimo have ties to the <b>San</b> <b>Mateos.</b> Vicks Peak was named after Victorio, “a Mimbreño Apache leader whose territory included much of the south and southwest New Mexico.” Famous for defying relocation orders in 1879 and leading his warriors “on a two-year reign of terror before he was killed,” Victorio is at least as highly regarded as Geronimo or Cochise among Apaches. Perhaps the most famous outlaw was the Apache Kid whose supposed grave lies within the Apache Kid Wilderness. Stories of depredations by the Apache Kid, and of his demise, became so common and dramatic that in southwestern folklore they may be exceeded only by tales of lost Spanish gold. Native Americans lingered in the <b>San</b> <b>Mateos</b> well into the 1900s. We know this by an essay written by Aldo Leopold in 1919 where he documents stumbling upon the remains of a recently abandoned Indian hunting camp.|$|R
