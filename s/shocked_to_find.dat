5|$|On {{the edge}} of the Munassib Depression, Bertram risked a double bluff. From 15 October 1942, a week before the attack, Camouflage {{constructed}} three and a half dummy field regiments of artillery. They were carefully made to appear seriously camouflaged, but day by day, they were maintained less and less well, to allow the enemy to decide it was facing dummy guns at Munassib. When the real battle had begun, the dummies were replaced at night with real artillery, which then kept utterly still for a day. An Axis tank attack on Munassib was <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> itself being fired on by the massed 'dummy' guns.|$|E

Paul took the book to his mentor, Professor Bartholomew Rossi, and was <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> that Rossi had found a similar handmade book when he was a graduate student in the 1930s. As a result, Rossi researched Țepeș, the Dracula myth surrounding him, and the mysterious book. Rossi traveled as far as Istanbul; however, the appearance of curious characters and unexplained events caused him to drop his investigation and return to his graduate work. Rossi gives Paul his research notes and informs him that he believes Dracula is still alive.|$|E

5|$|To ease her heartbreak and the {{rejection}} from her family, Silk turns to alcohol and chain smoking. She gains weight, {{causing her to}} lose her status as a sex symbol. Silk approaches Silva Ganesh with an offer to produce a film together. Ultimately, the audience and industry has lost interest in her, and the film fails. On the other hand, Abraham directs a film which {{turns out to be a}} huge hit, and he feels that he has finally proven to Silk (and himself) that his films do not need any sexualisation to be successful. Having lost her fame and fortune, Silk has accumulated so much debt that she approaches a small-time filmmaker, willing to take on any role. She is <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> that he wants her to do a pornographic film, and she refuses. He intoxicates her with alcohol and starts filming, without her permission.

5|$|After {{watching}} a dinosaur show at an arena in Springfield, Lisa discovers {{one of her}} favorite authors, T. R. Francis, working there in a dinosaur costume. The woman reveals to a shocked Lisa that she is just an actress the book publishing company used for the jacket photos, and that T. R. Francis is a complete fabrication. She further reveals that all popular young-adult book series were never each written by a single author with any inspiration, they are conceived by book publishing executives through market research and the use of multiple ghostwriters, just to make more money. When Homer finds out about this, he decides to get rich by group-writing a fantasy novel. He recruits a team consisting of Bart, Principal Skinner, Patty Bouvier, Moe Szyslak, and Professor Frink, all of whom have personal attributes or experiences that will help with writing the book: Skinner knows what teens like, Patty is a fantasy fiction fan, Moe has already published some children's books, and Frink has a computer. Lisa is <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> that they are group-writing a book, as she knows the only reason one would do that is to gain money. To show that what they are doing is wrong, she decides to write a novel on her own with a personal story that readers will connect with.|$|E

5|$|The {{boys and}} the backpackers visit a water park, where Jay intends to find his ex-girlfriend, Jane. The park staff tell Jay that Jane has found a new job in the vast Outback, which leaves Jay feeling very dejected.

60|$|It {{is a great}} <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{this figure}} sitting in a handsome, baroque, pink-washed shrine {{in one of those}} Alpine valleys which to our {{thinking}} are all flowers and romance, like the picture in the Tate Gallery. 'Spring in the Austrian Tyrol' is to our minds a vision of pristine loveliness. It contains also this Christ of the heavy body defiled by torture and death, the strong, virile life overcome by physical violence, the eyes still looking back bloodshot in consummate hate and misery.|$|R
2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars. Ebert remarked: [...] "We are so {{accustomed}} to 'thrillers' that exist only as machines for creating diversion that it's a <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a movie in which the action, however violent, makes a statement and has a purpose." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying that it [...] "isn't for everyone, but it offers {{a breath of fresh air}} to anyone gasping on the fumes of too many traditional Hollywood thrillers." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was rather}} a <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> <b>find,</b> after the general {{introduction}} was over, that this {{daughter of a}} hundred earls was a stout lady in a plain gown, and a rather weather-beaten bonnet, {{with a bag of}} papers {{in one hand and a}} note-book in the other. But the face was full of benevolence, the sonorous voice very kind, the genial manners very winning, and about the whole person an indescribable air of high breeding which made beauty of no consequence, costume soon forgotten, and the moment memorable to the keen-eyed girls whom nothing escaped.|$|R
5|$|The final major {{campaign}} {{in which the}} PanzerI formed {{a large portion of}} the armoured strength was Operation Barbarossa, 22June 1941. The 3,300 German tanks included about 410 PanzerI's. By the end of the month, {{a large portion of the}} Red Army found itself trapped in the Minsk pocket, and by 21September Kiev had fallen, thereby allowing the Germans to concentrate on their ultimate objective, Moscow. Despite the success of Germany's armour in the Soviet Union, between June and September most German officers were <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> their tanks were inferior to newer Soviet models, the T-34 and KV series. Army Group North quickly realized that none of the tank guns currently in use by German armor could penetrate the thick armour of the KV-1. The performance of the Red Army during the Battle of Moscow and the growing numbers of new Soviet tanks made it obvious the PanzerI was not suitable for this front. Some less battle-worthy PanzerIs were tasked with towing lorries through mud to alleviate logistics problems at the front.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, the two {{armies of}} unequal {{strength}} {{faced each other}} across frozen fields fissured by ice-covered streams and ponds, which were in turn covered by snow and drifts. The snow and gloom meant that neither side {{was aware of the}} inequalities of men and artillery. Napoleon opened the engagement by sending Soult's's corps, which successfully pushed the Russian right flank back, nearly turning the Russian force. To follow up on this success, he ordered Pierre Augereau's force to attack the left center. No sooner had Augereau and VII Corps, plus St. Hilaire's division, sallied out when a sudden snow storm engulfed the battle field. In white-out conditions, Augereau's entire corps disappeared in a flurry of whirling snow. When the snow cleared, friend and foe alike discovered that the first units onto the field had wandered off course. The line of march should have taken them directly to the Russian flank; have no point of reference, they had instead followed the terrain and led the entire corps parallel to the Russian line, along a V-shaped formation in which the left and center merged, and directly into the face of the Russian 70–gun batteries. The artillery, although <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a French Corps advancing straight toward them, immediately opened fire, as did the Russian infantry on both sides of Augereau's corps.|$|E
