40|$|Children {{working in}} {{agriculture}} {{have always been}} a part of the rural culture and work ethos of the United States, especially on the Great Plains. Many teenagers still detassel corn or walk the beans in the summer months to earn spending money or money for college. But what about the children who work as migrant laborers in commercialized agriculture? These children, even today, typically go untracked by governmental agencies. The children may lag behind in school because of their family 2 ̆ 7 s migrations and their frequent absences from school to work in the crops. Unlike the child who works during the summer to earn supplemental income, the migrant family 2 ̆ 7 s wage is often tied to the labor of the child worker. While the majority of commercially grown crops today are worked by migrants on the coasts, the use of child labor in commercialized agriculture in the Great Plains has a long and checkered history. A history of child labor in the early <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> industry in the Great Plains traces two different trends that intersect in the period between 1890 and 1920. The first trend was the movement of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production away from small family farms to large commercial farms in the North Platte Valley of Nebraska and the South Platte Valley of Colorado in the 1890 s. The Great Western Sugar Company and the American Sugar Company, among others, owned the land and recruited the labor to work the beets. The second trend was the arrival of German-Russian families in the 1890 s, and later the arrival of Mexican workers in the Midwest, especially after the Mexican Revolution of 1910. Both groups with their large families played leading roles in the cultivation of this important American crop. Sugar companies hired heads of families knowing that children would also be employed in the fields in order for the families to earn a living wage. In 1905 the private New Yorkbased National Child Labor Committee (NCLC) began looking at child labor in berry picking, and by 1911 had expanded their investigations questioning whether the work of child <b>beet</b> <b>workers</b> was simply family farm chores or actually a form of industrialized agricultural child labor. The investigations of the NCLC, which often included photographs by Lewis Hine, became a part of a decadeslong effort to include agricultural workers in child labor reforms. The legislative highlight of this reform effort was passage during the New Deal of a federal child labor law called the Jones-Costigan Act of 1934. JonesCostigan and the subsequent Sugar Act of 1937 restricted subsidies to farmers who used children in cultivating <b>sugar</b> <b>beets.</b> This legislation did more to protect children in the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> industry than did efforts to unionize agricultural workers in the 1930 s or the mechanization of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> growing during World War II. There was no labor organization among <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>workers</b> in the period between 1890 and 1920. Labor organization among agricultural workers has an irregular history, with efforts to organize on the Great Plains even more sporadic than those on the coasts. Before World War I the radical labor union, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), attempted to organize bindlestiffs, mostly wheat harvesters, in the Midwest and Western states through their Agricultural Workers Organization. Bindlestiffs were adult male harvest hands who carried all their goods in a bundle, or bindle. On the East Coast, the IWW looked into conditions of migrant workers on the truck and tobacco farms through its Agricultural Workers 2 ̆ 7 Industrial Union. Because of the crackdown on radical organizations after the war, most of the IWW 2 ̆ 7 s successes involving migrant workers were short-lived at best, and none specifically involved <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>workers...</b>|$|R

The cotton strikes involved the largest number of workers. Sources vary as to numbers involved in the cotton strikes, with some sources claiming 18,000 workers and others just 12,000 workers. Striking workers were evicted from company housing, and growers and many of their managerial staff were deputized by local law enforcement. Attacks by employers on peaceful striking workers were common. In one attack in the town of Pixley, California, two workers were killed and eight others wounded.

40|$|Introduction: Heat-related {{illnesses}} {{are major}} causes of morbidity in the world. Workers who {{are exposed to}} extreme heat are {{not be able to}} activate their compensatory mechanisms and their health will consequently be at risk. Heat stress due to its impact on work performance increases the likelihood of worker disease and injuries and it also affect productivity. During <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> harvest, farmers from about 8 am to 4 pm, are exposed to sunlight and excessive heat. Therefore, preventive measures are essential {{in order to protect the}} health of farmers and improve productivity. The aim of this project as to study the effectiveness of the rehydration to reduce heat stress and increasing productivity during <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> harvest, conducted in 2012.  . Material and Method: in this project, 20 farmers from <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> farmers were studied during summer season, from 8 am to 4 pm in West Azarbaijan- Boukan city where the average temperature and relative humidity were 29. 85 0 C and 41 %, respectively during <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> harvest. Selection criteria were defined as working more than 50 % of the day’s working schedule and to have worked for at least 10 days of the follow-up period. Individual characteristics and water consumption rate during the work shift and also Production output data by farmers were recorded at the end of the working day. Environmental parameters using a portable monitoring device was measured and recorded and finally, the collected data was used for analysis using spss software version 20.  . Results: WBGT-TWA index for four the period of the time from morning to afternoon obtained 27. 39 0 C, as it was greater than the allowable thresholds.

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} labour have clearly {{established}} that the capitalist state is very involved in the recruitment, relocation and retention of migrant labour forces. Most of the literature tends to analyze migrant labour within the broader social, political and economic context of expanding capitalism. Consequently, studies {{tend to focus on}} how the use of migrant labour is profitable to capitalism because it is cheap and easy to exploit. Such studies, however, neglect {{the ways in which the}} state actually intervenes in the labour market in order to facilitate the flow of migrant workers to places of employment. Therefore, this thesis explores the relationship between the migration of labour, the state and the reserve army of labour through an analysis of the Native migrant work force in the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> industry in southern Alberta. Through the use of archival material, which includes various federal and provincial documents, annual reports of the Alberta <b>Sugar</b> <b>Beet</b> Growers' Association, newspapers and other materials, the circumstances underlying state intervention in the economy of the southern <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> industry became clear. While analyzing the structure of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> industry in southern Alberta, it was found that throughout much of the history of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> industry, farmers received low returns for their beet crops. Moreover, farmers also suffered financially from the high cost of machinery and, more recently, from the increased costs for fertilizer and chemical weed controls. An examination of government documents on the FederalProvincial Agricultural Manpower Committee, whose mandate was to recruit workers and move them to areas of need in agricultural sectors throughout Canada, revealed that the federal part of the committee was represented by officials from the Department of Manpower and Immigration and, beginning in the early 1950 s, officials from the Department of Indian Affairs, who represented Indians on reserves. When the working conditions in <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> industry were examined, it was found that they were very poor for <b>beet</b> <b>workers.</b> In general, the weeding and hoeing of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> was difficult and the housing accommodations inadequate. Moreover, because of the low return on their beet crops and the high costs of machinery, fertilizer and weed control, the farmers had to keep the cost of labour as low as possible, which, meant paying low wages to <b>beet</b> <b>workers.</b> Moreover, it was found that throughout much the history of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> industry in southern Alberta, agricultural workers were unprotected by labour laws, which, was very conducive to reproducing conditions for cheap labour. Consequently, few wanted to work in the beet fields of southern Alberta if other employment could be found. Prior to the 1950 s the state recruited immigrant workers and even prisoners of war from internment camps to supply farmers with the needed labour for their beet crops. However, in the early 1950 s unskilled immigrant labour could no longer be procured for beet work. It was at this time that the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> industry, through the Federal-Provincial Agricultural Manpower Committee, turned to recruiting Natives, particulary northern Alberta and northern Saskatchewan reserve Indians, to perform their labour requirements. In order to maintain this needed work force, the state helped organize Native migratation to southern Alberta at the start of the beet season and also helped ensure that they stayed there for the duration of the needed period...|$|R

40|$|In Kenya, the {{government}} is promoting high-value and drought resistant crop varieties {{in an effort to}} reduce poverty in rural areas. <b>Sugar</b> <b>beet</b> is one such crop. This study was conducted with two objectives: 1) to assess the opportunities and challenges for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation and adoption in the Nyandarua district of Kenya and 2) to assess whether <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> adoption can offer an opportunity for escaping poverty for smallholder farmers in the district. The factors favoring <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation and adoption in the district include: adequate land area suitable for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation and the high <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> yield that can be attained per unit suitable land area, farmers' awareness of the positive aspects of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation, and the willingness of many farmers to grow the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> crop. Notwithstanding these favorable conditions, some socio-economic factors-mainly the affordability of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production and possible lack of appropriate farming technologies, will present challenges to widespread <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> adoption, particularly to those farmers in the low-and medium-income categories. The <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> profit analysis showed that depending on the market price, <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> can potentially increase household net income. However, since the majority of households are in the low-and medium-income categories, for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> to pull the smallholder farmers out of poverty, interventions from government and other stakeholders is of vital necessity. The impact of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> adoption and cultivation will vary from household to household. Those households within the high-income category who can raise the required start up capital are likely to benefit, while the low-and medium-income households may not, which is true for any new crop with high start up costs. Alternative agriculture alone is therefore not a sufficient strategy to address the problems of poverty and unemployment. Any successful strategy to address these issues must be broad-based, and include alternative agriculture and other growth and development strategies.

40|$|Abstract. The {{process of}} {{intensive}} transformation {{to which the}} <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> market in the European Union has been subject {{in recent years in}} order to meet the external obligations set by the WTO Panel, has had a severe impact on <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production in Poland. Two major observations have been reported, namely a significant decrease of number of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> farms and a reduction in those areas of tillage surfaces intended for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation. It is worth mentioning that <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> is highly important to crop rotation and hardly any other plant in European agriculture can replace it. There is therefore both a strong need and a great opportunity for the further support and development of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production. As the interna-tional obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emission became effective, interest in biomass us-age as a viable alternative to fossil fuels increased. This study thus set out to perform an eco-nomic comparison in respect of the use of <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> for traditional purposes and for energy, and to conduct an economic analysis of the income obtained from the sale of electrical energy sale by a biogas facility where <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> were used for biogas production.

Based on the expected selling price of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> amounting to EUR 34 per ton of standard quality <b>sugar</b> <b>beet,</b> and using the break-even method, it was determined that the quantity required to cover total costs in <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production in the Republic of Croatia amounts to 55. 26 tons per hectare of payable <b>sugar</b> <b>beet,</b> standard quality, i. e. 8. 84 tons of polarized sugar per hectare. As the average <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production in the Republic of Croatia, expressed in the equivalent of polarized sugar, amounts to 7. 8 tons per hectare, it is obvious that an average Croatian producer of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet,</b> without income from subsidies, operates at a loss.

40|$|Abstract Previous {{studies have}} shown that weight and sugar content {{decrease}} during <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> storage in silos. Different parameter such as size of <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> and height of storage, can affect on changes of weight and sugar. These parameters arewere considered in this study. Therefore, random sampling was done from <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> that had been carried to Shirvan <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> factory silos. Samples were divided in 4 groups of size (large, medium, small and mixed). These groups were stored in 4 different heights in industrial Shirvan <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> factory silos and after 18 days, pol and weight of beets were measured and were compared with data obtained on first day (before storing). The results showed that during storage of <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> in silos, maximum weight and sugar loses belonged to small <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> with 5. 54 to 6. 97 and 3. 86 to 4. 13 percent decrease, respectively. Also minimum weight and sugar loses belonged to samples that were stored in floor of silos with 1. 69 to 1. 91 percent decrease. Increasing of height of storage resulted to increase of weight lose, so maximum of weight lose belonged to <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> that were stored in 5 meter height (silos level) and amount of it was 6. 37 to 9. 84 percent. Furthermore, results showed that maximum of sugar lose belonged to <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> that were stored in the lowest height in this study and amount of it was between 4. 80 to 5. 20 percent. Increasing the height of storage caused to decreasing of sugar loses, as sugar loses of <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> that was stored on the uppermost level were obtained between 1. 77 to 2. 20 percent.

40|$|In Kenya the {{government}} is promoting diversification of crops to embrace high value crops and drought resistant crop varieties in efforts to reduce poverty in rural areas. <b>Sugar</b> <b>beet</b> {{is one of the}} crops considered as an option in this context and it is therefore important to increase knowledge about the potentials in the country for cultivating this crop. <b>Sugar</b> <b>beet</b> trials conducted in Nyandarua and Butere Mumias Districts of Kenya have shown that the crop yields are comparable to those obtained in traditional sugar-beet cultivation regions of Europe. Since <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> yield is affected by climate and soils, the results of Nyandarua and Butere Mumias <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> trials are not adequate to propose that comparable yields can be obtained elsewhere in the country and other tropical regions. Physical land evaluations assessing the potentials and constraints for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production are therefore essential. The objectives {{of this study was to}} develop a Tropical <b>Sugar</b> <b>Beet</b> Land Evaluation Scheme (TSBLES) that can aid assessment of the suitability of different areas in the tropics for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation; and to test this scheme for an assessment of suitable <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> zones and land areas in Kenya. The development of the scheme was based on various literature sources and expert judgment on <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> requirements, and a Tropical <b>Sugar</b> <b>Beet</b> yield prediction Model. The TSBLES accounts for physical conditions of land i. e. climatic, edaphic and topographic conditions. According to the assessment results 27 % of the land area in Kenya is suitable for <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> cultivation. Of this area, 5 % is highly suitable, another 5 % is moderately suitable and 17 % is marginally suitable. Most of the highly suitable land area is concentrated in Rift Valley, Central and Nyanza provinces. The Rift Valley has the highest share of the suitable land area...|$|R

40|$|The United States {{produces}} about 1. 8 {{million tons}} of sugar annually. Approximately 75 per cent of this production is derived from <b>sugar</b> <b>beets.</b> The importance of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> crop in national and world economy is justification for research effort {{as a means to}} more economical production. It is desirable that <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> processing be carried out in the most efficient manner. More effective utilization of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> and its by-products will add stability to the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> industry. For the past 170 years, since Achard found that sugar could be used for human consumption and that pulp might be fed to cattle, sugar processors have made limited use of the non-sugar constituents of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet.</b> These materials have been disposed of almost exclusively as livestock ration supplements. The non-sugar constituents have been largely responsible for failure to extract all of the <b>sugar</b> from the <b>beet</b> (13). As a result they have been viewed with suspicion by most <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> processors. However, recent development suggest that the utilization of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> by-products will constitute a more important phase of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> industry in the future. At this critical period in the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> industry, it is difficult to overemphasize the need for {{a better understanding of the}} chemical constituents of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> and the effects of various physiological factors upon them. One of the non-sugar constituents of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> which has recently received attention is glutamic acid. This has been brought about primarily by the discovery that the salt, monosodium glutamate, has an enhancing effect upon the flavor and palatability of many foods. Using the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> as almost the exclusive source of glutamic acid, a new industry (utilizing over 100 tons of beet molasses daily) has developed to manufacture and market this food seasoner (28). Preliminary investigations at the Utah Experiment Station (14) showed that of all the chemical constituents determined, glutamic acid was the most variable. This agreed with earlier work in this field (16, 42). Being highly variable this constituent is a chief contributor to difficulties in sugar processing. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of some of the major agronomic factors, such as moisture, fertility, variety, and sampling date, upon the glutamic acid content of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Sugar</b> <b>beet</b> {{production}} {{was responsible for}} 56. 6 percent of all U. S. sugar production in 2014. 82 percent of this production came from the states of Minnesota, North Dakota, Idaho, and Michigan. <b>Sugar</b> <b>beets</b> are an important crop for growers in these states so {{research in this area}} could be of great value to them. Current U. S. sugar policy protects domestic sugar prices from falling below set target rates. However, there has been very little research that describes the relationship of changing <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> prices above these target rates, with different economic variables. This study explores the potential relationship U. S. <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> prices have with domestic <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production, world <b>sugar</b> prices, incomes, and U. S. sugar imports. With the results, U. S. <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> producers might make better pre-plant decisions such as acreage allotments. <b>Sugar</b> <b>beet</b> processors might have more information available to them for pricing of their sugar products and interest groups might see the possible impacts of proposed policy changes for the U.
