25|$|This enigmatic {{structure}} stands erect around 12.5 meters tall (~ 35 feet), with a linear, cubical {{shape and}} a square base (~ 22 feet in sides), constructed {{in what is}} essentially a dug out rectangular depression, having on {{all but one of}} its sides, four rectangular depressions resembling blind windows, and multiple minute rectangular depressions in the façade interdispersed among the blind windows as well as the side housing the staircase. The staircase leads to a small door (5 feet by 6 feet in dimensions) opening to an interior apartment of about 12 feet square. The structure's roof houses a minimal entablature of a repeating <b>square</b> <b>pattern.</b> The entire structure is posited on a raised stone platform that is composed of a few stone slabs, in a sequentially smaller yet in a concentric, pyramidally shaped succession. This structure is enigmatic, both in its aesthetic choice seen in its rather odd design, and façade, as well as its location, and supposed function.|$|E

In this paper, we consider various requires/allows questions connected with sign pattern matrices and generalized inverses. In particular, we investigate the class of all <b>square</b> <b>patterns</b> A for which there exist B, C ϵ Q(A) where BCB=B. For nonnegative patterns, we characterize and show that coincides with the class of all <b>square</b> <b>patterns</b> A for which there exists B ϵ Q(A) where B 3 =B. Nonnegative <b>square</b> <b>patterns</b> that allow an idempotent and those that allow a (1, 3) -inverse are each characterized. Some interesting open questions are also indicated...|$|R

2500|$|However, {{these are}} based upon {{assumptions}} of estimating inside heat transfer coefficient, predicting flow around {{the outside of the}} coil, and upon constant heat flux. [...] Yet, recent experimental data revealed that the empirical correlations are quite in agreement for designing circular and <b>square</b> <b>pattern</b> HCHEs. [...] During studies published in 2015, several researchers found that the boundary conditions of the outer wall of exchangers were essentially constant heat flux conditions in power plant boilers, condensers and evaporators; while convective heat transfer conditions were more appropriate in food, automobile and process industries.|$|E
2500|$|Another, albeit {{less common}} offense, is the [...] "motion c", {{sometimes}} nicknamed [...] "washing machine offence", {{in which two}} [...] "weak-side" [...] (to {{the right of the}} goal for right-handed players) perimeter players set up as a wing and a flat. [...] The remaining four players swim in <b>square</b> <b>pattern</b> in which a player swims from the point to the hole and then out to the strong side wing. The wing moves to the flat and the flat to the point. The weak side wing and flat then control the tempo of play and try to make passes into the player driving towards the centre forward who can then either shoot or pass. This form of offence is used when no dominate hole set is available, or the hole defence is too strong. It is also seen much more often in women's water polo where teams may lack a player of sufficient size or strength to set up in the centre forward. The best advantage to this system is it makes man-coverage much more difficult for the defender and allows the offence to control the game tempo better once the players are [...] "set up". The main drawback is this constant motion can be very tiring as well as somewhat predictable as to where the next pass is going to go.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{excitation}} of spatial patterns by resonant, multi-frequency forcing in systems undergoing a Hopf bifurcation to spatially homogeneous oscillations. Using weakly nonlinear analysis {{we show that}} for small amplitudes only stripe or hexagon patterns are linearly stable, whereas <b>square</b> <b>patterns</b> and patterns involving more than three modes are unstable. In the case of hexagon patterns up- and down-hexagons can be simultaneously stable. The third-order, weakly nonlinear analysis predicts stable <b>square</b> <b>patterns</b> and super-hexagons for larger amplitudes. Direct simulations show, however, that in this regime the third-order weakly nonlinear analysis is insufficient, and these patterns are, in fact unstable...|$|R

The 1982 VAM Gremlin returned as a slightly consolidated model. Both trim levels incorporated amber front parking lights and the AMC <b>square</b> <b>pattern</b> grille design {{that was used in}} U.S. domestic Eagle models. The base model incorporated chromed headlight bezels with blacked out internal areas while the X model were completely blacked out as also was the hood trim molding. The [...] I6 was upgraded {{for the first time since}} 1976, receiving a higher 8.5:1 compression ratio and net output of [...] at 4000rpm. This was achieved through a new head design that incorporated smaller spark plug outlets and a plastic valve cover. The A904 model automatic transmission was replaced in favor of the A998 model with wider gear ratios. The base model was similar to the prior year's except for new side trim and front end design. The X model saw the return of side decals the form of four thin stripes starting at the base of the B-pillar trim molding running all the way to the front edge of the fenders near the marker lights. A new silver [...] "GX" [...] decal appeared between the rear window and the right side tail light. For some reason, the sports steering wheel was replaced by the base design. The model was restricted to a three-speed automatic transmission with the novelty of the AMX/GT's console-type shifter boot and the rear differential changed to a [...] 3.07:1 ratio as used the year before with the now-unavailable four-speed manual.|$|E
