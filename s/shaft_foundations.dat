40|$|To achieve more cost {{efficient}} transportation infrastructure {{within the state}} of Arkansas, a series of cost-benefit analyses were performed. The analyses, specifically developed for load resistance factor design (LRFD) designed drilled <b>shaft</b> <b>foundations,</b> were designed to compare the fiscal impacts of the drilling and sampling, in-field and laboratory testing, full-scale load testing, and concrete mixing techniques utilized by the University of Arkansas (UofA), the Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department (AHTD), and the Missouri Department of Transportation (MODOT). The methodologies were compared at three test site locations within the state of Arkansas: Siloam Springs, AR, Turrell, AR, and Monticello, AR. These sites were selected to represent the predominant geological deposits within the state. Three drilled <b>shaft</b> <b>foundations</b> (two four-foot diameter drilled shafts and one six-foot diameter drilled shaft) were each constructed at the Siloam Springs Arkansas Test Site (SSATS) and the Turrell Arkansas Test Site (TATS). A drilled shaft database was developed containing soil properties, and predicted and measured results of the full-scale load tests performed upon each drilled shaft. Cost-benefit analyses for each methodology were compared by means of predicted and measured static axial capacity. Values of predicted axial capacity were generated for each methodology using the Bridge Software Institute FB-Deep, Ensoft SHAFTv 2012, and Microsoft Excel® spreadsheet programs. Based {{on the results of}} the full-scale load testing, the FB-Deep program utilizing the data from the UofA sampling and testing method was selected as the best methodology for predicting the axial capacity values for drilled <b>shaft</b> <b>foundations</b> in the state of Arkansas.

40|$|Drilled <b>shaft</b> <b>foundations</b> are {{increasingly}} being used to support various types of buildings and infrastructure facilities. The load carrying capacity of these drilled shafts is largely dependent on their diameter. The large loads carried by such structural elements make quality control and assurance of their diameters during construction extremely critical. Current methods adopted by the industry for measuring drilled shaft diameters during construction depend on discrete points of concrete volumetric measurements that lack both accuracy and continuity. An empirical model is developed and {{presented in this paper}} for computing the diameter of drilled <b>shaft</b> <b>foundations</b> that overcomes these limitations. The model is developed using signal processing performed on cross-hole sonic logging (CSL) experimental data obtained from three drilled shaft specimens. The model is validated using experimental data obtained from two separate specimens.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Drilled <b>shaft</b> <b>foundations</b> {{on major}} bridge {{projects}} often {{require the use}} of underwater placement of large volumes of concrete through densely placed rebar, with the cage often made even more congested with the placement of additional tubes for post-construction integrity testing.

The concept of “high performance ” for drilled shaft concrete is that the mixture should address the most critical performance requirements related to workability.

40|$|Drilled shafts are {{a common}} type of deep {{foundations}} used to support {{a wide array of}} infrastructure facilities such as bridges, high mast lighting, tanks and communication towers.

The bridges are modeled as single-and multispan elastic frames founded on a homogeneous soil layer over rigid rock.

Response of a single-span symmetric bridge is obtained by decomposing the excitation into symmetric and antisymmetric components.

The proposed model constitutes an extension to a deformable base of the elastodynamic solution of a rigid fixed-base cylinder imbedded in a homogeneous or inhomogeneous soil stratum with different lateral boundary conditions. The analytical model has been validated by means of a finite elements code and it has been implemented in a consistent seismic soil-structure-interaction analysis procedure. An application of the model to a long, multispan continuous prestressed concrete viaduct with tall piers has been carried out focusing on the importance of kinematic interaction. The main result is that the foundation input motion is characterised not only by a translational horizontal component which is usually of a reduced amplitude if compared with the free-field ground motion, but also by a rotation component that is responsible for a large seismic demand in the superstructure.

40|$|Drilled shafts {{have been}} used in the US for more than 100 years in bridges and {{buildings}} as a deep foundation alternative. For many of these applications, the drilled shafts were designed using the Working Stress Design (WSD) approach. Even though WSD has been used successfully in the past, a move toward Load Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) for foundation applications began when the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) issued a policy memorandum on June 28, 2000. The policy memorandum requires all new bridges initiated after October 1, 2007, to be designed according to the LRFD approach. This ensures compatibility between the superstructure and substructure designs, and provides a means of consistently incorporating sources of uncertainty into each load and resistance component. Regionally-calibrated LRFD resistance factors are permitted by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) to improve the economy and competitiveness of drilled shafts. To achieve this goal, a database for Drilled <b>SHAft</b> <b>Foundation</b> Testing (DSHAFT) has been developed.

Drilled shaft foundation elements provide a cost-effective foundation alternative for the support of building and bridge superstructure loads. Bi-directional pile loading tests (BDPLTs) to evaluate the capacity of drilled shafts have become popular owing to their capacity to save time and effort as compared to the use of top-down loading tests. However, the use of BDPLTs requires that production shafts be post-grouted following testing in order to assure appropriate in-service performance. Commonly used single-acting loading cells and/or loading cell construction details can pose the potential for the development of voids following post-grouting due to their monotonic jacking action and large footprint. This paper described the development and use of high pressure bi-directional loading cells intended to minimize the possibility of post-test construction defects. First, a comparison was made between the single-acting and double-acting loading cells. Second, the results of laboratory calibrations on the pressurized loading cells were performed, as were component testing of the pumps, hoses, and hydraulic fluid synchronization lines. Then, the use of the new high pressure double-acting loading cells in production testing of instrumented shafts was described, and the efficacy of the new loading cells was illustrated. The new loading cells provided the profession with a load cell alternative for conducting BDLTs and should serve to help reduce the risk of post-test grouting defects in drilled <b>shaft</b> <b>foundations...</b>|$|E
40|$|Drilled <b>shaft</b> <b>foundations</b> usually carry {{very high}} design loads, and often {{serve as a}} single {{load-carrying}} unit. These conditions have created {{a need for a}} high-level of quality assurance during and after construction process. During the construction process, different types of anomalies such as necking, soft-bottom gap at the base, voids and soil intrusions can occur. Anomalies throughout the length can significantly reduce the axial load capacity of the drilled shaft. This paper studies the effect of voids inside and outside the reinforcement cage on the strength and structural capacity of drilled shafts. The objective of this research is to quantify the extent of loss in axial strength and stiffness of drilled shafts due to presence of three different types of symmetric voids throughout their lengths; also, to evaluate the potential for buckling of longitudinal bars within the various types of voids. To complete these objectives, fifteen large-scale drilled shaft samples were built and tested using a hydraulic actuator at the Florida International University’s (FIU) Titan America Structures and Construction Testing (TASCT) laboratory. During the static load test, load-displacement curves were recorded by the data acquisition system (MegaDAC). Results show that the presence of symmetric voids outside the rebar cage (void Type C) that occupy 40 % of the cross sectional area of the drilled shafts cause 27 % reduction in the axial capacity, while the symmetric voids that penetrate inside the core (void Type B) cause 47 % reduction in the axial capacity. The findings indicate that the voids Type B decrease the capacity and stiffness of drilled shafts more than other types due to the resulting inadequate confinement of the concrete and reinforcement.

To achieve {{part of this}} goal, a database for Drilled Shaft Foundation Testing (DSHAFT) was developed and reported on by Garder, Ng, Sritharan, and Roling in 2012. DSHAFT is aimed at assimilating high-quality drilled shaft test data from Iowa and the surrounding regions. DSHAFT is currently housed on a project website ([URL] and contains data for 41 drilled shaft tests. The objective {{of this research was}} to utilize the DSHAFT database and develop a regional LRFD procedure for drilled shafts in Iowa with preliminary resistance factors using a probability-based reliability theory. This was done by examining current design and construction practices used by the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) as well as recommendations given in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) LRFD Bridge Design Specifications and the FHWA drilled shaft guidelines. Various analytical methods were used to estimate side resistance and end bearing of drilled shafts in clay, sand, intermediate geomaterial (IGM), and rock. Since most of the load test results obtained from O-cell do not pass the 1 -in. top displacement criterion used by the Iowa DOT and the 5 % of shaft diameter for top displacement criterion recommended by AASHTO, three improved procedures are proposed to generate and extend equivalent top load-displacement curves that enable the quantification of measured resistances corresponding to the displacement criteria.

40|$|In this paper, some of {{the effects}} of {{unbalance}} on the nonlinear response and stability of flexible rotor-bearing systems is presented from both a theoretical and experimental standpoint. In a linear system, operating above its stability threshold, the amplitude of motion grows exponentially with time and the orbits become unbounded. In an actual system, this is not necessarily the case. The actual amplitudes of motion may be bounded due to various nonlinear effects in the system. These nonlinear effects cause limit cycles of motion. Nonlinear effects are inherent in fluid film bearings and seals. Other contributors to nonlinear effects are <b>shafts,</b> couplings and <b>foundations.</b> In addition to affecting the threshold of stability, the nonlinear effects can cause jump phenomena to occur at not only the critical speeds, but also at stability onset or restabilization speeds...|$|R
