2500|$|Generally, {{treatments}} for apraxia have received little attention for several reasons, including {{the tendency for}} the condition to resolve spontaneously in acute cases. Additionally, {{the very nature of}} the automatic-voluntary dissociation of motor abilities that defines apraxia means that patients may still be able to automatically perform activities if cued to do so in daily life. Nevertheless, research shows that patients experiencing apraxia have less functional independence in their daily lives, and that evidence for the treatment of apraxia is scarce. However, a literature review of apraxia treatment to date reveals that although the field is in its early stages of treatment design, certain aspects can be included to treat apraxia. [...] One method is through rehabilitative treatment, which has been found to positively impact apraxia, as well as activities of daily living. [...] In this review, rehabilitative treatment consisted of 12 different contextual cues, which were used in order to teach patients how to produce the same gesture under different contextual situations. [...] Additional studies have also recommended varying forms of gesture therapy, whereby the patient is instructed to make gestures (either using objects or symbolically meaningful and non-meaningful gestures) with progressively less cuing from the therapist. It may be necessary for patients with apraxia to use a form of alternative and augmentative communication depending on the severity of the disorder. In addition to using gestures as mentioned, patients can also use communication boards or more sophisticated electronic devices if needed. [...] No single type of therapy or approach has been proven as the best way to treat a patient with apraxia, since each patient's case varies. However, one-on-one sessions usually work the best, with the support of family members and friends. Since everyone responds to therapy differently, some patients will make significant improvements, while others will make less progress. The overall goal for treatment of apraxia is to treat the motor plans for speech, not treating at the phoneme (sound) level. Research suggests that individuals with apraxia of speech should receive treatment that focuses on the repetition of target words and rate of speech. Research rerouted that the overall goal for treatment of apraxia should be to improve <b>speech</b> <b>intelligibility,</b> rate of speech and articulation of targeted words.|$|E

40|$|It is {{possible}} to increase the <b>intelligibility</b> of <b>speech</b> in noise by enhancing the clean speech signal. In this paper we demonstrate the effects of modifying the spectral envelope of synthetic speech according to the environmental noise. To achieve this, we modify Mel cepstral coefficients according to an intelligibility measure that accounts for glimpses of speech in noise: the Glimpse Proportion measure. We evaluate this method against a baseline synthetic voice trained only with normal speech and a topline voice trained with Lombard speech, as well as natural <b>speech.</b> The <b>intelligibility</b> of these voices was measured when mixed with speech-shaped noise and with a competing speaker at three different levels. The Lombard voices, both natural and synthetic, were more intelligible than the normal voices in all conditions. For speechshaped noise, the proposed modified voice was as intelligible as the Lombard synthetic voice without requiring any recordings of Lombard speech, which are hard to obtain. However, {{in the case of}} competing talker noise, the Lombard synthetic voice was more intelligible than the proposed modified voice.

40|$|Talkers adopt {{different}} speech {{styles in}} response to {{factors such as the}} perceived needs of the interlocutor, environmental noise and explicit instruction. Some styles {{have been shown to be}} beneficial for listeners but many aspects of the relationship between <b>speech</b> modifications and <b>intelligibility</b> remain unclear, particularly for prosodic changes. The current study measures the relative intelligibility in noise of speech spoken in 5 speech styles – plain, infant-, computer- and foreigner-directed, and shouted – and relates listener scores to acoustic/prosodic parameters and quantitative estimates of energetic masking. Intelligibility changes over plain speech correlated well with durational modifications, which included elongations of all segments as well as increases in the number of unfilled pauses. Both mean fundamental frequency and its range displayed great variation across styles but with no clear intelligibility benefits. Energetic masking per unit time was similar in each style but the total amount of speech which escaped masking was a good predictor of word identification rate. These findings suggest that much of the prosody-related intelligibility gain is derived from durational increases. Index Terms: <b>speech</b> styles, prosody, <b>intelligibility</b> 1...|$|R

It also introduces the development of English as a lingua franca and its impact on pronunciation. Finally, it characterises the processes of speech perception. The practical part describes the creation and implementation of research which aimed at the discovery of the degree of intelligibility and comprehensibility of rhotic and non-rhotic samples of speech.
