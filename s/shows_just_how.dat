25|$|While {{researching the}} First Folios in the Folger Library, Robert Evans came across an epitaph for Shakespeare that was {{previously}} unrecorded. The epitaph appears in verse, {{similar to that}} of the sonnets, and <b>shows</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> highly Shakespeare's contemporaries thought of his work. The lines of the epitaph themselves echo lines from sonnet 55, which bring into thought the ideas of that particular sonnet itself. Through the verses of the sonnet, the young man becomes immortal. Through the verses of the epitaph, as well as the larger context of praise for the dead poet, Shakespeare himself becomes immortal, echoing and reinforcing his very argument in sonnet 55.|$|E
25|$|Many people {{dedicated}} {{their time}} to creating memorials and funds in Lloyd's name post death. A significant amount of effort was put into creating these, which <b>shows</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> {{much of an impact}} she made on the life of her students. There is not much released to the public about Lloyd despite her being a figure who fought for educational programs to benefit women at a time when progressive movements had not taken preeminence. This is most clearly shown in a correspondence between the editor of A Biographical Dictionary and Mary T. Bromage, who spent significant time on a biography of Lloyd over whether she {{should be included in the}} dictionary. The editor, Edward James believed Lloyd did not have much influence outside of Michigan despite her numerous leadership positions before her death. Nevertheless, her legacy continues to live on to this day and is seen in the numerous advancements that women have made at the University of Michigan and in higher education as a whole.|$|E

[...] The foundation began accepting new donations from foreign governments, which it had stopped doing while she was secretary. However, even though the Clinton Foundation had stopped taking donations from foreign governments, they continued to take large donations from foreign citizens who were sometimes linked to their governments.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{working with}} Lovato on her third studio album, Unbroken, Ryan Tedder stated, [...] "Demi blew {{me out of}} the water vocally! I had no idea how good her voice is. She's one of the best singers I've ever worked with. Literally, that good... I mean, she's a Kelly Clarkson-level vocalist. And Kelly has a set of pipes." [...] He also commented on their work {{together}} on the song [...] "Neon Lights" [...] from Lovato's fourth studio album, saying, [...] "She, in pop music, has one of the biggest ranges, possibly the highest full voice singer I've ever worked with."

Levine's vocal range spans from the low note of D4 to the high note of G5. [...] "Sad" [...] highlights Levine's soulful tone that his voice possesses. Nick Levine of NME labeled the song as [...] "an Adele-apeing weepie". Similarly, The New York Times Nate Chinen compared [...] "Sad" [...] to Adele's 2011 single [...] "Someone Like You". Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote that it [...] "echoes Elton John in terms of epic scope and <b>shows</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> vulnerable Levine can get." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Sad" [...] is a song on which Levine [...] "achingly" [...] declares {{the end of his}} relationship and his heartbreak. According to Jacqui Swift, it was inspired by the singer's break up with Victoria's Secret model Anne Vyalitsyna. The song begins with the lyrics, [...] "Man, it's been a long day stuck thinking 'bout it." [...] The chorus is simple and consists of Levine singing [...] "I'm so Sad".|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the game spawned a franchise, with 16 sequels or {{spin-offs}} released to date. Due to its complex physics engine and abundance of possible shortcuts, Super Monkey Ball has been popular with professional speedrunners. A 2006 {{study conducted by the}} Beth Israel Medical Center found that surgeons who played the game for 20 minutes prior to performing a surgical drill finished slightly faster and made fewer mistakes. Super Monkey Ball inspired Neverball, a free game for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, Dreamcast, and iOS. In 2006, Nintendo Power ranked it the 38th best game available on Nintendo platforms, commenting [...] "who knew that such cute characters with cinnamon roll ears could be the source of so much tension (when the clock is ticking) and so much relief (when they finally break the ribbon)?"

[...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine gave the compilation four out of five stars and commented that [...] "functionally, what Madonna and fans are really celebrating with the release of Celebration is the hard proof that Madonna's back catalogue is now so immense and so varied that she can release a behemoth, two-disc greatest hits package that shoehorns in 36 songs and still manages to significantly short-change the singer's legacy", though also noticing that [...] "the album is missing songs, doesn't always include the right ones, [...] seems to have been sequenced by a not particularly intuitive Genius playlist." [...] Tim Sendra from AllMusic praised that [...] "the collection does a fine job of living up to the title— it's certainly a celebration of Madonna's career and includes some of the most celebratory and thrilling pop music ever created." [...] While reviewing the double-disc deluxe edition version of the album, he commented: [...] "The 34-track double-disc Deluxe Edition has an easier time of it than the single-disc 18-track release does."

2500|$|Correspondence with García Lorca <b>shows</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> {{painstaking}} he was, spending months polishing, revising and correcting {{poems that}} he had already written and published, {{to a point where}} they were practically unrecognisable from the way they had first appeared in public. [...] Clarity and coherence were his major objectives but he also seemed to wish to avoid obvious self-revelation and any hint of sentimentality. [...] Lorca’s reaction in a postcard to Guillén written on 27 December 1928 captures the elements that dominate most critical responses to the latter’s poetry: [...] an opposition between the jubilant, physical celebration of reality that his poems try to capture and, on the other hand, its extreme technical purity, which can seem cold and overly intellectual.|$|E
2500|$|The global online auto review site Autoguide.com tested Tesla's {{fourth-generation}} car in October 2010.

The Tesla <b>shows</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> good zero-emissions [...] "green" [...] technology can be. Quite frankly, getting into a normal car {{at the end of}} the test drive was a major letdown. The whirr of the engine, the shove in the backside and the little roadster that seems to pivot around you is replaced by a grunting, belching, feedback-free driving experience". He continues on that [...] "but for a $100,000 car, it could use some work" [...] complaining of purposefully cheap work.|$|E

2500|$|Derby matches, [...] {{which are}} matches between two {{neighbouring}} rival clubs, are often fiercely competitive. Sometimes there are underlying political or sectarian tensions.

Derbies are usually treated as the most important matches by the fans, players and clubs, regardless of position in the league table, et cetera. The film Green Street embodies the spirit of derbies when one of the characters refers to the West Ham United versus Millwall Football Club rivalry as that of Israel against Palestine. Of course this film does focus on the mostly past era of hooliganism, however its depiction of matchday passion <b>shows</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> important derby day is to fans. When it comes to derbies, the culture of football thrives and shines in all its colours. How Soccer Explains the World is a perfect source into how derbies emerged and what they mean to the community.|$|E

There he was boasting and bragging {{to himself}} {{of what he}} would do to some one whom he hadn't even seen, all because he had found a sign that told him the Old Pasture, in which he had made up his mind to make his new home, was already the home of some one else. Peter was like a lot of other people; he wasn't fair. No, Sir, he wasn't fair. He let his own desires destroy his sense of fair play. It was all right for him to put up signs in the dear Old Briar-patch and the Green Forest, warning other Rabbits that they must keep away, but it was all wrong for another Rabbit {{to do the same thing}} in the Old Pasture. Oh, my, yes! That was quite a {{different}} matter! The very thought of it made Peter very, very angry. When he thought of this other Rabbit, it was always as the stranger. That <b>shows</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> unfair Peter was, because, you see, Peter himself was really the stranger.
