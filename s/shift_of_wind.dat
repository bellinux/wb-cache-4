[...] Within five minutes after the fire was first noticed, it had spread to the Alice. [...] Both boats were nearly consumed within ten minutes.

There were numerous fires burning in Berkeley, while Oakland and San Francisco were apparently being swept by vast conflagrations.

60|$|This was true. He {{had been}} reading the chapter on the storms. When he had entered the chart-room, it was with no {{intention}} of taking the book down.

He lost himself amongst advancing semi-circles, left- and right-hand quadrants, the curves of the tracks, the probable bearing of the centre, the <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> and the readings of barometer.

40|$|International audienceSince the 1980 's, the {{sea surface}} {{temperature}} of the Agulhas Current system has increased significantly. The warming is due to an augmentation of its transport {{in response to an}} increase in wind stress curl in the South Indian Ocean at relevant latitudes. This causes an increase in the fluxes of salt and heat into the Atlantic Ocean and in the transfer of energy from the ocean to the atmosphere. Therefore, the changes we are witnessing in the region could have far reaching consequences on top of the regional impacts on ecosystem and climate. The increase in wind stress curl is consistent with a poleward <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> westerly <b>wind</b> in the Southern Hemisphere reported by others...|$|R
40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. Prevailing {{trade winds}} {{are a major}} {{component}} of the atmospheric circulation over the tropical Pacific and have significant influence on the climate in Hawaii. In order to determine if the frequency and intensity of the northeast trades have changed from 1984 - 2009, wind observation data from land and buoy stations around the Hawaiian Islands are analyzed. Using a nonparametric trend analysis, all stations are consistent in displaying a downward trend in northeast trade wind frequency, although the slope of the trend is variable for each station. On the contrary, the frequency of the east trade winds is shown to have increased over the past 26 years. After extending the period of study from 1973 - 2009, {{it was found that the}} northeast (east) trade frequency show decreasing (increasing) trends, similar to previous results found from the post 1984 - 2009 data set. When examining the trends for trade intensity, there is a discrepancy between the land and buoy stations. In order to relate station observation results to synoptic scale changes, Reanalysis II data are used to analyze surface winds and sea level pressure (SLP) over the central and eastern north Pacific. An east-northeast <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> <b>winds</b> and an increase in SLP is found to occur from the 1980 s epoch to the 2000 s epoch. The analysis of land station surface pressure confirms the increase in SLP in the reanalysis data set...|$|R
60|$|But {{these little}} {{variations}} were trifles {{as compared with}} the advantage that the admiral obtained over the fears of his followers by the <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wind,</b> and the liberation from the weeds. By the first, the men saw a proof that the breezes did not always blow from the same quarter; and by the last, they ascertained that they had not actually reached a point where the ocean had become impassable. Although the wind was now favorable to return to the Canaries, no one any longer demanded that such a course should be adopted, so apt are we all to desire that which appears to be denied to us, and so ready to despise that which lies perfectly at our disposal.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{knowledge}} of offshore and coastal wave climate evolution {{towards the end}} of the twenty-first century is particularly important for human activities in a region such as the Bay of Biscay and the French Atlantic coast. Using dynamical downscaling, a high spatial resolution dataset of wave conditions in the Bay of Biscay is built for three future greenhouse gases emission scenarios. Projected wave heights, periods and directions are analysed at regional scale and more thoroughly at two buoys positions, offshore and along the coast. A general decrease of wave heights is identified (up to - 20 cm during summer within the Bay of Biscay), as well as a clockwise <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> summer waves and winter swell coming from direction. The relation between those changes and wind changes is investigated and highlights a complex association of processes at several spatial scales. For instance, the intensification and the north-eastward <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> strong <b>wind</b> core in the North Atlantic Ocean explain the clockwise <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> winter swell directions. During summer, the decrease <b>of</b> the westerly <b>winds</b> in the Bay of Biscay explains the clockwise shift and the wave height decrease <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> sea and intermediate waves. Finally, the analysis reveals that the offshore changes in the wave height and the wave period as well as the clockwise shift in the wave direction continue toward the coast. This wave height decrease result is consistent with other regional projections and would impact the coastal dynamics by reducing the longshore sediment flux...|$|R

50|$|If the {{stator winding}} is {{connected}} to the primary phase, the total voltage seen from the neutral (N) will be the sum of the voltages at both windings rotor and stator. Translating this to electric phasors, both phasors are connected. However, there is an angular <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> α between them. Since α can be freely chosen between π, both phasors can be added or subtracted, so all the values in between are attainable. The primary and secondary are not isolated. Also, the ratio of the magnitudes of voltages between rotor and stator is constant; the resultant voltage varies owing to the angular <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> the series <b>winding</b> induced voltage.|$|R
