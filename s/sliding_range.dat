40|$|SUMMARY. The {{undesired}} whirl of rotating machines can {{be reduced}} by elastic journal box suspension systems equipped with dry friction dampers. The critical speeds can be cut off by the adhesion of the friction surfaces and the whirl amplitude can be restrained throughout the remaining <b>sliding</b> <b>range</b> by a proper choice of the suspension-to-shaft stiffness ratio and of the support-to-rotor mass ratio. The dry friction forces counteract also efficiently the well known destabilising effect of the shaft hysteresis in the supercritical range. This lecture deals firstly with the natural precession speeds, investigates the steady response to unbalance and defines the ranges of adhesive or sliding contact. Then, the stabilisation “in the small” of the hysteretic whirl by means of other external dissipative sources is studied applying the Floquet approach through a perturbation procedure, while the stability “in the large” is checked by the direct numerical solution of the motion equation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{statistical}} method for 1 - 6 hour-ahead prediction of hourly {{mean wind speed}} and direction to better forecast the power produced by wind turbines, an increasingly important component of power system operation.

This is a generalisation of regime-switching type approaches which train separate predictors for a few fixed regimes. The new predictor is tested on the Hydra dataset of wind across the Netherlands and compared to persistence and a cyclo-stationary Wiener filter, a state-of-the-art spatial predictor of wind speed and direction.

40|$|The lac {{repressor}} {{associates with}} its operator {{at a rate}} faster than conventional diffusion allows, either because of one-dimensional diffusion of a captured repressor along the DNA (sliding) or because the tetrameric repressor can be rapidly transferred between DNA sites distant {{from each other in}} the primary sequence (direct transfer). We report measurements of relative repressor-operator association rates at physiological operator concentrations. We assay for the ability of DNA targets of equal length (approximately 200 base pairs) containing one or six operator segments to compete for repressor; as the <b>sliding</b> <b>range</b> decreases, the hexameric operator fragment should react up to six times faster than the monomeric operator fragment. We find that the advantage enjoyed by the hexameric fragment varies from little to none at low operator concentration (depending on ionic strength) to more than 3 -fold at high concentration. We ascribe this behavior to sliding at low operator concentration and to an increasing contribution of bimolecular direct transfer events as concentration increases. The observations require a "semibound" intermediate state of the protein at operator sites. This species can either undergo a relatively slow (tau greater than 1 sec) unimolecular isomerization to the final complex, or the isomerization can occur in a bridged complex with another operator site, accompanied by transfer to the second operator with probability of 0. 5.

40|$|Abstract A new {{technique}} for the rotor whirl damping in rotating machinery, {{based on the}} elastic suspension of the journal boxes {{and the use of}} dry friction surfaces normal to the shaft axis between their supports and the frame, is here analysed theoretically for several cases of rotor systems characterized by mass and constraint asymmetry, where gyroscopic effects are to be expected and conical whirl motions may grow up. The critical flexural speeds can be easily cut off by an adhesive state of the supports and the whirl amplitude can be minimized as well throughout the remaining <b>sliding</b> <b>range.</b> Confining the operative angular speed of the rotor in the range of adhesive contact between the dry friction surfaces, no significant increase of power dissipation or heat production has to be ascribed as a whole to this type of suspension system, whose task is just to suppress the resonant peaks when passing the critical speeds. On the other hand, the rubbing surface wear can be easily compensated in the long run by use of suitable spring devices to close the friction contact. The uniqueness and the stability of the steady motion are proved, both in the absence and in the presence of possible additional viscous sources of dissipation. It is also shown how the destabilizing influence of the shaft material hysteresis can be counterbalanced by the other external dissipative forces. r 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Essentially all the {{biological}} functions of DNA depend on site-specific DNA-binding proteins finding their targets, and therefore `searching' through megabases of non-target DNA. In this article, we review current {{understanding of how}} this sequence searching is done. We review how simple diffusion through solution {{may be unable to}} account for the rapid rates of association observed in experiments on some model systems, primarily the Lac repressor. We then present a simplified version of the `facilitated diffusion' model of Berg, Winter and von Hippel, showing how non-specific DNA-protein interactions may account for accelerated targeting, by permitting the protein to sample many binding sites per DNA encounter. We discuss the 1 -dimensional `sliding' motion of protein along non-specific DNA, often proposed to be the mechanism of this multiple site sampling, and we discuss the role of short-range diffusive `hopping' motions. We then derive the optimal range of sliding for a few physical situations, including simple models of chromosomes in vivo, showing that a <b>sliding</b> <b>range</b> of ~ 100 bp before dissociation optimizes targeting in vivo. Going beyond first-order binding kinetics, we discuss how processivity, the interaction of a protein with two or more targets on the same DNA, can reveal the extent of sliding and we review recent experiments studying processivity using the restriction enzyme EcoRV.

40|$|Friction {{is one of}} the key {{phenomena}} {{during the}} interaction of ice with offshore structures and ships, ice rafting and ridging processes, and the brittle compressive failure of ice. Therefore, knowledge of the ice friction laws and a better understanding of this phenomenon are needed for the design of safe and reliable offshore structures and successful operations in ice-infested waters. This thesis presents experimental studies on ice friction in the field and in the laboratory and can be divided into three parts: field study of ice friction and the effects of different parameters on the kinetic and static friction coefficients; investigation of geometrical stick-slip interaction between ice and stainless steel in small-scale laboratory tests; field investigation of the vertical ice forces exerted on isolated vertical piles frozen in a level sea due to changes in the water level. The first version of the experimental setup for the field tests to study ice friction was relatively simple and was used only in 2010. Significant modifications and improvements were made to the setup in 2011 that allowed us to better control the test conditions (i. e., velocity, normal load). The available range of sliding velocities (between 6 mm s - 1 and 43 mm s - 1) did not cover the whole range of our interest. Therefore, a new pulling mechanism was introduced in the tests in 2012 that allowed us to extend the <b>sliding</b> <b>range</b> up to 110 mm s- 1. The field experiments were conducted with first year sea ice in the Barents Sea and in fjords at Spitsbergen during three springs (2010 - 2012). In September of 2012, the ice friction tests were performed with multiyear sea ice northeast of Greenland. Most of the tests were performed to investigate the friction between sea ice and sea ice, while the rest were to study the friction between sea ice and corroded steel. The aim of the study was to survey the most important factors that affect ice friction in field conditions and to determine whether the existing friction models correctly predict the dependences observed in the field tests. The effects of the sliding velocity (6 mm s - 1 to 105 mm s - 1), air temperatures (- 2 °C to - 20 °C), normal load (300 N to 2000 N), presence of sea water in the interface, and ice grain orientation with respect to the sliding direction on the friction coefficient were investigated. The effect of the hold time on the static friction coefficient was also studied. The test campaigns showed that ice surface roughness is likely to be the most important parameter in determining the friction coefficient. Repeated sliding over the same track led to surface polishing and decreased the kinetic friction coefficient from 0. 48 to 0. 05. When sliding occurs between unsmoothed surfaces, the friction coefficient was found to be independent of the sliding velocity. As the contacting surfaces become smoother, the kinetic friction coefficient begins to depend on the velocity, as predicted by existing ice friction models. Some attempts were made to characterise ice surface irregularities and real contact area using two techniques: 1) the production of an ice surface cast and its further analysis using an optical microscope and 2) measurements of the pressure distribution and real contact area using tactile sensors. The static friction coefficient increases logarithmically with the hold time and changes from approximately 0. 6 at 5 s to 1. 26 at 960 s. The small-scale laboratory studies on the stick-slip interaction between ice and stainless steel were performed at the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS). A specially designed device allowed us to study the effect of well controlled steel surface roughness on the interaction between ice and steel under various test conditions. The effects of the relative sliding rate (1. 67 × 10 - 6 m s - 1 to 0. 83 × 10 - 3 m s - 1), temperature (- 5 °C to - 25 °C) and applied constant pushing force were also investigated. Stick-slip interaction was always observed in the tests on samples with an arithmetic average roughness (Ra) between 2 μm and 15 μm. Both steady state sliding and stick-slip were observed in the tests on samples with the lowest (Ra = 2 μm) and the highest (Ra = 25. 2 μm) roughness. The slip distance was found to be equal to the mean pitch profile (mean profile wavelength) for all velocities studied. The elasticity of the ice was found to be an important factor in the stick-slip interaction. The field studies of the vertical ice forces exerted on isolated vertical piles frozen in the ice were performed in Svea, Spitsbergen, in March of 2010. Four different piles made of steel and aluminium were used in the experiments. The piles were pushed through the ice using a hydraulic jack. The first peak load measured in the tests is associated with the onset of the ice-pile relative movement. Because we always observed failure at or very near the ice-pile interface, the first peak load can be treated as the strength of adhesion or the cohesive failure of ice in the vicinity of the interface. Elastic plate theory was used to estimate theoretically the vertical forces exerted on a pile. PhD i bygg, anlegg og transportPhD in Civil and Transport Engineerin...|$|E

Many prominent landslides appear to be of similar age and were emplaced after a major faulting that dropped the trough floors. Most sliding occurred after the created scarps were dissected into spurs, gullies, and tributary canyons. Emplacement of the landslides approximately coincided with a late episode of major eruptive activity of the Tharsis volcanoes, and it is suggested that the slides may have originated as gigantic mudflows with slump blocks at their heads. The large size of many landslides is due to the fault scarps as high as 7 km on which they formed in the absence of vigorous fluvial erosion.

Finally, these two processes are fused to detect landslide prone changes. The results demonstrate that 53 out of 80 inventory mapped landslides were identified using this method.
