It is destined to hang round the neck of Mrs. Richard Burton. As <b>somebody</b> <b>said</b> {{it would have been nice}} to wear in the tumbril on the way to the guillotine.... In this Age of Vulgarity marked by such minor matters as war and poverty, it gets harder {{everyday}} to scale the heights of true vulgarity. But given some loose millions, it can be done-and worse, admired".|$|E
500|$|The band's name, {{according}} to Erna's statement in a 1999 interview, [...] "I was {{making fun of}} somebody who had a cold sore on his lip {{and the next day}} I had one myself and <b>somebody</b> <b>said,</b> It looks like God smacked your face for making fun. The name stuck and they went by Godsmack from then on. We were aware of the Alice in Chains song but didn't really think much about it." [...] In 1996, Tony Rombola and Joe D'Arco joined Godsmack as the guitarist and drummer, after Richards left upon learning he had a six-year-old child and Stewart left due to personal differences. In the same year, the band entered the studio for the first time, recording its first CD titled All Wound Up. The CD was recorded in just three days for $2,600.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the suite has always been mixed, and all band members have expressed negativity toward it in recent times. Gilmour has said the album was [...] "a load of rubbish. We were at a real down point ... I think we were scraping the barrel a bit at that period" [...] and [...] "a good idea but it was dreadful... Atom Heart Mother sounds like we didn't have any idea between us, but we became much more prolific after it." [...] Similarly, in a 1984 interview on BBC Radio 1, Waters said [...] "If <b>somebody</b> <b>said</b> to me now – right – here's a million pounds, {{go out and play}} Atom Heart Mother, I'd say you must be fucking joking." [...] Alec Dubro of Rolling Stone gave Atom Heart Mother a negative review, ultimately stating [...] "if Pink Floyd is looking for some new dimensions, they haven't found them here." ...|$|E

500|$|Following Tahil's departure, plots were {{abandoned}} and many scripts {{had to be}} rewritten. EastEnders scriptwriter Tony Jordan revealed that it was intended that Dan would be murdered by his children after prolonged bullying and abuse, saying [...] "The family arrived in Albert Square in what {{was expected to be}} a huge storyline. The father [...] was an oppressive and violent bully – eventually his children were going to kill him. It was all scripted – how they buried him in a shallow grave, how they dealt with it, and how it all exploded. And then Dalip got bloody deported. He was actually on the studio floor and they marched him off. Broken legs, nervous breakdowns – we can deal with that. But when actors are physically taken away by the government and deported, there's not much you can do. Fifty scripts had to be reworked. And because all the episodes had been written around this big storyline, we had to keep the same amount of Ferreira material." [...] The murder storyline was replaced with one concerning a kidney transplant between Ronny and his newly discovered half brother Tariq. Jordan admitted they could have recast the character of Dan, but it may have looked [...] "tacky": [...] "We couldn't go, 'Tonight, the part of Mr Ferreira will be played by Michael French with a suntan'. We were trying to do it with integrity. Then <b>somebody</b> <b>said,</b> 'What if Ronnie Ferreira's mate Tariq turns out to be his half-brother and we do the whole kidney transplant thing?' And, of course, it was like watching paint dry. 'Can I have your kidney?' 'No. Oh, go on then...'" [...] Jordan told the Daily Mirror the Ferreiras were [...] "the least successful characters I created – through no fault of their own." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{makes my}} blood boil to read {{of the way}} which Mr. Zinoviev is {{speaking}} of the Prime Minister today. Though one time there went up a cry, [...] "Hands off Russia", I think it's time <b>somebody</b> <b>said</b> to Russia, [...] "Hands off England".|$|E
2500|$|Other {{aspects of}} the [...] "Southern Strategy" [...] {{included}} personal smears. As one-time House Majority Leader Richard Armey explained on Hard Ball with Chris Mathews: [...] "Well, it's pretty standard fare in political discourse. You misconstrue what <b>somebody</b> <b>said.</b> You isolate a statement; you lend your interpretation to it and then feign moral outrage".|$|E

2500|$|According to Davidson, when he {{completed}} the film, three different studios wanted to distribute it, {{and he went}} with Embassy Pictures because they offered him the most money. However, they had no prior experience in distribution and were unable to properly release it in theaters. Davidson remembered, [...] "And six months later, <b>somebody</b> <b>said,</b> 'Your picture is appearing on HBO this weekend,' and I didn't even know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Miami intercepted 5 of Phipps' {{passes and}} amassed 198 rushing yards. [...] Neither team's quarterback had much success. [...] Phipps {{completed}} just 9 of 23 passes for 131 yards and one touchdown, while Morrall completed only 6/13 passes for 88 yards. [...] Scott was the Browns top performer with 94 rushing yards and 4 receptions for 30. [...] “The {{best thing for}} us was to get behind,” said Miami fullback Larry Csonka after the game. “It got very quiet and <b>somebody</b> <b>said</b> ‘If we’re gonna get anything done, now’s {{the time to do}} it’. It got done.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Plimpton {{appeared}} in the 2008 Entertainment Weekly photo issue spread as one of [...] "The Hardest Working Actors In Showbiz". She appears in the spread with Lance Reddick, Celia Weston, John Slattery, Bobby Cannavale, James Rebhorn, Lynn Cohen, Matt Servitto and Bob Balaban. Plimpton said in the write-up, [...] "I went to jury duty the other day, and <b>somebody</b> <b>said,</b> 'You always play drug addicts!' I've played a few on TV, and I imagine because the shows get replayed, it seems like more. But yeah, people tend to see me as this pregnant teenage heroin addict." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first {{secretary}} of state to visit countries such as Togo and East Timor, Clinton believed that in-person visits were more important than ever in the digital age. As she said in remarks shortly before leaving office, [...] "I have found it highly ironic that, in today's world, when we can be anywhere virtually, more than ever people want us to show up, actually. <b>Somebody</b> <b>said</b> to me the other day, 'I look at your travel schedule. Why Togo? Why the Cook Islands?' No {{secretary of state}} had ever been to Togo before. Togo happens to be on the U.N. Security Council. Going there, making the personal investment, has a real strategic purpose." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nimoy {{said he had}} {{returned}} to the role because of the script and the enthusiasm shown by Abrams alongside Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman explaining what they wanted from the script and the Spock character. He added, [...] "I had felt marginalized for a long time. I hadn't been asked to be involved with Star Trek for something like 17 or 18 years. And this felt like <b>somebody</b> <b>said,</b> 'There's a value to you, that we'd like to take advantage of and do something with.' And it felt good. It felt good. It felt like being, frankly, appreciated. I was happy to go back to work." [...] Nimoy subsequently befriended Quinto. Although Quinto watched some episodes of The Original Series during breaks in filming, he said Nimoy was his main resource in playing Spock.|$|E
2500|$|On October 3, 2017, Thune {{became the}} center of media {{attention}} for his response to the mass murder in Las Vegas. [...] "It sounds like [...] used conversion kits and other things, you know, to make the weapons more lethal," [...] Thune said. [...] "We’ll look at the facts when we get them all in here. I think a lot of us want {{to do everything we can}} to prevent tragedies like that from happening again. You know - it's an open society. And when somebody does what he wants to do - it's going to be hard to prevent anything. But I think people are going to have to take steps in their own lives to take precautions. To protect themselves. And in situations like that, you know, try to stay safe. As <b>somebody</b> <b>said</b> — get small.” ...|$|E

5000|$|It is {{reported}} that Mbay {{does not have}} independent personal pronouns. The meaning is largely carried out by subject, object, and possessive affixes attached to verbs, prepositions, and nouns. Other words, such as yá̰a̰ [...] "thing", dèē [...] "person", tàa [...] "speech", and lòo [...] "place" [...] are used somewhat pronominally as something, <b>somebody,</b> something <b>said,</b> and somewhere.|$|R
