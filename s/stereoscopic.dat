5|$|In November 2010, a <b>stereoscopic</b> 3D {{version was}} {{announced}} {{adding a new}} opening sequence. The 3D version was released in Tokyo's Shinjuku Wald 9 theater on March 26, 2011. The <b>stereoscopic</b> 3D version was released in both normal and deluxe edition on July 22, 2011. The normal version contains opening-day greetings by the staff and cast, film advertisements, and audio commentaries. The deluxe edition titled Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Solid State Society -Another Dimension- is packaged in a Dennōka Box containing the film in <b>Stereoscopic</b> 3D all the content the normal edition along with three Tachikomatic Days shorts in 3D and one in 2D.|$|E
5|$|Both Ænima and 10,000 Days were {{nominated}} for the Grammy Award for Best Recording Package, but while the former failed to win in 1997, the latter did win in 2007. Jones created packaging for 10,000 Days that features a pair of <b>stereoscopic</b> lenses for viewing 3-D artwork and photos. Jones, a lifelong fan of <b>stereoscopic</b> photography, wanted the packaging to be unique and to reflect the 1970s artwork he appreciates.|$|E
5|$|In October 2010 TriOviz for Games Technology {{has been}} {{integrated}} in Unreal Engine 3, allowing to easily convert in <b>stereoscopic</b> 3D, numerous past and upcoming games developed with this engine.|$|E
5|$|All GameCube {{systems support}} {{the display of}} <b>stereoscopic</b> 3D, and Luigi's Mansion was {{developed}} to utilize this feature. However, 3D televisions were not widespread at the time, and it was deemed that compatible displays would be too cost-prohibitive for the consumer. As a result, the feature was never enabled outside of development.|$|E
5|$|Panavision 3D was {{a system}} for {{presenting}} 3-D film in a digital cinema. It was a passive <b>stereoscopic</b> 3D system that utilized spectral comb filters produced using thin-film optics technology. In such systems, the visible spectrum is broken into alternate bands of light that evenly span the entire visible spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{also have}} access to EVEREST (Exploratory Visualization Environment for Research and Technology) to better {{understand}} the data that Titan outputs. EVEREST is a visualization room with a 10 by 3 meter (33 by 10 ft) screen and a smaller, secondary screen. The screens are 37 and 33 megapixels respectively with <b>stereoscopic</b> 3D capability.|$|E
5|$|The Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) {{mission was}} {{launched}} in October 2006. Two identical spacecraft were launched into orbits that cause them to (respectively) pull further ahead of and fall gradually behind Earth. This enables <b>stereoscopic</b> imaging of the Sun and solar phenomena, such as coronal mass ejections.|$|E
5|$|The film, {{which had}} a {{production}} budget of 350 million yen, debuted in Japan on SKY PerfecTV! on September 1, 2006, and it was released in North America in 2007. A <b>stereoscopic</b> 3D version of the film was released in 2011. The film received generally positive reviews, but was criticized for being dialogue-heavy and lacking in action.|$|E
5|$|A 3D Classics {{remake of}} Kid Icarus was {{published}} for the Nintendo 3DS handheld console. The remake features <b>stereoscopic</b> 3D along with updated graphics including backgrounds, which the original lacked. It also {{uses the same}} save system as the Family Computer Disk System version does, {{as opposed to the}} Password system from the NES version. The 3D Classics version also utilizes the Family Computer Disk System's music and sound effects (utilizing the extra sound channel not available in the NES version).|$|E
5|$|A Nintendo 3DS {{version of}} the game, titled 3D Sonic the Hedgehog, was {{released}} {{as part of the}} 3D Classics line in 2013. This version, unlike most downloadable re-releases of the game, is not emulated; rather, the game's code was restructured to allow it {{to take advantage of the}} 3DS system's <b>stereoscopic</b> 3D graphics and comes with additional enhancements, such as the option to use the Spin Dash move, a CRT-style filter, and the option to start the game from any level.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong Country Returns is a side-scrolling {{platformer}} {{video game}} developed by Retro Studios {{and published by}} Nintendo for the Wii console. The game was released first in North America in November 2010, and in PAL regions and Japan the following month. A <b>stereoscopic</b> port of the game, titled Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in May 2013, and in Japan the following month.|$|E
5|$|God of War: Origins Collection {{features}} native 1080p high-definition video, anti-aliased graphics at 60 frames per second, DualShock 3 rumble features, Trophies, and is {{the only}} God of War release to feature <b>Stereoscopic</b> 3D. The God of War–Game Directors Live documentary, Kratos Legionnaire bonus skin, and Forest of the Forgotten combat arena (originally pre-order bonuses for Ghost of Sparta) are also included with the Origins Collection.|$|E
5|$|On 28 September 2011, Rockstar {{announced}} the PC {{version of the}} game, subtitled The Complete Edition, which was released on 8 November 2011 in North America and 11 November 2011 in Australia and Europe. It contained all downloadable content from the original versions. Enhancements include keyboard remapping and gamepad functionality, increased fidelity, graphical enhancements, and <b>stereoscopic</b> 3D support. The Complete Edition was made available for consoles shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|On December 22, 2011, {{following}} {{the success of}} Tangled, Disney announced a new title for the film, Frozen, and a release date of November 27, 2013. A month later, {{it was confirmed that}} the film would be a computer-animated feature in <b>stereoscopic</b> 3D, instead of the originally intended hand-drawn animation. Anderson-Lopez and Lopez joined the project and started writing songs for Frozen in January 2012. On March 5, 2012, it was announced that Buck would be directing, with Lasseter and Peter Del Vecho producing.|$|E
5|$|On November 5, 2014, Nintendo {{announced}} in its Nintendo Direct presentation that The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D {{would be released}} for the Nintendo 3DS in the Northern Hemisphere in spring 2015. Like Ocarina of Time 3D, the remake features improved character models and <b>stereoscopic</b> 3D graphics, along with altered boss battles and an additional fishing minigame. A special edition featuring a pin badge, double-sided poster, and steelbook, was released in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Stafford Leak Warren (July 19, 1896 - July 26, 1981) was an American {{physician}} and radiologist {{who was a}} pioneer in the field of nuclear medicine and best known for his invention of the mammogram. Warren developed the technique of producing <b>stereoscopic</b> images of the breast with X-rays while working in the Department of Radiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} the nasal {{chambers}} of Ankylosaurus indicate that airflow was unidirectional, (looping through the lungs during inhalation and exhalation), although it {{may also have been}} bidirectional in the posterior nasal chamber, which directed air past the olfactory lobes. The enlarged olfactory region of ankylosaurids indicates a well-developed sense of smell, and the position of the orbits of Ankylosaurus suggest some <b>stereoscopic</b> vision.|$|E
5|$|At Sony's 2012 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) press conference, the North American {{release date}} was {{confirmed}} as March 12, 2013. A single-player demo was shown, revealing new gameplay mechanics and combat systems. An {{encounter with the}} sea monster Charybdis {{was included in the}} demo, but this sequence was cut from the final game. Charybdis was recast as the creature that Alecto transforms into during the final fight of the game. The same day, Papy confirmed on PlayStation.Blog that a collector's edition of the game would be released. He said Ascension was being developed to feature <b>stereoscopic</b> 3D, but it was ultimately cut. At gamescom 2012, new multiplayer footage was shown, followed by the announcement of a multiplayer beta.|$|E
5|$|At metamorphosis, {{rapid changes}} in the body take place as the {{lifestyle}} of the frog changes completely. The spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut. The animal develops a large jaw, and its gills disappear along with its gill sac. Eyes and legs grow quickly, and a tongue is formed. There are associated {{changes in the}} neural networks such as development of <b>stereoscopic</b> vision and loss of the lateral line system. All this can happen in about a day. A few days later, the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place.|$|E
5|$|Fantasia, an {{experimental}} film produced to an accompanying orchestral arrangement conducted by Leopold Stokowski, {{was released in}} November 1940 by Disney itself {{in a series of}} limited-seating roadshow engagements. The film cost $2 million to produce, and although the film earned $1.4 million in its roadshow engagements, the high cost ($85,000 per theater) of installing Fantasound placed Fantasia at an even greater loss than Pinocchio. RKO assumed distribution of Fantasia in 1941, later reissuing it in severely edited versions over the years. Despite its financial failure, Fantasia was the subject of two Academy Honorary Awards on February 26, 1942– one {{for the development of the}} innovative Fantasound system used to create the film's <b>stereoscopic</b> soundtrack, and the other for Stokowski and his contributions to the film.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 and 2004, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{carried out}} two expeditions to Titanic. The first, carried out between 22 June and 2 July 2003, {{performed}} four dives in two days. Its key aims were {{to assess the}} current condition of the wreck site and carry out scientific observations to support ongoing research. The stern section, which had previously received relatively little attention from explorers, was specifically targeted for analysis. The microbial colonies aboard Titanic were also a key focus of investigation. The second expedition, from 27 May– 12 June 2004, saw the return of Robert Ballard to Titanic nearly 20 years after he discovered it. The expedition spent 11 days on the wreck, carrying out high-resolution mapping using video and <b>stereoscopic</b> still images.|$|E
5|$|In a video {{posted on}} July 21, 2009, YouTube {{software}} engineer Peter Bradshaw announced that YouTube users can now upload 3D videos. The videos {{can be viewed}} in several different ways, including the common anaglyph (cyan/red lens) method which utilizes glasses worn by the viewer to achieve the 3D effect. The YouTube Flash player can display <b>stereoscopic</b> content interleaved in rows, columns or a checkerboard pattern, side-by-side or anaglyph using a red/cyan, green/magenta or blue/yellow combination. In May 2011, an HTML5 version of the YouTube player began supporting side-by-side 3D footage that is compatible with Nvidia 3D Vision.|$|E
5|$|In late 2009, Polytron {{presented}} an iPhone game called Power Pill at Pecha Kucha Montreal. The game features a panacean pill that travels through human bodies as its playable protagonist, and {{it uses the}} iPhone's multi-touch screen. GameSetWatch Eric Caoili compared it to Soul Bubbles and Irritating Stick. The game was developed with Alec Holowka of Infinite Ammo, and a level editor {{was expected to be}} included. While working on Fez, Fish revived a game project called SuperHyperCube, which was based on Wiimote motion capture input and <b>stereoscopic</b> navigation. Fish felt the game would work better with the new Kinect motion tracking. The adapted game was a finalist at Indiecade 2011.|$|E
5|$|Jack Bros. was {{developed}} and published by Atlus for the Virtual Boy, and was released on September 29, 1995 in Japan, and somewhere between late October and November 1995 in North America. According to Nintendo Power, Atlus did not reveal any details about the game's development, although {{it is known that}} it initially was planned to be titled Devil Busters. It is a spin-off from Atlus' Megami Tensei series, and the first entry to be released outside Japan. Being a Virtual Boy title, it made use of the system's <b>stereoscopic</b> 3D to display conventional 2D graphics in monochrome red and black visuals, and a graphics technique called parallax scrolling, to create a 3D effect.|$|E
5|$|Like all primates, strepsirrhine orbits (eye sockets) have a postorbital bar, a {{protective}} ring of bone {{created by a}} connection between the frontal and zygomatic bones. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines lack a thin wall of bone behind the eye, referred to as postorbital closure, which is only seen in haplorhine primates. Although the eyes of strepsirrhines point forward, giving <b>stereoscopic</b> vision, the orbits do not face fully forward. Among living strepsirrhines, most or all species are thought to possess a reflective layer behind the retina of the eye, called a tapetum lucidum (consisting of riboflavin crystals), which improves vision in low light, but they lack a fovea, which improves day vision. This differs from tarsiers, which lack a tapetum lucidum but possess a fovea.|$|E
5|$|M87 is a {{very strong}} source of gamma rays, which are the most {{energetic}} rays of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays coming from M87 have been observed since the late 1990s, but in 2006, using the High Energy <b>Stereoscopic</b> System Cherenkov telescopes, scientists have measured the variations of the gamma ray flux coming from M87, and found that the flux changes over a matter of days. This short period makes the immediate vicinity of the supermassive black hole in M87 the most promising source for these gamma rays. In general, the smaller the diameter of the emission source, the faster the variation in flux, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus. The eye sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. Horner {{also pointed out that}} the tyrannosaur lineage had a history of steadily improving binocular vision. It is not obvious why natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that <b>stereoscopic</b> vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators.|$|E
5|$|Stratton {{continued}} his experiments on perception, branching into studies on pseudoscopic vision, <b>stereoscopic</b> acuity, eye movements, symmetry and visual illusions, how people perceive depth seeing surroundings either one-eyed or two-eyed, acuity {{and limits of}} peripheral vision, apparent motion, afterimages impressed on the eye when a person stares at an object for long and then looks away, and problems with sight in half the visual field (hemianopsia). He both reviewed earlier studies on motion and conducted two of his own, concluding perceiving movement {{was more than the}} sum of seeing successive sequential images. He also surveyed and reported in reviews in the Psychological Bulletin experiments at various labs, including those in Europe, on matters related to sensation and perception.|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 {{versions}} of Arkham City include a <b>stereoscopic</b> 3D (S3D) mode for 3D HDTVs and for 2D HDTVs via Inficolor 3D glasses, while the PC version supports Nvidia 3D Vision on compatible monitors. It uses TriOviz for Games Technology, which is integrated with Unreal Engine 3. The Wii U version uses the Wii U's touch screen controller {{to let the}} player manage Batman's equipment and upgrades, selectively detonate Explosive Gel placements, and view {{a map of the}} city. The Wii U version adds a Sonar mode which highlights points of interest nearby, and the Battle Armored Tech Mode (BAT Mode) that allows Batman to accrue energy during combat and, when activated, inflict increased damage.|$|E
5|$|After the {{different}} {{components of a}} scene were finished, the team at Bones created its layout art; this included things such as determining the camera position throughout the scene and how movements would be done. The developers wanted to focus on how the characters' faces were drawn and animated, {{and make sure that}} the characters matched their respective in-game 3D models, so Fuse gave detailed feedback on the layouts, and drew over them in red to indicate what he wanted to be changed. These changes included corrections to off-model drawings, facial expressions, body postures, and character acting. Once the layouts had been approved, the animators drew the key animation, after which the in-between frames were drawn. Once the animated footage was completed, it was put together and rendered in <b>stereoscopic</b> 3D. Voice acting, music, sound effects, sound leveling and remixing was then done, and added to the cutscene.|$|E
5|$|Delay issues aside, the {{development}} team encountered further {{challenges in the}} creation of the game. Implementing the top-down perspective became a particular issue and resulted in a lot of trial and error. With a true top-down view, players would be unable to see characters' faces and bodies. To circumvent this issue, objects in the world were tilted at an angle so that they were more visible in the top-down view. Mouri requested that the game run at sixty frames per second instead of thirty to stabilise the <b>stereoscopic</b> 3D and smoothen movement animations. While doubling the frame rate increased the processing load, it allowed the developers to implement a feature where players could select items by dragging and dropping them from their inventory using the Nintendo 3DS's touchscreen and stylus; at thirty frames per second this feature felt too sluggish for the stylus's movement.|$|E
5|$|Dual Destinies was {{the first}} game in the main series to be {{developed}} for the Nintendo 3DS; this move from the Nintendo DS to the Nintendo 3DS {{was the most difficult}} part of the development, with the development team being unsure of whether to use 2D graphics like with previous games or to use 3D models. Eventually they decided to use 3D graphics, because of the <b>stereoscopic</b> 3D effect being a selling point for the Nintendo 3DS system. Because of the move to 3D, the in-house artist Takuro Fuse was in charge of the art direction, rather than the series regular Tatsuro Iwamoto, so that they could have meetings about the art more often. This was Fuse's first work on the main series, so he initially had problems with making character designs that fit the series, and had to get a lot of feedback from Eshiro. According to Eshiro and Yamazaki, they put effort into the graphics, wanting to ensure that Dual Destinies graphics looked better than those of Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Hudson Soft {{made two}} {{different}} games based on Mario Bros. The first was , {{which was a}} re-imagining of the original Mario Bros. with new phases, mechanics and gameplay. The second was , which featured a new gameplay mechanic involving punching small balls to stun enemies. Both games were released for the PC-8801, FM-7, and X1 and {{have been described as}} average for the most part, neither the best or worst games in the series. Mario Clash, a game released in 1995 for the Virtual Boy, was developed as a straight remake of Mario Bros., with the working title Mario Bros. VB. It was the first <b>stereoscopic</b> 3D Mario game. The objective of the game is to knock all the enemies in a particular phase off ledges. Instead of hitting them from below, like in Mario Bros., the player must hit enemies using Koopa shells.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{hardware}} units under Iwata's tenure, {{including the}} Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, {{were not as}} successful as the DS and Wii, and Nintendo's finances took a downward turn starting in 2010. During the development phase of the 3DS, a handheld device featuring <b>stereoscopic</b> 3D without the need of accessories, Iwata stated that his background in technology helped keep Nintendo's engineers in line. It was hoped that the successor to the Nintendo DS would reinvigorate the company after profits began declining. However, weak sales upon {{the release of the}} Nintendo 3DS caused the company's stock to fall by 12percent on July29, 2011. The console's poor sales prompted a price cut in August from its launch price of US$250 to US$170. Sales of the 3DS continually fell below expectations. Iwata later admitted in 2014 that he misread the market and did not appropriately account for changing lifestyles since the launch of the Wii. He continually placed focus on family-oriented games despite declining popularity.|$|E
5|$|The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man was {{primarily}} developed by Universal Creative, {{the research and}} development division of Universal Parks & Resorts. Scott Trowbridge, who now works for Walt Disney Imagineering, was the ride's producer. Thierry Coup, who has since worked on Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey and , was the Director and production designer. Trowbridge and Coup helped develop the initial storyboards for the attraction. They travelled to Massachusetts several times to meet with the animation directors, Jeff Kleiser and Diana Walczak, and their team at Kleiser-Walczak Construction Co. (now Synthespian Studios) who provided all the <b>stereoscopic</b> animation and custom software for squinching. Coup produced the film alongside Patrick Mooney and Mark Rhodes. Trowbridge is given writing credits alongside Ross Osterman and Scott Peterson. Peter Lehman provided the soundtrack with Soundelux.|$|E
