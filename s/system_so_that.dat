5|$|Temperatures Rising {{returned}} to the ABC network on July 18, 1974 after a six-month hiatus. Its new time slot, Thursday nights at 8:00 PM, had previously been occupied by Chopper One, an adventure series. The situations presented this time around included Dr. Mercy saving {{the life of a}} popular country music singer (Dick Gautier), and setting up a surveillance <b>system</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> staff would be kept on their toes.|$|E
5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock Braking System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the braking <b>system</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E
5|$|The wine gallon was {{abolished}} in Britain in 1826, {{and this}} system {{was replaced by}} a new one based on the newly introduced imperial gallon. Since the imperial gallon is 20% more than the liquid gallon, {{the same is true for}} the imperial pint in relation to the liquid pint. This explains why the number of fluid ounces per gallon had to be adjusted in the new <b>system</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the fluid ounce was not changed too much by the reform. Even so, the modern UK fluid ounce is 4% less than the US fluid ounce, and the same is true for the smaller units. For some years both systems were used concurrently in the UK.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{operating}} systems, Plan 9 {{does not provide}} special application programming interfaces (such as Berkeley sockets, X resources or ioctl system calls) to access devices. Instead, Plan 9 device drivers implement their control interface as a file <b>system,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the hardware can be accessed by the ordinary file input/output operations read and write. Consequently, sharing the device across the network {{can be accomplished by}} mounting the corresponding directory tree to the target machine.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{even before}} the {{increase}} of abuse of the Case Stated procedure, the United Kingdom {{was estimated to be}} losing £500 million a year through the movement of arbitration business to other countries. In response, the Lord Chancellor convened a Commercial Court Users Conference in 1960, and tasked them with reviewing the system; the conclusion was that the status quo should remain. With the increased use of the Case Stated procedure, more calls for reform came. In June 1977 the London Arbitration Group (LAG) was formed, taking it upon itself to make the government aware of the damage current law was causing. In 1978, in reaction to the continued pressure, the Lord Chancellor established a Commercial Court Committee to again look at the issue; their report, in June 1978, recommended changing the <b>system</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> appeal was only allowed when either the High Court permitted it, or both parties to the arbitration agreed it was necessary. This was intended to ensure that any new Act of Parliament fulfilled two roles – firstly, decreasing the use of the Case Stated procedure, and secondly, encouraging arbitrators to give reasons for their decisions.|$|E
5|$|Each planet or moon has a mass, and {{therefore}} a gravitational pull, though they do not affect one another and only the single strongest pull affects the player's ship. This sometimes results in odd behavior; for example, the gravitational effect of Mars is much stronger than that of its moon Phobos. This means that a player attempting to land on Phobos needs to allow the ship to fall below the moon's surface until it is close enough to Phobos's center that Phobos's pull becomes the dominant force, {{at which point the}} ship snaps back to be landed on the surface. The name of the planet or moon with the current strongest pull is displayed on the screen. Players are able to edit the program to change the conditions; popular variations by the original players were increasing the gravity level and thus the difficulty, or an adjustment to the coordinate display <b>system</b> <b>so</b> <b>that,</b> rather than the ship staying {{in the center of the}} screen and the planets moving relative to it, the current dominant planet would always be at the bottom of the screen, with the ship moving relative to it.|$|E

5|$|In January 2009 the International Baseball Federation {{created a}} ranking <b>system</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the nations {{involved}} in international competition {{could be compared}} independently. Teams receive points based on the position they finish {{at the end of}} tournaments. The system takes into account results not only of the senior men's teams but also of junior teams. Weightings that emphasise the importance of certain tournaments are {{based on the number of}} teams competing, the number of continents represented (or eligible to be represented), and in the case of continental tournaments such as the Oceania Baseball Championship the relative strength of teams eligible. Only results within the previous four years are used, so points are added and removed over time. Since the system began, the rankings have been adjusted after the completion of tournaments qualifying for the ranking process; the most recent was the 2009 Baseball World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Sorath {{submitted}} Devil Daggers to Steam Greenlight, {{a community}} selection <b>system,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the game could {{be released on}} digital distribution platform Steam. The game was successfully greenlit and released for Windows on 18 February 2016. On 6 July 2016, Sorath released an OS X version of Devil Daggers. Alongside this release, two new enemy types {{were added to the}} game and the Devil Daggers soundtrack was added to the game's directory. Support for vertical sync, increased field of view, and virtual surround sound via HRTF-processing were also added. On 19 September 2016, a Linux version of Devil Daggers was released along with the ability to view replays from a top-down perspective. The update also added more statistics such as tracking a player's total survival time across all runs.|$|E
5|$|Several teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Red Bull introduced a revised version of its RB6 chassis for Vettel as his previous monocoque had a small defect which created handling difficulties in Monaco. The team tested a version of McLaren's F-duct system (which increases the top speed of a car) during the Friday practice sessions but removed it for qualifying and the race because both of McLaren's drivers found the device difficult to operate. Ferrari modified their F-duct <b>system</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it would allow their drivers to operate the system by using their left leg. Mercedes arrived at the circuit by reverting to a previous specification of suspension and introduced a longer wheelbase on both their cars as well as a new version of their F-duct system. Williams decided to revert to an old specification of their front wing following accidents involving their drivers in Monaco, though the team brought new brake ducts. Lotus débuted a new rear wing specification which improved forward balance of their chassis. Virgin managed to procure a longer-wheelbase version of the VR-01 for Lucas di Grassi after the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull prevented them from having two cars prepared in time for the previous race.|$|E
