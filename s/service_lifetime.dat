25|$|Early pinball {{machines}} typically had full solenoid current passing through trigger switches {{for all types}} of solenoids, from kickers to pop bumpers to the flippers themselves. This caused arcing across switch contacts and rapid contact fouling and failure. As electronics were gradually implemented in pinball design, solenoids began to be switched by power transistors under software control to lower switch voltage and current, vastly extend switch <b>service</b> <b>lifetime,</b> and add flexibility to game design.|$|E

Geopipe highlights this function, and also geonets, geocomposites and very thick geotextiles. Drainage applications for these different geosynthetics are retaining walls, sport fields, dams, canals, reservoirs, and capillary breaks. Also to be noted is that sheet, edge and wick drains are geocomposites used for various soil and rock drainage situations.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} <b>service</b> <b>lifetimes</b> {{for capital}} assets in Dutch manufacturing industries, using information on asset retirement patterns. A Weibull distribution function is estimated using a nonlinear regression technique to derive <b>service</b> <b>lifetimes</b> for three selected asset types: transport equipment, machinery and computers. For this purpose the benchmark capital stock surveys for different two digit industries {{are linked to}} annual discard surveys. On average the estimated lifetimes are respectively 6, 9 and 26 years for transport equipments, computers and machinery. However, these estimates vary across industries. A comparison of our estimates with Canadian, US and Japanese estimates shows notable differences in the lifetimes of all the asset types, with machinery showing the largest difference. ...|$|R

40|$|The DOE Solar Energy Technologies Program {{includes}} a sub-key activity entitled ''Photovoltaic Module Reliability R&D''. This activity {{has been in}} existence for several years to help ensure that the PV technologies that advance to the commercial module stage have acceptable <b>service</b> <b>lifetimes</b> and annual performance degradation rates. The long-term (2020) goal, {{as stated in the}} Solar Program Multi-Year Technical Plan [1], is to assist industry with the development of PV systems that have 30 -year <b>service</b> <b>lifetimes</b> and 1 % annual performance degradation rates. The corresponding module <b>service</b> <b>lifetimes</b> and annual performance degradation rate would have to be 30 years lifetime and approximately 0. 5 % (or less, {{depending on the type of}} PV system) annual performance degradation. Reaching this goal is critical to achieving the PV technology Levelized Energy Cost Targets, as listed and described in the Solar Program Multi-Year Technical Plan. This paper is an overview of the Module Reliability R&D sub-key activity. More details and the major results and accomplishments are covered in the papers presented in the PV Module Reliability Session of the DOE Solar Energy Technology Review Meeting, October 25 - 28, 2004, in Denver, Colorado...|$|R

40|$|The {{radiation}} resistance of polymeric and composite materials to space radiation is currently based on irradiating materials with Co- 60 gamma-radiation to the equivalent total ionizing dose (TID) expected during mission. This is an approximation since gamma-radiation is not truly {{representative of the}} particle species; namely, Solar Particle Event (SPE) protons and Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) nucleons, encountered in space. In general, the SPE and GCR particle energies are much higher than Co- 60 gamma-ray photons, and since the particles have mass, there is a displacement effect due to nuclear collisions between the particle species and the target material. This effort specifically bridges the gap between estimated <b>service</b> <b>lifetimes</b> based on decades old Co- 60 gamma-radiation data, and newer assessments of what the <b>service</b> <b>lifetimes</b> actually are based on irradiation with particle species that are more representative of the space radiation environment...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{time-dependent}} network of infinite-server queues {{to help a}} service provider manage a family of private-line telecommunication services. The queueing network is used to model switching from one service to another. The relevant time scale is quite long: <b>service</b> <b>lifetimes</b> are measured in years, while service life cycles are measured in decades. To capture changing technology and customer preferences over this extended period, the model includes time-dependent new-connection rates, time-dependent switching rates and general time-dependent service-lifetime distributions for the different services. Because of the long <b>service</b> <b>lifetimes,</b> there is typically a significant time lag behind the peak arrival rate in the peak expected number of customers receiving service. Thus sales and revenue do not move together; instead sales is a leading indicator of revenue in a service life cycle. The network structure reveals how the life cycles of different services are related. We show that i [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The salient {{question}} is not whether optical fiber will survive in the Super Conducting Supercollider (SSC) tunnel, but rather how long will it survive.

But conservatively speaking, current production optical fibers can probably not be depended upon for more than 25 years of service even under ideal conditions...|$|R
