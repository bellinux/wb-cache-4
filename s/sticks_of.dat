5|$|Fireworks: Fireworks first {{appeared}} in China during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), in the early age of gunpowder. The common people in the Song era could purchase simple fireworks from market vendors; these were made of <b>sticks</b> <b>of</b> bamboo packed with gunpowder, although grander displays {{were known to be}} held. Rocket propulsion was soon applied to warfare, and {{by the time of the}} mid 14th century there were many types of rocket launchers available.|$|E
5|$|Compton {{was one of}} {{a handful}} of {{scientists}} and philosophers to propose a two-stage model of free will. Others include William James, Henri Poincaré, Karl Popper, Henry Margenau, and Daniel Dennett. In 1931, Compton championed the idea of human freedom based on quantum indeterminacy, and invented the notion of amplification of microscopic quantum events to bring chance into the macroscopic world. In his somewhat bizarre mechanism, he imagined <b>sticks</b> <b>of</b> dynamite attached to his amplifier, anticipating the Schrödinger's cat paradox, which was published in 1935.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea {{created their}} first chance {{of the match}} after 18 minutes – a shot from Lampard which hit Kolo Touré. They fought back to equalise two minutes later. Ballack {{launched}} the ball to Drogba {{on the right-hand side}} of Arsenal’s penalty area. Diverting his markers who attempted to set the offside trap, Drogba took the ball and shot it past Manuel Almunia's goal to score. The equaliser led to Chelsea asserting themselves in the match as the team began to build up possession. Denílson, at the midway point of the half, received the game’s first yellow card for a foul on Essien; the Chelsea midfielder was later booked for a tackle on Baptista. <b>Sticks</b> <b>of</b> celery were thrown at Fàbregas before he took a corner close to stoppage time; targeting opponents with the vegetable was a Chelsea supporter’s ritual going back more than two decades and originated from song.|$|E

5|$|Several {{types of}} incense clock have been found, {{the most common}} forms include the incense stick and incense seal. An incense stick clock was an incense stick with calibrations; most were elaborate, {{sometimes}} having threads, with weights attached, at even intervals. The weights would drop onto a platter or gong below, signifying that {{a certain amount of}} time had elapsed. Some incense clocks were held in elegant trays; open-bottomed trays were also used, to allow the weights to be used together with the decorative tray. <b>Sticks</b> <b>of</b> incense with different scents were also used, so that the hours were marked by a change in fragrance. The incense sticks could be straight or spiraled; the spiraled ones were longer, and were therefore intended for long periods of use, and often hung from the roofs of homes and temples.|$|E

5|$|Zorin, who {{had escaped}} in his airship with Scarpine and Mortner, abducts Sutton, but Bond {{grabs hold of}} the airship's mooring rope. Zorin tries to knock Bond off the rope, but Bond manages to moor the airship to the {{framework}} of the Golden Gate Bridge. Sutton attacks Zorin, and in the fracas, Mortner and Scarpine are temporarily knocked out. Sutton flees and joins Bond out on the bridge, but Zorin pursues them with an axe. The ensuing fight between Zorin and Bond culminates with Zorin falling to his death in the waters of San Francisco Bay. An enraged Mortner attacks Bond using <b>sticks</b> <b>of</b> dynamite, but Bond cuts the airship cable free, which causes Mortner to drop the dynamite in the cabin. The dynamite explodes, killing Mortner and Scarpine and destroying the airship. General Gogol awards Bond the Order of Lenin for foiling Zorin's strategy. Afterwards, Bond and Sutton make love in the shower of the Sutton home.|$|E

They were sold simply as <b>sticks</b> <b>of</b> zoethout ('sweet wood') to chew on as as a candy. Through chewing and suckling, the intensely sweet flavour is released. The sweetness is 30 to 50 times as strong as sucrose, without causing damage to teeth. Roughly since the 1970's, zoethout has become rarer in favor of easier to consume candies (including 'drop').|$|E
