5000|$|The key raw {{material}} in stoneware is either naturally occurring <b>stoneware</b> <b>clay</b> or non-refractory fire clay. The mineral kaolinite is present but disordered, and although mica and quartz are present their particle size is very small. <b>Stoneware</b> <b>clay</b> is often accompanied by impurities such as iron or carbon, giving it a [...] "dirty" [...] look, and its plasticity can vary widely. Non-refractory fire clay may be another key {{raw material}}. Fire clays are generally considered refractory, because they withstand very high temperatures before melting or crumbling. Refractory fire clays have {{a high concentration of}} kaolinite, with lesser amounts of mica and quartz. Non-refractory fire clays, however, have larger amounts of mica and feldspar.|$|E

40|$|The general {{characteristics}} and technological properties of ceramic clays {{used in the}} Spanish ceramic cluster (Castellón province), have been investigated. Red clays for ceramic wall tiles and floor tiles are mainly extracted in the Valencian Community, in Villar del Arzobispo, La Yesa, Chulilla, Alcora (Más Vell) and San Juan de Moró, {{although there is a}} small proportion coming from Teruel province. An important group of clay raw materials used in the ceramic cluster of Castellón, in Spain, occurs in Permo-Triassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments. These clays are intended for applications in <b>stoneware.</b> <b>Clays</b> were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, chemical composition, particle size distribution, thermal analysis and plasticity.

5000|$|Stoneware is {{a rather}} broad term for pottery or other {{ceramics}} fired at a relatively high temperature. A modern technical definition is a vitreous or semi-vitreous ceramic made primarily from <b>stoneware</b> <b>clay</b> or non-refractory fire clay. [...] Whether vitrified or not, it is nonporous (does not soak up liquids); {{it may or may}} not be glazed. [...] Historically, across the world, it has usually been developed after earthenware and before porcelain, and has often been used for high-quality as well as utilitarian wares.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>stoneware</b> <b>clay</b> that Norstad Pottery mixed was a {{combination}} of Kentucky ball clay, California fire clay, and grog- a sand like material. When fired the pieces vitrified into an extremely hard, dense, non-porous material. The mixture was thrown into an old commercial dough mixer with water and the finished batch turned out into plaster trays to age and lose moisture. The clay was then driven through a pug mill, which compresses it and extrudes long plugs of finished clay that is thrown into pots on a wheel. Some clay is rolled into slabs and draped over plaster molds. This treatment, called [...] "jiggering" [...] is a time honored method of producing many pots that are identical.|$|E

5000|$|Western raku is {{typically}} {{made from a}} <b>stoneware</b> <b>clay</b> body, bisque fired at [...] and glaze fired (the final firing) between 800 - 1000 C, which falls into the cone 06 firing temperature range. The process {{is known for its}} unpredictability, particularly when reduction is forced, and pieces may crack or even explode due to thermal shock. Pots may be returned to the kiln to re-oxidize if firing results do not meet the potter's expectations, although each successive firing has a high chance of weakening the overall structural integrity of the pot. Pots that are exposed to thermal shock multiple times can break apart in the kiln, as they are removed from the kiln, or when they are in the reduction chamber.|$|E
50|$|Because {{temperature}} {{changes are}} rapid during the raku process, clay bodies used for raku ware {{must be able}} to cope with significant thermal stress. The usual way to add strength to the clay body and to reduce thermal expansion is to incorporate a high percentage of quartz, grog, or kyanite into the body before the pot is formed. At high additions, quartz can increase the risk of dunting or shivering. Therefore, kyanite is often the preferred material, as it contributes both mechanical strength and, in amounts up to 20%, significantly reduces thermal expansion. Although any clay body can be used, white <b>stoneware</b> <b>clay</b> bodies are unsuitable for the western raku process unless some material is added to deal with thermal shock. Porcelain,however is often used but it must be thinly thrown.|$|E

For example, he talks about how he {{had a crush on}} a girl because she had a large scar on her face. Collins way of throwing is added to through the way he decorates his pots. Through the woodfire process he creates imperfections by placing pots on their side on top of shells. Collins mentioned that through the process of putting pots on their sides and stacking them on their sides the interesting area of the pots will not be on the bottom but on the front. Through woodfire in anagama kilns decoration can be made by stacking pots {{on top of each other}} and Collins does so.|$|E

50|$|The {{area around}} Bunzlau {{is rich in}} clays suited to the potter's wheel. Typically, {{utilitarian}} Bunzlauer pottery was turned on a kick wheel, dried leather-hard, dipped in a slip glaze and then burnt in a rectangular, cross-draft kiln. Although fired at temperatures of up to 2,400 F and often classified as <b>stoneware,</b> the <b>clay</b> actually does not vitrify and Bunzlauer pottery is better categorized as high-fired earthenware. In order to make their pottery watertight, Bunzlauer potters applied a coating of liquid clay, or slip. When fired, the slip glaze varied from a chocolate to dark brown. Since the fabric of Bunzlauer ware retains some porosity, the pottery conveniently has been suited for cooking over an open fire or for baking in an oven, {{as well as for}} storage.|$|R

50|$|Sue ware was the {{earliest}} <b>stoneware</b> (<b>clay</b> ware fired at 1200-1300˚ C) produced in Japan. Its manufacture {{began in the}} 5th century AD and continued in outlying areas until the 14th century. Although several regional variations have been identified, Sue was remarkably homogeneous throughout Japan. The function of Sue ware, however changed over time: during the Kofun period (300-710 AD) it was primarily funerary ware; during the Nara period (710-94) and the Heian period (794-1185), it became an elite tableware; and finally it {{was used as a}} utilitarian ware and for the ritual vessels for Buddhist altars. The first use of the potter’s wheel in Japan can be seen in Sue ware. While Sue wares combined wheel and coiling techniques, the lead-glazed earthenware made under Chinese influence from the 8th to the 10th centuries include forms made entirely on the potter’s wheel.|$|E
5000|$|Michael Cardew, who was {{appointed}} to the post of Pottery Officer in the Department of Commerce and Industry in the colonial Nigerian Government in 1951, established the Pottery Training Centre in Abuja in April, 1952. In 1954, Ladi Kwali joined the Abuja Pottery as its first female potter. There, she learned wheel throwing, glazing, kiln firing, production of saggars, and the use of slip, eventually assuming the role of instructor. She made bowls with sgraffito decoration, which involved dipping vessels in red or white slip and then scratching the decoration through the slip to the underlying body, using a porcupine quill. By the time Cardew left his post in 1965, the Centre had attracted four additional women from Gwari: Halima Audu, Lami Toto, Assibi Iddo, and Kande Ushafa. These women worked together in one of the workshops, which they called Dakin Gwari (the Gwari room), to hand-build large water pots. They would shape and scrape the insides of the pots with the shell of a snail, a hard seed pod or a calabash rind. Then, they adapted their traditional incised designs, by inlaying them with a white kaolin and feldspar slip, which would gravitate into the depressed decorations. After these pots were fired with a translucent celadon glaze, the areas with slip would appear pale green in contrast with the dark green or iron red stoneware body of the vessels. Because the hand-built, ornately decorated pots were glazed and fired in a high-temperature kiln, they represent an interesting hybrid of traditional Gwari and western studio pottery. The quintessential Ladi Kwali pot was coiled in a <b>stoneware</b> <b>clay,</b> decorated with lizard patterns and fired with a dark shiny glaze. For Western viewers and collectors, the dark glaze was a metaphor for the pots' [...] "Africanness." ...|$|E

Exploring and study on artificial reef {{is carried out}} by several agencies such as Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center (SEAFDEC) and SIRIM Bhd Malaysia. SEAFDEC especially thorough research contributed to marine life. According to Ahmad Ali SEAFDEC has been using reinforce concrete materials since 1986 until today, in Pulau Payar Marine Park Kedah. They discover that the concrete artificial reef is difficult to produce, suitable for small fishes. It is easier to build an artificial reef using stoneware ceramic than concrete cement. The ceramic reef can stand drastic thermal change that happen under sea-bed, which could break the cement artificial reef. However, ceramic <b>stoneware</b> <b>clay</b> is an alternative materials for an artificial reef alternative because it is cheaper and it is has better quality. This research is to exploit the local <b>stoneware</b> <b>clay</b> from the area of Sabak Bernam because the area {{is closer to the}} sea to setup artificial reefs. Other than that, it facilitates the process of artificial reef production. Most of the artificial reef design in Malaysia does not have an artistic impact. The sculpture artificial reef could attract art lovers to enjoy the beauty of the underwater art gallery. The objective in this research is to introduce new design for artificial reef in Malaysia. The new developed design of artificial reef will remain as a shelter and source of food for marine life. The study will be a new design development for the future artificial reef in Malaysia...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} idea of Active Imagination {{as a tool for}} the making of artworks. It also {{suggests}} this tool can be used to consider artworks. The written thesis examines the understandings of the collective unconscious as propounded by Carl G. Jung. The thesis explains the nature of Active Imagination as explained and modeled in The Red Book by Carl G. Jung. My creative work is considered as a continuation of this process which produces symbols. I write of how these symbols are related to historic, mythic and ritual practices as well as to examples from contemporary art and cultural practice. I particularly consider how the complex concepts within the symbol, although they appear subjective, have repetitions and recurrences in many forms over many cultural situations with similar complex meanings. Some of the theorists of the psyche who have informed this work include Carl G. Jung, James Hillman and Wolfgang Giegerich. As well, many artists have contributed, through their insights, to my understanding. Artists include Joseph Beuys, Anselm Kiefer, William Robertson and Susan Hiller. My creative work comprises a series of ceramic sculptures interacting with found objects. The ceramic works have been hand-built, coiled and slabbed. I have used earthenware and <b>stoneware</b> paper <b>clays,</b> and a variety of commercial glaze recipes. Found pieces have been fired within the works, which have been glazed and reglazed to acquire a specific surface. These works have sometimes had glass and other materials added in a firing.

40|$|Solo show which {{aimed to}} explore ideas about the {{relationship}} between ceramic material and myths of creation by making a substantial group of figurative work based on fabled characters such as Prometheus and the Golem. The research project explored connections between material and concept through the use of archaic narratives from mythology. It established the importance of historic continuity as a major element in Brown’s practice, through stylistic references to archaeology and archaic artefacts. The artefacts offer a contribution to the figurative language of ceramics and to the dialogue within the discipline about the relevance of material based practice in contemporary visual culture. Brown researched creation narratives and myths and made several drawings from life to develop the models for the ceramic figures’ moulds. These were cast from <b>stoneware</b> and brick <b>clay</b> and assembled in sections. Pieces include: Prometheus, Kalos Thanatos, Minerva’s Helpers 1 & 2, Portrait of the Golem, Portrait of Prometheus, Heads from The Glyptotek, Ex Votos for a Broken Heart. Perimeter Gallery is well established as a gallery with a serious interest in ceramics as contemporary sculpture, showing work by Antony Caro and Peter Volkous amongst others. The exhibition, supported by the British Council, gave Brown an opportunity to establish her contribution to this context internationally. A major work from the exhibition, The Delphic Twins, was acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts in Racine, Illinois. The themes were explored further in group exhibitions both in the UK and abroad including British Studio Ceramics at the Philadelphia Clay Studio; Figurative Ceramics curated by Michael Flynn at the Crafts Council in the V&A, accompanying the publication of Flynn’s book; and Sterling Stuff, a group show originating at Gallery Pangolin, which toured both to Iceland and to the Friends Room at the Royal Academy and included major artists such as Antony Gormley, Nicola Hicks and Damien Hirst...|$|R

40|$|This {{exhibition}} of handmade ceramic work was created {{over three years}} in the ceramics studios at UCA, Farnham. The work is an exploration of the artist's own African and South African identities. The exhibition forms part of a practice-led PhD thesis entitled: Africa and the West: a contested dialogue in modern and contemporary ceramics. The exhibition comprises three themes in which an animal or animal-related symbol {{has been used as a}} metaphor and a starting point for examining questions of identity and representation. In the first phase this is relatively simple. Nguni cattle are synonymous with KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where the artist comes from. In 'Object/ify', cattle forms are arranged to create a large herd-like grouping. The second theme is centred on notions of official forms of identification and identity documents. The plastic ear tag commonly used to 'mark' cattle in commercial farming practices all over the world have been remade in clay in their hundreds, and suspended using silk thread. The third animal symbol is more abstract. The group of insects known collectively as 'wood-borer' pose a significant threat to suburban houses in the port city of Durban, South Africa. To get rid of these insects, pest control companies use extermination tents. These large tarpaulins cover entire houses during fumigation. The striking forms of these giant 'skins' over houses have been translated into an installation of ceramic 'Extermination Tents' made from thin porcelain and terracotta paper clay. Inner structures of grey <b>stoneware</b> <b>clay</b> that echo scaffolding hold up some of these fragile tents. Through this careful grouping of objects, the project moves away from rural symbols. This draws more closely from the artist's own experience, that of growing up in an African city...|$|E
40|$|In this {{specially}} commissioned artwork for Ikons of Identity, a group exhibition {{around the}} significance of the mask in our culture, Brown examined the theme by creating a ceramic installation comprising a conventional family group. The project explored psychoanalytic theory about the persona as a means of protection by examining the nature of relationships, communication and loss. Each family member wore a mask, their outward persona, while negative plaster casts of their real faces were hung on the wall nearby like family photographs. The use of the casting as the central making process reflected an ongoing interest in the mould {{as a metaphor for the}} human condition. The presentation reflected Brown’s understanding of the concept of the persona. The life size moulds for these brick and <b>stoneware</b> <b>clay</b> figures were developed from drawings from life and their plaster portraits were derived from casts of the original heads. The presentation of the group of artefacts and its relationship to the space it occupied broke away from the ceramic convention of a single plinth based object, exploring the use of installation and making reference to the relationship of ceramics to other materials. Craftspace Touring, an organisation committed to the broad dissemination of its exhibitions, invited 18 artists (including Caroline Broadhead, Paul Derrez and Freddie Robbins) from a variety of disciplines to make work for this exhibition. It toured the UK for several months (venues included York City Art Gallery, Worcester City Art Gallery and Leicester City Art Gallery) and was backed up with an illustrated catalogue. Brown was invited to explore these ideas further in a group exhibition About Face: Get Your Head Around Sculpture in Croydon Clocktower Museum, showing a group of ceramic heads and plaster portraits. This show included international artists from a range of contexts including Tracey Emin, Henry Moore and Antony Gormley and gave Brown a further opportunity to demonstrate the power of ceramics to convey serious meaning...|$|E
