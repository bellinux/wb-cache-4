30|$|We {{also wanted}} {{a high level}} of {{flexibility}} in the simulation environment. Castalia [10] was created out of the need to have a simulator designed for WSN research. It has advanced and accurate radio and wireless channel models. Castalia is built on OMNeT++, a framework which provides the basic tools to write simulators. In Castalia, nodes are OMNet++ modules. This makes it easy to add our energy harvesting framework. We will briefly discuss the <b>software</b> <b>extension,</b> without going into details.|$|E
50|$|Particularly {{with modern}} cloud {{software}}, a hybrid model of custom software {{is possible in}} which the main {{focus is on the}} COTS software - mainly the mismatch between its features, functions and the business requirements, preferences and expectations. The idea here is to buy a COTS software which satisfies maximum number of requirement and develop a custom <b>software</b> (<b>extensions</b> or add-ons) to fill the gaps left by it. This is the standard approach used when implementing SAP ERP, for example.|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”Current {{automotive}} {{software is}} evolving to integrate <b>extension</b> <b>software</b> with control software. Software integration increases {{the complexity of}} software and can cause system fault that threats safety of automobile. To solve this problem, <b>extension</b> <b>software</b> should be isolated from control software. However, this isolation alone {{is not sufficient to}} prevent <b>extension</b> <b>software</b> from faulting control software {{due to the lack of}} secure device access. In this paper, we propose a secure automotive software platform that has secure device access method with TrustZone. Our method restricts a direct access of the <b>extension</b> <b>software</b> and supports multicore processors. Measured overhead of our platform shows less than 1 % degradation, and the maximum bandwidth of device access is achieved up to 5 MB/s...|$|R
