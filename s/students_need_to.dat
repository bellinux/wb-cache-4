For out-of-province first year undergraduate students, a high school average of 95% is required to receive a guaranteed one-year entrance scholarship. To be considered for the same scholarships, Quebec CEGEP students need a minimum R-score of 35.5, United States high school students need a minimum A average {{as well as at}} least 700 in each SAT or 33 in the ACT, and French Baccalaureate students need an average of 15.5 plus a minimum score of 14 in each course; similarly, students in the British education system need As in both GCSE Level and predicted Advanced Level results, and International Baccalaureate <b>students</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> attain a minimum overall average of 6.9 on predicted grades or a score of 42 on exam results. In general, entrance scholarship recipients rank in the top 1–2% of their class.|$|E

25|$|Qualitative {{research}} is sometimes {{said to have}} as its goal {{the understanding of the}} sample studied, rather than generalizing from the sample to the population. However, the results of qualitative research can be applied to other settings—as long as the reader of the research understands the limitations. For example, the research findings of a qualitative case study of primary school children in a particular school and their mobile phone usage will tell us more about the mobile phone usage of children in the general population, than of adults. However, the type of school (public or private), where it was located, and the socio-economic background of the <b>students</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be taken into consideration when applying any findings to other settings (either schools or the general population of children).|$|E
25|$|Undergraduate: The {{admission}} {{system of}} Islamic University of Technology (IUT) {{is different from}} other universities of Bangladesh for BSc and higher diploma programs. (In Bangladesh all public universities conduct enrolment examinations to select the students; students can come from any ethnic group and religion.) IUT authority only selects Muslim students as per their results in secondary and higher-secondary level. A placement test determines {{the position of the}} students against their choice which they had given on the admission form. Prospective Muslim <b>students</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> fill a form and submit it to the ministry of manpower and employment of their respective countries. The form can be collected from IUT office or the respective ministry. It is also available in the university website. IUT was established to support only Muslim students of all the countries of OIC. It takes students from the respective governments, and a majority of the students are Bangladeshi Muslims. Previously, only male Muslim students were eligible to apply but from the year 2016, IUT started a female section as well.|$|E

30|$|While the {{previous}} section outlined how readers make sense of text, it is now of further interest how the created situation model serves to answer questions in tests such as the PISA literacy assessment. At the surface, answering such questions requires two phases. First (cf. III.b), the <b>student</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> cognitively query potential solutions by retrieving and/or inferring information from the memory and to decide for a subset of solutions. Second (cf. IV), the <b>student</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> articulate the chosen solution. These phases {{interact with each other}} and can iterate several times.|$|R
25|$|Students are {{admitted}} after {{they pass the}} Higher Secondary Exam (HSC exam). In earlier days students partake in entrance examinations, a separate one for each department. But now <b>students</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> partake under unit of different faculty. This has been a contentious issue, as {{there used to be}} only one exam for each faculty, after which students would be allocated to departments according to their result and choice of program. As a public university, University of Rajshahi's tuition fees are relatively low; nevertheless, a hike in admission fees, during the 2006–07 session, have drawn criticism from student bodies. As of 2007, the university awards a total of 340 scholarships, whose annual value is around 1.1million taka. In addition, there are merit awards given by residential halls, departments and the university itself. Students are also eligible for the Prime Minister's Gold Medal award. All colleges of the northern and southern regions of the country used to be affiliated with University of Rajshahi. However, the administration of colleges across the country was taken over by the National University when it was established in 1992.|$|E

2500|$|Italian actuaries {{also receive}} their {{training}} through university plus a single examination {{given by the}} state (Esame di Stato). The studies usually take {{a total of five}} years to complete, three (Triennale) plus two (Magistrale), because <b>students</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> pass at least 30 exams (the exact number depends on the university and curriculum), many with both written and oral components on actuarial and economic topics. After university, to become qualified to sign statements of actuarial opinion, students must pass the Esame di Stato, which is offered twice a year in Rome and Trieste; the Esame di Stato consists of two written sections, a practical portion, and an oral exam.

2500|$|Of course, {{achieving}} such a {{goal is not}} automatic nor easy, as {{he suggests}} {{that the role of}} the teacher is critical to this process. <b>Students</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be helped by teachers to separate themselves from unconditional acceptance of the conditions of their own existence. Once this separation is achieved, then students may be prepared for critical re-entry into an examination of everyday life. In a classroom environment that achieves such liberating intent, one of the potential outcomes is that the students themselves assume more responsibility for the class.

2500|$|There are no university-sponsored {{scholarships}} in Germany, but {{a number}} of private and public institutions award scholarships—usually to cover living costs and books. There is a state-funded study loan programme, called BAföG (Bundesausbildungsförderungsgesetz, [...] "Federal Education Aid Act"). It ensures that less wealthy students can receive up to €649 per month for the standard period of study if they or their parents cannot afford all of the costs involved with studying. Furthermore, <b>students</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> have a prospect of remaining in Germany to be eligible; this includes German and EU citizens, but often also long-term residents of other countries. Part (typically half) of this money is an interest-free loan that is later repaid, with the other half considered a free grant, and the amount to be repaid is capped at €10,000. Currently, around a quarter of all students in Germany receive financial support via BAföG.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} metrics {{by which the}} best {{performing}} countries in the TIMMS (the [...] "A+ countries") are measured: focus, coherence, and rigor. Focus {{is defined as the}} number of topics covered in each grade; the idea is that the fewer topics covered in each grade, the more focus can be given to each topic. The definition of coherence is adhering to a sequence of topics covered that follows the natural progression or logical structure of mathematics. The CCSSM was compared to both the current state standards and the A+ country standards. With the most number of topics covered on average, the current state standards had the lowest focus. The Common Core Standards aim to fix this discrepancy by helping educators focus on what <b>students</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> learn instead of becoming distracted by extraneous topics. They encourage educational materials to go from covering a vast array of topics in a shallow manner to a few topics in much more depth.|$|E

Young writers, for example, may find that their writing resembles Homer's when he attempts to write restaurant reviews in 'Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner.' Homer's diction is poor, his piece rambles off, and he attempts to make the word count by repeating 'Screw Flanders' several times. We can thus illustrate that <b>students</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> reduce wordiness , while developing their arguments through pertinent content or parallelism. We can also stress revision by showing what Lisa is able to do when she helps her father brainstorm. For example, when they need two more words to end the review, Lisa replaces 'Screw Flanders' with 'Bon appétit'." ...|$|E
