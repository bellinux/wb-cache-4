Results are presented for how the mean relative humidity distribution varies in response {{to changes in the}} distribution of <b>saturation</b> specific <b>humidity</b> and in the amplitude of a tropical moisture source. Changes in the tropical moisture source are found to have little effect on the relative humidity poleward of the subtropical minima, suggesting a lack of poleward influence despite much greater water vapor concentrations at lower latitudes. The subtropical minima in relative humidity are found to be located just equatorward of the inflection points of the <b>saturation</b> specific <b>humidity</b> profile along the isentropic surface. The degree of mean subsaturation is found to vary with the magnitude of the meridional gradient of <b>saturation</b> specific <b>humidity</b> when other parameters are held fixed. The atmospheric relevance of these results is investigated by comparison with the positions of the relative humidity minima in reanalysis data and by examining poleward influence of relative humidity in simulations with an idealized general circulation model.

40|$|Variations in zonal surface {{temperature}} gradients and zonally asymmetric tropical overturning circulations (Walker circulations) are examined {{over a wide}} range of climates simulated with an idealized atmospheric general circulation model (GCM). The asymmetry in the tropical climate is generated by an imposed ocean energy flux, which does not vary with climate. The range of climates is simulated by modifying the optical thickness of an idealized longwave absorber (representing greenhouse gases). The zonal {{surface temperature}} gradient in low latitudes generally decreases as the climate warms in the idealized GCM simulations. A scaling relationship based on a two-term balance in the surface energy budget accounts for the changes in the zonally asymmetric component of the GCM-simulated surface temperature gradients. The Walker circulation weakens as the climate warms in the idealized simulations, as it does in comprehensive simulations of climate change. The wide range of climates allows a systematic test of energetic arguments that have been proposed to account for these changes in the tropical circulation. The analysis shows that a scaling estimate based on changes in the hydrological cycle (precipitation rate and <b>saturation</b> specific <b>humidity)</b> accounts for the simulated changes in the Walker circulation. However, it must be evaluated locally, with local precipitation rates.

Quasi-geostrophic theory suggests that extratropical precipitation amounts should depend multiplicatively on the pressure gradient, <b>saturation</b> specific <b>humidity,</b> and the meridional temperature gradient. This physical insight {{has been used to}} guide the development of a suitable statistical model for precipitation using a mixture of generalized linear models: a logistic model for the binary occurrence of precipitation and a Gamma distribution model for the wet day precipitation amount. The statistical model allows for the investigation of the role of each factor in determining variations and long-term trends. <b>Saturation</b> specific <b>humidity</b> q(s) has a generally negative effect on global precipitation occurrence and with the tropical wet pentad precipitation amount, but has a positive relationship with the pentad precipitation amount at mid- and high latitudes. The North Atlantic Oscillation, a proxy for the meridional temperature gradient, is also found to have a statistically significant positive effect on precipitation over much of the Atlantic region. Residual time trends in wet pentad precipitation are extremely sensitive to the choice of the wet pentad threshold because of increasing trends in low-amplitude precipitation pentads; too low a choice of threshold can lead to a spurious decreasing trend in wet pentad precipitation amounts.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The {{possible}} {{change in}} orographic precipitation {{in response to}} global warming is a rising concern under climate change, which could potentially cause significant societal impact. A general circulation model was employed to simulate the climate on an aquaplanet which has idealized mountains at its mid-latitudes. It was found that orographic precipitation at northern mid-latitudes could increase by rates faster than the Clausius-Clapeyron scaling, 7 %/K of surface warming, in doubling CO 2 simulations, while at southern mid-latitudes orographic precipitation decreased. The frequency of extreme events increased at all latitudes of the idealized mountains. Through a simple diagnostic model {{it was revealed that}} the changes in the climatological means of orographic precipitation rates were mostly determined by the changes in three variables: the speed of the wind component perpendicular to a mountain, the vertical displacement of saturated parcels, and the moist adiabatic lapse rate of <b>saturation</b> specific <b>humidity.</b> The last variable had relatively uniform contribution to the total changes in orographic precipitation across different latitudes, about 4 - 5 %/K. But contributions from the changes in wind speed and saturated vertical displacement were found to have strong north-south asymmetry, which were linked to the poleward shift of storm tracks. The changes in wind speed had positive contributions in general, with larger contributions at higher mid-latitudes. While the changes in saturated vertical displacement had negative contributions at all latitudes, but larger negative contributions were located at lower midlatitudes. Although the poleward shift of storm tracks greatly affects regional precipitation, following the poleward shift of storm tracks the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of precipitation at the latitudes of maximum precipitation in the control simulation is very similar to that in the warm climate climate simulation, except that precipitation intensity was positively shifted by a constant factor &mdash mainly due to changes in the moist adiabatic lapse rate of <b>saturation</b> specific <b>humidity...</b>|$|R

The present study assessed malaria RDT products for the availability, type and design of desiccants and their information supplied in the instructions for use (IFU). Methods Criteria were based on recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Community (CE) and own observations. Silica gel sachets were defined as self-indicating (all beads coated with a humidity indicator that changes colour upon saturation), partial-indicating (part of beads coated) and non-indicating (none of the beads coated). Indicating silica gel sachets were individually assessed for <b>humidity</b> <b>saturation</b> and (in case of partial-indicating silica gels) {{for the presence of}} indicating beads. Results Fifty malaria RDT products from 25 manufacturers were assessed, 14 (28 %) products were listed by the “Global Fund Quality Assurance Policy” and 31 (62 %) were CE-marked. All but one product contained a desiccant, mostly (47 / 50, 94 %) silica gel. Twenty (40 %) RDT products (one with no desiccant and 19 with non-indicating desiccant) did not meet the WHO guidelines recommending indicating desiccant. All RDT products with self- or partial-indicating silica gel (n[*]=[*] 22 and 8 respectively) contained the toxic cobalt dichloride as humidity indicator. Colour change indicating <b>humidity</b> <b>saturation</b> was observed for 8 / 16 RDT products, at a median incidence of 0. 8 % (range 0. 05 %- 4. 6 %) of sachets inspected. In all RDTs with partial-indicating silica gel, sachets with no colour indicating beads were found (median proportion 13. 5 % (0. 6 % - 17. 8 %) per product) and additional light was needed to assess the humidity colour. Less than half (14 / 30, 47 %) IFUs of RDT products with indicating desiccants mentioned to check the <b>humidity</b> <b>saturation</b> before using the test.

40|$|A novel Lagrangian {{framework}} is developed to attribute monthly precipitation variability to physical processes. Precipitation variability is partitioned into {{a combination of}} 5 factors: air mass origin location, origin surface temperature variation, ascent intensity, mass fraction of ascending air {{and the number of}} ‘wet’ analysis times per month (> 1 mm/ 6 hrs). Precipitation in a target region is linked to ‘origin’ locations of air masses where the water vapour mixing ratio was last set by boundary layer moistening and is a maximum along back trajectories. Applying the technique to the England and Wales region, the factors together account for 83 - 89 % of the observed summer precipitation variability. The dominant contributor is the number of ‘wet’ analyses, which is shown to be associated with cyclone statistics. The wettest summer months are mainly associated with anomalous cyclone duration rather than the number of cyclones. In addition, surface temperature and <b>saturation</b> <b>humidity</b> at the ‘origin’ locations are found to be below their climatological averages (1979 - 2013). Therefore the direct thermodynamic effect of anomalous surface temperature on marine boundary layer humidity acts to reduce monthly precipitation anomalies.

Changes in cyclone statistics have an effect six times larger than the direct thermodynamic factor in both monthly and decadal precipitation variability...|$|E

The present study concerns the nature of adsorbed water {{and its effect on}} the interaction between two surfaces. Computer models of two opposing (1, 0,- 1) crystal surfaces of a-quartz (dimensions 5. 49 x 4. 91 nm) were constructed and up to 1500 water molecules positioned between the surfaces. The simulations were performed in the NVT ensemble in "math mode" at a temperature of 300 K. The axial profiles of density and mobility (the latter resolved in planar and axial components) in the adsorbed layers were studied. The separation between the crystal surfaces was varied, monitoring the adsorbed layer morphology and the forces acting on the crystals. Most of the simulations shown are with 1500 molecules between the plates, giving around 3. 1 adsorbed monolayers, corresponding to a relative <b>saturation</b> (<b>humidity)</b> of 67 % according to the BET isotherm. The density profiles show an ordered packing of molecules in the first two adsorbed layers with density peaks considerably higher than in bulk water and a low molecular mobility. The density tails off to zero, and the mobility rises to above that of bulk water at the surface of the adsorbed layer, which was clearly defined but undulating. Determination of the forces acting on the crystals was difficult due to strong fluctuations on a short time scale, so only simulations for long times yielded statistically significant average forces. At a surface separation of 3 nm, spontaneous bridge forming took place, paired with significant attractive forces between the crystals. The nature of the bridge is discussed. The observed bridging and resulting surface/surface force are shown to be roughly consistent with expectations based on macroscopic theory represented by the BET isotherm, the Kelvin equation (using the surface tension of bulk water), and a bridging force calculated from pressure-deficiency and surface tension contributions...|$|E

40|$|The {{construction}} of physics-based {{models of the}} simultaneous heat and mass transfer on the air-side surface of air-cooled fin-and-tube heat exchangers during dehumidification can present distinct challenges. Because {{only part of the}} external surface of a finite length finned tube may be wetted in the radial and/or axial directions, the determination of the wet/dry boundary for this partially wet tube surface must parsimoniously describe the nonlinear variations in both the refrigerant temperature and air temperature profiles. A literature review indicates that extant heat exchanger models tend not to consider the partially wet conditions due to modeling complexity; moreover, many standard dehumidification models in the literature also exhibit significant deficiencies. For instance, the Lewis number is often incorrectly assumed to be unity, and the air saturation enthalpy at the surface interface is also assumed to be a linear function of temperature in both the Effectiveness model and the LMED (Logarithmic-Mean Enthalpy Difference) model. These simplifying assumptions can often introduce appreciable deviations between simulation outputs and measured data. This paper proposes a new heat exchanger model that aims to address these challenges through new modeling approaches. After reviewing extant heat exchanger models that include the effects of dehumidification, a novel approach based upon the underlying physics is presented to analyze the air-side simultaneous heat and mass transfer. This new approach has a number of distinct advantages, including the fact that it allows scenarios with non-unity values of the Lewis number to be modeled, as well as the fact that the model accuracy is also significantly improved over extant models because of the assumption of the air <b>saturation</b> <b>humidity</b> ratio as a cubic function of temperature. In addition, these models allow the dry-wet boundary for partially wet surfaces to be readily determined from both air flow and refrigerant flow directions. A tube-by-tube analysis (which can be easily extended to a segment-by-segment analysis) including multiple refrigerant phases is adopted to allow for the simulation of complex tube circuitries. Results from this new approach are validated with experimental data reported in literature, and demonstrate good agreement...|$|E

The difference between TMI latent heat and ICOADS is large, and the temporal correlation is extremely low in the entire basin except the Luson Strait. This is owned to that the ICOADS hardly reproduces accurate variability in the data-sparse regions. Also the temporal cross-correlation coefficients of between TMI latent heat and ECMWF or NCEP 2 are considerably lower in the central SCS, may {{be affected by the}} lack of ship observations of ECMWF and NCEP 2 there. The present study also compares meridional structures of the zonal averaged latent heat. The TMI latent heat and OAFlux overestimate the other two satellite-derived products during summer, whereas in winter, the TMI latent heat underestimates the other products in the northern regions. Though the examination of the influence of input variables, we note that the underestimation of TMI latent heat flux than other three satellite derived products in the northern region is mainly caused by larger near-surface air humidity there. While, large sea surface <b>saturation</b> <b>humidity</b> contributes to larger ECMWF latent heat flux. On the other hand, lager latent heat flux of NCEP 2 in central parts and ICOADS in eastern bands is possibly mainly caused by the difference in winds. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{area of the}} Bełchatów Industrial Region is {{characterized}} by relatively not very favour able agroecological conditions for intensive agricultural production. Restrictive elements include small amounts of precipitation, especially {{in the period of}} intensive crops growth, and too big shares of poor soils in classes V and VI (c a, 55 %). On the other hand, thermic conditions and land configuration are favorable for agriculture. In the spatial lay-out, Piotrkow Trybunalski, and rural administrative communes of Grabica and Wola Krzysztoporska have the most favourable index of agricultural usefulness, while administrative comnunes of Kluki, Gomunice and Szczerców - the least favourable one. The investment project under construction causes visible transformations in the natural environment. Agricultural areas tend to shrink. Till the end of 1982, the brown coal mine absorbed an area of 3, 076 ha of land (including 1, 345 ha of arable land) and the power plant - 690 ha (mainly forests). New forms appear in the landscape, i. e. external dumping ground from the mine an ditch giving access to brown coaI deposits. In 1982, relative height of the dumping ground reached 113 m and depth of the ditch - 140 m. Mine drainage led to the lower ing of the underground waters level. A depression crater reached about 320 km in 1982. Withints coverage, a majority of shallow farm wells and small strearns went dry. In order to supply farms wi h water there is being expanded a network of rural water supply system. Its length amounted to 1, 011 km in 1982. Drainage of underground waters causes changes in the soil environment. At the present initial investment stage, this phenomenon can be observed only on organic soils, mainly peat soils in regions where they can be found on permeable formations. <b>Saturation</b> <b>humidity</b> of surface layers of these soils has decreased significantly, which when accompanied by lack of possibilities of irrigation makes them useless as grass land. It cannot be ruled out that along with passage of time the process of degradation will encompass also other arable lands.

50|$|The wet-bulb {{temperature}} is the temperature a {{parcel of air}} would have if it were cooled to <b>saturation</b> (100% relative <b>humidity)</b> by the evaporation of water into it, with the latent heat being supplied by the parcel. A wet-bulb thermometer will indicate a temperature close to the true (thermodynamic) {{wet-bulb temperature}}. The wet-bulb temperature is the lowest temperature that can be reached under current ambient conditions by the evaporation of water only. Wet-bulb temperature is largely determined by both actual air temperature (dry-bulb temperature) {{and the amount of}} moisture in the air (humidity). At 100% relative humidity, the wet-bulb temperature equals the dry-bulb temperature.|$|R
40|$|Metallic {{corrosion}} progresses at a {{very low}} rate at room temperature in a perfectly dry atmosphere and for practical purposes may be ignored, but on humid surfaces is a very relevant phenomenon. The mechanism is electrochemical, with an electrolyte constituted by an extremely thin moisture film {{of just a few}} monolayers or an aqueous film of hundreds of microns in thickness due, for instance, to rain or dew (Rozenfeld, 1972; Barton, 1976; Feliu and Morcillo, 1982; Kucera & Mattson, 1986; Costa et al., 2006). A considerable part of the damage that atmospheric corrosion causes to structures and equipment may be attributed to the condensation of humidity as a result of periodic cooling of the air. The formation of dew depends on the relative humidity (RH) of the air and the change in the metal surface temperature. The drier the atmosphere, the more the temperature must fall in order for humidity to condense; while at high RH a slight drop in temperature can lead to the <b>saturation</b> in <b>humidity</b> of the atmosphere. The fraction of time in which an atmosphere presents a high RH level {{has been shown to be}} a good indicator of its potential aggressivity. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{limited area}} model MAR (Modèle Atmosphérique Régional) is {{validated}} over the Antarctic Plateau {{for the period}} 2004 – 2006, focussing on Dome C during the cold season. MAR simulations are made by initializing the model once and by forcing it through its lateral and top boundaries by the ECMWF operational analyses. Model outputs compare favourably with observations from automatic weather station (AWS), radiometers and atmospheric soundings. MAR is able to simulate the succession of cold and warm events which occur at Dome C during winter. Larger longwave downwelling fluxes (LWD) are responsible for higher surface air temperatures and weaker surface inversions during winter. Warm events are better simulated when the small Antarctic precipitating snow particles {{are taken into account}} in radiative transfer computations. MAR stratosphere cools during the cold season, with the coldest temperatures occurring in conjunction with warm events at the surface. The decrease of <b>saturation</b> specific <b>humidity</b> associated with these coldest temperatures is responsible for the formation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) especially in August-September. PSCs then contribute to the surface warming by increasing the surface downwelling longwave flux. status: publishe...|$|R
