30|$|Introduction Bronchoscopy can be {{particularly}} challenging in patients with acute respiratory distress (ARDS) who required lung-protective ventilation strategies. In a previous study, we showed that a bronchoscope with an external diameter of 4  mm (or less) would allow safer bronchoscopic interventions. Diameter reduction cannot be {{at the expense of}} the suction channel which needs to be sufficient to easily removed thick secretion. From the single-use bronchoscope technology, we proposed an innovation of flexible bronchoscope with a variable outer diameter as follows: a proximal 4  mm diameter for the part inserted in the endotracheal tube, distal head camera with classical diameter (5.3  mm), and 2  mm diameter for the suction channel. The aim of our study was to demonstrate that our prototype of flexible bronchoscope: (1) does not disrupt the protective ventilation, while it is in place in the endotracheal tube (ETT); and (2) enables an efficient <b>suctioning</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|R

Water content was locally monitored by means of a resistivity probe. The water content/resistivity calibration curves of an intact natural unsaturated loess from Northern France extracted by block sampling at two depths (1 and 3. 3 m) were carefully determined, showing good accuracy and repeatability. The validity of two models giving the resistivity of unsaturated soils with respect to their water content was examined...|$|R
40|$|The bearing {{capacity}} of strip footings on unsaturated soils is studied using slip line theory. The suction profiles considered are non-uniform with depth and correspond to vertical {{flow of water}} by infiltration or evaporation. The slip line theory assumes a plastic equilibrium state of a Mohr-Coulomb soil in which suction influences are included using the effective stress concept. This paper shows that {{the influence of a}} non-uniform suction profile on {{bearing capacity}} is significant. When the contribution of suction to the effective stress can be approximated as a function that varies linearly with depth, the effects of <b>suction</b> on bearing <b>capacity</b> can be represented in dimensionless form in separate charts for smooth and rough footings. Using the charts the bearing capacity can be determined for any combination of friction angle, footing width, surcharge, soil unit weight and linear profiles of cohesion and the contribution of suction to the effective stress...|$|R
50|$|The first {{limitation}} of the Humphrey pump {{is that it has}} no <b>suction</b> <b>capacity,</b> in fact it must be installed in a dry sump several metres below the supply level. Given the pump's physical size and the need to protect the equipment against flood events, this is no small engineering exercise, requiring (in the Cobdogla example) several thousand tonnes of concrete. Also, it has a maximum lift of only around 10 metres. Its usual fuel, producer gas, contains very high levels of carbon monoxide, from which staff and visitors need to be protected in the event of accidental leakage. It is due to this concern that the Cobdogla demonstrations were halted.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the <b>suction</b> <b>capacity</b> in clays by using neural networks on the basis of some simple soil properties. For this purpose, a total of 168 data sets obtained from water suction tests were used in the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). These tests were carried out on seven different clay samples by using odometer test equipment. One hundred twenty six data sets were used in the training stage and remaining 42 data sets were used in the testing stage. The best model was determined by using a trial and error approach in which the ANN models were trained with different hidden layer nodes and with different combinations of network parameters. The neural network predictions were compared with the water suction test results. It is seen that, there is a good agreement between the prediction results and the results of experiments. The results of this study demonstrate that the neural network model can serve as an alternative predictive tool for determination of water <b>suction</b> <b>capacity</b> of clay soils...|$|E

This study investigates the microstructure of composite slag cements with and without limestone subjected to cyclic freezing and thawing. Freeze-thaw was assessed on concrete samples in accordance with CEN/TR 15177 but with a modified temperature profile. Microstructure was characterized by SEM and thermogravimetric analysis.

40|$|The {{presence}} of different pore fluids present in unsaturated soils (water and air) complicates {{the measurement of}} sample volume change. Since volume change of the air phase is difficult due to the compressibility of the fluid, it becomes necessary to measure sample volume change by measuring the change in volume {{of water in the}} surrounding triaxial cell. This paper introduces and assesses a new double cell triaxial cell developed by Wykeham Farrance. The design of the new triaxial system is similar to the Wheeler modified triaxial cell (Wheeler, 1988) but uses a glass inner cell wall, to avoid problems of absorption of water by Perspex. Furthermore, the cell has been designed to use a high <b>capacity</b> <b>suction</b> probe that can be fitted through the base pedestal. Issues of de-airing the cell and the accuracy of volumetric measurements that can be achieved are discussed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of a partial odontocete (toothed whale) {{skeleton}} (complete skull with associated ear bones, mandible, teeth, hyoid bones, and cervical vertebrae) from the middle Miocene (ca. 14 - 12 Ma) levels of the Pisco Formation at Cerro los Quesos, Pisco-Ica desert, southern coast of Peru, a new genus and species of beaked whale (Ziphiidae), Nazcacetus urbinai, is described. This small ziphiid, the best documented fossil species to date, is characterized by a strong reduction of the upper and lower dentitions except for a pair of large apical mandibular teeth, a Tasmacetus-like vertex, a short mandibular symphysis, and the abrupt elevation of the dorsal margin of the mandible towards the coronoid process. A phylogenetic analysis indicates that Nazcacetus is a crown ziphiid, in a more crownward position than Berardiinae and Tasmacetus, but branching before the Hyperoodontinae and Ziphiinae lineages. Several morphological traits observed in Nazcacetus, including the reduction of teeth, the small temporal fossa, and the large hamular process, suggest that this taxon possessed the <b>suction</b> feeding <b>capacities</b> of Recent ziphiids, a specialization possibly related to the exploitation by the early ziphiids of a new ecological niche. The presence of large apical teeth on the mandible of Nazcacetus, a character highly dimorphic in recent ziphiids, might indicate that sexual dimorphism was already present as early in ziphiid evolutionary history as the middle Miocene, a hypothesis supported by the nested position of Nazcacetus in the ziphiid phylogenetic tree...|$|R

From specifications of a reference axial pump with only one rotor, two configurations of counter-rotating systems are studied : a system with a lower specific speed, and a system with a smaller specific radius. The numerical study is conducted in stationary regime, with a RANS-type turbulence model. Numerical simulations of the flow in stationary cavitating conditions use an homogeneous model at the thermodynamic equilibrium state. Results obtained for the two counter-rotating systems increase the yield of 12 % for the same operating point. The first configuration decreases the size of 25 %, which is a favorable for the manufacturing cost and the use in the system.

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					The {{evolution}} of ecological divergence in {{closely related species}} is {{a key component of}} adaptive radiation. However, in most examples of adaptive radiation the mechanistic basis of ecological divergence remains unclear. A classic example is seen in the young benthic and limnetic stickleback species pairs of British Columbia. In each pair the benthic species feeds on littoral macroinvertebrates whereas the limnetic feeds on pelagic zooplankton. Previous studies indicate that in both short-term feeding trials and long-term enclosure studies, benthics and limnetics exhibit enhanced performance on their own resource but fare more poorly on the other species&# 8217; resource. We examined the functional basis of ecological divergence in the stickleback species pair from Paxton Lake, BC, using biomechanical models of fish feeding applied to morphological traits. We examined the consequences of morphological differences using high speed video of feeding fish. 				 				 					 						Results 					Benthic stickleback possess morphological traits that predict high <b>suction</b> generation <b>capacity,</b> including greatly hypertrophied epaxial musculature. In contrast, limnetic stickleback possess traits thought to enhance capture of evasive planktonic prey, including greater jaw protrusion than benthics and greater displacement advantage in both the lower jaw-opening lever system and the opercular four-bar linkage. Kinematic data support the expectations from the morphological analysis that limnetic stickleback exhibit faster strikes and greater jaw protrusion than benthic fish, whereas benthics exert greater suction force on attached prey. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					We reveal a previously unknown suite of complex morphological traits that affect rapid ecological divergence in sympatric stickleback. These results indicate that postglacial divergence in stickleback involves many functional systems and shows the value of investigating the functional consequences of phenotypic divergence in adaptive radiation...|$|R

For this purpose, densely compacted GMZ 01 bentonite should present satisfactory thermal stability. In this paper, laboratory tests were con- ducted to obtain hydro-thermal behaviour of densely-compacted GMZ 01 and its water retention proper- ties were determined under both confined and unconfined conditions at temperature: 20, 40, 60 and 80 °C. The vapour equilibrium technique was employed for suction control. results show that, i) the water reten- tion capacity of the highly compacted bentonite under confined/unconfined conditions falls with heating; ii) for high suction (greater than 4 MPa), no difference was observed between the water retention curves of confined and unconfined specimen, while for low <b>suction,</b> the water-retention <b>capacity</b> of confined sample {{was found to be}} significantly lower than that of unconfined sample at same temperature; iii) the hysteresis of the unconfined compacted bentonite decreases as temperature increases; for high suctions (greater than 4 MPa), there is an increasing trend in hysteresis of unconfined bentonite when suction decreases...|$|R
40|$|Pavement design methods {{based on}} the elastic layer theory idealize the {{pavement}} structure as consisting of linear elastic layers and utilize the theory of elasticity to predict limiting stresses and strains. The assumption of elastic behavior may be valid for relatively stiff pavement materials. In unpaved roads, consisting of unbound granular bases overlying cohesive subgrades, the assumption of elastic behavior {{is unlikely to be}} valid. The behavior of such pavements under traffic stresses is markedly nonlinear. Pavement design methods {{based on the}} ultimate strength approach assume shear failure of the pavement structure at sufficiently high traffic stresses. Pavement material behavior is assumed to be plastic rather than elastic. The assumption of plastic response is more realistic for unpaved roads in which traffic stresses exceed the elastic range of the pavement materials. The determination of the ultimate wheel load that a pavement structure can sustain is the most important component of a design process based on bearing capacity theory. Existing solutions are restricted to a narrow range of material properties and are also deficient {{in the manner in which}} they determine ultimate wheel loads. General and accurate solutions for the determination of the bearing capacity of pavement structures are required. The incorporation of climatic factors in the pavement design process is another important component of design based on bearing capacity theory. Existing methods assume full saturation of the subgrade. Experience has shown that in many regions of the world full saturation rarely occurs and the assumption of full saturation leads to overdesign. There is a need to incorporate the influence of matric suction in the determination of ultimate wheel loads. A limit equilibrium solution, which can handle any combination of pavement material properties, is proposed for the determination of bearing capacity in a 2 -layer pavement system. To enable the incorporation of climatic factors in the determination of ultimate wheel loads, limit equilibrium solutions are proposed for the determination of the effects of positive pore-water pressures and matric <b>suction</b> on bearing <b>capacity.</b> The solution developed for the influence of matric <b>suction</b> on bearing <b>capacity</b> is verified in the laboratory using model footing tests in homogeneous soils equilibrated under constant levels of matric suction. A simple method of testing compacted soils in the direct shear apparatus as well as a method of analyzing the test results in terms of the stress state variables is proposed. The method of testing and analysis is shown to give results which are comparable to the results of the modified direct shear test. The method is considered to be a simple and viable alternative for the characterization of shear strength of compacted unsaturated soils. Finally, a method based on bearing capacity theory is proposed for designing unpaved roads whose structure consists of a base layer overlying a subgrade. The method can handle any combination of shear strength parameters as well as constant levels of matric suction in the pavement layers...|$|R
40|$|Centrifuge model {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to examine foundation failure mechanisms during rapid horizontal pushover of an electricity transmission line support tower, simulating a broken transmission line response or wind gust loading. A model transmission tower supported on four pad foundations in clay and backfilled with sand was loaded horizontally and the loads at each foundation were measured during fast and slow pushover. The tests examined the influence of tensile resistance mobilized at {{the underside of the}} footings, which is difficult to reliably incorporate within design practice {{due to a lack of}} accepted quantitative design methods. The measured performance of the tower footings was compared with results from a series of tests where a single footing is subjected to purely vertical loading in compression and tension and was found to be in good agreement. The tower response was back-analysed as a simple push–pull model and the calculated uplift capacity of the footing backfill provided a close match to the observed response of the tower footings subjected to slow pushover. During fast pushover, the additional capacity mobilized due to tensile resistance (suction) created by the reverse bearing capacity beneath the base of the footings subjected to uplift was quantified using a <b>suction</b> <b>capacity</b> facto...|$|E
40|$|In coke-oven {{operations}} flue-gas valves {{are used}} to switch the regenerator function from rich gas firing to lean gas f iring. Compared with the simple geometry of {{the other parts of}} the flow path, which comprise flues and regenerators, the narrow and winding passages of the flue-gas valves give rise to relatively high losses in pressure. Without the construction of high (and therefore expensive) chimneys, this means that operating problems may well arise due the inadequate <b>suction</b> <b>capacity.</b> The project focused on the theoretical and experimental analysis of a coke-oven flue-gas valve. The primary aim was to reduce the pressure drop through the valve without modifying its external geometry. The internal flow characteristics created by different valve geometries under a variety of operating conditions were simulated using the commercial CFD code Fluent/UNS, which provided velocity and pressure distributions. A half-scale model valve was constucted in order to characterise the internal flow behaviour by pressure measurement. A comparison of the results showed good agreement, proving the simulation result s for the original valve as well as the theoretical scale-up to the 1 : 2 model. Basically, the calculations showed that the potential does exist for valve optimisation in respect of pressure drop. The effect produced by a number of different variations was quantified. A modification proposed by Fraunhofer UMSICHT reduced the pressure drop to 10 % of the original value...|$|E

This involved the determination of the soil water retention behaviour and the mechanical behaviour under unsaturated conditions. Soil water retention curves (SWRC) were determined by a series of tests performed on compacted samples comprising various techniques (filter paper, psychrometer, high <b>capacity</b> <b>suction</b> probe and pressure plate). Total and matric suction SWRC following primary drying paths from 25 % of water content were determined. In addition, a series of tests with the filter paper on samples at lower water contents (15 %, 20 % and 22 %) was also performed. The SWRC following drying paths showed behavior similar to scanning curves intercepting the primary curve around 3000 kPa (11 % water content). However, SWRCs that followed wetting paths showed atypical behaviour by intercepting the primary drying curve. For the investigation of the mechanical behaviour a series of constant water content triaxial tests were carried out in double cell triaxial cells on as-compacted samples, and also samples wetted and dried from as-compacted conditions of 15 %, 20 % and 22 %. A test series of samples tested in a saturated state was also performed to provide a reference state for the unsaturated tests. The unsaturated test series showed that the slope of the critical state line (CSL) in deviatoric stress space (M) was found to be similar for all water contents. The slope of the CSL in ν-ln(p-uw) space (λ) was found to be similar for all water contents, however the CSL shifted position due to variation in the intercept, Γ. Since specimens were at high degrees of saturation, calculations based on effective stress showed a reasonable interpretation of the data. However, a better agreement was achieved using the Bishop’s average stress assumption. A new field measurement system to continuously measure pore water pressure at different depths using high <b>capacity</b> <b>suction</b> probes has been developed. This system was installed at the BIONICS embankment in two different panels (well and poorly compacted). In the well compacted panel pore water pressure behaviour had the tendency to increase with depth, always recording values that were slightly negative at shallower depths and positive at greater depths, showing profiles roughly parallel to the hydrostatic line suggesting that the material was close to saturation. In the poorly compacted panel the behaviour was found to be more variable showing abrupt reactions from the probes to weather events. The differences in behaviour between the well compacted and poorly compacted panels could be related to the laboratory investigations. The well compacted panel was more homogeneous and less permeable (10 - 11 m/s). The poorly compacted panel was more heterogenic, more permeable and hence, during monitoring, showed more dramatic changes in pore pressure compared to the well compacted panel.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, several advancements {{have been made}} in the {{research}} area of the mechanics of unsaturated soils. These advancements can be categorized into two groups; (i) development (or improvement) of testing techniques (or apparatus) to determine the mechanical properties of unsaturated soils and (ii) development of (numerical, empirical or semi-empirical) models to estimate the variation of mechanical properties of unsaturated soils with respect to suction based on the experimental results. Implementation of the mechanics of unsaturated soils in conventional geotechnical engineering practice, however, has been rather limited. The key reasons for the limited practical applications may be attributed to the lack of simple and reliable methods for (i) measuring soil suction in the field quickly and reliably and (ii) estimating the variation of mechanical properties of unsaturated soils with respect to suction. The main objective of this thesis research is to develop simple and reliable techniques, models or approaches that can be used in geotechnical engineering practice to estimate sol suction and the mechanical properties of unsaturated soils. This research can be categorized into three parts. In the First Part, simple techniques are proposed to estimate the suction values of as-compacted unsaturated fine-grained soils using a pocket penetrometer and a conventional tensiometer. The suction values less than 300 kPa can be estimated using a strong relationship between the compressive strength measured using a pocket penetrometer and matric suction value. The high suction values in the range of 1, 200 kPa to 60, 000 kPa can be estimated using the unique relationship between the initial tangent of conventional tensiometer response versus time behavior and suction value. In the Second Part, approaches or semi-empirical models are proposed to estimate the variation of mechanical properties of unsaturated soils with respect to suction, which include: -	Bearing capacity of unsaturated fine-grained soils -	Variation of bearing capacity of unsaturated fine-grained soils with respect to matric suction -	Variation of initial tangent elastic modulus of unsaturated soils below shallow foundations with respect to matric suction -	Variation of maximum shear modulus with respect to matric suction for unsaturated non-plastic sandy soils (i. e. plasticity index, Ip = 0 %) In the Third Part, approaches (or methodologies) are suggested to simulate the vertically applied stress versus surface settlement behavior of shallow foundations in unsaturated coarse-grained soils assuming elastic-perfectly plastic behavior. These methodologies are extended to simulate the stress versus settlement behavior of both model footings and in-situ plates in unsaturated coarse-grained soils. The results show that there is a reasonably good comparison between the measured values (i. e. soil <b>suction,</b> bearing <b>capacity,</b> elastic and shear modulus) and those estimated using the techniques or models proposed in this thesis research. The models (or methodologies) proposed in this thesis research are promising and encouraging for modeling studies and practicing engineers to estimate the variation of mechanical behavior of unsaturated soils with respect to matric suction...|$|R
