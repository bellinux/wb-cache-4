40|$|A {{number of}} models of motion {{perception}} include estimates of eye velocity to help {{compensate for the}} incidental retinal motion produced by smooth pursuit. The ‘classical’ model uses extra-retinal motor command signals to obtain the estimate. More recent ‘reference-signal’ models use retinal motion information to enhance the extra-retinal signal. The consequence of simultaneously adapting to pursuit and retinal motion is thought to favour the reference-signal model, largely because the perception of motion during pursuit (‘perceived stability’) changes {{despite the absence of}} a standard motion aftereffect. The current experiments investigated whether the classical model could also account for these findings. Experiment 1 replicated the changes to perceived stability and then showed how <b>simultaneous</b> <b>motion</b> adaptation changes perceived retinal speed (a velocity aftereffect). Contrary to claims made by proponents of the reference-signal model, adapting simultaneously to pursuit and retinal motion therefore alters the retinal motion inputs to the stability computation. Experiment 2 tested the idea that <b>simultaneous</b> <b>motion</b> adaptation sets up a competitive interaction between two types of velocity aftereffect, one retinal and one extra-retinal. The results showed that pursuit adaptation by itself drove perceived stability in one direction and that adding adapting retinal motion drove perceived stability in the other. Moreover, perceived stability changed in conditions that contained no mismatch between adapting pursuit and adapting retinal motion, contrary to the reference-signal account. Experiment 3 investigated whether the effects of <b>simultaneous</b> <b>motion</b> adaptation were directionally tuned. Surprisingly no tuning was found, but this was true for both perceived stability and retinal velocity aftereffect. The three experiments suggest that <b>simultaneous</b> <b>motion</b> adaptation alters perceived stability based on separable changes to retinal and extra-retinal inputs. Possible mechanisms underlying the extra-retinal velocity aftereffect are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} a method of tracking moving objects with a moving camera. This method interprets tracking as detection of the surface generated by motion boundaries in the spatio-temporal domain and estimates simultaneously the motion induced by camera movement.

The Euler Lagrange descent equations determine simultaneously an estimate of the image motion field induced by camera motion and an estimate of the spatio-temporal motion boundary surface. The EulerLagrange equation corresponding to the surface is expressed as a level set partial differential equation for topology independence and numerically stable implementation.

40|$|Polystyrene {{oligomers}} adsorbed on Ag{ 111 } {{have been}} used as a model system for a molecular dynamics study of polyatomic fragment ejection from large organic adsorbates on metals. The simulation of the interaction between the incident 500 eV Ar atoms and the sample predicts the nature and kinetic energy of the characteristic fragments observed in the low-mass range of the experimental polystyrene secondary ion mass spectrum (SIMS). This agreement confirms that characteristic molecular fragments can be the result of a collisional emission process. Moreover, the results indicate that the ejection of intact molecules occurs frequently. To understand the mechanisms of emission of fragments and parent molecules, a representative set of trajectories has been analyzed in detail. The ejection of characteristic fragments is primarily due to the direct interaction between the primary particle and the organic adsorbate. In contrast, desorption of intact molecules is induced by collision cascades in the sample surface. The emission of energetic intact molecules is best explained by a cooperative uplifting mechanism in which substrate atoms with similar momenta push the molecule upward. For comparison to the 500 eV bombardment conditions, simulations conducted with 5 keV primary particles show that large-scale <b>simultaneous</b> <b>motions</b> in the substrate may also occur, inducing the emission of many silver atoms and organic molecules in a single high action event. 1...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to elucidate the decomposition performed by the human visual system in the segregation of complex motion stimuli into distinct moving surfaces. Subjects were presented with achromatic patterns consisting of four types of elements, generated from two random binary luminance patterns (random-dot checkerboards). The luminance {{of each of the}} four region classes was under program control. Animated sequences of such images were produced by displacing each of the two generating patterns in opposite directions on a frame by frame basis. These displays evoke a wide variety of percepts, depending on the programmed luminance values, including motion in a single direction, <b>simultaneous</b> <b>motions</b> of transparent sheets in opposite directions, dynamic noise with no directional component, or any combination of the above percepts. A theory is presented which relates the strengths of these percepts to the amplitudes of the components in the perceptual decomposition.

The results arc consistent with a motion extraction mechanism which operates on a linear representation of the input imagery.

40|$|Simulating a {{human figure}} {{performing}} a manual task {{requires that the}} agent interact with objects in the environment in a realistic manner. Graphic or programming interfaces to control human figure animation, however, do not allow the animator to instruct the system with concise 2 ̆ 2 high-level 2 ̆ 2 commands. Instructions coming from a high-level planner cannot be directly given to a synthetic agent {{because they do not}} specify such details as which end-effector to use or where on the object to grasp.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of the variational principles of physics, there have been relatively few attempts to consider them for a realistic framework. In addition to the old teleological question, this paper continues the recent discussion regarding the modal involvement of the principle of least action and its relations with the Humean view of the laws of nature. The reality of possible paths in the principle of least action is examined from the perspectives of the contemporary metaphysics of modality and Leibniz's concept of essences or possibles striving for existence. I elaborate a modal interpretation of the principle of least action that replaces a classical representation of a system's motion along a single history in the actual modality by <b>simultaneous</b> <b>motions</b> along an infinite set of all possible histories in the possible modality. This model is based on an intuition that deep ontological connections exist between the possible paths in the principle of least action and possible quantum histories in the Feynman path integral. I interpret the action as a physical measure of the essence of every possible history. Therefore only one actual history has the highest degree of the essence and minimal action. To address the issue of necessity, I assume that the principle of least action has a general physical necessity and lies between the laws of motion with a limited physical necessity and certain laws with a metaphysical necessity.

(3) To describe {{the relationships between}} the cold exposure time, the performance level of a manual task, and the reaction time at reduced ambient temperatures.

The manual dexterity performance was analyzed by evaluating a video tape of the assembly task performed. The simple reaction time task involved pushing several sequential lighted push buttons. The performance task scores were the completion time of these tasks. Performance was measured for 12 subjects at six ambient temperatures (35 (DEGREES) F, 40 (DEGREES) F, 45 (DEGREES) F, 50 (DEGREES) F, 55 (DEGREES) F and 60 (DEGREES) F) during one-hour exposure trials. ^ The data analysis indicated that a decrement of manual dexterity performance due to the reduced temperatures does exist. Within the exposure time of one hour, the simple reaction times were not affected by the reduced ambient temperatures. Neither the dexterity performance nor the simple reaction time was significantly different at different exposure times (25, 35, 45 minutes) to the reduced ambient temperature.

In addition, participants commented that the two devices were identical and sometimes was difficult to tell them apart and because of this it was not easy to think in terms {{of using the}} two together. In terms of its design, participants said that it would have been more cognitively easier if the two devices had a different feeling, tactile wise or in terms of its shape, something akin to the Nintendo Wii Remote and the Nunchuk combination. Despite the form factor, participants were observed using two devices for coordinated tasks, such as Task 16, which was primarily based on elbow flexion/internal rotation. We asked participants if they would want to use two hands more often. They said that they prefer not to because it is not easy to coordinate two hands moving together, especially when they were wearing the VR HMD. This was rather surprising. They said that if they had to use two hands, they would not mind doing so but they would rather use one hand. If they had to use two hands, a number of participants suggested it would be preferable if the two hands were going in the same direction or doing the same activity—for example, both hands doing elbow flexion. In addition, they said that they would find it difficult if two hands were doing things simultaneously. They further said that it would be better if interactions requiring two hands to have asynchronous actions, with one hand doing one action first, and afterward the other hand can perform a follow up action. This is in line with research about dual hand interaction techniques [20, 25, 26, 48, 49]. For example, for text entry activities, when using two hands at the same time, it can lead to faster performance, but it can also decrease their accuracy [26, 48]. In addition, when performing two-handed simultaneous marking menu strokes, it has been reported that the participants had the slowest reaction time because of the extra cognitive burden in “remembering and planning their strokes when coordinating <b>simultaneous</b> <b>motions</b> of two hands” [42; p. 16.14].|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Women’s {{gymnastics}} has {{the highest}} injury incidence rates for NCAA female college athletes. Gymnastics maneuvers may require support and transfer of the entire body weight from the feet to the hands. Such motions cause excessive loading and stress across joint surfaces which on occasion can exceed the mechanical strength of upper limb joints and supportive musculoskeletal structures, resulting in injuries ranging from acute fractures to chronic overuse injuries like osteochondritis dissecans. Recent technological advances have only now {{made it possible to}} analyze the complex and <b>simultaneous</b> <b>motions</b> in multiple planes required for evaluation of even the most basic gymnastic maneuvers like the round-off back handspring (ROBHS). OBJECTIVES: There is a paucity of data characterizing upper extremity injury causation and biomechanical risk factors in the small number of gymnastics studies conducted. The first hand contact for any gymnastics skill has never been quantitatively assessed. Therefore, the primary objective {{of this study is to}} perform a detailed 3 D biomechanical characterization of the round-off back handspring (ROBHS) first hand contact and evaluate any potential correlations to upper extremity injury determinants. METHODS:	 A 3 D motion capture camera and force plate system captured the relative positon of reflective markers affixed to 62 anatomical positions on subjects during performance of an ROBHS. A virtual model of each subject was constructed using Nexus C-motion software. Programming with Visual 3 D and MATLAB software was used to calculate desired force, kinematic and kinetic variables such as joint torques and angles. Past medical history questionnaires were administered, and clinical range of motion and strength measures were assessed. RESULTS: Compared with other factors analyzed, hand contact order appeared to have the highest degree of influence on upper extremity biomechanics at both the time of initial contact and throughout the entire movement sequence. The second contact limb was correlated with a larger average ground contact force, whereas while the first contact limb was related to a shorter time to peak force development and larger magnitude rotational kinematic variables, especially at the elbow—the primary site of upper extremity injury. For the first hand contact, torque development at the elbow and shoulder appeared to be related, and wrist and shoulder variables were presumably related to ground reaction force (GRF) development. The proposed literature elbow injury mechanism may need some adjustment to reflect the impact of elbow flexion angle on GRF and elbow valgus torque, key variables tied to chronic elbow joint capsule overload injuries. CONCLUSIONS: The novel information provided by this study can be used to guide future recommendations for the prevention of upper extremity injury in gymnastics training and competition. Improved understanding of associated force, kinetic, and kinematic biomechanical variables like joint torque could have implications for movement specific body positioning with the potential for extrapolation to gymnastics moves with similar loading patterns. Possible protective technique interventions based on study findings include increasing second hand elbow flexion during the round-off phase of motion or minimizing the time between hand contacts...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a method for <b>simultaneous</b> <b>motion</b> and {{vibration}} control of light-weight slender robotic arms, known as flexible manipulators. In this paper, a new control algorithm is proposed for a two-link manipulator with elastic links. Design/methodology/approach - The controller includes a MIMO H∞ Loop-Shaping Design (H∞LSD) as the feedback controller, and a command pre-shaping filter as the feed-forward controller. The conventional inputs and outputs of a typical two-link manipulator, that consists of the torques applied by the actuators at the joints, and the joint angles are chosen for the feedback control. Findings - It is shown that by selecting a proper desired loop shape, the H∞LSD is able to control the joint angles of the manipulator, and simultaneously, suppress vibrations of the system so that the high-frequency chatter due to the structural vibration modes does not appear at the outputs. Then it is shown that when the H 8 LSD is equipped with a command pre-shaping filter, more efficient suppression of the chatter at the tip of the manipulator is achieved. The capability and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in driving and stabilizing the manipulator to desired positions and simultaneously suppressing structural vibrations is shown by the simulation of the flexible manipulator in rest-to-rest maneuvers. Practical implications - The paper presents a flexible manipulator and looks at space manipulators.
