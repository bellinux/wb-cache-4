Potentially complicating DNA-based carriage assessment is thewell-documentedhistoryof genetic recom-bination between pneumococci and related species that colonize the upper respiratory tract (4). Recently, when assessing pneumococcal carriage in western Kenya (1) with a multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay for 40 capsular serotypes or serogroups (2), we noted a high frequency of mPCR positivity for cocarried serotypes. This was especially evident in adults who had naso- and oropharyngeal swab spec-imens combined; from these, 122 of 158 (77 %) exhibited 4 or more mPCR serotypes (1). These included 24 of 27 specimens that were negative for the pneumococcus-specific lytA PCR assay (3; unpublished data). The mPCR amplicons sg 10 F/ 10 C/ 33 C and sg 18 A/ 18 B/ 18 C/ 18 F occurred among 59 to 80 % of adults (1). Sequencing of sg 10 F/ 10 C/ 33 C amplicons from 11 carriage specimens revealed five 192 -bp sg 10 F/ 10 C/ 33 C se-quence types, including three from lytA-negative specimens, which shared 90. 1 to 93. 8 % identity to corresponding pneu-mococcal reference 10 F, 33 C, and 35 B <b>sequences</b> (<b>Table</b> 1). Analysis of sg 18 A/ 18 B/ 18 C/ 18 F amplicons from 17 specimens (including three lytA-negative specimens) revealed five se-quence types with 89 to 93 % identity to the 4 serogroup 18 reference <b>sequences</b> (<b>Table</b> 2).

40|$|International audienceThis article {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} stacking <b>sequence</b> <b>table</b> (SST) for the optimal design of laminated composite structures with ply drops. The SST describes the sequence of ply-drops ensuring the transition between a thick guide laminate and a thinner one. A blended design is represented by a SST combined with a thickness distribution over the regions of the structure. An evolutionary algorithm is specialized for SST-based blending optimization. Optimization of the sequence of ply-drops with the proposed algorithm enables satisfying design guidelines {{that could not have}} been considered in previous studies. An extensive set of design guidelines representative of the actual industrial requirements is introduced. The method is applied to an 18 -panel benchmark problem from the literature with convincing results. In particular, the present results show that strength-related guidelines can be enforced without significantly penalizing the stiffness behavior and consequently the mass of the structure...|$|E
