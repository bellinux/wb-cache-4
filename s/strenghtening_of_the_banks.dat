40|$|Examinam-se as razões do fortalecimento dos governadores no atual sistema político brasileiro. Com o fim do regime militar formou-se no país um "federalismo estadualista". De uma parte, a União se enfraqueceu diante das unidades estaduais. De outra, os governadores, diversamente do que se passa com o presidente no âmbito federal, tornaram-se um centro político incontrastável no âmbito estadual. The {{reasons for}} <b>the</b> <b>strenghtening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state {{governors}} in the Brazilian political system are examined. It is argued that, {{as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relative loss <b>of</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union since <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military regime, the president has lost power relatively to the state governors and these are left free to rule almost without cheks and balances...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{authoritarian regime}} in Brazil {{resulted}} in {{new forms of}} democratization of politics and its institutions, with <b>the</b> <b>strenghtening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civil society. The Participatory Budgeting is an important experience of that new way, characterized by <b>the</b> assumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new responsibilities by the local governments. <b>The</b> comparative approach <b>of</b> those experiences, conducted from different party coalitions - in Piracicaba (1989 - 1992) and in Santa Bárbara d'Oeste (1997 - 2000) -, allows a test of their powers and limits from a procedural conception <b>of</b> democracy and <b>the</b> complementary role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participation.

40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>the</b> proof complexity <b>of</b> a {{class of}} propositional formulas expressing a combinatorial principle known as the Kneser-Lovász Theorem. This is a family of propositional tautologies, indexed by an nonnegative integer parameter k that generalizes the Pigeonhole Principle (obtained for k = 1). We show, for all fixed k, 2 Ω(n) lower bounds on resolution com-plexity and exponential lower bounds for bounded depth Frege proofs. These results hold even for the more restricted class of formulas en-coding Schrijver’s <b>strenghtening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kneser-Lovász Theorem. On the other hand for the cases k = 2, 3 (for which combinatorial proofs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kneser-Lovász Theorem are known) we give polynomial size Frege (k = 2), respectively extended Frege (k = 3) proofs.

40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} variability of inner-shelf circulation along the central Oregon coast during the 2004 upwelling season is described using a 70 -km-long array <b>of</b> moorings along <b>the</b> 15 -m isobath. Circulation at three stations located onshore of a submarine bank differed {{from that of a}} station north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> despite <b>the</b> relatively uniform wind forcing and inner-shelf bathymetry present. During upwelling-favorable winds, strong southward alongshelf flow occurred north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> no alongshelf flow occurred onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> and increasing southward flow occurred onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> During downwelling-favorable winds, strong northward flow occurred in the inner shelf onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> while weak flow occurred north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> These alongshelf differences in inner-shelf circulation were due to <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> which isolated <b>the</b> inner shelf onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> from <b>the</b> regional upwelling circulation that was evident at the northernmost station. As a result, circulation onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> was driven primarily by local wind forcing, while flow north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> was only partially driven by local winds. A secondary mode of variability, attributed to <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regional upwelling jet due to remote forcings, contributed <b>the</b> bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variability observed north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> With <b>the</b> time-dependent wind forcing present, acceleration was an important term in the depth-averaged alongshelf momentum equation at all stations. During upwelling, bottom stress and acceleration opposed the wind stress north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> while bottom stress was weaker onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> where <b>the</b> across-shelf momentum flux and the alongshelf pressure gradient balanced <b>the</b> residual <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acceleration and stresses. During downwelling, waters onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> surged northward at magnitudes much larger than that found north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> These spatial variations developed as the season progressed and the regional upwelling circulation intensified, explaining known variations in growth and recruitment of nearshore invertebrate species...|$|R

40|$|A rapid {{development}} {{and changes in}} the market environment brought a new knowledge and experiences. Tools and technics of management {{are becoming more and more}} variable. Therefore, it is neccessary to adapt such tools and methods existing in financial activities with the aim to achieve defined financial goals. Such methods will help a financial manager to manage the finances in a more effective way. Financial activies are as follows: financial planning, organizing of financial processes, financial decision, financial analysis and control. By these activities, the manager will obtain a neccessary capital for the firm, he will alocate this capital properly use it properly. And, in this way, the manager will achieve goals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firm – <b>strenghtening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> position on <b>the</b> market, increasing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> profit and cash-flow, securing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquidity etc. In presented article we will see, how individual financial activities can influence <b>the</b> achievement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firm ´s goals, mainly its liquidity and indebtnes.

40|$|When Sweden {{entered the}} European Union, {{relatively}} important consequences were {{expected in the}} food sector. In this empirical paper, some results from research aiming to explore changes in the market situation, as well as strategic responses in firms, are presented. The results are derived from a total of 45 interviews, conducted among sup-plier firms, retailers and industry organisations in the Swedish food market. Consistent with expectations, some support is given {{for an increase in}} market integra-tion. Nevertheless, such activities and processes {{did not seem to be}} primarily linked to the EU. Firms were increasingly acting in an international arena, but an arena with other bases and demarcations than the EU and the European internal market.

40|$|Optically induced ultrafast {{electronic}} excitations with sufficiently long lifetimes {{may cause}} strong effects on phase transitions like structural and nonmetal to metal ones. Examples are transitions diamond to graphite, graphite to graphene, non-metal to metal, solid to liquid and vapor to liquid, solid. A spectacular case is photo-induced water condensation. These non-equilibrium transitions are an ultrafast response, {{on a few}} hundred fs-time scale, to the fast electronic excitations. <b>The</b> energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photons is converted into electronic one via electronic excitations changing the cohesive energy. This changes the chemical potential controlling the phase transition. In view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advances in laser optics photon induced transitions are expected to become an active area in non-equilibrium physics and phase transition dynamics. Conservation laws like energy or angular momentum conservation control the time during which the transitions occur. Since the photon induced effects result largely from weakening or <b>strenghtening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bonding between the atoms or molecules transitions like solid/liquid etc. can be shifted in both directions. Photoinduced transitions will be discussed from an unified point of view. Comment: 26 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
