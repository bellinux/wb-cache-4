40|$|The {{subject in}} {{of this paper}} is to show {{possible}} ways to optimize pressure force which act on diaphragm spring intended for use in motor vehicle clutch. During the exploitation of the clutch, because of friction linings wearing, pressure force which act on the diaphragm spring is changing. The difference of the acting force when it acts on the diaphragm spring and new linings, and when it acts on diaphragm spring and wear linings (in limits), must be kept in very tight limits. This means that the force in both cases has to be constant. Possible solution to achieve this condition is to have changes in diaphragm spring thickens and diaphragm <b>spring</b> <b>finger</b> angle, and during those changes the diameter of the diaphragm spring will stay unchanged. ...|$|E
40|$|The SA 1358 - 10 and SA 2052 - 4 {{circular}} JT Type plug connectors {{are used}} {{on a number of}} nuclear weapons and Joint Test Assembly (JTA) systems. Prototype units were evaluated for the following specific defects associated with the 95 Sn- 5 Sb (Sn-Sb, wt. %) solder joint used to attach the beryllium-copper (BeCu) spring fingers to the aluminum (Al) connector shell: (1) extended cracking within the fillet; (2) remelting of the solder joint during the follow-on, soldering step that attached the EMR adapter ring to the connector shell (and/or soldering the EMR shell to the adapter ring) that used the lower melting temperature 63 Sn- 37 Pb (Sn-Pb) alloy; and (3) spalling of the Cd (Cr) layer overplating layer from the fillet surface. Several pedigrees of connectors were evaluated, which represented older fielded units as well as those assemblies that were recently constructed at Kansas City Plant. The solder joints were evaluated that were in place on connectors made with the current soldering process as well as an alternative induction soldering process for attaching the EMR adapter ring to the shell. Very similar observations were made, which crossed the different pedigrees of parts and processes. The extent of cracking in the top side fillets varied between the different connector samples and likely the EMR adapter ring to the shell. Very similar observations were made, which crossed the different pedigrees of parts and processes. The extent of cracking in the top side fillets varied between the different connector samples and likely reflected the different extents to which the connector was mated to its counterpart assembly. In all cases, the <b>spring</b> <b>finger</b> solder joints on the SA 1358 - 10 connectors were remelted {{as a result of the}} subsequent EMR adapter ring attachment process. Spalling of the Cd (Cr) overplating layer was also observed for these connectors, which was a consequence of the remelting activity. On the other hand, the SA 2052 - 4 connector did not exhibit evidence of remelting of the <b>spring</b> <b>finger</b> solder joint. The Cd (Cr) layer did not show signs of spalling. These results suggested that, due to the size of the SA 1358 - 10 connector, any of the former or current soldering processes used to attach the EMR adapter ring and/or EMR shell to the connector shell, requires a level of heat energy that will always result in the remelting of the <b>spring</b> <b>finger</b> solder joint attached with either the Sn-Ag or the Sn-Sb alloy. Lastly, it was construed that the induction soldering process, which is used to attach the EMR adapter ring onto the shell, was more likely to have caused the remelting event rather than the more localized heat source of the hand soldering iron used to attach the EMR shell to the adapter ring...|$|E

40|$|To {{compensate}} for thermal expansion the LHC ring has to accommodate about 2500 bellows which, together with beam position monitors, {{are the main}} contributors to the LHC broad-band impedance budget. In order to reduce this impedance to an acceptabe value the bellows have to be shielded. In this paper we compare different designs proposed for the bellows and calculate their transverse and longitudinal wake fields and impedances. Owing to the 3 D geometry of the bellows, the code MAFIA {{was used for the}} wake field calculations. The results presented in this paper indicate that the latest bellows design, in which shielding is provided by <b>sprung</b> <b>fingers</b> which can slide along the beam screen, has impedances smaller than those previously estimated according to a rather conservative scaling of SSC calculations and LEP measurements. Several failure modes, such as missing fingers and imperfect RF contact, have also been studied. ...|$|R

5000|$|Crossbar {{switches}} use switching matrices {{made from}} a two-dimensional array of contacts arranged in an x-y format. These switching matrices are operated {{by a series of}} horizontal bars arranged over the contacts. Each such [...] "select" [...] bar can be rocked up or down by electromagnets to provide access to two levels of the matrix. A second set of vertical [...] "hold" [...] bars is set at right angles to the first (hence the name, [...] "crossbar") and also operated by electromagnets. The select bars carry spring-loaded wire fingers that enable the hold bars to operate the contacts beneath the bars. When the select and then the hold electromagnets operate in sequence to move the bars, they trap one of the <b>spring</b> <b>fingers</b> to close the contacts beneath the point where two bars cross. This then makes the connection through the switch as part of setting up a calling path through the exchange. Once connected, the select magnet is then released so it can use its other fingers for other connections, while the hold magnet remains energized {{for the duration of the}} call to maintain the connection. The crossbar switching interface was referred to as the TXK or TXC (telephone exchange crossbar) switch in the UK.|$|R

40|$|Background/purpose: Anterior {{crossbite}} correction {{is common}} in orthodontic treatment; however, few studies have discussed the change with cephalometric measurements. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the dentofacial changes in anterior crossbite correction by using an upper lingual arch with <b>finger</b> <b>springs.</b> Materials and methods: This retrospective study included 30 patients (13 female and 17 male). According to the number of crossbite teeth, the patients were divided into three groups. We used paired t test, Kruskalâ€“Wallis test, Mannâ€“Whitney U test, and multiple regression analysis to perform statistical analysis. Results: According to overall treatment changes, the dental changes included overjet increase, overbite decrease, upper incisor proclination, lower incisor retroclination and intrusion, upper molar distal tipping with extrusion, and lower molar intrusion. These dental changes resulted in clockwise mandibular rotation and lip position change. Anterior crossbite correction did not require increasing bite appliances. According to multiple regression analysis, the change in overjet was associated with the position of the upper and lower incisor crown tips. The mean rate of upper incisor movement in the horizontal direction was 2. 5 Â mm/mo. The treatment duration exhibited no significant difference among the three groups. Conclusion: Lingual arch with <b>finger</b> <b>springs</b> was effective in anterior crossbite correction regardless of the number of crossbite teeth...|$|R

5000|$|Dietz et al. {{recommended}} that to avoid tipping of molar teeth, a high pull headgear {{can be used}} in conjunction with this appliance. As the ACCO appliance will move the crown of molar distally, headgear will act to move the molar roots distally. In order to avoid loss of anchorage, they also recommended to achieve [...] "overcorrection" [...] of the molar distalization by 2mm or more. Anchorage loss occurs as anterior teeth move mesially, shown by 2mm increase in overjet and also 1st molars moving mesially. The authors also stated that presence of 2nd molars can exacerbate the loss of anchorage. Therefore, addition of <b>finger</b> <b>springs</b> can be added to the 2nd molars to move them distally also.|$|R
