5|$|Different {{societies}} and cultures have used family <b>symbols</b> <b>in</b> advertising to varying extents of success. Because family life stresses in-group benefits, preferences, and successes over {{those of the}} individual, collectivist societies tend to use more family <b>symbols</b> <b>in</b> advertising than individualist societies. For example, Korea, which is reputably collectivistic, has more success with family advertisements than the United States, which is reputably individualistic.|$|E

5|$|Upon the {{independence}} of Belarus from the Soviet Union, the country resurrected national symbols that were used before the Soviet era. These included a flag of red and white stripes and a coat of arms consisting of a charging knight on horseback.

5|$|After this, the Tibetan people's {{trade in}} tiger skins became a {{relatively}} more important threat to tigers.

In addition, the heralds in Britain could sometimes be unfamiliar with Canadian history and <b>symbols.</b> <b>In</b> time, many Canadians with an interest in heraldry began calling for an office that would offer armorial bearings designed by and for Canadians.|$|E
5|$|Between 1996 and 1999, the {{administration}} added crucifixes to many classroom walls, {{a change that}} attracted national attention. Before 1996, crucifixes had hung only in hospital rooms and historic classrooms. Some of these crucifixes are historic works of art, and are noted as such. According to Imam Yahya Hendi, the school's on-campus Muslim cleric, pressure to remove the crucifixes comes from within the Catholic community, while he and other campus faith leaders have defended their placement. The Intercultural Center is an exception to this controversy, rotating displays of various faith and culture <b>symbols</b> <b>in</b> the lobby. In 2009, Georgetown's religious symbols were brought back to national attention after the university administration concealed the name of Jesus in preparation for President Barack Obama's speech on campus.|$|E

40|$|The article treats three {{examples}} of specifi с {{approach to the}} concept of <b>symbol</b> <b>in</b> theology when the higher being (that which is symbolized) is understood to be truly present <b>in</b> its <b>symbol.</b> The fi rst section discusses the doctrine of the <b>symbol</b> <b>in</b> the theurgic Neoplatonism of Iamblichus and Julian. The theory of the symbol evolved by the later Neoplatonists is shown to have been inherited by pseudo-Dionysios. A triple function of the <b>symbol</b> <b>in</b> the works of the Neoplatonists and in the Corpus Areopagiticumis then examined: the safeguarding, the anagosis, and the manifestation. In the second section, the theology of the <b>symbol</b> <b>in</b> Karl Rahner and its later development by Herbert Vorgrimler are discussed. It is concluded that in certain essential points their theory of the revealing or real <b>symbol</b> is close <b>in</b> type to that found in the Later Neoplatonism {{as well as in the}} Corpus Areopagiticum...|$|R

Depictions have existed from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves in France dated to 17,000 years ago, through virtually all ancient and medieval cultures where they once occurred. It has been extensively depicted in sculptures, in paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire, and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoos over the world since the late eighteenth century. Zoos are cooperating worldwide in breeding programs for the endangered Asiatic lions.|$|E

On the left hand side of the grounds, there is a Bodhi tree, a symbol of the enlightenment of the Buddha.

In addition to instructing the schools to teach and play Kimigayo, Kakuei wanted students to raise the Hinomaru flag in a ceremony every morning, and to adopt a moral curriculum based on certain elements of the Imperial Rescript on Education pronounced by the Meiji Emperor in 1890. Kakuei was unsuccessful in passing the law through the Diet that year.|$|E
5|$|The Dresden Codex is {{described}} by historian J. Eric S. Thompson as writings of the indigenous people of the Yucatán Peninsula in southeastern Mexico. Maya historians Peter J. Schmidt, Mercedes de la Garza, and Enrique Nalda confirm this. Thompson further narrows the probable origin of the Dresden Codex {{to the area of}} Chichen Itza, because certain picture <b>symbols</b> <b>in</b> the codex are only found on monuments in that location. He also argues that the astronomical tables would support this as the place of origin. Thompson claims that the people of the Yucatán Peninsula were known to have done such studies around 1200 A.D. Thompson also notes the similar ceramic designs in the Chichen Itza area which are known to have ceased in the early thirteenth century. British historian Clive Ruggles suggests, based on the analyses of several scholars, that the Dresden Codex is a copy and was originally written between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries. Thompson narrows the date closer to 1200 to 1250. Maya archaeologist Linton Satterthwaite puts the date when it was made as no later than 1345. It is the oldest surviving book from the Americas.|$|E
5|$|The Ottawa {{writing system}} is a minor {{adaptation}} of a very similar one used for other dialects of Ojibwe in Ontario and the United States, and widely employed in reference materials and text collections. Sometimes {{referred to as the}} Double Vowel system because it uses doubled vowel symbols to represent Ottawa long vowels that are paired with corresponding short vowels, it is an adaptation attributed to Charles Fiero of the linguistically oriented system found in publications such as Leonard Bloomfield’s Eastern Ojibwa. Letters of the English alphabet substitute for specialized phonetic <b>symbols,</b> <b>in</b> conjunction with orthographic conventions unique to Ottawa. The system embodies two basic principles: (1) alphabetic letters from the English alphabet are used to write Ottawa, but with Ottawa sound values; (2) the system is phonemic in nature, in that each letter or letter combination indicates its basic sound value, and does not reflect all the phonetic detail that occurs. Accurate pronunciation cannot be learned without consulting a fluent speaker.|$|E
