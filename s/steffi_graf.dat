She originally planned to quit after the 2002 Australian Open, her favorite tournament, but changed her mind when she unexpectedly qualified for the year-ending Sanex Championships in Germany. [...] "I thought there's nothing better than to celebrate saying goodbye in front of the home fans in your own country", said Huber.
