The study consisted of two groups, a control group and an intervention group. Participants in the experimental group received scheduled contacts from a lactation educator in the form of home visitations, telephone calls, and written communication, while the control group participants were encouraged to seek breastfeeding support as needed. Demographic measures, duration of breastfeeding, number of breastfeeding <b>support</b> <b>contacts,</b> and formula supplementation were recorded for all subjects. Women in the experimental group received significantly more breastfeeding <b>support</b> <b>contacts</b> than those in the control group; however, breastfeeding duration was similar among women in both groups.

40|$|The {{features}} and capacities of mobile devices offer {{a wide range}} of significant opportunities for providing learning content in workplaces and educational institutions. This new approach of teaching, called mobile learning, allows for the delivery of learning content on the move at any time. Mobile learning supports learning by producing learning content to learners in a modern and acceptable way. The number of mobile learning applications has increased rapidly in educational environments. There are, however, limited mobile learning applications that take advantage of mobile devices to <b>support</b> <b>contact</b> learning in the classroom environment. The aim of this research was to design a mobile learning architecture to effectively <b>support</b> <b>contact</b> learning in the classroom.

40|$|Abstract — Tomorrow’s humanoids {{will operate}} in human environments, where {{efficient}} manipulation and locomotion skills, and safe contact interactions {{will be critical}} design factors. We report here our recent efforts into these issues, materialized into a whole-body control framework. This framework integrates task-oriented dynamic control and control prioritization [14] allowing to control multiple task primitives while complying with physical and movement-related constraints. Prioritization establishes a hierarchy between control spaces, assigning top priority to constraint-handling tasks, while projecting operational tasks in the null space of the constraints, and controlling the posture within the residual redundancy. This hierarchy is directly integrated at the kinematic level, allowing the program to monitor behavior feasibility at runtime. In addition, prioritization allows us to characterize the dynamic behavior of the individual control primitives subject to the constraints, and to synthesize operational space controllers at multiple levels. To complete this framework, we have developed freefloating models of the humanoid and incorporate the associated dynamics {{and the effects of}} the resulting <b>support</b> <b>contacts</b> into the control hierarchy. As part of a long term collaboration with Honda, we are currently implementing this framework into the humanoid robot Asimo.
