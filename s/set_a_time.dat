5|$|The {{qualifying}} {{session on}} Saturday afternoon was split into three parts. The first part ran for 20 minutes and eliminated the cars from qualifying that finished the session 18th or lower. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for}} the race. The second part of qualifying lasted 15 minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions 11 to 17. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} timed runs in Q2, Lewis Hamilton was seven-tenths {{of a second}} quicker than {{teammate}} Rosberg, while the Ferrari cars split the pair to place provisional second and third. Nevertheless, both Mercedes drivers did not go out again. Sebastian Vettel set a second timed lap to improve his time, now {{a little more than}} a tenth behind Hamilton. Many drivers only set one timed lap towards the end of the session, with Pastor Maldonado, Felipe Nasr, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Daniil Kvyat unable to move on into Q3, while Ricciardo did not <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> leaving him fifteenth for the time being.|$|E
5|$|Guido Forti {{alleged that}} Shannon Racing had not paid him any money within the stipulated six-day {{deadline}} after {{the deal was}} concluded and refuted the claim that it now owned 51% of his team. As the team ran out of money, it was doubtful whether it would turn up at the British GP. In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> quick enough to qualify. This was because it was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and {{was running out of}} engine mileage for its cars, only having enough to make a token effort at participation. The team made it to the next race - the German GP - but both cars remained unassembled in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off.|$|E

50|$|Following the Canadian Grand Prix on June 10, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at the Silverstone circuit from June 12-14. Jarno Trulli (Jordan) set the fastest {{time on the}} first day with Olivier Panis (BAR) topping the second day's running, <b>setting</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of 1:22.803 and test driver Alexander Wurz (Benetton) was fastest on the final day, <b>setting</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of 1:22.081, over six-tenths of a second faster than Häkkinen.|$|R

5|$|In Q2, it was Hamilton {{who came}} out on top, exactly six-tenths of a second ahead of Rosberg. Verstappen was third fastest, ahead of Ricciardo in fifth. Kimi Räikkönen had to abandon his first fast lap after running wide in turn four, but later <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> good enough for fourth. Meanwhile, Sebastian Vettel {{recorded}} just one timed lap, saving a set of tyres and was sixth. On his return to Toro Rosso, Kvyat was eliminated in 13th place, while teammate Sainz went through to Q3. Sergio Pérez advanced as well, demoting his teammate Hülkenberg into elimination in the process, who would line up eleventh on the grid. Joining him on the sidelines for Q3 were Jenson Button in twelfth, with Romain Grosjean, Kevin Magnussen and Esteban Gutiérrez lining up behind Kvyat.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton set {{the fastest}} time in Q2 at 1:06.228, the fastest time set in any {{session at the}} Red Bull Ring. However, both Ferrari and Red Bull set their fastest times in Q2 on the supersoft tyres, unlike Mercedes, who used the ultrasoft compound, meaning that both teams were able to start the race on the harder tyre. Realizing this, Mercedes tried to counter the move and sent their cars back out on supersoft tyres, but were unable to improve on their times due to rain {{starting}} to fall. Jenson Button moved into Q3, while his teammate Fernando Alonso did not, ending up 14th on the grid. In 12th place, Wehrlein equalled Manor's highest ever qualifying result, being between the two Haas drivers Esteban Gutiérrez and Romain Grosjean on the grid. Following their problems in Q1, Pérez and Sainz were unable to <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> and were thus eliminated.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton was fastest in Q2, two-tenths of {{a second}} ahead of his {{teammate}} Rosberg. In his last qualifying session with Lotus, Romain Grosjean experienced technical difficulties that forced {{him to come back}} into the pits. Even though he was sent out again, he was unable to <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> stopping his car at turn seven. His teammate Pastor Maldonado also did not proceed into Q3, as did Jenson Button who missed out by two-tenths {{of a second}}. The two other drivers eliminated were Felipe Nasr for Sauber and Max Verstappen, who was unable to match the time of his teammate Carlos Sainz Jr.|$|E

5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. All teams, including Mercedes used the softer tyre compound during the first session (Q1). Jenson Button, who had problems with his car all during practice, was unable to <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when his car broke down on his out lap. Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, with Valtteri Bottas in second. Along with Button, both Manor Marussia cars were eliminated in Q1, as well as Daniil Kvyat– who made a mistake during his final lap– and Pastor Maldonado. Fernando Alonso was the first driver to reach a second qualifying session for McLaren {{over the course of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying, all drivers used the softer compound tyres at least for their second run of timed laps, including the Mercedes pair. While Valtteri Bottas was the last driver to switch from the medium tyres, his Williams teammate Felipe Massa needed a quick lap {{at the end of the}} session to secure his participation in the second qualifying round, after he had been held up by compatriot Felipe Nasr earlier in the session. Fernando Alonso's McLaren broke down due to a loss of power before he was able to <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> with teammate Jenson Button likewise unable to proceed. Both Manor Marussia drivers failed to advance, while Pastor Maldonado in fifteenth was the last driver to be eliminated.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with six drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. In the first part of qualifying (Q1), Nico Rosberg <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of 1:23.002, the fastest of the weekend up to that point, two-tenths of a second ahead of teammate Hamilton. Manor and Sauber occupied the back rows of the grid. Felipe Massa's first lap was seven-tenths of a second slower than the one from his teammate Bottas and as he was unable to set another timed lap, he became the surprise elimination in Q1, behind Jolyon Palmer, who was dropped into 17th place by a late improvement from Jenson Button.|$|E

5|$|The second {{qualifying}} period was fifteen minutes in length, {{and was used}} to set positions eleven through to sixteen. It was once again topped by Nico Rosberg, {{who was the first}} person to <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> under 1:43.000 all weekend. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton locked his brakes on the approach to turn 7, damaging his race tyres. Hamilton narrowly avoided elimination, setting a time good enough to proceed on his last attempt. Romain Grosjean was eliminated in eleventh, having overcome issues with his brake balance. Nico Hülkenberg was a surprise elimination in twelfth, having run consistently at the front of the field throughout the weekend. His elimination was attributed to a miscommunication between himself and his engineer over the amount of fuel he had on board. Carlos Sainz Jr. and Fernando Alonso finished thirteenth and fourteenth to fill the seventh row of the grid, ahead of Gutiérrez.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{remained}} hot and dry for the Saturday morning practice sessions. Michael Schumacher was {{the fastest}} {{driver in the}} third session, setting a time of 1:20.762; Barrichello ended with the third quickest lap time. Häkkinen <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> one-tenth of a second slower than Michael Schumacher and was second fastest. Alesi continued to run quicker and was fourth fastest, faster than Coulthard and Frentzen. Irvine, Trulli, Fisichella and Johnny Herbert completed the top ten. In the final practice session, Coulthard was fastest {{with a time of}} 1:20.405 though he ran down the escape road at Ste Devote and his engine subsequently stalled. Michael Schumacher was second fastest, nearly one-tenth slower than Coulthard. Fisichella opted to use a softer damper and set the third quickest lap, in front of Trulli and Häkkinen. Barrichello, Alesi, Wurz, Frentzen and Ralf Schumacher completed the top ten fastest drivers ahead of qualifying. A crash by Irvine at the swimming pool complex ended his session prematurely.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to several}} rain showers between {{first and second}} practice, the track was again wet during the second session, which limited the drivers to using the {{intermediate}} tyres only. Hamilton was again fastest, setting a time of 1:38.841. Teammate Rosberg crashed at turn seven thirty minutes into the session, damaging a new-specification front wing that the team had deliberately not run in first practice for fear of damage. Rosberg later apologised for the incident, which saw him {{trying to get back}} to pit lane, before his team told him to stop on track, calling an early end to his session. Nico Hülkenberg, Räikkönen, Ricciardo and Carlos Sainz Jr. all finished within one second of Hamilton's time, while Sergio Pérez was at one point {{on his way to a}} new fastest time overall, setting best times in the first two timechecks along the track, before having to slow in the last part of the lap due to heavy rain. The two Manor drivers Pascal Wehrlein and Haryanto covered the highest number of laps, with 24 and 22 laps in 12th and 14th place respectively. Neither Renault nor Williams drivers <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> albeit going on track. The Sauber cars and Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso did not leave the garage at all during the session.|$|E

5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Michael Schumacher clinched his 28th pole position of his career, and his fourth at the circuit, with a time of 1:17.514. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Coulthard, who was three-tenths of a second off Michael Schumacher's pace. Häkkinen qualified third, and stated that his team made changes to his car's set-up having been unhappy with his car in previous sessions. Ralf Schumacher qualified fourth, and said he was pleased with revisions to his car's aerodynamics. Barrichello struggled with the handling of his car taking fifth position and stated that Coulthard prevented him from setting a faster lap time. Frentzen, Fisichella, Button, Salo and Irvine rounded out the top ten positions. Wurz missed out on qualifying in the top ten by two-tenths of a second. Trulli qualified 12th having struggled with oversteer, ahead of Diniz, Alesi, Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa and Villeneuve. Johnny Herbert for Jaguar qualified 17th despite spinning late in the session, and was followed by Zonta, Nick Heidfeld and Jos Verstappen. The Minardi drivers qualified last; Marc Gené outqualified his teammate Gastón Mazzacane by two-tenths of a second.|$|E
5|$|The {{qualifying}} {{session was}} held on Saturday afternoon and lasted one-hour between 13:00 to 14:00 CEST, each driver was allowed up to twelve timed laps, with their fastest lap used to determine their grid position. Cars were timed using a TAG Heuer timing system, which measured to an accuracy of one-thousandth of a second. At {{the end of the}} session, the three fastest drivers had all set the same laptime, the first time this had happened {{in the history of the}} World Championship. Jacques Villeneuve was first to <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of 1:21.072, fourteen minutes into the one hour session. A further fourteen minutes later, Michael Schumacher posted an identical time. With nine minutes of the session remaining, Heinz-Harald Frentzen crossed the line, again with a time of 1:21.072. Under the regulations, in the event of drivers setting equal times in qualifying, the order in which the times were set is considered, with the first driver to set the time given precedence. Villeneuve was awarded pole position on the starting grid for the race, with Schumacher second and Frentzen third. Fourth place on the grid went to the reigning World Champion, Damon Hill, in his Arrows, with a time of 1:21.130, 0.058 seconds behind the time of the leading three. Hill had been on course to get pole position but had to slow towards the end of the lap because of yellow flags due to an incident involving Ukyo Katayama's Minardi.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{remained}} hot and dry for the Saturday practice sessions. Michael Schumacher was {{the quickest}} {{driver in the}} third practice session, {{with a time of}} 1:39.937. Barrichello was second quickest, almost half a second slower than Michael Schumacher. The two Williams drivers were third and fourth; Ralf Schumacher ahead of Montoya. Coulthard secured the fifth fastest time, two-tenths of a second faster than teammate Häkkinen in sixth. Heidfeld, Villeneuve, Irvine and Kimi Räikkönen rounded out the top ten. Benetton driver Jenson Button did not <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> In the final practice session, Ralf Schumacher was the quickest driver with a lap of 1:39.188, almost three-tenths of a second ahead of Montoya. Michael Schumacher was unable to improve his time from the previous session and was third fastest. He was ahead of Häkkinen in fourth, Heidfeld was fifth and Barrichello sixth. Irvine was seventh and Panis eighth. Coulthard, who beached his McLaren in the Agip corner gravel trap, took ninth and Trulli completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E

5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the main Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted ninety minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. The track was dusty when the first practice sessions were held; grip was poor and some drivers were forced onto the run-off areas after they slid off the track. Hamilton set the pace in the first practice session {{with a time of}} 1 minute and 40.887 seconds; almost one-tenth of a second quicker than Kubica. Rosberg and Michael Schumacher set the third- and sixth-fastest times respectively for Mercedes; they were separated by Vettel and Button. Webber was seventh quickest, ahead of Nick Heidfeld. The two Williams drivers completed the top ten; Nico Hülkenberg was ahead of Rubens Barrichello. Hispania driver Bruno Senna spun at turn nine after his left rear suspension broke and stopped on the track without hitting the barriers. Grip was improved for the second practice session, in which Webber <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of 1:37.942—the quickest of the day—despite spinning late in the session. Alonso was second-quickest and Hamilton was third. Kubica set the fourth-quickest time. Button, who was sidelined for most of the session with an overheated exhaust, was fifth. Massa, Vettel, Vitaly Petrov, Rosberg and Kamui Kobayashi made {{up the rest of the}} top ten. Sakon Yamamoto in the other Hispania car caused the session to be suspended after spinning and stopping his car at turn sixteen.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{achieved}} {{his sixth}} pole {{position of the}} season, and his first at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, {{with a time of}} 1 minute and 13.014 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Alonso, with teammate Massa in third, giving Ferrari their best qualifying performance of the season. Webber {{had not been able to}} use his car's KERS and qualified fourth, four-tenths of a second behind Vettel. Hamilton and Button qualified in fifth and seventh respectively and McLaren blamed the slow pace on too high levels of downforce on the high-speed circuit. The Mercedes drivers qualified in sixth and eighth, and Heidfeld and Vitaly Petrov completed the top ten. Paul di Resta was in 11th position, ahead of fellow rookies Pastor Maldonado and Kobayashi. Adrian Sutil struggled with grip throughout the session and was 14th; following him were Sébastien Buemi, Barrichello and de la Rosa. Jaime Alguersuari qualifying in 18th complained of insufficient grip and brake balance, and at the back of the grid were the Lotus, HRT and Virgin drivers. D'Ambrosio did not qualify after failing to <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> within 107% in the first qualifying session. However the stewards allowed him to race, having considered he was using a new chassis after an accident in Friday practice, where he had set faster lap times.|$|E
5|$|When Q3 was contested {{by the top}} ten drivers, Nico Rosberg was {{the first}} to <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> but Hamilton {{immediately}} went faster, setting a time of 1:23.397, which eventually secured him pole position. Again, both Ferrari drivers went faster than Rosberg, being about three-tenths of a second behind Hamilton. During the last timed runs, Räikkönen moved ahead of Vettel to qualify on the front row, while Rosberg improved his time, but stayed in fourth on the grid. He would later refer to his old power unit as the main reason for his qualifying performance. Nico Hülkenberg posted a time good enough for ninth, but his car came to a halt at the pit lane entrance, after his team had miscalculated the fuel put into his car. The two Williams of Massa and Bottas qualified fifth and sixth respectively, with Hülkenberg's teammate Pérez behind them in seventh, ahead of Romain Grosjean. Marcus Ericsson rounded up the top ten, but was later dropped to twelfth on the grid for impeating Hülkenberg in Q1. It was Hamilton's eleventh pole position in twelve races in the season so far.|$|E
5000|$|Pre-qualifying saw both AGSs {{eliminated}} without <b>setting</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> Yannick Dalmas withdrawing {{due to a}} wrist injury {{suffered in}} testing and Gabriele Tarquini losing fuel pressure on his first lap, while Giacomelli <b>set</b> <b>a</b> lap <b>time</b> of 7:16.2, <b>an</b> average of just over 22 mph, after the Life became stuck in third gear.
