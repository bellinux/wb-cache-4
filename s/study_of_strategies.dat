While the former work focuses on the ancient Greek and Roman world of the Mediterranean Sea, the latter work also contains chapters on such rare topics as Viking and medieval naval warfare. Rodgers was primarily a military historian who described battles and tactics, but his works also derive principles of naval warfare in the ancient and medieval worlds, and contain some detailed descriptions of archeological finds and commentary on the limitations of materials and the design of ancient and medieval naval vessels.|$|R

However, recent critiques appear to have left ANT in a gloomy theoretical black box. What is the likelihood of ANT exiting its current theoretical discontent?

However, this article will argue that by focusing on strategy as messy and impure, ANT can be afforded the opportunity to shift from a fixed approach to an ambiguous and contingent strategy, well placed to carry on. The article achieves such an argument by first highlighting how ANT has contributed to a recent <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>strategy</b> in action; second, by outlining the strategic aspects of ANT; and third, by using the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>strategy</b> in action as a means of engaging with ANT’s current theoretical discontent...|$|R
