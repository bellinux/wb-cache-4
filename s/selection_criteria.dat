5|$|The Selle Français is {{generally}} bay or chestnut in color, {{the latter being}} a legacy of its origins in the Anglo-Norman breed. Gray is much less common, with its origins in the Thoroughbred and Anglo-Arabian horses {{that contributed to the}} breed. White markings, such as white on the lower legs, are fairly common within the breed, and are again inherited from its Norman ancestors. The temperament of the Selle Français is highly variable from one horse to another. This is due to the <b>selection</b> <b>criteria</b> for breeding stock, which {{since the beginning of the}} breed have been based on physical ability. In recent years, however, the ANSF and breeders have been working to create <b>selection</b> <b>criteria</b> that focus on temperament. The vast majority of Selle Français have good temperaments, quiet but energetic, patient and friendly. The breed is reputed to be intelligent and quick to learn.|$|E
5|$|EU {{legislation}} {{makes no}} provision for the preservation and protection of breed types, which, {{in the case of}} Limousins, have been maintained and the breed developed through a rigorously enforced breed standard for over a century. An attempt to protect the integrity of the French Limousin Herd Book by opposing the entry of foreign purebreds that may have been subject to less stringent <b>selection</b> <b>criteria</b> is prohibited under EU legislation because it is considered to hinder intra-Community trade. Current EU legislation with its focus on free trade thus has the potential to result in the dilution of purebred breeds and loss of efficiency gains arising from crossbreeding.|$|E
5|$|After high school, Shoup {{attended}} DePauw University {{where he}} was one of 100 awarded the Edward Rector Scholarship, giving him full tuition. Majoring in mathematics, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity and maintained high marks, narrowly failing the <b>selection</b> <b>criteria</b> for Phi Beta Kappa Society. He was on the track and field and rifle teams, and also competed in the wrestling and football teams. He won the Indiana and Kentucky Amateur Athletic Union marathon in 1925. He waited tables, washed dishes and worked in a cement factory to help pay his expenses. Lack of funds compelled him to take a year off after his junior year to teach school, and his expenses were further strained when he contracted a severe case of pneumonia and incurred hospital bills. He opted to enroll in the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) to offset his living expenses, and later recalled that this was the only reason he joined the military. He graduated from DePauw in 1926.|$|E

Experiments for identification of 14 environmental sounds are carried out using model <b>selection</b> <b>criterion</b> as distance metric. For environmental sounds detection the decision is based on mutual similarity of compared events to the set of reference events. For audio events recognition Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is also tested. Approximately 500 audio segments from 14 sound types are used in the recognition test. The experiments show that the applications of model <b>selection</b> <b>criterion</b> for direct audio search, unsupervised environmental sounds analysis and sounds recognition using LSI are effective and accurate...|$|R

Of these four sites, Škocjan Caves and the Primeval Beech Forests are natural sites while the other two are cultural sites, as determined by the organization's <b>selection</b> <b>criteria.</b>|$|E
5|$|Enthusiasts {{worked to}} reorient the breed towards driving and {{recreation}} pursuits, and since 1982 have again reorganized the breed association. In 1992, a new studbook {{was created for}} the breed, with new <b>selection</b> <b>criteria</b> designed to preserve {{the quality of the}} breed, particularly its gaits. The latest editions of the breed registry and studbook are controlled by the Syndicat national des éleveurs et utilisateurs de chevaux Cob normand (SNEUCCN, National Union of Farmers and Users of Normandy Cob Horses), based in Tessy-sur-Vire. The association works to preserve and promote the breed throughout France, focusing especially on Normandy, Vendee and Anjou. In 1994, Normandy contained 2000 Percheron and Norman Cob horses, and annually bred around 600 foals of these two breeds. This included approximately half of the Norman Cobs bred in France.|$|E
5|$|Leeman Bennett, {{the former}} {{head coach of the}} Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, served as {{chairman}} of the selection committee, which had the task of picking the best teams from those made available by the <b>selection</b> <b>criteria</b> set by the two conferences. The committee would have approximately onemonth to select the twoteams that would attract the most people to the game and generate the largest possible television audience. This fact helped eliminate ACC runner-up Georgia Tech from the selection process, as the Yellow Jackets had already played Georgia earlier in the season, thus making a potential Georgia-Georgia Tech showdown less attractive. In addition, that matchup, while attractive to football fans in the Atlanta area (the site of the Chick-fil-A Bowl and home to Georgia Tech), would have less appeal to television viewers outside the Georgia area. Supervising the selection committee was the Chick-fil-A Bowl Executive Committee, which consisted of representatives from various Atlanta businesses and the Chick-fil-A corporation.|$|E

40|$|Process {{modeling}} {{by means}} of Gaussian-based algorithms often suffers from redundant information which usually increases the estimation computational complexity without significantly improving the estimation performance. In this article, a non-arbitrary measurement <b>selection</b> <b>criterion</b> for Gaussian-based algorithms is proposed. The measurement <b>selection</b> <b>criterion</b> {{is based on the}} determination of the most significant measurement from both an estimation convergence perspective and the covariance matrix associated with the measurement. The <b>selection</b> <b>criterion</b> is independent from the nature of the measured variable. This criterion is used in conjunction with three Gaussian-based algorithms: the EIF (Extended Information Filter), the EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) and the UKF (Unscented Kalman Filter). Nevertheless, the measurement <b>selection</b> <b>criterion</b> shown herein can also be applied to other Gaussian-based algorithms. Although this work is focused on environment modeling, the results shown herein can be applied to other Gaussian-based algorithm implementations. Mathematical descriptions and implementation results that validate the proposal are also included in this work...|$|R
5|$|The {{advent of}} {{mechanization}} threatened all French draft breeds, and while many draft breeders turned their production towards the meat market, Norman Cob breeders instead crossed their horses with Thoroughbreds {{to contribute to}} the fledgling Selle Francais breed, now France's national saddle horse. This allowed the Norman Cob to remain relatively the same through the decades, while other draft breeds were growing heavier and slower due to selection for meat. Between the 1970s and 1990s, the studbook went through several changes, and in the 1980s, genetic studies were performed that showed the breed suffered from inbreeding and genetic drift. Breed enthusiasts worked to develop new <b>selection</b> <b>criteria</b> for breeding stock, and population numbers are now relatively stable. Today, Norman Cobs are mainly found in the departments of Manche, Calvados and Orne.|$|E
5|$|The {{justification}} for the closure of Loring was that the Air Force had six more strategic bases than were needed to support the number of bomber and tanker aircraft in the Defense Department's Structure Plan. The base was evaluated against eight <b>selection</b> <b>criteria</b> {{and a large number}} of subelements specific to Air Force bases and missions. Even though Loring was in good condition and had strong community support, it ranked low in the criteria when compared to twenty other bases in the strategic category. One of the things that hurt Loring was its limited peacetime value as a tanker base, as well as its distance from bombing ranges. The commission did note that the facilities at Loring were above average, and the cost to close Loring would be low, the latter of which contributed to its closure.|$|E
5|$|The Selle Français is a French sport horse, now {{recognized}} internationally {{as a top}} breed for show jumping and three-day eventing. <b>Selection</b> <b>criteria</b> for breeding stock focuses on their jumping abilities. Show jumping is a technical sport, calling for lively and responsive yet powerful horses. Horses with more Thoroughbred blood in them have also been very competitive in three-day eventing, where speed and stamina are needed {{to be successful in}} all three portions (dressage, three-day eventing and show jumping) of the event. Thanks to these qualities, the Selle Français is seen on international show jumping and three-day eventing teams, both in France and elsewhere. In dressage, the Selle Français has gradually improved, but has faced stiff competition from northern European breeds, which often have more active gaits. In addition, many French breeders guide their horses to the more popular and profitable sport of show jumping, which sometimes deprives the dressage system of good horses. The World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses (WBFSH) ranks warmblood stud books based on their success in eventing, show jumping and dressage. In 2013, the ANSF was ranked as the 3rd best show jumping stud book in the world, topped only by the Dutch Warmblood and Belgian Warmblood breeds, and a Selle Français horse was ranked first in the world. The stud book was ranked at 6th in the world in eventing, with the top horse placed at 25th. The ANSF was ranked 19th in dressage, beaten by many of the more popular dressage breeds, including Dutch Warmbloods, Hanoverians and Westphalians.|$|E

40|$|Many machine {{learning}} algorithms can be formulated as the minimization of a training criterion which involves a hyper-parameter.

In the case of a quadratic training criterion, the gradient of the <b>selection</b> <b>criterion</b> with respect to the hyper-parameters is efficiently computed by back-propagating through a Cholesky decomposition. In the more general case, we show that the implicit function theorem can be used to derive a formula for the hyper-parameter gradient involving second derivatives of the training criterion. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new motor parameter imagery paradigm using clench speed and clench force motor imagery. The time-frequency-phase features are extracted from mu rhythm and beta rhythms, and the features are optimized using three process methods: no-scaled feature using "MIFS" feature <b>selection</b> <b>criterion,</b> scaled feature using "MIFS" feature <b>selection</b> <b>criterion,</b> and scaled feature using "mRMR" feature <b>selection</b> <b>criterion.</b> Support vector machines (SVMs) and extreme learning machines (ELMs) are compared for classification between clench speed and clench force motor imagery using the optimized feature. Our results show that {{no significant difference in}} the classification rate between SVMs and ELMs is found. The scaled feature combinations can get higher classification accuracy than the no-scaled feature combinations at significant level of 0. 01, and the "mRMR" feature <b>selection</b> <b>criterion</b> can get higher classification rate than the "MIFS" feature <b>selection</b> <b>criterion</b> at significant level of 0. 01. The time-frequency-phase feature can improve the classification rate by about 20 % more than the time-frequency feature, and the best classification rate between clench speed motor imagery and clench force motor imagery is 92 %. In conclusion, the motor parameter imagery paradigm has the potential to increase the direct control commands for BCI control and the time-frequency-phase feature has the ability to improve BCI classification accuracy.

40|$|In this report, we {{consider}} whether statistical regularities in natural images might be exploited {{to provide an}} improved <b>selection</b> <b>criterion</b> for interest points. One approach that has been particularly influential in this domain, is the Harris corner detector. The impetus for the <b>selection</b> <b>criterion</b> for Harris corners, proposed in early work and which remains in use to this day, {{is based on an}} intuitive mathematical definition constrained by the need for computational parsimony. In this report, we revisit this <b>selection</b> <b>criterion</b> free of the computational constraints that existed 20 years ago, and also importantly, taking advantage of the regularities observed in natural image statistics. Based on the motivating factors of stability and richness of structure, a selection threshold for Harris corners is proposed that is optimal with respect to the structure observed in natural images. Following the protocol proposed by Mikolajczyk et al. miko 2005 we demonstrate that the proposed approach produces interest points that are more stable across various image deformations and are more distinctive resulting in improved matching scores. Finally, the proposal may be shown to generalize to provide an improved <b>selection</b> <b>criterion</b> for other types of interest points. As a whole, the report affords an improved <b>selection</b> <b>criterion</b> for Harris corners which might foreseeably benefit any system that employs Harris corners as a constituent component, and additionally presents a general strategy for the selection of interest points based on any measure of local image structure...|$|R
