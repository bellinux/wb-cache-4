40|$|Asbestos free solid motor {{internal}} insulation samples were recently tested at the MSFC Hyperthermal Arc Jet Facility. Objectives {{of the test}} were to gather data for solid rocket motor analog characterization of ablative and in-depth thermal performance of rubber materials subject to high enthalpy/pressure flow conditions. Tests were conducted over a range of convective heat fluxes for both inert and chemically reactive sub-sonic free stream gas flow. Active instrumentation included use of total calorimeters, in-depth thermocouples, and a <b>surface</b> <b>pyrometer</b> for in-situ surface temperature measurement. Post-test sample forensics involved determination of eroded depth, charred depth, total sample weight loss, and documentation of the general condition of the eroded profile. A complete Charring Material Ablator (CMA) style aero thermal analysis was conducted for the test matrix and results compared to the measured data. In general, comparisons were possible {{for a number of}} the cases and the results show a limited predictive ability to model accurately both the ablative response and the in-depth temperature profiles. Lessons learned and modeling recommendations are made regarding future testing and modeling improvements that will increase understanding of the basic chemistry/physics associated with the complicated material ablation process of rubber materials...|$|E

40|$|A {{steady-state}} laser {{heat flux}} technique {{has been developed}} at the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field to obtain critical thermal conductivity data of ceramic thermal barrier coatings under the temperature and thermal gradients that are realistically expected to be encountered in advanced engine systems. In this study, thermal conductivity change kinetics of a plasma-sprayed, 254 -mm-thick ZrO 2 - 8 wt % Y 2 O 3 ceramic coating were obtained at high temperatures. During the testing, the temperature gradients across the coating system were carefully measured by the <b>surface</b> and back <b>pyrometers</b> and an embedded miniature thermocouple in the substrate. The actual heat flux passing through the coating system was determined from the metal substrate temperature drop (measured by the embedded miniature thermocouple and the back pyrometer) combined with one-dimensional heat transfer models...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{barrier and}} {{environmental}} barrier coatings (TBC's and EBC's) {{have been developed}} to protect metallic and Si-based ceramic components in gas turbine engines from high temperature attack. Zirconia-yttria based oxides and (Ba,Sr) Al 2 Si 2 O 8 (BSAS) /mullite based silicates have been used as the coating materials. In this study, thermal conductivity values of zirconia-yttria- and BSAS/mullite-based coating materials were determined at high temperatures using a steady-state laser heat flux technique. During the laser conductivity test, the specimen surface was heated by delivering uniformly distributed heat flux from a high power laser. One-dimensional steady-state heating was achieved by using thin disk specimen configuration (25. 4 mm diam and 2 to 4 mm thickness) and the appropriate backside air-cooling. The temperature gradient across the specimen thickness was carefully measured by two <b>surface</b> and backside <b>pyrometers.</b> The thermal conductivity values were thus determined as a function of temperature based on the 1 -D heat transfer equation. The radiation heat loss and laser absorption corrections of the materials were considered in the conductivity measurements. The effects of specimen porosity and sintering on measured conductivity values were also evaluated...|$|R
30|$|Given {{their lower}} cost as {{compared}} to thermocouples, pyrometers predicted MEAN and MAX (as measured by the thick thermocouples) relatively well, explaining 60 to 82 % of the variation of these metrics. The fact we used the thicker thermocouples as the reference for comparison in this study underestimates the degree of inaccuracy of pyrometers in detecting maximum temperatures. We found tile pyrometers to be less accurate than metal pyrometers due to the insulating affect of the ceramic tiles. This insulating affect is particularly noticeable if the flame front approaches the tile pyrometer on the face opposite the painted surface. The water in our metal pyrometer/calorimeters absorbed heat creating an insulating affect as well, although this effect was less than that caused by the ceramic tiles. A significant drawback {{to the use of}} pyrometers is the inconsistent behavior of paints and the subjective interpretation of melted paints. Some paints melted poorly, even at temperatures above their designed melting point. Charring of the <b>pyrometer</b> <b>surface</b> made paints difficult to read. And, paints behaved differently on different material (e.g., soaked into porous ceramic, dripped on metal). These limitations, and the influence of pyrometer construction material, make comparison of pyrometer results across studies questionable.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Welding on {{in-service}} pipelines (hot tapping) {{has been}} prac-ticed {{for many years}} on pipes containing both liquids and gases. The increasing frequency of sour conditions within gas and oil pipelines increases the risks in-volved in welding on pressure-contain-ing lines and imposes additional re-straints {{in the form of}} maximum tolerable hardness, especially in the heat-affected zone (HAZ). While there are existing pro-cedures to deal with the cooling rate ef-fects of the liquid or gas contained within a pipeline, little is known {{of the effects of the}} physical properties of the liquid or gas on the cooling rates to be expected. Most experimental work on procedure verification has been done on still or cir-culating water as the working fluid. In this study, a pressurized test coupon of X- 52 -type pipe was filled with liquids of differing physical properties — water, ethylene glycol, methanol, water-glycol mixtures and water-methanol mixtures. Thermocouples monitored inside wall-temperature changes caused by mecha-nized GTAW autogenous fusion runs on the pipe <b>surface,</b> and optical <b>pyrometer</b> measurements were used to assess out-side wall temperature cycles. The results show both the working fluid physical properties and the pipe pressure conditions affect the weld zone cooling rate to a significant degree. It is possible to control cooling rates on the inside and outside walls of the pipe by adjusting working fluid properties and in-ternal pressure conditions. Low-hydrogen SMAW deposits were compared to the autogenous GTAW runs for limited but practical repair procedural conditions. This showed the expected heat input increase due to more efficient SMAW arc conditions is about 25 %. This difference is somewhat lower than the usual GTAW/SMAW arc efficiency com-parisons in the literature. It indicates the necessity for more trials incorporating the range of welding process parameters to be considered in evaluating the work-ing fluid cooling characteristics. Once the heat input relationships for various processes are established, the cooling rate control possible with various working fluid compositions can be uti-lized to assess procedure qualification in a controlled engineering environment. A procedure qualification involving the modified water-ethylene glycol working fluid has been used to make a nozzle to pipe weld on an active sour gas pipeline during the Canadian winter...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} fuel cost and environmental targets, the demand for more efficient gas turbines has risen considerably in the last decade. One {{of the most important}} systems in a gas turbine is the secondary air system, which provides cooling air to the disks and to the blades. It also provides air for sealing of the bearing chambers. The amount of secondary air that is extracted from the compressor is a performance penalty for the engine. In aero engines, bearing chambers are in most cases sealed by the most traditional type of seal, the labyrinth seal. Bearing chambers contain the oil lubricated components like bearings and gears. In order to avoid oil migration from the bearing chamber into the turbomachinery, the seals are pressurized by secondary air; thus, a pressure difference is setup across the seal, which retains the lubricant into the bearing chamber. Oil loss can lead to a number of problems like oil fire or coking with the probability of an uncontained destruction of the aero engine. Oil fumes can also cause contamination of the air conditioning system of the aircraft thus cause discomfort to the passengers. Beside labyrinth seals, other types of seals such as brush seals and carbon seals are used. Both the latter are contact type seals, that is, they may be installed with zero gap and lift during operation when they get pressurized. Brush seals particularly may be installed having an overlap with the rotating part. An original aero engine bearing chamber was modified by MTU Aero Engines to run with brush seals in a simulating rig in Munich. Two types of brush seals were used for testing: (a) a brush seal with bristles made of Kevlar fibers and (b) a brush seal with bristles made of steel. Both types were installed with an overlap to the rotor. The targets set were twofold: (a) to measure the transient temperatures in the rotor and particularly in the contact zone between the bristles and the rotor and (b) to calculate the heat generation by the seals which could enable predictions of the heat generation in future applications (i. e. scaling to bigger rotor diameters). For the heat transfer calculations, numerical models using ANSYS CFX were created. Additionally, a coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA) approach was applied to simulate flow and bristle's behavior. In order to obtain the transient temperature measurements with high fidelity, a new pyrometric technique was developed and was applied {{for the first time in}} brush seals as reported by Flouros et al. (2013, "Transient Temperature Measurements in the Contact Zone Between Brush Seals of Kevlar and Metallic Type for Bearing Chamber Sealing Using a Pyrometric Technique," ASME J. Gas Turbines Power, 135 (8), p. 081603) and Flouros et al. (2012, "Transient Temperature Measurements in the Contact Zone Between Brush Seals of Kevlar and Metallic Type for Bearing Chamber Sealing Using a Pyrometric Technique," ASME Turbo Expo 2012, Copenhagen, Paper No. GT 2012 - 68354). This technique has enabled positioning of the pyrometer (SensorthermGmbH, www. sensortherm. com) into the bristles pack of the seal adjacent to the rotating <b>surface.</b> The <b>pyrometer</b> could record the frictional temperature evolution in the bristles/rotor contact zone during accelerations or decelerations of the rotor. The sealing air demand can be reduced up to 97 % with brush seals compared to traditional three fin labyrinth. It has been estimated that this can result in a reduction in fuel burned up to 1 %. Further, the reduction in air flow has additional potential benefits such as a possible simplification of the bearing chamber architecture (vent less chamber). Even though the rotor was accelerated up to 19, 500 rpm, the temperature induced overshoots in the seal/rotor contact zone have caused no deterioration in either the materials or the oil.

40|$|The {{practice}} of burning large acreages of forest {{lands in the}} West for the reduction of fuel hazards is currently accepted by certain land management agencies. Although these prescribed burns frequently accomplish their objectives, {{little attention has been}} given to the possible effects these have on watershed conditions. In Arizona, where the demand for water is increasing each year, and where large burning programs are in effect, the influences of burning on water infiltration into the soil is of particular importance. Literature on burning and infiltration relationships is inconclusive. Detrimental and beneficial effects to soils and infiltration capacities have been reported. During the summer of 1963, four sites were selected in the ponderosa pine region of east central Arizona. This study area was located five miles east of McNary on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, where a large prescribed burning program has been underway since 1948. In July, a light burn and a heavy burn treatment, which approximated prescribed burning and wildfire conditions, respectively, were conducted on each of the four sites. Temperatures during treatments were measured with fusion <b>pyrometers.</b> <b>Surface</b> soil temperatures for the light burns did not exceed 200 °F. Maximum temperatures at the soil surface for heavy burns ranged from 350 °F. to 550 °F. An infiltrometer plot, one by four feet in size, was installed {{in the center of each}} treatment area (unburned control, light burn, and heavy burn) on each site. A modified North Fork infiltrometer with constant head tank was utilized to conduct infiltration measurements. The twelve infiltrometer plots remained in place for 25 months, through two overwintering periods. Two infiltration runs were conducted on each plot in late summer,. 1963, and three series of runs were made in both the summers of 1964 and 1965. Infiltration curves were plotted for each run from runoff data programmed into a computer and incremental digital plotter. Infiltration capacity values were obtained directly from these curves. Light and heavy burns produced highly significant decreases in infiltration capacities immediately following burning. No statistically significant differences due to burning were detected between the burning treatments and controls during the second and third summers. It was concluded that the burning programs conducted in late fall on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, when followed by an overwintering period with freezing and thawing conditions, cause no appreciable effect on watershed conditions. Additional results showed that nearly all the 96 infiltration curves plotted exhibited a pronounced dip after five to fifteen minutes of water application. Soil wettability or a resistance to wetting is felt to be an important factor in causing this depression; however, the extent and practical significance of this new phenomenon is uncertain. Increases in soil pH, carbon, and total nitrogen percentages for the surface two inches of soil were detected immediately following light and heavy burning treatments. These increases were still evident two years after treatment but to a lesser extent. A statistically significant increase in the bulk density of the surface one inch of soil, which was found immediately after burning, was not found after one overwintering period. Changes in the physical and chemical properties of the silt loam soils in the study area following burning were considered to be negligible...|$|R
