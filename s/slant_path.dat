40|$|Remote sensing of {{the amount}} of water vapor along the <b>slant</b> <b>path</b> using the ground-base GPS is the basis of getting the {{three-dimensional}} distribution (water vapor tomography) of water vapor in the immediate vicinity of the site. The principle of remote sensing of water vapor along the <b>slant</b> <b>path</b> using GPS is described in this paper. First, the nonisotropic component of water vapor in different azimuth above the GPS receiver is calculated using the wet gradient and the post-fit residuals, and then <b>slant</b> <b>path</b> water vapor is recreated. In order to prove the accuracy of CPS observation, water vapor radiometers (WVR) were used to observe together with GPS. Comparison between WVR and GPS observations at different sites and times shows that root-mean-square error is less than 4 mm. Therefore, the <b>slant</b> <b>path</b> water vapor amount can be accurately retrieved using this method, which is suited for nearly real-time remote sensing and detection of the atmosphere. Ground-base GPS measurements of water vapor have the advantage of all-weather continued observations.

40|$|Water vapor {{plays an}} {{important}} role in meteorological applications; GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) therefore developed a tomographic system to derive 3 -D distributions of the tropospheric water vapor above Germany using GPS data from about 300 ground stations. Input data for the tomographic reconstructions are generated by the Earth Parameter and Orbit determination System (EPOS) software of the GFZ, which provides zenith total delay (ZTD), integrated water vapor (IWV) and slant total delay (STD) data operationally with a temporal resolution of 2. 5 min (STD) and 15 min (ZTD, IWV). The water vapor distribution in the atmosphere is derived by tomographic reconstruction techniques. The quality of the solution is dependent on many factors such as the spatial coverage of the atmosphere with <b>slant</b> <b>paths,</b> the spatial distribution of their intersections and the accuracy of the input observations. Independent observations are required to validate the tomographic reconstructions and to get precise information on the accuracy of the derived 3 -D water vapor fields. To determine the quality of the GPS tomography, more than 8000 vertical water vapor profiles at 13 German radiosonde stations were used for the comparison. The radiosondes were launched twice a day (at 00 : 00 UTC and 12 : 00 UTC) in 2007.
