Ancient monuments were {{one of the most important}} factors determining the placing of the dead in the early Anglo-Saxon landscape. Anglo-Saxon <b>secondary</b> <b>activity</b> on prehistoric and Roman sites was traditionally explained in practical terms. These explanations, in the view of Howard Williams, failed to account for the numbers and types of monuments and graves (from villas to barrows) reused.|$|E

30|$|For simplicity, and {{consistently}} with {{the practice in}} labour market statistics, our estimates consider only primary activities. In time use data, the identification of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>activities</b> is left to respondents. This may introduce some heterogeneity in the data, as the relevance of <b>secondary</b> <b>activities</b> can vary according to household specific arrangements, individual preferences, individual effort, and also by country, as a result of different institutions or cultural values. As we focus on total OUP work, the misclassification of activities between primary and secondary affects our estimates only when one activity is performed for {{the market and the}} other one for own use. We do not control for these cases. Accounting for <b>secondary</b> <b>activities</b> is left for future research.|$|R

25|$|Eruptive {{activity}} {{itself could}} continue for years, followed {{by years of}} decreasing <b>secondary</b> <b>activity.</b> Volcanic ash would most likely spread throughout the Pacific Northwest, causing airports to be closed and relevant flights to be diverted or cancelled. The associated ash column would then extend eastward by the prevailing winds and disrupt air traffic throughout Canada from Alberta to Newfoundland and Labrador. The cooling lava would discontinuously spall units to create pyroclastic flows (super-heated mix of gas, ash, and pumice). The loose volcanic rock and pyroclastic material on Cayley's flanks and in valleys would be periodically reactivated into debris flows. Considerable structural improvements {{would have to be}} made to reclaim use of Highway 99 and Squamish area.|$|E
2500|$|Cassar {{called the}} battle a British {{tactical}} success {{but that the}} strategic intentions had not been met. Sheldon was less complimentary and wrote that although the attack had shocked the German army, it quickly amended its defensive tactics and that the British had also been shocked, that such a carefully planned attack had collapsed after the first day. Sheldon called the British analysis of the battle [...] "bluster" [...] and wrote that Joseph Joffre, the French commander, praised {{the results of the}} first day, then dismissed the significance of the attack [...] "" [...] (But it was a success which led to nothing.) The German and French armies began to revise their low opinion of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), the Germans having assumed that the British would remain on the defensive to release French troops and had taken the risk of maintaining as few troops as possible opposite the British. The German defences were hurriedly strengthened and more troops brought in to garrison them. The French had also expected that the British troops would only release French soldiers from trench-holding and that British participation in French attacks would be a <b>secondary</b> <b>activity.</b> After the battle French commanders made more effort to co-operate with the BEF and plan a combined attack from Arras to Armentières.|$|E

More recently, considerations of concurrent (or <b>secondary)</b> <b>activities</b> have been used to highlight the full social extent of childcare, and to show that mothers work disproportionately long hours. This paper addresses a blind spot in such studies: the domestic usefulness - or otherwise - of teenage children. It examines how measurements of <b>secondary</b> <b>activities</b> in Australian time use surveys contribute to understanding of the division of household, caring and total productive work between parents and teenagers. In this way, the paper addresses a recent call by youth studies scholars to &# 039;bring the family back into focus&# 039;. We found that <b>secondary</b> <b>activities</b> accentuate already inequitable division of labour between mothers, fathers, daughters and sons. However, the results were not uniform, and show that a minority of teenagers shoulder substantial domestic responsibilities. The paper concludes by arguing that teenagers need to be included, conceptually as well as practically, in considerations of sustainable and equitable divisions of household and caring work...|$|R

The characteristic of processes as spanning the white space on the organization chart indicates that processes are embedded in some form of organizational structure. Also, a process can be cross-functional, i.e. it ranges over several business functions.|$|R
