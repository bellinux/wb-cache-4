5|$|Such {{savings and}} loan {{associations}} had been deregulated in the early 1980s, allowing them to make highly risky investments with their depositors' money. Keating and other {{savings and loan}} operators took advantage of this deregulation. <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> established connections to many members of Congress, by supplying them with needed funds for campaigns through legal donations. Lincoln's particular investments {{took the form of}} buying land, taking equity positions in real estate development projects, and buying high-yield junk bonds.|$|E

The latter was established after the <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> crisis of the 1980s. The existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks' attempting to shift from one fund to another, depending on the benefits each could provide. In the 1990s, SAIF premiums were, at one point, five times higher than BIF premiums; several banks attempted {{to qualify for the}} BIF, with some merging with institutions qualified for the BIF to avoid the higher premiums of the SAIF. This drove up the BIF premiums as well, resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary.|$|E

25|$|In many countries, banks {{or similar}} {{financial}} institutions {{are the primary}} originators of mortgages. For banks that are funded from customer deposits, the customer deposits will typically have much shorter terms than residential mortgages. If a bank were to offer large volumes of mortgages at fixed rates but to derive most of its funding from deposits (or other short-term sources of funds), the bank would have an asset–liability mismatch due to interest rate risk: in this case, it would be running {{the risk that the}} interest income from its mortgage portfolio would be less than it needed to pay its depositors. In the United States, some argue that {{the savings and loan crisis}} was in part caused by this problem, that the <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> companies had short-term deposits and long-term, fixed rate mortgages, and were caught when Paul Volcker raised interest rates in the early 1980s. Therefore, banks and other financial institutions offer adjustable rate mortgages because it reduces risk and matches their sources of funding.|$|E
