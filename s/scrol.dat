40|$|Abstract—Establishing {{semantic}} interoperability among heterogeneous information sources {{has been a}} critical issue in the database community {{for the past two}} decades. Despite the critical importance, current approaches to {{semantic interoperability}} of heterogeneous databases have not been sufficiently effective. We propose a common ontology called Semantic Conflict Resolution Ontology (<b>SCROL)</b> that addresses the inherent difficulties in the conventional approaches, i. e., federated schema and domain ontology approaches. <b>SCROL</b> provides a systematic method for automatically detecting and resolving various semantic conflicts in heterogeneous databases. <b>SCROL</b> provides a dynamic mechanism of comparing and manipulating contextual knowledge of each information source, which is useful in achieving semantic interoperability among heterogeneous databases. We show how <b>SCROL</b> is used for detecting and resolving semantic conflicts between semantically equivalent schema and data elements. In addition, we present evaluation results to show that <b>SCROL</b> can be successfully used to automate the process of identifying and resolving semantic conflicts. Index Terms—Heterogeneous databases, ontology, semantic conflict resolution, semantic modeling. æ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an adaptive agent-based framework for knowledge sharing. The framework supports semantic-based knowledge retrieval and filtering through {{the usage of}} ontologies, case-based reasoning, and genetic algorithms. First, the concept of ontologies is applied to build users ’ profiles and resolve semantic conflicts among multiple knowledge sources – User Profile Ontology (UPROL), Semantic Conflict Resolution Ontology (<b>SCROL),</b> and Domain ontology. UPROL {{is used by the}} profile agent to map users ’ interests into a common terminology. <b>SCROL</b> allows multiple views and interpretations of a given terminology by different users and applications. Domain ontology is also used to organize information sources and direct search processes. We also utilize collaborative filtering through case-based reasoning techniques for knowledge filtering and recommendation. Finally, by adopting the survival-of-the-fittest rule of genetic algorithms, we make the system continuously adapt to changing users ’ profiles. In conclusion, our adaptive agent-based approach allows knowledge seekers to access tacit yet interoperable knowledg...|$|E
40|$|Elegant copy of {{the short}} mas̲navī of Niʻmat Khān Shīrāzī, known as ʻĀlī (d. 1710). Origin: As appears in {{colophon}} on p. 361, copied by ʻAbd al-Rashīd al-Daylamī [?] with transcription completed in 1151 [1738 or 9]. 1151 from 151, being the more likely reading (given the author's dates, decoration, hand, etc.) of what the copyist has entered as "١٠٥١" which initially suggests 1051 [1641 or 2]. A similar practice with numerals appears in the foliation (see fol. 110 - 120 i. e. ١٠١٠ to ١٠٢٠ as entered in red ink). Date in seal impression provides very rough terminus ante quem of 1756. Accompanying materials: Half-sheet of writing paper with note in hand of G. Meredith-Owens, reads " 362 | A mas̲navī poem of ethico-religious content.

The method includes an adaptation of the <b>SCROL</b> study strategy to scaffold learning by teaching the organization of text. The method was developed to give teachers a systematic guide to use podcasts as an accommodation {{for students who are}} not able to read social studies texts at their grade level. Podcasting is a twenty-first century technology that can be utilized to grant auditory access to curriculum. Auditory texts allow a student to use their listening comprehension. This {{project is a}}lso an example of instruction that uses the Universal Design for Learning. A pilot single case research study was conducted to field-test the podcast method. The results showed that this method of recording and using a podcast can increase the comprehension scores of grade level social studies texts for students who have a history of difficulty with reading and understanding these texts...|$|E
40|$|With {{billions of}} Web pages on the World-Wide-Web (WWW) and {{millions}} of users, how to access, exchange and integrate spatial information {{is one of the}} keys to the WWW success. However, today’s web is designed for direct use by people, who must view, understand, select and navigate its information. Moreover, it is difficult to use because of the semantic conflict between data and lack of tools to allow integrated access to shared spatial information. In this paper, we present an approach by using the semantic web technology and the common ontology to help people find spatial information in an Internet-connected world. First, we introduce the semantic web, including its main concepts, such as RDF, ontology, and agents. Second, we describe Semantic Conflict Resolution Ontology (<b>SCROL),</b> which proposed by Ram and Park, to provide a systemic method for automatically detecting and resolving semantic conflicts. Third, we show how to make land use information service work on the semantic web. Finally, we have the conclusion and discuss the future work...|$|E
40|$|In the turbo machinery, {{predicting}} the vibratory {{response of the}} blade {{is one of the}} important items of the structural integrity. In this paper, simplified method utilizing the steady flow analysis was proposed for this purpose. This method was applied to predict the blade vibratory response of the radial turbine impeller against the excitation caused by scroll tongue. At first, this simplified method was compared with the method based on unsteady flow analysis to examine the validity and limitation. After that, this method was applied to predict the effect of scroll shape and operation on the blade vibration response. Some findings are obtained and comparison with experimental result shows the validity of this method for {{predicting the}} tendency, though some technical problems should be solved to achieve more correct quantitative prediction.

40|$|Synarthrophyton robbenense sp. nov. and S. munimentum sp. nov., {{the fourth}} and fifth species in this {{apparently}} southern hemisphere genus, are described from southern Africa. Synarhrophyton robbenense occurs on rock and shells in the subtidal zone. Its thalli are minutely warty, with the surface covered by short, narrow protuberances that are fused into elongate, scrolled structures. The surface [scanning electron microscopy (SEM) ] is of the Leptophytum type. Mature tetraibisporangial conceptacles have raised rims and sunken pore plates. The pore plates are composed of filaments made up of two or three cells plus an enlarged epithallial cell. The pore canal is lined by filaments with cells that do not differ in size or shape from those of the other filaments making up the pore plate. Cells of filaments within the tetrasporangial and bisporangial conceptacle rim are narrower and more elongate than cells of the pore plate and surrounding vegetative filaments. Tetralbisporangial pores are surrounded by five to eight rosette cells that tilt somewhat toward the pore in surface SEM view. Tetraibisporangial conceptacles do not become buried in the thallus, but are shed on senescence, often leaving shallow craters on the surface. Synarthrophylon munimenlum occurs on rocks and shells in low-shore tide pools, and on rock, shells, and kelp holdfasts in the subtidal zone. Thalli are usually smooth, occasionally warty, but never show protuberances that are fused into <b>scrol</b> l-like structures. The thallus surface (SEM) is made up of Leptophytum-type epithallial cells. Tetral bisporangial conceptacle roofs are volcano-shaped with a raised peripheral rim and sunken pore plate. The pore plates are composed of filaments made up of five to seven cells plus an epithallial cell. The rosette cells that surround the tetral bisporangial pore are distinct from surrounding roof cells (SEM, surface view) in being narrower and sunken below the level of the surrounding pore plate. The pore canal is lined by filaments with cells that do not differ in size or shape from those of the other filaments making up the pore plate. Cells of filaments within the tetrasporangial and bisporangial conceptacle rim are more or less similar in size and shape to cells of the pore plate and surrounding vegetative filaments.
