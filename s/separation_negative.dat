Kazuo Miyagawa, as Daiei Motion Picture Company's cameraman, invented bleach bypass for Ichikawa's film, {{inspired}} by the color rendition in the 1956 release of Moby-Dick, printed using dye-transfer Technicolor, and was achieved {{through the use of}} an additional black and white overlay. Actually, this is a throwback to pre-1944 Technicolor, which incorporated a silver-containing [...] "blank receiver" [...] with the silver image printed from the green <b>separation</b> <b>negative,</b> but at 50-percent density, upon which the color dyes were imprinted by utilizing [...] "imbibition"; this concept may have been employed here, but at a different density. Despite this early foray into the technique, it remained overlooked for the most part until its use by Roger Deakins in 1984. The effect has subsequently become a regular development tool in labwork, and has remained in widespread usage ever since. Some notable practitioners include cinematographers Rodrigo Prieto, Remi Adefarasin, Darius Khondji, Dariusz Wolski, Walter Carvalho, Oliver Stapleton, Newton Thomas Sigel, Park Gok-ji, Shane Hurlbut, Steven Soderbergh (as [...] "Peter Andrews"), Tom Stern, Vittorio Storaro, and Janusz Kamiński (notably on Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan and Minority Report).|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{examined}} psychosocial risks, {{and positive}} factors, {{in relation to}} depression and spiritual wellbeing in Taiwanese women. It also sought to replicate and extend UK-based attachment models in the Taiwanese context. Poor childhood care, unsupportive and conflictful relationships, negative self-esteem and insecure attachment style were examined in relation to models of depression. Positive aspects of such factors were examined in relation to spiritual wellbeing. Tests were performed for mediation and moderation effects involving attachment style. Relationships with birth family and family-in-Iaw, as well as religious experience, were examined as additional cultural factors which might add to the explanatory models. Method: The research utilised a cross-sectional quantitative analysis of 721 on-line questionnaires with Taiwanese women aged 18 - 55 using standardised self -report questionnaires translated into Mandarin. These were supplemented with the Attachment Style Interview on a small subset to explore {{the social context of}} experience. Results: Logistic regression confirmed that childhood poor care, thoughts of partner <b>separation,</b> <b>negative</b> self-esteem and attachment insecurity provided the best model for depression outcome in women with a partner. For single women, age under 30 and negative self-esteem alone provided the best model. There was no evidence of mediation effects. Spiritual wellbeing was modelled by having a live-in partner, positive self-esteem, and security of attachment style. limited evidence was presented for moderation effects. Case studies were used to outline the relationship and attachment experience of the Taiwanese women to look at the context of experience and cultural elements. Conclusions: Whilst the basic psychosocial models of depression derived from UK research held, differences revolved around the wider range of family relationships important in Taiwan and important differences emerged in models for women under 30 without a partner which require further research. Attachment style was shown to hold in both risk and resilience models. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{levels of}} marital {{satisfaction}} {{and how these}} were predicted by scores on the Romantic Partner Conflict Scale were assessed separately in Australian males (n = 48) and females (n = 100) and Chinese males (n = 321) and females (n = 321). Contrary to expectations, marital satisfaction was higher in the Australian sample than in the Chinese sample. However, there was a culture by gender interaction in which Australian females were much more satisfied than Chinese females. Satisfaction scores for males in both cultures were different, with males being less satisfied than females in the Australian sample and the converse in the Chinese sample with males being more satisfied than females. Scores on the Romantic Partner Conflict Scale more strongly predicted marital satisfaction in both Australian males (Radj 2 =. 43) and females (Radj 2 =. 21) than in Chinese males (Radj 2 =. 10) and females (Radj 2 =. 11). In both of the Australian male and female samples, Compromise in conflict situations was the strongest predictor in a positive direction of marital satisfaction. For females, Interactional Reactivity also entered the equation in a negative direction. For Chinese males, the strongest predictor of satisfaction was Submission (negative direction) followed by Compromise (positive direction). For Chinese females, <b>Separation</b> (<b>negative</b> direction) and Interactional Reactivity (positive direction) entered the prediction equation. These results show that how conflict is {{dealt with in the}} relationship is a much strong predictor of marital satisfaction in Australians than in Chinese and that the ability to compromise is important in both Australian sexes. In China, how conflict is dealt with is less important in marital satisfaction and the aspects of conflict handling that predict satisfaction are different to those in Australia and different between the sexes. These results indicate cross-cultural difference in the prediction of marital satisfaction between China and Australia...|$|E
40|$|The dye {{transfer}} process is the photographic printing process used to produce the highest quality photographic prints to be submitted to printers for reproduction. Dye transfer prints are valued by advertising agencies for their highly saturated colors and ease of retouching. Photographers, museums, art galleries and collectors also value dye prints for the archival qualities. Dye transfer uses cyan, magenta, and yellow dyes to reproduce a color image. Photographic masking is used extensively for color correction, tone compression, and detail enhancement. The masks are projected with the original transparency to make continuous-tone <b>separation</b> <b>negatives.</b> Shallow-reliefgelatin positive-image matrices are made by exposure from light projected through the <b>separation</b> <b>negatives.</b> The matrices carry the dyes to the paper base for printing. The techniques used to produce the masks and <b>separation</b> <b>negatives</b> are so difficult, expensive, and imprecise {{that the future of}} the process is in jeopardy. Manufacturers of electronic color prepress systems and color separation labs would like to take over the market now served by the {{dye transfer}} labs. Existing computer graphics technology, however, cannot offer the same quality and capabilities. Electronic color scanners exist to simplify the photographic methods of masking and color separation. Electronic color scanning techniques techniques have reduced the time to produce color separations for printers from eight hours to thirty minutes. The amount of film used to make separations has been greatly reduced also. Analysis of electronic color scanning techniques could result in a similar savings of time and materials for dye transfer labs. Use of scanners to produce continuous-tone <b>separation</b> <b>negatives</b> for dye transfer would open a new market for scanner manufacturers and color separation labs. A less expensive method of producing dye transfer prints could allow a greater profit margin for the dye transfer labs and make the process more affordable for photographers. An experiment was conducted to determine if acceptable first -roll dye prints could be made from continuous-tone separations produced with a scanner. Comparison of the time and amount of materials required by the conventional photographic and scanner methods were made. Four judges with {{dye transfer process}} expertise determined that no significant differences of quality existed between a group of dye transfer prints produced by a conventional color separation method and a group produced by an electronic color scanning method. The hypothesis that <b>separation</b> <b>negatives</b> produced by electronic scanning will provide acceptable dye transfer prints that require minimal use of the printing controls, with greater consistency, than <b>separation</b> <b>negatives</b> produced by conventional photographic techniques for dye transfer prints was proved correct...|$|R

This is a simple instrument made using a calibrated continuous tone negative step wedge. It was used for measuring continuous tone reference patches as used for process control of color separations, in place of an electronic densitometer. The measurements were made by a comparison between the control step wedge and the samples in close proximity over a light table. The basis for this instrument is the human eye 2 ̆ 7 s ability to differentiate between two areas of brightness in close proximity. The study involved 20 operators making visual comparisons of 22 samples that ranged between 0. 20 and 2. 04, two sets of measurements were made to determine if the surrounding light from the light table had an effect on the results.

Results for ionic distribution profiles, {{pressures of}} the confined fluid, and absorption isotherms are obtained through the hypernetted chain/mean spherical approximation (HNC/MSA) integral equations theory. In spherical and cylindrical geometries, an inward, non-monotonic behavior of the pressure is found as confinement increases, implying a negative compressibility.

30|$|The {{high-resolution}} azimuthal resistivity laterolog {{response in}} a fractured formation was numerically simulated using a three-dimensional finite element method. Simulation {{results show that}} the azimuthal resistivity is determined by fracture dipping as well as dipping direction, while the amplitude differences between deep and shallow laterolog resistivities are mainly controlled by the former. A linear relationship exists between the corrected apparent conductivities and fracture aperture. With the same fracture aperture, the deep and shallow laterolog resistivities present small values with <b>negative</b> <b>separations</b> for low-angle fractures, while azimuthal resistivities have large variations with positive separations for high-angle fractures that intersect the borehole.

40|$|Off-press {{proofing}} is {{a method}} of simulating the way a set of <b>separation</b> <b>negatives</b> or positives will look when printed {{without having to go}} to the printing press. In 1965, The Graphic Arts Technical Foundation (GATF) developed a proofing control device for production Lithography. The Standard Offset Color Control Bar was also utilized for off-press proofing. In 1983, The Graphic Communications Association, in cooperation with GATF, introduced The Off-Press Proof Comparator. This control device was designed specifically for this technology and intended to be used by both technical and non-technical personnel with equal and successful results. This thesis is concerned with the accuracy of both proofing bars using the Du Pont Cromalin system of off -press proofing to determine whether one control bar is better for judging whether a proof is made correctly to SWOP standards. It is also concerned with whether one control bar is more versatile than the other for both technical or non-technical personnel to use. The experiment consisted of a total sample population of forty experts from four different fields of the graphic arts industry. These four groups represent technical and non-technical users. Each participant was asked to look at samples of each color bar and choose which sample was made to SWOP standards. The results were applied to statistical methods of evaluation to give a final result.

Furthermore, with separation, the wholesaler may discriminate against the vertically integrated firm's retailer. Vertical separation impacts social welfare through two e¤ects.

The spin of the electrons is taken into account. Non-Fermi liquid correlations implying spin-charge separation are assumed to be present in the dot and in the leads. It is found that the energetic distance of the peaks in the linear conductance shows a spin-induced parity effect at zero temperature T. The temperature dependence of the positions of the peaks depends on the non-Fermi liquid nature of the system.
