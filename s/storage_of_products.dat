50|$|Whale oil {{was needed}} as lamp oil for illumination. It burned with a bright, {{smokeless}} flame that nothing else {{was known to}} match. Chemists had known how to make oil from coal (coal oil) or turpentine (camphene) for many years, but they burned with sooty flames, making them unsuitable for indoor illumination. The only viable competitor to whale oil was “burning oil,” a mixture of camphene and alcohol, which burned bright and smokeless, but which was volatile and prone to explode. Fire insurance policies charged higher premiums for buildings in which camphene-based lamp oil was used. The city of Lowell, Massachusetts banned the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> containing camphene within 200 yards of any building in the city.|$|E
50|$|Pallets can {{be stored}} using single- and double-deep racks {{when the number of}} units per item is small, while pallet-flow and {{push-back}} racks are used when the units per item are mid-range, and floor-storage or drive-in racks are used when the number of units per item is large, with drive-in providing support for pallet loads that cannot be stacked on top of each other.

The project comprised six stages with the first three stages being part of the development and evaluation <b>of</b> a new <b>storage</b> and picking technology.

The simulation activities within this second part started with classical planning simulation and covered the emulation of the real-world control software, the support of the system ramp-up, and finally the implementation of a permanent test base in order to evaluate necessary software changes. The article describes the storage and picking technology, the stages of the simulation project and the benefits of both, the technology itself and the extensive simulation application. ...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, many {{distribution}} networks {{deal with}} the distribution and storage of perishable products. However, distribution network design models are largely based on assumptions that do not consider time limitations for the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> within the network. This study develops {{a model for the}} design of a distribution network that considers the short lifetime of perishable products. The model simultaneously determines the network configuration and inventory control decisions of the network. Moreover, as the lifetime is strictly dependent on the storage conditions, the model develops a trade-off between enhancing storage conditions (higher inventory cost) to obtain a longer lifetime and selecting those storage conditions that lead to shorter lifetimes (less inventory cost). To solve the model, an efficient Lagrangian relaxation heuristic algorithm is developed. The model and algorithm are validated by sensitivity analysis on some key parameters. Results show that the algorithm finds optimal or near optimal solutions even for large-size cases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Warehousing is {{commonly}} used in factories for the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> until delivery of orders. As the amount of products stored increases it becomes tedious {{to be carried out}} manually. In recent years, the manual storing has converted into fully or partially computer controlled systems, also known as Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (AS/RS). This paper discusses an ASRS system, which was designed such that the best storage location for the products is determined by utilizing a fuzzy control system. The design maintains the records of the products to be/already in store and the storage/retrieval times along with the availability status of the storage locations. This paper discusses on the maintenance of the above mentioned records and the utilization of the concept of fuzzy logic {{in order to determine the}} optimum storage location for the products. The paper will further discuss on the dynamic splitting and merging of the storage locations depending on the product sizes.

40|$|In a batch process, either {{direct or}} {{indirect}} heat integration may be employed. The former involves direct heat transfer from hot to cold process streams. In the latter, heat from a hot process stream is first transferred to an intermediate fluid where the heat is stored until it is finally transferred to a cold stream. <b>Storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> streams allows direct heat integration to be delayed, thereby providing an opportunity for energy conservation while avoiding {{the use of an}} intermediate fluid. This paper presents a new methodology for batch heat integration that involves the direct <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> streams within the procedure to set the minimum utility targets. Application of the proposed methodology on illustrative examples demonstrates that significant energy reduction can be achieved by shifting product streams on the time scale. Potential reductions of 33. 2 % cold utility and 45. 1 % hot utility were estimated for the first example when the product stream was stored. Similarly, reductions of 3. 5 % cold utility and 6. 5 % hot utility were observed for a two-product batch plant when the cooling requirement for one <b>of</b> the <b>products</b> was shifted on time scale.
