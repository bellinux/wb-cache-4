25|$|Electronic {{switching}} systems gradually evolved in stages from electromechanical hybrids with <b>stored</b> <b>program</b> {{control to the}} fully digital systems. Early systems used reed relay-switched metallic paths under digital control. Equipment testing, phone numbers reassignments, circuit lockouts and similar tasks were accomplished by data entry on a terminal.|$|E
25|$|Bell System {{installations}} typically had alarm bells, gongs, or chimes {{to announce}} alarms {{calling attention to}} a failed switch element. A trouble reporting card system was connected to switch common control elements. These trouble reporting systems punctured cardboard cards with a code that logged {{the nature of a}} failure. Reed relay technology in <b>stored</b> <b>program</b> control exchange finally quieted the environment.|$|E
25|$|Designing {{the visual}} {{composition}} and temporal {{behavior of a}} GUI {{is an important part}} of software application programming in the area of human–computer interaction. Its goal is to enhance the efficiency and ease of use for the underlying logical design of a <b>stored</b> <b>program,</b> a design discipline named usability. Methods of user-centered design are used to ensure that the visual language introduced in the design is well-tailored to the tasks.|$|E

25|$|After {{clearing}} the launch tower, a flight program {{stored in the}} launch vehicle digital computer (LVDC) commanded a roll of the vehicle to orient {{it so that the}} subsequent pitch maneuver pointed the vehicle in the desired azimuth. The roll and pitch commands were controlled by the <b>stored</b> <b>program,</b> and were not affected by navigation measurements. Until the end of the S-IC burn, guidance commands were functions only of time.|$|E
25|$|In the US, John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford E. Berry of Iowa State University {{developed}} and tested the Atanasoff–Berry Computer (ABC) in 1942, the first electronic digital calculating device. This design was also all-electronic, and used about 300 vacuum tubes, with capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory. However, its paper card writer/reader was unreliable, {{and work on}} the machine was discontinued. The machine's special-purpose nature and lack of a changeable, <b>stored</b> <b>program</b> distinguish it from modern computers.|$|E
25|$|The Olivetti Programma 101 was {{introduced}} in late 1965; it was a <b>stored</b> <b>program</b> machine which could read and write magnetic cards and displayed results on its built-in printer. Memory, implemented by an acoustic delay line, could be partitioned between program steps, constants, and data registers. Programming allowed conditional testing and programs could also be overlaid by reading from magnetic cards. It {{is regarded as the}} first personal computer produced by a company (that is, a desktop electronic calculating machine programmable by non-specialists for personal use). The Olivetti Programma 101 won many industrial design awards.|$|E

25|$|The {{programming}} of the <b>stored</b> <b>program</b> for ENIAC {{was done}} by Betty Jennings, Clippinger and Adele Goldstine. It was first demonstrated as a stored-program computer on September 16, 1948, running a program by Adele Goldstine for John von Neumann. This modification reduced the speed of ENIAC {{by a factor of}} six and eliminated the ability of parallel computation, but as it also reduced the reprogramming time to hours instead of days, it was considered well worth the loss of performance. Also analysis had shown that due to differences between the electronic speed of computation and the electromechanical speed of input/output, almost any real-world problem was completely I/O bound, even without making use of the original machine's parallelism. Most computations would still be I/O bound, even after the speed reduction imposed by this modification.|$|E
25|$|Conway Berners-Lee, a {{mathematician}} and computer scientist from Birmingham, {{works in the}} team that develops the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercial <b>stored</b> <b>program</b> electronic computer. Berners-Lee is demobilized from the British Army in 1947 with the rank of Major. By the late 1960s Berners-Lee leads the Medical Development Team of ICT and then ICL and is involved {{in some of the}} earliest developments in the applications of computers in medicine, and his text compression ideas are taken up by an early electronic patient record system. Berners-Lee later marries Mary Lee Woods (also from Birmingham). Woods studies at Birmingham University and later works in the team that develop programs for the Manchester Mark 1, Ferranti Mark 1 and Mark 1 Star computers. In 1955 the Berners-Lees become parents to Tim Berners-Lee, who invents the World Wide Web, making the first proposal for it in March 1989.|$|E
25|$|ENIAC {{could be}} {{programmed}} to perform complex sequences of operations, including loops, branches, and subroutines. However, instead of the <b>stored</b> <b>program</b> computers that exist today, ENIAC was just a large collection of arithmetic machines, which had programs hard coded into the machines with function tables that each contained 1200 ten way switches. The task of taking a problem and mapping it onto the machine was complex, and usually took weeks. Due {{to the complexity of}} mapping programs onto the machine, programs were only changed after huge numbers of tests of the current program. After the program was figured out on paper, the process of getting the program into ENIAC by manipulating its switches and cables could take days. This was followed by a period of verification and debugging, aided by the ability to execute the program step by step. A programming tutorial for the modulo function using an ENIAC simulator gives an impression of what a program on the ENIAC looked like.|$|E

25|$|ENIAC was a one-of-a-kind {{design and}} was never repeated. The freeze on design in 1943 meant that the {{computer}} design would lack some innovations that soon became well-developed, notably the ability to store a program. Eckert and Mauchly started work on a new design, to be later called the EDVAC, which would be both simpler and more powerful. In particular, in 1944 Eckert wrote his description of a memory unit (the mercury delay line) which would hold both the data and the program. John von Neumann, who was consulting for the Moore School on the EDVAC, sat in on the Moore School meetings at which the <b>stored</b> <b>program</b> concept was elaborated. Von Neumann wrote up an incomplete set of notes (First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC) which were intended {{to be used as}} an internal memorandum—describing, elaborating, and couching in formal logical language the ideas developed in the meetings. ENIAC administrator and security officer Herman Goldstine distributed copies of this First Draft to a number of government and educational institutions, spurring widespread interest in {{the construction of a new}} generation of electronic computing machines, including Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) at Cambridge University, England and SEAC at the U.S. Bureau of Standards.|$|E
500|$|While {{consulting}} for the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania on the EDVAC project, von Neumann {{wrote an}} incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC. The paper, whose premature distribution nullified the patent claims of EDVAC designers J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, described a computer architecture {{in which the}} data and the program are both stored in the computer's memory in the same address space. This architecture {{is the basis of}} most modern computer designs, unlike the earliest computers that were [...] "programmed" [...] using a separate memory device such as a paper tape or plugboard. Although the single-memory, <b>stored</b> <b>program</b> architecture is commonly called von Neumann architecture as a result of von Neumann's paper, the architecture was {{based on the work of}} Eckert and Mauchly, inventors of the ENIAC computer at the University of Pennsylvania.|$|E

After the end of the war, Bartik went on to work with the ENIAC designers John Eckert and John Mauchly, and helped them develop the BINAC and UNIVAC I computers. BINAC was the first computer to use magnetic tape instead of punch cards to store data and the first computer to utilize the twin unit concept, and Bartik programmed a guidance system to run on it for Northrop Aircraft. She was responsible for designing the UNIVAC's logic circuits. Recalling her time working with Eckert and Mauchly on these projects, she described their close group of computer engineers as a [...] "technical Camelot." ...|$|E
