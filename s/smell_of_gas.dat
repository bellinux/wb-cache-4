2500|$|The {{development}} {{of a sense of}} smell is also thought to have arisen to function as an arousal system. [...] Once an odor enters into conscious memory, it can signal the presence of a threat, like the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> or smoke. [...] However, odor memory can also be an implicit or unconscious process. [...] This ability to respond automatically to a warning stimulus is much like pre-attentive processes in other sensory systems which involve the use of automatic forms of memory. [...] These response patterns have evolved over time and involve a wide variety of motor and autonomic responses which are integrated into the behaviour pattern of reacting to a warning stimulus. [...] odor-induced anxiety can be caused when an animal senses a predator. [...] A study conducted on rats showed that when a rat was exposed to cat odors, there was increased anxiety-related behaviour in the rat. [...] The cat odor induced an inhibition of the endocannabinoid system in the amygdala which has been suggested to induce anxiety-related responses.|$|E

60|$|Deafened by {{the applause}} {{of those who}} had heard little and {{understood}} less, half stifled by the heat of the room, and their heads aching from the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas,</b> the girls now hoped to escape; but they were forced to wait till the crowd nearer the door had dispersed, and then to listen to the numerous compliments and congratulations which poured in upon Mrs. Turner from all quarters before they could reach the open air; and then, strenuously refusing all invitations to take tea in St. Martin's Street, they happily regained the Vicarage. Helen and Lucy met them at the door, with hopes that they had had a pleasant evening.|$|E
60|$|The {{cemetery}} {{was made}} when I {{was a little}} boy of five or six; I was in the full tide of building and growth from the first; the second railway with its station at Bromstead North and the drainage followed when I was ten or eleven, and all my childish memories are of digging and wheeling, of woods invaded by building, roads gashed open and littered with iron pipes amidst a fearful <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas,</b> of men peeped at and seen toiling away deep down in excavations, of hedges broken down and replaced by planks, of wheelbarrows and builders' sheds, of rivulets overtaken and swallowed up by drain-pipes. Big trees, and especially elms, cleared of undergrowth and left standing amid such things, acquired a peculiar tattered dinginess rather in the quality of needy widow women who have seen happier days.|$|E
50|$|Cystolepiota bucknallii is {{a species}} of {{basidiomycete}} fungus of the genus Cystolepiota. Found throughout Europe, it is a rare fungus occurring in deciduous forests.

25|$|At room {{temperature}} and standard pressure, methane is a colorless, odorless <b>gas.</b> The familiar <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>gas</b> {{as used in}} homes is achieved {{by the addition of}} an odorant, usually blends containing tert-butylthiol, as a safety measure. Methane has a boiling point of −161 °C (−257.8 °F) at a pressure of one atmosphere. As a gas it is flammable over a range of concentrations (5.4–17%) in air at standard pressure.|$|R
50|$|At 22:50, the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> {{chlorine}} <b>gas</b> in {{main control}} prompted another {{assessment of the}} boat's condition. A vent valve was found {{that had not been}} tightly shut, and more water had seeped into the aft battery compartment. All lithium hydroxide canisters were brought forward, and the survivors sealed themselves in the forward torpedo room. By 23:30, two canisters of lithium hydroxide were opened and spread. The crew was put to bed.|$|R

I took my colleagues down at once, and we sat {{on the floor of the}} cellar and held a {{consultation}} till the overpowering <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> convinced me that there was nothing for it but an operation on the floor. The whole thing was most successful. I was very glad, as it happened that the proprietor of the house was a very decent fellow, employed, I think, as a manager of a bank, or something of the sort. He was most grateful. It was he who gave me the engraved monkey wrench that some of you were admiring before dinner. After we had finished the whole operation--I forgot to say that we had thrown the coal out on the lawn to avoid any complication--he quite broke down. He offered us to take his whole house and keep it." ...|$|E

"Well, sir, you see," [...] said he, [...] "there was an 'orrid <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> in the 'ouse, an' the missus {{she sent}} for a gas man {{to find out}} where it was, and, would you believe it, sir, they went to look for it with a candle! Sure enough they found it too, in a small cupboard. The gas had been escapin', it had, but couldn't git out o' that there cupboard, 'cause the door was a tight fit, so it had made its way all over the 'ouse between the lath and plaster and the walls. As soon as ever it caught light, sir, it blowed the whole place into smash--as you see. It blowed the gas man flat on his back; (an' sarved him right!) it blowed the missus through the doorway, an' it blowed the cook--(as was on the landin' outside)--right down the kitchen stairs, it did;--but there was none of 'em much hurt, sir, they wasn't, beyond a bruise or two!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{was pleased}} with the way the actress listened, the next day, at the reading; he was pleased indeed with many things, at the reading, and most of all with the reading itself. The whole affair loomed large to him and he {{magnified}} it and mapped it out. He enjoyed his occupation of the big, dim, hollow theatre, full of the echoes of [...] "effect" [...] and of a queer <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> and success--it all seemed such a passive canvas for his picture. For {{the first time in his}} life he was in command of resources; he was acquainted with the phrase, but had never thought he should know the feeling. He was surprised at what Loder appeared ready to do, though he reminded himself that he must never show it. He foresaw that there would be two distinct concomitants to the artistic effort of producing a play, one consisting of a great deal of anguish and the other of a great deal of amusement. He looked back upon the reading, afterwards, as the best hour in the business, because it was then that the piece had most struck him as represented. What came later was the doing of others; but this, with its imperfections and failures, was all his own. The drama lived, at any rate, for that hour, with an intensity that it was promptly to lose in the poverty and patchiness of rehearsal; he could see its life reflected, in a way that was sweet to him, in the stillness of the little semi-circle of attentive and inscrutable, of water-proofed and muddy-booted, actors. Miss Violet Grey was the auditor he had most to say to, and he tried on the spot, across the shabby stage, to let her have the soul of her part. Her attitude was graceful, but though she appeared to listen with all her faculties her face remained perfectly blank; a fact, however, not discouraging to Wayworth, who liked her better for not being premature. Her companions gave discernible signs of recognising the passages of comedy; yet Wayworth forgave her even then for being inexpressive. She evidently wished before everything else to be simply sure of what it was all about.|$|E
5000|$|The {{so-called}} sulfate-reducing bacteria, by contrast, [...] "breathe sulfate" [...] {{instead of}} oxygen. They use organic compounds or molecular hydrogen as the energy source. They use sulfur as the electron acceptor, and reduce various oxidized sulfur compounds back into sulfide, often into hydrogen sulfide. They can grow on other partially oxidized sulfur compounds (e.g. thiosulfates, thionates, polysulfides, sulfites). The hydrogen sulfide produced by these bacteria {{is responsible for}} some <b>of</b> the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> intestinal <b>gases</b> (flatus) and decomposition products.|$|R

50|$|After the explosions, {{there was}} great panic on April 25 among {{residents}} of the neighborhoods 5 De Mayo, el Dean, Echeverría and Polanco; firefighters asked people to avoid lighting any flames, due to a strong <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas.</b> It was later confirmed to be a leak in a Pemex pipe.|$|E
50|$|Utility {{companies}} have enclosed scratch and sniff cards in their bills {{to educate the}} public in recognizing the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> a methane <b>gas</b> leak. In 1987, cards distributed by the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company led to a rash of false alarms when the scents of cards in unopened envelopes were mistaken for real gas leaks.|$|R
5000|$|Built near to a gas holder, the {{constant}} <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> town <b>gas</b> {{in the air}} {{gave rise to the}} name used for Bristol Rovers fans of [...] "The Gas" [...] or [...] "Gasheads". The nickname [...] "The Gas" [...] began as a derogatory nickname used by Bristol City fans, however Rovers fans now refer to themselves as Gasheads as a badge of honour.

50|$|High-volume {{hydraulic}} fracturing in New York State(NYS) {{is no longer}} a problem but was earlier. Problems with this were contamination of drinking water. It polluted the air with tons <b>of</b> natural <b>gas</b> that was pumped from the ground. The drinking water at point was flammable when pedestrians and home owners would light their drinking water on fire. The <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> the <b>gases</b> impacted homeowners health very badly making some sick. But also it took up a lot of space and affected the living lifestyles of those that were near the sites where they pumped. Another impacted was habitat loss due to the large structures.|$|R

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} Friday prayers on 22 June, {{hundreds}} of Sudanese assembled to protest. Unlike the previous protest held {{during the past}} few days, this protest was not mainly a student-led one due to the protest spreading into many neighborhoods that had been quiet. Protests took place in Omdurman, Khartoum, Burri, Al-Daim, El Obeid, Sennar, and Bahri saw demonstrations after noon prayers. The police escalated the use of force during their clashes with the protesters and the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> tear <b>gas</b> and broken rocks covered streets. Men in civilian clothes also attacked the demonstrators. Students in Kassala protested on 27 June outside the local university against the austerity measures and called for regime change.|$|R
50|$|Geologists from Tonga and New Zealand {{who visited}} the volcano on January 19 said the {{eruption}} had quieted in the last 24 hours. They noted that nearly all the eruption was now coming from the vent on the new island, with steam clouds rising to a height of 7 to 10 km, and ash and rock being thrown to a height of about 200 to 300 m. Emission of ash was limited, with magma rocks hitting the ocean causing some steam explosions. The team found no floating volcanic debris, such as pumice rafts, and the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> volcanic <b>gases</b> was intermittent. Tongan officials established a zone 20 km in diameter around the island to protect visitors from rock, ash, and acid rain.|$|R
50|$|Some {{time before}} 10:20 local time (03:20 GMT), {{employees}} of the ground-floor eatery noticed the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> emanating from the kitchen.

It was {{furnished}} with a bagatelle board, two or three wooden tables, some wooden forms, and a wooden bookcase. Seated on these wooden chairs, or standing up, were youths, and older men of the working class, who seemed to Shelton to be peculiarly dejected. One was reading, one against the wall was drinking coffee with a disillusioned air, two were playing chess, and a group of four made a ceaseless clatter with the bagatelle.|$|R
40|$|As {{olfactory}} perceptions {{vary from}} person to person, {{it is difficult to}} describe smells objectively. In contrast, electronic noses also detect smells with their sensors, but in addition describe those using electronic signals. Here we showed a virtual connection method between a human nose perceptions and electronic nose responses with the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> standard <b>gases.</b> In this method, Amorphophallus titanum flowers, which emit a strong carrion smell, could objectively be described using an electronic nose, in a way resembling the skill of sommeliers. We could describe the flower smell to be close to that of a mixture of methyl mercaptan and propionic acid, by calculation of the dilution index from electronic resistances. In other words, the <b>smell</b> resembled that <b>of</b> “decayed cabbage, garlic and pungent sour” with possible descriptors. Additionally, we compared the <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> flowers which bloomed on different dates and at different locations and showed the similarity of odor intensities visually, in standard gas categories. We anticipate our assay to be a starting point for a perceptive connection between our noses and electronic noses...|$|R
