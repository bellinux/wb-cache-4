Based on the different cost structure and service level constraint to two firms, we compare the decision making in two possible decision systems, that is, centralized system and decentralized system. In a centralized system—the first best case as a benchmark is contrasted with decentralized system. In the decentralized system, a Stackelberg game model is formulated between two firms. Some discordant decisions would be made by firm I's overestimate motivation and firm II's undersupply motivation. Our primary objective is to design penalty schemes to coordinate the interactions for two firms. The study shows in a decentralized system, setting suitable penalty schemes can coordinate the two firms' decision. We also study the feasible range of penalty parameters, and some important managerial insights are then deduced.

By investigating the impact of the extent of operations on unit costs of carriers, it was inspected the existence of economies of scale in providing maintenance services. Through an econometric model of maintenance costs, it was estimated the influence of key drivers such as the aircraft average stage length, aircraft size and load factors. It was performed an application to the Brazilian airline industry. The empirical model makes use of a Fixed- Effects Estimator (FE), using a four-dimensional panel data of flight <b>segments,</b> <b>carriers</b> and equipment over a period of ten years. Results showed support for the hypothesis of scale economies in maintenance services. The academic gain of this article is through econometric analysis identify factors that influence the maintenance costs for airlines.

40|$|DNA-based aptamers {{have been}} {{proposed}} as a simultaneous active targeting agent and delivery vehicle for anticancer drugs. PHENSS is a platinum-based anticancer complex that reversibly binds to DNA. Previous research has shown reduced targeting ability of aptamers when platinum compounds are bound to them. This study aimed to attach PHENSS to a DNA-based-aptamer, AS 1411, using a high affinity <b>carrier</b> <b>segment</b> based on adenosine bulge secondary DNA structures. Drug-carrier segment binding was studied using DNA melting, circular dichroism spectrophotometry and 1 D and 2 D NOESY 1 H NMR. In vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed against on-target MCF- 7 and off-target HEK- 293 cell lines. DNA melting experiments appeared to demonstrate PHENSS intercalation into the <b>carrier</b> <b>segment,</b> although, there was no apparent increase in the melting temperature. Circular dichroism, however, confirmed PHENSS binding in a drug-carrier segment ratio of 2 : 1, consistent with the two adenosine bulge sites. The binding was also confirmed by 1 H NMR, where the large upfield shifts of the PHENSS proton resonances (0. 75 - 0. 95 and 0. 8 ppm) were consistent with an intercalative mode of binding. Broadening of both the PHENSS and <b>carrier</b> <b>segment</b> resonances indicate fast-to-intermediate exchange kinetics, on the NMR timescale. The in vitro cytotoxicity assay showed a statistically insignificant reduced activity of PHENSS when bound to the aptamer vehicle (IC 50 : 2. 37 ± 0. 91 µM) compared with PHENSS alone (IC 50 : 0. 72 ± 0. 23 µM) in the MCF- 7 cell line and a statistically insignificant increase in HEK- 293 cells (IC 50 : 2. 21 ± 1. 01 µM and 4. 29 ± 2. 71 µM, respectively, (p> 0. 05).

However, thiazolidinediones induce fluid retention, edema, and sometimes precipitate or exacerbate heart failure in a subset of patients. The mechanism through which thiazolidinediones induce fluid retention is controversial. Most studies suggest that this effect results from the increase in tubular sodium and water reabsorption in the kidney, but the role of specific nephron <b>segments</b> and sodium <b>carriers</b> involved is less clear. Some studies suggested that PPARγ agonist stimulates Na+ reabsorption in the collecting duct by activating epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), either directly or through serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase- 1 (SGK- 1). However, other studies did not confirm this mechanism and even report the suppression of ENaC. Alternative mechanisms in the collecting duct include stimulation of non-ENaC sodium channel or inhibition of chloride secretion to the tubular lumen. In addition, thiazolidinediones may augment sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule by stimulating the expression and activity of apical Na+/H+ exchanger- 3 and basolateral Na+- cotransporter {{as well as of}} Na+,K+-ATPase.

40|$|AbstractThe {{sequences}} of three mitochondrial carriers involved in energy transfer, the ADP/ATP carrier, phosphate carrier and uncoupling carrier, are analyzed. Similarly {{to what has}} been previously reported for the ADP/ATP carrier and the uncoupling protein, now also the phosphate carrier is found to have a tripartite structure comprising three similar repeats of approx. 100 residues each. The three sequences show a fair overall homology with each other. More significant homologies are found by comparing the repeats within and between the carriers in a scheme where the sequences are spliced into repeats, which are arranged for maximum homology by allowing possible insertions or deletions. A striking conservation of critical residues, glycine, proline, of charged and of aromatic residues is found throughout all nine repeats. This is indicative of a similar structural principle in the repeats. Hydropathy profiles of the three proteins and a search for amphipathic α-spans reveal six membrane-spanning <b>segments</b> for each <b>carrier,</b> providing further support for the basic structural identity of the repeats. The proposed folding pattern of the carriers in the membrane is exemplified with the phosphate carrier. A possible tertiary arrangement of the repeats and the membranespanning helices is shown.

While the periodic generation and transmission of such messages already place {{a heavy burden}} on the network load, the hidden nodes further complicate the network situation with packet collisions being undetectable. In this paper, we propose a space-division multiple access (SDMA) technique combined with an adaptive rate control mechanism to improve the efficiency of BSM transmissions.

The unlinkage drag values of the donated <b>segments</b> on the <b>carrier</b> chromosomes were between 5.91 and 40 % of the total donor component on the carrier chromosomes (Table  3).

On average, the donor genome content in BC 3 F 3 BILs was not significantly different from that of BC 1 F 2 (Table  2 and Table  3). The same was true for the homozygous components of linkage drag and donor unlinked, whereas the heterozygous components were significantly decreased during pseudo-backcrossing. These results could indicate that high frequency of recombination between donated segments and the recipient genome contents of the carrier chromosomes in the BC 1 cycle was primarily due to the high donor genome content in successive pseudo-backcrossings. Furthermore, the significant reduction in heterozygous donor components for the BC 3 F 3 BILs highlights an advantage of pseudo-backcrossing in gene pyramiding.|$|R

The masker AM was followed by a 50 -ms burst of AM of the same rate (signal AM) imposed on the same (uninterrupted) carrier, either immediately after the masker or with a delay. In the physiological experiment, single-unit extracellular recordings in the awake rabbit inferior colliculus (IC) were obtained for stimuli designed to be similar to the uninterrupted-carrier conditions used in the psychophysics. The masker AM was longer (500  ms compared with 150  ms in the psychophysical experiment), and the carrier and modulation rate were chosen based on each neuron’s audio- and envelope-frequency selectivity. Based on the average discharge rates of the responses or on the temporal correlation between neural responses to masked and unmasked stimuli, only a small subset of the population of IC cells exhibited suppression of signal AM following the masker. In contrast, changes in the discharge rates between the temporal <b>segments</b> of the <b>carrier</b> immediately preceding the signal AM and during the signal AM varied as a function of masker-signal delay with a trend that matched the psychophysical results.

The contrast between the degree of linkage drag for the two functional genes Xa 21 and xa 5 was unexpected, as the pair of loci was inherited from the same donor, Xa 497. As both xa 5 and Xa 21 were MAB using their functional markers, it is interesting to speculate on the differences in linkage drag between the two functional genes. The size of the linkage of Xa 21 is much greater than for the two functional genes Sub 1 and TPS, and the other QTLs, qBL 1, qBL 11 and qBph 3. Heterozygous linkage drags were identified for five of the eight target genes/QTLs, including the Xa 21 locus (Table  2), Donor-unlinks—the additional donor segments co-transmitted on the opposite (unlinked) chromosome arms of the target genes/QTLs—were identified on the carrier chromosomes containing Xa 21, qBL 1, qBL 11 and TPS (Table  2). Therefore, the total donor segments transmitted via BC 1 along with Xa 21 were obviously the largest among the target loci under MAB (Table  2).|$|R
30|$|Compared with InAs, ternary InxGa 1 [*]−[*]xAs with tunable {{chemical}} stoichiometries {{and band}} gap of 0.34  eV[*]≤[*]Eg[*]≤[*] 1.42  eV {{have been shown}} to be a good alternative device channel material. This substitution can greatly reduce the leakage current without seriously sacrificing the high electron mobility [19, 21 – 24]. In our previous works, the relationship between the components of InxGa 1 [*]−[*]xAs NWs and electrical properties of InxGa 1 [*]−[*]xAs NWs FETs has been systematically studied. Decreasing the In concentration reduces the off current by about two orders of magnitude and enhances the on/off current ratios by about two orders of magnitude with only a small decrease of mobility [21]. Apart from the composition of NWs, the number of crystal defects, such as twinning planes and stacking faults in III–V NWs, often results from unsuitable growth parameters during the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method [19, 25, 26 – 28]. These crystal defects also seriously affect the geometric and the electronic structure. For instance, the zinc blende <b>segments</b> can trap <b>carriers</b> and thereby reduce the electron transport speed in polytypic InP NWs [28]. Hence, it is important to synthesize InGaAs NWs with a controlled structure and defect density to improve their carrier mobility and lifetime in all technological applications. However, at present, due to their complex growth process, there remains considerable challenges to synthesizing InxGa 1 [*]−[*]xAs NWs (x[*]=[*] 0 to 1) with uniform structures and a low defect density along the whole NW. Therefore, designing a growth process to produce high-quality InxGa 1 [*]−[*]xAs NWs is still quite a challenge [1, 26]. In an attempt to achieve this goal, it is necessary to thoroughly explore the growth mechanism of InxGa 1 [*]−[*]xAs NWs using the CVD method.|$|R
40|$|Welding {{process has}} been leading {{technological}} process {{in the production of}} modern metal products and structures for a long time. Among others, a very important characteristic of welding technology is that in the appropriate zone of construction it creates large temperature differences during cooling of pieces, because of disturbed expansion and contraction, creating internal stresses, which in practical applications of welded structures represent a serious problem. Internal stresses incurred as a result of welding can have very high values, even to the value of yield stress, so that a regular occurrence that is still {{in the course of the}} welding parts deform. Consideration of stress kinetic shows that at elevated temperatures, in certain conditions, the intensity of residual stress may cross the border and cause breakdown of materials and fracture. Residual stresses are multidirectional, and in combination with other stresses (stresses from external forces or its own weight) or at low temperatures could create conditions for the development of brittle fracture. This danger is greater as the parts that connect are with larger thickness and of higher strength materials, as well as misdialled technology of welding. Residual stresses in welded construction are undesirable, and it is necessary to eliminate or at least reduce their negative impact on structural safety. The procedure that is commented on in this work is the implementation of vibratory stress relieving method on main <b>carrier</b> <b>segments</b> of double girder bridge crane with projected capacity Q = 150 kN and the range L = 24 m. The applied VSR method with the control of implemented process has enabled the release of residual stresses in welded construction of the crane. Key words: vibratory stress relief (VSR), double girder bridge crane, welding. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of technical trading rules applied to asset play in the international bulk shipping industry. The rules are tested on monthly returns in the Products <b>Carrier</b> <b>segment</b> for the period 1981 to 1998. The paper evaluates 1053 different parameterizations {{of three of the}} simplest and most popular trading rules in the financial markets: filter rules, moving averages, and support and resistance levels. Overall, the results provide strong support for the technical strategies. None of the trading rules generate negative cumulative wealth, and only one parameterization results in a mean return that is lower than the return from the benchmark buy-and-hold strategy. The results for the best-performing trading rule show that the mean return following buy signals is positive and the mean return following sell signals is negative, both significantly different from the buy-and-hold mean return according to standard statistical tests. Moreover, the returns following buy signals are less volatile than those following sell signals, as well as the returns of the buy-and-hold strategy. The best-performing trading rule obtains a mean return of 35. 4 % p. a. above the buy-and-hold annual return of 4. 0 %. Due to a low number of trades, the introduction of trading costs has little impact on the results. Adjusting for data-snooping biases according to White's Reality Check bootstrap methodology confirms the conclusion that the best-performing trading rule provides superior investing performance. However, the practical implementation in an illiquid market may reduce the theoretical excess return of the best-performing trading rule to a level where it is no longer significant. Moreover, the probability that an investor could have picked ex ante a trading rule with statistically significant excess return is small...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{the complex}} nature of the air {{transportation}} industry with continuous changes in the environment, the past records of air traffic forecasters, either using trend extrapolation or causal models or even more sophisticated methods have not produced accurate results. In recent years, the trend has been to develop air travel demand forecasts based on econometric equations, which specify a relationship between passenger traffic {{and a number of}} traditional key economic variables. However these forecasts do not take into account air traffic downturns or strong increases. Periods of economic or political uncertainty are associated with consumer confidence volatility, suggesting that swings in confidence could influence air travel demand. The failure of forecasters to predict the repeated peaks and troughs since 2001 has renewed interest in supplementing econometric forecasts with qualitative indicators such as consumer confidence indices. These variables are available for some countries and the aim of this research is to find whether forecasts based on these indices are more accurate in predicting short-term traffic up and downs. Through the analysis of three case studies, this thesis examines how the introduction of a confidence index in the air travel demand model, including only macroeconomic variables, could have some ability to improve the forecast accuracy of the model. For each case study, the demand for the market has been divided according to the existing supply side <b>segments,</b> namely legacy <b>carriers,</b> low cost carriers and non-scheduled airlines. The results show that this confidence index has some ability to improve the forecast accuracy of both, the global top-down and the bottom-up models built for some supply side segments, notably the legacy ones during periods of uncertainty such as 1991, 2001, 2008 and 2009. The results are also suggesting that the forecasting power of this index is increasing when applied to more mature markets such as the demand linked to the US legacy carriers or to the European charter airlines. This study is appraising the performance of consumer confidence indexes by examining their impact on different air travel demand forecasts...|$|R
