50|$|With {{the coming}} of printing, pieces of type were cast {{to enable them to}} appear in print. These are still {{commonly}} used in French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish, though their appearance in English has diminished. Not every letter in the alphabet has a piece of type cast for it as a <b>superior</b> <b>letter.</b> In the book Thinking in Type, by Alex W. White, it is stated that there are only twelve superior letters used in French and Spanish: a, b, d, e, i, l, m, n, o, r, s, and t. In English, however, 'h' is also sometimes rendered as a <b>superior</b> <b>letter,</b> as in 6th.|$|E
50|$|In {{typography}} and handwriting, a <b>superior</b> <b>letter</b> is a {{lower-case letter}} placed above the baseline and made smaller than ordinary script. The style {{has traditionally been}} distinct from superscript. Formerly quite common in abbreviations, the original purpose was to make handwritten abbreviations clearly distinct from normal words. These {{could also be used}} to enable the important words on signs to be larger. In technical terms, the <b>superior</b> <b>letter</b> can also be called the superscripted minuscule letter. In modern usage, with word processors and text entry interfaces, superscript and superior letters are produced in the same way and look identical, and their distinction would refer to their usage and not to their form.|$|E
5000|$|One {{abbreviation}} using a <b>superior</b> <b>letter,</b> the numero sign, {{has been}} given its own character: №. Originally, this was just another use of a superior o, abbreviating numero, the word for [...] "number" [...] in several Romance languages. It often appears in English, for example in № 2 pencil, for [...] "number-two pencil".|$|E
50|$|In English, <b>superior</b> <b>letters</b> are {{reserved}} for use with ordinal numerals, though this use is not mandatory and not always preferred: 1ˢᵗ, 2ⁿᵈ, 3ʳᵈ, etc.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Superior</b> <b>letters</b> {{are used}} to shorten various words {{in order to save}} space: f.o (folio, [...] "page"); titles: D.a (doña, [...] "Lady", [...] "Ms."); {{personal}} compound given names: M.a Cristina (María Cristina) and regular administrative expressions: imp.to (impuesto, [...] "tax").|$|R
5000|$|Some {{languages}} use <b>superior</b> <b>letters</b> as a typographic convention for abbreviations. Oftentimes, the ordinal indicators [...] "º" [...] and [...] "ª" [...] {{are used}} in this sense, and not to indicate ordinal numbers. Some might {{say that this is}} a misuse of ordinal indicators: ...|$|R
50|$|A single {{typeface}} {{may contain}} sub- and superscript glyphs at different positions for different uses. The four most common positions are listed here. Because each position {{is used in}} different contexts, not all alphanumerics may be available in all positions. For example, subscript letters on the baseline are quite rare, and many typefaces provide {{only a limited number}} of superscripted letters. Despite these differences, all reduced-size glyphs go by the same generic terms subscript and superscript, which are synonymous with the terms inferior letter (or number) and <b>superior</b> <b>letter</b> (or number), respectively. Most fonts that contain superscript/subscript will have predetermined size and orientation that is dependent on the design of the font.|$|E
50|$|In French, certain {{abbreviations}} {{are written}} {{with the first}} letter(s) of the word they represent, followed by the final letter(s) in superscript. The superscript {{in this case is}} sometimes optional. Most commonly, this appears in the abbreviations of personal titles: Mgr (or Mgr) stands for monseigneur ("Your Grace"), Mlle (or Mlle) for mademoiselle ("Miss"), Me for maître ("Mr"), etc. Other abbreviations containing <b>superior</b> <b>letters</b> are mdise for merchandise ("merchandise"), échce for échéance ("due date"), and Mo for métro ("subway").|$|R
50|$|Pendant numbers 13 {{were not}} {{allocated}} to flag <b>superiors.</b> The <b>letters</b> J and K were used with three number combinations {{due to the}} number of vessels.|$|R
50|$|Several <b>superior</b> <b>letters</b> {{are used}} in phonetic {{transcription}} systems. The International Phonetic Alphabet uses the superscript n ⁿ for nasal release, the superscript w ʷ to indicate labialized or labio-velarized consonants, the superscript h for aspirated consonants, the superscript j ʲ for palatalized consonants, the superscript gamma for velarized consonants, the superscript turned h ᶣ for labio-palatalized consonants, the superscript reversed glottal stop for pharyngealized consonants, the superscript glottal stop is used for glottalized but pulmonic sonorants, such as mˀ, lˀ, wˀ, aˀ.Other superscript letters are used as an alternative way to represent double articulated consonants, for example tˢ for t͡s.|$|R

25|$|Additional or {{supplemental}} glyphs {{intended to}} match a main typeface {{have been in}} use for centuries. In some formats they have been marketed as separate fonts. In the early 1990s, the Adobe Systems type group introduced the idea of expert set fonts, which had a standardized set of additional glyphs, including small caps, old style figures, and additional <b>superior</b> <b>letters,</b> fractions and ligatures {{not found in the}} main fonts for the typeface. Supplemental fonts have also included alternate letters such as swashes, dingbats, and alternate character sets, complementing the regular fonts under the same family. However, with introduction of font formats such as OpenType, those supplemental glyphs were merged into the main fonts, relying on specific software capabilities to access the alternate glyphs.|$|R

50|$|The {{individual}} ostraca {{probably come}} from the same broken clay pot and were most likely written {{in a short period of}} time.

5|$|In {{seeking to}} {{discipline}} the nuns, the Vatican did not contact {{any one of}} them personally, and did not respond to direct individual communication. Rather, the superiors of the nuns were asked to write letters verifying whether or not the nuns were in line with Catholic teaching on abortion, and a variety of responses were received from the superiors. A few nuns disavowed their position on abortion and the cases were quickly closed. Most nuns held to their earlier conviction, although their <b>superiors</b> sent <b>letters</b> saying that they accepted Church teaching.

40|$|Abstract: In this study, 114 preschoolers (M age= 53 months) {{completed}} {{a battery of}} literacy assessments to explore the interplay between name writing and letter knowledge in early literacy learners. Name writing {{was significantly related to}} children 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 s letter knowledge, and the relationships were moderate to high. However, many children exhibited an incongruity in name writing and name-specific letter-recognition skills (i. e., they could write their names but not recognize theletters in their names, or recognize the letters in their names but not write them). When these two groups were contrasted statistically, the children with <b>superior</b> name-specific <b>letter</b> recognition (but poorer name writing scores) had significantly higher letter knowledge scores than the children with superior name writing scores (but poor name-specific letter-recognition scores). Writing one 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 s name, in itself, did not appear to correspond to a literacy advantage. Thus, with regard to the recommendation that name writing be used as a literacy assessment tool in preschool, the results from this study suggest that name writing should be used as a measure of mechanical skill only and should not be used as a means to assess children 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 s conceptual knowledge (of letter names, letter sounds, or the alphabetic principle) ...|$|R
6000|$|So {{he wrote}} earnestly and peremptorily to his pupil, urging her, {{with all his}} subtle and refined eloquence, to make a final appeal to her mother, and if that failed, to act 'as her {{conscience}} should direct her;' and enclosed an answer from the superior of the convent, to a letter which Argemone had in a mad moment asked him to write. The <b>superior's</b> <b>letter</b> spoke of Argemone's joining her as a settled matter, and of her room as ready for her, while it lauded to the skies the peaceful activity and usefulness of the establishment. [...] This letter troubled Argemone exceedingly. She {{had never before been}} compelled to face her own feelings, either about the nunnery or about Lancelot. She had taken up the fancy of becoming a Sister of Charity, not as Honoria might have done, from genuine love of the poor, but from 'a sense of duty.' Almsgiving and visiting the sick were one of the methods of earning heaven prescribed by her new creed. She was ashamed of her own laziness by the side of Honoria's simple benevolence; and, sad though it may be to have to say it, she longed to outdo her by some signal act of self-sacrifice. She had looked to this nunnery, too, as an escape, once and for all, from her own luxury, just as people who have not strength to be temperate take refuge in teetotalism; and the thought of menial services towards the poor, however distasteful to her, came in quite prettily to fill up the little ideal of a life of romantic asceticisms and mystic contemplation, which gave the true charm in her eyes to her wild project. But now--just as a field had opened to her cravings after poetry and art, wider and richer than she had ever imagined-- just as those simple childlike views of man and nature, which she had learnt to despise, were assuming an awful holiness in her eyes-- just as she had found a human soul to whose regeneration she could devote all her energies,--to be required to give all up, perhaps for ever (and she felt that if at all, it ought to be for ever);--it was too much for her little heart to bear; and she cried bitterly; and tried to pray, and could not; and longed for a strong and tender bosom on which to lay her head, and pour out all her doubts and struggles; and there was none. Her mother did not understand-- hardly loved her. Honoria loved her; but understood her even less than her mother. Pride--the pride of intellect, the pride of self- will--had long since sealed her lips to her own family. [...] .|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Surgery is a labor-intensive, {{time-consuming}} profession. Young {{faculty members}} in surgery are saddled with many clinical time constraints that often allow precious few moments for academic pursuits. Consequently, K award submissions from surgeons trail nonsurgeons. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), however, is actively trying to encourage participation of surgeons in basic science research, translational research, clinical outcomes research, and even in prevention/control research. But, at the same time, the NIH has newly implemented a policy {{that has made the}} grant review process more restrictive by only allowing 2 submissions of any grant application. It is imperative, therefore, for junior faculty surgeons to learn “grantsmanship ” and have the ability to construct succinct, competitive K award grants. Although most of this information is public knowledge and made available by the NIH itself, many of the practical points presented here are tailored to the special needs of clinically active surgical researchers. Often, these “hints ” are buried on expansive websites that require considerable time to read and navigate. The authors have a long combined experience on a study section dedicated to adjudicating K awards. The goal of this review is to present concise, useful information about common errors, research plan dos and don’ts, template examples of <b>superior</b> mentored <b>letters,</b> and many other suggestions that may assist any first-time candidate for these awards...|$|R
50|$|The Headquarters of Commander Marianas on Guam {{and of the}} Commander Philippine Sea Frontier on Leyte kept Operations {{plotting}} boards {{on which}} were plotted the positions of all vessels with which the headquarters were concerned. However, for ships as large as Indianapolis, {{it was assumed that}} they would reach their destinations on time, unless reported otherwise. Therefore, their positions were based on predictions, and not on reports. On 31 July, when she should have arrived at Leyte, Indianapolis was removed from the board in the headquarters of Commander Marianas. She was also recorded as having arrived at Leyte by the headquarters of Commander Philippine Sea Frontier. Lieutenant Stuart B. Gibson, the Operations Officer under the Port Director, Tacloban, was the officer responsible for tracking the movements of Indianapolis. The vessel's failure to arrive on schedule was known at once to Lieutenant Gibson, who failed to investigate the matter and made no immediate report of the fact to his superiors. Gibson received a letter of reprimand in connection with the incident. The acting commander and operations officer of the Philippine Sea Frontier also received reprimands, while Gibson's immediate <b>superior</b> received a <b>letter</b> of admonition.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the BSS {{was playing}} {{an active role}} in suppressing the CCP. Zeng Kuoqing, using his status in the Whampoa Alumni Association, wrote a letter to Xu Jishen (許繼慎), {{commander}} of Zhang Guotao's 4th Red Army and a whampoa graduate, asking Xu to defect to the KMT. Xu did not reply, but when his <b>superiors</b> discovered the <b>letter,</b> suspicions were raised and the CCP decided to carry out a purge. Thousands of commanders and soldiers were tortured and executed, weakening the CCP's resistance. In light of this, in October 1932, Hu Zongnan led his army (mainly commanded by BSS officers) in a cruel and decisive battle against Xu Xiangqian in Hekou Anhui. In contrast to other KMT armies, the army had high-morale, was composed of hand-picked men, and equipped with the best weaponry. With strong support from other armies also led by BSS members such as Yu Jishi (俞濟時) and Huang Jie (黃杰), Xu's CCP army was routed. After suffering some 10,000 casualties, Zhang and Xu retreated. Hu and his troop chased, and when Zhang and his army reached Sichuan to set up another base, Hu remained in Gansu nearby. Hu, with his chosen men and strong army, became known as the King of Northwestern China.|$|R
40|$|The French {{intellectual}} {{has always}} held a prominent position in determining France's future.
