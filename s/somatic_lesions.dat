An important diagnostic {{goal is to}} distinguish patients with a focal hyperplasia of islet cells of the pancreas (FoPHHI) from those with a diffuse abnormality of islets (DiPHHI) because management strategies differ significantly. 16 infants with sporadic PHHI resistant to diazoxide and who underwent pancreatectomy were investigated. Selective pancreatic venous sampling coupled with peroperative surgical examination and analysis of extemporaneous frozen sections allowed us to identify 10 cases with FoPHHI and 6 cases with DiPHHI. We show here that in cases of FoPHHI, but not those of DiPHHI, there was specific loss of maternal alleles of the imprinted chromosome region 11 p 15 in cells of the hyperplastic area of the pancreas but not in normal pancreatic cells. This somatic event {{is consistent with a}} proliferative monoclonal lesion. It involves disruption of the balance between monoallelic expression of several maternally and paternally expressed genes. Thus, we provide the first molecular explanation of the heterogeneity of sporadic forms of PHHI such {{that it is possible to}} perform only partial pancreatectomy, limited to the focal <b>somatic</b> <b>lesion,</b> so as to avoid iatrogenic diabetes in patients with focal adenomatous hyperplasia...|$|R
40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} shown that {{targeted}} mutagenesis using zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) can be used to generate knockout zebrafish lines for analysis of their function and/or developing disease models. A number of different methods have been developed for the design and assembly of gene-specific ZFNs and TALENs, making them easily available to most zebrafish researchers. Regardless of the choice of targeting nuclease, the process of generating mutant fish is similar. It is a time-consuming and multi-step process that can benefit significantly from development of efficient high throughput methods. In this study, we used ZFNs assembled through either the CompoZr (Sigma-Aldrich) or the CoDA (context-dependent assembly) platforms to generate mutant zebrafish for nine genes. We report our improved high throughput methods for 1) evaluation of ZFNs activity by <b>somatic</b> <b>lesion</b> analysis using colony PCR, eliminating the need for plasmid DNA extractions from a large number of clones, and 2) a sensitive founder screening strategy using fluorescent PCR with PIG-tailed primers that eliminates the stutter bands and accurately identifies even single nucleotide insertions and deletions. Using these protocols, we have generated multiple mutant alleles for seven genes, five of which were targeted with CompoZr ZFNs and two with CoDA ZFNs. Our data also revealed that at least five-fold higher mRNA dose was required to achieve mutagenesis with CoDA ZFNs than with CompoZr ZFNs, and their somati...|$|R

Anchoring this analysis on a matched tumor/normal cell model from a lung adenocarcinoma patient identified three distinct target/response-indicator pairings that are represented with significant frequencies (6 %- 16 %) in the patient population.

40|$|Cancers evolve as a {{consequence}} of multiple <b>somatic</b> <b>lesions,</b> with competition between subclones and sequential subclonal evolution. Some driver mutations arise either early or late in the evolution of different individual tumors, suggesting that the final malignant properties of a subclone reflect the sum of mutations acquired rather than the order in which they arose. However, very {{little is known about the}} cellular consequences of altering the order in which mutations are acquired. Recent studies of human myeloproliferative neoplasms show that the order in which individual mutations are acquired has a dramatic impact on the cell biological and molecular properties of tumor-initiating cells. Differences in clinical presentation, complications, and response to targeted therapy were all observed and implicate mutation order as an important player in cancer biology. These observations represent the first demonstration that the order of mutation acquisition influences stem and progenitor cell behavior and clonal evolution in any cancer. Thus far, the impact of different mutation orders has only been studied in hematological malignancies, and analogous studies of solid cancers are now required. This is the author accepted manuscript.

40|$|AbstractTuberous {{sclerosis}} is {{a largely}} benign tumor syndrome {{derived from the}} acquisition of <b>somatic</b> <b>lesions</b> in genes encoding the tumor suppressor products, TSC 1 or TSC 2. Loss of function of the TSC 1 -TSC 2 complex, which acts as a Rheb GAP, yields constitutive, unrestrained signaling from the cell growth machinery comprised of Rheb, mTOR, and S 6 K. We demonstrate herein that constitutive activation of the Rheb/mTOR/S 6 K cassette, whether by genetic deletion of TSC 1 or TSC 2 or by ectopic expression of Rheb, is sufficient to induce insulin resistance. This {{is the result of}} downregulation of the insulin receptor substrates, IRS 1 and IRS 2, which become limiting for signal transmission from the insulin receptor to PI 3 K. Downstream of PI 3 K, the survival kinase, Akt, is completely refractory to activation by IRS-dependent growth factor pathways such as insulin or IGF-I in TSC 1 - or TSC 2 -deficient cells but not to activation by IRS-independent pathways such as those utilized by PDGF. The antiapoptotic program induced by IGF-I but not PDGF is severely compromised in TSC 2 null cells. Our results suggest that inappropriate activation of the Rheb/mTOR/S 6 K pathway imposes a negative feedback program to attenuate IRS-dependent processes such as cell survival...|$|E

AMACR was first found overexpressed in prostate cancer but not in benign glands and is now an established diagnostic marker for prostate cancer. Aberrant expression of AMACR was recently reported in Cca; however, {{little is known about}} how this gene is abnormally activated in cancer. By using a panel of immunostained-laser-capture-microdissected clinical samples comprising the entire colon adenoma-carcinoma sequence, we show that deregulation of AMACR during colon carcinogenesis involves two nonrandom events, resulting in the mutually exclusive existence of double-deletion at CG 3 and CG 10 and deletion of CG 12 - 16 in a newly identified CpG island within the core promoter of AMACR. The double-deletion at CG 3 and CG 10 was found to be a <b>somatic</b> <b>lesion.</b> It existed in histologically normal colonic glands and tubular adenomas with low AMACR expression and was absent in villous adenomas and all CCas expressing variable levels of AMACR. In contrast, deletion of CG 12 - 16 was shown to be a constitutional allele with a frequency of 43 % in a general population. Its prevalence reached 89 % in moderately differentiated CCas strongly expressing AMACR but only existed at 14 % in poorly differentiated CCas expressing little or no AMACR. The DNA sequences housing these deletions were found to be putative cis-regulatory elements for Sp 1 at CG 3 and CG 10, and ZNF 202 at CG 12 - 16. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, siRNA knockdown, gel shift assay, ectopic expression, and promoter analyses supported the regulation by Sp 1 and ZNF 202 of AMACR gene expression in an opposite manner. Our findings identified key in vivo events and novel transcription factors responsible for AMACR regulation in CCas and suggested these AMACR deletions may have diagnostic/prognostic value for colon carcinogenesis...|$|R

To define the landscape of somatic mutations in pediatric osteosarcoma, we performed whole-genome sequencing of DNA from 20 osteosarcoma tumor samples and matched normal tissue in a discovery cohort, as well as 14 samples in a validation cohort. Single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) exhibited a pattern of localized hypermutation called kataegis in 50 % of the tumors. We identified p 53 pathway lesions in all tumors in the discovery cohort, nine of which were translocations in the first intron of the TP 53 gene. Beyond TP 53, the RB 1, ATRX, and DLG 2 genes showed recurrent somatic alterations in 29 %– 53 % of the tumors.

40|$|Cancer {{is driven}} by the {{acquisition}} of <b>somatic</b> DNA <b>lesions.</b> Distinguishing the early driver mutations from subsequent passenger mutations is key to molecular sub- typing of cancers, understanding cancer progression, and the discovery of novel biomarkers. The advances of genomics technologies (whole-genome exome, and transcript sequencing, collectively referred to as NGS(Next Gengeration Sequencing)) have fueled recent studies on somatic mutation discovery. However, the vision is challenged by the complexity, redundancy, and errors in genomic data, and the difficulty of investigating the proteome translated portion of aberrant genes using only genomic approaches. Combination of proteomic and genomic technologies are increasingly being employed. This thesis provides a discussion of applying different strategies relating to large database search, and FDR(False Discovery Rate) based error control, and their implication to cancer proteogenomics. Moreover, it extends and develops the idea of a unified genomic variant database that can be searched by any mass spectrometry sample. Furthermore, we introduce a novel database creation method targeted for immunoglobulin peptide search. Finally, by applying our integrative proteogenomics pipeline, we have identified various types of mutated peptides and immunoglobulin gene rearrangements.

40|$|Objective: It is well {{established}} that subjective pain perception can be modulated by negative mood states and that patients with chronic pain are characterized by high levels of depression and anxiety. Nevertheless, very {{little is known about}} the effects of negative mood induction on brain processing of somatosensory information in fibromyalgia. The objective of the present study was to examine the influence of two emotional states (pleasant and unpleasant) on brain activity of patients with fibromyalgia (FM; n 27) and with musculoskeletal (MSK) pain resulting from identifiable <b>somatic</b> <b>lesions</b> (n 16). Methods: For this purpose, somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) elicited by nonpainful pneumatic stimuli, delivered to the right and left hand following an oddball paradigm, were recorded when patients were viewing affective slides. Results: As compared with patients with MSK pain, patients with FM displayed overall larger P 50 amplitude to tactile stimuli. In addition, significantly larger P 50 and smaller N 80 amplitudes were found within patients with FM when they were viewing the unpleasant rather than the pleasant slides. Conclusion: Our data suggest an abnormal processing of nonpainful somatosensory information in FM, especially when somatic signals are arising from the body within an aversive stimulus context. These findings provide further support for the use of biopsychosocial models for understanding FM and other chronic pain states.

In a previous study we reported the occurrence of activating somatic mutations of Gαs, which transduces mitogenic signals, in 30 % of the analyzed JGCTs. MethodsWe have searched for alterations in other proteins involved in ovarian mitogenic signaling. We focused on the PI 3 K–AKT axis. As we found mutations in AKT 1, we analyzed the subcellular localization of the mutated proteins and performed functional explorations using Western-blot and luciferase assays. FindingsWe detected in-frame duplications affecting the pleckstrin-homology domain of AKT 1 in more than 60 % of the tumors occurring in girls under 15 years of age. The somatic status of the mutations was confirmed when peritumoral DNA was available. The JGCTs without duplications carried point mutations affecting highly conserved residues. Several of these substitutions were <b>somatic</b> <b>lesions.</b> The mutated proteins carrying the duplications had a non-wild-type subcellular distribution, with a marked enrichment at the plasma membrane. This led to a striking degree of AKT 1 activation demonstrated by a strong phosphorylation level and by reporter assays.

NMZL still lacks distinct markers and remains orphan of specific cancer gene lesions. By combining whole exome sequencing, targeted sequencing of tumor-related genes, whole transcriptome sequencing, and high resolution SNP array analysis, we aimed at disclosing the pathways that are molecularly deregulated in NMZL and compare the molecular profile of NMZL with that of SMZL. These analyses identified a distinctive pattern of non-silent <b>somatic</b> <b>lesions</b> in NMZL. In 35 NMZL patients, 41 genes were found recurrently affected in ≥ 3 (9 %) of cases, including highly prevalent molecular lesions of MLL 2 (also known as KMT 2 D; 34 %), PTPRD (20 %), NOTCH 2 (20 %), and KLF 2 (17 %). Mutations of PTPRD, a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase regulating cell growth, were enriched in NMZL across mature B-cell tumors, functionally caused {{the loss of the}} phosphatase activity of PTPRD, and associated with cell cycle transcriptional program deregulation and increased proliferation index in NMZL. Though NMZL shared with SMZL a common mutation profile, NMZL harbored PTPRD lesions that were otherwise absent in SMZL. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the genetics of NMZL, identify PTPRD lesions as a novel marker for this lymphoma across mature B-cell tumors, and support the distinction of NMZL as an independent clinico-pathologic entity within the current lymphoma classification...|$|E

Most surveillance programs are based on histological assessment of dysplasia, but dysplasia is subject to observer variation and transient diagnoses of dysplasia increase the cost of medical care. We have previously validated flow cytometric increased 4 N fractions and aneuploidy as pre-dictors of progression to cancer in Barrett’s esophagus. However, multiple <b>somatic</b> genetic <b>lesions</b> develop during neoplastic progression in Barrett’s esophagus, {{and it is likely}} that a panel of objective biomarkers will be required to manage the cancer risk optimally.

40|$|Conventional {{high-grade}} osteosarcoma is {{the most}} common primary bone malignancy. Although altered expression of the p 53 inhibitor HDMX (Mdmx/Mdm 4) is associated with cancer risk, progression, and outcome in other tumor types, little is known about its role in osteosarcoma. High expression of the Hdmx splice variant HDMX-S relative to the full-length transcript (the HDMX-S/HDMX-FL ratio) correlates with reduced HDMX protein expression, faster progression, and poorer survival in several cancers. Here, we show that the HDMX-S/HDMX-FL ratio positively correlates with less HDMX protein expression, faster metastatic progression, and a trend to worse overall survival in osteosarcomas. We found that the HDMX-S/HDMX-FL ratio associated with common <b>somatic</b> genetic <b>lesions</b> connected with p 53 inhibition, such as p 53 mutation and HDM 2 overexpression in osteosarcoma cell lines. Interestingly, this finding was not limited to osteosarcomas as we observed similar associations in breast cancer {{and a variety of other}} cancer cell lines, as well as in tumors from patients with soft tissue sarcoma. The HDMX-S/HDMX-FL ratio better defined patients with sarcoma with worse survival rates than p 53 mutational status. We propose a novel role for alternative splicing of HDMX, whereby it serves as a mechanism by which HDMX protein levels are reduced in cancer cells that have already inhibited p 53 activity. Alternative splicing of HDMX could, therefore, serve as a more effective biomarker for p 53 pathway attenuation in cancers than p 53 gene mutation...|$|R

40|$|Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is {{a common}} {{childhood}} solid tumor, resulting from dysregulation of the skeletal myogenesis program. Two major histological subtypes occur in childhood RMS, embryonal and alveolar. While chromosomal rearrangements account {{for the majority of}} alveolar tumors, the genetic defects underlying the pathogenesis of embryonal RMS remain largely undetermined. A few studies performed on small series of embryonal tumors suggest that dysregulation of RAS function may be relevant to disease pathogenesis. To explore further the biological and clinical relevance of mutations with perturbing consequences on RAS signaling in embryonal RMS, we investigated the prevalence of PTPN 11, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF MEK 1, and MEK 2 mutations in a relatively large cohort of primary tumors. While HRAS and KRAS were found to be rarely mutated, we identified <b>somatic</b> NRAS <b>lesions</b> in 20 % of cases. All mutations were missense and affected codon 61, with the introduction of a positive charged amino acid residue representing the most common event. PTPN 11 was found mutated in one tumor specimen, confirming that somatic defects in this gene are relatively uncommon in RMS, while no mutation was observed in BRAF and MEK genes. Although no clear association of mutations with any clinical variable was observed, comparison of the outcome between mutation-positive and mutation-negative cases indicated a trend for a higher percentage of patients exhibiting a better outcome in the former.

40|$|When 5 -fluorouracil (FU) {{is offered}} {{simultaneously}} with 5 -bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) to Drosophila larvae, {{a variety of}} bristle modifications and hyperplastic growths are found {{on the wings of}} the adult flies. Administration of FU alone will not stimulate growth in Drosophila, while high concentrations of BUdR offered alone will induce a lower frequency of growth modifications than induced by BUdR plus FU. Comparison of the morphological response induced by sequential treatment with the two analogues and that by simultaneous treatment with the analogues at the same concentrations indicates that maximum response is achieved by the presence of both analogues at the same time. These observations suggest that BUdR may be the primary agent in upsetting morphogenesis in Drosophila, while FU plays a subsidiary role leading to intensification of the morphogenic effects when it is present during the treatment period. The incorporation of BUdR-H 3 and FU-H 3 in Drosophila tissues was demonstrated by autoradiography. BUdR-H 3 was incorporated in nuclei of both larval and imaginal disc cells, and the isotopic label was removable by deoxyribonuclease. Following dietary administration of FU-H 3, tritium was found in RNA, primarily in cytoplasmic regions. Since BUdR is a known mutagen, consideration was given to the hypothesis that the altered growth patterns in Drosophila wings are the result of somatic cell mutational events induced by BUdR. Validity of the argument that recessive mutations on the X chromosomes can be readily expressed in the somatic cells of the male with one X chromosome as opposed to the female with two X chromosomes was tested by comparing the frequency of the induced <b>somatic</b> cell <b>lesions</b> in male and female zygotes.

The purpose of this case report was to determine the possible genetic grounds for pulmonary BML. Case presentation We present a case report in an asymptomatic 44 -year-old female patient, who has developed uterine leiomyoma with subsequent pulmonary BML.

To find additional somatic abnormalities in aCML, we performed whole-exome sequencing on 15 aCML cases. In 2 cases (13. 3 %), we identified somatic missense mutations in the ETNK 1 gene. Targeted resequencing on 515 hematological clonal disorders revealed the presence of ETNK 1 variants in 6 (8. 8 %) of 68 aCML and 2 (2. 6 %) of 77 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia samples. These mutations clustered in a small region of the kinase domain, encoding for H 243 Y and N 244 S (1 / 8 H 243 Y; 7 / 8 N 244 S). They were all heterozygous and present in the dominant clone. The intracellular phosphoethanolamine/phosphocholine ratio was, on average, 5. 2 -fold lower in ETNK 1 -mutated samples (P <. 05). Similar results were obtained using myeloid TF 1 cells transduced with ETNK 1 wild type, ETNK 1 -N 244 S, and ETNK 1 -H 243 Y, where the intracellular phosphoethanolamine/phosphocholine ratio was significantly lower in ETNK 1 -N 244 S (0. 76 ± 0. 07) and ETNK 1 -H 243 Y (0. 37 ± 0. 02) than in ETNK 1 -WT (1. 37 ± 0. 32; P =. 01 and P =. 0008, respectively), suggesting that ETNK 1 mutations may inhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme.

40|$|The {{telomerase}} {{reverse transcriptase}} (TERT) promoter, {{an important element}} of telomerase expression, has emerged as a target of cancer-specific mutations. Originally described in melanoma, the mutations in TERT promoter {{have been shown to be}} common in certain other tumor types that include glioblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and bladder cancer. To fully define the occurrence and effect of the TERT promoter mutations, we investigated tumors from a well-characterized series of 327 patients with urothelial cell carcinoma of bladder. The somatic mutations, mainly at positions - 124 and - 146 bp from ATG start site that create binding motifs for E-twenty six/ternary complex factors (Ets/TCF), affected 65. 4 % of the tumors, with even distribution across different stages and grades. Our data showed that a common polymorphism rs 2853669, within a preexisting Ets 2 binding site in the TERT promoter, acts as a modifier of the effect of the mutations on survival and tumor recurrence. The patients with the mutations showed poor survival in the absence [hazard ratio (HR) 2. 19, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 02 - 4. 70] but not in the presence (HR 0. 42, 95 % CI 0. 18 - 1. 01) of the variant allele of the polymorphism. The mutations in the absence of the variant allele were highly associated with the disease recurrence in patients with Tis, Ta, and T 1 tumors (HR 1. 85, 95 % CI 1. 11 - 3. 08). The TERT promoter mutations are the most common <b>somatic</b> <b>lesions</b> in bladder cancer with clinical implications. The association of the mutations with patient survival and disease recurrence, subject to modification by a common polymorphism, can be a unique putative marker with individualized prognostic potential...|$|E
40|$|Expression of the Na+/I- symporter (NIS) gene was {{investigated}} by RT- PCR in a selected series of 26 primary thyroid carcinomas (19 papillary, 5 follicular, and 2 anaplastic). Fifteen follicular adenomas (11 'cold' and 4 'hot' adenomas) were also studied. Five of 19 papillary thyroid cancer did not express NIS messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). In all but i follicular cancer, NIS transcript was fully detected. In anaplastic tissue, NIS mRNA was only barely detected in 1 case. All of the follicular thyroid adenomas except 1 expressed the NIS gene. In contrast, all tumors studied excluding the anaplastic histotype fully expressed thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase mRNA transcripts. In 2 patients, a lower expression (3 - to 5 -fold) of NIS mRNA {{was found in}} metastasis by dot blot analysis compared with those in both normal and primary neoplastic thyroid tissue. Four of 8 differentiated thyroid cancer patients selected {{for the presence of}} metastases with negative posttherapy 131 I total body scan showed the lack of NIS gene expression in their primary cancer. This defect, at least in these cases, is a <b>somatic</b> and intrinsic <b>lesion</b> of the primary cancer cells and is not due to a dedifferentiation process in the metastatic tissue. The early detection of the loss of NIS gene expression in the primary cancer, therefore, may provide useful information for the management of differentiated thyroid cancer patients...|$|R
40|$|Childhood {{cutaneous}} melanoma is a {{rare disease}} with increasing incidence. It {{is not clear whether}} it differs from adult melanoma in etiology and clinical evolution. To genetically characterize childhood melanoma, 21 pediatric patients were studied by germ-line analysis of CDKN 2 A, CDK 4, and MC 1 R genes. In addition, alterations in CDKN 2 A, c-Kit, BRAF, and NRAS genes were evaluated at the somatic level by direct gene sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, and immunohistochemistry. As a control group of susceptible patients, we studied patients from 23 melanoma-prone families. At the germ-line level, CDKN 2 A and MC 1 R gene variants were detected in 2 / 21 and 12 / 21 pediatric patients and in 9 / 23 and 19 / 22 in familial patients. At the <b>somatic</b> level, most <b>lesions</b> (9 / 14) from pediatric patients showed CDKN 2 A locus homozygous deletions and a null p 16 immunophenotype, whereas most lesions (5 / 8) from familial patients were disomic and immunoreactive. A c-Kit low-polysomy profile seems to parallel CDKN 2 A homozygous deletions in pediatric melanoma whereas the single activating mutation observed segregates with familial patients. Loss of KIT protein expression was frequent (7 / 14) in pediatric melanomas, where metastatic cases were prevalent. BRAFV 600 E mutation occurred at a similar rate (∼ 50 %) in lesions from pediatric and familial patients, whereas no NRAS mutations were detected...|$|R
40|$|High-grade {{pancreatic}} intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-PanIN) is {{the major}} precursor of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and is an ideal target for early detection. To characterize pure HG-PanIN, we analysed 23 isolated HG-PanIN lesions occurring {{in the absence of}} PDAC. Whole-exome sequencing of five of these HG-PanIN lesions revealed a median of 33 <b>somatic</b> mutations per <b>lesion,</b> with a total of 318 mutated genes. Targeted next-generation sequencing of 17 HG-PanIN lesions identified KRAS mutations in 94 % of the lesions. CDKN 2 A alterations occurred in six HG-PanIN lesions, and RNF 43 alterations in five. Mutations in TP 53, GNAS, ARID 1 A, PIK 3 CA, and TGFBR 2 were limited to one or two HG-PanINs. No non-synonymous mutations in SMAD 4 were detected. Immunohistochemistry for p 53 and SMAD 4 proteins in 18 HG-PanINs confirmed the paucity of alterations in these genes, with aberrant p 53 labelling noted only in three lesions, two of which were found to be wild type in sequencing analyses. Sixteen adjacent LG-PanIN lesions from ten patients were also sequenced using targeted sequencing. LG-PanIN harboured KRAS mutations in 94 % of the lesions; mutations in CDKN 2 A, TP 53, and SMAD 4 were not identified. These results suggest that inactivation of TP 53 and SMAD 4 are late genetic alterations, predominantly occurring in invasive PDAC. Copyright © 2017 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

40|$|Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1) {{is mainly}} {{characterized}} by the occurrence of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors or neurofibromas. Thorough investigation of the somatic mutation spectrum has thus far been hampered by the large size of the NF 1 gene and the considerable proportion of NF 1 heterozygous cells within the tumors. We developed an improved somatic mutation detection strategy on cultured Schwann cells derived from neurofibromas and investigated 38 tumors from nine NF 1 patients. Twenty-nine <b>somatic</b> NF 1 <b>lesions</b> were detected which represents the highest NF 1 somatic mutation detection rate described so far (76 %). Furthermore, our data strongly suggest that the acquired second hit underlies reduced NF 1 expression in Schwann cell cultures. Together, these data clearly illustrate that two inactivating NF 1 mutations, in a subpopulation of the Schwann cells, are required for neurofibroma formation in NF 1 tumorigenesis. The observed somatic mutation spectrum shows that intragenic NF 1 mutations (26 / 29) are most prevalent, particularly frameshift mutations (12 / 29, 41 %). We hypothesize that this mutation signature might reflect slightly reduced DNA repair efficiency as a trigger for NF 1 somatic inactivation preceding tumorigenesis. Joint analysis of the current and previously published NF 1 mutation data revealed {{a significant difference in}} the somatic mutation spectrum in patients with a NF 1 microdeletion vs. non-microdeletion patients with respect to the prevalence of loss of heterozygosity events (0 / 15 vs. 41 / 81). Differences in somatic inactivation mechanism might therefore exist between NF 1 microdeletion patients and the general NF 1 population. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Neurofibromatosis type- 1 (NF 1), {{caused by}} {{heterozygous}} inactivation of the NF 1 tumour suppressor gene, {{is associated with}} the development of benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs). Although numerous germline NF 1 mutations have been identified, relatively few somatic NF 1 mutations have been described in neurofibromas. Here we have screened 109 cutaneous neurofibromas, excised from 46 unrelated NF 1 patients, for somatic NF 1 mutations. NF 1 mutation screening (involving loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) analysis, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and DNA sequencing) identified 77 somatic NF 1 point mutations, of which 53 were novel. LOH spanning the NF 1 gene region was evident in 25 neurofibromas, but in contrast to previous data from MPNSTs, it was absent at the TP 53, CDKN 2 A and RB 1 gene loci. Analysis of DNA/RNA from neurofibroma-derived Schwann cell cultures revealed NF 1 mutations in four tumours whose presence had been overlooked in the tumour DNA. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that four of seven novel somatic NF 1 missense mutations (p. A 330 T, p. Q 519 P, p. A 776 T, p. S 1463 F) could be of functional/clinical significance. Functional analysis confirmed this prediction for p. S 1463 F, located within the GTPase-activating protein-related domain, as this mutation resulted in a 150 -fold increase in activated GTP-bound Ras. Comparison of the relative frequencies of the different types of somatic NF 1 mutation observed with those of their previously reported germline counterparts revealed significant (P= 0. 001) differences. Although non-identical somatic mutations involving either the same or adjacent nucleotides were identified in three pairs of tumours from the same patients (P< 0. 0002), no association was noted between the type of germline and <b>somatic</b> NF 1 <b>lesion</b> within the same individual.

40|$|Background: Although {{asbestos}} acts as {{a potent}} carcinogen in pleural mesothelial and pulmonary epithelial cells, it still remains unclear whether asbestos causes specific and characteristic gene alterations in these different kinds of target cells, because direct comparison in an identical patient is not feasible. We experienced a rare synchronous collision tumor composed of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma (PAC) in a 77 -year-old man {{with a history of}} long-term smoking and asbestos exposure, and compared the DNA copy number alteration (CNA) and somatic mutation in these two independent tumors. Methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues of MPM and PAC lesions from the surgically resected specimen were used. Each of these MPM and PAC lesions exhibited a typical histology and immunophenotype. CNA analysis using SNP array was performed using the Illumina Human Omni Express- 12 _FFPE (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with DNA extracts from each <b>lesion.</b> <b>Somatic</b> mutation analysis using next-generation sequencing was performed using the TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel (Illumina). Results: The CNA analysis demonstrated a marked difference in the frequency of gain and loss between MPM and PAC. In PAC, copy number (CN) gain was detected more frequently and widely than CN loss, whereas in MPM there was no such obvious difference. PAC did not harbor CNAs that have been identified in asbestos-associated lung cancer, but did harbor some of the CNAs associated with smoking. MPM exhibited CN loss at 9 p 21. 2 - 3, which is the most common genetic alteration in mesothelioma. Conclusion: In this particular case, asbestos exposure may not have played a primary role in PAC carcinogenesis, but cigarette smoking may have contributed more to the occurrence of CN gains in PAC. This comparative genetic analysis of two different lesions with same amount of asbestos exposure and cigarette smoke exposure has provided information on differences in the cancer genome related to carcinogenesis...|$|R

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by the American Fisheries Society {{and can be}} found at: [URL] high prevalence of vertebral deformities has been observed in various fishes, especially cyprinids, from certain regions of the Willamette River for many years. One proposed source of these deformities is exposure to toxicants. Histological evaluation of affected chiselmouth Acrocheilus alutaceus revealed that all lesions associated with vertebrae were associated with metacercariae of digenean trematodes. Approximately half of the northern pikeminnow Ptychocheilus oregonensis had infections in which metacercariae were associated with these lesions. Metacercariae were also associated with vertebral lesions in three of four affected peamouth Mylocheilus caurinus. Many metacercariae that were present within the vertebral bodies were associated with bony dysplasia and bony proliferation in all three species. We also evaluated the association of the metacercariae with the vertebral deformities, using intact fish that had been cleared with trypsin. Fish from the affected regions had a much higher prevalence of metacercariae and deformities and a greater abundance of metacercariae than those in the reference site. Chiselmouths had more deformities and metacercariae than northern pikeminnow. In all fish species, 77 % of deformities were directly associated with metacercariae; in chiselmouths, about 95 % of the deformities exhibited this relationship. Two types of metacercariae were identified in affected fish: Apophallus sp. (Heterophyidae) and a neascus type (Strigeidida). The Apophallus sp. appeared to be more closely associated with the skeleton deformities. A Myxobolus sp. morphologically similar to M. cyprini was also associated with the vertebral lesions in about 50 % of the northern pikeminnow and 5 % of the chiselmouths. Intact plasmodia were found in <b>somatic</b> muscle, and <b>lesions</b> containing free spores were often located at bone surfaces. This survey demonstrates that metacercariae (probably Apophallus sp.) and a Myxobolus sp. are major causes of the vertebral deformities seen in cyprinid fishes from certain regions of the Willamette River...|$|R
40|$|Although a cell {{produces}} {{an assortment of}} products that protect, inspect and if necessary heal its valuable genetic code, DNA-mutations can accumulate during a cell’s life cycle. This is exemplified by the acquisition of <b>somatic</b> genetic <b>lesions</b> that cause cancer, {{but also by the}} birth of disabled children due to a genomic aberration acquired during gametogenesis or early embryogenesis. In fact, most likely we all are genetic mosaics early on or later in our life, with part of our cells containing a genetic repertoire that deviates from the original zygotic genome. As a consequence, the ability to characterize the entire genome of a single human cell for all classes of genetic variation is important to unravel the extent, nature and consequences of this mosaicism, as well as to establish {{a better understanding of the}} underlying genomic instability during processes like gametogenesis, embryogenesis and tumorigenesis. Single-cell sequencing is thus an invaluable tool not only for basic genome research but also for enabling novel clinical applications (e. g. profiling circulating tumor cells from peripheral blood of a cancer patient to guide the patient’s treatment using ‘liquid biopsies’ of solid tumours). At the start of my Ph. D., single-cell sequencing did not exist. Before the genome of a single cell can be analyzed on current high-throughput sequencing platforms, its genome must be amplified thousands of times to obtain enough input material. This step of whole genome amplification (WGA) poses a tremendous challenge, as it delivers a biased representation of the original genome, containing amplification artifacts that resemble real genetic variants. In chapter 4 of this dissertation we developed a method for paired-end sequencing of single-cell genomes, which exploits paired-end mapping and single nucleotide variant information for sifting WGA-artifacts from true unbalanced copy number variants. In addition, we were able to demonstrate for the first time the detection of inter- and intra-chromosomal structural rearrangements in a single cell. In addition to WGA-bias, ongoing DNA-replication poses another challenge for single-cell genomics. A snapshot of a diploid cell in S-phase demonstrates consecutive loci of copy number state 2, 3 or 4. The number of these loci, their size and copy number state is dynamic over the entire S-phase. In chapter 3 of this dissertation we used single-cell array comparative genomic hybridization to demonstrate that such ongoing DNA-replication negatively impacts reliable copy number profiling of the cell. When analyzing cells randomly selected from a population and without knowing their cell cycle phase, this can lead to misinterpretation of the cell’s copy number profile. In chapter 5 we developed a methodology based on single-cell sequencing for the detection of S-phase genomes in a population of sequenced diploid cells, and allowing the emergence of the genome-wide DNA-replication program of a single cell at high resolution. Recently it has been found that the first cleavage divisions of human life following in vitro fertilization (IVF) are prone to chromosome instability (CIN). Several observations suggest that also in vivo human embryogenesis is affected by such instability. In chapter 6, we combined single-cell sequencing of all available blastomeres of human cleavage stage embryos with live-cell imaging of the embryos’ development since conception. Reading the genome of each cell at high resolution combined with valuable information about cell division, cell behavior and morphology delivered deeper insight in the operation of CIN during human embryogenesis. We discovered novel natures of chromosome rearrangement including interstitial (submicroscopic) copy number variants, as well as novel mechanisms of CIN including the absorption of a polar body by a blastomere with subsequent vast centric fission following division of this blastomere. In addition, we delivered unambiguous proof for the occurrence of breakage fusion bridge cycles during the first cell cycles of human life, a mechanism of chromosome rearrangement frequently observed in cancer. At the moment, genomic disorders and constitutional de novo DNA-rearrangements are mainly considered to result from pre-meiotic or meiotic germ line errors. However, depending on which blastomere(s) contribute(s) to the inner cell mass and embryo proper, this CIN during embryogenesis may be a source of not only pregnancy loss, but hypothetically also of genomic disorders and constitutional de novo structural variants (SVs), including de novo DNA copy number variants (CNVs). To gain insight in the evolutionary conservation of CIN during embryogenesis, we studied genome stability at different time-points of mouse embryogenesis in chapter 7. Unexpectedly, we found the genome of mouse embryos to be much more stable than observed in human embryos, providing a stepping-stone for further research towards the identification of the molecular mechanisms underlying CIN. status: publishe...|$|R
