40|$|To {{determine}} the contaminants {{that should be}} studied further in the subsequent population-based study, a profile of Great Lakes (GL) <b>sport</b> <b>fish</b> contaminant residues were studied in human blood and urine specimens from 32 <b>sport</b> <b>fish</b> consumers from three Great Lakes: Lake Michigan (n = 10), Lake Huron (n = 11), and Lake Erie (n = 11). Serum was analyzed for 8 polychlorinated dioxin congeners, 10 polychlorinated furan congeners, 4 coplanar and 32 other polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, and 11 persistent chlorinated pesticides. Whole blood was analyzed for mercury and lead. Urine samples were analyzed for 10 nonpersistent pesticides (or their metabolites) and 5 metals. One individual was excluded from statistical analysis because of an unusual exposure to selected analytes. Overall, the sample (n = 31) consumed, on average, 49 GL <b>sport</b> <b>fish</b> meals per year for a mean of 33 years. On average, the general population in the GL basin consume 6 meals of GL <b>sport</b> <b>fish</b> per year. The mean tissue levels of most persistent, bioaccumulative compounds also found in GL <b>sport</b> <b>fish</b> ranged from less than a twofold increase to that of PCB 126, which was eight times the selected background levels found {{in the general population}}. The overall mean total toxic equivalent for dioxins, furans, and coplanar PCBs were greater than selected background levels in the general population (dioxins, 1. 8 times; furans, 2. 4 times; and coplanar PCBs, 9. 6 times). The nonpersistent pesticides and most metals were not identified in unusual concentrations. A contaminant pattern among lake subgroups was evident. Lake Erie <b>sport</b> <b>fish</b> consumers had consistently lower contaminant concentrations than consumers of <b>sport</b> <b>fish</b> from Lake Michigan and Huron. These interlake differences are consistent with contaminant patterns seen in <b>sport</b> <b>fish</b> tissue from the respective lakes; GL <b>sport</b> <b>fish</b> consumption was the most likely explanation for observed contaminant levels among this sample. Frequent consumers of <b>sport</b> <b>fish</b> proved to be effective sentinels for identifying <b>sport</b> <b>fish</b> contaminants of concern. In the larger study to follow, serum samples will be tested for PCBs (congener specific and coplanar), DDE, dioxin, and furans...|$|R
40|$|Nationwide, 45 states issue health {{advisories}} for <b>sport</b> <b>fish</b> consumers. Chemical {{contaminants in}} some Great Lakes (GL) <b>sport</b> <b>fish</b> include compounds suspected of causing adverse reproductive and developmental effects. Although advisories to reduce consumption of contaminated fish, especially by women, {{have been issued}} by GL states (i. e., Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) since the mid- 1970 s, {{little is known about}} advisory awareness and GL <b>sport</b> <b>fish</b> consumption in the general population. To estimate the prevalence of GL <b>sport</b> <b>fish</b> consumption and health advisory awareness, we conducted a population-based telephone survey of 8, 306 adult residents of the eight GL states. We gathered information concerning respondents' demographic characteristics, fish consumption during the preceding year, and <b>sport</b> <b>fish</b> consumption advisory awareness. The survey response rate was 69 %. GL <b>sport</b> <b>fish</b> were eaten during the preceding year by 8. 4 % - 95 % confidence interval (CI), 7. 6 - 9. 2 - of adults in the GL states, approximately 4. 7 million persons. Women accounted for 43. 9 % (CI, 39. 4 - 48. 4) of consumers. Although 49. 9 % of GL <b>sport</b> <b>fish</b> consumers were aware of a health advisory, awareness varied significantly by sex: 58. 2 % (CI, 51. 7 - 64. 7) of males and 39. 1 % (CI, 32. 6 - 45. 6) of females were aware. Using logistic regression, we found awareness associated with male sex -odds ratio (OR) = 2. 3; CI, 1. 5 - 3. 5), white race (OR = 4. 2; CI, 1. 9 - 9. 1), college degree (OR = 3. 1; CI, 1. 3 - 7. 6), and consuming >= 24 GL <b>sport</b> <b>fish</b> meals/year (OR = 2. 4; CI, 1. 4 - 4. 3). Only half of GL <b>sport</b> <b>fish</b> consumers reported awareness of a health advisory concerning eating GL <b>sport</b> <b>fish.</b> Awareness was especially low among women, suggesting the need of targeted risk communication programs for female consumers...|$|R
5|$|Marine {{activities}} are mostly {{located on the}} Bay (eastern) side of the peninsula, where there are three yacht clubs, including the San Diego Yacht Club, which was home to the America's Cup from 1988 to 1995.

5|$|John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company was {{centered}} on Mackinac Island after the War of 1812 and exported beaver pelts for thirty years. By {{the middle of}} the 19th century, commercial fishing for common whitefish and lake trout began to replace the fur trade as the island's primary industry.

5|$|Rivers {{and streams}} in the Colorado basin were once home to 49 species of native fish, of which 42 were endemic. Engineering {{projects}} and river regulation {{have led to}} the extinction of four species and severe declines in the populations of 40 species. Bonytail chub, razorback sucker, Colorado pikeminnow, and humpback chub are among those considered the most at risk; all are unique to the Colorado River system and well adapted to the river's natural silty conditions and flow variations. Clear, cold water released by dams has significantly changed characteristics of habitat for these and other Colorado River basin fishes. A further 40 species that occur in the river today, notably the brown trout, were introduced during the 19th and 20thcenturies, mainly for <b>sport</b> <b>fishing.</b>|$|E

5|$|The first fish {{descriptions}} from Puerto Rico {{were compiled}} by Cuvier and Valenciennes in 1828. They reported 33 taxa for the archipelago. Puerto Rico has few native freshwater fish species; however, {{there are over}} 30 introduced species, mainly originating from Africa, South America and the southeastern United States, have established populations, and 60 marine species use Puerto Rico's freshwater bodies intermittently during the year. Introductions have been intentional and accidental. The purposes of intentional introductions have been <b>sport</b> <b>fishing</b> for recreation and food, mosquito control, and to provide baitfish for largemouth bass. Accidental introductions, such as the sailfin armored catfish (Pterygoplichthys multiradiatus), are mainly attributed {{to the release of}} aquarium fish. Since 1936, the Puerto Rican Department of Natural and Environmental Resources runs a hatchery at the municipality of Maricao. About 25,000 fish, including largemouth bass, peacock bass, and channel catfish, and some turtle species are raised annually to stock Puerto Rico's reservoirs and rivers.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} fish in India was also {{initially}} restricted to that which was of commercial value. <b>Sport</b> <b>fishing</b> was also popular but restricted to major hill areas. Not much is documented of the <b>sport</b> <b>fishing</b> beyond record catches reported in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. Notable publications on the fishes of India were made by Sir Francis Day (1829–1889), Captain Robert Cecil Beavan (1841–1870) and Francis Buchanan-Hamilton (1762–1829).
