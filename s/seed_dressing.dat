40|$|Hill bunt or stinking smut {{of wheat}} is a seed borne disease of wheat {{in the hills}} of Uttaranchal. It is caused by Tilletia foetida (wallr) Liro and T. caries (D. C.) Tul that cause {{considerable}} loss to the crop in the hills of Uttaranchal. The disease appears in the form of swollen grains full of smut spores. The minimal incidence of this disease has been reported to degrade the quality of grain and wheat flour, which make the entire seed lot unfit for chapati making (4). Holton (1967) reported 25 - 50 % reduction in yield due to hill bunt (1). The present study was under taken to find out photosynthetic loss due to hill bunt disease and also to see the efficacy of Oxalis and Cannabis plant extract for its control.

From 2002 to 2007 we compared the effects of two soil management and two fertilization modalities in an upland rice-based cropping system on soil macrofauna abundance, diversity and BB damage to rice crops and yield. This cropping system involved a 2 -year rotation of upland rice the first year, followed by common bean the second year, with oat as a relay crop under both conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage soil management (NT), each under both organic (OF) and mineral fertilization (MF). All four modalities (CT-OF; CT-MF; NT-OF and NT-MF) were managed under two plant protection levels (<b>seed</b> <b>dressing</b> with imidacloprid + thiram vs no <b>seed</b> <b>dressing).</b> Herbivorous/detritivorous beetles were the most abundant soil biota, respectively representing more than two-thirds and half of all macrofauna {{at the outset of}} the experiment and 4 years later, with the BB Heteronychus arator rugifrons (Fairmaire) being the dominant pest species (herbivore).

40|$|Cowpea is {{the most}} {{important}} grain legume in Nigeria. The crop plays a soil fertility restorative role in farming systems. Its protein-rich grains are widely consumed and the haulms are fed livestock. However, its production is constrained by fungal attacks at all stages of its growth, amongst other socio-economic factors. Some of these diseases which affect the crop are seed-borne and seed transmissible. Their control has been by use of synthetic fungicides. But these are associated with discouraging drawbacks on human and eco-health. Alternatively, plant extracts are being screened as sources of novel fungicides. This study evaluated in vitro two concentrations (30 % and 50 %) of extracts from Caricapapaya (roots, seeds, leaves) and Piper guineense (seeds, leaves) as seed-dressing phytochemicals on the germination of cowpea seeds and the incidence of the seed-borne fungi. The seeds were soaked in each concentration of the crude aqueous extracts for 12 hr, removed and air-dried at room temperature for 8 hr. The treated seeds were then plated on solidified PDA in Petri dishes and incubated for 7 days in the inoculation chamber. The dishes were arranged in completely randomized design (CRD), made up of 6 treatments and 5 replicates giving 300 seeds for each concentration. The results showed generally that the germination profile was better (p< 0. 05) at the 30 % rate of application than 50 %. Regardless of dosage of treatment, cowpea <b>seeds</b> <b>dressed</b> in Carica papaya root extracts gave 100 % germination while those treated with Piper guineense failed to germinate. This study also affirmed that species of Fusarium, Colletotrichum, Curvularia, Mucor and Aspergillus were associated with seeds of cowpea variety IAR- 48. It indicated that C. papaya root and P. guineense seed extracts significantly (p< 0. 05) gave a better reduction of these seed-borne fungi. At 30 % concentration, the mean incidences were 19. 20 % and 4. 80 % while 5. 20 % and 0. 00 % were obtained from 50 % dosage respectively. Though 50 % concentration of the extracts generally gave a higher reduction of the fungal load in the cowpea seeds, in other words a better control of the organisms, the germination of the treated seeds were significantly (p< 0. 05) better with 30 % concentration. Hence, aqueous root extracts of C. papaya could be used as effective seed-dressing phytochemical in IPM programmes for the control of seed-borne fungi of cowpea for improved productivity.

The light factor has the biggest influence of all factors on germination of Agrostis stolonifera (Penn G- 2, Providence), Poa supina (Supranova) and Poa pratensis (Julius, Julius PreGerm). All these species had germination evidential higher in the light, than in the dark. With species Poa pratensis (Coctail, Coctail Headstart) and Poa annua were not observed any essential variations between the dark and the light variants. Only with Poa annua there were reached noticeably lower values with variant in the light, where was used polyethyleneglycol, than in the dark. The analysis of variance demonstrated, that the biggest influence had the factor of stratification together with the light factor with Agrostis capilaris (Bardot) and Agrostis stolonifera Providence. With Poa annua there was established the biggest influence of the light factor together with the factor of the used medium. The factor of stratification noticeably affected only the germination of Agrostis capillaris Bardot. The germination of Agrostis stolonifera Providence, Poa pratensis Cocktail, Cocktail Headstart, Julius and Poa annua was not noticeably affected by stratification. The reaction on the factor of stratification was with Agrostis capillaris Bardot in the dark adverse and in the light minimal.

With Poa supina Supranova it was not the most important factor, but still affected the germination significiantly. The nitrogen nutrition, as the next factor, had positive affect with all variants. This could be explained with existence of the „gap detection“ mechanism. Especially variants in the dark and with used stratification had affected theirs germination positively, when combinated with H 2 O and potassium nitrate. The addition of potassium nitrate positively affected also the energy of germination. With the lack of water factor was affected amount of germinated caryopsis and their energy of germination. Especially with higher water tonus was energy of germination and germination itself decreased. The only exceptions were these variants in the dark with the stratification factor. With these conditions was achieved the same or even higher quality of germination of variants, where PEG was added than was achieved with H 2 O variants...|$|R
40|$|The {{integrated}} {{effect of}} 15 controllable factors of soybean fields on diseases and insect pests, natural enemies and soybean yield was studied from 1993 to 1995. According to {{the criterion of}} good control to the pests, increase of soybean yield and protection of natural enemies, the 16 controllable factors were evaluated synthetically and the optimum system control to the disease and insect pests of summer soybeans were suggested as follows: soybean sown in the same maize hole (4 to 1) or soybeans interplanted in the maize field (9 to 2 rows), cultivar the variety ludou 4, sowing time on about 10 June, <b>dressing</b> <b>seed</b> with trace element fertilizer at 1800 g/hm 2, dosages of fertilizer N,P 2 O 5,K 2 O and Organic manure application at 45 kg/hm 2, 60 kg/hm 2, 150 kg/hm 2 and 22500 kg/hm 2 respectively. Mixture <b>dressing</b> <b>seeds</b> with phorate and carbendazim 0. 36 % and 0. 1 % of seed weight respectively, control soybean aphid with pirimicarb at 60 g/hm 2, control soil insect with isofenphos-methyl at 67. 5 g/hm 2, and control leaf-eating insects and soybean borer with Bt at 3000 g/hm 2. The technologies of optimum system control to the diseases and insect pests were made up in the three different modes including soybean sown in the same maize hole, soybeans interplanted in the maize field and monoculture soybeans. It demonstrated that the three techniques were significantly characterized by a good control to the dOriginating text in Chinese.

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{salinity}} at different molar concentrations (0 mM, 40 mM and 120 mM) and T- 22 i Planter Box (active ingredient—Trichoderma harzianum) applied as a <b>seed</b> coat <b>dressing,</b> on shoot length, dry weight and amounts of Na+ in two maize varieties (F 1 Earlypak and F 1 Baby corn) was investigated. Although a rapid assay assessment for Baby corn showed {{a significant increase in}} growth in T- 22 treated seeds, this was not reflected in results obtained after 35 days at all salinity levels. There was a significant 10. 4 % and 12. 2 % (control and 40 mM, respectively) decrease in plant dry weight for Trichoderma treated Baby corn. Results for F 1 Earlypak showed no significant difference in shoot length, dry weight and amounts of Na+ in treated and untreated plants. The lack of effect of T- 22 i Planter Box on the growth of maize may be explained by the small amount of the fungus reaching the soil (104 – 105 cfu/seed), resulting in a population of only 103 cfu/g soil compared with 106 cfu/g soil in experiments conducted using isolates of T- 22 in a wheat bran/peat mixture or as a conidial suspension...|$|R
