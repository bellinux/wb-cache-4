40|$|Pilot {{response}} in a multi-task simulation, {{which consisted of}} a primary cotitrol task combined {{with one or two}} secondary or side control tasks, was investigated. A general description of the response character-istics of each of these tasks was obtained and this information was used to determine the work-load requirements of the tasks. Two different control tasks were used as tire primary control task, either a fixed-base simulation of a lunar letdown or a simplified multi-loop tracking task wliicii was similar to the endportion of the lunar letdown. Tlie simplified Iracking task was used in lieu of tire more compli-cated lunar letdown because it could be represented and reproduced analytically. The secondary or <b>side</b> <b>tasks</b> consisted of a system failures task and a motor response task. The system failures task was iti-corporated from those systems present in a veliicle known as tire Mercury Procedures Trainer.

40|$|The {{self-driving}} vehicle {{has been widely}} presented in the media as a concept {{in the last few}} years and many companies, such as Volkswagen, are working on the technology. The autonomous technology promises to bring an easier and safer journey. By sensing the surround environment, the car will drive by itself allowing the driver to enjoy his or her qualitative time on the way. However, deliver the technology to the market might not be an easy task due to its potential disruptive characteristics. There should be an initial phase that can introduce the technology to people, involve and take them smoothly to the fully autonomous experience. The high-autonomous vehicle can take the role of intermediation between steering and controlling. Although it does not allow the driver to sleep or be mentally far away from the task of guiding the vehicle, the high-automated technology will give some freedom to the conductor for performing some <b>side</b> <b>tasks</b> not allowed today. This study will focus on understanding how to find real business opportunities for high-autonomous vehicles, and deliver meaningful values to customers and users within a practical case at Volkswagen A.

Three research questions are responsible for shaping this study: “What are the benefits the high-autonomous vehicle can bring to drivers?” “Who are the users/customers that would value those bene-fits?” and “How to generate revenue from this service/product?” By answering them, potential product-service system scenarios as well as business model canvas are created and presented. Beyond answering the research questions, the study tries to transform a technology push into a need pull situation by balancing the three main important multidisciplinary constraints: feasibility, viability and desirability.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{primates}} {{are sensitive to the}} velocity of moving objects. We can also remember velocity information after moving objects disappear. This cognitive faculty has been investigated before, however, the literature on velocity memory to date has been fragmented. For example, velocity memory has been disparately described as a system that controls eye movements and delayed discrimination. Furthermore, velocity memory may have a role in motion extrapolation, i. e. the ability to judge the position of a moving target after it becomes occluded. This thesis provides a unifying account of velocity memory, and uses electroencephalography (EEG) to explore its neural basis. In Chapter 2, the relationship between oculomotor control and motion extrapolation was investigated. Two forms of motion extrapolation task were presented. In the first, participants observed a moving target disappear then reappear further along its path. Reappearance could be at the correct time, too early or too late. Participants discriminated reappearance error with a two-alternative forced choice button press. In the second task, participants saw identical targets travel behind a visible occluder, and they attempted to press a button at the exact time that it reached the other <b>side.</b> <b>Tasks</b> were completed under fixation and free viewing conditions. The accuracy of participant's judgments was reduced by fixation in both tasks. In addition, eye movements were systematically related to behavioural responses, and small eye movements during fixation were affected by occluded motion. These three results imply that common velocity memory and pre-motor systems mediate eye movements and motion extrapolation. In Chapter 3, different types of velocity representation were explored. Another motion extrapolation task was presented, and targets of a particular colour were associated with fast or slow motion. On identical-velocity probe trials, colour still influenced response times. This indicates that long-term colour-velocity associations influence motion extrapolation. In Chapter 4, interference between subsequently encoded velocities was explored. There was robust interference between motion extrapolation and delayed discrimination tasks, suggesting that common processes are involved in both. In Chapter 5, EEG was used to investigate when memory-guided tracking begins during motion extrapolation. This study compared conditions where participants covertly tracked visible and occluded targets. It was found that a specific event related potential (ERP) appeared around 200 ms post occlusion, irrespective of target location or velocity. This component could delineate the onset of memory guided tracking during occlusion. Finally, Chapter 6 presents evidence that a change in alpha band activity is associated with information processing during motion extrapolation tasks. In light of these results, it is concluded that a common velocity memory system is involved a variety of tasks. In the general discussion (Chapter 7), a new account of velocity memory is proposed. It is suggested that a velocity memory reflects persistent synchronization across several velocity sensitive neural populations after stimulus offset. This distributed network is involved in sensory-motor integration, and can remain active without visual input. Theoretical work on eye movements, delayed discrimination and motion extrapolation could benefit from this account of velocity memory. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{civilian}} protection, and suggests solutions based on the peculiar characteristics of such scenarios, specifically the severe limitations in testing an underwater detection system {{in the field and}} the limited economic resources available. The first part of this work focuses directly on the main security problem, describing a new approach, based on simulating tools, to analyze and verify harbours protection levels. Traditionally based on trial-and-error methodologies, building an underwater anti-intrusion system is a complex operation, starting from choosing the right sensors to be placed in the specific scenario to configuration deployments into the water. Using a simulating tool can be an efficient way to get better information on the anti-intrusion behaviour before dipping any sensor into the water and then with a very limited influence on the normal port activities. More specifically this could even be the only solution for civilian ports protection. The simulator tool is based on a GIS architecture, acoustic and magnetic sensor models and an event driven simulator to simulate the sensors performance in their relation with the specific sea environment and intruder classes (diver, ships, etc), providing operational and ready-for-action data in order to build or modify an anti-intrusion system. The second part describes four low-cost monitoring systems for marine areas and the major problems connected with the underwater localization. All the systems, based on passive acoustic hydrophones, can be used to protect and monitor non-critical zones such as fishing farming installations, archaeological sites or protected marine areas, and in general in situation in which access may be always or temporary forbidden to unauthorized personnel. The first system shown is based on only one hydrophone, using a very simple acoustic propagation model, to track and localize the threat. Two and three hydrophones systems are then described making the installation more complex and expensive but effectively increasing the localization performance and reliability. Finally, the discussion goes further using an autonomous underwater vehicle with very limited computational and signal acquisition capabilities to localize a fixed underwater source of sound. In this part the problem is not in the localization itself, for the vehicle can carry up to four hydrophones, a number that is sufficient to localize exactly a sound source in a three dimensional scenario, while the challenge is in the very limited vehicle acquisition resources which make useless all the traditional localization algorithms based on reliable signal delays among the hydrophones. Besides, while the security problem has to be investigated directly, underlining systems performance with respect to specific threats, on the other side, it involves even several <b>side</b> <b>tasks</b> that have to be accomplished to make the general one completed. Protecting marine areas means having the best knowledge of the areas we are interested in, and then providing a large amount of data both from historical databases and from new experiments in order to get up-to-date geographic and environmental information. The third part of the thesis is in fact related to a very important but side field in the whole security aspect and it concerns with marine areas exploration through a platoon of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) performing point-wise measurements or observations. The proposed algorithms, based on a fuzzy like approach or on the use of radial basis functions (RBFs), allow to adapt vehicles exploration to the specific conditions the agents are into, without any need of an a-priori knowledge of the mission area, incrementally controlling the approximation error of the overall environmental quantity as the mission goes on and new scattered data are provided. The algorithms can be applied to more general cases in which point-wise measurements are required and mobile sensors networks are used, even though, in this thesis, they are especially aimed to environmental monitoring and exploration of oceanic regions...|$|E
