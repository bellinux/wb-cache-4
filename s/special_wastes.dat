5000|$|In December 1978, the EPA {{issued its}} {{proposed}} RCRA regulations. For RCRA Subtitle C (hazardous waste management), the EPA defined six categories of “special wastes,” which were generated in high volumes and {{were believed to}} be less hazardous than the other wastes for which RCRA Subtitle C was designed. Among the <b>special</b> <b>wastes</b> were included cement kiln dust, fly ash, mining wastes, and wastes from oil, gas, and geothermal exploration and production. The oil, gas, and geothermal wastes included drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with oil and natural gas exploration, development, or production. [...] The EPA proposed that regulation of <b>special</b> <b>wastes</b> under Subtitle C, be deferred until further study.|$|E
5000|$|Special Waste: Six {{categories}} of waste were given deferral from hazardous waste requirements by EPA under proposed hazardous waste management regulations. This special category of wastes was maintained until further human health and environmental risk assessments could be completed. As per this deferral, the six {{categories of}} special waste are 1) Cement kiln dust, 2) Mining waste, 3) oil and gas drilling muds and oil production brines, 4) beneficiation and processing waste from phosphate rock mining, 5) uranium waste, and 6) utility or fossil fuel combustion waste. The difference between <b>special</b> <b>wastes</b> and other wastes is the large volume of generation of special waste at a time leading to less human and environmental risk.|$|E

40|$|Under {{controlled}} conditions waste-to-energy {{plants are}} very useful systems to dispose solid wastes {{in combination with}} energy production. For common urban wastes, hence excluding <b>special</b> <b>wastes,</b> the incineration products are fly and heavy ashes where heavy metals are concentrated due to their impossibility to be vaporized. Those metals are usually lost because up to now the common ashes disposal methods have been cement or clay inertization or simple ashes storage in safe places. In order to recover those otherwise lost valuable and useful heavy metals we present {{the concept of an}} electromagnetic device able to separate and collect the different atomic species. The proposed device is essentially composed by an atomization stage followed by a separation one. The former atomizes and ionizes ash components allowing the second stage to perform separation of the desired metals by means of an electromagnetic field. Power dissipation represents one of the major issues of such devices due to the high power required to perform species separation.

40|$|Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is an {{environmental}} policy approach {{under which the}} responsibility of producers for their products is extended to include the social costs of waste management, including {{the environmental impact of}} waste disposal. This paper sets out a framework for assessing {{the costs and benefits of}} EPR. As compared with “conventional” waste management EPR involves the collection of particular end-of-life products, product categories or waste streams. In some cases these wastes would traditionally be handled appropriately through municipal waste management programs. Packaging would be one example. In other cases they might be handled, or might need to be handled, as <b>special</b> <b>wastes</b> which would be inappropriate for a municipal waste management programme. Solvents, scrap tires, used crankcase oil, lead acid batteries and electronics fit into this category. To evaluate the costs and benefit ratio for EPR programmes, the costs of these features need to be weighed against the benefits in terms of the reduced social costs of waste management, including the various externalities associated with landfilling or incineration and the environmental risks associated with “doing nothing” by maintaining existing practices. ...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{a deserted}} clay quarry to collect iron manufacturing-derived <b>special</b> <b>wastes</b> has been {{carefully}} assessed {{with a view to}} protecting ground water resources. The shallower ground water is of low quantity and poor quality. It is encompassed by a calcarenite aquifer, the bottom of which consists of clays. A limited calcarenite layer is found below, transgressively lying over the main Apulian carbonate shelf. The aquifer carbonate rocks enclose large ground water resources which ultimately flows into the Ionian Sea. A plastic waterproof diaphragm inert to percolation products has been installed to protect ground water against pollution hazards resulting from the disposal of industrial wastes. The dump is actually located in the vicinity of major industrial plants, the basements of which corresponds to the shallow aquifer. Both the basements and the railway cuttings greatly affect the ground water flow. Hydrogeological applied numerical calculation techniques have been used to evaluate the impact of a drainage trench on the ground water flow together with any noticeable influence of the latter on construction works and industrial plants in place...|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{information}} is a structural part of the decision making process. The role of the information gathering process {{can best be described}} as Hayes' process to improve preposterior distributions in probability assignments that will serve as basis for decision making processes. Hydrogeologic information is characterized by a low degree of predictability and high variability. The general cost structure of the hydrologic information gathering process is represented in information cost curves which are combined with production cost or opportunity loss curves to give total cost curves. These may display a minimum which is the point of diminishing returns at which exploration activities should be ceased. One of the main unsolved problems is the proper definition of a universally applicable unit of information content.

40|$|The {{production}} and storage of uranium mine mill tailings {{have the potential}} to contaminate local groundwater and surface waters with metals and metalloids. As such, an understanding of the solids reservoirs for potential contaminants in uranium ore blends and leach residues (solid wastes generated by the milling of ore) is required to predict long-term controls on these contaminants in tailings porewaters. This study characterized the distribution of the elements of concern (EOCs; As, Mo, Ni, and Se) in uranium ores and waste rock used to blend the mill feeds in the milling process and leach residues from the Key Lake mining operation, Saskatchewan. This study also evaluated the alteration of the clay minerals in these uranium ores, waste rocks and leach residues. X-ray diffraction, electron micro-probe, and mineral liberation analyses showed that the reservoirs for As, Mo, Ni, and Se (in ores and ore blends) were dominated by sulphides including cobaltite, gersdorffite, molybdenite, pyrite, galena and chalcopyrite, secondary Ni-arsenates (annabergite?), Fe-arsenate (scorodite?) and Ni-Co/Ni-sulfates. The secondary arsenates and sulfates present in <b>special</b> <b>waste</b> were identified as major As, Mo, Ni, and Se bearing minerals and most likely the product of oxidation of arsenide-bearing sulphide minerals within the <b>special</b> <b>waste</b> rock.

The percentages of unleached minerals varied between mill feeds and were dependent on the grain-size distribution and the degree of mineral liberation.
