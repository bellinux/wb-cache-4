The system is tested on two mechanical larynx replicas. The first one consists of two rigid half cylinders in forced oscillation controlled by a step motor. The second one is flow driven and uses latex tubes filled with water in order to reproduce vocal folds self-oscillation. Time-varying glottal area is measured accurately for both replicas.

The algorithm extends the common self-organizing map (SOM) from the processing of purely spatial signals to the processing of spatiotemporal signals. The main additional idea of the TOM compared with the SOM is the functionally reasonable transfer of temporal <b>signal</b> <b>distances</b> into spatial <b>signal</b> <b>distances</b> in topographic neural representa-tions.

In [...] "Novel kernel based recognizers of human actions," [...] Danafar et al. study unsupervised and supervised recognition of human actions in video sequences. The videos are represented by probability distributions and then meaningfully compared in a probabilistic framework. They introduce two novel approaches, which outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms when tested on the KTH and Weizmann public datasets: one is an unsupervised non-parametric kernel-based method that exploits the Maximum Mean Discrepancy test statistic {{and the other is}} a supervised method based on a support vector machine (SVM) with a characteristic kernel specifically tailored to histogram-based information. The paper by Yu et al., entitled [...] "Efficient Human Action and Gait Analysis Using Multiresolution Motion Energy Histogram," [...] effectively adopts the average motion energy (AME) image to describe human motions by proposing a histogram based approach to improve the computation efficiency. In the paper, the human action/gait recognition problem is formulated as a histogram matching problem, and a quadtree decomposition-based multiresolution structure on the motion energy histogram (MEH) is used to speed up the calculation. Two applications, action recognition and gait classification, are conducted in the experiments to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed approach. In the paper, [...] "Recognizing human actions using NWFE-based histogram vectors," [...] Lin et al. presented a novel system for human action recognition. Two research issues are addressed in this paper, namely, motion representation and subspace learning. The proposed system first extracts a combined feature, which integrates the <b>signal</b> <b>distance</b> feature and the width feature extracted from a human pose silhouette. Principle component analysis (PCA) is then employed to reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors and the k-means algorithm is also applied to construct a codebook.

40|$|AbstractDigital PCR in {{droplets}} (ddPCR) is {{an emerging}} method {{for more and}} more applications in DNA (and RNA) analysis. Special requirements when establishing ddPCR for analysis of genetically modified organisms (GMO) in a laboratory include the choice between validated official qPCR methods and the optimization of these assays for a ddPCR format. Differentiation between droplets with positive reaction and negative droplets, that is setting of an appropriate threshold, can be crucial for a correct measurement. This holds true in particular when independent transgene and plant-specific reference gene copy numbers have to be combined to determine the content of GM material in a sample. Droplets which show fluorescent units ranging between those of explicit positive and negative droplets are called ‘rain’. Signals of such droplets can hinder analysis and the correct setting of a threshold. In this manuscript, a computer-based algorithm has been carefully designed to evaluate assay performance and facilitate objective criteria for assay optimization. Optimized assays in return minimize the impact of rain on ddPCR analysis. We developed an Excel based ‘experience matrix’ that reflects the assay parameters of GMO ddPCR tests performed in our laboratory. Parameters considered include singleplex/duplex ddPCR, assay volume, thermal cycler, probe manufacturer, oligonucleotide concentration, annealing/elongation temperature, and a droplet separation evaluation. We additionally propose an objective droplet separation value which is based on both absolute fluorescence <b>signal</b> <b>distance</b> of positive and negative droplet populations and the variation within these droplet populations. The proposed performance classification in the experience matrix can be used for a rating of different assays for the same GMO target, thus enabling employment of the best suited assay parameters. Main optimization parameters include annealing/extension temperature and oligonucleotide concentrations. The droplet separation value allows for easy and reproducible assay performance evaluation. The combination of separation value with the experience matrix simplifies the choice of adequate assay parameters for a given GMO event...|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{we develop}} an anchor-less {{relative}} localisation algorithm aimed {{to be used}} in multi-robot teams. The localisation is performed based on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) readings collected from the messages exchanged between nodes. We use the RSSI as a rough estimate of the inverse of distance between any pair of communicating nodes, and we claim that such estimates provide a coarse information of the nodes relative localisation that is still suitable to support several coordination tasks. In addition, we introduce a relative velocity estimation framework based on the RSSI measurements. This framework uses consecutive distance measurements and position estimates to provide the relative velocity vectors for all the nodes in the network. To accomplish this, we propose using a Kalman filter and the Floyd–Warshall algorithm to generate smooth RSSI pairwise <b>signal</b> <b>distance</b> for all nodes. Then we use Multidimensional Scaling to obtain relative positions from the pairwise distances. Finally, due to anchor unavailability, relative positions are adjusted to reflect the continuous mobility by using geometric transformations, thus obtaining smoother trajectories for mobile nodes. This allows us to estimate velocity and to establish a correspondence between orientation in the physical world and in the relative coordinates system. Additionally, we study the impact of several parameters in calculating the network topology, namely different approaches to provide a symmetric distances matrix, the period of the matrix dissemination, the use of synchronisation of the transmissions, and the filtering of the RSSI data. Experimental results, with a set of MicaZ motes, show that the period of matrix dissemination is the most relevant of the parameters, specifically with larger periods providing the best results, however, shorter periods are shown to be possible as long as the transmissions are synchronised...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years Tip-Enhanced Raman {{spectroscopy}} (TERS) has been developed into a versatile analytical tool for the detection and identification of (sub) monolayer adsorbates at single crystalline metal surfaces [1, 2]. The illumination of a gold STM tip in close vicinity, i. e. in tunneling contact, to a sample surface generates a strongly enhanced electromagnetic field at the tip apex. However, the size of this enhanced field in relation to the tip curvature is still under debate. One approach towards the determination of the nearfield dimension is the measurement of the tip-sample distance dependence of the TER signal. This is achieved by applying an external voltage to the z-piezo which controls the tip movement in z-direction perpendicularly to the sample surface. After switching off the feed-back loop of the STM, the z-scan of the tip is controlled by a programmable ramp generator, which can be set to different speeds. During the retraction of the STM tip, a series of Raman spectra is taken subsequently at intervals of approximately 1. 5 seconds. Our experimental results – we monitor the A 1 breathing mode of ClO 4 - at Au(111) – show a fast decay of the TER signal within 10 to 15 nm tip-sample distance for smooth tips of about 20 - 30 nm radius. These findings are in agreement with a simple theoretical model [3] which assigns an R- 10 nearfield distance dependence to the TER profile of a 2 -dimensional object, i. e. the adsorbate layer. According to the model, we expect different slopes for the <b>signal</b> <b>distance</b> curves for varying tip radii, e. g. for larger tip curvatures we expect a slower decay of the signal intensity with increasing tip-sample distance. As a first estimate, we find that the radius of the enhanced field is about half the radius of the tip apex. [1] B. Pettinger, B. Ren, G. Picardi, R. Schuster, G. Ertl, Phys. Rev.
