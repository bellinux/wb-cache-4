40|$|Introduction: The <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> is {{the most}} common method used for the {{detection}} and control of bovine tuberculosis (TB). Specificity and sensitivity of this <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> is low, so it is better to perform another test in parallel for investigation of the disease. The ELISA test is user friendly, so it can be an appropriate test for performing in parallel with the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> for an accurate detection. The aim of this study is the development of an ELISA test (kit) based on proteins smaller than 10 kDa (specially ESAT- 6) for the detection of TB in cattle. Materials and Methods: Proteins lower than 10 kDa M. W. were isolated from sonicated bacteria and were precipitated with ammonium sulfate. Protein assay was done after dialysis. Then a checkerboard was done for the determination of the best concentration of antigens and antibodies. There were 114 serum samples that were isolated; 100 cows that three continual <b>tuberculin</b> <b>tests</b> were negative and 14 serum samples were positive (in the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test).</b> Culture and PCR were done from lymph nodes (or tissues) of tuberculin positive cows. Stability was investigated on days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 in 37 °C. Results: The best concentration of antigens and antibodies were acquired 200 ng and 1 / 100 respectively. All of the 100 samples that were negative in the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>tests</b> were negative in this ELISA kit as well, but out of 14 samples that were positive in the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test,</b> just 8 samples were positive in the ELISA kit. Meanwhile, the results of culture and PCR were compatible with the ELISA kit's results. There was a variation of less than 10 % between days 0 and 7 at 37 °C that shows at least 1 year stability of this kit in refrigerator temperatures (4 – 8 °C). Conclusion: Performing the ELISA test based on ESAT- 6 antigen shows that this test can be a suitable way for screening beside the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> for accurate detection. It is noticed that the specificity of the ELISA test was determined more than the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test,</b> especially since the culture and PCR are gold standards. Therefore, incorrect sampling can change the specificity of the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test.</b> The results of this kit can encourage designing of an ELISA kit for the detection of human TB...|$|R

40|$|Background. Repeat <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>tests</b> may {{be false}} {{positive}} due to boosting of waned immunity to past mycobacterial exposure. We evaluated whether an ELISPOT test could identify tuberculosis (TB) contacts with boosting of immunity to nontuberculous mycobacterial exposure. Methodology/Principal Findings. We conducted <b>tuberculin</b> and ELISPOT <b>tests</b> in 1665 TB contacts: 799 were <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> negative and were offered a repeat test after three months. Those with <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> conversion had an ELISPOT, chest X-ray and sputum analysis if appropriate. We compared converters with non-converters, assessed {{the probability of}} each of four combinations of ELISPOT results over the two time points and estimated boosting with adjustment for ELISPOT sensitivity and specificity. 704 (72 %) contacts had a repeat tuberculin test; 176 (25 %) had test conversion, which increased with exposure to a case (p = 0. 002), increasing age (p = 0. 0006) and BCG scar (p = 0. 06). 114 <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> converters had ELISPOT results: 16 (14 %) were recruitment positive/follow-up positive, 9 (8 %) positive/negative, 34 (30 %) negative/positive, and 55 (48 %) were negative/negative.

40|$|Rationale: Diagnosis of latent {{tuberculosis}} infection (LTBI) is currently {{based on the}} <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test.</b> The enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) is a new blood test to diagnose LTBI. Objective: To compare the ELISPOT and the <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test</b> for detecting LTBI in contacts of patients with tuberculosis. Methods: Prospective study of 413 contacts of patients with tuberculosis. Measurements and Main Results: Because there is no gold standard for LTBI, the sensitivity and specificity of the ELISPOT and <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test</b> cannot be directly measured. For each contact, we therefore estimated the likelihood of having LTBI by calculating a contact score that quantified exposure to and infectiousness of the index case. We analyzed the relationship of contact score to ELISPOT and <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test</b> results. The likelihood of a positive ELISPOT (p = 0. 0005) and a <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test</b> (p = 0. 01) increased significantly with rising contact scores. The contact score was more strongly related to the ELISPOT than to the <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test</b> results, although this difference was not statistically significant. Among U. S. -born persons {{and those who were}} not vaccinated with bacille Calmette-Guérin, approximately 30 % had positive ELISPOT or <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test</b> results. Foreign-born, bacille Calmette-Guérin–vaccinated persons {{were significantly more likely to}} have a positive <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test</b> than a positive ELISPOT result (p < 0. 0001). Conclusions: Compared with the <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test,</b> the ELISPOT appears to be at least as sensitive for diagnosis of LTBI in contacts of patients with tuberculosis...|$|R
40|$|Background: The <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> {{is widely}} used to {{identify}} tuberculosisinfection. Some individuals infected with Mycobacteriumtuberculosis may have an initial negative skin <b>test</b> reactionto <b>tuberculin.</b> The two step purified protein derivative skin testcan decrease misinterpretation of <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test.</b> This study wasaimed at comparing the two- step <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test</b> and boosterphenomenon in health care workers and non hospital employees. Methods: One hundred and eighty five health service employeesfrom Razi University Hospital and 181 non hospitalemployees were subjected to an initial <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test.</b> Those who were negative on the first test underwent a secondone 2 weeks later. The reactions to the tests were measured 72 hours later. Tests with an induration of ≥ 10 mm was consideredpositive. Moreover, second tests with an induration of atleast 6 mm increase relative to the relevant first tests wereconsidered positive. Results: Compared to non hospital employees (n= 79, 43. 6 %), asignificantly higher number of health care workers (n= 113, 61. 1 %) were positive on the first <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test.</b> 18. 5 % of healthcare workers and 31. 5 % of non hospital employees demonstrateda boosted reaction after the second <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test.</b> The occurrenceof boosted reaction {{was significantly associated with}} ageboth groups. There was no association between the presence ofBCG scars and the occurrence of boosted reaction. Conclusion: the present study shows that the prevalence of TBwas higher among health care worker than non hospital employees. Moreover, it demonstrated that non hospital employeeshad a higher age-associated booster reaction to the second tuberculinskin test than health care workers. Therefore, to avoidmissing false negative cases, it would be necessary to do a secondtuberculin test for subjects with a negative reaction to theinitial test, especially in subjects older than 40 years...|$|R
40|$|The herd {{incidence}} of confirmed Mycobacterium bovis infection in cattle in the south-west of England has been approximately ten {{times that of}} the remainder of England and Wales; this greater incidence has been attributed to infection from badgers. The incidence of herds with only non-visible lesioned <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> reactors, from which M. bovis was not isolated, has also remained higher in the south-west region. The incidences of these latter unconfirmed incidents were compared in parishes in the south-west region in which M. bovis in cattle had been confirmed, and those where M. bovis had not been confirmed, for the period 1979 - 83. This analysis was carried out both for those parishes in which herds had been subjected to annual <b>tuberculin</b> <b>testing</b> and for those subjected to biennial <b>tuberculin</b> <b>testing.</b> The incidence of unconfirmed incidents was significantly higher in parishes in which confirmed incidents had occurred, and this difference was found in both the annual and biennially tested parishes. The relative risks for the incidence of unconfirmed incidents in annually and biennially tested parishes were 1. 89 and 2. 56, respectively. The incidence of unconfirmed incidents in biennially tested parishes was lower than in annually tested parishes. The incidence of non-specific <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> reactor herds was estimated from <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> results in the eastern region of England during a period when tuberculosis was not confirmed in cattle. A comparison of this incidence and that of unconfirmed incidents in the south-west region suggests that approximately 70 % of the unconfirmed incidents in the south-west were related to exposure to M. bovis. The results of the analyses indicate that unconfirmed incidents cannot be completely ignored in epidemiological analyses and studies of bovine tuberculosis in the problem areas of the south-west region of England...|$|R
