For example, when a central authority nationalizes one language, that attaches economic and <b>social</b> <b>advantages</b> to the prestige language. As generations pass, use of the indigenous language often fades or disappears, and linguistic and cultural identity recede as well. However, some groups are seeking to revive their indigenous identities. One important political aspect of this pursuit is petitioning the government for official recognition as a separate and distinct ethnic group.|$|E

However, the predictive validity of the SAT has been shown to depend on the dominant ethnic and racial composition of the college. Some studies have also shown that African American students under-perform in college relative to their white peers with the same SAT scores; researchers have argued that this is likely because white students tend to benefit from <b>social</b> <b>advantages</b> outside of the educational environment (for example, high parental involvement in their education, inclusion in campus academic activities, positive bias from same-race teachers and peers) which result in better grades.|$|E

500|$|Larissis v. Greece (1999) {{points to}} other grounds {{on which the}} right to {{propagate}} one's religion might reasonably be restricted in Singapore. In that case, the European Court of Human Rights accepted {{that the right to}} try to persuade another of one's own religious beliefs is included in the [...] "right to manifest [...] religion or belief" [...] provided for by Article 9(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights. However, this right is not void of limitations. Article 9(2) of the Convention prescribes limitations to the freedom to manifest one's religion [...] "in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or {{for the protection of the}} rights and freedoms of others". The Court clarified that Article 9(1) does not protect improper proselytism, such as when one offers material or <b>social</b> <b>advantages</b> to entice another to adopt certain religious beliefs, or when one applies improper pressure with a view to gaining new members for a religious group. On the facts of the case, the Court found that Article 9 had not been infringed by the prosecution of three air force officers for proselytizing to their subordinates, since the hierarchical nature of military life meant it was difficult for a subordinate to rebuff the approaches of persons of superior rank. Thus, a conversation which might be regarded as a harmless exchange of ideas in a civilian context could be seen in a military setting as harassment or the imposition of undue pressure in abuse of power.|$|E

2500|$|The {{novel was}} a {{critical}} success, receiving praise from respected individuals, including the statesman Edmund Burke and literary critic Dr Johnson. It was admired for its comic view of wealthy English society, and for its realistic portrayal of working-class London dialects, and is known today as a satire [...] It was even discussed by some characters in another epistolary novel of the period: Elizabeth Blower's The Parsonage House (1780). Burney's father read public reviews of the novel before learning that the author was his own daughter. Although the act of publication was radical for a woman {{at that time and}} of her age, he was impressed by the favourable reactions to the book and largely supported her.

50|$|The {{sixth and}} final chapter of Deborah Brandt’s Literacy in American Lives {{discusses}} they {{ways in which}} literacy causes economic stratification of the American population. According to Brandt, “Where once literate skill would merely have confirmed <b>social</b> <b>advantage,</b> it is, under current economic conditions, a growing resource in <b>social</b> <b>advantage</b> itself.” Schools themselves seem to propagate the problem because the schools that produce the most literate and highest achieving individuals receive the most government funding. Conversely, schools that are struggling to produce literate and high achieving individuals receive the least funding and thus, the cycle repeats with the pattern becoming more exacerbated each time. This is also intimately associated with a child’s family background. For example, Brandt writes, “Children from families with poor earnings or poor understanding of school culture are more poorly prepared, and that explains their relative underachievement school.” This has raised many concerns as to whether children from low socioeconomic backgrounds should receive earlier and additional educational interventions to help them overcome the inherent obstacles they face in their journeys towards literacy acquisition.|$|R

60|$|All {{this will}} serve {{to explain the}} terms on which Mrs Dale was living at the Small House,--a matter needful of {{explanation}} sooner or later. Her husband had been the youngest of three brothers, and in many respects the brightest. Early in life he had gone up to London, and there had done well as a land surveyor. He had done so well that Government had employed him, and for some {{three or four years}} he had enjoyed a large income, but death had come suddenly on him, while he was only yet ascending the ladder; and, when he died, he had hardly begun to realise the golden prospects which he had seen before him. This had happened some fifteen years before our story commenced, so that the two girls hardly retained any memory of their father. For {{the first five years of}} her widowhood, Mrs Dale, who had never been a favourite of the squire's, lived with her two little girls in such modest way as her very limited means allowed. Old Mrs Dale, the squire's mother, then occupied the Small House. But when old Mrs Dale died, the squire offered the place rent-free to his sister-in-law, intimating to her that her daughters would obtain considerable <b>social</b> <b>advantages</b> by living at Allington. She had accepted the offer, and the <b>social</b> <b>advantages</b> had certainly followed. Mrs Dale was poor, her whole income not exceeding three hundred a year, and therefore her own style of living was of necessity very unassuming; but she saw her girls becoming popular in the county, much liked by the families around them, and enjoying nearly all the advantages which would have accrued to them had they been the daughters of Squire Dale of Allington. Under such circumstances it was little to her whether or no she were loved by her brother-in-law, or respected by Hopkins. Her own girls loved her, and respected her, and that was pretty much all that she demanded of the world on her own behalf.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Special {{studies and}} {{isolated}} initiatives {{over the past}} several decades in low-, middle- and high-income countries have consistently shown inequalities in health among socioeconomic groups and by gender, race or ethnicity, geographical area and other measures associated with <b>social</b> <b>advantage.</b> Significant health inequalities linked to <b>social</b> (dis) <b>advantage</b> rather than to inherent biological differences are generally considered unfair or inequitable. Such health inequities are the main object of health development efforts, including global targets such as the Millennium Development Goals, which require monitoring to evaluate progress. However, most national health information systems (HIS) lack key information needed to assess and address health inequities, namely, reliable, longitudinal and representative data linking measures of health with measures of <b>social</b> status or <b>advantage</b> at the individual or small-area level. Without empirical documentation and monitoring of such inequities, as well as country-level capacity to use this information for effective planning and monitoring of progress in response to interventions, movement towards equity is unlikely to occur. This paper reviews core information requirements and potential databases and proposes short-term and longer term strategies for strengthening the capabilities of HIS for the analysis of health equity and discusses HIS-related entry points for supporting a cultur...|$|R
