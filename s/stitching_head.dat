50|$|Based on {{embroidery}} machinery used in {{the garment}} textile industry, the machines have been adapted to deposit and stitch fiber roving material onto a base material. Roving material, mostly common carbon fibers, from about 3.000 up to 50.000 filaments can be applied. The preform is produced continuously by the placement of a single roving. The roving material pulled of a spool is guided by a pipe which is positioned {{in front of the}} stitching needle. The roving pipe and the frame, where the base material is fixed onto, move synchronized stepwise to perform a zigzag stitch relative to needle position. The <b>stitching</b> <b>head</b> equipped with roving spool, pipe and needle can rotate arbitrarily 360 degrees. During each stitch the upper thread is pulled through the base material and looped around the lower thread spool. Hence a double backstitch is performed. Currently, up to 800 stitches per minute can be achieved. The base material can be a 2D-textile such as woven or non-woven fabric or a matrix-compatible foil material for thermoplastic composites. The stitching path can be designed in form of a pattern either with the help of classical design embroidery software or more recent by use of 2D-CAD systems. Afterwards necessary information of the stitch positions are added to the pattern with the help of so-called punch software and finally transferred to the TFP machine.|$|E

40|$|A {{computer}} system automatically generates CNC code for a stitching machine. The computer determines {{the locations of}} a present stitching point and a next stitching point. If a constraint is not found between the present stitching point and the next stitching point, the computer generates code for making a stitch at the next stitching point. If a constraint is found, the computer generates code for changing a condition (e. g., direction) of the stitching machine's <b>stitching</b> <b>head...</b>|$|E

The amount of damage to the unit frequency Stitching machines because companies do not yet have a scheduled maintenance activity for each component so that the machine crashes arrived - arrived when operating. To overcome these problems required maintenance interval planning for critical components of the engine unit Stitching. From the analysis of the critical components discovered two critical components of the most influential, namely components <b>Stitching</b> <b>Head</b> and Stang. From the calculation Time to Failure (TTF) and Time to Repair (TTR) of critical components used for distribution menentuan damage and parameter values to calculate the value of MTTF and MTTR. Interval treatment for critical components <b>Stitching</b> <b>Head</b> is 23 days, while for critical components Stang is 72 days. The calculation of the cost of care of two critical components can save costs amounting to $ 1. 310, 08 from the previous year and an increase of productivity of 6, 77 tonne...|$|E
40|$|A {{stitching}} system {{includes a}} gantry that is movable along a material support table. Mounted to the gantry are {{a plurality of}} stitching heads and bobbins. The stitching heads are individually controllable in a z-direction, and the bobbins are individually controllable in the z-direction. Each <b>stitching</b> <b>head</b> is paired with a bobbin. Each pair of stitching heads and the bobbins is controlled synchronously in the z-direction. The stitching system is well-suited for stitching preforms of aircraft wing covers and other preforms having variable thickness and compound, contoured three-dimensional surfaces...|$|E
