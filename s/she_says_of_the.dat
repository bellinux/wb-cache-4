A autora se coloca frente ao dilema de seu próprio desejo, incontrolável como ela mesma diz, de antever um futuro pleno de sociólogos críticos e atentos às contradições mais fundamentais da contemporaneidade e o realismo da diversidade que inclui o afastamento da perspectiva da maioria trabalhadora e o conseqüente adesismo de oportunidade aos grupos hegemônicos. &# 13; &# 13; Palavras-chave: Intelectuais.

50|$|After it was {{discovered}} that Jerry Seinfeld once dated writer and comedian Carol Leifer, speculation grew that Elaine was based on Leifer, though that was later largely denied.

According to Seinfeld's biography (written by Jerry Oppenheimer), Elaine was based in part on Susan McNabb (who was dating Seinfeld when the character was created), though eventually named after friend and fellow comic Elayne Boosler. Also, the character was partially based on Monica Yates, daughter of novelist Richard Yates, whom Larry David once dated, and they remained good friends after they broke up.|$|R

50|$|Her {{experiences}} as a widow {{as well as a}} researcher finds expression in her novel The Blue Necked Braja (1976), which is about <b>the</b> plight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Radhaswamis <b>of</b> Vrindavan who lived in abject poverty and sexual exploitation in everyday life. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main issues that the novel touches upon is <b>the</b> plight <b>of</b> young widows for whom companionship beyond <b>the</b> confines <b>of</b> their ashrams and fellow widows become impossible. Their urge to live, as well as the moral dilemma that they face vis-a-vis <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> precepts of religion in this regard, are brought out with astonishing clarity and feeling in the novel. The novel exposed <b>the</b> uglier face <b>of</b> Vrindavan - <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Krishna, an Hindu deity - inviting criticism of Goswami from conservative sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> society. It remains a classic in modern Indian Literature. It is autobiographical in character as <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> anguish <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main character Saudamini, reflects what she had gone through after her husband had died. It was also the first novel to be written on this subject.

2500|$|This sonnet is {{important}} because it is the first one that Shakespeare gives us. It sets the tone for <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collection <b>of</b> sonnets. According to Helen Vendler, this sonnet can be “as an index to <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sonnets". The main reason <b>she</b> <b>says</b> that it {{is important}} is because it brings [...] "into play such a plethora of conceptual material; it seems a self-conscious groundwork laid for the rest". Scholars like Helen Vendler think that this particular sonnet may have been composed after the others. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> that because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "sheer abundance of values, images, and concepts important in the sequence which are called into play" [...] and [...] "the number of significant words brought to our attention" [...] in this sonnet, that it [...] "may have been deliberately composed late, as a 'preface' to the others". Philip Martin says that Sonnet 1 is important to the rest because it [...] "states the themes for the sonnets immediately following and also for the sequence at large". To him, the themes are announced in this sonnet and the later ones develop those themes. Joseph Pequigney says that Sonnet 1 does serve an introductory and does it unconventionally; [...] "it might on that very account be seen as a befitting way to begin <b>the</b> least conventional <b>of</b> Renaissance love-sonnet sequences". It provides a [...] "production of metaphorical motifs that will recur in the upcoming sonnets, particularly in the next fourteen or so; it gives <b>the</b> concepts <b>of</b> beauty and time and their interrelationship, as also <b>the</b> emblem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rose, all <b>of</b> which carry <b>the</b> weight in the other sonnets; and it shows <b>the</b> theme <b>of</b> reproduction, to be taken up in all except one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sixteen ensuing poems".|$|R
