30|$|Other {{possible}} contributing {{processes are}} electrokinetic effects (Revil et al. 2003) and piezomagnetic effects (Sasai 1991 b). Electrokinetic <b>effects</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> gas and fluid flow. They {{should have been}} observed as short-term noise in the repeated SP surveys regularly made on the northern flank before the crisis. This {{was not the case}} (Zlotnicki et al. 2017). The significant magnetic fields changes we observe are progressive long-term variations. A third possible process concerns piezomagnetic <b>effects</b> <b>resulting</b> <b>from</b> stress changes on the magnetization of rocks within the volcano during intrusions. Therefore, we first investigate the piezomagnetic signals in relation with the long-term TMF signals.|$|R

Following Yoon and Starks (1995) we use short- and long-run abnormal forecast revisions to measure both effects, analyzing them as a function of firm-specific characteristics. We find that firm type, loss estimates, reinsurance use, and tax position are important determinants of the short-run position. Firm type, loss estimates, financial strength, underwriting risk, and reinsurance are key determinants of the firm's long-run position. Copyright The Journal of Risk and Insurance, 2008. ...|$|R
