50|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, {{the five}} German <b>snipers</b> at Fürstenfeldbruck {{did not have}} radio contact with one another (nor with the German authorities conducting the rescue operation) and therefore were unable to coordinate their fire. The only contact the <b>snipers</b> had with the operational leadership was with Georg Wolf, who was lying next to the three <b>snipers</b> on the control tower giving orders directly to them. The two <b>snipers</b> at ground level had been given vague instructions to shoot when the other <b>snipers</b> began shooting, and were basically left to fend for themselves.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Army's lack of {{familiarity}} with sniping tactics proved disastrous in Normandy and the campaign in Western Europe where they encountered well trained German <b>snipers.</b> In Normandy, German <b>snipers</b> remained hidden in the dense vegetation {{and were able to}} encircle American units, firing at them from all sides. The American and British forces were surprised by how near the German <b>snipers</b> could approach in safety and attack them, as well as by their ability to hit targets at up to 1,000m. A notable mistake made by inexperienced American soldiers was to lie down and wait when targeted by German <b>snipers,</b> allowing the <b>snipers</b> to pick them off one after another. German <b>snipers</b> often infiltrated Allied lines and sometimes when the front-lines moved, they continued to fight from their sniping positions, refusing to surrender until their rations and munitions were exhausted.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Sniper's</b> Badge (Scharfschützenabzeichen) was a World War II German {{military}} decoration {{awarded to}} <b>snipers.</b> It was instituted on 20 August 1944. Initially, {{it was only}} eligible to personnel serving in the German Army and the Waffen-SS. Later, by order of the High Command, it was also made available to <b>snipers</b> of the other armed services.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Snipers</b> of the Soviet Union {{played an}} {{important}} role mainly on the Eastern Front of World War II, apart from other preceding and subsequent conflicts. In World War II, Soviet <b>snipers</b> used the 7.62×54mmR rifle cartridge with light, heavy, armour-piercing (B-30), armour-piercing-incendiary (B-32), zeroing-and-incendiary (P3), and tracer bullets. Most Soviet World War II <b>snipers</b> carried a combat load of 120 rifle cartridges in the field. Unlike the militaries of other nations, these <b>snipers</b> could be men or women. In 1943, there were over 2,000 women functioning in this role.|$|R
50|$|Often in {{situations}} with multiple targets, <b>snipers</b> use relocation. After firing {{a few shots}} from a certain position, <b>snipers</b> move unseen to another location before the enemy can determine {{where they are and}} mount a counter-attack. <b>Snipers</b> will frequently use this tactic to their advantage, creating an atmosphere of chaos and confusion. In other, rarer situations, relocation is used to eliminate the factor of wind.|$|R
5|$|As the IX Corps {{gave up on}} Triangle Hill, the PVA 31st Division of the 12th Corps was in {{position}} to take back <b>Sniper</b> Ridge. Under the cover of inclement weather, an assault was launched by the 92nd Regiment at 4pm on November 11. The Chinese soon drove off the defending 1st Battalion of the ROK 32nd Regiment, but Chung Il-kwon immediately replied with a counterattack by the ROK 17th Regiment of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division on the dawn of November 12. After two hours of fighting, the 1st Battalion of the ROK 17th Regiment recaptured two-thirds of <b>Sniper</b> Ridge and inflicted heavy casualties on the PVA 92nd Regiment. The 31st Division relieved the 92nd Regiment with its 93rd Regiment to launch another assault on November 14, but the ROK 17th Regiment responded by committing all units to blunt the attack. By November 17, {{with the help of}} the ROK 1st Field Artillery Group, the ROK 2nd Battalion returned to the 1st Battalion's original position after a two-hour battle. Undeterred by heavy casualties, the PVA 106th Regiment of the 34th Division, 12th Corps relieved the weakened 93rd Regiment during the night of November18. For the next six days, 'seesaw' fighting continued on <b>Sniper</b> Ridge. By November 25, the ROK 2nd Infantry Division was relieved by the ROK 9th Infantry Division on <b>Sniper</b> Ridge and the fighting finally died down.|$|E

5|$|Hitman: <b>Sniper</b> is a 2015 mobile {{shooting}} gallery video {{game in the}} Hitman series by Square Enix Montreal. As the series' mainstay protagonist Agent 47, the player looks through a first-person <b>sniper</b> scope vision on their touchscreen device to assassinate several powerful figures who have assembled at a lakeside compound without alerting their associates. The player uses the environment to find creative ways to kill these targets, sometimes prompted by secondary objectives. Through mission progression, the player unlocks more powerful weapons and new weapon abilities.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{captured}} <b>snipers</b> {{are often}} summarily executed. This happened during World War I, and World War II, {{for example the}} second Biscari Massacre when 36 suspected <b>snipers</b> were lined up and shot on 14 July 1943.|$|R
5000|$|In 1932, the [...] "sharpshooters' movement" [...] started {{under the}} {{supervision}} of the Kliment Voroshilov. In 1938, Red Army <b>snipers</b> took part in the Battle of Lake Khasan against troops of the Imperial Japanese Army. The most successful Soviet use of <b>snipers</b> during the second world war was during their defensive stages (1941-1943), after which the advantage of defense shifted to the German side and German <b>snipers</b> became a real danger to the advancing Soviets.|$|R
50|$|It {{was known}} a half-hour before the hostages and kidnappers had even arrived at Fürstenfeldbruck {{that the number}} of the latter was larger than first believed. Despite this new information, Schreiber decided to {{continue}} with the rescue operation as originally planned and the new information could not reach the <b>snipers</b> since they had no radios. It is a basic tenet of sniping operations that there are enough <b>snipers</b> (at least two for each known target, or in this case a minimum of ten) deployed to neutralize as many of the attackers as possible with the first volley of shots.The 2006 National Geographic Channel's Seconds From Disaster profile on the massacre stated that the helicopters were supposed to land sideways and {{to the west of the}} control tower, a maneuver which would have allowed the <b>snipers</b> clear shots into them as the kidnappers threw open the helicopter doors. Instead, the helicopters were landed facing the control tower and at the centre of the airstrip. This not only gave them a place to hide after the gunfight began, but put <b>Snipers</b> 1 and 2 in the line of fire of the other three <b>snipers</b> on the control tower. The <b>snipers</b> were denied valuable shooting opportunities as a result of the positioning of the helicopters, stacking the odds against what were effectively three <b>snipers</b> versus eight heavily armed gunmen.|$|R
5|$|In Metal Gear Solid, <b>Sniper</b> Wolf is {{a member}} of FOXHOUND and an elite <b>sniper</b> capable of going without food and staying still for up to a week.

5|$|For {{her actions}} {{in the battle for}} the village of Kozyi Gory (Smolensk Oblast), Shanina was awarded her first {{military}} decoration, the Order of Glory 3rd Class on 17 April 1944. She became the first Soviet female <b>sniper</b> and the first servicewoman of the 3rd Belorussian Front to receive that order. According to the report of Major Degtyarev (the commander of the 1138th Rifle Regiment), she received the award for the corresponding commendation list, between 6 and 11 April Shanina killed 13 enemy soldiers while subjected to artillery and machine gun fire. By May 1944, her <b>sniper</b> tally increased to 17 confirmed enemy kills, and Shanina was praised as a precise and brave soldier. The same year, on 9 June, Shanina's portrait was featured {{on the front page of}} the Soviet newspaper Unichtozhim Vraga.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} plan for Operation Showdown called for simultaneous attacks on both Triangle Hill and <b>Sniper</b> Ridge. One battalion from the 31st Infantry Regiment of the US 7th Infantry Division would take Triangle Hill from Gimhwa-eup, while one battalion from the 32nd Regiment of the Republic of Korea (ROK) 2nd Infantry Division would attack <b>Sniper</b> Ridge along a parallel northbound route. UN planners expected the operation to last {{no more than}} five days with 200 casualties on the UN side, {{based on the assumption that}} maximum artillery and air support would be available. Before the plan could be carried out, however, the artillery and air assets for this operation were diverted to the fighting at White Horse. Upon reviewing the situation, Colonel Lloyd R. Moses, commander of the US 31st Infantry Regiment, doubled the American strength just before the offensive.|$|E
50|$|In addition, the <b>snipers</b> did {{not have}} the proper {{equipment}} for this hostage rescue operation. The Heckler & Koch G3 battle rifles used were considered by several experts to be inadequate for the distance at which the <b>snipers</b> were trying to shoot. The G3, the standard service rifle of the Bundeswehr at that time, had a 18 in barrel; at the distances the <b>snipers</b> were required to shoot, a 27 in barrel would have ensured far greater accuracy. None of the rifles were equipped with telescopic or infrared sights. Additionally, none of the <b>snipers</b> were equipped with a steel helmet or bullet-proof vest. No armored vehicles were at the scene at Fürstenfeldbruck, and were only called in after the gunfight was well underway.|$|R
