5|$|Due to its graphic content, {{there are}} several {{different}} versions of Cannibal Holocaust in circulation which are edited to varying degrees. In the UK, the film was originally released on VHS by Go Video in 1982 with approximately six minutes of cuts. These cuts were self-imposed by the distributor, possibly due to technical limitations of the tape. In 2001, the film was passed for release on DVD by the BBFC with 5 minutes and 44 <b>seconds</b> <b>of</b> cuts to remove scenes of animal cruelty and sexual violence; all but 15 <b>seconds</b> <b>of</b> these cuts were waived for a re-release in 2011. The latter release also includes a new edit sponsored by Deodato which reduces the violence toward animals.|$|E
