5|$|In 2009, Jones {{brought a}} claim for damages for {{professional}} negligence against Kaney, {{on the basis that}} the personal injury claim had had to be settled for considerably less than would have been the case had Kaney not signed a document that apparently did not reflect her views. Kaney applied to strike out the claim before filing a defence, on the basis that the claim could not possibly succeed given the binding authority of the Court of Appeal decision of Stanton v Callaghan in 1998 that expert witnesses could not be sued for negligence when preparing a joint <b>statement</b> <b>with</b> the opposing side's expert witness.|$|E
5|$|Lichtenstein and Loran sparred in the press, and art {{critics were}} {{intrigued}} by the viewpoints of the two. Loran's view was that Lichtenstein had plagiarized his work, {{and at one point}} filed suit. Lichtenstein felt that he was making a <b>statement</b> <b>with</b> his painting on the ridiculous attempt by Loran to explain Cézanne by diagram. The press frequently used the word transformation when crediting Lichtenstein's work, but Lichtenstein attempted not to accept the association of his work with that word.|$|E

5|$|Somerset {{had been}} granted {{first-class}} status {{in advance of the}} 1882 season. Their maiden season at the top level was described by Wisden as disastrous, but the publication qualified this <b>statement</b> <b>with</b> mild optimism for 1883. The county {{failed to live up to}} this optimism, and although there were a few wins, performances on the whole were poor. Twice between 1882 and 1884 Somerset's opponents scored over 500 runs in an innings against them, and against Lancashire in 1884 they fielded only ten players. Stephen Newton, who had captained the side since 1882, left the club at the end of the 1884 season, and thereafter played all his cricket in London.|$|E
5|$|The record-breaking {{performance}} {{brought him}} an invite from the Berlin IAAF Golden League meet, although organising group Euromeetings condemned the move. Revelations in Chambers' autobiography Race Against Me brought further controversy {{as the book}} had in-depth accounts of his past drug abuse and claimed drug use remained rife in athletics, estimating that half the American Olympic athletes in Beijing had used illegal substances. Chambers signed a <b>statement</b> <b>with</b> UK Sport, verifying that he believed the information to be true, which brought a close to the organisation's inquiries into his drug use. An IAAF investigation concluded that the book demanded no further action on their part. Olympic gold medallist and anti-drugs campaigner Ed Moses gave his support, saying that Chambers admissions provided a useful insight, but that athletes and administrators remained in denial about {{the high levels of}} doping in athletics.|$|E

25|$|Irony {{is one of}} Austen's most {{characteristic}} {{and most}} discussed literary techniques. She contrasts the plain meaning of a <b>statement</b> <b>with</b> the comic, undermining {{the meaning of the}} original to create ironic disjunctions. In her juvenile works, she relies upon satire, parody and irony based on incongruity. Her mature novels employ irony to foreground social hypocrisy.|$|E

25|$|At 4:58 pm, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley held a {{news conference}} to discuss the {{verdicts}} handed down for the four LAPD police officers. Incensed, his statement showed both anger toward the verdicts and made an appeal for calm. Assistant Los Angeles police chief Bob Vernon believed Bradley's opening remarks invited a riot, and were perhaps taken as a signal by some citizens to act in violence. Vernon backed this <b>statement</b> <b>with</b> the assertion that the number of police incidents rose in the hour after the mayor's press conference.|$|E
