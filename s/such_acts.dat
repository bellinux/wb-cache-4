5|$|As the 1960s {{came to a}} close, folk rock {{changed and}} evolved away from the jangly {{template}} pioneered by The Byrds, but, Unterberger argues, the band's influence could still {{be heard in the}} music of Fairport Convention. Since the 1960s, The Byrds' jangly, folk rock sound has continued to influence popular music up to the present day, with authors Chris Smith, Johnny Rogan, Mark Deming, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine all noting the band's influence on <b>such</b> <b>acts</b> as Big Star, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, R.E.M., The Long Ryders, The Smiths, The Bangles, The Stone Roses, Teenage Fanclub, and The La's.|$|E
5|$|Hadley has {{conducted}} research on animal rights extremism, {{concluding that the}} phenomenon is a complex one, and that {{a full understanding of}} individual extremists' intentions and targets are necessary to understand the ethical acceptability of extremist acts and whether <b>such</b> <b>acts</b> are appropriately classified as terrorism. He holds that while direct action should be tolerated in liberal democracies, this toleration should not extend to certain campaigning tactics used by extremists, such as threat-making.|$|E
5|$|Hermano Pule {{immediately}} sent {{a letter}} to Archbishop José Seguí in Manila rebuking the acts of the Tayabas friars, and accusing them of beatings and threatening the excommunication of cofradía members. He also challenged the friars' authority to do <b>such</b> <b>acts</b> because the aims of the cofradía were never against the Catholic faith. On January 29, 1841, Pule {{sent a letter}} to the Bishop of Nueva Cáceres restating that the cofradía was not against canon law. The letter was forwarded to the juez provisor of the bishopric, who then endorsed it to Fr. Antonio Mateo and Fr. Manuel Sancho, who rejected Pule's petition.|$|E

The tour also played festival dates, on one occasion with The Eurythmics headlining one night and Bowie headlining the next.|$|E
5|$|Constable Hanks {{reported}} {{the matter to}} his superiors and the case was given to Detective Inspector Frederick Abberline. Inspector Abberline went to the brothel on 6 July with a warrant to arrest Hammond and Newlove for violation of Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. The Act made all homosexual acts between men, as well as procurement or attempted procurement of <b>such</b> <b>acts,</b> punishable by up to two years' imprisonment with or without hard labour. He found the house locked and Hammond gone, but Abberline was able to apprehend Newlove at his mother's house in Camden Town. In the time between his statement to Hanks and his arrest, Newlove had gone to Cleveland Street and warned Hammond, who had consequently escaped to his brother's house in Gravesend.|$|E
5|$|Coronations {{are still}} {{observed}} in the United Kingdom, Tonga, and several Asian and African countries. In Europe, most monarchs {{are required to take}} a simple oath {{in the presence of the}} country's legislature. Besides a coronation, a monarch's accession may be marked in many ways: some nations may retain a religious dimension to their accession rituals while others have adopted simpler inauguration ceremonies, or even no ceremony at all. Some cultures use bathing or cleansing rites, the drinking of a sacred beverage, or other religious practices to achieve a comparable effect. <b>Such</b> <b>acts</b> symbolise the granting of divine favour to the monarch within the relevant spiritual-religious paradigm of the country.|$|E

5|$|Despite the ceasefire {{agreement}} {{signed on}} 22 September between the JNA and Croatia, which {{provided for the}} resumption of supplies to the JNA barracks, the authorities in Bjelovar refused to restore utilities, claiming that the agreement allowed for the supply of JNA officers and soldiers only, {{but there were also}} civilians sheltering in the barracks. On 27 September, the Croatian General Staff directed that the garrison be captured on 28–30 September. Tus, acting as the Chief of the General Staff, ordered the clandestine killing of extremists before they caused mass killing of civilians or great material damage. According to Tus, this order was based on an assessment that there were extremist JNA officers present in Bjelovar, intent on carrying out <b>such</b> <b>acts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rana Bahadur Shah's youth {{had been}} spent in pampered luxury. In 1794 Rana Bahadur came of age, {{and his first}} act was to re-constitute the government, with his uncle, Bahadur Shah, removed from all {{official}} position. In mid 1795, he became infatuated with a Maithili Brahman widow, Kantavati Jha, and married her on the oath of making their illegitimate half-caste son (as per the Hindu law of that time) the heir apparent, by excluding the legitimate heir from his previous marriage. By 1797, {{his relationship with his}} uncle, who was living a retired life, and who wanted to seek refuge in China on the pretext of meeting the new emperor, had deteriorated {{to the extent that he}} ordered his imprisonment on 19 February 1797 and his subsequent murder on 23 June 1797. <b>Such</b> <b>acts</b> earned Rana Bahadur notoriety both among courtiers and common people, especially among Brahmins.|$|E
5|$|Sexuality {{played an}} {{important}} role in Crowley's ideas about magick and his practice of it, and has been described as being central to Thelema. He outlined three forms of sex magick—the autoerotic, homosexual, and heterosexual—and argued that <b>such</b> <b>acts</b> could be used to focus the magician's will onto a specific goal such as financial gain or personal creative success. For Crowley, sex was treated as a sacrament, with the consumption of sexual fluids interpreted as a Eucharist. This was often manifested as the Cakes of Light, a biscuit containing either menstrual blood or a mixture of semen and vaginal fluids. The Gnostic Mass is the central religious ceremony within Thelema.|$|E

5|$|Augustine's Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean, {{which partly}} {{touches on the}} problem of evil, records a public debate between Augustine and the Manichaean teacher Fortunatus. Fortunatus criticised Augustine's theodicy by proposing that if God gave free will to the human soul, then he must be implicated in human sin (a problem that Augustine had himself {{considered}} four years earlier, in Free Will). Quoting the New Testament, Fortunatus proposed that evil exists beyond the evil acts people commit, and that people commit <b>such</b> <b>acts</b> because of their own flawed nature. Augustine replied by arguing that the sin of Adam constrained human freedom, in a way similar to the formation of habits. This was not a teaching on original sin (a view that Augustine was yet to formulate), but on the limitations of human freedom caused by sin. Fortunatus proposed that Augustine was reducing the scope of evil only to what is committed by humans, though Augustine writes that Fortunatus finally conceded the debate when he admitted that he could not defend his views on the origin of evil.|$|E
