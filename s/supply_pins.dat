For this reason, Atari style joysticks are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "digital joysticks", largely to differentiate them from the analog joysticks found on systems like the Apple II and IBM PC.

Because active cables are more compact and portable than passive cables, they {{are ideal for}} use with products such as smartphones, HDTVs, gaming consoles and DV cameras. DisplayPort is the latest consumer electronics standard that has enabled support for active cables by allocating power <b>supply</b> <b>pins</b> inside the connector. Active DisplayPort cables enable ultra-thin (32 AWG and thinner) and long-reach interconnects which are particularly valuable for the use with the miniature Mini DisplayPort form-factor.|$|E
50|$|Power <b>supply</b> <b>pins</b> on {{integrated}} circuits utilize the same letters for denoting {{what kind of}} voltage the pin would receive. For example, a power input labeled VCC would be a positive input that would presumably connect to the collector pin of a BJT transistor in the circuit, and likewise respectively with other subscripted letters. The format used {{is the same as}} for notations described above, though without the connotation of VCC meaning the voltage from a collector pin to collector pin; the repetition avoids confusion as such an expression would not exist.|$|E

50|$|As of 2011, modern PCs still {{maintain}} nearly complete backwards compatibility with the PC AT from a software perspective, but AT mechanical and electrical compatibility is extremely rare. The AT power <b>supply</b> <b>pins</b> and its connectors, the AT motherboard form factor, {{and the physical}} ISA bus slots are no longer present on modern PCs outside of specialized embedded designs. The ATX standard from Intel has completely replaced the original AT power supply and motherboard design. Modern motherboards do not have ISA expansion bus connectors any more, but a functionally equivalent bus lives on as the modern LPC bus for software compatibility. Nearly all PC BIOS ROMs, even modern UEFI based ROMs, include code which is backwards compatible with the original AT BIOS interrupt calls. Even the 0xaa55 signature in the master boot record is still required by many BIOSes to be present on an attached hard disk {{for it to be}} recognized as a valid boot device. The PS/2 successor to the AT keyboard interface still survives in the modern market, though it is increasingly being replaced by USB in new systems. The PS/2 keyboard interface is identical to the AT keyboard interface except for the connector; the AT uses a 5-pin DIN connector, while the PS/2 uses a 6-pin mini-DIN.|$|E
50|$|Some reviewers {{discovered}} that the AMD Radeon RX 480 violates the PCI Express power draw specifications, which allows a maximum of 75 watts being drawn from the motherboard's PCI Express slot. Chris Angelini of Tom's Hardware noticed that in a stress test it can draw up {{to an average of}} 90 watts from the slot and 86 watts in a typical gaming load. The peak usage can be up to 162 watts and 300 watts altogether with the power supply in a gaming load. TechPowerUp corroborated these results by noting it can also draw up to 166 watts from the power supply, past the limit of 75 watts for a 6-pin PCI Express power connector. Ryan Shrout of PC Perspective did a follow-up test after other reports and found out his review sample takes 80-84 watts from the motherboard at stock speed, and that the other PCI Express slots' 12 volt power <b>supply</b> <b>pins</b> were supplying only 11.5 volts during load on his Asus ROG Rampage V Extreme motherboard. He was not concerned about the voltage droop due to the specification's 8% voltage tolerance, but did note of possible problems in systems where multiple overclocked RX 480 cards are running in quad CrossFire, or in motherboards that are not designed to withstand high currents, such as budget and older models.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- High speed {{synchronous}} {{digital systems}} require large switching currents to facilitate rapid signal transitions. These large currents create voltage drops {{on the power}} distribution network and necessitate expensive chip packaging {{with a large number}} of <b>supply</b> <b>pins.</b> In this paper we propose a novel technique to reduce the dynamic transient current drawn from the <b>supply</b> <b>pins.</b> Our approach is based on sub-dividing the synchronous clocking into multiple sub-clocks with relative skew. This spreads the computa-tion across the entire clock cycle instead of largely occurring at the beginning. Timing constraints must also be obeyed, so that no races or timing errors are introduced. We propose an exact algorithm based on integer linear programming to solve this problem. We have used our method in the design of a 5 GHz ECL encoder chip to achieve a factor of two reduction in ground bounce, as shown by HSPICE simulations. We also obtained order-of-magnitud...|$|E

The device is biased using a constant current source, and the power <b>supply</b> <b>pin</b> voltage is monitored for changes. When the laser strikes an area containing a short circuit, localized heating occurs. This heating changes the resistance of the short, resulting in a change in power consumption of the device. These changes in power consumption are plotted onto an image of the device in locations corresponding to the position of the laser {{at the time that the}} change was detected.|$|R
50|$|Integrated {{circuits}} {{are often}} a source of EMI, but they must usually couple their energy to larger objects such as heatsinks, circuit board planes and cables to radiate significantly. On integrated circuits, important means of reducing EMI are: the use of bypass or decoupling capacitors on each active device (connected across the power supply, {{as close to the}} device as possible), rise time control of high-speed signals using series resistors, and IC power <b>supply</b> <b>pin</b> filtering. Shielding is usually a last resort after other techniques have failed, because of the added expense of shielding components such as conductive gaskets.|$|R

The <b>supplied</b> <b>PIN</b> is encrypted at the entry terminal, during this step, a secret cryptographic key is used. In addition to other transaction elements, the encrypted PIN is transmitted to the acquirer's system. Then, the encrypted PIN is routed from the acquirer's system to a Hardware Security Module. Within it, the PIN is decrypted. With a cryptographic key used for interchange, the decrypted key is immediately reencrypted and is routed to the issuer's system over normal communications channels. Lastly, the routed PIN is decrypted in the issuer's security module and then validated {{on the basis of}} the techniques for on-line local PIN validation.|$|R

I DDQ has been used extensively as a reliability screen for shorting defects in digital integrated circuits. Unfortunately, single-threshold I DDQ methods applied to devices fabricated in deep-submicron technologies result in unacceptably high levels of yield loss.

The technique does not increase the pin count for a typical smart sensor, as the transistor can be accessed via the <b>supply</b> <b>pins</b> and an existing digital input pin.

40|$|Inductive {{cross-talk}} within IC packaging {{is becoming}} a significant bottleneck in high-speed inter-chip communication. The parasitic inductance within IC packaging causes bounce on the power <b>supply</b> <b>pins</b> in addition to glitches and rise-time degradation on the signal pins. Until recently, the parasitic inductance problem was addressed by aggressive package design. In this work we present a technique to encode the off-chip data transmission to limit bounce on the supplies and reduce inductive signal coupling due to transitions on neighboring signal lines. Both these performance limiting factors are modeled in a common mathematical framework. Our experimental {{results show that the}} proposed encoding based techniques result in reduced supply bounce and signal degradation due to inductive cross-talk, closely matching the theoretical predictions. We demonstrate that the overall bandwidth of a bus actually increases by 85 % using our technique, even after accounting for the encoding overhead. The asymptotic bus size overhead is between 30 % and 50 %, depending on how stringent the userspecified inductive cross-talk parameters are. ...|$|E

This allows the chipmaker to better choose the chip package as well as the number of power supply pairs, and the integrator to fine tune the number of power supply networks and decoupling capacitors. The corresponding models may be elaborated either in the design phase or from measurements performed as soon as the silicon becomes available.
