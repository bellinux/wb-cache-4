25|$|The Ojibwe people <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> with European-Canadian leaders {{by signing}} {{detailed}} treaties before they allowed many European settlers into their western areas.

25|$|The Ojibwe are {{historically}} {{known for}} their crafting of birch bark canoes, use of copper arrow points, and cultivation of wild rice. In 1745, they adopted guns from the British for use against the Dakota nation of the Sioux, whom they pushed to the south. The Ojibwe Nation {{was the first to}} <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> with European-Canadian leaders for signing more detailed treaties before many European settlers were allowed too far west.|$|E
25|$|Clarke was Boyle {{lecturer}} for two years, {{and produced}} two books. The Newtonian theologians used the Boyle Lectures to attack opponents (Thomas Hobbes and Baruch Spinoza, deists and freethinkers in particular). Clarke's lectures <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> for further debates. He dealt in 1704 with the Being and Attributes of God, {{an example of}} a physico-theological system; and in 1705 with the Evidences of Natural and Revealed Religion. These books were later published together.|$|E
25|$|Impressionism did {{not make}} itself evident among Argentine artists until after 1900, however, and never {{acquired}} the kind of following it did in Europe, though it did inspire influential Argentine post-impressionists such as Martín Malharro, Ramón Silva, Cleto Ciocchini, Fernando Fader, Pío Collivadino, Cesáreo Bernaldo de Quirós, Realism, and aestheticism continued to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> in Argentine painting and sculpture, noteworthy during this era for the sudden fame of sculptor Lola Mora, a student of Auguste Rodin's.|$|E

25|$|Before World War II, James {{left for}} the United States, where he met Kwame Nkrumah, a student from the Gold Coast who studied at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. James gave Nkrumah a letter of {{introduction}} to Padmore. When Nkrumah arrived in London in May 1945 intending to study law, Padmore {{met him at the}} station. It was the start of a long alliance. Padmore was then organizing the 1945 Manchester Pan-African Congress, attended not only by the inner circle of the IASB but also by W. E. B. Du Bois, the American organizer of earlier Pan-African conferences. The Manchester conference helped <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> for decolonisation in the post-war period.|$|E
25|$|The Energy Cabinet has met {{less than}} once a year since its creation. Also, SERNA has not been {{proactive}} in its role as the Cabinet’s Secretary and Coordinator to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> and to supply the technical groundwork for decisions. CNE has had a marginal role {{due to lack of}} political support and resources. As a result of this void at the cabinet level, the national utility Empresa Nacional de Energía Eléctrica (ENEE) has become the default point for energy expertise, sought by the Government even in matters of policymaking and regulation, which contributes to a weak separation of roles among utility, regulatory agency and the ministry.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, many of {{the land}} cession {{treaties}} the British made with the Ojibwe provided for their rights for continued hunting, fishing and gathering of natural resources after land sales. The government signed numbered treaties in northwestern Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. British Columbia had no signed treaties until the late 20th century, and most areas have no treaties yet. The government and First Nations are continuing to negotiate treaty land entitlements and settlements. The treaties are constantly being reinterpreted by the courts because {{many of the}}m are vague and difficult to apply in modern times. The numbered treaties were some of the most detailed treaties signed for their time. The Ojibwe Nation <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> and negotiated the first numbered treaties before they would allow safe passage of many more British settlers to the prairies.|$|E

25|$|The Audiencia was {{a longstanding}} {{governmental}} institution in New Spain. (The first audiencia {{in the colony}} was created on December 13, 1527 and the second, on February 13, 1548.) In addition to functioning as a court of last resort, the Audiencia oidores also exercised important legislative and executive powers {{in the government of}} New Spain. In turn, the viceroy in one of his ex oficio positions served {{as the president of the}} Audiencia. This gave him important judicial powers along with his executive and legislative ones. (The viceroy could only <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> of the court. Only if a viceroy was a trained lawyer could he rule on cases before the audiencia.) The Crown had shown a strong preference for military men as viceroys, and those that did not have a military background generally had an ecclesiastical one. None were lawyers.|$|E
25|$|Early on, McGuinty {{set down}} three {{strategic}} imperatives. First, no tax cuts. This ran against {{the conventional wisdom}} of politics {{that you had to}} offer tax cuts to win; everyone from Mike Harris to Bill Clinton had campaigned on reducing the tax burden on the middle class. But McGuinty was determined that Ontario voters would accept that the money was needed to restore public health care and education services. Second, a positive tone. McGuinty wanted to avoid the typical opposition leader role of automatically opposing whatever the government announced, and instead, <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> with positive alternatives. While attacking your opponent was important, that would be left to caucus surrogates. Third, one big team. At the time, the Ontario Liberal Party was riven into factions. Peterson-era people distrusted more recent arrivals. Jean Chrétien supporters fought with Paul Martin supporters. McGuinty set a tone that divisions were left at the door.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} coronation, that of Queen Victoria in 1838, {{had been}} an unrehearsed and somewhat lacklustre event in the Abbey, though the newly extended street procession and celebrations around the country had been a great popular success. The success of Victoria's Golden and Diamond Jubilees had created the expectation that Edward's coronation would be {{an expression of the}} nation's status as a great imperial power. In December 1901, an Executive Coronation Committee was formed, whose leading member, Viscount Esher, worked closely with the King to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> for the event. Esher had been responsible for organising the Diamond Jubilee in 1897 {{and was one of the}} driving forces behind the renewed enthusiasm for royal ceremonial. The position of Director of Music was given to Sir Frederick Bridge, the organist and choirmaster at Westminster Abbey; the first Abbey organist since Henry Purcell to be given that role. Bridge had successfully transformed the quality of music at the Abbey and had directed the music at the Golden Jubilee, for which he had been made a Member of the Royal Victorian Order.|$|E

25|$|Gompers also <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> for {{the draft}} charter {{protecting}} workers' rights. The Americans made 10 proposals. Three were adopted without change: That labour should not {{be treated as a}} commodity; that all workers had the right to a wage sufficient to live on; and that women should receive equal pay for equal work. A proposal protecting the freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association was amended to include only freedom of association. A proposed ban on the international shipment of goods made by {{children under the age of}} 16 was amended to ban goods made by children under the age of 14. A proposal to require an eight-hour work day was amended to require the eight-hour work day or the 40-hour work week (an exception was made for countries where productivity was low). Four other American proposals were rejected. Meanwhile, international delegates proposed three additional clauses, which were adopted: One or more days for weekly rest; equality of laws for foreign workers; and regular and frequent inspection of factory conditions.|$|E
500|$|Brownlee was {{the only}} lawyer in a {{government}} composed primarily of farmers, {{and the rest of}} the cabinet drew heavily on his expertise. Its reliance on him extended beyond legal issues to such matters as how to write a business letter. Greenfield was among the most dependent, and forwarded most controversial issues to his attorney-general for a draft response; Greenfield often signed the draft and sent it out unchanged. [...] The premier eventually relied on Brownlee so heavily that Brownlee <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> for cabinet meetings. [...] The government also relied on Brownlee in the legislature, where it found itself under relentless attack from the John R. Boyle-led Liberals. [...] Brownlee had the widest debating experience of the UFA members, and he was increasingly called upon to counter these attacks. [...] His maiden speech was typical of him: [...] "I came into this House with considerable trepidation, because I knew that sitting opposite would be the former giants of this House, men with ability, experience, and skill. Since coming in I've listened to all these men—giving their best—and now I blush at my own modesty." ...|$|E
500|$|The period {{following}} Rudahigwa's {{death in}} July 1959, {{and the subsequent}} Tutsi [...] "coup" [...] against the Belgians, saw PARMEHUTU gain a decisive lead in popularity over Joseph Gitera's APROSOMA, {{as well as the}} Tutsi UNAR. APROSOMA favoured an inclusive approach to Rwandan nationalism, at a time when authoritarian Tutsi rule was fuelling the anti-Tutsi sentiment among the Hutu. PARMEHUTU's ascendancy was further enhanced following the November violence, when Guy Logiest appointed interim leaders primarily from that party, allowing them to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> and control the administration of the forthcoming elections. Despite this, PARMEHUTU claimed it still needed more time for the Hutu people to become [...] "sufficiently emancipated to defend their rights effectively", and successfully lobbied the Belgians to postpone the communal elections scheduled for January 1960. The elections were rescheduled for June of that year. In March 1960, a United Nations delegation visited Rwanda to assess the country's progress towards independence. The major political parties encouraged street demonstrations, which deteriorated into fresh outbreaks of violence, during the UN visit. Tutsi homes were burnt in view of the delegation, leading them to declare in April that Belgian plans for June elections were unworkable. Instead, they proposed a roundtable discussion involving all four political parties to end the violence.|$|E

5000|$|Agenda-setting {{theory is}} another work that Noelle-Neumann builds on {{as she is}} characterizing media's effect on the public opinion.

500|$|The first {{college course}} {{entitled}} [...] "Sociology" [...] was {{taught in the}} United States at Yale in 1875 by William Graham Sumner. In 1883 Lester F. Ward, {{the first president of}} the American Sociological Association, published Dynamic Sociology—Or Applied social science as based upon statical sociology and the less complex sciences and attacked the laissez-faire sociology of Herbert Spencer and Sumner. Ward's 1200 page book was used as core material in many early American sociology courses. In 1890, the oldest continuing American course in the modern tradition began at the University of Kansas, lectured by Frank W. Blackmar. The Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago was established in 1892 by Albion Small, who also published the first sociology textbook: An introduction to the study of society 1894. George Herbert Mead and Charles Cooley, who had met at the University of Michigan in 1891 (along with John Dewey), would move to Chicago in 1894. Their influence gave rise to social psychology and the symbolic interactionism of the modern Chicago School. The American Journal of Sociology was founded in 1895, followed by the American Sociological Association (ASA) in 1905. The sociological [...] "canon of classics" [...] with Durkheim and Max Weber at the top owes in part to Talcott Parsons, who is largely credited with introducing both to American audiences. Parsons consolidated the sociological tradition and <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> for American sociology at the point of its fastest disciplinary growth. Sociology in the United States was less historically influenced by Marxism than its European counterpart, and to this day broadly remains more statistical in its approach.|$|E

2500|$|He is, arguably, {{the most}} {{important}} philosopher {{who has worked in}} Australia. Certainly he was {{the most important}} in both the breadth and depth of influence. Among the philosophers who got their original intellectual formation from Anderson are John Passmore, John Mackie, A.J. ('Jim') Baker, David Stove and myself. There are lots more. But for every student who became a philosopher there were far, far, more in the law, in medicine, in journalism, in other academic disciplines, that were profoundly influenced by him.
