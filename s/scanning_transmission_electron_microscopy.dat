Crewe and coworkers at the University of Chicago developed the cold field electron emission source and built a STEM able to visualize single heavy atoms on thin carbon substrates.

2500|$|The single s-orbitals (...) {{are shaped}} like spheres. For [...] it is roughly a solid ball (it is most dense {{at the center}} and fades {{exponentially}} outwardly), but for [...] or more, each single s-orbital is composed of spherically symmetric surfaces which are nested shells (i.e., the [...] "wave-structure" [...] is radial, following a sinusoidal radial component as well). See illustration of a cross-section of these nested shells, at right. The s-orbitals for all [...] numbers are the only orbitals with an anti-node (a region of high wave function density) {{at the center of}} the nucleus. All other orbitals (p, d, f, etc.) have angular momentum, and thus avoid the nucleus (having a wave node at the nucleus). Recently, there has been an effort to experimentally image the 1s and 2p orbitials in a SrTiO3 crystal using <b>scanning</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. Because the imaging was conducted using an electron beam, Coulombic beam-orbital interaction that is often termed as the impact parameter effect is included in the final outcome (see the figure at right).|$|E

5000|$|In {{the field}} of biology, {{bright-field}} transmission electron microscopy (BF-TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) are the primary imaging methods for tomography tilt series acquisition. However, there are two issues associated with BF-TEM and HRTEM. First, acquiring an interpretable 3-D tomogram requires that the projected image intensities vary monotonically with material thickness. This condition is difficult to guarantee in BF/HRTEM, where image intensities are dominated by phase-contrast {{with the potential for}} multiple contrast reversals with thickness, making it difficult to distinguish voids from high-density inclusions. Second, the contrast transfer function of BF-TEM is essentially a high-pass filter - information at low spatial frequencies is significantly suppressed - resulting in an exaggeration of sharp features.

5000|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM) produces high magnification, high resolution images by passing {{a beam of}} electrons through a very thin sample. Whereas atomic resolution has been demonstrated with conventional TEM, further improvement in spatial resolution requires correcting the spherical and chromatic aberrations of the microscope lenses. This has only been possible in <b>scanning</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> where the image is obtained by scanning the object with a finely focused electron beam, in a way similar to a cathode ray tube. However, the achieved improvement in resolution comes together with irradiation of the studied object by much higher beam intensities, the concomitant sample damage and the associated imaging artefacts.
