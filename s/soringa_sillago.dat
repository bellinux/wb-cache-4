50|$|The Soringa whiting, Sillago soringa (also known {{simply as}} Soringa or <b>Soringa</b> <b>sillago),</b> is a poorly known species of coastal marine fish of the smelt-whiting family, Sillaginidae. The Soringa whiting is known {{exclusively}} from {{the east coast of}} India, inhabiting shallow inshore environments, particularly sandy substrates. S. soringa was first described in 1982 by Dutt and Sujatha, with the taxonomic status of the species was questioned by Roland McKay in his review of the Sillaginidae, with similar features to S. asiatica suggesting it is a senior synonym of the latter.|$|E
