5|$|After {{the deaths}} of the Gienkes, {{authorities}} began to investigate the cluster of deaths. The county sheriff, Fred Roshon, soon discovered that Martha Wise had signed at a local drug store for a series of purchases of large quantities of arsenic. An autopsy on Lily Gienke confirmed the presence of arsenic in her digestive tract. Brought in for questioning by the sheriff, Wise at first claimed she had obtained the arsenic to kill rats, but eventually confessed that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> it to poison family members by putting it in water buckets and coffee pots the family drank out of.|$|E
5|$|On 5 August 1999, a Haringey social worker, Barry Almeida, took Climbié to an NSPCC centre in Tottenham, {{where she}} was {{assigned}} to Sylvia Henry. There was some confusion {{as to why the}} centre was being referred to for the case. Henry later contacted Almeida and was told, according to Henry, that Climbié had moved out of the borough, thereby closing the case. Almeida said he could not remember whether this conversation did take place. On the same day, Kouao met Arthurworrey and Jones at the Haringey social services department, and claimed that Climbié had poured boiling water over herself to stop the itching caused by the scabies and that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> utensils to cause the other injuries. The social worker and police officer believed her, deciding that the injuries were probably accidental, and allowed Climbié to return home the following day, which she did.|$|E
5|$|The first {{accusation}} against Sherwood came {{to court}} in early 1697. Richard Capps alleged that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> a spell {{to cause the}} death of his bull. The court made no decision, and the Sherwoods filed a defamation suit against Capps that was resolved by a settlement. In 1698, Sherwood was accused by her neighbor John Gisburne of enchanting his pigs and cotton crop. No court action followed this accusation, and another suit for defamation by the Sherwoods failed. In the same year Elizabeth Barnes alleged that Sherwood had assumed the form of a black cat, entered Barnes' home, jumped over her bed, drove and whipped her, and left via the keyhole. Again the allegation was unresolved, and again the subsequent defamation action was lost. For each of the failed actions, Sherwood and her husband had to pay court-related costs.|$|E

5|$|Between 1870 and 1873, chemist and {{physicist}} William Crookes conducted {{experiments to}} determine {{the validity of the}} phenomena produced by three mediums: Florence Cook, Kate Fox, and Home. Crookes' final report in 1874 concluded that the phenomena produced by all three mediums were genuine, a result which was roundly derided by the scientific establishment. Crookes recorded that he controlled and secured Home by placing his feet on the top of Home's feet. Crooke's method of foot control later proved inadequate when used with Eusapia Palladino, as she merely slipped her foot out and into her sturdy shoe. In addition, Crookes' motives, methods, and conclusions with regard to Florence Cook were called into question, both at the time and subsequently, casting doubt on his conclusions about Home. In a series of experiments in London at the house of Crookes in February 1875, the medium Anna Eva Fay managed to fool Crookes into believing she had genuine psychic powers. Fay later confessed to her fraud and revealed the tricks <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>used.</b>|$|E

For several decades, she worked especially closely with Swiss kinetic artist Jean Tinguely, who also became her second husband. In her later years, she suffered from multiple chronic health problems attributed to repeated exposure to glass fibers and petrochemical fumes from the experimental materials <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> in her pioneering artworks, but she continued to create prolifically {{until the end of}} her life.|$|E

After Manson took her and another woman from California to New Mexico for {{purposes}} of prostitution, he was held and questioned for violation of the Mann Act. Though he was released, he evidently suspected, rightly, that the investigation had not ended. When he disappeared, in violation of his probation, a bench warrant was issued. An April 1960, an indictment for violation of the Mann Act followed. Arrested in Laredo, Texas, in June, {{when one of the}} women was arrested for prostitution, Manson was returned to Los Angeles. For violation of his probation on the check-cashing charge, he was ordered to serve his 10-year sentence.|$|E
25|$|Hall's {{first novel}} was The Unlit Lamp, {{the story of}} Joan Ogden, a young girl who dreams of setting up a flat in London with her friend Elizabeth (a {{so-called}} Boston marriage) and studying to become a doctor, but feels trapped by her manipulative mother's emotional dependence on her. Its length and grimness made it a difficult book to sell, so she deliberately chose a lighter theme for her next novel, a social comedy entitled The Forge. While <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> her full name for her early poetry collections, she shortened it to M. Radclyffe Hall for The Forge. The book was a modest success, making the bestseller list of John O'London's Weekly. The Unlit Lamp, which followed it into print, {{was the first of}} her books to give the author's name simply as Radclyffe Hall.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1974 Genie {{produced}} a few utterances with internal negatives, although she had specifically practiced {{all but two of}} these early sentences and one of the spontaneous occurrences was a partial imitation, and these sentences grew more common until she completely mastered their use by early 1975. Curtiss did not view this as linguistic movement, believing that Genie's grammar simply changed to place negations {{in the middle of a}} sentence. By {{the fall of}} 1974 Genie began differentiating between third-person pronouns such as he and she, but still had a high rate of error and did not use these, relative pronouns, and indefinite pronouns. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> locatives after subject noun phrases for a long time, but only did so after an object phrase in late 1974. At around the same time she had begun to use more than one prepositional phrase in some sentences, and in the spring of 1975 she fully comprehended the preposition between on tests.|$|E

25|$|She {{initially}} wrote a work on artistic training, Le dessin sans maître (1850), which {{explained the}} Cavé Method, {{which she said}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> since 1847. It aimed to exercise visual memory, a basic aptitude necessary for drawing. Delacroix wrote a favourable review in the Revue des deux Mondes of September 1850. A commission examined the method in 1850 and decided in favour of it and Lecoq's method (inspired by the same concept). The Minister of Public Education trialled Cavé's method in normal primary schools in Caen and Douai in 1862 and later the same year in those in Chartres. The results were judged to be satisfactory enough to recommend adopting the method in other normal schools. The assessors' arguments in favour of drawing training did not {{change the fact that}} they saw it as a pastime rather than an industrial skill - it is still impossible to say how far these methods were applied, if not by their inventors.|$|E
25|$|Yvonne Gilford {{grew up on}} a farm in Jamestown, South Australia, {{along with}} her parents and her only sibling, Frank. She became a nurse at the age of 28 and {{initially}} worked in Auckland, before moving onto London in 1973, and then Johannesburg in 1976. After working in various hospitals in the city for the next 20 years, she accepted a new job in Dhahran in April 1996, and moved to Saudi Arabia, with her ultimate aim being to earn enough money to retire from nursing and return to Australia. She initially found herself with few colleagues who spoke English, and rapidly befriended Parry and McLauchlan after they arrived in Dhahran in August of that year. For Parry it was her second time working in the country, having previously worked there between 1993 and 1994, while it was McLauchlan's first time working abroad, having been dismissed from her previous job for credit card fraud. It subsequently emerged <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> fraudulent references to obtain the job in Dhahran.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a hearing}} on 7 and 8 September 2016, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) panel found that Sharapova had a reduced {{perception}} of the risk that she took while using Mildronate, because (a) <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> Mildronate for around ten years without any anti-doping issue, (b) she had consulted the Russian doctor who prescribed the Mildronate for medical reasons, not to enhance her performance, and (c) she had received no specific warning about the change in status of meldonium from WADA, the ITF, or the WTA. However, the CAS panel also noted Sharapova’s failure to disclose her use of meldonium on her doping control forms {{and that she was}} at fault for (a) failing to give her agent adequate instructions as to how to carry out the important task of checking the Prohibited List, and (b) failing to supervise and control the actions of her agent in carrying out that task (specifically the lack of any procedure for reporting or follow-up verification to make sure that her agent had actually discharged his duty).|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{before the}} Bullet of Bullets (BoB) tournament, Sinon {{encounters}} Kirito, deciding {{to help him}} after believing he is female due to his avatar. After Kirito's true gender was revealed, an angered Sinon attempts to leave him, but they meet again during the BoB. The two are confronted by Death Gun, who causes Sinon's PTSD to relapse when his weapon was revealed to be a Type 54 pistol, the same weapon <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> in the post office shooting. She is rescued by Kirito and the two escape, though she is afraid to attack Death Gun. With his help, Sinon overcomes her fear and the two defeat Death Gun. Afterwards, the two end the tournament as co-winners after Sinon kills them both with a «Gift Grenade». Upon exiting GGO, Shino is visited by Shinkawa, who congratulates her on winning the BoB. However, angry at Kirito, he attacks her with intentions of raping and eventually killing her, revealing himself to be Death Gun's creator. Shino manages to resist his attack and escape, but is stopped by Shinkawa before she could exit the house; Kirito arrives and fights Shinkawa, the latter eventually being knocked out by Shino throwing her stereo at him.|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Puff is {{voiced by}} American actress Mary Jo Catlett, {{who is known}} for her live-action roles on {{television}} programs from the 1970s such as Diff'rent Strokes and M*A*S*H. As of 2017, voicing Mrs. Puff is her only regular television role; Catlett described herself as [...] "basically retired" [...] in 2013 since voice acting requires less preparation than performances in person. The About Group's Nancy Basille noted in 2016 that Catlett's [...] "rich, low tones as teacher Mrs. Puff recall other roles she has had," [...] citing Diff'rent Strokes and M*A*S*H as programs on which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> a similar voice.|$|E

The voice came naturally to Cartwright; prior to The Tracey Ullman Show, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> elements of it in shows such as My Little Pony, Snorks, and Pound Puppies. Cartwright describes Bart's voice as easy to perform, saying, [...] "Some characters take a little bit more effort, upper respiratory control, whatever it is technically. But Bart is easy to do. I can just slip into that without difficulty." [...] She usually does five or six readings of every line in order to give the producers more to work with.

500|$|In 1904 Romaine Brooks, {{the name}} she preferred, became {{dissatisfied}} with her work, {{and in particular}} with the bright color schemes that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> in her early paintings. She travelled to St. Ives on the Cornish coast, rented a small studio, and began learning to create finer gradations of gray. When a group of local artists asked her to give an informal show of her work, she displayed only some pieces of cardboard on which she had dabbed her experiments with gray paint. From then on, nearly all of her paintings are keyed to a gray, white and black color scheme with touches and tints of ochre, umber, alizarin and teal. By 1905 she had found her tonal palette and would continue to develop these harmonics her whole career.|$|E
