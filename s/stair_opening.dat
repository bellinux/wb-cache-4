50|$|The {{warehouse}} premises at 70/72 Kilbirnie Street {{was used}} as a cash and carry warehouse by the Sher Brothers company, selling textiles, clothing and household goods. It was built as a stables in 1899, but in common with much of Glasgow's industrial premises at that time, had seen numerous uses over the years. It was a brick built construction of ground, first and attic floors, connected by internal stairs and a goods lift. The first floor was of concrete construction, and the attic floor of composite steel and timber, supported on cast iron columns. Internal partitioning consisted of timber frames with hardboard lining. An external steel <b>stair</b> <b>opening</b> off the attic and first floors acted as the fire escape route. Stock was arranged on steel frame shelving and stacked on the floor. The potential fire load was considered high following a fire prevention visit in December 1971 and again in March 1972. It had been occupied by the owners since 1970.|$|E
50|$|The layout was {{square with}} four rooms {{on each of}} the two floors. The large wooden front door opened into a foyer. On the left of the foyer, along the south wall, was a flight of steps leading to the second floor. One could turn right into a parlor (the NE corner) or walk {{straight}} ahead into a dining room (SW corner). The kitchen was the NW corner of the first floor accessible from the dining room, and had a door to the backyard. On the second floor, there was a railing around the south <b>stair</b> <b>opening,</b> and a hall that ran beside the stairway {{to the front of the}} house. A central sitting room had a door onto the front porch. There was an entry door to both the NE bedroom and to the NW bedroom from the sitting room. The entry to the SW bedroom was through a door at the top of the stairs. Harry Jones added an indoor bathroom on stilts off the south side of the house, which was accessible from a door at the top of the stairs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The goal of our {{research}} is to develop methods for accelerometer-based gait recognition, which are robust, stable and fast enough {{to be used for}} authentication on mobile devices. To show how far we are in reaching this goal we developed a new cycle extraction method, implemented an application for android phones and conducted a scenario test. We evaluated two different methods, which apply the same cycle extraction technique but use different comparison methods. 48 subjects took part in the scenario test. After enrolment they were walking for about 15 minutes on a predefined route. To get a realistic scenario this route included climbing of <b>stairs,</b> <b>opening</b> doors, walking around corners etc. About every 30 seconds the subject stopped and the authentication was started. This paper introduces the new cycle extraction method and shows the Detection Error Trade-Off-curves, error rates separated by route-section and subject as well as the computation times for enrolment and authentication on a Motorola milestone phone.

5000|$|The Winecoff Hotel (now the Ellis Hotel) {{opened in}} 1913 {{as one of}} the tallest {{buildings}} in Atlanta. The steel-framed structure was built on a small lot measuring 62.75 ft by 70 ft, bounded by Peachtree Street, Ellis Street and an alley, with 4386 sq ft per floor. Guest rooms extended from the third to the fifteenth floors, with fifteen rooms on a typical floor. Corridors on guest floors were arranged in an H-shape, with two elevators and the upward flights of <b>stairs</b> <b>opening</b> into the cross halls, and opposing downward runs of stairs converging on a single landing from the legs of the H. The single stairway, of non-combustible construction, was not enclosed with fire-resistant doors. While the use of multiple stairways was becoming common practice in tall buildings, the Atlanta Building Code of 1911 permitted buildings on lots of less than 5000 sq ft to have a single stairway. The steel structure was protected by structural clay tile and concrete fireproofing. The hotel was touted in advertisements and on its stationery as [...] "absolutely fireproof".|$|R

5000|$|The fire, {{coming on}} the heels of the La Salle Hotel fire, had a major impact on {{building}} codes. [...] A national conference on fire prevention was convened in 1947 at the direction of U.S. President Harry S. Truman in response to the La Salle and Winecoff fires. [...] Both fires had highlighted the problems associated with unprotected <b>stair</b> <b>openings,</b> which provided paths for the spread of smoke (in the case of the La Salle Hotel) and fire (at the Winecoff), simultaneously preventing the use of the stairs for escape. The National Fire Protection Associations Building Exits Code of 1927 had already set forth principles requiring the use of multiple, protected means of egress, [...] and was further revised to allow the code to be incorporated as law. Emphasis in building design and construction was changed from the protection of property — the Winecoffs [...] "completely fireproof" [...] statement on its stationery was accurate insofar as it was confined to the buildings structure — to place primary emphasis on the protection of life, with property protection subordinated to that goal. Georgia Governor Ellis Arnall reacted to the narrowly defined [...] "fireproof" [...] statement, stating:The public is being defrauded when a hotel is advertised as [...] "fireproof," [...] but really isnt. Responsible agencies should prohibit the use of the word [...] "fireproof" [...] when a hotel is not really fireproof as the Winecoff obviously was not." ...|$|R

40|$|Our goal is {{to create}} a visual odometry system for robots and {{wearable}} systems such that localization accuracies of centimeters can be obtained for hundreds of meters of distance traveled. Existing systems have achieved approximately a 1 % to 5 % localization error rate whereas our proposed system achieves close to 0. 1 % error rate, a ten-fold reduction. Traditional visual odometry systems drift over time as the frame-to-frame errors accumulate. In this paper, we propose to improve visual odometry using visual landmarks in the scene. First, a dynamic local landmark tracking technique is proposed to track a set of local landmarks across image frames and select an optimal set of tracked local landmarks for pose computation. As a result, the error associated with each pose computation is minimized to reduce the drift significantly. Second, a global landmark based drift correction technique is proposed to recognize previously visited locations and use them to correct drift accumulated during motion. At each visited location along the route, a set of distinctive visual landmarks is automatically extracted and inserted into a landmark database dynamically. We integrate the landmark based approach into a navigation system with 2 stereo pairs and a low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for increased robustness. We demonstrate that a real-time visual odometry system using local and global landmarks can precisely locate a user within 1 meter over 1000 meters in unknown indoor/outdoor environments with challenging situations such as climbing <b>stairs,</b> <b>opening</b> doors, moving foreground objects etc [...] 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} diploma thesis was {{to compare}} {{the results of an}} {{analysis}} of a office building located in the suburbs of the town of Velenje, which was performed using the computer programs SAP 2000 and ESA PT. The building's load-bearing structure was analysed with respect to vertical loads and wind loadings, in accordance with the relevant Eurocode standards. Six different models, which varied according to the degree of simplification involved, were investigated. Various planar and plate element models were taken into consideration. The aim of the investigation was {{to determine the extent to}} which simplifying the model would affect the internal forces in the structural elements. For the determination of the internal forces in typical columns, analysis using the simplest planar model was sufficient. For columns and walls near <b>stairs,</b> <b>openings,</b> and other irregularities in the structure, more accurate models were required. The results which were obtained using the planar model were compared with the results obtained using the 3 D models, where the building's slabs were modeled by means of plate elements. For this purpose, the bending moments were distributed in the transverse direction in accordance with the provisions of Eurocode 2 and of the DIN 1045 standard. The results obtained when the bending moments were distributed according to DIN 1045 were in better agreement with those obtained in the more accurate 3 D models. Apart from the calculations themselves, the differences occurring in the input of the data about the structure and its loads, as well as the differences in the results obtained, were also studied. It was found that there was not a great deal of difference between the calculations made using the computer program SAP 2000, and those made using the program ESA PT. The main differences occur in the method of inputting the data, and in the results of the analyses. The computer program SAP 2000 permits more options in the data input process, whereas this process is easier in the case of the program ESA PT...|$|R

6000|$|... "The castle is large, {{the outer}} walls {{standing}} on a pleasant ascent from the river, but much overtopt by a high hill, on which the town stands, situated {{at the head of}} a rich and magnificent vale, formed by an amphitheatre of woody hills, in which flows the gentle Don. Near the castle is a barrow, said to be Hengist's tomb. The entrance is flanked to the left by a round tower, with a sloping base, and there are several similar in the outer wall the entrance has piers of a gate, and on the east side the ditch and bank are double and very steep. On the top of the churchyard wall is a tombstone, on which are cut in high relief, two ravens, or such-like birds. On the south side of the churchyard lies an ancient stone, ridged like a coffin, on which is carved a man on horseback; and another man with a shield encountering a vast winged serpent, and a man bearing a shield behind him. It was probably one of the rude crosses not uncommon in churchyards in this county. See it engraved on the plate of crosses for this volume, plate 14. fig. 1. The name of Coningsburgh, by which this castle goes in the old editions of the Britannia, would lead one to suppose it the residence of the Saxon kings. It afterwards belonged to King Harold. The Conqueror bestowed it on William de Warren, with all its privileges and jurisdiction, which are said to have extended over twenty-eight towns. At the corner of the area, which is of an irregular form, stands the great tower, or keep, placed on a small hill of its own dimensions, on which lies six vast projecting buttresses, ascending in a steep direction to prop and support the building, and continued upwards up the side as turrets. The tower within forms a complete circle, twenty-one feet in diameter, the walls fourteen feet thick. The ascent into the tower is by an exceeding deep flight of steep steps, four feet and a half wide, on the south side leading to a low doorway, over which is a circular arch crossed by a great transom stone. Within this door is the staircase which ascends straight through the thickness of the wall, not communicating with the room on the first floor, in whose centre is the opening to the dungeon. Neither of these lower rooms is lighted except from a hole in the floor of the third story; the room in which, as well as in that above it, is finished with compact smooth stonework, both having chimney-pieces, with an arch resting on triple clustered pillars. In the third story, or guard-chamber, is a small recess with a loop-hole, probably a bedchamber, and in that floor above a niche for a saint or holy-water pot. Mr. King imagines this a Saxon castle of the first ages of the Heptarchy. Mr. Watson thus describes it. From the first floor to the second story, (third from the ground,) is a way by a stair in the wall five feet wide. The next staircase is approached by a ladder, and ends at the fourth story from the ground. Two yards from the door, at the head of this <b>stair,</b> is an <b>opening</b> nearly east, accessible by treading on the ledge of the wall, which diminishes eight inches each story; and this last opening leads into a room or chapel ten feet by twelve, and fifteen or sixteen high, arched with free-stone, and supported by small circular columns of the same, the capitals and arches Saxon. It has an east window, and on each side in the wall, about four feet from the ground, a stone basin with a hole and iron pipe to convey the water into or through the wall. This chapel is one of the buttresses, but no sign of it without, for even the window, though large within, is only a long narrow loop-hole, scarcely to be seen without. On the left side of this chapel is a small oratory, eight by six in the thickness of the wall, with a niche in the wall, and enlightened by a like loop-hole. The fourth stair from the ground, ten feet west from the chapel door, leads to the top of the tower through the thickness of the wall, which at top is but three yards. Each story is about fifteen feet high, so that the tower will be seventy-five feet from the ground. The inside forms a circle, whose diameter may be about twelve feet. The well at the bottom of the dungeon is piled with stones."--Gough's [...] "Edition Of Camden's Britannia". Second Edition, vol. iii. p. 267.|$|R
