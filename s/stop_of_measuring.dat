They have determined the educational needs within the communities, obtained grant funding and worked collaboratively with the councils to deliver education and applied research programs that have helped homeowners and landowners take action to reduce their vulnerability {{to the risk of}} wildfires. Home structures have been modified to improve their fire resistance, fuel reduction programs have been adopted by local communities and maintained, communities have been mapped for evacuation plans and fuel breaks have been constructed on private and public forestland.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} effects of the {{antidepressant}} drugs duloxetine and fluoxetine on depressive behaviors in rodents. METHODS: Eighteen male Wistar rats were given systemic injections of duloxetine, fluoxetine, or saline prior to a Forced Swimming Test (FST). Immobility and number <b>of</b> <b>stops</b> were <b>measured.</b> RESULTS: Rats given injections of fluoxetine displayed significantly less immobility (p = 0. 02) and fewer stops than the control group (p = 0. 003).

40|$|If {{performance}} is {{a hallmark of}} the “new public management, ” do public networks perform? Since the publication of Osborne and Gaebler’s Reinventing Government (1992), public agency form and process is not enough to practitioners and academics alike, because these pillars <b>stop</b> short <b>of</b> <b>measured</b> results. Questions <b>of</b> performance extend beyond the hierarchical organization to the difficult arenas of interorganizational and intergovernmental collaborative efforts (Radin 2000), as public administration takes networks seriously (O’Toole 1997). One experienced practitioner (Linden 2002 : xvi) concludes, “Today’s enlightened leaders in both public and private sectors understand the value chains of which they are a part, and they know that most of their pressing problems can be solved by collaborative actions with others. ” Pattakos and Dundon (2003), experts on innovation, suggest that a true culture of innovation depends on efficacious collaborative activity. They indicate, however, that one of the biggest obstacles to building creative capacity is “how to capitalize on insights and ideas across the functional silos that thwart even the best intentions ” (15). The Agranoff and McGuire essay on “Big Questions of Public Network Management Research, ” (2001 a: 318) raised the issue of “whether public management networks produc...|$|R
40|$|The Time Digitizer {{capable of}} {{covering}} {{a range of}} 0. 34 sec in 9. 76 psec increments is described.

40|$|Rapidly {{stopping}} action engages {{a network}} in the brain including the right pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), the right inferior frontal gyrus and the basal ganglia. Yet the functional role of these different regions within the overall network still remains unclear. Here we focused {{on the role of}} the right preSMA in behavioral stopping. We hypothesized that the underlying neurocognitive function of this region is one or more of setting up a stopping rule in advance, modulating response tendencies (e. g. slowing down in anticipation <b>of</b> <b>stopping),</b> and implementing stopping when the stop signal occurs. We performed two experiments with MRI-guided, event-related, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), during the performance of variants of the stop-signal. In Experiment 1 we show that stimulation of the right preSMA vs. vertex (control site) slowed the implementation <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> (<b>measured</b> via stop signal reaction time) but had no influence on modulation of response tendencies. In Experiment 2, we showed that stimulation of the right preSMA slowed implementation <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> in a mechanistically selective form <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> but had no influence on setting up stopping rules. The results go beyond the replication of prior findings in showing that TMS of the right preSMA impairs the stopping process, including a selective form <b>of</b> <b>stopping,</b> by specifically disrupting implementation <b>of</b> the <b>stop</b> process. Future studies are required to establish whether this was due to stimulation of the right preSMA itself or because of remote effects on the wider stopping network...|$|R

40|$|Eight pigeons {{responded in}} a concurrent-chains {{procedure}} in which terminal-link schedules changed pseudorandomly across sessions. Pairs of terminal-link delays either summed to 15  s or to 45  s. Across sessions, {{the location of}} the shorter terminal link changed according to a pseudorandom binary sequence. On some terminal links, food was withheld to obtain start and <b>stop</b> times, <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> temporal control. Log initial-link response ratios stabilized within the first half of each session. Log response ratio was a monotonically-increasing but nonlinear function of programmed log terminal-link immediacy ratio. There was an effect of absolute terminal-link duration on log response ratio: For most subjects, preference for the relatively shorter terminal-link delay was stronger when absolute delays were long than when absolute delays were short. Polynomial regressions and model comparison showed that differences in degree of nonlinearity, not in sensitivity to log immediacy ratio, produced this effect. Temporal control <b>of</b> <b>stop</b> times was timescale invariant with scalar variability, but temporal control of start times was not consistent across subjects or terminal-link durations...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Evidence of {{the link}} between major sports events and {{increased}} participation at grassroots level is somewhat mixed. This paper examines attitudinal changes to sport participation among spectators associated with seven sports events held in Great Britain in 2014. Approach: Primary data was gathered from 4, 590 spectators aged 16 and over who attended one of the events. Both positive (inspiration) effects and negative (discouragement) effects were considered through the lens of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM). Findings: The evidence from this research indicates that event audiences belong primarily to the latter (more active) stages of the TTM. It was also found that attending sports events can further fuel the existing desire of contemplators to increase participation, whereas the catalytic effect among pre-contemplators is arguably less potent. Virtually no discouragement effects were observed across the different TTM stages. Research limitations: The research <b>stops</b> short <b>of</b> <b>measuring</b> actual changes in sport participation post-event of individuals in the different TTM stages and any attribution of such behaviour changes to events. This is both a limitation of the current research and a natural direction for future research. Practical implications: The main implications for promoting sport participation through the medium of sports events include attracting more people {{in the early stages of}} the TTM, greater collaboration between different event stakeholders and the building of sport participation strategies into the event planning phase. Originality: Models of behaviour change such as the TTM have seldom been applied to document the current and/or planned sport participation behaviour of individuals in a sport event context or to examine attitudinal changes towards sport as a result of attending an event. An adapted version of the TTM has been proposed to overcome the limitations of the traditional model...|$|R

We determined the rate of running red traffic lights among older drivers and the relationship <b>of</b> failure to <b>stop</b> to <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> vision and cognition. Methods. Multiple <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> vision and cognition were collected at the baseline examination of a population of 1, 425 drivers aged 67 – 87 years in greater Salisbury, Maryland. Each driver had real-time data collected on 5 days of driving performance at baseline and again at 1 year. Failure to stop at a red traffic light was the primary outcome. Results. Overall, 3. 8 % of older drivers failed to stop at red traffic lights, with 15 % of those who ran the light having failed 10 % {{or more of the}} traffic lights they encountered. A narrowing of the attentional visual field (AVF; the extent of peripheral vision in which objects are detected while attention is also centrally fixated) was associated with failure to stop at traffic lights at baseline and predictive 1 year later (incidence rate ratio = 1. 09 per degree lost, 95 % confidence interval = 1. 01 – 1. 16).
