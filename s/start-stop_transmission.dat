50|$|A common kind of <b>start-stop</b> <b>transmission</b> is ASCII over RS-232, {{for example}} {{for use in}} {{teletypewriter}} operation.|$|E
5000|$|Asynchronous <b>start-stop</b> <b>transmission</b> uses {{start and}} stop bits to signify the {{beginning}} bit ASCII character would actually be transmitted using 10 bits. For example, [...] "0100 0001" [...] would become [...] "1 0100 0001 0". The extra one (or zero, depending on parity bit) at the start {{and end of the}} transmission tells the receiver first that a character is coming and secondly that the character has ended. This method of transmission is used when data are sent intermittently as opposed to in a solid stream. In the previous example the {{start and stop}} bits are in bold. The start and stop bits must be of opposite polarity. This allows the receiver to recognize when the second packet of information is being sent.|$|E
50|$|Between 1952 and 1954 Fritz Karl Preikschat filed five patent {{applications}} for his teletype writer 7 stylus 35 dot matrix aka PKT printer, a dot matrix teletypewriter built between 1954 and 1956 in Germany. Like the earlier Hellschreiber, it still used electromechanical means of coding and decoding, but it used a <b>start-stop</b> method (asynchronous <b>transmission)</b> rather than synchronous transmission for communication. In 1956, {{while he was}} employed at Telefonbau und Normalzeit GmbH (TuN, later called Tenovis), the device {{was introduced to the}} Deutsche Bundespost (German Post Office), which did not show interest.When Preikschat emigrated into the USA in 1957 he sold the rights to utilize the applications in any countries (except for the USA) to TuN. The prototype was also shown to General Mills in 1957. An improved transistorized design became the basis for a portable dot matrix facsimile machine, which was prototyped and evaluated for military use by Boeing around 1966-1967.|$|R
