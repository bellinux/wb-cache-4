Product deformation, minor shifting and til-ting regularly occur and potentially damage improperly packaged and/or secured palletized goods. The research presen¬ted remedies the absence of academic attention concer-ning such horizontal dynamic effects by measuring the contact forces at load unit level occurring during transportation {{in addition to the}} cumulative effects at vehicle level. Consequently, the study’s results indicate that the significant horizontal dyna¬mic effects must be considered when judging the <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> securing practices and the effectiveness of transport packa¬ging.

40|$|A {{fracture}} condition {{incorporating the}} most unfavourable {{orientation of the}} crack has been derived to improve the <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>loaded</b> brittle components with complex shape, whose loading results in a three-dimensional stress state. With a single calculation, an answer is provided to the important question whether a randomly oriented crack at a particular location in the stressed component will cause fracture. Brittle fracture is a dangerous failure mode and requires a conservative design calculation. The presented experimental {{results show that the}} locus of stress intensity factors which result in mixed-mode fracture is associated with significant uncertainty. Consequently, a new approach to design of safety–critical components has been proposed, based on a conservative safe zone, located away from the scatter band defining fracture states. A postprocessor based on the proposed fracture condition and conservative safe zone can be easily developed, for testing loaded safety–critical components with complex shape. For each finite element, only a single computation is made, which guarantees a high computational speed.

40|$|With the {{potential}} {{to minimize the risk}} of many chronic diseases and the apparent biochemical <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> ingesting doses of oral vitamin D several-fold higher than the current recommended intakes, recent research has focussed on supplementing individuals with intermittent, high-dose vitamin D. However, two recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) both using annual high-dose vitamin D reported an increase, rather than a decrease, in the primary outcome of fractures. This review summarises the results from studies that have used intermittent, high doses of vitamin D, with particular attention to those finding evidence of adverse effects. Results from observational, population-based studies with evidence of a U- or J-shaped curve are also presented as these findings suggest an increased risk in those with the highest serum 25 D levels. Speculative mechanisms are discussed and biochemical results from studies using high-dose vitamin D are also presented. Emerging evidence from both observational studies and RCTs suggests there should be a degree of caution about recommending high serum 25 D concentrations for the entire population. Furthermore, benefit of the higher doses commonly used in clinical practice on falls risk reduction needs to be demonstrated. The <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>loading</b> doses <b>of</b> vitamin D should be demonstrated before these regimens become recommended as routine clinical practice.

40|$|Abstract: Due to {{the absence}} of {{provision}} for the load and resistance factors in design codes in China, designers often quote the provisions which are given in criterion or guidance of other countries such as USA. However, the partial <b>safety</b> factors <b>of</b> the <b>load</b> are various in different criterions. Based on the reliability theory, the load and resistance factors for progressive collapse resistance design of building structures were determined in this study. Firstly the simplified format of design expression in the ultimate state was obtained according to the expression in routine structural design. Then the failure probability of a structure during design reference period was taken as the sum of the probability of all incompatible failure events in this period, and the objective reliability index of the structure could be obtained. Finally using trial-and-error procedure and JC method, reliability analysis was performed for structural members to obtain the partial <b>safety</b> factors <b>of</b> <b>load</b> effects and resistance and the coefficient for combination value <b>of</b> <b>load</b> effects in design expression in the ultimate state.

Thirty consecutive adult patients were implanted with the Baha BI 300 (Cochlear Bone Anchored Solutions) in our tertiary referral center. Implants were loaded with the sound processor 3 weeks post-surgery. Follow-up examinations were performed at 10 days; 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks; 6 months; and 1, 2, and 3 years after implant surgery. At each follow-up visit, implant stability quotient (ISQ) values were recorded by means of resonance frequency analysis, and soft tissue status was evaluated according to Holgers' classification. ISQ trends, implant survival, and soft tissue reactions were compared to a population of 52 patients with the same type <b>of</b> implants <b>loaded</b> from 6 weeks post-surgery as part of another study. Subjective benefit was measured by means of the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI). After an initial dip in ISQ at 10 days after implantation, a gradually increasing trend in ISQ was found until 6 months in both populations, after which ISQ values remained above baseline values. Implant survival was 97 % in the study population and 96 % in the comparison population. Clinically relevant soft tissue reactions were found in 0. 9 % (study population) and 1. 7 % (comparison population) of all visits. Patients reported subjective benefit; the mean GBI score was 22. 8.

40|$|Antiplatelets {{represent}} {{a diverse group}} of agents that share the ability to reduce platelet activity through a variety of mechanisms. Antithrombotic agents are effective in the secondary prevention of ischemic strokes. Most strokes are caused by a sudden blockage of an artery in the brain (called an ischaemic stroke) that is usually due to a blood clot. Immediate treatment with antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin may prevent new clots from forming and hence improve recovery after stroke. Several studies have evaluated the role of one antiplatelet agent, aspirin, in reducing stroke severity. The International Stroke Trial (IST) of 20, 000 patients with acute stroke from other countries. In this study there was a significant 14 % proportional reduction in mortality during the scheduled treatment period (343 [3. 3 %] deaths among aspirin-allocated patients vs 398 [3. 9 %] deaths among placebo-allocated patients; 2 p = 0. 04). There were significantly fewer recurrent ischaemic strokes in the aspirin-allocated than in the placebo-allocated group (167 [1. 6 %] vs 215 [2. 1 %]; 2 p = 0. 01) but slightly more haemorrhagic strokes (115 [1. 1 %] vs 93 [0. 9 %]. Few studies examined the role of ticlopidin in acute stroke setting the results showed treatment with ticlopidine improved the neurologic outcome. In the Examining the <b>Safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>Loading</b> <b>of</b> Aspirin and Clopidogrel in Acute Ischemic Stroke and TIA (LOAD) study, 40 consecutive ischemic stroke patients were treated with 325 mg of aspirin and 375 mg of clopidogrel within 36 hours of symptom onset. Overall, 37. 5 % (n = 15) of the patients had an improvement of 2 or more points on the NIHSS 24 hours after antiplatelet administration. The antiplatelet efficacy of aspirin in preventing secondary stroke was established by three studies conducted in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s: the Swedish Aspirin Low-dose Trial (SALT) trials have demonstrated that aspirin-even in doses as low as 30 mg/day-reduces secondary stroke, MI, or vascular death in patients with. Clopidogrel and aspirin have been used in combination in patients with diverse arterial vascular diseases However, combinations of antithrombotic agents do not necessarily improve clinical efficacy and are typically associated with increased toxicity...|$|R

The dual system is then deterministically analysed using the finite difference method. Uncertainties associated with load conditions, material and sectional properties of the pile and soil properties are explicitly considered.

With help of realistic examples, the applicability, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm in the <b>safety</b> assessment <b>of</b> axially <b>loaded</b> pile-soil system are demonstrated.

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is a {{very common}} arrhythmia. In order to treat acute AF rapidly, effective drug regimens are required. Propafenone is a class IC antiarrhythmic agent that is suitable for oral loading as it reaches peak plasma concentrations within 2 to 4 hours of administration. The use <b>of</b> propafenone <b>loading</b> in patients with AF {{must be based on}} appropriate patient selection in view of the negative inotropic effect and the potential proarrhythmic effects of the drug. A series of controlled trials in patients with recent-onset AF without heart failure who were hospitalised with enforced bed rest has shown that orally loaded propafenone (450 to 600 mg as single dose) exerts a relatively quick effect (within 3 to 4 hours) and a high rate of efficacy (72 to 78 % within 8 hours). A potentially harmful effect of class IC agents is the risk of transforming AF into atrial flutter (3. 5 to 5 % of patients). However, atrial flutter with 1 : 1 atrioventricular response was observed in only two of 709 patients receiving propafenone (0. 3 % incidence). Nevertheless, the potential negative inotropic effect of propafenone demands careful patient selection, with systematic exclusion of patients with left ventricular dysfunction or congestive heart failure. Oral loading with propafenone can be considered as an episodic treatment in patients with AF recurrences, as has been proposed for other drugs in the past. However, the <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> oral <b>loading</b> with propafenone as an outpatient treatment in appropriately selected patients has to be assessed by appropriately designed prospective studies...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{study the}} <b>safety</b> and {{efficacy}} <b>of</b> a clopidogrel <b>loading</b> dose {{in patients with}} moderate and severe acute ischemic strokes. Background. The <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> clopidogrel <b>loading</b> has been extensively investigated in patients with minor strokes and transient ischemic attacks. Methods. Acute ischemic stroke patients presenting consecutively to our center from 07 / 01 / 08 to 07 / 31 / 13 were screened. Clopidogrel loading was defined as at least 300 [*]mg dose (with or without aspirin) given within 6 hours of admission. We compared outcomes in patients with baseline NIHSS > 3 with and without clopidogrel loading. Results. Inclusion criteria were met for 1011 patients (43. 6 % females, 69. 1 % black, median age 63). Patients with clopidogrel loading had lower baseline NIHSS than patients who were not loaded (8 versus 9, p= 0. 005). The two groups had similar risk for hemorrhagic transformation (p= 0. 918) and symptomatic hemorrhage (p= 0. 599). Patients who were loaded had a lower rate of neurological worsening (38. 9 % versus 48. 3 %, p= 0. 031) and less in-hospital mortality (4. 3 % versus 13. 4 %, p= 0. 001) {{compared to those who}} were not <b>loaded.</b> The likelihood <b>of</b> having a poor functional outcome did not differ between the two groups after adjusting for NIHSS on admission (OR = 0. 71, 95 % CI 0. 4633 – 1. 0906, p= 0. 118). Conclusion. Clopidogrel loading dose was not associated with increased risk for hemorrhagic transformation or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in our retrospective study and was associated with reduced rates of neuroworsening following moderate and severe stroke...|$|R
40|$|Background: Several studies {{comparing}} the efficacy and <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> prasugrel and clopidogrel in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary angiography (PCI) have been reported. The {{preponderance of the}} studies is in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Methods and results: We studied the 30 -day efficacy and <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> prasugrel <b>loading</b> compared with clopidogrel loading in 326 patients undergoing PCI for non-urgent indications (i. e. excluding patient with myocardial infarction) who were anticoagulated with bivalirudin during the procedure. Patients loaded with prasugrel were younger (63 vs 67; p =  0. 007) and had more history of cerebrovascular disease (15. 6 % vs 2. 7 %; p =  0. 008), heart failure (12. 8 % vs 5. 4 %; p =  0. 05) and prior PCI (32 % vs 22 %; p =  0. 05). Major adverse coronary events (MACE) and bleeding complications were analyzed during hospitalization and at 30  days. The bleeding and ischemic complication rates were similar and low in both groups. During hospitalization: MACE, 0. 6 % for clopidogrel vs 2. 0 % for prasugrel, p =  0. 33; No Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major bleeding in either group; TIMI minor bleeding 1. 1 % vs 0 %, p =  0. 5; access site hematoma 3. 4 % vs 2. 0 %, p =  0. 3. At 30  days: MACE, 1. 1 % for clopidogrel vs 2. 7 % for prasugrel, p =  0. 41; TIMI major bleeding 0 % vs 0. 7 %, p =  0. 45; TIMI minor bleeding 2. 2 % vs 4. 8 %, p =  0. 24. None of the differences was statistically significant. Conclusion: At 30  days, {{there were no differences}} in MACE or bleeding complications in patients anticoagulated with bivalirudin and given either clopidogrel or prasugrel during PCI for non-urgent indications...|$|R
