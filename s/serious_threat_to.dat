5|$|As a result, many {{countries}} in the Pacific region emulated the lead of Puerto Rico and introduced the toad in the 1930s. There are introduced populations in Australia, Florida, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Ogasawara, Ishigaki Island and the Daitō Islands of Japan, most Caribbean islands, Fiji and many other Pacific islands, including Hawaii. Since then, the cane toad has become a pest in many host countries, and poses a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> native animals.|$|E

C. mutica fouling populations may also incur minor economic effects through the cost of their removal from submerged aquaculture equipment and ship hulls.|$|E

However, there is now concern that these planarians may themselves become a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> native snails.

5|$|C. mutica {{are native}} to shallow {{protected}} {{bodies of water}} in the Sea of Japan. In as little as 40 years, they have become an invasive species in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and along the coasts of New Zealand. They are believed to have been accidentally introduced to these areas through the global maritime traffic and aquaculture. Outside of their native range, C.mutica are often exclusively synanthropic, being found in large numbers in and around areas of human activity. Their ecological and economic impact as an invasive species is unknown, but they pose a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> native populations of skeleton shrimp in the affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Cane toads pose a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> {{native species}} when {{introduced}} to a new ecosystem. Classified as an invasive species in over 20 countries, there are multiple reports of the cane toad moving into a new area {{to be followed by}} a decline in the biodiversity in that region. The most documented region of the cane toad's invasion and subsequent effect on native species is Australia, where multiple surveys and observations of the toad's conquest have been completed. The best way to illustrate this effect is through the plight of the northern quoll, as well as Mertens' water monitor, a large lizard native to South and Southeast Asia.|$|E

5|$|Following the RPF victory, {{approximately}} two million Hutu fled to {{refugee camps in}} neighboring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan Genocide. The camps were {{set up by the}} United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide. This regime was determined to return to power in Rwanda and began rearming, killing Tutsi residing in Zaire, and launching cross-border incursions in conjunction with the Interahamwe paramilitary group. By late 1996, the Hutu militants represented a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the new Rwandan regime, and Kagame launched a counteroffensive.|$|E
5|$|Inconsistent {{performances}} in the league, particularly away from home, meant Arsenal never posed a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Manchester United, the reigning champions. Midfielder Patrick Vieira was suspended from playing for much of late autumn after a confrontation with West Ham United player Neil Ruddock. In October, Arsenal notably staged a comeback against Chelsea, with Nwankwo Kanu scoring a hat-trick in the final 15 minutes of the game. A run of eight straight wins between March and May propelled Arsenal from fifth to second and the team finished on 73 points.|$|E
5|$|Overfishing is a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> {{seamount}} ecological welfare. There {{are several}} well-documented cases of fishery exploitation, {{for example the}} orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand and the pelagic armorhead (Pseudopentaceros richardsoni) near Japan and Russia. The {{reason for this is}} that the fishes that are targeted over seamounts are typically long-lived, slow-growing, and slow-maturing. The problem is confounded by the dangers of trawling, which damages seamount surface communities, and the fact that many seamounts are located in international waters, making proper monitoring difficult. Bottom trawling in particular is extremely devastating to seamount ecology, and is responsible for as much as 95% of ecological damage to seamounts.|$|E

5|$|The Mahdist Rebellion {{broke out}} in 1881 when a {{religious}} leader, the self-proclaimed Mahdi, declared a jihad against the Egyptian government, which had been subject to British domination since {{the construction of the}} Suez Canal around a decade earlier. Leveraging widespread resentment towards European influence in Egypt and preaching renewal of the Islamic faith, the Mahdi began to accumulate followers and soon presented a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the government. Early Egyptian-led efforts to suppress the movement failed spectacularly, and their humiliating defeat {{at the hands of the}} outnumbered, outgunned, and undersupplied Mahdist force only increased their leader's fame and reputation.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{continues}} {{to pose a}} <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> nearby towns and villages. Of the threats, {{the one with the}} most potential for danger is that of small-volume eruptions, which can destabilize glaciers and trigger lahars. Although much of the volcano's glacier mass has retreated, a significant volume of ice still sits atop Nevado del Ruiz and other volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif. Melting just 10 percent of the ice would produce lahars with a volume of up to 200million cubic meterssimilar to the lahar that destroyed Armero in 1985. In just hours, these lahars can travel up to 100km along river valleys.|$|E
5|$|This high {{concentration}} and oppressive {{treatment of the}} slave population led to rebellions. In 135 BC and 104 BC, the First and Second Servile Wars, respectively, erupted in Sicily, where small bands of rebels found {{tens of thousands of}} willing followers wishing to escape the oppressive life of a Roman slave. While these were considered serious civil disturbances by the Roman Senate, taking years and direct military intervention to quell, they were never considered a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the Republic. The Roman heartland had never seen a slave uprising, nor had slaves ever been seen as a potential threat to the city of Rome. This would all change with the Third Servile War.|$|E
