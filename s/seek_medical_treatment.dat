5|$|As the Cambodian {{economy was}} stagnating due to {{systemic}} corruption, Sihanouk opened two casinosin Phnom Penh and Sihanoukvillein January 1969. While the casinos satisfied his aim of generating state revenues {{of up to}} 700 million riels in that year, it also caused {{a sharp increase in}} the number of bankruptcies and suicides. In August 1969 Lon Nol was reappointed as Prime Minister, with Sisowath Sirik Matak as his deputy. Two months later, Lon Nol left Cambodia to <b>seek</b> <b>medical</b> <b>treatment,</b> leaving Sirik Matak to run the government. Between October and December 1969, Sirik Matak instituted several policy changes that ran contrary to Sihanouk's wishes, such as allowing private banks to re-open in the country and devaluing the riel. He also encouraged ambassadors to write to Lon Nol directly, instead of going through Sihanouk, angering the latter. In early January 1970 Sihanouk left Cambodia for medical treatment in France. Shortly after he left, Sirik Matak took the opportunity to close down the casinos.|$|E

40|$|Background: For {{the last}} 20 years, Sweden {{has changed from}} a {{homogeneous}} to multicultural society with about 20 % of immigrants born in other countries. The existing Swedish studies have not shown coherent results on how {{access to health care}} services varies by ethnicity. The aim of this paper was to analyze the association between country of birth and refraining from <b>seeking</b> <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> and whether socioeconomic disadvantage modifies this association. Methods: Cross-sectional Swedish National Survey of Public Health 2004. A population-based sample comprising of 14, 732 men (1, 382 immigrants) and 17, 115 women (1, 717 immigrants) aged 21 to 84 years. Country of birth was categorised as being born in Sweden, other OECD countries or other countries (non- OECD). The main outcome was the self-reporting of refraining from <b>seeking</b> <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> during the past three months. Data was collected within a three-month period during the spring of 2004 and was based on a postal self-administered questionnaire linked to registry data from Statistics Sweden. The nonresponse rate was 37 %. Main results: In {{spite of the fact that}} immigrants reported poorer health status, they were more likely to refrain from <b>seeking</b> <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> as compared to Swedish-born residents (odds for immigrants from other OECD countries were ORmen = 2. 2, 95 % CI 1. 8 - 2. 6 and ORwomen = 1. 8, 95 % CI 1. 5 - 2. 1 and for immigrants from other countries (ORmen = 3. 1, 95 % CI 2. 4 - 3. 4 and ORwomen = 2. 3, 95 % CI 1. 8 - 2. 9). Socioeconomic disadvantage (SDI) did not explain why immigrants fromother OECD countries had increased odds for refraining fromseekingmedical treatment. However SDI explained about 20 %of the increased odds for refraining from <b>seeking</b> <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> among immigrants from other (non-OECD) countries. Conclusions: Socioeconomic disadvantage does not fully explain why immigrants refrain from <b>seeking</b> <b>medical</b> <b>treatment.</b> Public health strategies towards the goal “care on equal terms” cannot be achieved without addressing wider socioeconomic determinants including interactions between class and ethnicity...|$|R

25|$|Sherman and her coauthors {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} communications between the gay and lesbian veterans with their VHA providers and the experiences regarding their healthcare services. Most of them report dissatisfaction with their medical treatment. Many veterans state that they do not receive the necessary support from VHA medical providers. Moreover, they claim that their healthcare providers are not receptive to their medical needs, and they have never been asked about their sexual orientation. Most of the veterans report that they do not feel at ease with their healthcare providers. The results of the study also show that some gay and lesbian veterans are disinclined to <b>seek</b> <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> from the VHA, {{and some of them are}} having trouble in finding equitable healthcare services. Based on the study, there are some inherent problems in the healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans.|$|E

40|$|Study objective: To analyse the {{association}} between perceived discrimination and refraining from <b>seeking</b> required <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> and the contribution of socioeconomic disadvantage. Design and setting: Data from the Swedish National Survey of Public Health 2004 were used for analysis. Respondents were asked whether they had refrained from <b>seeking</b> required <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> during the past 3 months. Perceived discrimination was based on whether respondents {{reported that they had}} been treated {{in a way that made}} them feel humiliated (due to ethnicity/race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age or disability). The Socioeconomic Disadvantage Index (SDI) was developed to measure economic deprivation (social welfare beneficiary, being unemployed, financial crisis and lack of cash reserves). Participants: Swedish population-based survey of 14 736 men and 17 115 women. Main results: Both perceived discrimination and socioeconomic disadvantage were independently associated with refraining from <b>seeking</b> <b>medical</b> <b>treatment.</b> Experiences of frequent discrimination even without any socioeconomic disadvantage were associated with three to nine-fold increased odds for refraining from <b>seeking</b> <b>medical</b> <b>treatment.</b> A combination of both frequent discrimination and severe SDI was associated with a multiplicative effect on refraining from <b>seeking</b> <b>medical</b> <b>treatment,</b> but this effect was statistically more conclusive among women (OR = 11. 6, 95 % CI 8. 1 to 16. 6; Synergy Index (SI) = 2. 0 (95 % CI 1. 2 to 3. 2)) than among men (OR = 12, 95 % CI 7. 7 to 18. 7; SI = 1. 6 (95 % CI 1. 3 to 2. 1)). Conclusions: The goal of equitable access to healthcare services cannot be achieved without public health strategies that confront and tackle discrimination in society and specifically in the healthcare setting...|$|R

25|$|Due {{uncertainty}} over what services are available under the National Health Service, how to access that care, {{and what to}} expect it from it, Somalis in the Manchester area reportedly often <b>seek</b> <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> in Germany. The German healthcare system was perceived by them as being very professional and responsive, with rapid access to specialist care and modern scanning technology. German doctors have also advertised on Somali television for many years, and this has developed as the main medical tourism route for the Somali communities. Research conducted with Somali health workers in London has also shown that many Somali women have bad experiences of giving birth in the UK. This can {{be the result of}} the mismanagement of care relating to female circumcision during both pregnancy and labour. The respondents also reported that, in addressing communication barriers, the importance of oral culture amongst Somalis is not sufficiently recognised. Furthermore, Somali women felt that the attitudes of midwives towards them were stereotyped and negative. Other research has shown that there is a perceived failure of social services to work with the Somali community in London, and that there is growing mistrust of the motives of social services.|$|E
25|$|During the 1946 Democratic Senate {{primary in}} Mississippi, his last race, Bilbo {{was the subject}} of a series of attacks by famed {{journalist}} Hodding Carter, Jr., in his paper, the Greenville Delta Democrat-Times. He won that primary against three other opponents with 51.0 percent of the vote; one of his rivals was Nelson Trimble Levings, who owned a Mississippi plantation and was an investment banker in New York City. As usual, Bilbo faced no Republican opposition in the 1946 general election. Based on a request by liberal Democratic Senator Glen H. Taylor of Idaho, the newly elected Republican majority in the United States Senate refused to seat Bilbo for the term to which he was elected because of his speeches. He was believed to have incited violence against blacks who wanted to vote in the South. In addition, a committee found that he had taken bribes. A filibuster by his supporters delayed the seating of the Senate for days. It was resolved when a supporter proposed that Bilbo's credentials remain on the table while he returned home to Mississippi to <b>seek</b> <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> for oral cancer.|$|E
