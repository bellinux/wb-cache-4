Most previous studies have examined soil Pb distributions by either urbanization gradient or land-use type. Few studies, however, have examined both factors together.

To fill this gap, we investigated variations in <b>soil</b> Pb <b>level</b> under different land-use types along the urbanization gradient in Beijing, China. We classified the degree of urbanization as the urban core, transitional zone, or suburban area and the land-use type as industrial area, roadside, residential area, institutional area, road greenbelt, park, or forest.

Three levels of rice straw (0, 2. 5, 5. 0 ton rice straw ha- 1) and N (0, 150, 225 kg N ha- 1) were applied at 0. 04, 0. 23, 0. 35 % <b>soil</b> salinity <b>levels.</b> Biomass yield of silage barley was influenced by the interactions between rice straw application and N fertilization. Although there was no single effect of rice straw application on biomass yield, it was significantly increased with N application and a rice straw application of 5. 0 ton ha 1. Sodium content in silage barley was significantly lower at 0. 04 % salinity level, and but it was statistically increased with increasing <b>soil</b> salinity <b>levels.</b> Forage qualities such as total digestible nutrients and relative feed value of silage barley were significantly higher with N application at 0. 04 % salinity level, but there was no effect of rice straw application.

25|$|Overuse {{and poor}} {{irrigation}} practices {{have led to}} increased salt content in the soil, reducing the productivity of the land. Irrigation salinity is caused by water soaking through the <b>soil</b> <b>level</b> adding to the ground water below. This causes the water table to rise, bringing dissolved salts to the surface. As the irrigated area dries, the salt remains. At Wakool in the Riverina region of New South Wales, irrigation salinity is mitigated through a salt interception scheme that pumps saline ground water into evaporation basins, protecting approximately 50,000 hectares of farmland in the area from high water tables and salinity. The subsequent salt has various uses including as an animal feed supplement. The program has returned to production over 2,000 hectares of previously barren farmland and encouraged the regeneration of native eucalypts.|$|E
25|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated {{transformation}} is another common technique. Agrobacteria are natural plant parasites, and their natural ability to transfer genes provides another engineering method. To create a suitable environment for themselves, these Agrobacteria insert their genes into plant hosts, {{resulting in a}} proliferation of modified plant cells near the <b>soil</b> <b>level</b> (crown gall). The genetic information for tumor growth is encoded on a mobile, circular DNA fragment (plasmid). When Agrobacterium infects a plant, it transfers this T-DNA to a random site in the plant genome. When used in genetic engineering the bacterial T-DNA {{is removed from the}} bacterial plasmid and replaced with the desired foreign gene. The bacterium is a vector, enabling transportation of foreign genes into plants. This method works especially well for dicotyledonous plants like potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco. Agrobacteria infection is less successful in crops like wheat and maize.|$|E

40|$|Lower <b>soil</b> {{phosphorus}} (P) <b>levels</b> are to {{be expected}} if more sustainable agriculture practices (organic farming, low-input farming) are adopted. Crop plants can be adapted to lower <b>soil</b> P <b>levels</b> by selecting and breeding for higher P efficiency. Longer root hairs are found to enhance the P efficiency of cereals by increasing the P uptake. In this study, three pairs of Swedish and Norwegian cereal cultivars (wheat cvs. NK 0058 and Diamant; 6 -row barley cvs. NK 94682 and Herse; 2 -row barley cvs. Tyra and Herta), with respectively short and long root hairs within each pair as measured in solution culture were grown. The cultivars were grown at four <b>soil</b> P <b>levels</b> (P 0 : 35 mg P-AL kg- 1 soil; P 16 : 49 mg; P 32 : 87 mg; P 48 : 130 mg) in a long-term PK fertilisation field trial. The choice of cultivars was based on root hair lengths measured in a previous solution culture experiment. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of cultivar and <b>soil</b> P <b>level</b> on P concentration (P utilisation efficiency), P uptake efficiency, grain chemical composition, root hair length, dry matter production, grain yield, root growth, 1000 -grain weight, hectolitre-weight and phenological development. The results showed higher dry matter production and grain yield at low <b>soil</b> P <b>levels</b> in Diamant, Herse and Herta than in NK 0058, NK 94682 and Tyra, respectively, indicating a higher P efficiency in these cultivars. Total P uptake at low <b>soil</b> P <b>levels</b> was also higher, and the P concentration (mg P g- 1 shoot dry matter, P utilisation efficiency) tended to be lower, suggesting higher P uptake and P utilisation efficiencies in these three cultivars. Probably the P uptake efficiency accounted for most of the variation between the cultivars, whereas variation in the P utilisation efficiency was of less importance. Dry matter production, grain yield and P uptake generally increased with increasing <b>soil</b> P <b>level.</b> However for most cultivars, except for the modern cultivar Tyra, dry matter and grain yield decreased at the highest <b>soil</b> P <b>level.</b> As <b>soil</b> P <b>level</b> increased, the differences in yield and P uptake within the three pairs of cultivars diminished, suggesting that the factors increasing the P uptake at low soil P are less important at high <b>soil</b> P <b>level.</b> Recordings of phenological development and grain moisture content confirmed that increasing <b>soil</b> P <b>level</b> increases the rate of development in cereals. 1000 -litre weight and hectolitre-weight were generally found to increase with increasing <b>soil</b> P <b>level.</b> Root growth in the topsoil was found to increase as the <b>soil</b> P <b>level</b> increased. The root hairs grew longer in field soil than in the previous solution culture experiment. The ranking of cultivars with regard to root hair was only in part similar to that found in solution culture, and the differences in root hair length was much smaller or insignificant in this study as compared to the solution culture experiment. Hence, ranking of cultivars in terms of root hair length might prove difficult. A previous study reported longer root hairs in barley as a response to lower <b>soil</b> P <b>level.</b> In contrast, these results suggested the opposite. The higher P uptake in Diamant, Herse and Herta might be due to longer root hairs. However, it is suggested that variations in other factors such as root exudation of organic acids and phosphatase and lowering of rhizosphere pH were as important factors for the higher P uptake. Grain concentrations of N, P, K, Ca and Mg were consistent with former findings. There were no effects of cultivar or P level on the grain concentrations of N, Ca and Mg in this study. In conclusion, this study suggested that there is great variation in P efficiency between cereal genotypes. This may only in part be explained by different root hair lengths. Adapting crops to lower <b>soil</b> P <b>levels,</b> by selection and breeding, is thus a possible means of increasing the sustainability of the agroecosystem...|$|R
