50|$|Knotting is a {{next level}} of {{proficiency}} in creating strands. Here the stringing medium (traditionally silk thread or another similar, <b>synthetic</b> <b>medium)</b> has knots tied into it {{as a means of}} separating the individual beads from each other. The traditional strand of pearls is a well-known example of this technique. Pearls are threaded onto silk, and a knot is tied between each one to not only space them for greater individual prominence but to also keep them from rubbing directly against each other and risking the abrasion of the nacre that gives them their luster. This classic design can be varied by adding or using other varieties of beads or varying the number and placement of knots used.|$|E

So far, no study presents a careful and rationalized assessment of the dehydration products for other <b>synthetic</b> <b>mediums</b> or studies their influence on the final fluoride material.
