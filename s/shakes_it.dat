5|$|Yotsuba goes to an udon shop {{without her}} father's knowledge, and {{is allowed to}} watch udon being made. After getting a pizza menu in the mail, the Koiwais order a couple, though one {{turns out to be}} too much for Yotsuba to hold. After an {{announcement}} of an upcoming camping trip, Yanda arrives with various bubble-blowing devices, which they play inside, then outside, with. Yotsuba, Fuka, and Fuka's classmate from chapter 45 go to a shrine to pick chestnuts, and Yotsuba learns about burr covers and bug infestations. Koiwai gives Yotsuba her own camera, which she uses to go around taking pictures of people. Yotsuba meets Miura at her apartment building, and they go to Ena's. On the way, a dog grabs her teddy bear and <b>shakes</b> <b>it,</b> making it smell like dog, so they wash it and dry it at the Ayases'. As a result, the bear's ability to speak is broken, so Asagi offers to repair it overnight. Yotsuba spends much of the intervening time sulking about Juralumin's absence until Yanda finally gets a reaction out of her. She goes to the Ayases', where she finds Juralumin repaired.|$|E
25|$|Jumping spiders are {{generally}} diurnal, active hunters. Their well-developed internal hydraulic system extends their limbs by altering {{the pressure of}} body fluid (hemolymph) within them. This enables the spiders to jump without having large muscular legs like a grasshopper. Most jumping spiders can jump several times the length of their bodies. When a jumping spider is moving from place to place, and especially just before it jumps, it tethers a filament of silk (or 'dragline') to whatever it is standing on to protect itself if the jump should fail. Should it fall, for example if the prey <b>shakes</b> <b>it</b> off, it climbs back up the silk tether. Some species, such as Portia, will actually let themselves down to attack prey such as a web spider apparently secure {{in the middle of}} its web. Like many other spiders that leave practically continuous silk trails, jumping spiders impregnate the silk line with pheromones that play a role in social and reproductive communication, and possibly in navigation.|$|E

500|$|Vengeance first {{received}} {{praise from}} several critics {{who attended the}} screening at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert wrote that the film had [...] "certain parallels" [...] with Clint Eastwood's 1992 film Unforgiven. In his initial review, Ebert awarded Vengeance 3½ stars out of four, describing it as [...] "a formula thriller done as an elegant genre exercise." [...] Justin Chang of Variety wrote that the film was [...] "a smoothly executed revenge thriller." [...] David Phelps, a film critic for The Auters concluded his review by writing, [...] "If not one of To's worst films, Vengeance {{is one of his}} best." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that was film a [...] "highlight" [...] of Cannes, writing, [...] "With his ruined face and pale snake eyes Mr. Hallyday holds the screen while Mr. To <b>shakes</b> <b>it</b> up." [...] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film's cinematography and editing: [...] "Cheng Siu-Keung's moody cinematography gives Vengeance a noir-ish sensibility while David Richardson's smooth editing pulls the action sequences together in a most satisfying way." [...] Mike Hale of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Vengeance is not top-flight Johnnie To...But the To poetry keeps breaking through: a gun battle in a city park stops and starts as clouds pass before the moon." ...|$|E
500|$|The British singer-songwriter {{unveiled}} the album at an industry playback in London, where EMI UK and Ireland president Andria Vidler hosted the event. Mark Sutherland from Billboard {{said that the}} album [...] "marks a return to Williams' trademark pop sound after 2006's more experimental – and commercially under-performing – Rudebox". Sutherland felt {{that even though the}} lead single 'Bodies', [...] "features a refinement of the more electronic sound debuted on Rudebox, much of the album returns to the fertile, adult pop ground of Williams' previous smash hit albums Escapology and Intensive Care". He felt that the album highlights are the [...] "lush ballads 'Morning Sun' and 'You Know Me', the intricate wordplay of 'Blasphemy' and the 1980s sound of 'Last Days of Disco'", while also noting that [...] "a confident-sounding Williams also experiments with some light psychedelia on 'Deceptacon' and electronic dance music on the anthemic 'Starstruck' and 'Difficult for Weirdos'." [...] Jude Rogers from The Quietus said that the song [...] "Do You Mind?" [...] "puts Status Quo, Slade and a gallon of glam-rock in a bottle, <b>shakes</b> <b>it</b> up, and make an interesting, if rather peculiar, froth." [...] Rogers said that on the track [...] "Starstruck" [...] "Goldfrapp's Felt Mountain, The Ipcress File soundtrack and the shadow of Broadcast fall over the first ten seconds of this song about our obsession with celebrity". [...] "Deceptacon" [...] contains a [...] "peculiar set of lyrics, floating on waves of reverb, sad strings and icy keyboards" [...] Rogers said that [...] "It's an unshowy meditation the shallowness of fame, with a fantastic, mournful outro." [...] Mike Diver from BBC Music said that [...] "Bodies" [...] is [...] "A strange brew of string flourishes, rumbling low end, oriental undertones and even an Enigma-style break into Gregorian territory", Diver also said that [...] "Last Days of Disco" [...] is [...] "reminiscent of Eurythmics".|$|E

2500|$|The {{story begins}} during a town festival to {{celebrate}} {{the arrival of a}} new bell. The town crier announces that, when it arrives, anyone who becomes married will be awarded a special gift of money. Swanhilda and Franz plan to marry during the festival. However, Swanhilda becomes unhappy with Franz because he seems to be paying more attention to a girl named Coppélia, who sits motionless on the balcony of a nearby house. [...] The house belongs to a mysterious and faintly diabolical inventor, Doctor Coppélius. Although Coppélia spends all of her time sitting motionless and reading, Franz is mesmerized by her beauty and is determined to attract her attention. Still upset with Franz, Swanhilda shakes an ear of wheat to her head: if it rattles, then she will know that Franz loves her. Upon doing this, however, she hears nothing. When she <b>shakes</b> <b>it</b> by Franz's head, he also hears nothing; but then he tells her that it rattles. However, she does not believe him and runs away heartbroken.|$|E

60|$|A jungle path. A lion's roar, {{a melancholy}} {{suffering}} roar, {{comes from the}} jungle. It is repeated nearer.

60|$|The {{hypothesis}} of Hylozoism, {{on the other}} side, is the death of all rational physiology, and indeed of all physical science; for that requires a limitation of terms, and cannot consist with the arbitrary power of multiplying attributes by occult qualities.

Far more prudent is it to admit the difficulty once for all, and then let it lie at rest.
