50|$|Lubricants {{that have}} <b>synthetic</b> base <b>stocks</b> even lower than 30% but with {{high-performance}} additives consisting of esters {{can also be}} considered synthetic lubricants. In general, the ratio of the <b>synthetic</b> base <b>stock</b> is used to define commodity codes among the customs declarations of tax purposes.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993 Cooper {{created their}} first single-shot rifle in [...]223 Remington. This rifle later became their Model 21. In 2005 They made their first rifles that had <b>synthetic</b> <b>stocks.</b> Previously all rifles had wood {{in a variety}} of grades. In 2007 the first Cooper {{repeater}} (non single-shot) rifle was created - the Model 52.|$|R

50|$|The Scout Squad is an M1A marketed toward law {{enforcement}} users. It has an 18-inch barrel, a forward mounted optical sight base, and a proprietary muzzle stabilizer. It is advertised as being optimal for Aimpoint optics, however, most mounts {{attached to the}} factory rail will still require a cheekrest {{in order to get}} the proper weld. It is available in both wood <b>stocked</b> and <b>synthetic</b> furniture options with different colours of wood and <b>synthetic</b> <b>stocks.</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{features}} dictated short, thin barrels, <b>synthetic</b> <b>stocks,</b> and bolt actions. Other {{optional features}} included a retractable bipod, detachable magazines, a butt magazine, and an accessory rail for lights and other attachments. The addition {{of some of}} these features often render the rifle technically not a scout as originally defined, but this has come to be accepted by many as still conforming to the spirit if not the letter of the concept.|$|R
50|$|Due to its {{relatively}} low cost and widespread availability and usage, the SKS {{has spawned a}} growing market for both replacement parts and accessories. Many aftermarket parts are available to modify the carbine—sometimes so considerably that it bears {{little resemblance to the}} original firearm. This may include items such as <b>synthetic</b> <b>stocks,</b> pistol grips, higher capacity magazines, replacement receiver covers (to allow the mounting of scopes, lasers, etc.), different muzzle brakes, recoil buffers, bipods, and more.|$|R

50|$|The Remington Nylon 66 is a rifle {{manufactured}} by Remington Arms from 1959 to 1989. It {{was one of}} the earliest mass-produced rifles to feature a stock made from a material other than wood. Previously the 22-410 Stevens combination gun had been offered with a Tenite stock. The firearms market generally lacked experience with <b>synthetic</b> <b>stocks,</b> making the Nylon 66 a risky gamble for Remington. The model name was taken from the polymer of the same name.|$|R
50|$|They are {{equipped}} with Police-specific walnut or <b>synthetic</b> <b>stocks</b> which are fitted with sling mounts. Walnut stocks lack checkering as found on the Express/Wingmaster models. 870P models come with matching walnut or synthetic forends that are shortened to prevent interference with most vehicle-mounted rack systems. The shortened forend also allows quick visual inspection of the magazine regardless of what position the forend is in, whereas the lengthened sport-type forend on other models partially blocks the loading port when pulled to the rear.|$|R
5000|$|The rifle is {{manufactured}} at the U.S. Repeating Arms Company (owned by FN de Herstal) to FN specifications using Winchester Model 70 actions. All current {{models of}} the SPR come in one {{of a variety of}} McMillan <b>synthetic</b> <b>stocks.</b> The earliest rifles were shipped in the H-S Precision aluminum chassis fiberglass version of the Winchester Marksman stock. While these [...] "First Generation" [...] rifles were simply dropped into the aluminum bedding blocks of the H-S Precision stock, the later guns are all glass bedded by hand.|$|R

50|$|Introduced in 1998, the {{synthetic}} model {{is identical to}} the standard 7600 except that it has a matte black <b>synthetic</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} models of the 110 series designed for different purposes. The basic 11/111 [...] "Hunter" [...] (blued carbon steel) models, 16/116 [...] "Weather Warrior" [...] (stainless steel) models, and 10/110FP [...] "Law Enforcement" [...] models include inexpensive wooden or <b>synthetic</b> <b>stocks</b> {{in order to keep}} costs down. While the stocks provided with these models are certainly functional, many users have noted a substantial improvement in accuracy after installing a higher quality stock. Other models, such as the 14/114 [...] "Classic" [...] and many of the 12 [...] "Varmint" [...] and 10FP [...] "Law Enforcement" [...] models are offered with high-quality stocks from the manufacturer.|$|R
50|$|The {{machine gun}} is {{equipped}} with a <b>synthetic</b> polymer <b>stock,</b> a folding bipod and open-type iron sights (sliding rear U-notch on a ramp with range settings from 200 to 1,200 m). A flip-up anti-aircraft sight is also provided.|$|R
5000|$|FN Special Police Rifles of all {{iterations}} {{are noted}} for being both very accurate (.5 MOA or somewhat less is not uncommon) and very low maintenance, featuring Parkerized metal finish, <b>synthetic</b> <b>stocks,</b> and a chrome-lined bore in the barrel. A chrome-lined bore offers a more durable, more corrosion resistant, and easier-to-clean barrel {{for the end}} user to maintain and is rarely found on precision bolt-action sniper rifles. The barrels of the [...] "First Generation" [...] rifles {{were said to be}} made from the hammer-forged blanks used for M240 General Purpose Machine Gun production at the FN Manufacturing Inc. plant in Columbia, South Carolina. Later barrels are said to be from hammer-forged blanks intended exclusively for FN Special Police Rifle production.|$|R
