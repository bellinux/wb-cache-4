The grove is about 340 acre with sequoias {{occurring}} on considerably less acreage as there are several pockets of mixed conifers without sequoias in them. The grove is primarily {{on the west side}} of the road and directly across the road from Redwood Meadow Campground. Redwood Meadow campground is adjacent to Long Meadow Grove, and Trail of 100 Giants winds through the grove. Along the trail through the grove are old sequoias. These include the Umbrella Tree, False Bonsai, <b>Spike</b> <b>Top,</b> and the Cedoia Tree (a cedar and sequoia tree growing together). The Quintet is a circle of five sequoias growing together. The largest known sequoia in this grove is Red Chief tree near Table Mountain, which is the 41st largest giant sequoia with a volume of [...]|$|E
5000|$|White {{was back}} on the stand being {{examined}} by J. Michael Flanagan. It was heard that, based on the diagram showing what Dr. Murray told the police he gave to Jackson on the night in question, it would not have presented any danger at all. White said that [...] "the dose of propofol we are talking here is 25 mg. This is a dose that produces little anxiety, little sleepiness." [...] It was heard that anesthesiologists are obviously trained in sedation. For non-anesthesiologists, most hospitals require certification to use sedation. White was then given a certificate to read. It was Murray's certification from Sunrise Medical Hospital approving him to administer moderate sedation. It qualifies the doctor to administer drugs to achieve moderate sedation; but he must monitor patients carefully. The certification also says the doctor is approved to rescue patients from deep sedation, manage compromised airway, and provide adequate ventilation. Flanagan and White went through simulations that Shafer put together with variables of amount of drugs and time administered. It was heard that {{the fact that there is}} some free lorazepam in the stomach, showing that Jackson took lorazepam orally at some point before his death. Flanagan went going through different scenarios with Dr. White that this could have caused Jackson's death. Dr. White then demonstrated how to mix propofol and lidocaine inside a syringe and administered it through a saline drip and Y tube. White injected 5 mg of propofol/saline mix into a cup to show that propofol doesn't go up the IV line and propofol sticks to the plastic tubing. He said that this is certainly a very safe way to inject propofol, and it was only 25 mg. [...] "My demonstration was probably close to what happened at the scene. You'd need a mechanism to drip the drug and hold this heavy bottle." [...] Flanagan asked if he could envision anyone using a slit IV bag to hang the propofol bottle when there's handle on the bottle? [...] "No." [...] White added: [...] "Why would anyone go through the hassle of cutting a saline bag to put bottle inside when bottle has a handle?" [...] Flanagan then asked how you would mix propofol solution with saline to make it 1-1 mg/ml? [...] "You pull tab off the bottle, <b>spike</b> <b>top,</b> then inject all the bottle of propofol into the saline bag, shaking the bag to make it 1-1 μg/ml." ...|$|E

25|$|Mace (gada) is {{the weapon}} of God Hanuman in Ramayana. Lord Vishnu also carries a gada named Kaumodaki {{in one of}} his four hands. In the Mahabharata epic, the fighters Bhima, Duryodhana, Jarasandha and Balarama were said to be masters of the gada. In the mace combat, Bhima wins the final battle against Duryodhana by hitting his inner thigh. Such an attack below the waist was said to be against the {{etiquette}} of mace duels, implying a degree of commonality to this type of fighting. It was and still is used as training equipment by wrestlers. The traditional gada (mace) was essentially a wooden or steel sphere mounted on a handle and with a single <b>spike</b> at the <b>top.</b> An alternative mace-head was the lotus-shaped padam. According to the Agni Purana, the gada can be handled in twenty different ways. Due to its weight, the gada is said to be best suited to fighters with a large build or great strength. The Mughal club or mace, known as a gurj or gargaj, had a head consisting of 8-10 petal-shaped blades. Fitted with basket-hilt, a spherical pommel, and a <b>spiked</b> <b>top,</b> this type of club was designed for beating down armour-clad opponents. Alternatively, some gurj had a <b>spiked</b> <b>top</b> and a hand-guard.|$|R

This unholy messiah predicted the hero would die when his power ring ran out of energy at a critical moment, while he was fighting an opponent or unprotected in hard vacuum. Abin Sur, worried by this prophecy, began using a starship for interstellar voyages, as an additional safeguard.|$|R

50|$|Until World War I the Tonkinese Rifle regiments wore uniforms closely {{modeled on}} {{indigenous}} dress (see photographs above). These included a flat salacco headdress of varnished bamboo, red sashes and head-scarves. The loose fitting tunics and trousers were usually of blue/black cotton, although a khaki version was adopted for field dress after 1900. The tirailleurs annamite {{wore the same}} uniform, with minor differences of insignia and with additional white clothing for summer wear. In 1912 a conical version of the salacco with a <b>spiked</b> <b>top</b> was adopted by all tirailleur units. This was worn until replaced by a pith helmet in 1931. During the same period the tirailleur uniforms were modified to conform with the standard khaki drill of the French Colonial Infantry, and the distinctive indigenous features disappeared.|$|R

5|$|On December 15, 2010, SOPHIA the 3rd made an {{appearance}} in the Flash game Super Mario Bros. Crossover, in its Version1.2 release. In the game, the tank possesses all abilities from Blaster Master and is the first character in the game to have a limited supply of ammunition; players need to collect power-ups from enemies in order to fire homing missiles, which is necessary to defeat Buzzy Beetles, <b>Spike</b> <b>Tops,</b> and Bullet Bills. The version also allows SOPHIA to grapple onto ceilings. On December 21, 2012, the game was updated to include, among other skins, a skin that changes the level, enemy, and interface graphics to those based on Blaster Master. According to the game's designer, SOPHIA was planned {{to be in the}} game from the beginning along with Ryu Hayabusa and Luigi, although they were left out of the first release due to time.|$|R
50|$|The {{coffered ceiling}} of {{recessed}} panels is flat directly above the altar (an area equivalent to three by one bays) but otherwise slanted downwards. The central columns, which stretch across the hall, form a {{wall behind the}} altar from which the altar paintings hang. The rear side is covered in mortuary tablets for the deceased, {{at the center of}} which is a statue of the Buddha Amithaba dating to the modern era. The central position of the wall and altar appear to sharply reduce the size of the worship space when compared to the relatively large area {{at the rear of the}} hall. Red fences with <b>spiked</b> <b>tops</b> (hongsalchaek) had originally been used to block passage from the rear to the interior of the hall but these were removed during the colonial-era. The inlaid blocks of the stone base were visible until they were covered with wooden flooring in 1998.|$|R

50|$|Memorial Avenue diverged {{north and}} south at the Hemicycle, passing through wrought iron gates into Arlington National Cemetery. The north gate was named the Schley Gate after Admiral Winfield Scott Schley, son of American Civil War Commanding General Winfield Scott and hero of the Battle of Santiago Bay during the Spanish-American War. The south gate was named the Roosevelt Gate for President Theodore Roosevelt. In {{the center of each}} gate, front and back, is a gold wreath 30 in in diameter. Each wreath cradles the shield of one of the armed {{services}} that existed in 1932: The United States Marine Corps and United States Army on Roosevelt Gate, and the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard on Schley Gate. (The United States Air Force did not exist until 1947.)

50|$|The {{length of}} the crested pigeon varies from 30 to 34 {{centimetres}} (12 to 13.6 inches). Colouration is grey with tinges of brown and green. It has a feathered but slender, black <b>spike</b> on <b>top</b> of the head. They run with the crest erect. The periorbital skin is bright orange. Wings have black stripes and are bronzed, while the primary feathers have colourful areas of brown, purple, blue and green. Immature birds have duller colours with no bronzing on the wings.|$|R

60|$|But what a joy! What a gladness {{to think}} that {{whatever}} humanity did, it could not seize hold {{of the kingdom of}} death, to nullify that.

The air they claimed too, shared it up, parcelled it out to certain owners, they trespassed in the air to fight for it.

60|$|The time has, therefore, {{come for}} a plain, clear {{statement}} of our experience. We have, as everybody knows, failed. We have been beaten hack all along the line. Our potatoes are buried in a jungle of autumn burdocks. Our radishes stand seven feet high, uneatable. Our tomatoes, when last seen, were greener than {{they were at the}} beginning of August, and getting greener every week. Our celery looked as delicate as a maidenhair fern. Our Indian corn was nine feet high with a tall feathery <b>spike</b> on <b>top</b> of that, but no sign of anything eatable about it from top to bottom.|$|R
60|$|Although we {{appeared}} at the stipulated place {{a quarter of an}} hour before the time, we found Mr. Micawber already there.

50|$|The Russian version {{initially}} had a horsehair plume {{fitted to}} the end of the spike, but this was later discarded in some units. The Russian <b>spike</b> was <b>topped</b> with a grenade motif. At the beginning of the Crimean War, such helmets were common among infantry and grenadiers, but soon fell out of place in favour of the fatigue cap. After 1862 the spiked helmet ceased to be generally worn by the Russian Army, although it was retained until 1914 by the Cuirassier regiments of the Imperial Guard and the Gendarmerie. The Russians prolonged the history of the pointed military headgear with their own cloth Budenovka in the early 20th century.|$|R

50|$|The gada (Sanskrit: गदा gadā, Tamil: gadai, Malay: gedak Old Tagalog: batuta) is a club or blunt mace from South Asia.

50|$|Two {{impressive}} {{examples of}} the military type are housed in the museums of Vienna, both from the sixteenth century. The first measures 2.35 m in length including the <b>top</b> <b>spike</b> which is 54 cm. The head is a separate wooden cylinder slipped {{over the top of}} the shaft and reinforced with steel bands, with five metal spikes in symmetrical arrangement. The second example has an all-steel head of complex craftsmanship with four V-shaped spikes mounted on a long shaft that measures slightly less than two metres in length. A twisted and braided steel bar joins the socket to the base of the <b>top</b> <b>spike.</b> There are also 183 surviving specimens in Graz, made in series and delivered to the arsenal in 1685. They are comparable in length to the previous examples and have three rows of spikes around the head. The wooden shafts of most morning stars of the military type are reinforced with metal langets extending down from the head. Still others can be found in the Swiss arsenals of Lucerne and Zurich.|$|R
