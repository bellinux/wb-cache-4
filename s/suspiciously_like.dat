Edna Gundersen of the USA Today said that Spice [...] "is assembly-line dance-pop", adding that [...] "only the funky 'Say You'll Be There' and touchingly cornball 'Mama' hint at depth".

Spill.com critics Corey Koleman and Co-Host 3000 gave the film a [...] "Some ol' bullshit", the site's second lowest rating. They criticized the film's overuse of slow motion, lack of explanation of certain plot elements and long lapses in between action, but gave the film points for its cinematography, small bits of action, 3D and the special effects of the Axeman. Andrew Barker of Variety compared the film to the previous installment as [...] "equally moribund, and perhaps even more shamelessly derivative". He compared Roberts' Wesker to Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith from The Matrix, calling it a [...] "slipshod impression". A particularly scathing review came from Brian Orndorf of Dark Horizons, who commented: [...] "Perhaps the first 3D motion picture to simulate the experience of watching paint dry, Resident Evil: Afterlife is a dreadful bore that only occasionally comes to life." ...|$|E
500|$|However, in his {{evaluation}} of The Secret Service as a whole, La Rivière {{argues that the}} premise of a secret agent masquerading as a priest while driving an antiquated car could not have appealed much to children, and that older viewers would have been disappointed with the series' unoriginal [...] "traditional espionage format". Ian Fryer concurs, writing in FAB magazine that [...] "very little about The Secret Service has obvious appeal to the traditionally young Supermarionation audience." [...] Discussing the opening theme music, he remarks that [...] "the younger me would have run a mile from any series which sounded like that." [...] He also notes that the opening credits [...] "broke with the tradition of having a thrilling or suspenseful promise {{of what was to}} come, and made the series look <b>suspiciously</b> <b>like</b> it might be about the life and work of an elderly vicar." [...] For La Rivière, the blending of puppetry and live action [...] "simply doesn't work. It requires more than the audience can give in terms of acceptance." [...] In the case of [...] "More Haste Less Speed", he points out that the character of Lady Hazlewell is portrayed in live-action distance shots by a stunt actor dressed in drag – an [...] "unintentionally hilarious moment that illustrates beautifully why the live-action inserts didn't work." [...] He further argues that the contrasting light levels of shots that alternate between one format and the other shatter the illusion of [...] "artificiality" [...] that previous series had been able to sustain in the absence of live action.|$|E

[...] Jay N. Miller from The Enterprise {{was impressed with the}} show, saying that the music was somewhere between industrial disco and house music with a rock edge, but [...] "always danceable". Philip Borof from Bloomberg Television reviewed the concert in New York's Madison Square Garden and found it average, calling the crowd decked in various costumes as the [...] "most entertaining". Toronto Stars Ben Rayner appreciated the show, exclaiming [...] "hot damn, that was one hell of a show Gaga brought to the Air Canada Centre Sunday night and suddenly it doesn’t seem redundant to add one more voice to the Lady Gaga choir."

500|$|The {{reviews for}} Lights and Sounds were mostly mixed upon release, {{particularly}} from mainstream media, but {{some critics have}} stated that the album had fallen well short of the standards of Ocean Avenue, the album's predecessor. Kelefa Sanneh of the New York Times, in review of the album, wrote: [...] "To listeners {{on either side of}} rock's latest generational divide, there's a big difference -- the difference of a decade -- between being a loser and being a twerp... Lights and Sounds is Yellowcard's attempt to split that difference." [...] Sanneh reports that the song [...] "Two Weeks from Twenty", one of the band's anti-war song, [...] "sounds <b>suspiciously</b> <b>like</b> Green Day; the lyrics echo the plot of the video for Green Day's 'Wake Me Up When September Ends'." [...] Despite this, Sanneh {{goes on to say that}} Yellowcard is still [...] "pretty good" [...] at [...] "writing sweeping, upbeat punk-rock love songs". Ben Breier of Kent News wrote: [...] "One thing is certain: The Yellowcard you grew to know and love circa Ocean Avenue is no longer with us. The band has vastly matured when compared to past records, but it comes at a price [...] members forgot what made them occasionally catchy and addictive in the first place. It's clearly the right direction for the band, but Yellowcard needs to further refine its new style before it can come up with something above average." [...] Mike Schiller of PopMatters, who was somewhat displeased with the album, wrote that the album does not [...] "make up for the overabundance of flaccid mediocrity on display throughout most of the album". Schiller went on to say, [...] "Lights and Sounds may be Yellowcard’s attempt at a big, serious album, but the band doesn’t sound even remotely ready." [...] Nick Cowen from Drowned in Sound wrote: [...] "Those who register for Pop-Punk 101 will receive Yellowcard’s Lights And Sounds as their first set-work; the Jacksonville quintet's new album would be the perfect teaching aid, as it's technically proficient while being boring and forgettable enough not to inspire the temptation to plagiarise." [...] Cowen concluded that the album [...] "is a substandard, second-tier album with some strings thrown in for good measure. It's really not worth the money in your wallet [...] even if that wallet is attached to a very long chain."

2500|$|John Painter {{states that}} {{nothing in the}} James passage looks <b>suspiciously</b> <b>like</b> a Christian {{interpolation}} and that the account can be accepted as historical.(Painter pages 139–142). Painter discusses the role of Ananus and the background to the passage, and states that after being deposed as High Priest for killing James and being replaced by Jesus the son of Damnaeus, Ananus had maintained his influence within Jerusalem through bribery.(Painter page 136) Painter points out that {{as described in the}} Antiquities of the Jews (...) Ananus was bribing both Albinus and Jesus the son of Damnaeus so that his men could take the tithes of other priests outside Jerusalem, to the point that some of whom then starved to death.(Painter pages 139–142). Philip Carrington states that {{there is no reason to}} question the authenticity of the Josephus passage on James, and elaborates the background by stating that Ananus continued to remain a power within the Jewish circles at the time even after being deposed, and that it is likely that the charges brought against James by Ananus were not only because of his Christian association but because he objected to the oppressive policies against the poor; hence explaining the later indignation of the more moderate Jewish leaders.|$|E
2500|$|From 1849, {{she was a}} {{contributor}} to The Southern Quarterly Review, The Southern Literary Messenger, and De Bow's Review. These essays were characterized, not only by sharp logic and scintillating wit, but by a spirit of earnest, conservation. Among the most prominent were [...] " [...] Justice and Fraternity," [...] "The Right to Labor," [...] "Diversity of the Eaces, its bearing upon Negro Slavery," [...] "Negro and White Slavery," [...] "Enfranchisement of Women," [...] "Uncle Tom's Cabin," [...] " [...] Carey on the Slave-trade," [...] "Negro Mania," [...] "Woman and her Needs," [...] "British Philanthropy and American Slavery," [...] "Charity which does not Begin at Home," [...] and [...] "A Letter to the Duchess of Sutherland from a Lady of South Carolina." [...] Davidson said that McCord was {{a contributor}} to the Southern Literary Messenger, to DeBow's Review, and to the Southern Quarterly Review. Examination of the complete files of the Southern Literary Messenger does not show her name; this is no negative proof, however. There are numerous anonymous articles, a few of which suggest McCord's style. A few poems are <b>suspiciously</b> <b>like</b> some selections found in [...] "My Dreams," [...] but because there is no signature her authorship cannot be inferred. In the editorial reminiscences secured and edited by Benjamin Blake Minor, one-time editor of the Messenger, McCord's name is not mentioned. The same problem is faced in a review of De Bow's Review. Her signature cannot be found, nor is her name acknowledged by J. D. B. De Bow in his quarterly Table of Contents. However, the Table of Contents of DeBow's Review lists only the signed articles; there are numerous unsigned ones. So accepting the statements of Duyckinck and Davidson, who agree that McCord contributed to these magazines, the assumption is made that for these magazines, except the Southern Quarterly, she worked anonymously. Though it is regrettable, it is true to type. Women authors often disguised their names under masculine noms de plume. However, most of her contributions to the Southern Quarterly Review were signed, and were easily available.|$|E

In a scathing review for NME, Mat Snow said, [...] "Dire Straits are so tasteful {{as to be}} entirely flavourless, so laid back as to bore me horizontal". He continued, [...] "So do you seriously {{want to hear about}} the further adventures of Mark Knopfler's mawkish self-pity, his lugubriously mannered appropriation of rockin' Americana, his thumpingly crass attempts at wit? Can anybody really be moved, stimulated or entertained by the tritest would-be melodies in history, the last word in tranquilising chord changes, the most cloying lonesome playing and ultimate in transparently fake troubador sentiment ever to ooze out of a million-dollar recording studio?" [...] Eleanor Levy of Record Mirror was similarly dismissive, succinctly stating, [...] "West Coast guitars reeking of mega bucks and sell out stadium concerts throughout the globe. Laid back melodies. Dire Straits – summed up... This is like any other Dire Straits album quarried out of the tottering edifice of MOR rock." [...] The reviews from the UK's other two music papers were less harsh, with Jack Barron of Sounds feeling that [...] "it's only a halfway decent album because it has only halfway decent songs... Knopfler has distilled his sonic essence, via blues, to appeal to billboard romantics with cinemascope insecurities. And he can pull it off well... but not often enough here." [...] Melody Makers Barry McIlheney observed that Knopfler had recently explored different creative directions with his work on movie soundtracks and on Bob Dylan's Infidels, and bemoaned that [...] "unfortunately for the rest of us, this admirable spirit of adventure fails to materialise when it comes to Brothers in Arms. Instead it sounds just a bit too like the last Dire Straits album, which sounded not unlike the last one before that, which sounded <b>suspiciously</b> <b>like</b> the beginning of a hugely successful and very lucrative plan to take over the world known as AOR... the old rockschool restraints and the undeniably attractive smell of the winning formula seem to block out any such experimental work and what you end up with is something very like the same old story." ...|$|E
