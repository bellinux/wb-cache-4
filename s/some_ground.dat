5|$|Most mantises chase tempting prey if it strays close enough, {{and will}} go further {{when they are}} {{especially}} hungry. Once within reach, mantises strike rapidly to grasp the prey with their spiked raptorial forelegs. <b>Some</b> <b>ground</b> and bark species pursue their prey in a more active way. For example, members of a few genera such as the ground mantises, Entella, Ligaria, and Ligariella run over dry ground seeking prey, much as tiger beetles do.|$|E

5|$|At some U.S. {{international}} airports, such as O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, some {{seating and}} waiting areas are {{located away from}} the terminal building, with passengers being shuttled to terminals. These areas may {{be referred to as}} ground transportation centers or intermodal centers. Amenities at ground transportation centers typically include restrooms and seating, and may also provide ticket counters, food and beverage sales and retail goods such as magazines. <b>Some</b> <b>ground</b> transportation centers have heating and air conditioning and covered boarding areas (to protect passengers from the elements).|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} another {{important}} defense found among species of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, usually being advertised by bright colors, such as the monarch butterfly. They obtain their toxicity by sequestering the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues. Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins. Predators that eat poisonous butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently, learning not to eat those types of species; this is actually the basis of Müllerian mimicry. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. <b>Some</b> <b>ground</b> beetles of the Carabidae family can spray chemicals from their abdomen with great accuracy, to repel predators.|$|E
5|$|Fighting stopped {{following}} a Croatian counter-attack that pushed the JNA {{back from the}} outskirts of Šibenik. Although <b>some</b> <b>ground</b> was lost to the Yugoslavs, especially around the town of Drniš, northeast of Šibenik, the ZNG captured several JNA and Yugoslav Navy facilities in the city, including dozens of navy vessels and several coastal artillery batteries. The captured batteries were used to support defence of the city. The JNA Šibenik garrison was evacuated {{following a}}n agreement between the Croatian officials and the JNA, except for several comparably small JNA posts in the city which were captured by the ZNG.|$|E

The presence of toxins and particles in <b>some</b> <b>ground</b> crew was deemed to be unrelated. On 4 April 2013, the distance and altitude flight restrictions were lifted after the F-22 Combined Test Force and 412th Aerospace Medicine Squadron determined that breathing restrictions on the pilot were responsible as opposed to an issue with the oxygen provided.|$|E
5|$|The {{fires in}} Yellowstone left {{a mosaic of}} areas greatly {{affected}} and others less so. Inside fire perimeters, large expanses of forest were completely untouched. There were three major types of burning. From an aesthetic viewpoint, the most destructive fires were the canopy crown fires that in many places obliterated entire forests. Crown fires accounted for about 41percent of all the area that burned. Mixed fires burned both the canopy and vegetation on the ground, or burned {{one or the other}} as they spread through the forest. Ground fires spread slowly along the ground, consuming smaller plants and dead plant material; <b>some</b> <b>ground</b> fires burned for longer duration and intensity, contributing to the loss of many trees whose canopies were never directly burned.|$|E
5|$|Beetles' flight {{wings are}} crossed with veins and are folded after landing, often along these veins, and stored below the elytra. A fold (jugum) of the {{membrane}} {{at the base}} of each wing is characteristic. Some beetles have lost the ability to fly. These include <b>some</b> <b>ground</b> beetles (Carabidae) and some true weevils (Curculionidae), as well as desert- and cave-dwelling species of other families. Many have the two elytra fused together, forming a solid shield over the abdomen. In a few families, both the ability to fly and the elytra have been lost, as in the glow-worms (Phengodidae), where the females resemble larvae throughout their lives. The presence of elytra and wings does not always indicate that the beetle will fly. For example, the tansy beetle walks between habitats despite being physically capable of flight.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 4–5 February 1917, the 13th Battalion—with Murray {{commanding}} A Company—attacked the German position at Stormy Trench. Preceded by a heavy artillery barrage, A Company seized {{the right of the}} position after overcoming stiff resistance, consolidating their gains by setting up a makeshift barricade. The Germans counterattacked, prompting Murray to send an SOS signal to the artillery officer, calling for more support. Although repulsed, the Germans counterattacked twice more. On the third attack, Murray organised a twenty-man grenade bombing party and led them in a charge against their attackers, pushing them back to their original start line. On another occasion when the company lost <b>some</b> <b>ground,</b> Murray rallied his men and retook it. Between midnight and 03:00, the company maintained spasmodic bombing, repelling further assaults with the aid of artillery support. By 20:00 on 5 February, the 16th Battalion relieved Murray's company, which had only 48 survivors from the 140 who had begun the attack.|$|E
5|$|The VRS and JNA {{attacked}} {{north of}} Ston on 11 April, pushing back {{elements of the}} HV 115th Infantry Brigade and elements of the arriving HV Guards Brigades for only modest territorial gain. The frontline stabilized by 23 April and the HV counterattacked and reclaimed <b>some</b> <b>ground</b> after 27 April. On 17 May, Bobetko ordered a major attack of the two full guards brigades. The 1st Guards Brigade was tasked with advancing to link up with the Ston Company guarding access to the Pelješac Peninsula and advance to Slano. The 4th Guards Brigade was ordered to secure the hinterland of the Dubrovačko Primorje by advancing along {{the rim of the}} Popovo field. At the same time, the JNA was pressured by the international community to pull back east of Dubrovnik to Konavle.|$|E
5|$|The terrain {{south of}} Ioannina {{provided}} excellent defensive ground. Moreover, the Ottoman forces further reinforced their positions with permanent fortifications, constructed {{under the direction}} of the German General Rüdiger von der Goltz. These were equipped with concrete artillery emplacements, bunkers, trenches, barbed wire, searchlights and machine gun positions. The Ioannina fortress area included two major fortresses, those of Bizani and Kastritsa, guarding the main southern approaches, along with five smaller forts in a ring around the city, covering the western and northwestern approaches. The forts were well supplied with artillery, totaling some 102 pieces (most of them 87mm). By December 1912, both sides were reinforced: the Ottomans received part of the Vardar Army, retreating after the Battle of Monastir, bringing their forces up to some 35,000, while the Greeks also brought up the 2nd Division from Macedonia and a number of volunteer regiments, for a total of 25,000 men. The Greeks launched a first attack on the fortress area on December 14. The Ottomans succeeded in repelling it in a series of actions that lasted until December 22, and even gained <b>some</b> <b>ground,</b> albeit at the cost of high casualties which depleted their numbers to some 26,000 men.|$|E

5|$|With {{his newly}} reorganised units, Dahlquist {{attempted}} a direct attack against Montélimar, which failed against the newly arrived German tank units. The subsequent German counter-attack gained <b>some</b> <b>ground</b> against the hills {{occupied by the}} Allies. Its aim was to push the Americans from the hills north of Montélimar and to force the American artillery to move back out of range. After the fighting the Germans captured a copy of Dahlquist's operational plans, giving them a better picture of the Allied forces. As a result, Wiese planned a major attack for 25August by the 11thPanzer Division {{as well as the}} 198th Infantry Division, together with some ad-hoc Luftwaffe battlegroups. This attack was, however, also a big failure. The Allies struck back, retook the hills north of Montélimar, and were able to establish a temporary roadblock on the German escape route. Again, this Allied success also did not last long, as another ad-hoc attack led by Wietersheim reopened the passage at midnight.|$|E
5|$|With the {{increasing}} Soviet resistance, a plan {{was made to}} concentrate on only one target. It was decided to halt the Ukhta-offensive and instead support the advance east of Kestenga in mid-August. This new drive {{was able to make}} <b>some</b> <b>ground</b> in the arctic no-man's land, but no decisive breakthrough could be achieved. The increasing Soviet activity also worried Siilasvuo, especially as Group F was now standing still in exposed terrain, open to a possible Soviet encirclement. To counter this, AOK Norwegen decided to bolster the Finnish forces for a final push to the east {{and the rest of the}} SS Nord division was moved south and put under Finnish command. Also parts of 6th Finnish Division were now moved south and returned to the Finnish III Corps for more reinforcements. Once the reorganisation had been completed, a new, final attack had to be launched by both Finnish battlegroups in October.|$|E
5|$|The next game, away to Scotland on 2 February, {{resulted}} in defeat for Wales, with the seven forwards system receiving {{much of the}} blame. The Williams–Gabe combination performed well on the left wing, but the Welshmen were unable to cross their opponents' line. Against Ireland at Cardiff Arms Park on 9 March, Wales fielded a team including eight Cardiffians. Gabe was appointed captain for the match, while Billy Trew - the former captain - and Dicky Jones, were replaced at halfback by Percy Bush, Cardiff's captain, and Dicky David, also from Cardiff and earning his first - and only - cap for Wales. Wales beat Ireland 29–0, and 26 of the points came from Cardiff players. In the first four minutes of the game, the Welshmen reached the Irish 25. Following a scrum, the ball reached Gabe, and he, after making <b>some</b> <b>ground,</b> passed to Williams, who ran in a try unopposed. Early in the second half, with Wales leading by two tries to nil, a lineout to Wales on the Irish 25, {{resulted in}} Williams receiving the ball and, after breaking through the Irish defence, with only Hinton, the fullback, to beat, passed to Gabe to score the try. Williams scored a second try after David, receiving the ball from the forwards, passed to Bush, who got past the Irish halfbacks, and passed to Gabe, missing out Evans. Gabe then ran up to Hinton, and passed the ball to Williams to score. A third try came for Williams in similar style, and he came close to scoring a fourth. The David–Bush halfback pairing, and the Gabe–Williams partnership on the left wing, supported by the excellent play of Winfield at fullback, {{and that of the}} forwards, were the decisive factors in the Welsh triumph over Ireland.|$|E
