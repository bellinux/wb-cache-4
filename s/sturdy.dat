5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog is a <b>sturdy,</b> muscular, compact {{dog that}} gives the {{impression}} of agility and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful muzzle. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with an alert, keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, <b>sturdy</b> toes and nails.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, Thomas {{was praised}} for his learning, his {{encouragement}} {{of education in}} his diocese, and his generosity. He was an excellent singer and composed hymns.

Throughout {{her career as a}} sculptor, <b>Sturdy’s</b> work has focused on nature, monumentality and resolved, balanced composition to the intent of reflecting anew the proportions of the environment. In The Wall Street Journal, Sarah Medford described <b>Sturdy's</b> 2017 piece [...] "Steel Screen" [...] as [...] "serene as an Asian landscape painting and, at 10 feet tall by 8 feet wide fully extended, as powerful as a mural." ...|$|R

5|$|In Texas, the Weather Bureau {{notified}} people {{early enough}} to allow mass evacuations: most coastal residents and camping visitors evacuated the vulnerable islands as the storm neared. Between 60–70% of Port Isabel's 500residents left before the storm, with the remainder sheltering in a <b>sturdy</b> brick store on the highest land available.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse have small, pigeon like {{heads and}} necks, but <b>sturdy</b> compact bodies. They have long pointed wings and {{sometimes}} tails and a fast direct flight. Flocks fly to watering holes {{at dawn and}} dusk. Their legs are feathered down to the toes.|$|E
5|$|Some {{countries}} have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert {{of a possible}} tornado (such as tornado watches and warnings in the United States and Canada). Weather radios provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States. Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far {{to the side of}} the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a <b>sturdy</b> shelter. If no <b>sturdy</b> shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are one of the worst places to take shelter during tornadoes, as the constricted space can be subject to increased wind speed and funneling of debris underneath the overpass.|$|E

5|$|The Russian Spaniel is a small, <b>sturdy</b> {{dog with}} a short, tight, silky coat with {{feathering}} on the ears and legs. Colors can vary greatly, and can include solid colors without white markings, piebald, speckled, black and tan, and combinations. The head and ears are also usually dark.|$|E
5|$|An old {{belief is}} that the {{southwest}} corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in a basement, under a staircase, or under a <b>sturdy</b> piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocus {{is among}} the most easily {{identifiable}} dinosaurs, with its typical sauropod shape, long neck and tail, and four <b>sturdy</b> legs. For many years, it was the longest dinosaur known. Its great size may have been a deterrent to the predators Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus: their remains have been found in the same strata, which suggests that they coexisted with Diplodocus.|$|E

50|$|Because of {{the extra}} weight and stresses, tandem wheels may use a higher spoke count, <b>sturdier</b> rims, higher {{pressure}} tires, a stronger freewheel, dishless spoke configuration, or asymmetric wheels. Tandems wear out rear wheels faster than front wheels; therefore, they may use non-symmetrical wheel setups, such as more spokes or a <b>sturdier</b> rim on the rear wheel.|$|R

5|$|Earth {{structure}} materials may be {{as simple}} as mud, or mud mixed with straw to make cob. <b>Sturdy</b> dwellings may be also built from sod or turf. Soil may be stabilized by the addition of lime or cement, and may be compacted into rammed earth. Construction is faster with pre-formed adobe or mudbricks, compressed earth blocks, earthbags or fired clay bricks.|$|E
5|$|Gender roles, {{especially}} {{the figure of}} the ideal woman, are central to La Cousine Bette. The four leading female characters (Bette, Valérie, Adeline, and Hortense) embody stereotypically feminine traits. Each pair of women revolves around a man, and they compete for his attention: Valérie and Adeline for Baron Hulot; Bette and Hortense for Wenceslas Steinbock. Balzac's study of masculinity is limited to the insatiable lust of Hulot and the weak-willed inconstancy of Steinbock, with the occasional appearance of Victorin as a <b>sturdy</b> patriarch in his father's absence.|$|E
5|$|Horses require routine {{hoof care}} from a farrier, {{as well as}} vaccinations to protect against various diseases, and dental {{examinations}} from a veterinarian or a specialized equine dentist. If horses are kept inside in a barn, they require regular daily exercise for their physical health and mental well-being. When turned outside, they require well-maintained, <b>sturdy</b> fences to be safely contained. Regular grooming {{is also helpful to}} help the horse maintain good health of the hair coat and underlying skin.|$|E

5|$|I Bonaparte {{chose to}} ride across the alps on a mule (obtained at a convent at Martigny) {{rather than a}} steed, the typical gentleman's mount at the time, because the mule was {{considered}} to be more sure-footed on the slippery slopes and narrow passes of the Alps, and to be more <b>sturdy</b> and hardy while making such a perilous journey on such volatile terrain.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 16th century {{production}} shifted from south Wales to mid and north Wales. The Shrewsbury Drapers Company in England took a dominant role in distributing Welsh cloth. From the 18th century there was strong demand for cheap, <b>sturdy</b> Welsh material shipped from Bristol, Liverpool or the Welsh ports to clothe {{slaves in the}} British colonies of North America and the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|It is a big, strong cat, {{similar to}} the Maine Coon breed, with long legs, a bushy tail and a <b>sturdy</b> body. The breed {{is very good at}} climbing, since they have strong claws. The {{lifespan}} is usually 14 to 16 years, though kidney and heart diseases {{have been reported in the}} breed. Specifically in this breed, complex rearrangements of glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause a perinatal hypoglycaemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sturdies</b> Bay is on {{the south}} east part of Galiano Island in British Columbia, Canada's Gulf Islands. It is known {{primarily}} for its ferry terminal which connects the island with other southern Gulf Islands {{as well as with}} the Lower Mainland via the Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal. There is also a settlement at <b>Sturdies</b> Bay comprising several businesses, homes and private moorages.|$|R
5|$|Most {{severely}} damaged was the agricultural industry. The worst loss in agriculture was from bananas and coconuts, of which about 75 {{percent of the}} crop was destroyed. Banana fields were completely destroyed, and in the southern portion of the island most coconut trees were blown down. Citrus trees fared better, due to the small yet <b>sturdy</b> nature of the trees. In addition, David's winds uprooted many trees {{on the tops of}} mountains, leaving them bare and damaging the ecosystem by disrupting the water levels.|$|E
5|$|On 10, 12 and 13 April, {{the lines}} {{held by the}} 104th Infantry in Bois Brule (near Apremont), and by the French to the left, were heavily {{attacked}} by the Germans. At first the enemy secured a foothold in some advanced trenches which were not strongly held, but <b>sturdy</b> counterattacks succeeded in driving the enemy out with serious losses, and the line was entirely re-established.|$|E
5|$|Reptiles {{evolved from}} amphibious {{ancestors}} which left the aquatic lifestyle and became terrestrial. To prevent loss of moisture reptilian skin lost the softness and moisture of amphibian skin {{and developing a}} thick stratum corneum with multiple layers of lipids which served as an impermeable barrier as well as provided protection from the ultraviolet. Over time, reptilian skin cells became highly keratinised, horny, <b>sturdy</b> and desiccated. The surfaces of the dermis and epidermis of all reptilian scales form a single contiguous sheet, {{as can be seen}} when the snake sheds its skin as a whole.|$|E
