Existing communication systems face increasing difficulties in fulfilling these requirements. In particular, the efficient provision of reliable group communication services in ATM-Networks remains a major unresolved issue.

40|$|One of {{the main}} issues {{emerging}} in satellite networks is the ecient and assured delivery of data. TCP/IP over ATM over poor quality links is known to fail catastrophically. The major source of this failure is that TCP incorrectly assumes all loss or corruption of data is due to network congestion, so TCP re-acts inappropriately. In general, two approaches can be consid-ered. In the rst approach, TCP distinguishes between conges-tion and non-congestion errors and handles the non-congestion errors properly. In the second approach, TCP is shielded from non-congestion errors, so that it doesn't invoke unnecessary con-gestion control mechanisms. In this paper, a Service Specic Coordination Function for Transparent Assured Delivery with AAL 5 (SSCF-TADA 5) is de-scribed. SSCF-TADA 5 operates to guarantee the transparent as-sured delivery of data in TCP/IP over ATM over degraded phys-ical link conditions such as those encountered on a satellite radio link, which is characterized by long propagation delay, high error rate with burst errors, and low throughput. Therefore, TCP is totally shielded from non-congestion errors resulting from poor physical link conditions. SSCF-TADA 5 coordinates between the user plane AAL 5 service interface and the Service Specic Con-nection Oriented Protocol (SSCOP), thereby forming a new Ser-vice Specic <b>Convergence</b> <b>Sublayer</b> (SSCS) supporting Classical IP over ATM. We discuss the design of SSCF-TADA 5, and then compare TCP/IP performance with and without SSCF-TADA 5. The results of the test show that assured delivery with SSCF-TADA 5 signicantlymitigates the degradation in the most severe cases, which combine high error rate with high channel utiliza-tion. ...|$|R

Foreword IEEE 802. 16 {{is a kind of}} broadband wireless access (BWA) standard which focuses on wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs). WiMAX is a concrete realization of 802. 16 protocol [1]. It is important to design a efficacious MAC architecture, because IEEE 802. 16 has not described the algorithm of QoS scheduling and net block control in detail [2]. We can solve this problem through simulating and analysis. NS- 2 is very commonly used network simulation software in the industrial and academic field. However, the software is not designed to support IEEE 802. 16, for this reason, in this paper we will design the MAC architecture based on 802. 16 protocol and simulate on NS- 2. The design will be developed in the way of inheriting the original NS- 2 class. Design of MAC layer based on 802. 16 Developed using object-oriented programming language C++ ， The created WiMAX are based on the original NS- 2 network components. Figure 1 shows a variety of object types and their relationship. In the design, WiMAX is divided into service specific convergence sub-layer (CS), MAC common part sub-layer (CPS), and physical layer (PHY) [3].

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} transmission of audio-visual applications (e. g. MPEG- 2) over ATM best effort services, such as Available Bit-Rate (ABR) and Unspecific Bit-Rate (UBR), efficient video-oriented control mechanisms for improving the video quality {{in the presence of}} loss have to be designed. In this thesis, we proposed and evaluated a new quality of service control framework for use with modified Unspecific Bit Rate service. We surveyed a number of issues related to the coding and control of MPEG- 2 video data streams transmitted over ATM networks, analyzed the network factors affecting the quality of service of real-time video applications and showed how this proposed video-oriented QoS control framework improve the performance for such services. The presented framework relies on four components: a dynamic frame-level priority data partition mechanism based on MPEG- 2 data structure and feedback from the network; an enhanced ATM Adaptation Layer type 5 (AAL- 5) associated with a new slice-based MPEG- 2 encapsulation strategy; a forward error correction (FEC) mechanism, which is implemented at the AAL- 5 service specific <b>convergence</b> <b>sublayer</b> to provide the error detection and recovery capability, and a video-oriented cell discarding scheme, which adaptively and selectively adjusts discard level according to switch buffer occupancy, video cell payload types and FEC drop tolerance. This best-effort video delivery framework is evaluated using simulation and real MPEG- 2 video data. The overall objective of this proposed framework is twofold. First, ensuring a graceful picture quality degradation by minimizing cell loss probability for critical video data while guaranteeing a bounded cell transfer delay. Second, optimizing the network effective throughput by reducing the transmission of non useful data. In comparison to previous approaches, the performance evaluation has shown a significant reduction of the bad throughput and minimization of losses of Intra- and Predictive-coded frames at the video slice layer...|$|R
40|$|The IEEE 802. 16 {{standard}} specifies the {{air interface}} of the fixed {{broadband wireless access}} (BWA) including the Media Access Control (MAC) layer supporting primarily Point to Multi Point PMP and optional MESH mode. The MAC is structured to support multiple physical specifications, each suits a different operational band. For 10 - 66 a direct line of sight is required between the BS and the Costumer Premises Equipment CPE with a single carrier. For the band lower than the 11 GHz, near line of sight or non line of sight is enough using three physical layer specifications: single carrier,OFDM, OFDMA. The MAC layer consists of three <b>sublayers</b> : the <b>Convergence</b> <b>Sublayer</b> {{which is responsible for}} mapping the different services to the specific MAC service data units (SDUs). The Common Part Sublayer is core of the MAC layer. It is responsible for packet scheduling according to the QoS requirements. The lowest sublayer is the Security Sublayer which is responsible for the key exchange and encryption. The standard revises are the IEEE 802. 16, IEEE 802. 16 a,IEEE 802. 16 c and IEEE 802. 16 d. This project simulates and evaluate IEEE 802. 16 a concentrating on the physical layer and the three MAC sublayers using the point to multipoint access, the OFDM mode which is suitable for the license exempt bands. The Encryption algorithm used is the double keys triple Data Encryption Standard (DES) with, EBC mode,FIPS 81. Assuming packet by packet processing, a 128 bytes packet needs 16 rounds of encryption using the same keys. MATLAB version 7 simulation was built {{for the sake of the}} performance analysis. All mandatory blocks in the IEEE 802. 16 a specification are included : Scheduler, Encryption, randomizer, Forward Error Correction (FEC) which includes Reed Solomon encoder, Convolutional Encoder, Interleaver and the Mapper, OFDM was simulated using 256 FFT. The channel was assumed to be Rican channel,the channel estimator. To enhance the BER, diversity technique with maximal ration combining is also simulated. The rate ID was chosen according to the SNR,and the number of packets that can be sent in one time slot are 6, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2 packets as the rate ID increases. The so called the Unsolicited Grant Services are assigned a constant number of time slots. The scheduler chooses the connection having the highest priority function which is determined by the type of the connection and the ii state of the channel. If the satisfaction delay in the case of the real time services and the rate satisfaction in the case of the non real time services is not satisfied, the priority function is set to the maximum value. A desirable property of any encryption algorithm is that a small change in either the plain text or the key produces significant change in the cipher text. In particular, a change in one bit of the plain text or one bit in the key should produce a change in many bits of the cipher text. Avalanche effect test shows a change in a single bit produces difference in about half the ciphered block. The diversity results shows that the BER is enhanced dramatically by using the diversity technique. The BER is also increased as the Rate ID increases. However, when the Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) is used,the BER is set to the prescribed value 10 - 1. The results shows that CP also enhances the BER performance...|$|R
