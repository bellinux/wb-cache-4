5000|$|The ISPS Code {{states that}} it is the sole {{responsibility}} of the Company Security Officer (CSO) and Company to approve the Ship Security Officer (SSO). This process must be approved by the Administration of the flag state on the ship or verified security organization with approval of the Ship Security Plan or Vessel Security Plan (VSP).The ISPS Code ensures that before the VSP is set in place that Vessel Security Assessments must be taken (VSA). The Vessel Security Plan must address every requirement in the Vessel Security Assessment. The VSP must establish a number of important roles and steps to provide safety for the marine vessel. Therefore, the VSP must include procedures to allow necessary communication that shall be enforced at all times. The VSP has to include procedures that assessed for the performance of daily security protocols. It also must include the assessment of security surveillance equipment systems to detect malfunctioning parts. ISPS code requires the that the Vessel Security Plan must have <b>strict</b> <b>procedure</b> and practices for the vital protection of Sensitive Security Information (SSI) that is either in the form of electronic or paper.

30|$|Teachers {{received}} a <b>strict</b> <b>procedure</b> {{on how to}} present the CAPTT. The procedure prescribed the order of presenting the chapters concerning the six error type categories. Every teacher {{received a}}n individual instruction for the order {{of dealing with the}} various chapters in order to minimize the effect of error type categories being dealt with first or last, on the end result of the sampled group. The teachers were also instructed to only use the CAPTT’s introduction to introduce the topic (English pronunciation) and to use no more than five minutes to introduce each chapter, using the background information on phonetics provided by the CAPTT in the teacher’s section. For the pre- and post-intervention test there was a <b>strict</b> <b>procedure</b> as well. The teacher’s role was one of facilitating (essentially run the CAPTT) and providing guidance only if necessary (and so not one of traditional instructing and teaching).|$|E

40|$|An {{extension}} of scientific rigor Minding {{the business of}} scientific reporting Among the synonyms of rigor are thoroughness, accuracy, validity, precision, exactitude, conscien-tiousness, meticulousness, credibility, dependability, and confirmability. Scientists are trained to be metic-ulous {{in the collection of}} scientific data and to present their findings in an objective and truthful manner— usually in the form of describing the methods used and the results obtained. The peer review and editing processes, as extensions of the scientific process, should be equally meticulous as they represent an additional check on the validity of a scientific work.

40|$|This paper assesses how Italian {{companies}} have implemented the regulation on {{related party transactions}} enacted by Consob in 2010. Companies have been given some degree of freedom in devising their internal codes: they may “opt-up” or “opt-down” {{from some of the}} default provisions set forth in the regulation, thus tailoring internal codes to their own individual needs. We investigate how firms have made use of these options, building an ad hoc firm-specific indicator which focuses on five key provisions. We find that the options we focus on have been taken advantage of in a variety of ways. We also verify the hypothesis that firms adopt stricter/looser procedures depending on corporate governance characteristics. While non-controlled firms seem to have set up <b>stricter</b> <b>procedures,</b> among controlled-companies those where a single shareholder or a coalition holds a stake lower than 50 % of voting and cash flow rights have weaker procedures. Finally, while a higher presence of independent directors does not seem to play a role, the presence of a director nominated by institutional investors is positively correlated with <b>stricter</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R
30|$|After the {{interview}} analysis quotes were categorised. All teachers considered the module {{to be useful}} and were willing to use the teaching design again in the second test phase. One teacher however, demanded a less <b>strict</b> <b>procedure</b> for working with the module, as she thought some parts in the teaching design were too easy for her students {{and she wanted to}} be able to skip tasks to speed up the teaching process. Another teacher disagreed with the statement that a good pronunciation increases the credibility of the speaker. He was only interested in the module because of the intelligibility aspect. Almost all the teachers wanted to have the ability to evaluate their own students and missed test materials and repetition tasks in the module.|$|E

Researchers and scientists {{all around the world}} work in laboratories with small devices and cheap equipment, and as a result the biodiesel produced is outside specifications. Many scientists use the same methods to characterize pure biodiesel properties in the case of fossil diesels, without referring to the new methods being developed referred in the technical regulations EN 14214 or ASTM 6751 - 02. Researchers are devising new methods and technologies to produce second and third generation biodiesel...|$|E
40|$|Geomagnetic {{field is}} vector sum of causes {{deep in the}} Earth's {{interior}} and their influence can be felt in the whole Earth. There are sources of magnetic Holds which are characterized for larger regions and local anomalous geomagnetic fields. When selecting the location of base station, regions where local geomagnetic anomalies are present, should be avoided, with aim to receive measured results which gives the geomagnetic field characteristic for that region. The territory of the Republic of Macedonia has complex relief, and also has complex geological structure and these features have high influence on the regional geomagnetic field. Bearing in mind the complex relief and geological structure, <b>strict</b> <b>procedure</b> of geomagnetic field observations were conducted for every selected location for repeat station.

The core methods for {{pattern recognition}} have been developed by machine learning experts but due to their broad success, an increasing number of non-experts are now employing and refining them. In this perspective, I will discuss the challenge of correct validation of supervised pattern recognition systems, in particular when employed by nonexperts. To illustrate the problem, I will give three examples of common errors that I have encountered in the last year. Much of this challenge can be addressed by <b>strict</b> <b>procedure</b> in validation but there are remaining problems of correctly interpreting comparative work on exemplary data sets, which I will elucidate on the example of the well-used MNIST data set of handwritten digits...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify the code of conducts and the {{reaction}} to the violation of the rules at secondary schools in Australia. Followings are the attitude of the State Government, schools, and parents toward the matter. First, State Government has a great influence on schools. The government sets the guidelines for the code of conducts. Second, schools try to make efforts to maintain well-ordered learning circumstances, setting their own strict school rules which are based on the state uidelines. And they have “zero-tolerance” like <b>strict</b> <b>procedure</b> against breaking school rules. Lastly, parents are required to cooperate with schools. But before being requested, they tend to solve their children’s problems independently. There are big differences between Japan and Australia in terms of this matter. The differences seem to be derived from the social structure, history, and cultural background...|$|E
30|$|Construct {{validity}} identifies {{operational measures}} for the concepts under study. To enhance construct validity (1) key informants should review draft case study reports, (2) multiple sources of evidence should be used, and (3) {{a chain of}} evidence should be established. We addressed all three: (1) For each interview summaries were drafted, including a FLOW model, and interviewee(s) were able to comment on them, (2) within some teams, but certainly not all, interviews were held {{with more than one}} interviewee so in those cases viewpoints could be complemented, and (3) we followed a <b>strict</b> <b>procedure</b> in proceeding from an interview protocol, via a FLOW model and its artefact descriptions, to the list of artefacts. Nevertheless, teams were not visited by the same members of the research group, so interpretation may have influenced especially the construction of FLOW models. Also, when only one interviewee was involved, personal opinions may have influenced our results.|$|E
30|$|Nonprobability {{methods of}} {{convenience}} and snowball sampling were utilized, which are appropriate when social sensitivities pose serious problems for locating and contacting potential respondents (Singleton et al. 1993). In recent years, <b>strict</b> <b>procedures</b> for handling personal information {{have become the}} norm in Japanese organizations, which have exacerbated the longstanding reluctance to cooperate with unsolicited research conducted by outsiders noted by Ogasawara (1998).
