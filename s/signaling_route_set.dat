40|$|While {{automation}} of <b>signal</b> and <b>route</b> <b>setting</b> is routine, {{the use of}} automation or {{decision support}} in disruption management processes is far less common. Such support offers significant advantages in optimising re-planning of both timetable and resources (crew and rolling stock), and has value in offering a 'shared view' of re-planning across the many actors manage disruption. If this vision is to be realised, however, disruption management decision support and automation must adhere to proven principles for effective human-agent cooperation. This paper synthesises data from a programme of work to understand user requirements for automated disruption support tools. It then compares these outputs with two frameworks for human-centred automation - one general (Klein et al's [2004] ten challenges for automation) and one transport specific (Balfe et al’s [2012] principles for transport automation). Emergent design requirements include the need for iterative modification of rescheduling parameters throughout a disruption, visibility of the reasoning behind options, accountability remaining {{in the hands of}} disruption controllers, and the need for the automated disruption support tools to take a multi-dimensional view of disruption that varies depending on the event encountered. The paper reflects on the practical utility of high-level design principles for automated disruption support tools...|$|R

Based on features of large-scale network and railway passenger transportation organization, the paper firstly innovatively puts forward the generation method of alternative <b>route</b> <b>set</b> in multiple constraint conditions. K short routes is proposed based on layering network to generate the alternative <b>route</b> <b>set</b> of passenger flow and hybrid genetic algorithm to generate the alternative <b>route</b> <b>set</b> of passenger flow in format of origin-destination matrix in order to overcome the shortage of traditional Dijkstra algorithm. Then reasonable routes of passenger flow are selected from the alternative <b>route</b> <b>set.</b> Finally, the algorithm by MATLAB programming can search reasonable <b>route</b> <b>set</b> of 589 passenger flows within 2 minutes in the railway network constituted by 521 stations which verifies the convergence of the algorithm...|$|R

40|$|A boundedly {{rational}} user equilibrium {{model with}} restricted unused routes (R-BRUE) considering the restrictions of both used route cost and unused route cost is proposed. The proposed model hypothesizes that for each OD pair no traveler can reduce his/her travel time by an indifference band by unilaterally changing route. Meanwhile, no route is unutilized if its travel time {{is lower than}} sum of indifference band and the shortest route cost. The largest and smallest used <b>route</b> <b>sets</b> are defined using mathematical expression. We also show that, {{with the increase of}} the indifference band, the largest and smallest used <b>route</b> <b>sets</b> will be augmented, and the critical values of indifference band to augment these two path sets are identified by solving the mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints. Based on the largest and smallest used <b>route</b> <b>sets,</b> the R-BRUE <b>route</b> <b>set</b> without paradoxical <b>route</b> is generated.

40|$|In current practice, {{there are}} two main {{concepts}} to handle the <b>route</b> <b>set</b> in an equilibrium route choice model. The first one is to maintain a fixed <b>route</b> <b>set</b> throughout the iterations for each OD pair. The second one is to determine the <b>route</b> <b>set</b> during the execution (every iteration or less), depending on the current congestion levels. They both have some problems. With a fixed <b>route</b> <b>set,</b> there is a change that an important route is not considered. While having a flexible <b>route</b> <b>set</b> over the iterations may negatively affect the convergence, Recursive Logit could resolve these issues as it is an implicit route choice model that considers all routes. It calculates the turning percentages from each node to each destination separately. From these percentages, destination-based flows can easily be calculated (in a static assignment). This paper first illustrates how recursive logit converges very stably to static equilibrium. The main contribution of this paper is the finding of a method to implement a full route choice with recursive logit in a dynamic assignment. Another contribution is suggestion a few important parameters that determine the utility for a traveller. Other parameters can easily be added. Finally, the relation between these parameters and finding a solution is formulated. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{operation}} of railway traffic {{from a single}} dispatching control centre ensures high quality of traffic management. Even better traffic control could be achieved through the automation of the dispatchers’ routine work. It saves dispatchers´ time which he can be devoted to solving conflicts caused by delayed trains. The process of planning the traffic and the execution of this plan are two independent activities which {{have to be done}} simultaneously. The dispatcher of the remote controlled lines has not just to optimize the railway traffic, he has to care for the properly train <b>route</b> <b>setting</b> as well. The new system of automatic train <b>route</b> <b>setting</b> should help him by doing much work on above mentioned activities for him. System that fulfils these requirements is automatic train <b>route</b> <b>setting</b> system. System or train dispatcher just decides how to handle the conflict situation and the function of automatic train <b>route</b> <b>setting</b> will execute the command at the proper time. This trend can be also seen in other countries. Very helpful for dispatchers who control the railway traffic is the graphic timetable. There is a common used application called GTN on Czech railways which is supplied together with the electronic interlocking from the AZD Praha. This application shows the actual and expected graphic timetable in the most appropriate form for dispatcher and moreover provides many other support functions. New designed function of the graphic train route editor enables precising the predicted timetable and consequently gaining the most probable prediction in the next moments. Given that GTN knows the actual timetable, dispose of data of trains and knows the exact train location in real time, the GTN is nowadays a powerful tool for decision support for traffic control staff. Therefore, GTN {{is an essential part of}} the system of automatic train <b>route</b> <b>setting</b> which is now being developed. Using the existing electronic interlocking, their remote control and the GTN application seems to be the easiest way how to implement automatic train <b>route</b> <b>setting</b> system on the infrastructure of the Czech railways...|$|R

40|$|In {{multicellular}} organisms {{control over}} organ {{size and shape}} is of utter importance. However, the regulation of control is rather complex. An involved <b>signalling</b> <b>route</b> is the Hippo pathway. In this review, the core cascade and downstream target of the Hippo pathway will be discussed. The first components of the pathway, Warts, Salvador, Hippo and Mats, were discovered {{in a search for}} tumour suppressors in the fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster). The downstream target is the transcription co-activator Yorkie (YKI), which targets many genes implicated in proliferation and apoptosis. These processes are involved in growth control. Deregulation can, therefore, result in severe effects, such as tumourigenesis. Furthermore, the upstream regulators of the Hippo pathway will be disclosed. Various factors are shown to regulate the Hippo pathway core kinases and/or Yorkie. The vastness of the upstream regulators is required for tissue, timing and organism specificity. In order for the Hippo pathway to affect the overall tissue, communication between cells is necessary. Therefore, cell-cell interactions are required to tightly control and modulate Hippo activity between neighbouring cells. Cross talk between the Hippo pathway and other mechanisms is necessary to coordinate the complex development and homeostasis of tissue size, shape and patterning. Taken together, the Hippo pathway is important for processes, such as proliferation and apoptosis. Even though, the regulation of the pathway is understood more and more, research is required to elucidate the <b>signalling</b> <b>route</b> even further. Since deregulation of the pathway can result in tumour formations, better understanding of the pathway could help better understand tumour development and progression. Moreover, insights in the <b>signalling</b> <b>route</b> might help develop therapeutic targets for cancer and other diseases...|$|R
