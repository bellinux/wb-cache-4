60|$|<b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he[26] {{is looking}} 'less young than formerly,' and that 'we should all learn {{to hear and}} make such remarks with equanimity.' Now, once for all, let me tell you--confess to you--I never, if I live to be a hundred, should learn that learning. Death has the {{luminous}} side when {{we know how to}} look; but the rust of time, the touch of age, is hideous and revolting to me, and I never see it, by even a line's breadth, in the face of any I love, without pain and recoil of nature. I have a worse than womanly weakness about that class of subjects. Death is a face-to-face intimacy; age, a thickening of the mortal mask between souls. So I hate it; put it far from me. Why talk of age, when it's just an appearance, an accident, when we are all young in soul and heart? We don't say, one to another, 'You are freckled in the forehead to-day,' or 'There's a yellow shade in your complexion.' Leave those disagreeable trifles. I, for my part, never felt younger. Did you, I wonder? To be sure not. Also, I have a gift in my eyes, I think, for scarcely ever does it strike me that anybody is altered, except my child, for instance, who certainly is larger than when he was born. When I went to England after five years' absence, everybody (save one) appeared to me younger than I was used to conceive of them, and of course I took for granted that I appeared to them in the same light. Be sure that it is highly moral to be young as long as possible. Women who throw up the game early (or even late) and wear dresses 'suitable to their years' (that is, as hideous as possible), are a disgrace to their sex, aren't they now? And women and men with statistical memories, who are always quoting centuries and the years thereof ('Do you remember in '20?' As if anybody could), are the pests of society. And, in short, and for my part, whatever honours of authorship may ever befall me, I hope I may be safe from the epithet which distinguishes the Venerable Bede.|$|E

And has she forgotten me, never read 'Aurora Leigh,' never heard of me or from me that, before 'Spiritualism' came up in America, I have been called orthodox by infidels, and heterodox by church-people; and gone on predicting to such persons as came near enough to me in speculative liberty of opinion to justify my speaking, that the present churches were in course of dissolution, {{and would have to}} be followed by a reconstruction of Christian essential verity into other than these middle-age scholastic forms. Believing in Christ's divinity, which is the life of Christianity, I believed this. Otherwise, if the end were here--if we were to be covered over and tucked in with the Thirty-nine Articles or the like, and good-night to us for a sound sleep in 'sound doctrine'--I should fear for a revealed religion incapable of expansion according to the needs of man. What comes from God has life in it, and certainly from all the growth of living things, spiritual growth cannot be excepted. But I shun religious controversy--it is useless. I never 'disturb anybody's mind,' as it is called--let those sleep who can. If I had not known that your mind was broken up rather broadly by truths out of Swedenborg, I should not have mooted the subject, be sure. (Have you given up Swedenborg? this by the way.) Having done so, I am anxious to set you right about Mrs. Stowe. As the author of the most successful book printed by man or woman, perhaps I a little under-rated her. The book has genius, but did not strike me as it did some other readers. Her 'Sunny Memories,' I liked very little. When she came to us in Florence some years ago, I did not think I should like her, nor did Robert, but we were both of us surprised and charmed with her simplicity and earnestness. At Rome last year she brought her inner nature more in contact with mine, and I, who had looked for what one usually finds in women, was startled into much admiration and sympathy by finding in her a largeness and fearlessness of thought which, coming out of a clerical and puritan cul-de-sac, and combined with the most devout and reverent emotions, really is fine. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> since 'Uncle Tom' she has turned infidel, because of her interest in Spiritualism. Her last words to me when we parted, were, 'Those who love the Lord Jesus Christ never see one another for the last time.' That's the attitude of the mind which you stigmatise as corrupting.|$|E

5000|$|In the mid-2000s, Schnabel {{wanted to}} direct a film version of the novel Perfume by Patrick SÃ¼skind. Schnabel wrote a highly {{detailed}} script himself in which it had a stream of consciousness-driven narrative. Schnabel said that he wanted his film be more about the interior desire of the storyâs protagonist Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, âthe notion wasn't to make the guy more like you or me but to make him different, the way he was. And we had to reorganize our chromosomes, our moral chromosomes, so we could see that orgy is happening, instead being shocked by seeing this, you sit and you're thinking, [...] "Hey, I wanna sit through this and watch because I wanna see if that perfume works!" [...] And so, I had written a script and I thought that this man could smell {{all the way to}} Alaska or Egyptâ. [...] "I wanted to make Perfume because I thought it was about somebody who created something that was so beautiful that he couldn't share it with anybody, because they fell under the spell of it and they lost their critical faculties. So they never knew, and he couldn't share his accomplishment with anybody. It drove him nuts", said Schnabel. Schnabel also described certain scenes in his script. âit starts with him Grenouille climbing up this mountain and than he eats a salamander while he's climbing up this rocky crag and at first you think, [...] "That's a little weird that he did that". And than he jumps up in the sky he throws his arms in the air and than he crawls into this hole. And than, the camera pushes into his head and you start to see inside his head like he's dreaming, you start to go in, or you think a story is going to be told to you and as we push in we see him sitting in some fancy clothes and as he takes a drink from one of these glasses, it has a date on it and it takes you back to this place (sometime in the 18th century), Paris. <b>So,</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the narrator is this man, who is drinking from those glasses. And if you haven't read the book, you think he must have been a rich guy at one time and then he must of had some trouble and he's telling us a story. That's viable and reasonable interpretation of what you'r seeing. And you watch the movie, and about an hour into the movie, Grenouille climbs back on that mountain and gets into the cave and narrator starts to say that he slept for 7 years and he would have stayed there probably {{for the rest of his}} life except the fabric of his dream starts to fall apart and he realizes that his scent was a scent afar and that terrified him and as you watch you see the guy who's the narrator starting to crawl up on top on a couch in this library with all the bottles there and everything is turning into, first mist and than the room is starting to disappear and so is he's starting to disappear. And you realize that the narrator was a dream at that point and the guy screams and you see this hole and you see the landscape and the next thing you see is just a P.O.V. that's running down a hill until finally the sky arrives at somewhere where people from their villages start running away from him. And the next thing you see is a sack over the head of the camera and a 'clunk' and you hear somebody saying, [...] "His journeyman's papers". And the next thing you see is Christopher Walken standing in front saying, [...] "Okay, let's look at him." [...] And they take the sack cloth off his head and you see a guy with a long beard, talons for fingernails and then your story begins and so what you wouldn't know is that the narrator was a dream and in the process of doing that I had written the scene where you see Egypt, you see Alaska.â Bernd Eichinger, who owned the rights to the novel at the time, disliked Schnabel's script and two had a series of disputes over the project. Schnabelâs version was Perfume was never made but Schnabel did eventually transferred his unique approach of his ââPerfumeââ script into his 2007 film, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.|$|E
40|$|Growing {{flowers for}} seed Cue: While the growing of flowers has {{expanded}} {{in certain parts}} of Africa in recent years, as a result of improved storage facilities and air links with European markets, it remains a minority farming activity. For small scale farmers, flower growing may only be possible if they have an agreement with a commercial company, who can provide the necessary seed and inputs, as well as a guaranteed market. For those who grow cut flowers, attention to detail is essential - if the flowers are to reach the customer looking their best, not only must they be expertly grown, but harvesting, packaging and transport must be done according to a very precise schedule. There is, however, another way to earn money from flowers, where the crop is not the flower itself, but the seed it produces. Selling flower seed is a big global business, and in some parts of Africa, farmers are benefiting from the profits to be made. Moses Kilusu, who lives near Arusha in northern Tanzania, is one such farmer. He spoke to Lazarus Laiser about his production of flower seeds. IN:		?Kisarian is a village situated? OUT:		? I am sure I will finish my house. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 45 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Moses Kilusu, who grows flowers for seed production in northern Tanzania. Transcript Laiser	Kisarian is a village situated in Arusha region just ten kilometres from Arusha. And I am standing with a farmer called Moses Kilusu who is living here in Kisarian and he has something to tell us about farming especially the high value crops that he is growing here in Kisarian. Kilusu	(Vernac) The crop we depend on much as commercial crop is beans, but we have another one which is flowers. We started growing it when we discovered that it earns a lot of money. We get the seeds from Multiflower company Ltd. The type of flower we grow here in Kisarian are much productive which are hypomea, zinia, cosmo and targetta. But hypomea is the best and we grow mostly here because it can cope with our climate and soil type. Laiser		Was it difficult to develop a market for the crop? Kilusu	(Vernac) We have the company, they give us seeds free of charge with a condition of selling the seeds to them. So we have not got any problems of market but transport is upon us. Usually we are paid after three months. Laiser		Why did you decide to grow this crop? Kilusu	(Vernac) I left the other crops because their profit is very little. As you know that we get very little rain here. Crops like maize, beans, needs a lot of rain and yields are very few or poor. But these type of flowers only needs a little rain, it only receives rain three times and then you can get a ready yield. Laiser		Mr Moses what are the difficult aspects of growing this crop? Kilusu	(Vernac) There are difficulties. First you need to prepare your land or farm by digging it and once the rain has started you plant it. And after two weeks you need to weed it and spray to kill insects. Another difficulty is during the harvest. It is very difficult because you have to cut using a sharp knife and after that you have to collect them together and pound them in order to get off the husks. This process is the hardest one. Laiser	What are the necessary conditions for the cultivation of crop to be a success? Kilusu	(Vernac) What is important to consider carefully before we plant is the climate. Immediately the first rain you have to plant the seeds and the second rains you have to start weeding. Because once you delay in weeding they will not produce. The rain needed is only three times and this can be enough for harvest. We have this kind of rain in Kisarian. Laiser		<b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this crop is good to grow here in Kisarian? Kilusu	(Vernac) It can fit very well here in Kisarian and the proof is that we have got a lot of profit from this crop. From one acre you can get 120 - 200 kilograms. If I sell them I can get six thousand Tanzanian shillings. This is a big amount of money compared to maize sales. From this farming, when I started other people are afraid of the big work that you need to do. But when they saw our success they have now joined us and they are happy with the profit they are getting. And I believe that others will continue to join. Laiser		Mr Moses what are your future plans? Kilusu	(Vernac) To rent land, to have more acres and expand the plantation of this crop to get many kilograms, and I will get a profit and I am sure I will finish my house.

40|$|Jatropha oil ? an {{alternative}} to kerosene Cue: Every evening, millions of families across the world light up kerosene lanterns, especially in rural areas not connected to a national electricity grid. In some countries, kerosene is also widely used as a cooking fuel, and may be subsidised by governments, to reduce dependence on firewood. But in Tanzania, a locally produced alternative to kerosene is gaining in popularity. Jatropha oil is produced from {{the seeds of the}} jatropha tree, a plant found in regions close to the equator, which can grow up to 6 metres in height. Jatropha Products Tanzania Limited is a non-profit organisation which is promoting the use of jatropha oil in the country. Farmers, for example, are being trained in how to extract the oil and use it to meet some of their energy needs. Albert Mshanga explained more to Lazarus Laiser, about how the oil can be used. IN:	?Jatropha oil, essentially, can be used ? OUT:	? energy at our household level. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 30 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Albert Mshanga of Jatropha Products Tanzania Limited. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mshanga	Jatropha oil, essentially, can be used in different ways. It can be used to light a small lantern like the jatropha lamps that we have in front of us here. Also it {{can be used in a}} small stove which has been modified to use plant oil. Jatropha oil can also be transformed into biodiesel and used in cars which use diesel oil. Laiser	Now Mr Albert, focusing on the small lantern which is just before us, will you just describe how it is made? Mshanga	This small lantern is made up of a recycled coffee tin. The coffee tins have been thrown away after the coffee inside has been used. Also we have a glass on top of it which is put there to radiate the light, to increase the illumination of the lamp. And we have the wires which are used for making handles and a frame for the glass. The fabrication of this lantern is quite simple. It is just a coffee tin, wire, and a glass and a copper tube at the middle of the lantern. The copper tube is used as an area where you fix or you put your wick, and the copper tube is used to warm the oil around it, so it makes the oil thinner so it can increase the capillarity of the oil. Laiser	So the tube which is going down there, you say that it helps to heat the oil to make it thinner? Mshanga	It is true that the copper tubes go inside the oil in the tin. The copper tube is used because it transmits heat inside, and plant oil is thicker than kerosene, so you have to warm it so that you reduce the viscosity of it, and hence you increase the capillarity of the oil. Laiser	<b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this lantern is more cheaper to use than the kerosene lantern? Mshanga	Yes, the lantern is cheaper compared to the kerosene lantern. We did a study on the use of the jatropha oil and the kerosene in the same type of lamp. In jatropha oil, the amount of oil that was consumed in a month was only a litre, but for the kerosene we found that in a month it used three or four litres. And in lighting the lamp, the amount of oil that is used in ten hours, we did a study and found that for the jatropha, only 50 cc went out, while for the kerosene lamp, 180 - 220 cc of kerosene was used in the same period. So economically, this jatropha lamp seems to be more economical compared to the kerosene lamp. Laiser	What also if you compare the smoke which is coming out after burning the oil? Mshanga	As you can see here, the jatropha lantern does not produce smoke. There is smoke but the smoke is very small, you can?t even see it or you can?t detect it. Laiser	I just want to test it. I have a paper with me. Then I would like to test if it has smoke. Ah yes, I have my paper just close to the lantern, on top of the glass, and, how long was it? But not yet, I cannot see any smoke. So compared to kerosene, yes, it is wonderful. What else would you like to tell the listener, about the price of this lantern? How much is it sold for? Mshanga	Currently the price of this small jatropha lantern is 3, 500 Tanzanian shillings. But we do encourage in areas where we promote the production of jatropha, we do encourage farmers to produce oil and various other products on their own. So essentially what we do at JPTL, we teach the farmers how to process the oil and also we teach youth in those areas how to fabricate the lamp. So you will find that, even if you see now the prices are 3, 500, but farmers can be taught how to fabricate the lamp, and they can fabricate the lamps for themselves and also sell to other householders within the community. And also, by teaching them how to fabricate the lamps, we create some sort of employment to the youth, and we do also conserve the environment by recycling the tins. The other thing is you can produce your energy at a household level. Instead of travelling long distance in search of oil; you know that a lot of villages in our country, the infrastructure is quite poor. Carrying kerosene from town to villages, the price goes higher compared to the oil which can be produced at local level, at household level. And you can have your energy for cooking, for lighting, at your vicinity, instead of going outside and depending on oil from outside, we can have energy at our household level.

40|$|Cue: Is Africa?s climate changing? Is it {{becoming}} hotter and drier as {{a result}} of global warming? For many years scientists have been uncertain about exactly what climate change will mean for Africa, and this may be one reason why many governments have been slow to respond to the threat. However, in recent years one feature of our changing weather patterns has become more clear - extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods are becoming more common. Could this greater certainty about how our climate is changing lead to a more active response from governments and individuals? One person who thinks it might is Declan Conway, a climate expert who has spent the last ten years studying weather patterns in Africa. He recently spoke to Mike Davison about how he thinks attitudes towards climate change could themselves be changing. IN:		?In the past what we? OUT:		?climate change in the future. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 39 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Declan Conway, a climate expert based at the University of East Anglia in the UK. Transcript Conway	In the past what we tended to look at were emissions of greenhouse gases, which are causing the problems of climate change. So carbon dioxide, burning of trees, burning of fossil fuels, oil, gas and so on. But gradually as people have begun to realise that we are now committed to a certain amount of climate change, however much we change the present day emissions of greenhouse gases, we therefore need to think about adaptation. How is it that we can deal with these. How can individuals improve their capacity to manage extremes and variability, and what can the government do about intervening in those sort of events. Davison	And what kind of things would you be recommending, say in response to floods? Conway	Well for floods, for example, we know that often we get a chance to forecast that a flood is going to occur. As conditions get gradually wetter and wetter, and the land begins to become saturated, we can say that there may well be a flood event in the next few days, and some people may be exposed to lake-side flooding, or the river bursting its banks, and either their fields being affected, or their homes, or their animals being affected by that. So if we can improve the ability to be able to warn people about those kinds of events, then {{that would be a good}} first step. Davison	And imagine that you are able to warn people, crop farmers, livestock farmers; what can they do if they know a flood is coming? Conway	Well some of the things that could be done for example; a lot of flood events are caused by very heavy rainfall. Now if that occurs during the harvest season, farmers could be told or suggested that they harvest their crops early, before the rain comes. Or people who live in flood plains, areas that are likely to be flooded by rivers, could be warned about the hazard, so that they can then move temporarily out of the way, or move their animals. Davison	So it is actually very useful and practical information to know when a flood is coming? Conway	That?s right, it is. Davison	In terms of the future, do you think that there are things that are going to be happening over the next ten years, say, that are going to make it easier for people to respond to climate change? Conway	I think gradually as governments, as institutions and as people get more used to the idea that climate is actually less reliable than it used to be in the past - so of course, for most of the last century we have accepted that the climate doesn?t really change very much from year to year. But now when you speak to people, farmers, managers of reservoirs, dams and so on, we are beginning to see that more and more people are saying, ?Well, things seem to be a little bit different to us?. And I think that as that realisation becomes more accepted, then governments, people can begin to plan for more variability in the future, and that is very likely the thing that climate change is going to bring in the future, and that is less certainty about when the rains may come, how long the rains may last, or whether there may be any breaks in the rain, that kind of information. Davison	<b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the forecasting, the predicting of when a rainy season is likely to start, could actually be the kind of information that could be spread to farmers, to help them with making decisions about what to grow and, when to grow it? Conway	That?s right, there certainly is a lot of interest in this area; the ability to use seasonal forecasting information. So that is like the weather forecasts we hear on the news about what is going to happen today or tomorrow, what the temperatures will be, whether it is going to rain. We are now developing an ability to be able to say, over the next two or three months, we are likely to see a very wet rainy season, so more rain than usual, or perhaps the rainy season may be quite dry. And that information, given the ability of farmers to be able to adapt to or act on that information, may actually be quite useful. It could also be useful for reservoir management; so how much water do we release from the reservoir this week, next week and so on, in the light of the seasonal forecast. So it is still in the early phase of development, but it is potentially a good strategy for dealing with climate change in the future. End of track.

6000|$|... "Forrest," [...] he said abruptly, [...] "it is {{a mistake}} to clear out all the {{servants}} like this. Not only have we had to eat a filthy dinner, but it's enough to make people suspicious, eh? Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> afterwards <b>that</b> they may wonder why we did it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; of course. If {{there had}} been no other man, why not <b>you?</b> Am I <b>so</b> hard, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I can love no one? Are you not such a one that a girl would {{naturally}} love,--were she not preoccupied? That a woman should love seems as necessary as that a man should not." ...|$|R

But we all agreed that you must be {{preserved}} for our country. Of that we have no doubt whatever--I mean all of us who have heard Haldin speak of you on certain occasions. A man doesn't get the police ransacking his rooms without there being some devilry hanging over his head.... And <b>so</b> if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{it would be better for}} you to bolt at once...." ...|$|R

Al Mubarak's position as ruler of Kuwait means that I am the true ruler of Kuwait. So {{there is no difference}} between myself and them, for they are like the dearest of my children and you are aware of this. Had someone else come to me with this offer, I would have complained about them to <b>you.</b> <b>So</b> how do <b>you</b> come to me with this offer when you are well aware that myself and Al Mubarak are one soul and one house, what affects them affects me, whether good or evil." ...|$|R

If it were not <b>so,</b> do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> all my family as well as yours would join in wishing that you may become my wife? There is nothing to conceal. When you married that man you know what my mother thought of it; and what John thought of it, and his wife. They had wanted you to be my wife; {{and they want it}} now,--because they are anxious for my happiness. And your father wishes it, and your brother wishes it,--because they trust me, and <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I should be a good husband to you." ...|$|R

But seriously now, Harold, you would hurt {{me if it}} were not <b>so</b> absurd.

"Mr Dale, {{you have}} no right to say such things to me, and you are very unjust in doing <b>so.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I have set my girls against you, it will be much better that we should leave Allington altogether. I have been placed in {{circumstances}} which have made it difficult for me to do my duty to my children; but I have endeavoured to do it, not regarding my own personal wishes. I am quite sure, however, that it would be wrong in me to keep them here, if I am to be told by you that I have taught them to regard you unfavourably. Indeed, I cannot suffer such a thing to be said to me." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{seems like}} another rather odd way to {{introduce}} a chapter {{that is supposed to}} be about historicising legal theory, whatever that is. Yet it is precisely everything about this chapter and its place in this book. OK, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> might <b>think</b> <b>that</b> history {{has something to do with}} legal theory and that that is something completely different. <b>You</b> might <b>think</b> <b>that</b> legal theory is completely different from law - if so, we clearly have some way to go in this book. In this chapter we invite you to experience a very different way into thinking legally, immersing you into the known and the unknown, in order to find out how much our non-legal worlds - our NLDBs - affect legal interpretation and legal thinking. And that is something completely different from anything you would possibly expect from a book about legal theory, even an extravert one like this...|$|R

I am endeavouring to do my duty by explaining to you the advantages which you would enjoy by going to your Aunt Emmeline, and which you certainly cannot have if you remain here. And I must tell you, that, if you return to Sir Thomas, he will probably provide for you. You know what I mean by providing for you?" ...|$|R

Macumazahn, she is done with, or <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> though <b>that</b> is {{a strange}} saying for a white man who {{believes}} in much {{that we do not}} know; but at least her work remains, and it has been a great work. Consider now. Umbelazi and most of the princes, and thousands upon thousands of the Zulus, whom I, the Dwande, hate, dead, dead! Mameena's work, Macumazahn! Panda's hand grown strengthless with sorrow and his eyes blind with tears. Mameena's work, Macumazahn! Cetewayo, king in all but name; Cetewayo, who shall bring the House of Senzangakona to the dust. Mameena's work, Macumazahn! Oh! a mighty work. Surely she has lived a great and worthy life, and she died a great and worthy death! And how well she did it! Had you eyes to see her take the poison which I gave her--a good poison, was it not?--between her kisses, Macumazahn?" ...|$|R
