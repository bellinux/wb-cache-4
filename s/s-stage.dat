30|$|Growth of Baizhi {{has three}} stages: V-stage, {{vegetative}} stage; B-stage, bolting stage; and <b>S-stage,</b> summer dormancy stage. Summer dormancy in herbaceous perennials is characterized by: (1) cessation or reduction of leaf meristem growth; (2) senescence of {{most or all}} above-ground herbage; (3) possible dehydration of the bases of the youngest leaves {{at the base of}} vegetative tillers; and (4) possible preceding formation of resting organs in the form of swollen basal internodes (corm/tuber) or swollen leaf bases (such as bulbs) (Volaire and Norton 2006). Although a report indicated NtFTs are target genes of temperature signal pathway to regulate the dormancy process in Narcissus tazetta var Chinensis (Feng et al. 2015), the relationship between biochemical regular and summer dormancy still lacked conclusive researches (Gillespie and Volaire 2017). For environmental drivers, vegetative organs develop under increasing day-length and temperature at the end of spring will induce summer dormancy (Volaire et al. 2009). In addition, water deficit was shown to be an induction factor for P. bulbosa L. (Ofir and Kigel 2007) and D. glomerata (Volaire 2002). Accordingly, after the V-stage, instead of transitioning to the B-stage, Baizhi enters summer dormancy (<b>S-stage)</b> to survive hot and dry environmental conditions. Its above-ground portions die during summer, and its root becomes the storage organ and therefore becomes heavier, a mechanism that implies more harvest yield than at other growth stages. Thus, it is expected that Baizhi roots should be harvested at <b>S-stage,</b> although the <b>S-stage</b> is not necessary to complete the regular life cycle of Baizhi.|$|E

Our preliminary studies indicated that sowing earlier by 1  month (in November) may result in early bolting in May. Many studies have reported that stage-transition of Baizhi is determined by, for example, sowing date, fertilizing management and other environmental factors. In the near future, global warming is expected to affect phenological events such as flowering and fruiting in plants and will hasten development time in plant species that respond to cues such as degree days (Hughes 2000).

A linear iteration scheme is examined in this article. When applied to an <b>s-stage</b> Runge-Kutta method, each step of the iteration requires s function evaluations and the solution of s sets of linear equations. For the scalar differential equation x′ = qx, the convergence rate of the scheme depends on the spectral radius π[M(z) ] of the iteration matrix M, a function of z = hq where h is the steplength. A lower bound for π[M(z) ] is established and new schemes are obtained for the two-stage Gauss method by minimizing the supremum of this lower bound over regions of the complex plane. In one scheme the supremum on the negative real axis is minimized. The iteration scheme is generalized in order to obtain improved convergence rates. When applied to an <b>s-stage</b> Runge-Kutta method, each step of this new scheme still requires just s function evaluations.
