5|$|Leaving Puerto Escondido, they {{continued}} {{up the coast}} to Loreto, where they restocked their supplies. They then visited the Coronado Islands, Concepcíon Bay and San Lucas Cove, collecting specimens at each stop. The work was exhausting; Steinbeck wrote in his letters that he had little time for sleep because the collecting and preparation took so long. In the cramped quarters of the boat, all the equipment had to be <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> stowed each time the boat {{moved to a new}} anchorage, which made the work of cataloguing and processing the specimens doubly arduous.|$|E
5|$|No {{additional}} SPUs {{were set}} up in 1992, regardless of discrepancies between the November 1991 reorganisation scheme and the actual order of battle of the special police. Two additional SPUs were <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> assigned to the Koprivnica-Križevci and Požega-Slavonia police administrations in 1993. Following a reorganisation of the force carried out in 2001, the regionally based units were amalgamated into four units—Zagreb, Split, Rijeka and Osijek. At the same time, the special police was reduced to 300 personnel.|$|E

5|$|Participants {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the crew may help the GMs to <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> maintain {{the environment of the}} LARP during play by acting as stagehands or playing non-player characters (NPCs) who fill out the setting. Crew typically receive more information about the setting and more direction from the GMs than players do. In a tabletop role-playing game, a GM usually plays all the NPCs, whereas in a LARP, each NPC is typically played by a separate crew member. Sometimes players are asked to play NPCs for periods of an event.|$|E

5|$|Alexander III's {{unexpected}} {{death in}} a riding accident in 1286 precipitated a major succession crisis. Scottish leaders appealed to King Edward I of England for help in determining who was the rightful heir. Edward chose Alexander's three-year-old Norwegian granddaughter, Margaret. On her way to Scotland in 1290, however, Margaret died at sea, and Edward was again asked to adjudicate between 13 rival claimants to the throne. A court was <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{after two years of}} deliberation, it pronounced John Balliol to be king. However, Edward proceeded to treat Balliol as a vassal, and tried to exert influence over Scotland. In 1295, when Balliol renounced his allegiance to England, Edward I invaded. During the first ten years of the ensuing Wars of Scottish Independence, Scotland had no monarch, until Robert the Bruce declared himself king in 1306.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of a reserve {{battalion}} during World War I, Himmler did not see active service. He studied agronomy in college, and joined the Nazi Party in 1923 and the SS in 1925. In 1929, he was appointed Reichsführer-SS by Hitler. Over the next 16 years, he developed the SS from a mere 290-man battalion into a million-strong paramilitary group, and, following Hitler's orders, <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> controlled the Nazi concentration camps. He was known to have good organisational skills and for selecting highly competent subordinates, such as Reinhard Heydrich in 1931. From 1943 onwards, he was both Chief of German Police and Minister of the Interior, overseeing all internal and external police and security forces, including the Gestapo (Secret State Police). Himmler had a lifelong interest in occultism, interpreting Germanic neopagan and Völkisch beliefs to promote the racial policy of Nazi Germany, and incorporating esoteric symbolism and rituals into the SS.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} British law {{relating}} to marriage {{was based on}} the legal doctrine of coverture, in which a woman's legal rights and obligations were subsumed by those of her husband upon their matrimony. By law a woman had no separate legal existence, and all her property became her husband's; divorce initiated by a woman was difficult and complicated. In April 1868 Josephine and fellow suffragist Elizabeth Wolstenholme <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> became joint secretaries of the Married Women's Property Committee to pressure parliament into changing the law. Josephine remained on the committee until the campaign was successful, with the passing into law of the Married Women's Property Act 1882.|$|E
5|$|Collectively, {{amateur astronomers}} observe {{a variety of}} {{celestial}} objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, {{and a variety of}} deep-sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{team captain}} Bob Milne left the club with a legacy {{as one of}} Linfield's best ever players. He had amassed nine Irish Cups, eight league titles, and had earned 27 {{international}} caps for Ireland during his time at the club. Another Scot, Marshall McEwan, joined Linfield in 1911 {{at the age of}} 26. He had previously played for Blackpool, Bolton Wanderers and Chelsea. McEwan is perhaps best remembered for his performance in the 1913 Irish Cup final, described by some fans as the best in years. McEwan retired in 1916, but remained in Belfast and later opened several businesses. In 1915, the Irish League was suspended as a result of World War I. In its place, a temporary unofficial league known as the Belfast & District League was <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> ran for four seasons until the return of the Irish League in 1919. As this was an unofficial competition, any titles during this time are not counted as Irish League Championships. Linfield won this competition twice, in 1915–16 along with the Irish Cup, and in 1917–18.|$|E

5|$|Malvern Theatres, {{housed in}} the Winter Gardens complex in the town centre, is a provincial centre for the arts. The first Malvern Drama Festival, {{which took place in}} 1929, was {{dedicated}} to Bernard Shaw and planned by Sir Barry Jackson. A number of works have had their first performances at Malvern, six by Shaw including In Good King Charles's Golden Days, the 1929 English première of The Apple Cart, and the world première of Geneva in 1938. In 1956 Malvern held a Shaw centenary week. In February 1965 a Malvern Festival Theatre Trust was <b>set</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> extensive refurbishment was undertaken. J B Priestley presided over the opening ceremony of the first summer season. In 1998, a further £7.2 million major redesign and refurbishment took place with the help of contributions from the National Lottery Distribution Fund (NLDF), administered by the government Department for Culture, Media and Sport.|$|E
5|$|On {{the line}} {{farther to the}} south, North Korean T-34 tank fire hit E Company at midnight. First Lieutenant Charles Ellis, the company commander, {{attempted}} to rally his men but they crumbled under fire, retreating without orders. During the night everyone in E Company ran off the hill except Ellis and 11 men. Several E Company men fled through a mine field they had <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> were killed. North Korean fire pinned Ellis' men down after dawn on September 1. When {{three or four of}} the group tried to escape, North Korean machine gun fire killed them. Ellis and the remaining men stayed in their foxholes on the hill for two days, repelling several attacks in that time. Ellis was then able to withdraw south, up the mountain to the 3rd Battalion's position. In his withdrawal, Ellis, discovering {{a man who had been}} injured earlier in a mine explosion, entered the mine field to rescue him.|$|E
