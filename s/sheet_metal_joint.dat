40|$|This paper {{discussed}} {{about the}} consequences of using different filer metal by metal inert gas (MIG) welding process on aluminium alloys Al 7075 <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>joint.</b> Nowadays, Al 7075 is widely used in automobile and aviation industry due to its light weight, strong, and high hardness. Fusion welding, such as MIG and TIG were commonly used in joining the aluminium alloys due to its low cost. However, defects usually occurred using fusion welding because of the inaccurate welding parameters and types of filer metal used. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine whether the filer metal with different elements and welding parameters affect the mechanical properties of welded Al 7075. Welding parameters used were current, voltage, welding speed, and Argon (Ar) as shielding gas. Two different types of filer metal were used which is Electrode Rod (ER) 4043 and ER 5356 which is from Al-Si and Al-Mg based element, respectively. From microstructure analysis, fusion zone (FZ) of sample welded with ER 4043 has a smaller grain size than that of with ER 5356. Both filer produced equiaxed dendritic grain at FZ. Both samples welded with ER 4043 and ER 5356 has lower hardness value than heat affected zone (HAZ) and base metal(BM) due to the differences in their elements where ER 4043 from Al-Si and ER 5356 from Al-Mg group.

Joint material, bolt preload level, and the amplitude level of the cyclic bending moment are studied for their effect on the fatigue life of the clamped <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> plate. Bolt tightening to a precise preload level is accomplished by using an ultrasonic instrument that has been mechanically pre-calibrated to convert the time delay of longitudinal ultrasonic wave reflection to a bolt elongation and corresponding preload value. Fatigue data is generated using an MTS fatigue testing system. Experimental and FEA results are fitted into a multi-axial model for predicting the fatigue behavior of the bolted joint.

40|$|The {{aluminium}} alloys and adhesive currently employed in aircraft construction {{have been used}} to investigate, using a variety of experimental techniques, the fundamental characteristics of structural bonded aluminium joints, with particular emphasis on the boundary layer zone. The results of studies on the individual components of the joint are first described in order to assess the interdependent influence of each component in subsequent ageing tests of the entire bonded joint. Substantial knowledge is presented {{as a result of these}} investigations concerning the long-term durabiltiy of bonded aluminium joints, and two degradation mechanisms have been elucidated. These are: (1) an alkaline course of destruction caused by the influence of moisture on the aluminium oxide in epoxy resin systems; and (2) an acidic degradation which can only occur alongside electrochemical corrosion of the <b>metal.</b> For <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> to <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>joints</b> produced according to current regulations, only the acidic mechanism, so-called bondline corrosion, is of utmost technical importance. By explaining the factors influencing joint durability, fundamental adhesion principles are highlighted from which proposals for improvements are made and topics for future optimization research are suggested...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the effectiveness of}} using duct tape in sealing residential air distribution systems through two laboratory longevity tests. The first test involved the aging of common ?core-to-collar joints? of flexible duct to <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> collars, and <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> ?collar-to-plenum <b>joints?</b> exposed to continuous 200 ?F (93 ?C) circulating air. The second test consisted of baking duct tape specimens in a constant 212 ?F (100 ?C) oven following the UL 181 BFX ?Temperature Test? requirements. The study concluded that the duct tape performance in sealing joints depends on the joint's space dimensions; it gets worse {{as the number of}} dimensions required to describe the joint increases (1 -D to 3 -D). This is essentially caused by the shrinkage of the duct tape backing that results in the peeling of its rubber-based adhesive off the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> fixture. The baking test results showed that the failure in the duct tape joints could be attributed to the combination type of the duct tape and the material it is applied to...|$|R
40|$|Duct leakage {{has been}} {{identified}} as a major source of energy loss in residential buildings. Most duct leakage occurs at the connections to registers, plenums or branches in the duct system. At each of these connections a method of sealing the duct system is required. Typical sealing methods include tapes or mastics applied around the joints in the system. Field examinations of duct systems have typically shown that these seals tend to fail over extended periods of time. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has been testing sealant durability for several years. Typical duct tape (i. e. fabric backed tapes with natural rubber adhesives) was found to fail more rapidly than all other duct sealants. This report summarizes the results of duct sealant durability testing of five UL 181 B-FX listed duct tapes (three cloth tapes, a foil tape and an Oriented Polypropylene (OPP) tape). One of the cloth tapes was specifically developed in collaboration with a tape manufacturer to perform better in our durability testing. The first test involved the aging of common ''core-to-collar joints'' of flexible duct to <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> collars, and <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> ''collar-to-plenum joints'' pressurized with 200 F (93 C) air. The second test consisted of baking duct tape specimens in a constant 212 F (100 C) oven following the UL 181 B-FX ''Temperature Test'' requirements. Additional tests were also performed on only two tapes using <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> collar-to-plenum <b>joints.</b> Since an unsealed flexible duct joint can have a variable leakage depending on the positioning of the flexible duct core, the durability of the flexible duct joints could not be based on the 10 % of unsealed leakage criteria. Nevertheless, the leakage of the sealed specimens prior to testing could be considered as a basis for a failure criteria. Visual inspection was also documented throughout the tests. The flexible duct core-to-collar joints were inspected monthly, while the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> collar-to-plenum <b>joints</b> were inspected weekly. The baking test specimens were visually inspected weekly, and the durability was judged by the observed deterioration in terms of brittleness, cracking, flaking and blistering (the terminology used in the UL 181 B-FX test procedure) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSolid bonding based {{processes}} {{represent an}} effective solution {{in terms of}} both joints mechanical performances and sustainability. In the last years, both the academic and the industrial researchers focused their work on two solid-state processes: Friction Stir Welding (FSW) and Linear Friction Welding (LFW). The former, patented in 1991 by TWI, is used to weld <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> in different <b>joint</b> morphologies, i. e. butt, lap T and 3 D joints. The latter has been known for several years, but a growing interest is observed in the last years due to the enhancement of the welding machines performances. LFW, used to join bulk components, is particularly suited for aeronautical and aerospace applications. In this paper, the potential of the two processes is investigated analysing the joints properties and the metallurgical modifications induced by the processes as related to the welded alloy. For both the processes, the effect of the main process variables is highlighted and the impact on industrial production is pointed out...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{numerical}} calculation of stresses in structures with {{a multitude of}} spot joints {{continues to be a}} challenge, especially if local stresses are located in the area of joining positions or if crack endangerment needs to be addressed. In addition to inadequate FE modelling, a major cause for this is the unavailability of exact primary data, which describe the properties of the joints. New methods for determining the stiffness behaviour of joint connections bases on the measurement of the relative displacement of the <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> between the <b>joints</b> during applying a load. The measured relative displacement is proportional to the deformations in the joint area. Strain of the test specimen as well as deformations of the load frame or the force measuring cells have no effect in the relative displacement. Two test methods and the necessary measurement technology will be described. On the one hand a method for symmetric joint connections will be shown {{and on the other hand}} a method for unsymmetrical pairings of sheets.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} effect of degreasing, a surface {{preparation}} methods in adhesive bonding, on adhesive joint strength. 5 types of degreasing agents {{were used in the}} study: acetone, extraction naphtha, Ultramyt, Wiko and Loctite 7061. The degreasing operation was performed by three methods: rubbing, spraying and immersion. Strength tests were performed on single-lap adhesive joints of hot-dip galvanized <b>metal</b> <b>sheets</b> made with Loctite 9466 adhesive according to the above variants of surface preparation. The experimental results demonstrate that adhesive joint strength is significantly affected by the applied degreasing agent. Moreover, the method of application of the degreasing agent is crucial, too. The results of strength testing reveal that the most effective degreasing method for hot-dip galvanized <b>metal</b> <b>sheet</b> adhesive <b>joints</b> is spraying using extraction naphtha.
