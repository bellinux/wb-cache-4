5|$|This {{plan was}} {{affected}} by {{the needs of the}} war. As the fighting dragged on and casualties mounted, the various commanders of the Army of the Potomac repeatedly raided the Washington garrison for trained artillerymen and infantry replacements. By 1864, Washington had been <b>stripped</b> <b>to</b> a total less than half that of Barnard's 1861 recommendation.|$|E
5|$|At mid-afternoon, as the chariot reaches alukalam, Aravan is <b>stripped</b> <b>to</b> his {{skeletal}} straw body. Most Aravanis {{have left}} and men wedded to Aravan also break their thalis and bangles and perform all the rites of widowhood (the vellikkal rites) before {{the image of}} Aravan. Meanwhile, a paratiyar (Mahabharata-reciter) {{tells the story of}} the culmination of the war, symbolic of Aravan fulfilling his wish of seeing the war. Hiltebeitel suggests that while the Aravanis weep for Aravan's kalappali, the villagers weep for the death of an ancestor, as life leaves Aravan's head at the end of the war.|$|E

5|$|The name El Chal first {{appears on}} a Spanish Colonial {{watercolour}} from 1735 {{together with other}} villages in the region, {{with the name of}} El Chal or El Chacal. It also appears on a map of central and southeastern Petén from 1860, together with Poptún, Concepción, San Clemente and the ruins of Ixkun. Some of the stonework from the ruins has been <b>stripped</b> <b>to</b> be used {{in the construction of the}} modern village.|$|E
5|$|The {{on-screen}} feud between Rick Rude and Jake Roberts began {{weeks before}} SummerSlam. As {{part of his}} gimmick, Rude would—after winning a match—invite a pre-selected woman from the audience to kiss him in the ring. On one occasion, {{one of the women}} refused to comply, later identifying herself as Robert's wife, Cheryl. As the feud intensified, Rude began wearing a pair of tights with a picture of Cheryl stenciled on them, prompting a furious Roberts to charge into the ring and strip the tights off Rude, appearing to television viewers to leave Rude naked, although the live audience saw him <b>stripped</b> <b>to</b> a G-string instead.|$|E
5|$|To block Bruges, Keyes and Lynes {{decided to}} conduct two raids on the ports through which Bruges {{had access to}} the sea. Zeebrugge was to be {{attacked}} by a large force consisting of three blockships and numerous supporting warships. Ostend was faced by a similar but smaller force under immediate command of Lynes. The plan was for two obsolete cruisers— and —to be expended in blocking the canal which emptied at Ostend. These ships would be <b>stripped</b> <b>to</b> essential fittings and their lower holds and ballast filled with rubble and concrete. This would make them ideal barriers to access if sunk in the correct channel at the correct angle.|$|E

5|$|However, {{this plan}} only applied to men manning {{the walls of}} the fort, not the artillerymen who would be serving the fort's guns. To man the guns of Fort Greble and those of Washington's other forts, Barnard {{designated}} three crews for each gun. These crews would be permanently located at the fort, unlike the men assigned to {{the walls of the}} fort. To fire Fort Greble's planned complement of 15 guns, Barnard assigned 255 artillerymen. This plan was affected by the needs of the war. As the fighting dragged on and casualties mounted, the various commanders of the Army of the Potomac repeatedly raided the Washington garrison for trained artillerymen and infantry replacements. By 1864, Washington had been <b>stripped</b> <b>to</b> a total less than half that of Barnard's 1861 recommendation.|$|E
5|$|The foederati {{make their}} first {{official}} appearance on Trajan's Column, {{where they are}} portrayed in a standardised manner, with long hair and beards, barefoot, <b>stripped</b> <b>to</b> the waist, wearing long trousers held up by wide belts and wielding clubs. In reality several different tribes supported the Romans in the Dacian wars. Their attire and weapons would have varied widely. The Column stereotypes them {{with the appearance of}} a single tribe, probably the most outlandish-looking, to differentiate them clearly from the regular auxilia. Judging by the frequency of their appearance in the Column's battle scenes, the foederati were important contributors to the Roman operations in Dacia. Another example of foederati are the 5,500 captured Sarmatian cavalrymen sent by Emperor Marcus Aurelius (r. 161–180) to garrison a fort on Hadrian's Wall after their defeat in the Marcomannic Wars.|$|E
5|$|The year 1912 saw {{a marked}} {{increase}} in militant action in Wales. Anger at {{the defeat of}} the Conciliation Bills saw the WPSU disrupt a speech by Lloyd George at the Pavilion in Caernarfon. The protesters, male and female, were treated harshly with clothes torn and hair ripped out and were beaten by sticks and umbrellas. Later that year Lloyd George was again heckled by suffragettes whilst delivering a speech at the National Eisteddfod. Just two weeks later {{one of the most notorious}} events in the history of suffrage in Wales took place, when Lloyd George returned to his home town of Llanystumdwy to open the village hall. No sooner had he started speaking than he was interrupted by the cries of 'Votes for Women!' The hecklers were violently assaulted by the crowd. One was <b>stripped</b> <b>to</b> the waist before being rescued and another was almost thrown off a bridge to be dashed on the rocks of the River Dwyfor below. As trouble was anticipated the national press was present and the Daily Mirror and Illustrated London News devoted a full page of photographs to the incident. The local press not only attacked the suffragettes, but poured scorn on the crowd for tarnishing the image of a peaceful, Nonconformist, chapel-going Wales. The event is seen as the most dramatic event in the history of Women's suffrage in Wales.|$|E

25|$|The {{basis of}} the DKM type of motor was that both the rotor and the housing spun around on {{separate}} axes. The DKM motor reached higher revolutions per minute and was more naturally balanced. However, the engine needed to be <b>stripped</b> <b>to</b> change the spark plugs and contained more parts. The KKM engine was simpler, having a fixed housing.|$|E
25|$|Neave paid a rent of £300 to {{take the}} premises, a large sum in 1934, but it was {{justified}} {{by the success of}} the venture. The club registered 445 members within its first six weeks, and was visited by 2004 people. Admission was 1s for members, or 1s 6d on the door. According to the account of a policeman, the walls and ceilings were decorated with material featuring stars and dragons and the entertainment included a man <b>stripped</b> <b>to</b> the waist who passed burning papers over his upper body.

25|$|Following the 1998 {{acquisition}} of the Cunard Line by Carnival Corporation, in 1999 QE2 was given a US$30 million refurbishment which included refreshing various public rooms, and a new colour palette in the passenger cabins. The Royal Promenade, which formerly housed upscale shops such as Burberry, H. Stern and Aquascutum, were replaced by boutiques typical of cruise ships, selling perfumes, watches and logo items. During this refit the hull was <b>stripped</b> <b>to</b> bare metal, and the ship repainted in the traditional Cunard colours of matte black (Federal Grey) with a white superstructure.|$|E
25|$|In 1916, Congress {{approved}} {{funds for}} a complete building renovation.

The building was rededicated as the U.S. Courthouse in 1922. The federal courts moved to the new E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in 1952 and the Old City Hall eventually became {{the headquarters of the}} U.S. Selective Service System. The building was named a National Historic Landmark in 1960 and was returned to the District government two years later for use by the local courts.|$|E

While Farmer stretches out on the raft, a storm begins to arrive : the wind picks up, the rain falls and lightning illuminates the sky. Seal, standing on the raft, is destabilized and falls into the water. Farmer tries to save him giving him her hand, but without success. The night starts to fall and Farmer, now alone on the raft, lights a match and puts off it immediately.|$|E

The surviving walls of Shangqiu in Henan, while extensive, have heavily deteriorated over time. Only small {{parts of the city}} walls protecting the Confucian compound in Qufu are authentic, the rest having been demolished in 1978 and rebuilt in recent years. Some isolated gates of Hangzhou and Suzhou (especially Panmen Gate) have either survived or been rebuilt. Substantial remains of the gates of Zhengding in Hebei have survived but the walls have largely been <b>stripped</b> <b>to</b> their earthen core. One small section of the city wall of Shanghai is visible today.|$|E
25|$|On 5 February 2005, {{the tabloid}} paper New York Daily News {{reported}} that units at Camp Bucca organized {{and held a}} mud wrestling party on 30 October 2004. The party was organized {{by members of the}} 160th MP Battalion and attended by members of the incoming 105th MP Battalion, who were arriving to relieve the members of the 160th. At least three female GIs <b>stripped</b> <b>to</b> their undergarments and wrestled in a kiddie-pool full of sand and water in front of a crowd of male GIs, and one GI flashed her breasts. About 30 photos of the party, including one of the flasher, have been leaked to the press. The flasher, 19-year-old PFC Deanna Allen, was demoted for indecent exposure, and reportedly later discharged from the military.|$|E
25|$|It {{now turned}} out that the {{apparent}} deployment of the States Army in front of the village had been a ruse to draw the Spaniards in. In reality, the reinforced camp of Boussu was located behind the village and his artillery was drawn {{up in front of the}} real line. Five hundred Spanish musketeers and six hundred cavalry now found themselves in very perilous circumstances. The Scottish soldiers <b>stripped</b> <b>to</b> the waist, while singing psalms, and attacked the astounded Spaniards. At the same time the States's artillery opened fire. The Spanish troops were in danger of being annihilated. However, Parma personally extricated them by way of a covered path through the village, while executing one of his famous cavalry manoeuvres. This ended the battle, as Boussu did not follow through.|$|E
