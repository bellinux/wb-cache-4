He {{stepped down from the}} campaign on July 18, 2008, about a week after he made remarks to The Washington Times about the nation's economic conditions. Gramm had said, [...] "You've heard of mental depression; this is a mental recession," [...] and [...] "We have sort of become a nation of whiners. You just hear this constant whining." [...] McCain had quickly repudiated Gramm's remarks, saying [...] "Phil Gramm doesn't speak for me, I speak for me. I strongly disagree." [...] When asked if Gramm was still in contention for the U.S. Treasury Secretary position as previously speculated, McCain had said, [...] "I think <b>Senator</b> <b>Gramm</b> would be in serious consideration for ambassador of Belarus, though I'm not sure the citizens of Minsk would welcome that." [...] Gramm said upon leaving that he had become a distraction to the campaign.|$|E
5000|$|When Congress {{returned}} into {{session for}} two days in mid-November, the sponsor of H.R. 4541, Representative Thomas Ewing (R-IL), described <b>Senator</b> <b>Gramm</b> as the [...] "one man" [...] blocking Senate passage of H.R. 4541.

50|$|On October 13, 1999, the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department {{agreed that}} direct {{subsidiaries}} of national banks (“financial subsidiaries”) could conduct securities activities, but that bank holding companies {{would need to}} engage in merchant banking, insurance, and real estate development activities through holding company, not bank, subsidiaries. On October 22, 1999, <b>Senator</b> <b>Gramm</b> and the Clinton Administration agreed a bank holding company could only become a “financial holding company” (and thereby enjoy the new authority to affiliate with insurance and securities firms) if all its bank subsidiaries had at least a “satisfactory” CRA rating.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1999 and 2001, Gramm was the {{chairman}} of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. During that time he spearheaded efforts to pass banking deregulation laws, including the landmark Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999, which removed Depression-era laws separating banking, insurance and brokerage activities.As a <b>senator,</b> <b>Gramm</b> often called for reductions in taxes and fraud in government spending. He employed his [...] "Dickey Flatt Test" [...] ("Is it worth taking it out of Dickey's pocket?") to determine if federal programs were worthwhile. Richard [...] "Dickey" [...] Flatt owns a family run printing business started by his father and mother in Mexia, Texas, and is a longtime Gramm supporter". In Gramm's eyes, Flatt embodied the burdens that a typical Texas independent small businessman faced in the realm of taxation and government spending.|$|E
50|$|The Senate Banking Committee {{approved}} {{in a straight}} party line 11-9 vote a bill (S. 900) sponsored by <b>Senator</b> <b>Gramm</b> that would have repealed Glass-Steagall Sections 20 and 32 and that did not contain the CRA provisions in the Committee’s 1998 bill. The nine dissenting Democratic Senators, along with Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle(D-SD), proposed as an alternative (S. 753) {{the text of the}} 1998 Committee bill with its CRA provisions and the repeal of Sections 20 and 32, modified to provide greater permission for “operating subsidiaries” as requested by the Treasury Department. Through a partisan 54-44 vote on May 6, 1999 (with Senator Fritz Hollings (D-SC) providing the only Democratic Senator vote in support), the Senate passed S. 900. The day before, Senate Republicans defeated (in a 54-43 vote) a Democratic sponsored amendment to S. 900 that would have substituted the text of S. 753 (also providing for the repeal of Glass-Steagall Sections 20 and 32).|$|E

40|$|Mister Chairman, <b>Senator</b> <b>Gramm,</b> {{and members}} of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs: I welcome this {{opportunity}} to talk with you about the FY 2003 HUD Budget. I speak {{from the perspective of a}} taxpayer who wants to help low-income families. I have no other financial interests in the matters under consideration at this hearing. My views are influenced not only by this perspective but also by my knowledge of the systematic evidence about the effects of low-income housing programs. I have been involved in housing policy analysis since the late 1960 s. Since then, I have done many empirical studies of the effects of low-income housing programs, and I have read carefully a very large number of other studies. During the Nixon Administration, I was an analyst on the Housing Policy Review Task Force that led to the Section 8 Certificate Program. As a visiting scholar at HUD during the Carter Administration, I worked on an evaluation of this program and reviewed the final reports from the Experimental Housing Allowance Program. More recently, I have written a lengthy survey of what is known about the effects of low-income housing programs for a National Bureau of Economi...|$|E
