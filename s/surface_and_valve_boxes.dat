40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: The {{occurrence}} of mechanical valve thrombosis was studied in a chronic sheep model of valve implantation in the pulmonary position. METHODS: Six monoleaflet and six bileaflet mechanical valves were implanted in young sheep. Anticoagulation was stopped at one week postoperatively, after which weekly fluoroscopic evaluation was performed. Animals were sacrificed {{at the moment}} of any abnormality on the fluoroscopic image or, if no abnormality occurred, at fixed time intervals of two and three months. After explantation, valves were examined macroscopically, by stereomicroscopy, histology and scanning electron microscopy. Lung biopsies were taken. RESULTS: All monoleaflet valves remained functionally intact for up to three months without anticoagulation, but explantation after two or three months revealed thrombi attached to struts, cuspal <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> <b>valve</b> ring. All bileaflet valves, except one, showed obvious dysfunction on fluoroscopy (one or both cusps fixed) within a time frame of three to eight weeks after implantation. Histology and scanning electron microscopy showed primary thrombotic material in one or both hinges, obstructing further cusp movement. Lung embolism was detected in only one animal among biopsy specimens. CONCLUSION: The low-pressure environment of the pulmonary position caused primary thrombotic changes in all implanted mechanical valves. The thrombosis caused severe mechanical dysfunction only in the bileaflet valves, probably due to their delicate hinge mechanism. These findings may be used in the further development of an animal model of mechanical valve thrombosis. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Injection nozzles (conical <b>and</b> {{cylindrical}} <b>surface)</b> <b>and</b> <b>valve</b> needles (conical sur-face) {{demand a}} fast and accurate {{measurement of the}} shape of the surface. Standard white-light interferometers are optimized to measure flat <b>surfaces</b> <b>and</b> cannot acquire the complete surface of cylindrical or conical object in one single measurement. We modified our white-light interferometer to measure in cylindrical coordinates. For cylindrical objects a 90 ° conical mirror is use d to illuminate and to observe the measured object. For conical objects the angle of the conical mirror has to be properly adapted. To measure the inner surface, specifically the conical end of the injector nozzle hole, a conical micro-mirror was developed. 1 Basic Principle The white-light interferometer (Coherence radar [1]) measures surfaces by scanning the temporal coherence function of the broadband light source. For each object point we record a correlogram. From the maximum of the correlogram the position of the corresponding object point along the z-axis can be found. Fig. 1 White-light interferometry – optimal for the meas-urement of a flat surface. The standard white-light interferometer is optimal for measuring flat surfaces (Fig. 1). To measure a conical or cylindrical surface we modified the illu-mination and observation in the object arm of the white-light interferometer [2]. With use of the proper conical mirror (Figs. 2 and 3) the illuminating rays are directed perpendicular to the measured surface. The conical mirror acts {{at the same time as}} an imaging device for the re-flected rays [3]. This scheme has a significant advantage:- incoming light is reflected directly back into the interferometer,- we are measuring the whole surface of the ob-ject in one single measurement...|$|R

The meet the first two challenges, researchers are working both on newer engine technologies and fuels. Some of the published work indicates that coating on the combustion surface of the engine with ceramic material results in improved performance and reduced emission levels when fueled with alternate fuel blended fuels, and this serves {{as a base for}} this work. Normal-Butanol has molecular structure that is adaptable to gasoline, and it is considered as one of the alternative fuels for SI engines. Blending butanol with gasoline changes the properties of the fuel and alters the engine performance and emission characteristics. This is because heat which is released at a rate as a result of combustion of the compressed air–fuel mixture in the combustion chamber gets changed with respect to change fuel properties, air fuel ratio, and engine speed. An experimental investigation is carried out on a partially insulated single cylinder SI engine to study the performance and emission characteristics when fueled with two different blends of butanol and gasoline. The cylinder head <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> <b>valves</b> are coated with a ceramic material consisting of Zirconium dioxide (ZrO 2) with 8 % by weight of Yttrium Oxide (Y 2 O 3) to a thickness of 0. 3 mm by plasma spray method.

Its proton linac will include 43 superconducting cavity cryomodules. The nominal operating temperature for the cavities is 2 K, with 40 - 50 K thermal shielding. Required cooling powers will be provided by the accelerator cryoplant and delivered in 4. 5  K and 40 K temperature levels. The 2 K temperature level will be produced at each cryomodule. The cryomodules will be connected with the cryoplant by a dedicated cryogenic distribution system. The system will be composed of a cryogenic transfer line with a splitting box and a cryogenic distribution line with 43 <b>valve</b> <b>boxes</b> <b>and</b> an end box. A number of high-level requirements for the ESS linac impose a highly branched structure for the cryogenic distribution system and strongly influence specific choices related to the detailed designs of <b>valve</b> <b>boxes</b> <b>and</b> cryogenic lines.

50|$|Details of {{the gear}} differ principally in the {{arrangement}} of the expansion link. In early locomotive practice, the eccentric rod ends were pivoted at the ends of the link while, in marine engines, the eccentric rod pivots were set behind the link slot (or below on a vertical engine). These became known respectively as the 'locomotive link' and the 'launch link'. The launch link superseded the locomotive type as it allows more direct linear drive to the piston rod in full gear and permits a longer valve travel within a given space by reducing the size of eccentric required for a given travel. Launch-type links were pretty well universal for American locomotives right from the 1850s but, in Europe, although occurring as early as 1846, they did not become widespread until around 1900. Larger marine engines generally used the bulkier and more expensive marine double-bar link, which has greater wearing <b>surfaces</b> <b>and</b> which improved <b>valve</b> events by minimising geometric compromises inherent in the launch link.|$|R
