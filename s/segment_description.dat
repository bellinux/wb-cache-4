40|$|We {{address the}} problem of generic shape recognition, in which exact models are not available.

The input to our system {{is in the form of}} <b>segmented</b> <b>descriptions</b> of objects in terms of parts. In 2 -D, the shape is incrementally decomposed into parts suggested by curvature sign changes, and for each part an axial description is derived from both local and global information.

30|$|In many {{computer}} vision applications, at a mid-level process, {{it is common}} to fit line segments in order to model a set of unordered points so as to summarize higher level features.

In many of the aforementioned problems, the involved algorithms assume that they are provided with an ordered point set and standard polygonal approximation [4, 5] is then applied. However, determining the ordering of point sets is not a trivial task, and in the method described herein, we relax this assumption by making no prior hypothesis about the ordering of the points.|$|E

The matrix has 1, 2, 4 tents corresponding to T = 1, 2, 3; and is almost uniform for T = 100.

For the simple fixed point attractor in the Minea system, the Reynolds average performs excellently and better than the maximal probability Markov chain and segment linking.

INTRODUCTION The goal of the MPEG- 7 standard [6] is to allow interoperability among devices that deal with audio-visual content description. The standard will involve four types of normative elements: descriptors (Ds), description schemes (DSs), description definition language (DDL), and coded descriptions. A descriptor is a representation of a feature that characterizes the audio-visual content. A description scheme specifies the structure and semantics of the relationships between its components, which may be both descrip [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-A {{navigation}} system is described for a mobile robot {{equipped with a}} rotating ultrasonic range sensor. This {{navigation system}} {{is based on a}} dynamically maintained model of the local environment, called the Composite local model. The composite local model integrates information from the rotating range sensor, the robot’s touch sensor, and a pre-learned global model as the robot moves through its environment. Techniques are described for constructing a line <b>segment</b> <b>description</b> of the most recent sensor scan (the sensor model), and for integrating such descriptions to build up a model of the immediate environment (the composite local model). The estimated position of the robot is corrected by the difference in position between observed sensor signals and the corresponding symbols in the composite local model. A learning technique is described in which the robot develops a global model and a network of places. The network of places is used in global path planning, while the segments are recalled from the global model to assist in local path execution. This system is useful for navigation in a finite, prelearned domain such as a house, office, or factory. I...|$|E

Marketers use the same kind of heuristic devices to describe segments in target markets. Currently measuring over 30  million strong, today's teens are the adult consumers of tomorrow. Therefore, marketers need the ability to divide this teen market into unique segments. In this study, the authors develop a psychographic retail shopping typology of American teens' retail channel preferences depending on levels of self-esteem (SE), extraversion, and interpersonal communication (IC). Three distinct market segments evolve - Social Butterflies, Confident Techies, and Self-Contained Shoppers - and link to channel shopping, spending, and future intentions.

40|$|This study {{developed}} {{a mathematical model}} of human cardiopulmonary system which consists of component models such as ventricular mechanics, hemodynamics of the systemic and pulmonic circulations, baroreflex control of arterial pressure, airway/lung mechanics and gas transport. Instantaneous elastance functions were {{used to describe the}} mechanics of the heart chambers. The resistive, compliant and inertial properties of the circulatory system were characterized by a lumped equivalent hydraulic circuit. Transfer functions were employed to represent the input-output relations of baroreflex pathways. On the pulmonary side, the airways were characterized using a lumped pneumatic model containing a mid-airway collapsible <b>segment.</b> <b>Description</b> of lung mechanics included the resistive, compliant properties of the lung tissue, which exhibited hysteresis. Gas transport was characterized by a distributed compartmental system containing ten contiguous segments. With suitable parameter adjustment, the nominal case simulation yielded realistic predictions of pressure, volume and flow waveforms that agreed well with published data. In addition, it predicted the temporal behavior of variables that are not routinely collected in cardiac catheterization or pulmonary laboratories, and which are difficult to measure. The model also demonstrated stability under large amplitude perturbations of the physiological variables, such as Valsalva maneuver. This model maybe employed usefully to show the detailed nature of normal human cardiopulmonary interactions and baroreflex control (e. g. ventricular interaction, Valsalva maneuver). It also provides methodologies for the development of more specific models of abnormal behavior, and as such, may serve as an aid in clinical diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract OnlyDemand {{structure}} and market segmentation for seafood {{have been investigated}} intensively. However, most the researches so far applied traditional demand analysis and descriptive segmentation approach by separated models. The traditional demand analysis assuming consumer homogeneity, behavior consistence, and using aggregate data may result biased estimation, while the segmentation based on descriptive approach has results less accessible and actionable. We the first used discrete choice model and stated preference data to simultaneously estimate the demand {{structure and}} segments for twelve seafood species in French context. The four-latent segments model have the best fit to the data and demand elasticities estimated are comparable {{to those in the}} traditional studies but provide more efficient and actionable guidance for practitioners. Consistence with previous seafood demand study we found that elasticities of high valued fish such as salmon, tuna, cod, sole, and shrimp are price elastic while low valued species like mussels, oyster, and pangasius are inelastic. Moreover, latent class model revealed that 39. 5 % of the sample are not price sensitive, 29. 6 % moderate sensitive, 20. 3 % sensitive, and 10. 6 % are very sensitive. Similarly, we investigated deeper for particular species and uncovered demand structure of each species. For instance, only 30. 9 % of consumers are price elastic for salmon, while 39. 5 % and 29. 6 % of the sample are inelastic and moderate elastic for this species, respectively. We also regressed the segment membership probabilities on the consumer characteristics to give better <b>segment</b> <b>description</b> and provide efficient guidance for seafood producers and marketers...|$|E

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of channels has created new challenges for research, including understanding how consumers may be segmented {{with respect to}} their information search and purchase behavior in multichannel environment. This research considers shopping a dynamic process that consists of search and purchase phases, in which the total utility of shopping process is determined by the perceived consumer utility toward channel use, which is mainly driven by consumer characteristics. The authors (1) segment consumers {{on the basis of their}} attitudes toward multiple channels as search and purchase alternatives; (2) investigate the association among psychological, economic, and sociodemographic covariates and segment membership; and (3) explore how multichannel behavior might differ across different product categories. Using survey data from 364 Dutch consumers and Latent-Class Analyse, they identify three segments - multichannel enthusiasts, uninvolved shoppers, and store-focused consumers - and covariates, such as shopping enjoyment, loyalty, and innovativeness that predict segment membership. The category-specific analysis suggests that overall <b>segment</b> <b>descriptions</b> apply generally to a variety of categories, though some differences exist, including the impact of covariates, across categories.

40|$|Multiple {{description}} coding (MDC), {{together with}} reconstruction, {{is a popular}} technique for concealing packets losses in a best-effort network like the Internet. In our previous study, we have developed a sample-based MDC scheme for subband images and an optimal reconstructionbased subband transform (ORB-ST) at senders {{that takes into account}} the reconstruction process at receivers. Due to the partitioning of a <b>description</b> into <b>segments</b> before coding the segments by the ORB-ST coder, our previous scheme has severe degradation in quality because, among other reasons, the coder cannot exploit redundancies across multiple <b>segments</b> in a <b>description,</b> especially at low bit rates. To address this issue, we propose in this paper to divide a description into subbands in the frequency domain, instead of <b>segmenting</b> a <b>description</b> in the sample domain. Based on the observation that the corresponding subbands across two descriptions after inverse transformation are correlated, we present a scheme that reconstructs a lost subband using the corresponding subband received in the other description. We show that our scheme is more effective than reconstruction in the full band; that it has similar quality and lower delays in low-loss scenarios and slightly degraded quality in high-loss scenarios, when compared to MDC, unsegmented, and JPEG 2000 -coded images sent by TCP; and that it has much better quality and similar delays when compared to MDC, segmented, and ORB-ST-coded images sent by UDP. 1...|$|R
