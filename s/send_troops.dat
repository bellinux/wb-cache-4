5|$|Having settled {{these matters}} he {{traveled}} to Cyrrhus, a city in Syria between Antioch and the Euphrates, where he {{spent the rest of}} AD 18 in the winter quarters of the Legion X Fretensis. Evidently here Piso attended Germanicus, and quarreled because he failed to <b>send</b> <b>troops</b> to Armenia when ordered. Artabanus sent an envoy to Germanicus requesting that Vonones be moved further from Armenia as to not incite trouble there. Germanicus complied, moving Vonones to Cilicia, both to please Artabanus and to insult Piso who Vonones was friendly with.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the last}} skirmishes of the war took place on July 25. A Swabian army marched from the Hegau on Schaffhausen, but met with fierce defense at Thayngen. Although the small force of {{defenders}} was finally overcome, and the village was pillaged, the defenders inflicted heavy casualties and the attack was held up {{long enough for the}} Swiss to <b>send</b> <b>troops</b> from Schaffhausen to meet the Swabians in the field. Misunderstandings between the Swabian knights and their foot soldiers made the Swabians retreat, and nightfall then prevented a larger battle.|$|E
5|$|Plans for {{combined}} operations {{between the}} Franks and the Mongols were again {{made for the}} following winter offensives, in 1301 and 1302. But in mid-1301 the island of Ruad was attacked by the Egyptian Mamluks. After a lengthy siege, the island surrendered in 1302 or 1303. The Mamluks slaughtered many of the inhabitants, and captured the surviving Templars {{to send them to}} prison in Cairo. In late 1301, Ghazan sent letters to the pope asking him to <b>send</b> <b>troops,</b> priests, and peasants, to make the Holy Land a Frank state again.|$|E
5|$|The British Government {{anticipated}} {{an invasion}} of Greece by the Germans in 1941 and decided to <b>send</b> <b>troops</b> to support the Greeks, who were already engaged against the Italians in Albania.

5|$|The Ionian Revolt {{had begun}} with an {{unsuccessful}} expedition against Naxos, {{a joint venture}} between the Persian satrap Artaphernes and the Milesian tyrant Aristagoras. In the aftermath, Artaphernes decided to remove Aristagoras from power, but before he could do so, Aristagoras abdicated, and declared Miletus a democracy. The other Ionian cities followed suit, ejecting their Persian-appointed tyrants, and declaring themselves democracies. Aristagoras then appealed to the states of mainland Greece for support, but only Athens and Eretria offered to <b>send</b> <b>troops.</b>|$|E
5|$|The decisive {{battle between}} Ottokar II and Rudolph I {{took place on}} 25 August 1278 in the known Battle on the Marchfeld.

5|$|Wilson's {{prestige}} {{encouraged the}} almost immediate formation {{of more than}} a dozen companies of infantry in and around Boston. The pressing need to <b>send</b> <b>troops</b> to the front required Wilson to abandon his original intention of raising multiple regiments of infantry and he instead selected the 10 companies closest to readiness, thus creating the 22nd Massachusetts Regiment. To this regiment were attached the 3rd Massachusetts Light Artillery and the 2nd Company Massachusetts Sharpshooters. Thus, the 22nd Massachusetts became one of the few infantry units in the Civil War with attached artillery and sharpshooters.|$|E

5|$|On 29 April 1970, South Vietnamese and U.S. units {{unleashed}} a limited, multi-pronged Cambodian Campaign that Washington hoped would solve three problems: First, {{it would provide}} a shield for the American withdrawal from Vietnam (by destroying the PAVN logistical system and killing enemy troops) in Cambodia; second, it would provide a test for the policy of Vietnamization; third, it {{would serve as a}} signal to Hanoi that Nixon meant business. Despite Nixon's appreciation of Lon Nol's position, the Cambodian leader was not even informed in advance of the decision to <b>send</b> <b>troops</b> into his country. He learned about it only after it had begun from the head of the U.S. mission, who had himself learned about it from a radio broadcast.|$|E
5|$|Upon the Partition of India in 1947, Manekshaw's unit, the 4th {{battalion}} of the 12th Frontier Force Regiment, {{became part of}} the Pakistan Army, so Manekshaw was reassigned to the 16th Punjab Regiment. While handling the issues relating to partition in 1947, Manekshaw demonstrated his sound planning and administrative skills in his capacity as GSO1. At the end of 1947, Manekshaw was posted as the commanding officer of the 3rd {{battalion of}} 5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force). However, before he moved on to his new appointment, on 22 October, Pakistani forces infiltrated Kashmir, capturing Domel and Muzaffarabad. The following day, the ruler of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, Maharaja Hari Singh, appealed for India to <b>send</b> <b>troops.</b> But the Indian government replied that they would <b>send</b> <b>troops</b> only if Jammu and Kashmir acceded and became part of India. On 25 October, V. P. Menon, then-political advisor to the Viceroy of India, along with Manekshaw flew to Srinagar, with the Instrument of Accession. While Menon was with the Maharaja, Manekshaw carried out an aerial survey of the situation in Kashmir. After the Maharaja had signed the document, they flew back to Delhi the same night. Soon a briefing was held with Lord Mountbatten, and Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, where Manekshaw suggested immediate deployments of troops to save Kashmir from being captured.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War on June 25, 1950, the United Nations voted to <b>send</b> <b>troops</b> into South Korea to aid it against the North Korean Army to prevent the country from collapsing.

5|$|Although not {{initially}} agreeing to <b>send</b> <b>troops</b> to Borneo {{in the opening}} stages of the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, the Australian government did allow its forces stationed in Malaysia {{as part of the}} Far East Strategic Reserve (FESR) to be used to protect Peninsular Malaysia from Indonesian attack. 3 RAR, which was based at Camp Terendak in Malacca, was subsequently used to mop up two small airborne and seaborne landings near Labis and Pontian in September and October 1964. These incursions suggested that a major escalation in the conflict was imminent, and in January 1965 the government conceded to British and Malaysian requests, subsequently agreeing to deploy an infantry battalion to Borneo, in addition to a battery of artillery, an engineer construction squadron, and a squadron from the Special Air Service Regiment.|$|E
5|$|In the Peloponnesian War, {{which had}} ended in 404 BC, Sparta had enjoyed {{the support of}} nearly every {{mainland}} Greek state and the Persian Empire, and in the months and years following that war, {{a number of the}} island states of the Aegean had come under its control. This solid base of support, however, was fragmented in the years following the war. Despite the collaborative nature of the victory, Sparta alone received the plunder taken from the defeated states and the tribute payments from the former Athenian Empire. Sparta's allies were further alienated when, in 402 BC, Sparta attacked and subdued Elis, a member of the Peloponnesian League that had angered the Spartans {{during the course of the}} Peloponnesian War. Corinth and Thebes refused to <b>send</b> <b>troops</b> to assist Sparta in its campaign against Elis.|$|E
5|$|One month later, {{while the}} British warship HMS Romney was in port, {{one of the}} tidesmen changed his story: he now claimed {{that he had been}} {{forcibly}} held on the Liberty while it had been illegally unloaded. On June 10, customs officials seized the Liberty. Bostonians were already angry because the captain of the Romney had been impressing colonists, and not just deserters from the Royal Navy, an arguably illegal activity. A riot broke out when officials began to tow the Liberty out to the Romney, which was also arguably illegal. The confrontation escalated when sailors and marines coming ashore to seize the Liberty were mistaken for a press gang. After the riot, customs officials relocated to the Romney, and then to Castle William (an island fort in the harbor), claiming that they were unsafe in town. Whigs insisted that the customs officials were exaggerating the danger so that London would <b>send</b> <b>troops</b> to Boston.|$|E

5|$|Shahrbaraz, {{along with}} a smaller army, later managed to slip through Heraclius' flanks and bee-lined for Chalcedon, the Sasanian base across the Bosphorus from Constantinople. Khosrow II coordinated with the Khagan of the Avars so as to launch a coordinated attack on Constantinople from both European and Asiatic sides. The army of Shahrbaraz {{stationed}} themselves at Chalcedon, while the Avars placed themselves on the European side of Constantinople and destroyed the Aqueduct of Valens. Because of the Byzantine navy's control of the Bosphorus strait, however, the Sasanians could not <b>send</b> <b>troops</b> to the European side to aid their ally. This reduced {{the effectiveness of the}} siege, because the Sasanians were experts in siege warfare. Furthermore, the Sasanians and Avars had difficulties communicating across the guarded Bosphorus—though undoubtedly, there was some communication between the two forces.|$|E
5|$|The British Government {{anticipated}} {{an invasion}} of Greece by the Germans in 1941 and decided to <b>send</b> <b>troops</b> to support the Greeks, who were already engaged against the Italians in Albania.

The 4th Infantry Brigade was tasked with the defence of the Aliakmon Line in northern Greece, with the 20th Battalion preparing and manning the defences along the western end of the line. On 6 April, the Germans invaded Greece and their advance was so rapid that it quickly threatened the Florina Gap. The 4th Infantry Brigade was withdrawn to the Servia Pass where it manned defences that were superior to its previous positions. On 14 April German forces reached the Servia Pass and the brigade defended its positions for three days before being withdrawn. The battalion was the rearguard of the brigade for most of its withdrawal until it was evacuated to Crete on 28 April.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} the Venetians decided to <b>send</b> <b>troops</b> against the Ottoman advances. Skanderbeg {{gathered}} 13,400 men, among whom were many Venetians, {{to launch an}} assault on the Ottoman besieging camp, who had taken command once Mehmed left Albania after the construction of Elbasan. Skanderbeg had split his army into three parts and surrounded the besiegers. Ballaban was killed during the fighting and the Ottoman forces were left without a commander and a depleted force which was surrounded. Afterwards the Albanian-Venetian forces completed the rout by killing the remaining Ottoman forces before they could escape by way of Dibër. The victory was well received by both Albanians and Italians. This did not signal the end of the war, however, as soon after, Skanderbeg took up some assaults on Elbasan after being urged to by Venice, but was not able to take the fortress due to lack of artillery. Venice itself was in conflict with its Italian neighbors, which led Mehmed to begin another campaign against the Albanians. This would result in another siege on Krujë.|$|E
