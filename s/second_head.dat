5|$|In October 1892, {{shortly after}} he began {{attending}} New York Law School, Crosby was invited by former Yale coach Walter Camp to live in Annapolis, Maryland {{to serve as the}} coach for the United States Naval Academy football team; the program was acting in response to the appointment of Crosby's former teammate, Henry L. Williams, as coach for the Army team. Navy had first extended the offer to Camp, who suggested Crosby would fulfil the role more effectively. Crosby accepted the invitation, and became the <b>second</b> <b>head</b> coach in Navy history and the first who was independent of the program. The previous coach, Vaulx Carter, attended the academy, and had revived the program. Crosby's strategy for practices {{was one of the most}} intensive used at the academy during its early years; after classes every day, the team played two 45 minute games against a team of 22 backup players, followed immediately by a long swimming session in a cold pool. Shortly before the season began, Crosby hired former St. John's College, Johns Hopkins, and Lehigh player Paul Dashiell to serve as his assistant coach.|$|E
5|$|Structure 5D-43 is {{an unusual}} radial temple in the East Plaza, built over a {{pre-existing}} twin pyramid complex. It {{is built into the}} end of the East Plaza Ballcourt and possessed four entry doorways and three stairways, the fourth (south) side was too close to the Central Acropolis for a stairway on that side. The building has a talud-tablero platform profile, modified from the original style found at Teotihuacan. In fact, {{it has been suggested that}} the style of the building has closer affinities with El Tajin and Xochicalco than with Teotihuacan itself. The vertical tablero panels are set between sloping talud panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols. Large flower symbols are set into the sloping talud panels, related to the Venus and star symbols used at Teotihuacan. The roof of the structure was decorated with friezes although only fragments now remain, showing a monstrous face, perhaps that of a jaguar, with another head emerging from the mouth. The <b>second</b> <b>head</b> possesses a bifurcated tongue but is probably not that of a snake. The temple, and its associated ballcourt, probably date to the reign of Nuun Ujol Chaak or that of his son Jasaw Chan K'awiil I, in the later part of the 7th century.|$|E

Over {{the course of the}} 1949 season, Hirsch tallied 326 receiving yards, 287 rushing yards, and 55 return yards on two interceptions. During the 1949 season, Hirsch also {{became one of the first}} NFL players to wear a plastic helmet. After Hirsch sustained a <b>second</b> <b>head</b> injury (having previously suffered a skull fracture in 1948), Rams coach Shaughnessy had a special, 11-ounce helmet designed for Hirsch, using a strong, light plastic that had been used previously in the construction of fighter planes.|$|E

25|$|With Head Coach Bill Barber's {{promotion}} to the Flyers after the 1999–2000 season {{as an assistant}} (and later head) coach, Assistant Coach John Stevens—who {{had been forced to}} retire as a player the previous season because of a serious eye injury—became the <b>second</b> <b>head</b> coach of the Phantoms in June 2000. Stevens, the team's first captain, was soon joined by two more former Flyer players, defenseman Kjell Samuelsson and winger Don Nachbaur, to complete the new staff. In November 2003, long-time NHL tough guy and former Flyer left wing Craig Berube signed with the Phantoms to finish his 18-year professional career back in Philadelphia as a player/assistant coach. At the end of that season, he retired as a player to become a full-time assistant coach for the 2004–05 campaign, replacing Nachbaur, who had since returned to the Western Hockey League (WHL) as head coach of the Tri-City Americans.|$|E
25|$|As {{the use of}} {{the long}} drum began to spread across Europe, many composers and musicians started looking for even deeper tones {{that could be used in}} compositions. As a result of this demand, a narrow-shelled, {{single-headed}} drum called the gong drum was introduced in Britain during the 19th century. This drum, which was 70-100 centimeters in diameter and deep-shelled, was similar to the long drum in both size and construction. When struck, the gong drum produced a deep sound with a rich resonance. However, the immense size of the drum, coupled with the fact that there was not a <b>second</b> <b>head</b> to help balance the sound, meant that gong drums tended to produce a sound with a definite pitch. As a result, they fell out of favor with many composers, as it became nearly impossible to incorporate them in an orchestra in any meaningful way.|$|E
25|$|While Duke University’s {{reputation}} grew as {{a national}} educational institution, its attitudes towards black workers remained unchanged. The same year the Duke Employees Benevolent Society was established in 1965, Duke revealed a new $200 million plan to promote Duke’s status as a top national university. The funds were used to advance the renovation of new libraries, science research labs, and more modern facilities. Despite Duke University’s reputation as an institution for higher education and its growing expertise in preparing its students for the professional society, the working environments and attitudes towards black, blue-collar workers had not changed. Workers were not given health insurance, received little pay, had inconsistent and demanding schedules, often working ten to twelve days without a day off, and were treated unprofessionally. One nurse’s maid, Helen Johnstone, recalled being treated like a servant: “When I was a nurse’s maid, our <b>second</b> <b>head</b> nurse, Joan Ashley, she used to run me everywhere—uptown to get the immunizations and {{to put them in}} my refrigerator. She had me run to the library to return her books for her on time.” It was not unusual for black workers to be treated this way, especially as a result of unclear job descriptions that gave those with higher power control over the tasks assigned to black workers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Routing {{protocols}} in VANET {{are considered}} {{as one of the}} critical dilemmas that need to be tackled, especially in sparse environment. Thus designing an efficient routing mechanism has an impact on enhancing the network performance in terms of disseminating messages to their desired destinations. This paper proposes a novel routing protocol in VANET for sparse environment called Vehicle <b>Second</b> <b>Heading</b> Direction Routing Protocol (VSHDRP), which is designed to leverage the probability of delivering a data packet to its destination and to increase connectivity and route stability by utilizing the knowledge of the <b>Second</b> <b>Heading</b> Direction (SHD) in the process of selecting the next-hop node. This new routing protocol contains two modes; the highway straight mode and the roundabout mode. Moreover, the two modes of VSHDRP protocol are formalized in the Calculus of Context-aware Ambients (CCA) and simulated using the CCA interpreter ccaPL in order to analyse and validate the behaviour of the protocol...|$|R

On June 9, despite Brent Sutter winning 51 games (a franchise record), he resigned as head coach of the New Jersey Devils after two first-round playoff losses because of family reasons. One day later on June 10, Dave Tippett was fired as head coach of the Dallas Stars after missing the playoffs {{for the first time since}} the 2001–02 season, when Rick Wilson took over as coach. Marc Crawford was named the new head coach for the 2009–10 season the next day.

500|$|The next broad debate, {{with the}} same five {{candidates}} as the LSE debate, in the campaign came on LBC on 22 March. Khan and Goldsmith were accused of immature insults when discussing Goldsmith's plan to allow electric cars to use bus lanes During April, further debates occurred, with the first on 12 April a head-to-head between Goldsmith and Khan on behalf of City A.M.. The issue of Goldsmith's campaign was raised, with Khan accusing Goldsmith of running a negative campaign and Goldsmith accusing Khan of hiding behind the label of Islamophobia. The topics of housing, transport and job-creation were all key points in the debate. [...] The BBC hosted a debate with the five major candidates broadcast on BBC One in London on 18 April. The Guardian noted an absence of any clear winner, with Khan and Goldsmith focused on each other, Berry and Pidgeon offering very similar policies and Whittle distinct but with no chance of victory. Similarly, The Spectator said {{that there had been}} a lukewarm response to policy statements from all candidates.
