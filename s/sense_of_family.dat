Her constancy toward fulfilling her duty, along with the birth of children, softened PedroII's attitude. The two discovered shared interests, and their concern for and delight in their children created a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>family</b> happiness. That they were sexually active and compatible is witnessed by the series of pregnancies which ensued. After the birth of their first son in February 1845, the Empress bore children in July 1846, July 1847, and July 1848—named Afonso, Isabel, Leopoldina and Pedro, respectively.|$|E

During this time, Pedro II was kept unaware of events occurring outside the palace, including political matters. News which did intrude upon the emperor and his sisters concerned deaths within their family. In December 1834, they learned of the early and unanticipated death of their father. A few months later their grandfather Francis II, who had shown great interest in his grandchildren, died (June 1835). These losses drew the emperor and his sisters closer together and strengthened their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>family,</b> {{despite the absence of}} their parents.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{penultimate}} novel, You Only Live Twice, that Fleming gave Bond a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>family</b> background, using a fictional obituary, purportedly from The Times. The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr. No in cinemas and Sean Connery's depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character. The novel reveals Bond is the son of a Scottish father, Andrew Bond, of Glencoe, and a Swiss mother, Monique Delacroix, of the Canton de Vaud. The young James Bond spends much of his early life abroad, becoming multilingual in German and French because of his father's work as a Vickers armaments company representative. Bond is orphaned at the age of 11 when his parents are killed in a mountain climbing accident in the Aiguilles Rouges near Chamonix.|$|E

The participants of the study were 250 female (64 %), 143 male (36 %) total 393 university students. The age range was 19. 45. To collect data Life Satisfaction Scale, <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> Coherence, <b>Family</b> <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> Coherence and Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale were used. After collecting data Pearson Momentum Correlation and Stepwise regression statistic analysis were applied. The results indicated that there are significant positive moderate and relatively strong correlations between life satisfaction and individualistic <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> coherence, <b>family</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> coherence and self esteem. The findings of this study supported Antonovsky’s theoretical frame. In addition the stepwise regression analyses indicated that comprehensibility (cognitive dimension) dimension <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> coherence was the best predictor of life satisfaction. The other variables were <b>family</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> coherence, self esteem, manageability and meaningfulness respectively. All variables explained 40 % of total variance...|$|R

5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{penultimate}} novel, You Only Live Twice, that Fleming gave Bond a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>family</b> background. The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr. No in cinemas and Sean Connery's depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character, to give Bond both a sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories. In a fictional obituary, purportedly published in The Times, Bond's parents were given as Andrew Bond, from the village of Glencoe, Scotland, and Monique Delacroix, from the canton of Vaud, Switzerland. Fleming did not provide Bond's date of birth, but John Pearson's fictional biography of Bond, , gives Bond a birth date on 11 November 1920, while a study by John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{makes an}} {{appointment}} {{at the clinic}} and pays for it by pawning their television. This only frustrates {{the rest of the}} Simpsons as he takes them to the scheduled appointment. In the waiting room, they claim the family doesn't have a problem and are silenced by Homer. Dr. Monroe encourages them to express their unhappiness with a series of exercises. The first is a drawing exercise, which he encourages them to draw out the source of their problems. Most of the Simpsons vent out their anger by drawing Homer as they see him. When Dr. Monroe observes it, he realizes that Homer is likely the source of their issues in the family. This is evident when he proves his own inattentive nature in being lost in the exercise and having the family view him as such, including being too strict as a disciplinarian. The other methods in getting the family {{to talk to each other}} in a normal matter fail. Dr. Monroe finally takes matters into his own hands and sends them all to a generator room, allowing them to deliver electric shocks to each other. The family shocks one another to the point of causing a power drain on the city. Unable to help them, Dr. Monroe gives the Simpsons double their money back. With a fresh <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>family</b> unity, they use the money to buy a new television set.|$|E

We investigate properties (in the broader <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> sets) whose complexity is {{much less than the}} maximum (which is n 2 for graph properties). It is well known that such properties must be representable as a disjoint union of long intervals (in the boolean lattice of graphs on V). We show that, if the number of intervals is not too large, the converse is true as well. We also show that there are graph properties whose complexities differ by at most 4 n from any given number between 2 n − 4 and n 2. Finally, we give estimates on the complexity of the scorpion graph property...|$|R

[...] All the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>family,</b> of belonging, of responsibility and loyalty inherent in the word [...] "tribe" [...] has to be felt by the cast." [...] To enhance this feeling, O'Horgan put the cast through sensitivity exercises based on trust, touching, listening and intensive examination that broke down barriers between the cast and crew and encouraged bonding. [...] These exercises were based on techniques developed at the Esalen Institute and Polish Lab Theater.
