By applying the muon's range through matter [...] to the open-sky muon energy spectrum, the value of the fraction of incident muon flux that is transmitted through the object can be analytically derived. A muon with a different energy has a different range, which is defined as a distance that the incident muon can traverse in matter before it stops.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Silica</b> <b>dioxide</b> (SiO 2) can be {{modified}} by impregnating amine-containing compound to improve CO 2 adsorption capacity.

40|$|Doped {{nanoparticles}} {{based on}} titanium dioxide {{are of interest}} for their multifunctional properties and enlarged photocatalytic activity in visible domain. <b>Silica</b> doped titanium <b>dioxide</b> nanoparticles were prepared by hydrothermal method and their structural characteristics and photocatalytic activity were determined, {{in order to be}} used for leather coating as alternative to halogen based flame retardants and dry cleaning solvents. A range of concentrations from 2 % to 20 % <b>silica</b> doped titanium <b>dioxide</b> nanoparticles (% denotes the theoretical weight percent of Si) was synthesized and characterized by ICP-OES, FT-IR, UV-vis spectroscopy, XRD, HRTEM and DLS. Titanium dioxide network penetration was supported by Si-O-Ti and OH identification in FT-IR spectra mainly on surface of 10 % and 20 % <b>silica</b> doped titanium <b>dioxide</b> nanoparticles. The increase of Si-O-Ti bonds with Si dopant concentration acts as efficient barriers against sinterization and growth of TiO 2 particles and explains the low particle size identified in HRTEM analyses as compared to undoped TiO 2 NPs. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of doped titanium dioxide nanoparticles showed the shifting of absorption band to visible domain for 10 % <b>silica</b> doped titanium <b>dioxide</b> nanoparticles. The crystallite sizes were calculated from XRD spectra, ranging between 16. 2 and 18. 1  nm. HRTEM measurement of hydrothermally synthesized titanium dioxide nanoparticles showed anatase crystallites in the range of 8. 8 – 27  nm, while in the 20 % <b>silica</b> doped titanium <b>dioxide</b> nanoparticle sample smaller crystallite with sizes between 2. 7  nm and 3. 5  nm was identified due to the constraints of the SiO 2 -based amorphous matrix. Nano sizes of 64  nm and 72  nm were found in water dispersions of 10 % and 20 % <b>silica</b> doped titanium <b>dioxide</b> nanoparticles and the Zeta potentials were of − 53. 6  mV and − 52. 9  mV, which indicate very good stabilities. The leather surface treated with composites of film forming polymers and 10 % <b>silica</b> doped titanium <b>dioxide</b> nanoparticles displayed photocatalytic properties against methylene blue dye under UV and visible light exposure, attributed to reactive species generation with effect on surface hydrophilicity increase. The activation energies for decomposition of leathers treated with 10 % and 20 % <b>silica</b> doped titanium <b>dioxide</b> nanoparticles were 2. 083  ×  104  J/mol and 2. 36  ×  104  J/mol respectively, as compared to 6. 576  ×  103  J/mol for untreated leathers, showing increased thermal stability according to DSC measurements.

The most pronounced changes were in ileum morphology, consisting of a massive lymph macrophage and eosinophil infiltration of villi, without any apparent violation of their epithelial layer structure, which indirectly indicates the absence of violations of the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium. At the maximum dose of 100 mg/kg bw, the increased immune response was the most significant in the wall of the ileum.
