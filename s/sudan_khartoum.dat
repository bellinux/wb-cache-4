40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the impact of China’s need for sustained access to oil resources in post-Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) Sudan and Southern Sudan. Applying an integrated conceptual framework (a combination of economic nationalism and Daniel Yergin’s three themes in which the political narratives of oil are grounded), China’s domestic drivers can be identified as the augmentation and security of national power, economic growth and autonomy, modernisation and substantial industrialisation. In order to fulfil these aims, China has a great need for natural resources, especially oil. A prime example of China’s pursuit of sustained access to oil resources is its involvement in the greater Sudan. As a result of the vast amounts of oil, as well as the absence of western competition, Sudan became an obvious choice for China. As a result of the signing of the CPA in 2005, China has had to adjust its principle of upholding formal state sovereignty (and its exclusive relationship with <b>Sudan</b> (<b>Khartoum)),</b> which practically means that it can engage with Southern Sudan (most importantly to secure its vast oil interests in the region). Evidence presented in this dissertation would suggest that {{it is likely that the}} greater Sudan is descending towards a possible violent breakup - the main reason being that the CPA has not been fully implemented, largely as a result of Sudan’s (Khartoum) attempts to stall and/or derail the CPA to continue its control over oil resources and the subordination of Southern Sudan. China is arguably the only state that has positive relations with, and substantial influence in, both <b>Sudan</b> (<b>Khartoum)</b> and (albeit to a lesser extent) Southern Sudan. Taking into account that the establishment of a context conducive to stability and peace in the greater Sudan is in its best strategic interest, China has a responsibility (to itself as well as to the greater Sudan) to bring <b>Sudan</b> (<b>Khartoum)</b> and Southern Sudan to the table to negotiate the most pressing issues. It can use its position as most important investor and importer of Sudanese oil to apply pressure on both sides to reach agreements on key outstanding matters, as well as to establish a framework for the road ahead. Even though China is in some circles regarded as Africa’s new colonising power, and even though there are many negative connotations attached to China’s modus operandi on the continent, it now has both the opportunity and the ability to use its influence to help bring about lasting peace to a country devastated by decades of civil war.

40|$|In this review, we collate {{information}} about ticks identified {{in different parts}} of the Sudan and South Sudan since 1956 in order to identify gaps in tick prevalence and create a map of tick distribution. This will avail basic data for further research on ticks and policies for the control of tick-borne diseases. In this review, we discuss the situation in the Republic of South Sudan as well as Sudan. For this purpose we have divided Sudan into four regions, namely northern Sudan (Northern and River Nile states), central <b>Sudan</b> (<b>Khartoum,</b> Gazera, White Nile, Blue Nile and Sennar states), western Sudan (North and South Kordofan and North, South and West Darfour states) and eastern Sudan (Red Sea, Kassala and Gadarif states) ...|$|E
40|$|Page(s) : 11 (2), 300 - 304, 5 Ref. Social {{acceptance}} of duck raising {{and consumption of}} their products were investigated via a questionnaire conducted among the inhabitants of Wad Medani city (Gezira State – Sudan). About 22 % and 25 % of them have, respectively, eaten ducks' eggs and meat before. They preferred ducks' eggs (26 %) and meat (38 %) to that of chicken's. The taste of ducks' eggs and meat, as evaluated by the inhabitants, was 39 %, 62 % as excellent, 36 %, 32 % as good, 21 %, 6 % as fair and 4 %, 0. 0 % as bad, respectively. The study showed that, about 60 % of the sample will consume ducks' products if they are accessible, and home duck keeping practice is acceptable to 68. 78 % of the sample. There are only very few religious and social taboos that discourage or prohibit raising and consuming ducks' eggs and meat in central <b>Sudan.</b> <b>Khartoum</b> University Pres...|$|E

Stratification ratio values (SRVs) of {{the soil}} {{characteristics}} is a quantitative parametric approach proposed in this study to reveal the magnitude of favourable conditions and/ or adverse effects imposed by applying long-term conventional tillage system for soil management. This {{study was conducted in}} selected sandy clay loam soils belonging to the soil order Aridisols. The study showed that SRVs of soil organic carbon in surface soil are very low (0. 75 to 1. 01), compared to that of the subsurface, suggesting high rate of mineralization in the soil surface. Lower ratio values of bulk densities (0. 77 to 0. 98) were accompanied by higher ratio values of total porosity (0. 51 to 1. 18) in subsurface soils, indicating improvement in the physical properties. These findings could be considered as land quality indicators improving management technical specification packages and; adding input to the range of characteristics of the established soil series and; to the land quality set for the designation of land suitability classes elsewhere in the <b>Sudan.</b> <b>Khartoum</b> University Pres...|$|E
