40|$|Foreign {{language}} (FL) {{films with}} <b>subtitles</b> {{are becoming increasingly}} popular, and many European countries use <b>subtitling</b> as a cheaper alternative to dubbing. However, {{the extent to which}} people process <b>subtitles</b> under different <b>subtitling</b> conditions remains unclear. In this study, participants watched part of a film under standard (FL soundtrack and native language <b>subtitles),</b> reversed (native language soundtrack and FL <b>subtitles),</b> or intralingual (FL soundtrack and FL <b>subtitles)</b> <b>subtitling</b> conditions while their eye movements were recorded. The results revealed that participants read the <b>subtitles</b> irrespective of the <b>subtitling</b> condition. However, participants exhibited more regular reading of the <b>subtitles</b> when the film soundtrack was in an unknown FL. To investigate the incidental acquisition of FL vocabulary, participants also completed an unexpected auditory vocabulary test. Because the results showed no vocabulary acquisition, the need for more sensitive measures of vocabulary acquisition are discussed.

40|$|Abstract - The {{current study}} aims to {{investigate}} the potential of <b>subtitling</b> (i. e. creating <b>subtitles)</b> {{as a means to}} teach/learn specialised content and a foreign language simultaneously and attempts to measure its impact by comparing creating <b>subtitles</b> to watching <b>subtitled</b> video. This was operationalized in the following research questions: Does creating <b>subtitles</b> help the acquisition of scientific content? Does creating <b>subtitles</b> help the acquisition of scientific vocabulary? How does creating <b>subtitles</b> compare to watching <b>subtitled</b> video? And, does creating <b>subtitles</b> increase the student’s interest in science? In order to answer these research questions, two experiments were carried out: a group of students created English and Italian <b>subtitles</b> for a set of short videos in English about chemistry and physics. Subsequently, some of the videos were shown to a different group of students, accompanied by English and/or Italian <b>subtitles.</b> All the students were tested on the contents and language in the videos. The students who created <b>subtitles</b> were assessed about seven days after completion of the work, while the students who watched ready-made <b>subtitles</b> were tested immediately after watching the video. The study showed that both activities (watching ready-made <b>subtitles</b> and creating <b>subtitles)</b> helped content understanding and language memorization. It also suggested that creating <b>subtitles</b> is probably a much more effective activity for language and content acquisition than watching <b>subtitles.</b> Finally, it showed that, though both activities increased students’ interest in science, creating <b>subtitles</b> increased the students’ interest to a higher extent. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} difficulties and problems that subtitlers may encounter in <b>subtitling</b> colloquial expressions from Arabic into English. To achieve the main objectives of the study, some authentic examples have been obtained from the <b>subtitled</b> film The Dupes and  analyzed linguistically and translationally {{in order to identify}} the <b>subtitling</b> inaccuracies, to highlight the <b>subtitling</b> strategies used by the film's <b>subtitler,</b> and to draw other workable <b>subtitling</b> solutions for dealing with colloquialisms or slang language.

2500|$|The only {{significant}} difference for the user between SDH <b>subtitles</b> and closed captions is their appearance: SDH <b>subtitles</b> usually are displayed {{with the same}} proportional font used for the translation <b>subtitles</b> on the DVD; however, closed captions are displayed as white text on a black band, which blocks {{a large portion of}} the view. Closed captioning is falling out of favor as many users have no difficulty reading SDH <b>subtitles,</b> which are text with contrast outline. In addition, DVD <b>subtitles</b> can specify many colors, on the same character: primary, outline, shadow, and background. This allows subtitlers to display <b>subtitles</b> on a usually translucent band for easier reading; however, this is rare, since most <b>subtitles</b> use an outline and shadow instead, in order to block a smaller portion of the picture. Closed captions may still supersede DVD <b>subtitles,</b> since many SDH <b>subtitles</b> present all of the text centered, while closed captions usually specify position on the screen: centered, left align, right align, top, etc. This is helpful for speaker identification and overlapping conversation. Some SDH [...] <b>subtitles</b> (such as the <b>subtitles</b> of newer Universal Studios DVDs/Blu-ray Discs) do have positioning, but it is not as common.|$|R
40|$|Video {{recordings}} can be <b>subtitled</b> {{in three}} ways: with first language (L 1) <b>subtitles,</b> with second language (L 2) <b>subtitles,</b> or with first language plus second language (bilingual or L 1 +L 2) <b>subtitles.</b> The first {{two types of}} <b>subtitles</b> are widely discussed in previous research with regard to how they affect language learning. However, the effects of bilingual <b>subtitles</b> have not been widely studied. This study aims to examine the pedagogical effects of bilingual <b>subtitles</b> on vocabulary acquisition in the L 2 classroom. A seven-week quasi-experimental {{study was conducted with}} four English-major classes in year- 3 in a Chinese university: three experimental groups and one control group. Students in the three experimental classes were exposed to three documentary films on very similar topics with the three different types of <b>subtitles</b> in turn. They then took a vocabulary test relating to the lexical items encountered in the films. At the end of the experiment, they were given a questionnaire to explore their opinions towards differential <b>subtitles</b> in relation to their language learning. The results demonstrated a significant advantage of bilingual <b>subtitling</b> in videos for students’ receptive vocabulary knowledge and recall at post-test and this advantage was maintained at delayed post-test. The bilingual <b>subtitles</b> probably are more effective than monolingual <b>subtitles</b> with regard to students’ vocabulary acquisition in short-term and long-term. Also, bilingual <b>subtitles</b> were preferred by a majority of students in respect of video understanding and vocabulary learning. L 2 <b>subtitles</b> were favoured by more students for improving their listening comprehension. Pedagogical implications for the use of differential <b>subtitles</b> in the L 2 classroom are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (English)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2004. As {{a result}} of the lack of {{provision}} for Deaf and hard-of-hearing television viewers on South African television channels, there is a pressing need for research on ways in which to accommodate this community in this regard. Consequently, this study focuses on one possible solution to the problem, namely the optimal use of open <b>subtitles</b> for the benefit of this viewer group. There are three primary ways in which Deaf and hard-of-hearing television viewers are able to access information and entertainment, namely sign language, lip-reading, and <b>subtitling.</b> <b>Subtitling</b> is the most common method used for making television programrnes accessible to Deaf viewers. Currently, the dominant mode for <b>subtitled</b> programmes broadcast across SABC TV channels is open <b>subtitling</b> d 11 o to the fact that very few households have access to the decoders required for closed <b>subtitling.</b> At present, South Africa does not have specific legislation for <b>subtitling</b> for the Deaf viewer nor does the broadcasting industry follow any standardised set of <b>subtitling</b> guidelines. In addition, the number of programmes that are <b>subtitled</b> (or even intermittently <b>subtitled)</b> is limited and insufficient for Deaf viewers. This suggests that these viewers are not being adequately accommodated in terms of prograrrme viewing and do not have the necessary access to information. The first step in accommodating Deaf and hard-of-hearing television viewers effectively will be the standardisation and consistent application of <b>subtitling</b> guidelines. For this purpose, this study presents a model for optimising open <b>subtitles</b> for Deaf viewers. This model is devised by means of a synthesis of the parameters for closed <b>subtitling</b> and the <b>subtitling</b> needs of Deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers in South Africa. In the process, those principles of closed <b>subtitling</b> that provide this group with all the information that are available to hearing viewers are transferred to open <b>subtitling.</b> The guiding principle nevertheless remains not to alienate the hearing audience by ntroducing unnecessary visual obstacles.
