5|$|Once half-time was reached, it {{was clear}} that Scotland, and Jim Leighton in particular, were in difficulty. In the {{dressing}} room, Leighton admitted that the reason he had missed the cross {{at the end of the}} first half, which led to the last-ditch save at the feet of Mark Hughes, was that he was <b>shortsighted</b> and had lost one of his contact lenses. Not only that, but he did not have a spare pair with him. Leighton had not been forthcoming about his eyesight because of fears that it might harm his career. As a consequence, that the goalkeeper even needed lenses was something that his team mates, Alex Ferguson (who was also Leighton's club manager at Aberdeen) or, most importantly, Jock Stein did not know.|$|E
25|$|By late 1754, {{the siege}} of Prome was going nowhere for Talaban's men. The besiegers {{had been able to}} fight off Konbaung {{attempts}} to lift the siege but they could not take the fortified city either. At Pegu, some of the Hanthawaddy commanders now feared Alaungpaya's full-scale invasion of the south, and looked for an alternative. Preferring the loose rule of a weak king, they attempted to free the captive king, Mahadhammaraza Dipati on the throne of Hanthawaddy. The plot was discovered by Binnya Dala, who executed not only the conspirators but also the former king himself and other captives from Ava in October 1754. This <b>shortsighted</b> action removed the only possible rival to Alaungpaya, and allowed those who had stayed loyal to the former king to join Alaungpaya with an easy conscience.|$|E
25|$|The revised {{sequence}} concept {{applies only}} to the industrial system – that is, the manufacturing core {{of the economy in}} which each industry contains only a handful of very powerful corporations. It does not apply to the market system in the Galbraithian dual economy. In the market system, composed of the vast majority of business organizations, price competition remains the dominant form of social control. In the industrial system, however, composed of the 1,000 or so largest corporations, competitive price theory obscures the relation to the price system of these large and powerful corporations. In Galbraith's view, the principal function of market relations in this industrial system is, not to constrain the power of the corporate behemoths, but to serve as an instrument for the implementation of their power. Moreover, the power of these corporations extends into commercial culture and politics, allowing them to exercise considerable influence upon popular social attitudes and value judgments. That this power is exercised in the <b>shortsighted</b> interest of expanding commodity production and the status of the few is both inconsistent with democracy and a barrier to achieving the quality of life that the new industrial state with its affluence could provide.|$|E
500|$|A leading theory among audiences {{was that}} Chloe would {{eventually}} change {{her name to}} Lois Lane, Clark's wife in the comics, as she embodies various characteristics that Lois Lane has in the comic books. The creative team removed the notion that Chloe {{was going to turn}} into Clark's future wife when they introduced Lois Lane in season four. Though the characters share similarities, according to Mack, Chloe and Lois are more [...] "different shades of the same color [...] Chloe is a softer version of Lois". Chloe's upbringing allows her to be less jaded than Lois. Chloe also looks to the future, whereas Lois is more <b>shortsighted.</b>|$|E
500|$|Another {{major project}} of the 1960s and 1970s was Interstate 787 and the South Mall Arterial. Construction {{began in the early}} 1960s. One of the project's main results, since regretted, was {{separating}} the city from the Hudson River, its source of development. Corning has been described as <b>shortsighted</b> with respect to use of the waterfront, as he could have used his influence to change the location of I-787, which now cuts the city off from [...] "its whole [...] ". Much of the original plan never came to fruition, however: Rockefeller had wanted the South Mall Arterial to pass through the Empire State Plaza. The project would have required an underground trumpet interchange below Washington Park, connecting to the (eventually cancelled) Mid-Crosstown Arterial. To this day, evidence of the original plan is still visible. In 1967 the hamlet of Karlsfeld was the last annexation by the city, taken from the Town of Bethlehem.|$|E
500|$|Stanley {{praises the}} series saying [...] "It's not clear exactly why this bleak series is so exhilarating and binge-worthy. It {{could be that}} just as victims of tragedy {{find it hard to}} accept that their {{suffering}} is random and purposeless, voters find it intolerable that so many of the petty, <b>shortsighted</b> moves by elected officials have no greater meaning than small-time expediency." [...] She also notes that the series [...] "is more cynical than The Americans on FX and more pessimistic about human nature than The Walking Dead on AMC". However, The Americans [...] "is more complex and inventive" [...] according to Stanley who concurs that season 2 is darker but notes it is more compelling than season 1. [...] Stuever compares the show unfavorably to both Veep for its [...] "bumbling chaos and ego implosions" [...] over House of Cards [...] "prohibitively sinister" [...] execution and The Good Wife for its superior delivery of [...] "nastiness and self-interest in power plays".|$|E
500|$|Stephen Holden of The New York Times {{criticized the}} {{contract}} amount, considering it a gamble for Virgin. He stated that Jackson [...] "is a producer-dependent artist—i.e., someone who relies on others {{to make her}} sound interesting and trendy. She also lacks a sharply defined personality, both {{as an artist and}} celebrity. Where singers like Ms. Houston and Mariah Carey have commanding vocal power, Ms. Jackson's is a relatively indistinguishable studio voice." [...] Richard Branson rebutted this argument stating [...] "Ms. Jackson has met with great success working with the production team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, just as her brother Michael Jackson has experienced his greatest successes with the producer Quincy Jones. It is interesting that Mr. Holden doesn't mention this similar 'liability' when discussing Michael Jackson. To say that Ms. Jackson is 'dependent' on her producer is a <b>shortsighted</b> observation. She is a formidable talent who stands on her own." [...] Michael Jackson would break his sister's record only days later, when he signed a $60 million contract with Sony Music Entertainment. Both sibling's contracts garnered considerable criticism. Los Angeles Times reported that [...] "A Records President Al Cafaro, whose company lost the fierce bidding battle over Janet Jackson to Virgin Records, said record companies may be vesting too much importance in individual performers" [...] as the funds used as advances to the Jacksons could have launched recording careers for numerous unknown talents. Cliff Burnstein of Q-Prime [...] management commented that recording artists demands for advances upon signing would begin to escalate from that point forward.|$|E
2500|$|Influenced by {{the most}} radical {{thinking}} {{to emerge from the}} French Revolution of 1789-1794, Skidmore's book was a challenge to the views of Thomas Jefferson regarding the [...] "rights of man" [...] and Jefferson's call for [...] "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" [...] for what he believed to be a <b>shortsighted</b> omission of the role of property in subverting political and judicial equality between citizens.|$|E
2500|$|David Edelstein of Slate {{argued that}} [...] "The Israeli {{government}} and many conservative and pro-Israeli commentators have lambasted the film for naiveté, for implying that governments should never retaliate. But {{an expression of}} uncertainty and disgust {{is not the same}} as one of outright denunciation. What Munich does say is that this <b>shortsighted</b> tit-for-tat can produce a kind of insanity, both individual and collective." ...|$|E
2500|$|Leigh, cofounder and {{director}} of BAYSWAN, {{who is also a}} bisexual feminist author and artist, criticized 2006 proposed legislation introduced by U.S. Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa} in the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee as being <b>shortsighted.</b> She stated, [...] "Forced labor (and) kidnapping should be targeted, but this legislation broadly targets the sex trade in general" [...] (including legal businesses like escorts and strip clubs).|$|E
2500|$|Watterson {{spent much}} of his career trying to change the climate of {{newspaper}} comics. He believed that the artistic value of comics was being undermined, and that the space which they occupied in newspapers continually decreased, subject to arbitrary whims of <b>shortsighted</b> publishers. Furthermore, he opined that art should not be judged by the medium for which it is created (i.e., there is no [...] "high" [...] art or [...] "low" [...] art—just art).|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} side, Donovan {{described}} the result as [...] "an unfortunate interpretation ... {{that will allow}} small states to override the longstanding consumer protection laws of more heavily populated ... states." [...] His co-counsel Ann Miller called the decision [...] "incorrect and <b>shortsighted</b> ... I don't think that the answer the U.S. Supreme Court came up with {{is going to be}} the long-term resolution of the problems posed by old laws trying to deal with new and very changed banking practices." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dulles {{was one of}} {{the pioneers}} of massive {{retaliation}} and brinkmanship. In an article written for Life magazine, Dulles defined his policy of brinkmanship: [...] "The ability to get to the verge without getting into the war is the necessary art." [...] Dulles' hard line alienated many leaders of nonaligned countries when on June 9, 1955, he argued in a speech that [...] "neutrality has increasingly become obsolete and, except under very exceptional circumstances, it is an immoral and <b>shortsighted</b> conception." [...] Throughout the 1950s Dulles was in frequent conflict with those non-aligned statesmen he deemed excessively sympathetic to Communism, including India's V.K. Krishna Menon.|$|E
2500|$|Though he didn't {{really need}} them, Gerald Harper wore false eyebrows {{based on the}} make-up lady's own eyebrows. He also wore a wig. Harper was a bit <b>shortsighted</b> and wore glasses, which he removed as soon as filming was ready to start. His shortsightedness did cause opponents to keep their {{distance}} in sword-fights since, as one actor put it, he could have inadvertently knocked their eye out. When the series ended, the make-up lady sewed the eyebrows onto a sampler, with [...] "Here lie the Eyebrows of Adam Adamant, 1966–1967" [...] underneath, which was framed and given to Harper as a memento. Harper also kept Adam's swordstick, and both remain on his wall at home to this day.|$|E
2500|$|Abandonment of {{passenger}} {{service for}} the second time on this route (by the same political party) was especially controversial for southwestern New Brunswickers who viewed it as a convenient excuse by the federal government to cut the service for both <b>shortsighted</b> fiscal and strategic political reasons. [...] Paul Martin was making aggressive budget cuts throughout the federal government, thus concentrating service on the Oceans route would likely save some money. [...] The Ocean also travelled a route that passed through then-Minister of Transport Doug Young's riding of Acadie-Bathurst. [...] The Atlantic also passed through the only two ridings in the country which elected Progressive Conservatives - Elsie Wayne in Saint John and Jean Charest in Sherbrooke. [...] It also didn't help that the Atlantic passed through Maine (U.S. territory) on its short route between Montreal and Saint John.|$|E
2500|$|Elbow {{have cited}} {{a number of}} {{influences}} on their music, including Genesis (in particular the progressive rock years featuring Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett), Talk Talk and Radiohead. Guy Garvey has said: [...] "I {{grew up listening to}} every Genesis record. I learned to write harmonies by listening to Peter Gabriel." [...] The song [...] "Newborn" [...] from Elbow's debut album was directly influenced by [...] "Entangled" [...] from the Genesis album A Trick of the Tail. Garvey has also said [...] "there'd be no Elbow without Radiohead". He credits the band's sense of dynamics to the influence of Talk Talk and has said: [...] "Volume dynamics are an essential part of classical music, but a lost art with guitar music. I think it's incredibly boring and <b>shortsighted</b> if a band sticks with just one sound song for song. An album should take people on a journey." ...|$|E
2500|$|Due to <b>shortsighted</b> Congressional penny-pinching, {{very few}} live-fire {{trials of the}} torpedo or {{exploder}} were ever done, and those only in top secrecy. The goal of most exercise firings {{was to get the}} torpedo to run under the target, after which it was assumed the magnetic influence feature would do the work. This misplaced trust in the magnetic exploder helped mask the depth problems encountered by early torpedoes, for if the exploder were to work properly a depth error of a few feet would not matter. Chief of Naval Operations William V. Pratt offered the hulk of [...] , but prohibited the use of a live warhead, and insisted BuOrd pay the cost of refloating her if she was hit in error. These were strange restrictions, as Ericsson was due to be scrapped. BuOrd declined. A service manual for the exploder [...] "was written—but, for security reasons, not printed—and locked in a safe." ...|$|E
2500|$|By then, the {{historian}} lived a bohemian life, {{and was a}} regular at Fialcovsky Coffeehouse, where he appeared [...] "jocular and always absent minded". According to the recollections of Mariu Theodorian-Carada, although [...] "Boniface Florescu" [...] and Demetriade made efforts to keep it alive, by 1886 [...] "Fialkovsky was dwindling". Potra notes that Florescu was memorable as a Bucharest [...] "type", [...] "with his quite disheveled appearance, his paddling, slow and measured stride, and above all with his way of life". Reportedly, he always wore just one galosh, or sometimes one of his wife's boots, and his suits were covered in ink blots. Gheorghe Gh. Longinescu, who was schooled at Saint Sava, recalls that his teacher had an unusual, crooked, stride, which matched his handwriting. An unnamed Saint Sava alumnus recalled in 1926: [...] "Just about every day, he would walk the streets reading from a newspaper or a book, and, since he was <b>shortsighted,</b> he kept [...] very close to his eyes, and so he bumped into streetlights or street corners, after which he would present his excuses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Albrecht-Carrié {{writes that}} before the German surrender, Woodrow Wilson {{dispatched}} a note to the German Government on 5 November 1918 stating that the Allies [...] "under-stand that compensation {{will be made by}} Germany for all damage done to the civilian population of the Allies and their property by the aggression of Germany by land, by sea, and from the air", the terms of which they accepted. Regardless of which, Albrecht-Carrié says the reparation section of the treaty proved [...] "to be a dismal failure". Campbell says, [...] "although there was much in the peace that was 'petty, unjust, and humiliating', there was little aside from reparation clauses and certain territorial concessions, which had much real bearing upon Germany's economic future". Summarizing the view of economists throughout the 1920s, she says the territorial changes to Germany were [...] "not necessarily...economically unsound", but than the removal of the Saar and territory to Poland [...] "depriv Germany of her resources in excess of the amount necessary to fulfill the legitimate economic demands of the victors... was indefensible". Campbell also said the treaty failed to include [...] "provisions looking to the restoration of Germany to her former position as the chief economic and financial stabilizing influence in central Europe" [...] and that this was economically <b>shortsighted</b> and was an economic failing of the treaty.|$|E
