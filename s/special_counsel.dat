5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}.

Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The <b>special</b> <b>counsel</b> report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the leaks and said they were intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E

5000|$|General Harding {{created a}} pilot program called the <b>Special</b> Victims' <b>Counsel</b> Program [...] , which {{provides}} victims of sexual assault with their own independent attorneys. In 2013, the Secretary of Defense directed other military services to follow the Air Force pilot program and provide <b>Special</b> Victims' <b>Counsel</b> to their service members, who are survivors of military sexual assault. The 2014 National Defense Authorization Act, passed by Congress in 2013 and {{signed into law by}} President Barack Obama, requires all services to follow the Air Force program and provide <b>Special</b> Victims' <b>Counsel</b> to service members who are victims of sexual assault. In 2014, the Department of Justice awarded the Air Force a Special Service Award for its <b>Special</b> Victims' <b>Counsel</b> Program.

Nick Matzke, Jason Rosenhouse and other critics have commented that the Office of <b>Special</b> <b>Counsel</b> itself appears biased in its initial handling of the matter, given the links between the religious right and the Republican Party, with George W.
