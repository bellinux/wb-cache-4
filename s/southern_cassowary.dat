5|$|The double-eyed fig parrot (Cyclopsitta diophthalma) {{eats the}} fruit of Ficus obliqua, {{steadily}} depositing fruity detritus on the ground. The rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus moluccanus) is another parrot that consumes the fruit and disperses the seeds; other Australian bird species include the <b>southern</b> <b>cassowary</b> (Casuarius casuarius), brown cuckoo-dove (Macropygia phasianella), rose-crowned fruit dove (Ptilinopus regina), wompoo fruit dove (P. magnificus), wonga pigeon (Leucosarcia melanoleuca), topknot pigeon (Lopholaimus antarcticus), silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), pied currawong (Strepera graculina), black-faced cuckoo-shrike (Coracina novaehollandae), olive-backed oriole (Oriolus sagittatus), Australasian figbird (Sphecotheres vieilloti), green catbird (Ailuroedus crassirostris), regent bowerbird (Sericulus chrysocephalus), satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus), and Lewin's honeyeater (Meliphaga lewinii). The tree is an important food source for the western Polynesian species the many-coloured fruit dove (Ptilinopus perousii) and crimson-crowned fruit dove (P. porphyraceus), and has been recommended for amenity planting in Tonga for these birds. The spectacled flying fox (Pteropus conspicillatus) and grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) also eat the fruit.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{birds in}} New Guinea are the flightless cassowaries, of which all three species are native to New Guinea. Two of these species: the <b>southern</b> <b>cassowary</b> (Casuarius casuarius) and the {{northern}} cassowary (Casuarius unappendiculatus) reach heights of 1.8 metres (6ft). The <b>southern</b> <b>cassowary</b> is also native to northern Australia. The cassowary {{is one of the}} world's most dangerous birds, for it is capable of inflicting fatal injuries with its powerful legs and the dagger-like claw on its inner toe. It is known to have killed humans.|$|E

25|$|The {{exhibit is}} opening in phases with phase one {{including}} a boat trip around the enclosures {{for visitors to}} view some of the zoo's key species from South East Asia, including Visayan warty pigs, <b>southern</b> <b>cassowary,</b> Javan banteng, lowland anoa and North Sulawesi Babirusa; plus a walk-through bird aviary featuring the critically endangered Bali Starling, as well as Java Sparrows, Pied Imperial Pigeons and Yellow-Backed Chattering Lorys.|$|E
25|$|The zoo has also, in the past, {{attracted}} {{a lot of}} criticism for keeping single and unpaired specimens of rare species like the banteng, great Indian one-horned rhinoceros, crowned crane and the lion-tailed macaque. Lack of breeding and exchange programs has led to the elimination of individuals and populations of environmentally vulnerable species like the <b>southern</b> <b>cassowary,</b> wild yak, giant eland, slow loris and echidna.|$|E
25|$|Near the {{entrance}} to the zoo is the Main Lake which has two islands. One is home to a group of black-and-white ruffed lemurs and the other to a family of Javan gibbons. Next to the Main Lake and opposite the cafe are exhibits which are home to the <b>southern</b> <b>cassowary</b> and the Goodfellow's tree kangaroo. It also includes Australian pelicans that move around in the waters.|$|E

25|$|Australia and its territories {{are home}} to around 800 species of bird; about 350 of these are endemic to the zoogeographic region that covers Australia, New Guinea and New Zealand. The fossil record of birds in Australia is patchy; however, there are records of the {{ancestors}} of contemporary species {{as early as the}} Late Oligocene. Birds with a Gondwanan history include the flightless ratites (the emu and <b>southern</b> <b>cassowary),</b> megapodes (the malleefowl and Australian brush-turkey), and a huge group of endemic parrots, order Psittaciformes. Australian parrots comprise a sixth of the world's parrots, including many cockatoos and galahs. The kookaburra is the largest species of the kingfisher family, known for its call, which sounds uncannily like loud, echoing human laughter.|$|E

50|$|The Coastal Wet Tropics Important Bird Area {{comprises}} a disjunct 521 km2 {{stretch of}} coastal and subcoastal land in tropical Far North Queensland, Australia.

2500|$|Studies {{have shown}} that some birds use their beaks to rid {{themselves}} of excess heat. The toco toucan, which has the largest beak relative {{to the size of}} its body of any bird species, is capable of modifying the blood flow to its beak. This process allows the beak to work as a [...] "transient thermal radiator", reportedly rivaling an elephant's ears in its ability to radiate body heat. Measurements of the bill sizes of several species of American sparrows found in salt marshes along the North American coastlines show a strong correlation with summer temperatures recorded in the locations where the sparrows breed; latitude alone showed a much weaker correlation. By dumping excess heat through their bills, the sparrows are able to avoid the water loss which would be required by evaporative cooling—an important benefit in a windy habitat where freshwater is scarce. Several ratites, including the common ostrich, the emu and the <b>southern</b> <b>cassowary,</b> use various bare parts of their bodies (including their beaks) to dissipate as much as 40% of their metabolic heat production. Alternately, studies {{have shown that}} birds from colder climates (higher altitudes or latitudes and lower environmental temperatures) have smaller beaks, lessening heat loss from that structure.|$|E

50|$|Local conservationists {{strongly}} {{oppose this}} urban development/resort complex for many reasons. The influx {{of up to}} 5,000 people into this wilderness area is feared to {{have the potential to}} cause great harm to this refuge area. Associated traffic into this area will threaten the safety of endangered <b>southern</b> <b>cassowaries</b> and endangered frog species. Critically endangered coastal rainforest will be destroyed to provide access to the property development and to clear sites for 100 residences at the Little Cove development site. Conservationist Russell Constable from the Cassowary Coast Alliance is concerned that coastal dolphin species, which are already threatened, will be adversely impacted by increased boat and jet ski activity from the areas new residents, as will nesting marine turtles. Conservationists also claim it is unwise to place so many people in area that is so susceptible to the impacts of tropical cyclones and has a history of such disasters.|$|R
