40|$|Abstract. A {{torsional}} vibration {{model of the}} <b>slewing</b> <b>mechanism</b> of a hydraulic excavator is developed to predict its free vibration characteristics with consideration of many fundamental factors, such as the mesh stiffness of gear pairs, the coupling relationship of a two stage planetary gear trains and the variety of moment of inertia of the input end caused by the motion of work equipment. The natural frequencies are solved using the corresponding eigenvalue problem. Taking the moment of inertia of the input end for example to illustrate {{the relationship between the}} natural frequencies of the <b>slewing</b> <b>mechanism</b> and its parameters, based on the simulation results, just the first order frequency varies significantly with the moment of inertia of the input end of the <b>slewing</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Design of state-of-the art crane {{mechanisms}} {{involves a}} multi-stage and multi-criterial optimization. Depending on the specificity and intended {{use of the}} machine, the optimal structure and dimensions of its mechanisms are sought as well as optimal algorithms for drive control and regulation, which requires the application of optimization criteria. It appears, however, that the approach relying on the minimum of a specifically formulated quadratic functional enables the selection of optimal geometric parameters of the mechanism and, besides, proves effective as the method of drive control. Furthermore, the geometric parameters of the mechanism can be optimized for its entire working range. Simplicity, universality and efficiency of the method are demonstrated on {{the example of a}} slewing one-link jib crane system. The search for the optimal control strategy of drive mechanisms is illustrated in the study that investigates an asymmetrically loaded platform suspended on ropes and people moving with respect to it during the hoisting phase.

5000|$|The Beardmore Crane had two {{opposite}} cantilevered jibs, both {{equipped with}} moving winches, {{for a total}} length of 233 ft. From the job to the ground extended a tapering lattice, which was enclosed by a lattice tower. The jib was <b>slewed</b> by a <b>mechanism</b> on the ground, and bearings {{at the top of}} the tower and where the extension met the ground allowed it to turn. The winch on each arm was powered by two [...] electric motors for hoisting and two [...] motors for slewing, and a [...] motor for slewing. The tower took eight minutes to make a full revolution.|$|R
