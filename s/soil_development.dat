It {{is limited to the}} eastern portions of the formation and is thickest near Arches National Monument. The member is composed of drab greyish mudstones and some lenses of sandstone. The mudstones were deposited on flood plains, and show evidence of ancient <b>soil</b> <b>development</b> called paleosols. The mudstones originated as flood deposits from river channels that are marked by the sandstone lenses. Radiometric dating places the Yellow Cat Member at 126 ± 2.5 Ma (Barremian).|$|E

50|$|Loss of soluble {{minerals}} {{leaves the}} upper part of the soil enriched in insoluble materials, particularly clay minerals. At the same time, biological activity leads to an accumulation of humus in the surface soil, which is protected from further decomposition by the clay. The upper soil horizon of a Rendzina therefore contains considerable amounts of humus. It can also be relatively carbonate- or gypsum-rich, although at levels much lower than in the rocky parent material.Progressive breakdown of the parent material and loss of carbonate or gypsum will ultimately convert a Rendzina into another soil type. Since these processes occur relatively fast in comparison to weathering of most carbonate- and gypsum-free materials, Rendzinas represent a transitory stage in <b>soil</b> <b>development.</b> However, they can persist over the long term if soil loss by erosion counteracts the <b>soil</b> <b>development</b> process.|$|E
