These matrix cracks {{can result in}} a 40 percent <b>secant</b> <b>modulus</b> loss in some laminates, even when fatigued below the fatigue limit. It is shown that the same amount of fatigue damage will develop during stress or strain-controlled tests. Stacking sequence has little influence on <b>secant</b> <b>modulus</b> loss. The <b>secant</b> <b>modulus</b> loss in unidirectional composites is small, whereas the losses are substantial in laminates containing off-axis plies. A simple analysis is presented that predicts unnotched laminate <b>secant</b> <b>modulus</b> loss due to fatigue. The analysis is based upon the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of the fiber and matrix, fiber volume fraction, fiber orientations, and the cyclic-hardened yield stress of the matrix material. Excellent agreement was achieved between model predictions and experimental results. With this model, designers can project the material stiffness loss for design load or strain levels and assess the feasibility of its use in stiffness-critical parts.

40|$|Characterization of {{nonlinear}} hysteretic responses plays {{a significant}} role in predicting soil behaviors. They are mostly described with either simple empirical functions or complex constitutive models. However, the input parameters lack both a physical basis and robustness, and the use of these models is limited to some typical soils.

Deviations from Hooke's linear constitutive law were also registered {{in the range of}} initial: small reads both in uniaxial compression and tension of crystalline rocks. Nonlinearity of strain in rocks is manifested primarily in the stress dependency of tangent or <b>secant</b> elasticity <b>modulus</b> and Poisson's ratio and is caused by closure, initiation, propagation and linkup of pre-existing and new microcracks, frictional sliding along cracks, growth of dislocations, etc. Many experimenters and standardization procedures assume that the dependence of the strain on the applied stress is linear and for practical calculations only two elasticity constants are used: the tangent or <b>secant</b> elasticity <b>modulus</b> at 50 %, of the failure load in compression and Poisson's ratio at the same stress level. Apart from nonlinearity many rock types and concretes have quite different stress-strain relations in tension and compression. Yet direct tensile testing is seldom performed because of its many inherent difficulties. such unrecognized double elasticity and nonlinearity of rocks can invalidate a stress analysis, and in addition, produce a meaningless overestimate (or underestimate) of tensile strength based upon the modulus of rupture derived from a bending test. In Part I of the present study, it is shown that both double elasticity and nonlinearity {{have a profound effect on}} flexural strength of rocks as predicted by application of fundamental continuum damage mechanics relations and an appropriate technical theory. The proposed theory is validated in Part II of this work, in which an appropriate back-analysis procedure is suggested for the characterization of the mechanical properties of Dionysos marble in the uniaxial tension and compression regime from properly designed three-point bending tests.

40|$|Geosynthetics are {{commonly}} used as anti-reflective cracking systems in asphalt pavements. The rehabilitation design methods use the characteristics of as-received geosynthetics as inputs. However, these materials undergo physical damage during their installation due to mechanical and thermal loads which currently are not {{taken into account in}} the design processes. These loads can produce a reduction in geosynthetic strength and therefore, it is necessary to know the <b>secant</b> <b>modulus</b> after installation in order to improve the pavement design incorporating these materials. The <b>secant</b> <b>modulus</b> of a material indicates its initial stiffness. This paper describes an experimental study of damage due to installation of five different geosynthetics using three different procedures: (i) mechanical damage induced in the laboratory considering the action of aggregates, (ii) in situ mechanical and thermal damage due to actual installation in a test section, and (iii) a new mechanical and thermal damage experimental test developed with the aim of reproducing the real installation conditions.

A series of relationships were developed from experimental data, which facilitated {{the establishment of}} the strain-based model.
