Calcium lactate is used as an additive in numerous food and pharmaceutical products. Basically, it has to satisfy quality requirements. That was the reason why the procedure for its synthesis had to be optimized in aspects of selection of reactants, their molar ratio, necessary laboratory equipment, reactant addition order, working temperature, isolation of final product from the reaction mixture, yield and product quality. A <b>semi-industrial</b> <b>installation</b> for the production of calcium lactate pentahydrate is projected on the basis of the results of this investigation. The importance of this investigation arises from the fact that this salt is not produced in Serbia and the complete quantity (about 20 t per year) is imported...|$|E
