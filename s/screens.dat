5|$|Folding screen: The folding {{screen is}} a type of {{furniture}} consisting of several frames or panels. <b>Screens</b> date back to China during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty period (771–256 BC). These were initially one-panel <b>screens</b> in contrast to folding <b>screens.</b> Folding <b>screens</b> were invented during the Han Dynasty (206 BC - AD 220). Depictions of those folding <b>screens</b> have been found in Han Dynasty era tombs, such as one in Zhucheng, Shandong Province. During the Tang Dynasty, folding <b>screens</b> were considered ideal ornaments for many painters to display their paintings and calligraphy on. Many artists painted on paper or silk and applied it onto the folding screen. The landscape paintings on folding <b>screens</b> reached its height during the Song Dynasty (960–1279).|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{assess the}} {{cost-effectiveness}} of <b>screening</b> 50 - to 70 -year-old adults for hearing loss in The Netherlands. We compared no <b>screening,</b> telephone <b>screening,</b> Internet <b>screening,</b> <b>screening</b> with a handheld <b>screening</b> device, and audiometric <b>screening</b> for various starting ages and a varying number of repeated screenings. MethodsThe costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for no <b>screening</b> and for 76 <b>screening</b> strategies {{were analyzed using}} a Markov model with cohort simulation for the year 2011. <b>Screening</b> was deemed to be cost-effective if the costs were less than € 20, 000 /QALY. ResultsScreening with a handheld <b>screening</b> device and audiometric <b>screening</b> were generally more costly but less effective than telephone and Internet <b>screening.</b> Internet <b>screening</b> strategies were slightly better than telephone <b>screening</b> strategies. Internet <b>screening</b> at age 50 years, repeated at ages 55, 60, 65, and 70 years, was the most cost-effective strategy, costing € 3699 /QALY. At a threshold of € 20, 000 /QALY, this strategy was with 100 % certainty cost-effective compared with current practice and with 69 % certainty the most cost-effective strategy among all strategies. ConclusionsThis study suggests that Internet <b>screening</b> at age 50 years, repeated at ages 55, 60, 65, and 70 years, is the optimal strategy to <b>screen</b> for hearing loss and might be considered for nationwide implementation...|$|R
