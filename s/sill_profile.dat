40|$|This {{study was}} done to a product {{development}} unit of a Finnish elevator technology com-pany and it was focused {{on one of the}} components of the whole elevator, the door sill as-sembly. The study had two goals, the main goal was to introduce and to further develop a test system created for testing door sill assemblies, and the secondary goal was to create a technical documentation about the door sill assembly for training purpose. The main issue with the sill assembly {{is that one of the}} main components of the whole as-sembly, the <b>sill</b> <b>profile,</b> does not have duty ranges. The <b>sill</b> <b>profile</b> is the visual part of the whole sill assembly and it guides the movement of elevator doors. Always when something is introduced to the elevator car, it goes over the sill profiles. There are different kinds of sill profiles available for different kind of use, but at the moment the main issue is that it is not known how much wear each profile can take. This often leads to a situation where wrong kinds of sill profiles are delivered with the elevator. A typical example is that too weak sill profiles are delivered with an elevator expecting heavy use, and eventually the sill profiles breaks down. The test system for testing door sill assemblies was already created before this study wa...|$|E
50|$|The {{windows in}} the presbytery are {{narrower}} than the {{windows in the}} nave and they fill only two sectioned tracery. The windows sit on the window <b>sill</b> on the <b>profiled</b> moulding as same as in the nave. The moulding is also in the presbytery where narrow shafts of the arch ascend from the mouldings. Sculptural decorated heads are situated on the tops of the shafts. On the top of the column heads are closed by slight polygonal profiled covering slabs and pear ribs derive from those slabs. The ribs are attached to the target pins. The whole arch is completed by crosswised ribs in a semi-circle and creates the impression of a spreading arch.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{transfer}} of heat into wet sediments from magmatic intrusions or lava flows {{is not well}} constrained from field data. Such field constraints on numerical models of heat transfer could significantly improve our understanding of water–lava interactions. We use experimentally calibrated pollen darkening to measure the temperature profile around a basaltic sill emplaced into wet lakebed sediments. It is well known that, upon heating, initially transparent palynomorphs darken progressively through golden, brown, and black shades before being destroyed; however, this approach to measuring temperature has not been applied to volcanological questions. We collected sediment samples from established Miocene fossil localities at Clarkia, Idaho. Fossils in the sediments include pollen from numerous tree and shrub species. We experimentally calibrated changes in the color of Clarkia sediment pollen and used this calibration to determine sediment temperatures around a Miocene basaltic sill emplaced in the sediments. Results indicated a flat temperature profile {{above and below the}} sill, with T > 325 °C within 1 cm of the basalt-sediment contact, near 300 °C at 1 – 2 cm from the contact, and ~ 250 °C at 1 m from the <b>sill</b> contact. This <b>profile</b> suggests that heat transport in the sediments was hydrothermally rather than conductively controlled. This information will be used to test numerical models of heat transfer in wet sediments on Earth and Mars...|$|R
