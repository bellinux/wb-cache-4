50|$|Clocks {{were some}} of the most complex early {{mechanical}} devices. Clock makers were important developers of machine tools including gear and <b>screw</b> <b>cutting</b> machines, and were also involved in the mathematical development of gear designs.

50|$|Some lathes {{have only}} one {{leadscrew}} that serves all carriage-moving purposes. For <b>screw</b> <b>cutting,</b> a half nut is engaged {{to be driven by}} the leadscrew's thread; and for general power feed, a key engages with a keyway cut into the leadscrew to drive a pinion along a rack that is mounted along the lathe bed.|$|E
30|$|Drilling and coring, as {{effective}} ways to obtain lunar regolith along the longitudinal direction, are widely applied in the lunar sampling field. Conventionally, modeling of drill-soil interaction was divided into soil <b>cutting</b> and <b>screw</b> conveyance processes, ignoring the differences in soil mechanical properties between them. To improve the modeling accuracy, a hypothesis that divides the drill-soil interaction into four parts: <b>cuttings</b> <b>screw</b> conveyance, <b>cuttings</b> extruding, cuttings bulldozing, and in situ simulant cutting, is proposed to establish a novel model based on the passive earth pressure theory. An iterative numerical calculation method is developed to predict the drilling loads. A drilling and coring testbed is developed to conduct experimental tests. Drilling experiments indicate that the drilling loads calculated by the proposed model match well the experimental results. The proposed research provides the instructions to adopt a suitable drilling strategy to match the rotary and penetrating motions, to increase the safety and reliability of drilling control in lunar sampling missions.|$|R
30|$|According to the {{structure}} of the drill tool, the interaction between the drill tool and lunar regolith simulant is divided into four parts: <b>cuttings</b> <b>screw</b> conveying, chip extruding, chip bulldozing, and in situ simulant cutting. Considering the boundary condition and simulant density difference among these four parts, a drill-simulant interaction model is developed to predict the drilling load during simulant drilling, based on the screw conveying and the passive earth pressure theory.|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{described}} a novel, minimally invasive reconstruction technique of lateral tibial plateau fractures using a three-screw jail technique and {{compared it to}} a conventional two-screw osteosynthesis technique. The benefit of an additional screw implanted in the proximal tibia from the anterior at an angle of 90 ° below the conventional two-screw reconstruction after lateral tibial plateau fracture was evaluated. This new method was called the jail technique. Methods: The two reconstruction techniques were tested using a porcine model (n[*]=[*] 40). Fracture was simulated using a defined osteotomy of the lateral tibial plateau. Load-to-failure and multiple cyclic loading tests were conducted using a material testing machine. Twenty tibias were used for each reconstruction technique, ten of which were loaded in a load-to-failure protocol and ten cyclically loaded (5000 times) between 200 and 1000 N using a ramp protocol. Displacement, stiffness and yield load were determined from the resulting load displacement curve. Failure was macroscopically documented. Results: In the load-to-failure testing, the jail technique showed a significantly higher mean maximum load (2275. 9 N) {{in comparison to the}} conventional reconstruction (1796. 5 N, p[*] [*] 0. 05). In cyclic testing, the jail technique also showed better trends in displacement that were not statistically significant. Failure modes showed a tendency of <b>screws</b> <b>cutting</b> through the bone (cut-out) in the conventional reconstruction. No cut-out but a bending of the lag screws {{at the site of the}} additional third screw was observed in the jail technique. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that the jail and the conventional technique have seemingly similar biomechanical properties. This suggests that the jail technique may be a feasible alternative to conventional screw osteosynthesis in the minimally invasive reconstruction of lateral tibial plateau fractures. A potential advantage of the jail technique is the prevention of screw cut-outs through the cancellous bone. <br...|$|R

40|$|NoThe x-axis {{dynamics}} of {{a milling machine}} where the workpiece and saddle are mounted on supporting slides is considered. A permanent magnet motor, lead screw, ball nut and bearings are employed as the machine, traverse actuator mechanism. Hybrid, distributed¿lumped parameter methods are used to model the machine tool x-axis drive system. Inclusion of the spatial configuration of the drive generates the incident, travelling and reflected vibration signature of the system. Lead screw interactive torsion and tension loading, which is excited by cutting and input disturbance conditions, is incorporated in the modelling process. Measured and results from simulation exercises are presented in comparative studies enabling the dynamic characteristics of the machine to be identified under, no load and with the application of cyclic, cutting force disturbances. The effect of the lead <b>screw</b> length, <b>cutting</b> speed and hence the load disturbance frequency are examined and the resulting performance accuracy is commented upon...|$|R
40|$|Removal of locking {{plates in}} many ways poses novel {{challenges}} compared to conventional plates. None of the techniques described {{for the removal of}} locking plates are adequate for all situations. We report our experience of 27 patients from whom a total of 33 locking plates were removed. We also describe a novel technique for the removal of locking plates which in our experience could be used in most of these patients because it is appropriate for all situations and, from a technical point of view, is easy to use. Our new technique consists of removing the problematic locking <b>screw</b> by <b>cutting</b> the plate {{on both sides of the}} screw hole and using the screw head-plate hole unit for removal. We analyzed all these patients for the location of the plate, number of locking screws, time of implant removal since the initial surgery, reason for removal of the plate, nature of the difficulties encountered during surgery, and any perioperative complications. A total of 43 (17. 34 %) screws were difficult to remove. Twenty screws were found to be stripped, 15 were jammed and 8 were broken. Fourteen of the 20 stripped screws and all 15 jammed screws were removed using our technique. We found this technique of locking plate removal to be very versatile and useful in most of the cases in which removal was difficult. At the same time, it also causes less damage to the bone compared to other techniques...|$|R

50|$|Metalworking taps {{and dies}} were often made by their users during the 18th and 19th centuries (especially if the user was skilled in toolmaking), using such tools as lathes and files for the shaping, and the smithy for {{hardening}} and tempering. Thus builders of, for example, locomotives, firearms, or textile machinery {{were likely to}} make their own taps and dies. During the 19th century the machining industries evolved greatly, and the practice of buying taps and dies from suppliers specializing in them gradually supplanted most such in-house work. Joseph Clement was one such early vendor of taps and dies, starting in 1828. With the introduction of more advanced milling practice in the 1860s and 1870s, tasks such as cutting a tap's flutes with a hand file became a thing of the past. In the early 20th century, thread-grinding practice went through significant evolution, further advancing {{the state of the art}} (and applied science) of <b>cutting</b> <b>screw</b> threads, including those of taps and dies.|$|R
2500|$|In the Gotthard Railway's {{early days}} {{ultrasound}} {{was not available}} to examine the tracks. Fractures within these were far more common than today, when special ultrasound equipped trains are employed in the maintenance process. The railway watchman was especially important in ensuring the Gotthard railway's safe operation. A railway watchman was assigned to a special segment of tracks which he had to inspect every day. Fractures, deformations and the tracks' general condition were to be reported to the track master. Tending to loose <b>screws</b> and <b>cutting</b> down shrubs were {{also part of the}} watchman's job description. Also putting out small shrub fires, caused by the heavily employed brakes of downhill running cargo trains, were part of his duty. The railway watchman was equipped with a red flag to be able to stop trains in an emergency. The Gotthard railway's [...] watchmen lived in specially provided [...] along the line. In Italian Language these watchman's houses are called Casello. Every day they had to inspect the tracks up to the next watchman's segment. The watchman houses were built along the entire Gotthard line with distances of up to 4 kilometres between them and were all numbered. From 1950 onward the track inspections didn't require as many inspections as before. Between Giubiasco and Rivera the railway watchamn then only had to perform such an inspection every other day. Their former watchman houses now remained unmanned and were subsequently used as holiday homes or private dwellings. From 1995 onward the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) turned to selling these watchman houses.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. The use of {{locking plate}} {{technology}} for anterior lumbar spinal fusion has increased {{stability of the}} vertebral fusion mass over traditional nonconstrained screw and plate systems. This case report outlines a complication due {{to the use of}} this construct. Case. A patient with a history of L 2 corpectomy and anterior spinal fusion presented with discitis at the L 4 / 5 level and underwent an anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) supplemented with a locking plate placed anterolaterally for stability. Fifteen months after the ALIF procedure, he returned with a hardware infection. He underwent debridement of the infection site and removal of hardware. Results. Once hardware was exposed, removal of the locking plate screws was only successful in one out of four screws using a reverse thread screw removal device. Three of the reverse thread screw removal devices broke in attempt to remove the subsequent <b>screws.</b> A metal <b>cutting</b> drill was then used to break hoop stresses associated with the locking device and the plate was removed. Conclusion. Anterior locking plates add significant stability to an anterior spinal fusion mass. However, removal of this hardware can be complicated by the inherent properties of the design with significant risk of major vascular injury...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} outcome of {{subtrochanteric}} hip fractu-res treated with proximal lateral femur locking plate. Method: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical results of 48 cases of femoral subtrochanteric fractures treated with proximal la-teral femur locking plates from January 2008 to May 2010. The progress of fracture healing, {{as well as the}} occurrence of complications, was recorded. The function of the hip joint was evaluated by the Harris social index and the Parker and Palmer mobility score one year after the operation. Result: 45 patients were followed up until fracture union or a revision surgery. Among the 45 patients, 43 patients obtained fracture union without further intervention. Thirty-eight fractures healed with no loss of position at 1 -year follow-up. There were no ca-ses of hip <b>screw</b> <b>cutting</b> through the femoral head. The mean score of the Harris social index was 86. 5 ± 9. 8 (73 ~ 95). The mean Parker and Palmer mobility score was 7. 4 ± 2. 1 (3 ~ 9). Conclusion: The proximal lateral femur locking plate is the kind of stable and effective internal fixation for treating sub-trochanteric hip fractures which has the advantage of stable fixation especially for the lateral femoral wall fracture.

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: Analyze the {{outcomes}} of proximal femoral locking compression plate (PF-LCP) in these complex fractures. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed 21 proximal femoral fractures treated with PF-LCP from June 2013 to February 2015. There were 15 females (71 %) and six males (29 %) {{with an average age}} of 61. 4 years (range: 34 - 80 years). The peritrochanteric fractures constituted by intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures were classified by the Boyd and Griffin classification and Seinshemier's classification, respectively. Among them, 16 cases (76 %) were of intertrochanteric and five cases (24 %) were of subtrochanteric fracture pattern. The functional outcome was assessed by Harris Hip Score and the Parker Palmer mobility score one year post-surgery. RESULTS: Among 21 patients, 19 patients obtained fracture union without further intervention; two patients required additional bone grafting. No cases of the hip <b>screw</b> <b>cutting</b> the femoral head were noted. There was no post-operative mortality in this study. The average Harris Hip Score was 84. 5 (range: 83 - 94). The assessment by Parker and Palmar mobility score was 7. 5 (range: 4 - 9). CONCLUSION: The PF-LCP is a good, stable alternative in the treatment of peritrochanteric femoral fractures. It provides good-to-excellent bone healing with reduced complications...|$|E
40|$|International audienceToday the {{development}} of collaborative work practices led to some evolutions of organizations, design process {{as well as the}} analysis of the roles of those process actors. The deployment of multi-view representations of the product during its life cycle also generates important needs for software tools, methods, and concepts in order to increase its effectiveness. Within this context firstly, a new product model for production is presented, based on the multi-view model. It consists of two parts. The first "graphic" part represents the structural description of the product. The second one "manufacturing activities and structural data" represents the manufacturing operations of the product. Secondly, a new approach to the control of manufacturing systems, which allows increased reactivity and flexibility is presented. This approach is based on a social approach with a totally decentralized architecture. The manufacturing system is made up of a set of autonomous and intelligent agents as in a society. The original contribution {{of this paper is to}} consider the product as an actor who takes a part in the decisions. The products are likened to customers and the resources to service providers. The model is inserted into a validation platform developed by the partners participating in the PSEDOS (Synchronous Production Between Clients and Subcontractors) project. This platform integrates all the elements necessary to drive the production, interacting with the computerised data exchanges between order-givers and subcontractors. It concerns a car industry company specialised in <b>screw</b> <b>cutting</b> and subcontracting, suppliers of car manufacturers...|$|E
