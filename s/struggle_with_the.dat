The Germans backed Gens' efforts to secure more power, and implied that he was not responsible to the Judenrat, and that the Judenrat had no power over Gens or the Jewish policemen.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese were {{actively}} involved in the foundation and growth of their Roman Catholic religious orders in Bombay. They called the islands by various names, which finally took the written form Bombaim. The islands were leased to several Portuguese officers during their regime. The Portuguese Franciscans and Jesuits built several churches in the city, prominent being the St. Michael's Church at Mahim, St. John the Baptist Church at Andheri, St. Andrew's Church at Bandra, and Gloria Church at Byculla. The Portuguese also built several fortifications around the city like the Bombay Castle, Castella de Aguada (Castelo da Aguada or Bandra Fort), and Madh Fort. The British were in constant <b>struggle</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese vying for hegemony over Bombay, as they recognized its strategic natural harbour and its natural isolation from land-attacks.|$|E

5|$|Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine (Wadzek's <b>Struggle</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Steam Turbine) is a 1918 comic {{novel by}} the German author Alfred D√∂blin. Set in Berlin, it narrates the futile and often {{delusional}} {{struggle of the}} eponymous industrialist Wadzek against Rommel, his more powerful competitor. In its narrative technique and its refusal to psychologize its characters, {{as well as in}} its vivid evocations of Berlin as a modern metropolis, Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine has been read as a precursor to D√∂blin's better-known 1929 novel Berlin Alexanderplatz.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, and returned the opening kickoff to its 19-yard line. In his opening drive, Seminoles quarterback Drew Weatherford completed several long passes, including a long 37-yard strike from his own 48-yard line to drive the Seminoles' offense inside the Virginia Tech red zone. Once there, however, the Florida State offense began to <b>struggle</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Tech defense, which had recovered somewhat from the initial shock of Weatherford's offensive success. On the three plays that followed Weatherford's 37-yard pass, Florida State managed only six positive yards, but this total was largely negated by a five-yard false start penalty that pushed FSU's offense backward. Facing a fourth down, Florida State coach Bobby Bowden sent in kicker Gary Cismesia to attempt a 31-yard field goal. The kick was successful, and the three points gave Florida State an early 30 lead with 11:06 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

Before the Halo jumps, Anders promises to get help from the UNSC as soon as possible. On the Ark, Atriox and a legion of Banished still live, preparing for the next fight against the UNSC. Meanwhile, the Halo carrying Anders drops out of slipspace prematurely, only to encounter a Foreunner construct known as a Guardian.|$|E
