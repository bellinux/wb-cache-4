It is my firm belief, as Director of the United States <b>Secret</b> <b>Service,</b> that using <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> protective personnel as witnesses concerning non-criminal activities of a President will substantially undermine, if not destroy, the relationship of trust and confidence that must exist between the <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> and the President in order for the <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> to successfully fulfill its mission.

50|$|The {{period of}} the HZDS rule was among other things marked by {{persistent}} animosity between the HZDS-led government and the country's President Michal Kováč, a vocal opponent of the Mečiar regime.

Crime rates in Slovakia soared in the 1990s, and the first post-communist gangsters emerged. At the time of the 1994-1998 Vladimír Mečiar's government, organized crime became well established in the country and it penetrated the highest political positions. An often cited example is the <b>Slovak</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> under Ivan Lexa and his deputy Jaroslav Svěchota.|$|E

Pittner famously characterized Szatmáry with the sentence: [...] "The witness committed crimes of the most serious nature".According to Szatmáry, the killing was ordered by Miroslav Sýkora (who in turn had an order from Ivan Lexa) who delegated the hit to Imrich Oláh. Jozef Roháč was supposed to provide the explosive device. Szatmáry testified that Oláh admitted the murder to him in the summer of 1998. Szatmáry later recalled his testimony by writing a letter to the Slovak police, claiming it was provided under pressure and after being promised various advantages in his own investigation.|$|E

However, after Kovač's term expired in March 1998 the Slovak parliament was unable to elect a successor, so Mečiar also temporarily {{assumed the role of}} acting president. As president, he issued an amnesty for some of those accused of the abduction. As a result, Slovakia under his rule became partially isolated from the West and the pace of EU and NATO accession negotiations was much slower than in the case of neighboring countries, although Mečiar supported both EU and NATO membership for his country and submitted Slovakia's applications to both organisations.|$|E
