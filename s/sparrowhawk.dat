5|$|The Eurasian <b>sparrowhawk</b> was {{described}} by Linnaeus in his 18th century work, Systema Naturae, as Falco nisus, but moved to its present genus by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The current scientific name {{is derived from the}} Latin accipiter, meaning 'hawk' and nisus, the <b>sparrowhawk.</b> According to Greek mythology, Nisus, the king of Megara, was turned into a <b>sparrowhawk</b> after his daughter, Scylla, cut off his purple lock of hair to present to her lover (and Nisus' enemy), Minos.|$|E
5|$|The musket, or musquet, {{originally}} {{a kind of}} crossbow bolt, and later a small cannon, was named after the male Eurasian <b>sparrowhawk</b> because of its size. The British Gloster Aircraft Company named one of their Mars series craft the <b>Sparrowhawk.</b>|$|E
5|$|Raptors: Buzzard; golden eagle; honey buzzard; kestrel; {{peregrine}} falcon; <b>sparrowhawk.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fauna include insects such as dark bush-crickets, {{white admiral}} and ringlet butterflies, and bird {{species such as}} <b>sparrowhawks,</b> tawny owls, great spotted {{woodpeckers}} and European green woodpeckers. Songbirds and <b>sparrowhawks</b> are popular sights.|$|R
40|$|Like British great tits, Belgian blue tits {{have a lower}} winter {{body mass}} when <b>sparrowhawks</b> are present. Since body mass affects {{manoeuvrability}} in small birds, tits may balance the risks of starvation {{and the risk of}} hawk predation by varying the amount of extra fat carried during winter. Predation pressure by <b>sparrowhawks</b> on young and inexperienced fledglings is at least as intense as that on the adults during winter. We therefore expected that tit fledgling body mass could also be reduced in the presence of <b>sparrowhawks.</b> In the years after one pair of <b>sparrowhawks</b> settled in a study plot, the mean body mass of blue tit fledglings was lower compared with that in years when there were no <b>sparrowhawks.</b> Furthermore, the shape of the curve relating juvenile survival to fledging mass changed, because the survival of the heaviest fledglings was reduced, which altered the selection differential of juvenile survival as a function of body mass from directional to stabilizing. Of seven published studies on the fledgling body mass–survival relation in tits, all three of the studies conducted in the absence of <b>sparrowhawks</b> showed the highest survival rates for the heaviest young, whereas in all four studies with <b>sparrowhawks</b> present this was no longer the case...|$|R
500|$|Male Eurasian <b>sparrowhawks</b> {{regularly}} kill birds {{weighing up}} to [...] and sometimes up to females can tackle prey up to [...] or more. The weight of food consumed by adult birds daily {{is estimated to}} be [...] for males and [...] for females. During one year, a pair of Eurasian <b>sparrowhawks</b> could take 2,200house sparrows, 600common blackbirds or 110wood pigeons. Species that feed in the open, far from cover, or are conspicuous by their behaviour or coloration, are taken more often by Eurasian <b>sparrowhawks.</b> For example, great tits and house sparrows are vulnerable to attack. Eurasian <b>sparrowhawks</b> may account for more than 50% of deaths in certain species, but the extent varies from area to area.|$|R
5|$|Within {{the family}} Accipitridae, the Eurasian <b>sparrowhawk</b> {{is a member}} of the large genus Accipiter, which {{consists}} of small to medium-sized woodland hawks. Most of the Old World members of the genus are called sparrowhawks or goshawks. The species' name dates back to the Middle English word sperhauk and Old English spearhafoc, a hawk which hunts sparrows. The Old Norse name for the Eurasian <b>sparrowhawk,</b> sparrhaukr, was thought to have been coined by Vikings who encountered falconry in England. English folk names for the Eurasian <b>sparrowhawk</b> include blue hawk, referring to the adult male's colouration, as well as hedge hawk, spar hawk, spur hawk and stone falcon.|$|E
5|$|Natural predators of the Eurasian <b>sparrowhawk</b> {{include the}} barn owl, the tawny owl, the {{northern}} goshawk, the peregrine falcon, the golden eagle, the eagle owl, the red fox, the stone marten and the pine marten.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the sixth}} {{edition of the}} AOU Checklist of North American Birds was {{published}} by the American Ornithologists' Union in 1983, {{the most commonly used}} name for the American kestrel was the sparrow hawk or <b>sparrowhawk.</b> This was due to a mistaken connection with the Eurasian <b>sparrowhawk</b> in the genus Accipiter. The sixth edition of the AOU Checklist corrected this, officially renaming the bird American kestrel. Several other colloquial names for the kestrel are also in use, including grasshopper hawk, due to its diet, and killy hawk, due to its distinct call.|$|E
50|$|Eurasian <b>sparrowhawks</b> are {{regularly}} observed.|$|R
25|$|In {{some areas}} such as Cape Peninsula, the <b>sparrowhawks</b> face habitat {{competition}} with Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiaca), an aggressive species known to steal the nests of the <b>sparrowhawks.</b> This results in a costly loss for the <b>sparrowhawks</b> after the time and energy spent building the nest and may also lead {{to the death of}} current offspring. However, <b>sparrowhawks</b> occasionally have more than 1 nest at a time, or they can readily build a new nest, so, in the event that one is usurped by an Egyptian goose, the pair will sometimes start breeding again in a nearby alternative nest; or they might wait until the geese have left the nest with their goslings, or they abandon breeding for that year.|$|R
50|$|Male Eurasian <b>sparrowhawks</b> {{regularly}} kill birds {{weighing up}} to 40 g and sometimes up to 120 g; females can tackle prey up to 500 g or more. The weight of food consumed by adult birds daily {{is estimated to}} be 40 - 50 g for males and 50 - 70 g for females. During one year, a pair of Eurasian <b>sparrowhawks</b> could take 2,200 house sparrows, 600 common blackbirds or 110 wood pigeons. Species that feed in the open, far from cover, or are conspicuous by their behaviour or coloration, are taken more often by Eurasian <b>sparrowhawks.</b> For example, great tits and house sparrows are vulnerable to attack. Eurasian <b>sparrowhawks</b> may account for more than 50% of deaths in certain species, but the extent varies from area to area.|$|R
5|$|According to the London Borough of Hillingdon, {{the most}} common species' of birds found within the woods are mute swan, Canada goose, robin, green woodpecker, jay, nuthatch, lesser spotted woodpecker, greater spotted woodpecker, cuckoo, <b>sparrowhawk,</b> tree creeper, tawny owl, willow tit and woodcock.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study found}} that the risk of {{predation}} for a bird targeted by a Eurasian <b>sparrowhawk</b> or northern goshawk increased 25-fold if the prey was infected with the blood parasite Leucocytozoon, and birds with avian malaria were 16 {{times more likely to be}} killed.|$|E
5|$|As well as smaller bird species, red wattlebirds can mob {{and chase}} larger {{species such as}} the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbirds and currawongs, the black-faced cuckooshrike (Coracina novaehollandiae), the olive-backed oriole (Oriolus sagittatus), crows and ravens, the {{laughing}} kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae) and even small raptors like the collared <b>sparrowhawk</b> (Accipiter cirrocephalus).|$|E

5|$|In Africa, Crex {{species may}} be hunted by the leopard, serval, cats, the black-headed heron, dark {{chanting}} goshawk, African hawk-eagle, Wahlberg's eagle, and black <b>sparrowhawk.</b> In South Africa, newly hatched African crake chicks {{were taken by}} a boomslang.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} is hunted by {{birds of prey}} {{including}} the Eurasian <b>sparrowhawk.</b> As {{with other members of}} its genus, it is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. Eggs laid by cuckoos that specialise in using pipits as their hosts are similar in appearance to those of the pipit.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian <b>sparrowhawk</b> {{population}} in Europe crashed {{in the second}} half of the 20th century. The decline coincided with the introduction of cyclodiene insecticides – aldrin, dieldrin and heptachlor – used as seed dressings in agriculture in 1956. The chemicals accumulated in the bodies of grain-eating birds and had two effects on top predators like the Eurasian <b>sparrowhawk</b> and peregrine falcon: the shells of eggs they laid were too thin, causing them to break during incubation; and birds were poisoned by lethal concentrations of the insecticides. Sub-lethal effects of these substances include irritability, convulsions and disorientation. In west Germany, around 80% of nests before the 1950s produced young, but only 54% were successful in the 1960s and '70s.|$|E

5|$|Body {{tissue samples}} from Eurasian <b>sparrowhawks</b> are still {{analysed}} {{as part of}} the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme conducted by the UK government's Joint Nature Conservation Committee. Although the average liver concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Eurasian <b>sparrowhawks</b> were lower in birds that died in 2005 compared to those that died in 2004, there was not a significant or consistent decline in residues between 2000–2005.|$|R
5|$|A study, using stuffed bird models, {{found that}} small birds {{are less likely}} to {{approach}} common cuckoos (a brood parasite) which have barred underparts like the Eurasian <b>sparrowhawk.</b> Eurasian reed warblers were found to be more aggressive to cuckoos which looked less hawk-like, meaning that the resemblance to the hawk helps the cuckoo to access the nests of potential hosts.|$|E
5|$|Across {{most of its}} European range, {{the most}} {{important}} predator of the Eurasian nuthatch is the <b>sparrowhawk.</b> Other species known to prey on this nuthatch include the northern goshawk, hobby, tawny owl, pygmy owl and least weasel. A Swedish study showed that 6.2% of the nuthatch nests in their study area were raided by predators. The perpetrators were not identified, but the main single predator of tit nests in the same study was the great spotted woodpecker.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eater nests may be raided by {{rats and}} snakes, and the adults are hunted by {{birds of prey}} such as the Levant <b>sparrowhawk.</b> The little {{bee-eater}} and red-throated bee-eaters are hosts of the greater honeyguide and the lesser honeyguide, both brood parasites. The young honeyguides kill the bee-eater's chicks and destroy any eggs. The begging call of the honeyguide sounds like two bee-eater chicks, ensuring a good supply of food from the adult bee-eaters.|$|E
5000|$|According to oral tradition, {{the site}} was {{occupied}} by a system of ruined Roman fortifications, which served as a refuge for <b>sparrowhawks</b> (sâf), whence it got the name [...] "Sparrowhawk Castle". This legend contains a note of truth because a text attests that the aristocracy of Mahdia, located twelve kilometres from Ksour Essef, was accustomed to hunt <b>sparrowhawks</b> {{in the region of}} Salakta and its environs.|$|R
5000|$|These <b>sparrowhawks</b> are grey {{with a white}} underbelly {{and orange}} accents on the neck. They are often {{characterized}} by their large feet. They are the only hawk in New Britain or the Solomon Islands that has a middle toe that is longer than the rest. [...] The feet of the New Britain <b>sparrowhawks</b> are pale yellow. These small birds only grow to be 27-34 cm long.|$|R
50|$|The bats are insectivorous, feeding {{mainly on}} beetles and moths. Predators include owls, <b>sparrowhawks,</b> and tree-climbing snakes.|$|R
5|$|Forty-two {{species of}} birds have been {{observed}} on the site, 25 of which are breeding there. Twenty-two species are protected nationally; five are listed on the annex OO of the Bonn Convention, which aims to conserve migratory species throughout their range. However, no species {{can be considered as}} heritage. The northern goshawk and Eurasian <b>sparrowhawk</b> benefit from the abundance of sparrows feeding. The common grasshopper warbler stops there during its migration and the common nightingale nests there occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Great spotted {{woodpeckers}} are hunted by woodland {{birds of}} prey such as the Eurasian <b>sparrowhawk</b> and the northern goshawk. This woodpecker is a host of the blood-feeding fly Carnus hemapterus, and its internal parasites may include the spiny-headed worm Prosthorhynchus transversus. Protozoans also occur, including the potentially fatal Toxoplasma gondii, which causes toxoplasmosis. The great spotted woodpecker is the favoured host of the tapeworm Anomotaenia brevis.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, for example, {{the species}} almost became extinct in East Anglia, where the {{chemicals}} were most widely used; in western and northern {{parts of the}} country, where the pesticides were not used, there were no declines. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds bought its Coombes Valley nature reserve in Staffordshire {{because it was the}} only Eurasian <b>sparrowhawk</b> breeding site left in the English Midlands.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} compare the two species’ flight {{performance}} over the exposed and windy Falsterbo Peninsula, where thermal conditions seldomly are very favorable, we used tracking radar to study flight parameters of <b>sparrowhawks</b> Accipiter nisus and common buzzards Buteo buteo during autumn migration. The results showed a clear difference between <b>sparrowhawks</b> and common buzzards in their flight altitudes and speeds, and in the wind conditions they encountered. Common buzzards had higher flight altitudes and were more selective of wind. Flight altitude was negatively related to the wind speed, which was most pronounced for common buzzards. <b>Sparrowhawks</b> had higher mean air- and cross-country speeds than common buzzards. Airspeed was negatively related, whereas ground and cross-country speeds were positively related to the tailwind component for both raptors. The differences between <b>sparrowhawks</b> and buzzards could {{to a large degree}} be explained by a larger dependence on thermal soaring among the common buzzards; a strategy associated with selectivity for favourable thermal and wind conditions during migratory flight. An additional important explanation for the interspecific differences was the habit of the <b>sparrowhawks</b> to combine migratory flight with hunting for prey, which makes it prone to fly at lower altitudes and use flapping flight to a much larger degree than common buzzards which do not forage during their migratory passage of the Falsterbo Peninsula...|$|R
5|$|The Eurasian <b>sparrowhawk's</b> pale underparts {{and darker}} upperparts are {{an example of}} countershading, which helps {{to break up the}} bird's outline. Countershading is {{exhibited}} by birds of prey which hunt birds and other fast-moving animals. The horizontal barring seen on adult Eurasian <b>sparrowhawks</b> is typical of woodland-dwelling predatory birds, while the adult male's bluish colour is also seen in other bird-eating raptors, including the peregrine falcon, the merlin and other Accipiters.|$|R
