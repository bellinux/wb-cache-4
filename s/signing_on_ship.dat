With these {{drawings}} he was accepted, in 1933, as a student at Valand School of Fine Arts in Gothenburg. The teacher Sigfrid Ullman (1886–1960) early discovered Torsten Billman. Under Sigfrid Ullman's direction he was able to work according to his own intuition, and here he came on an even keel again. Torsten Billman left Valand 1934, after only three terms.|$|R
5|$|The Red Star Line changed Kroonland from American to Belgian {{registry}} on 6 November 1908 in Antwerp. One reason {{given for}} the change was to allow Red Star to hire non-American crews at lower cost. She made her maiden voyage under the Belgian flag the next day. In May 1911, Kroonlands crew, acting on rumors of an impending British mariner's strike, refused to <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> for the <b>ship's</b> next voyage, forcing Red Star to hire a replacement crew.|$|R

5000|$|The Admiralty rated Bounty as a cutter, the {{smallest}} category of warship—this {{meant that she}} was commanded not by a captain but by a lieutenant, with no other commissioned officers aboard, and without the usual detachment of Royal Marines that ships commanders could use to enforce their authority.

The other warrant officers were the boatswain, the surgeon, the carpenter, and the gunner. Two masters mates and two midshipmen were rated as petty officers; to these were added several honorary midshipmen—so-called [...] "young gentlemen" [...] who aspired to naval careers.

In Rio de Janeiro, he jumped ship, found a job and got engaged to the boss's daughter. His father tracked him down and persuaded him to go to the University of Michigan, but Elstob failed his freshman's year and got into trouble with the police. He was then sent to England with instructions to join the army. A letter of introduction to a friend of his father's led to a short service commission in the RAF.|$|R

50|$|British {{expeditions to}} protect British Indian trade and {{interests}} around Ras al-Khaimah, {{close to the}} Strait of Hormuz, led to campaigns against that headquarters and other harbours along the coast, principally in 1809 but then again in 1819. The next year, 1820, a peace treaty was signed to which all the sheikhs of the coast adhered. The signatories to that treaty included Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi of Sharjah (on 6 January 1820. He signed a 'preliminary agreement' also on behalf of Ajman and Umm Al Qawain), and then on 8 January at Ras Al Khaimah, Hasan bin Rahmah Al Qasimi of Ras Al Khaimah signed as did Hassan Bin Rahma as Sheikh of 'Hatt and Fahleia' (presumably modern Khatt) formerly of Ras Al Khaimah, followed on 10 January by Qadib bin Ahmad of Jazirah Al Hamrah (given in the treaty's English translation as 'Jourat Al Kamra'!) <b>signed.</b> <b>On</b> 11 January 1820, again at Ras Al Khaimah, Shakhbut bin Diyab Al Nahyan <b>signed</b> <b>on</b> behalf of his son, Tahnoon, the Sheikh of the Bani Yas and Ruler of Abu Dhabi.

25|$|Social {{security}} was seriously {{threatened by the}} periodic disbandment of the military forces, a common situation {{at the conclusion of}} wars that led to hundreds of soldiers and sailors rambling around the streets of London without an occupation or a decent living arrangement. Periods of peace were commonly marked by an increase of violent crimes. In a post-war London competition for a job was fierce and the criminality rate for robbery and property crime rose alarmingly. Although sailors could eventually <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> some merchant <b>ships,</b> soldiers had not such prospects. Moreover, at the moment of their dismissal, cavalrymen had the possibility to keep their horses, having paid for them with their allowances. Adding their experience with weapons and their acquaintance with accomplices in a similar position, there were all the perfect premises for the rising of gangs of robbers and criminal alliances.|$|R
