5|$|In June 1914, Bosnian Serb student Gavrilo Princip assassinates Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, {{setting of}} {{a chain of events}} that lead to the {{outbreak}} of World War I. Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia, and the local authorities begin to incite Višegrad's non-Serb population against the town's Serb residents. The bridge with the old road to Sarajevo suddenly regains its importance, as the railway line is not adequate to transport all the materiel and <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> preparing to attack Serbia in the autumn of 1914. Austria-Hungary's invasion is swiftly repulsed and the Serbians advance across the Drina, prompting the Austro-Hungarians to evacuate Višegrad and destroy portions of the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} the alien {{substance}} Terrigen was released into the ecosystem, Joey Gutierrez developed metal-melting abilities. Unable to control this power, Gutierrez is confronted in the streets by <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> willing to use lethal force to detain him. Gutierrez is saved by S.H.I.E.L.D., and Inhuman agent Daisy Johnson attempts {{to explain to him}} that he is also an Inhuman, with a dormant gene within him that was activated by the Terrigen. Struggling to help Gutierrez accept what has happened to him, Johnson seeks the help of Lincoln Campbell, the Inhuman who helped her transition but has now renounced the ways of the Inhumans, wishing to live a normal life.|$|E
5|$|Upon the brigade's {{arrival at}} G.H.Q., The Lieutenant is {{informed}} by General Victor and his adjutant Colonel Smythe that he is to be reassigned and will be stripped of his command. He is confined to his quarters and is told his entire brigade will be broken apart and assimilated into another brigade. Meanwhile, in the barracks at G.H.Q., the Fourth Brigade learns of crucial news through back channels: a vaccine exists for the soldier's sickness, and General Victor’s plans for their brigade. The men decide to rebel, and break through the defenses of the barracks, free The Lieutenant and kill Captain Malcolm. The Fourth Brigade successfully escapes G.H.Q. in France and begins {{to make their way}} to London, along with other <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> dissatisfied with General Victor's command. A battle ensues between General Victor's men and The Lieutenant's troops. The Lieutenant and his expanded Fourth Brigade eventually successfully take control of London and subsequently all of England and Wales.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{most of the}} <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> {{fought in}} the American Civil War were volunteers, both sides by 1862 resorted to conscription, {{primarily}} {{as a means to}} force men to register and to volunteer. [...] In the absence of exact records, estimates of the percentage of Confederate <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> draftees are about double the 6 percent of Union <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> conscripts.|$|R

25|$|According to Israeli figures, between 6 June 1982 and June 1985, the Israel Defense Forces {{suffered}} 657 {{dead and}} 3,887 wounded.

25|$|Some Protestant US {{military}} chaplains {{carry the}} Roman Rite {{version of the}} Anointing of the Sick with them for use if called upon to assist wounded or dying <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> Catholics. The Catholic and Orthodox Churches consider invalid as a sacrament the administration of Anointing of the Sick by such chaplains, who {{in the eyes of}} those Churches are not validly ordained priests. The rite performed by them is thus seen as having the same by no means negligible value of any other form of prayer offered for the sick or dying.|$|E
25|$|Many {{ceremonies and}} rituals of the Canadian Forces have a royal connection. For example, the {{military}} traditionally mounts {{what is known}} as the Queen's Guard (or King's Guard during the reign of a male monarch), which is made up of contingents of infantry and cavalry <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> charged with guarding the royal residences in Canada and the United Kingdom. Canada has mounted the King's/Queen's Guard eight times since 1916, including Canadian Coronation Contingents for King George VI in May 1937 and for Queen Elizabeth II in May 1953. Also, whenever the sovereign or a member of her family is in Ottawa, they will lay a wreath at the National War Memorial (which itself was dedicated in 1939 by King George VI) and will do the same if at a Canadian war monument overseas.|$|E
25|$|At a camp, a British captain asks Mizushima to {{talk down}} {{a group of}} <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> still {{fighting}} on a mountain. He agrees {{to do so and}} is told by the captain that he has 30 minutes to convince them to surrender. At the mountain, he is almost shot by the hold-out soldiers before they realize he is Japanese. He climbs up to the cave and informs their commander that the war has ended and they should surrender. The commander confers with the other soldiers, and they unanimously decide to fight to the end. Mizushima begs for them to surrender but they do nothing. He decides to ask for more time from the British, but when he creates a surrender flag, the others take it the wrong way and believe he is surrendering for them. They beat him unconscious and leave him on the floor. The cave is bombarded and Mizushima is the only survivor.|$|E

[...] When the army holds {{maneuvers}} near her home town, the factory supervisor organizes a mixer for the largely female workforce and the all-male soldiers. [...] This dance proves a mixed success, with many of the <b>soldiers,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> middle-aged reservists, and many of the factory workers, who are inexperienced young women with idealized views of romance, being confused by and disappointed with their potential dancing partners. The film's protagonist, though, does meet an attractive young man who plays in the dance band and has a one-night fling with him. When she travels to the capital city where he lives in order to resume their romance, she meets his parents and comes to the realization that there is no future in this relationship.|$|E

She finds Vellaiyathevan's corpse and, overcome by grief, dies on it. Bannerman's troops attack Panchalankurichi with heavy artillery and Kattabomman's army suffers badly.

500|$|Certain {{characters}} have seemingly supernatural abilities {{from the beginning}} of the series. Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin Crowe not only have common visions of two soldiers (one of them also appearing in a tuxedo) and a man with a tattooed tree on his chest, but also of each other. Ben can heal and resurrect beings at the cost of others' life, while Brother Justin can read and manipulate people's minds. Ben and Lodz, a blind mentalist of the carnival, experience visions of the medieval Knights Templar. Carnival fortuneteller Sofie can communicate telepathically with her catatonic mother, whom she once sees being raped by the Tattooed Man. The progressing story increases the importance of the two mysterious <b>soldiers,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> revealed as Henry Scudder and Management. Strange words of unknown meaning appear throughout the series. Variations of the phrase [...] "Every Prophet in his House" [...] are repeated, seemingly without context. Ben finds the repeating letter string TARAVATARAVA in a mineshaft, which he is later able to interpret as Avatar. Season 2 introduces the word Usher in particular relation to Brother Justin. Management repeats this term to Ben in two instances. After Management's death, Ben has sudden knowledge about Princes, Prophets and the Usher, even knowing to whom these terms apply, respectively. The sentence [...] "Sofie is the Omega" [...] is seen once, written across a mirror without further explanation. Sofie demonstrates powers and attributes similar to those of Ben and Brother Justin in the last Carnivàle episode.|$|E
