40|$|Abstract: The {{conventional}} view is {{that alcohol}} metabolism is carried out by ADH 1 (Class I) in the liver. However, {{it has been suggested}} that another pathway plays an important role in alcohol metabolism, especially when the level of blood ethanol is high or when drinking is chronic. Over the past three decades, vigorous attempts to identify the enzyme responsible for the non-ADH 1 pathway have focused on the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS) and catalase, but have failed to clarify their roles in <b>systemic</b> alcohol <b>metabolism.</b> Recently, using ADH 3 -null mutant mice, we demonstrated that ADH 3 (Class III), which has a high Km and is a ubiquitous enzyme of ancient origin, contributes to <b>systemic</b> alcohol <b>metabolism</b> in a dose-dependent manner, thereby diminishing acute alcohol intoxication. Although the activity of ADH 3 toward ethanol is usually low in vitro due to its very high Km, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) is markedly enhanced when the solution hydrophobicity of the reaction medium increases. Activation of ADH 3 by increasing hydrophobicity should also occur in liver cells; a cytoplasmic solution of mouse liver cells was shown to be much more hydrophobic than a buffer solution when using Nile red as a hydrophobicity probe.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Obesity is a {{systemic}} disorder {{associated with an}} increase in left ventricular mass and premature death and disability from cardiovascular disease. Although bariatric surgery reverses many of the hormonal and hemodynamic derangements, the long-term collective effects on body composition and left ventricular mass have not been considered before. We hypothesized that the decrease in fat mass and lean mass after weight loss surgery is associated with a decrease in left ventricular mass. METHODS: Fifteen severely obese women (mean body mass index [BMI]: 46. 7 +/- 1. 7 kg/m(2)) with medically controlled hypertension underwent bariatric surgery. Left ventricular mass and plasma markers of <b>systemic</b> <b>metabolism,</b> together with body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumferences, body composition (fat mass and lean mass), and resting energy expenditure were measured at 0, 3, 9, 12, and 24 months. RESULTS: Left ventricular mass continued to decrease linearly over the entire period of observation, while rates of weight loss, loss of lean mass, loss of fat mass, and resting energy expenditure all plateaued at 9 [corrected] months (P 3 ̆c. 001 for all). Parameters of <b>systemic</b> <b>metabolism</b> normalized by 9 months, and showed no further change at 24 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Even though parameters of obesity, including BMI and body composition, plateau, the benefits of bariatric surgery on <b>systemic</b> <b>metabolism</b> and left ventricular mass are sustained.

Over the past three decades, attempts to identify the metabolizing enzymes responsible for the ADH 1 -independent pathway have focused on the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS) and catalase, but have failed to clarify their roles in <b>systemic</b> alcohol <b>metabolism.</b> In this study, we used Adh 3 -null mutant mice to demonstrate that Class III ADH (ADH 3), a ubiquitous enzyme of ancient origin, contributes to alcohol metabolism in vivo dose-dependently resulting in a diminution of acute alcohol intoxication. Although the ethanol oxidation activity of ADH 3 in vitro is low due to its very high Km, it was found to exhibit a markedly enhanced catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) toward ethanol when the solution hydrophobicity of the reaction medium was increased with a hydrophobic substance. Confocal laser scanning microscopy with Nile red as a hydrophobic probe revealed a cytoplasmic solution of mouse liver cells to be much more hydrophobic than the buffer solution used for in vitro experiments. So, the in vivo contribution of high-Km ADH 3 to alcohol metabolism is likely to involve activation in a hydrophobic solution.

Recent studies indicate that there are continuous relationships between <b>systemic</b> calcium <b>metabolism</b> and BP, as over the whole range of normal and raised BPs there is an inverse correlation between plasma ionised calcium concentration and BP. Twenty-two subjects with normal or moderately elevated BP participated in the present study, undertaken to investigate the interactions between <b>systemic</b> calcium <b>metabolism</b> and BP during a two-hour constant-rate calcium infusion in the absence and in the presence of concomitant verapamil infusion. During the infusion there was an increase in plasma ionised calcium by 0. 40 mmol/l, SBP rose by 14 mmHg, and DBP by 9. 7 mmHg. Higher basal plasma ionised calcium and lower basal serum parathyroid hormone concentrations were associated with a more pronounced diastolic pressor response to the calcium infusion. A greater DBP increase was also accompanied by more pronounced parathyroid hormone suppression, determined as cyclic adenosine monophosphate excretion, and greater tissue uptake of calcium during the infusion. Conversely, higher basal BPs were associated with greater tissue calcium uptake during the infusions. This relationship was abolished when verapamil was present.

Emerging links between inflammation and metabolic disease progression suggest that PPAR and LXR signaling may alter macrophage function and thereby impact <b>systemic</b> <b>metabolism.</b> In this study, the function of macrophage PPAR and LXR in Th 1 -biased C 57 BL/ 6 mice was tested using a bone marrow transplantation approach with PPARγ−/−, PPARδ−/−, PPARγδ−/−, and LXRαβ−/− cells. Despite their inhibitory effects on inflammatory gene expression, loss of PPARs or LXRs in macrophages did not exert major effects on obesity or glucose tolerance induced by a high-fat diet. Treatment with rosiglitazone effectively improved glucose tolerance in mice lacking macrophage PPARγ, suggesting that cell types other than macrophages are the primary mediators of the anti-diabetic effects of PPARγ agonists in our model system.
