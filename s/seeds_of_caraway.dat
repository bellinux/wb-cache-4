40|$|The <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>caraway</b> (Carum carvi L.), {{a potent}} {{medicinal}} plant, are traditionally used for inducing weight loss. In this study, the anti-obesity properties of caraway aqueous extract (CAE) at 30 mL/day are examined in a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study. At baseline, seventy overweight and obese, healthy, aerobic-trained, women {{were randomly assigned}} to two groups (n= 35 per group). After 12 weeks, the CAE group, compared with placebo, showed a significant decrease in weight, body mass index, body fat percentage, and anthropometric indices. No changes were detected in the clinical and para-clinical assessments of participants. The findings show that dietary CAE with no limit in diet, when combined with physical activity, is of value in the treatment of obesity in women, lowering their weight, BMI, body fat percentage, and body size, and has no negative clinical effects.

Total dry weight (g/l) after 10 days {{of the growth of}} A. fumigatus in YES medium with 0. 5 % of mint decreased by about 95 %, A. flavus by 97 % and A. ochraceus by about 82 %. Addition of higher concentrations of mint (1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0 %) reduced the growth of all tested species. It was poor and hardly visible. pH values of the media increased with the increase of mint concentrations. A. fumigatus showed the highest sensitivity towards caraway and A. flavus the lowest.

30|$|Many {{different}} {{factors have}} essential effects on yield and chemical compositions <b>of</b> <b>caraway</b> essential oil.

30|$|The {{review article}} {{has a deep}} view on caraway fruits as famous {{medicinal}} plants in different pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic industries. Caraway fruits are used in different traditional systems as curative plants for management of different ailments, especially for management of digestive disorders. In traditional medicine, the galactagogue and carminative effects <b>of</b> <b>caraway</b> fruits are superior to other biological effects. Although, traditional scholars use caraway fruits as appetizer in foods, but caraway fruits or its water are one important ingredient of anti-obesity drugs in Unani traditional medicine [93]. There are two parallel clinical trials, which confirmed the anti-obesity effects [78, 80] <b>of</b> <b>caraway</b> water (Zeereh-Aragh) in comparison with placebo. Caraway reduces the plasma triglycerides and cholesterol levels in normal and streptozotocin rats [65] and also it enhances T 3 and T 4 levels. All above mechanisms along with its decreasing effect on TSH [77], are proposed the activation of metabolism in the body. The important role <b>of</b> <b>caraway</b> oil in management of functional dyspepsia has been confirmed in many clinical studies, but caraway oil always is used in combination with peppermint oil or menthol in enteric coated pills [85, 86]. The topical use <b>of</b> <b>caraway</b> oil around the abdomen has relieved the IBS symptoms in patient [87]. Although, the use <b>of</b> <b>caraway</b> oil is not recommended for adults under 18  days due to insufficient data, {{but it can be}} topically used as anti-colic and carminative agent for children or infantile. Although, caraway fruits are used for treatment of many human disorders according to traditional believes, the antiepileptic, anti-inflammatory, galactagogue effects <b>of</b> <b>caraway</b> oil have been confirmed in pre-clinical studies. Due to the high yield of essential oil, the use <b>of</b> <b>caraway</b> oil as antioxidant [50, 59] and preservatives [94] in food industries are recommended. Caraway could act as bioenhancers [49, 95]. Evaluating the safety of topical creams as abdominal pain reliever in children should be considered. The anti-aflatoxigenic, antioxidant and antimicrobial effects <b>of</b> <b>caraway</b> oil along with its reputation as spice help the industries to use it as natural preservatives and antioxidant agents instead of synthetic ones.|$|R
