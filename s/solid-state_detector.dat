The energy resolution of the CdTe <b>solid-state</b> <b>detector</b> {{is good enough to}} distinguish the photopeaks of Tc- 99 m (141  keV) and I- 123 (159  keV) (Fig.  1). This enables the scanner to provide an I- 123 image without Tc- 99 m contamination in simultaneous dual-radionuclide imaging. Therefore, the I- 123 images provided by the CdTe-SPECT are reliable even without crosstalk correction for both simultaneous and sequential Tc- 99 m and I- 123 scanning on the same day. This is advantageous for using a simple scatter and crosstalk correction method like our five energy window method (FiveEW method). The CdTe <b>solid-state</b> <b>detector</b> also provides a stable energy spectrum.

The peculiar features of these detectors, like very high spatial resolution (standard 250 nm) across a large field of view (> 1 cm 2), wide dynamic range (> 103), versatility and easiness of use combined with the high sensitivity of the optical fluorescence microscopy reading technique, make them very attractive as recording plates for X-ray imaging. High-resolution X-ray images of a metallic test pattern were recorded and acquired with good contrast both in LiF crystals and thin LiF films. The stored CCs fluorescence images show edge-enhancement effects ascribable to diffraction processes occurring during the X-ray beam propagation after its interaction with the samples.

40|$|For {{the first}} time we have {{fabricated}} a high granularity micropattern <b>solid-state</b> <b>detector</b> (MSSD) with the unipolar time-differential property for ultrafast pulse response. Optical, x-ray, and gamma-ray photoconductivity measurements prove the unipolar time-differential response with a speed improvement factor of ~ 400 for amorphous selenium MSSD. The significance of the results presented here is the ability to reach the intrinsic physical limit for detector pulse speed by transitioning from the transit-time-limited response, which depends on the bulk carrier transport mechanism, to range-limited response set by the spatial dispersion of the photo-induced carrier cloud. Furthermore, the combination of the time-differential and the avalanche-multiplication properties of the proposed micropattern <b>solid-state</b> <b>detector</b> can yield another great leap forward in the field of radiation detectors with applications ranging from high-energy, nuclear, and astro- physics, to industrial and medical diagnostics, and crystallography.

The energy dependence and the linearity in signal response with kerma in air were examined, and the detector was exposed to both X-ray beams using a conventional X-ray unit with effective photon energies ranging between 28. 5 and 48. 9 keV and to gamma rays 1. 17 and 1. 33 MeV from (60) Co. The R 100 exhibited ∼ 1. 7 times over-response at the lowest X-ray energy relative to the (60) Co source. The detector demonstrated a linear response (R(2) = 1) when irradiated with (60) Co to air kerma values in the range of 20 - 200 mGy.
