Originally a <b>special</b> purpose uniprocessor <b>executor,</b> the coshell {{has evolved into a}} general purpose service that {{automatically}} executes shell actions on lightly loaded hosts in a local network. A major thrust of this work has been ease of use. The only privilege required for installation, administration or use is rsh access to the local hosts. nmake and GNU-make users can take advantage of network execution with no makefile modifications. Shell level access is similar to but more efficient than rsh and allows host expression matching to replace the explicit host name argument. Also provided is a C programming library interface with five primitive operations that follow the forkexec -wait process model. Beside the speedups attained by parallelizing computations in a homogeneous network, coshell also supports heterogeneous configurations.

Beside the speedups attained by parallelizing computations in a homogeneous network, coshell also supports heterogeneous configurations. This presents novel solutions to traditional cross-compilation problems. It also allows the user to view a new network host as a compute engine rather than yet another architecture on which to port the home environment and tools. coshell runs on most S 5 R 4 and BSD UNIX * operating system variants. ...|$|R
