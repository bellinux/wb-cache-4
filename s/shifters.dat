5|$|The story then {{shifts to}} four years later, where Marley forces {{including}} Titan <b>Shifters</b> like Zeke and Reiner, as well as warriors in training to inherit their powers are fighting against another nation called the Mid-East Allied Forces. Though Marley wins the war, they are devastated by the new invention of Anti-Titan artillery which can seriously harm and even kill the most well fortified Titan <b>Shifters.</b> Thus Zeke tells Marley military command that they must once again attempt to steal Eren's Coordinate power or Marley's position as a world hegemony will cease. As the Marleyan military prepares for another attempt to invade Paradis, Eren infiltrates the country by assuming the disguise of a wounded and amputated soldier named Mr. Kruger who uses Falco Grice, one of the prospective warriors who desire to inherit the Armored Titan to gain information. The Tyburs, an influential and highly-respected political clan led by Willy who is the current holder of the War Hammer Titan, secretly control the Marley government and decide to assist the warriors for the imminent invasion of Paradis.|$|E

However, they also discover that their race, the Eldians, are being oppressed and persecuted by the Marleyans, the ruling race that {{with the objective of}} conquering their island, Paradis, and seizing their natural resources, have transformed Eldian prisoners into rogue Titans to keep them trapped inside the walls and sent Zeke, Annie, and the other Titan <b>Shifters</b> to steal the Coordinate. In the occasion, Eren also learns that Zeke is his older half-brother, who betrayed their father and defected to the Marleyans. After Wall Maria is reclaimed, Eren and the others make preparations for their imminent confrontation with the Marleyan forces.|$|E

40|$|A new active LO phase <b>shifter</b> was {{introduced}} and implemented in a 2 x 2 wide band MIMO receiver. The chip was designed with STMicroelectronics 90 nm technology. The main {{advantages of the}} proposed phase <b>shifter</b> over previous works included a wide band range, high resolution and small area. The phase <b>shifter</b> {{is based on the}} dependency of the inverter propagation delay on the load capacitance. Simply, by changing the load capacitance of an inverter, a different propagation delay is generated. A number of these controllable delay cells are cascaded to provide the required phase-shift. In order for the delay cells to reduce the required amount of phase-shifting the I&Q swap circuit is introduced. The I&Q swap circuitry reduces the phase-shifting by one fourth of the original range. The wide band phase <b>shifter</b> is suitable for multi-standard radios, since just one phase <b>shifter</b> is needed to support all standards. This capability of the phase <b>shifter</b> could potentially reduce the size of the die and simplify the design. The measurement shows that the phase <b>shifter</b> is able to provide 360 ˚ of phase-shifting at the output base band signal when the LO is varying from 1. 5 GHz to 6 GHz. A wider range of the phase <b>shifter</b> is achievable by reducing the capacitance load and increasing the number of cascaded delay cells. The proposed phase <b>shifter</b> is capable of achieving a very high resolution. The resolution of the phase <b>shifter</b> {{is a function of the}} inverter current capability and the load capacitance. The measurements show the average resolution of the proposed phase <b>shifter</b> is about 1. 32 ps. Passive components usually take up a large area on the chip. A MOS capacitor is used as the load to reduce the area of the proposed phase <b>shifter.</b> A method is proposed to improve the phase <b>shifter</b> stability over the temperature and process variations. This method is based on the fact that the propagation delay of an inverter is inversely proportional to the power supply. Therefore, the phase shifters’ power supply must be varied to maintain a relatively constant phase <b>shifter</b> resolution over the temperature and process variations...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that many improvements concerning resolution and focus latitude {{can be obtained}} by the use of phase-shifting masks. Different phase-shifting mask designs are proposed already, {{and one of the most}} suitable designs for periodical structures is the alternated <b>shifter</b> design. If such phase-shifting masks are investigated, it is assumed that all <b>shifter</b> parameters are ideal. A major problem, however, is the production of such an ideal phase-shifting mask with perfect <b>shifter</b> parameters. In this work, the influence of <b>shifter</b> parameters such as transparency, thickness, and sidewall slope are studied for the alternated phase-shifting design. The investigation is carried out by simulations and by experiments, and for various coherence factors. It is found that all <b>shifter</b> deviations cause linewidth differences between <b>shifter</b> and quartz lines, often resulting in a reduced depth-of-focus (DOF). Especially if various deviations occur simultaniously, the DOF reductions are important, putting stringent demands on mask processing in order to obtain tolerable <b>shifter</b> deviations. In order to print L/S down to 0. 3 mum with reasonable DOF for production applications, the <b>shifter</b> transparency and thickness should not deviate more than 5 % from their ideal values...|$|R
