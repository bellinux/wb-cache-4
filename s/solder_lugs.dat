50|$|A {{battery holder}} {{is either a}} plastic case with {{the shape of the}} housing molded as a {{compartment}} or compartments that accepts a battery or batteries, or a separate plastic holder that is mounted with screws, eyelets, glue, double-sided tape, or other means. Battery holders may have a lid to retain and protect the batteries, or may be sealed to prevent damage to circuitry and components from battery leakage. Coiled spring wire or flat tabs that press against the battery terminals are the two most common methods of making the electrical connection inside a holder. External connections on battery holders are usually made by contacts with pins, surface mount feet, <b>solder</b> <b>lugs,</b> or wire leads.|$|E

5000|$|William Holme Twentyman (31 October 1802 - 7 May 1884) was a {{silversmith}} in Cape Town, who {{amassed a}} considerable fortune on Mauritius and retired {{at the age}} of 39. Whilst on Mauritius he created a sealed case for a pocket watch to be worn under water. After trials <b>soldered</b> <b>lugs</b> were incorporated and a [...] "strong canvas" [...] band was tied to the wrist for ease of use. Twentyman also painted the dial orange as to be more clearly seen underwater. This creation was known as the Twentyman [...] "orange gorilla" [...] due to its large size.|$|R
50|$|Tube sockets were {{typically}} mounted in holes {{on a sheet}} metal chassis and wires or other components were hand <b>soldered</b> to <b>lugs</b> {{on the underside of}} the socket. In the 1950s, printed circuit boards were introduced and tube sockets were developed whose contacts could be soldered directly to the printed wiring tracks. Looking at the bottom of a socket, or, equivalently, a tube from its bottom, the pins were numbered clockwise, starting at an index notch or gap, a convention that has persisted into the integrated circuit era.|$|R
40|$|Many {{of us have}} {{constructed}} the front panel and chassis for crystal radio sets using 1 / 8 th-inch hardboard, purchased at Lowes, Ace, or Home Depot. This board is inexpensive, easy to saw, drill, and punch, and the resulting sets have worked satisfactorily. At the same time, many are aware, starting with the DX contesters, that using low-loss sheet plastic can boost performance when working with high impedance sets. The resistive losses in hardboard are hinted at in the experiments outlined below. Two measurements schemes were taken, using an 8 ” by 7 ” by 1 / 8 th inch piece of hardboard, shown in Figure 1. The <b>solder</b> <b>lug</b> terminals were – arbitrarily- spaced 3 inches apart. While the first scheme used {{was found to be}} incorrect, I’ll described it anyway, {{as an example of how}} one can go astray when “assuming ” a circuit model and ignoring part of the data obtained. Figure 2 denotes this first test circuit, consisting of a B&K signal generator, a 1 Meg ohm resistor, the resistance of the hardboard between terminals, and a two-channel scope (not shown). Assuming the circuit model was correct, the generator output was attached to channel 1 of the scope and the output of the voltage divider – between R 1 and the hardboard resistor – was attached to channel 2. Knowing the generator voltage, V 1, Vout, and R 1, R of the hardboard connections could be calculated: 1...|$|R
50|$|Military {{wristwatches}} {{are believed}} to have received their name from a German military request for a soldier in a watch house, otherwise known as a guard tower. One story tells that the military wristwatches came into use when a German naval officer needed to know the time but could not pull out a pocket watch since both his hands were busy operating the machine. Another story is that Wilhelm I placed an order at a Berlin trade show. These new wrist watches saw their first action in the Boer War. Later seen in World War I, rudimentary wrist watches were small sized pocket watches with metal <b>lugs</b> <b>soldered</b> on so that a fabric strap could hold the watch to a wrist. Some had no cover over the watch crystal, while others had a metal cover, some of these had pieces of the cover cut, so that the watch could be seen without opening the cover.|$|R
