40|$|Flatfishes {{have been}} the subject of {{scientific}} research since the beginning of the 19 th century but information on the specific habitat requirement of the adult life stages is largely anecdotal. Detailed knowledge of flatfish habitats however is a precondition for a more ecosystem orientated approach to fisheries management. Here the association between benthic habitat and the adult life stage of three flatfish species plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), sole (Solea solea) and <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> (Microstomus kitt) was investigated in the English Channel. Data from groundfish surveys spanning a period of 9 years was used to identify three distinct site groups: sites where a species occurred in consistently high abundances, sites of variable or low abundance and sites at which none were caught. Following the supposition of habitat selection theories such as the ideal free distribution theory these three sites groups should represent a gradient in habitat suitability from highly suitable to less suitable and unsuitable respectively. Habitat parameters and features for the three site groups and species were described and analysed. In particular sediment type and the importance of structuring epifauna for adult flatfish was investigated. Overall plaice and sole showed very similar trends for abiotic environmental parameters such as depth, temperature, salinity and tidal currents. <b>Lemon</b> <b>sole</b> was found over distinctly different habitats which may indicate a stronger niche partitioning of this species. Sediment associations differed between the three species with plaice predominantly occurring over sandy substrates with little mud and gravel content, while sole was found over a wider range of muddy to sandy substrates. <b>Lemon</b> <b>sole</b> was predominantly found over sand however containing a higher percentage of gravel than plaice. Structuring emergent epifauna was related positively to plaice and <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> abundances. These structures might be important as they tend to harbour larger numbers of epibenthic species upon which adult plaice and <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> prey. No such trend was found for the tactile feeding sole which mainly forages on infaunal polychaetes and molluscs...|$|R

40|$|The age, growth, {{maturity}} and population dynamics of <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> (Microstomus kitt), captured off {{the west coast}} of Ireland (ICES division Vllb), were determined for the period November 2000 to February 2002. The maximum age recorded was 14 years. Males of the population were dominated by 4 year olds, while females were dominated by 5 year olds. Females dominated the sex ratio in the overall sample, each month sampled, at each age and from 22 cm in total length onwards (when N > 20). Possible reasons for the dominance of females in the sex ratio are discussed. Three models were used to obtain the parameters of the von Bertalanfly growth equation. These were the Ford-Walford plot (Beverton and Holt 1957), the Gulland and Holt plot (1959) and the Rafail (1973) method. Results of the fitted von Bertalanffy growth curves showed that female <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> o f f {{the west coast of}} Ireland grew faster than males and attained a greater size. Male and female <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> mature from 2 years of age onwards. There is evidence in the population o f a smaller asymptotic length (L«, = 34. 47 cm), faster growth rate (K = 0. 1955) and younger age at first maturity, all of which are indicative o f a decrease in population size, when present results are compared to data collected in the same area 22 years earlier. Results of the yield per recruit curve indicate that <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> are currently being over-fished o f f the west coast of Ireland.

40|$|Fish stock {{identification}} and stock assessment are {{fundamental to the}} science underpinning contemporary fisheries management. Although of considerable economic importance to fisheries in South-west Britain, {{little research has been}} undertaken into the demographic characteristics and stock structure of <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> (Microstomus kitt) on the South-west European continental shelf, and they are not considered to be of sufficient economic value Europe-wide to wan-ant annual assessment. This study investigates whether populations of <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> in ICES. (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea) Divisions Vlla;e;f;g & h should be viewed as discrete stocks for assessment and management purposes by examining various life history parameters and population characteristics from samples collected during research surveys from 1992 to 2001. Clear differences were found in the recruitment process (length and age based) and length frequency distributions in catches from north (Vlla;f;g) and south (Vlle;h) of the Cornish Peninsula. Temporal changes in L 1 and a crude maturity analysis support this north/south divide. Sex ratios are similar in Vlla and f, but markedly different to the ratio's observed in Vllg and e. Mean length at age analysis was inconclusive, probably as a result of limited data. It is proposed that, in the absence of further research, <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> populations in Vlle&h and Vllf&g exhibit sufficient similarities to be considered as two gross management and assessment units. From a practical perspective, however, current data availability will preclude useful stock assessments and reduce the potential for management options for all areas except Vlle. Traditional and separable VPA models are used to carry out an assessment of stock status for <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> in ICES Division Vile.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest in the protection of sea bed habitats that are important for commercially exploited fish species ('Essential Fish Habitats', EFH) and may be vulnerable to anthropogenic activities such as bottom fishing or aggregate extraction. Locating such habitats in the vast space of the sea, however, is difficult. The concept of habitat selection based on 'Ideal free distribution' theory suggests that areas of high suitability may attract larger quantities of fish than less suitable or unsuitable areas. Here, we used catch data from groundfish surveys to identify areas of consistently high densities of whiting (Merlangius merlangus), cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), in the Irish Sea and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), <b>sole</b> (Solea solea), <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> (Microstomus kitt) in the English Channel over a period of 9 and 10 years respectively. A method was developed to identify areas of the seabed that may constitute EFHs and may therefore merit further investigations. In addition, the number of potential EFHs identified and the number of stations where no fish were caught gave an indication of the site specificity of the fish species analysed. For the gadoids, whiting was found to be less site specific than cod and haddock, while for the flatfish plaice and sole were less site specific then <b>lemon</b> <b>sole.</b> Our findings are discussed in the context of previously published studies on dietary specialism. The site specificity of demersal fish has implications for the siting process for marine protected areas as fish species with a strong habitat affinity can be expected to benefit more from such management schemes...|$|R
40|$|During {{the fishing}} process, fish {{react to a}} trawl {{with a series of}} {{behaviours}} that often are species and size specific. Thus, a thorough understanding of fish behaviour in relation to fishing gear and a scientific understanding of the ability of different gear designs to utilize or stimulate various behavioural patterns during the catching process are essential for developing more efficient, selective, and environmentally friendly trawls. Although many behavioural studies using optical and acoustic observation systems have been conducted, harsh observation conditions on the fishing grounds often hamper the ability to directly observe fish behaviour in relation to fishing gear. As an alternative to optical and acoustic methods, we developed and applied a new mathematical model to catch data to extract detailed and quantitative information about species- and size-dependent escape behaviour in towed fishing gear such as trawls. We used catch comparison data collected with a twin trawl setup; the only difference between the two trawls was that a 12 m long upper section was replaced with 800 mm diamond meshes in one of them. We investigated the length-based escape behaviour of cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), saithe (Pollachius virens), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus), and <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> (Microstomus kitt) and quantified the extent to which behavioural responses set limits for the large mesh panel's selective efficiency. Around 85 % of saithe, 80 % of haddock, 44 % of witch flounder, 55 % of <b>lemon</b> <b>sole,</b> and 55 % of cod (below 68 cm) contacted the large mesh panel and escaped. We also demonstrated the need to account for potential selectivity in the trawl body, as it can bias the assessment of length-based escape behaviour. Our indirect assessment of fish behaviour was in agreement with the direct observations made for the same species in a similar section of the trawl body reported in the literature...|$|R

These fishes are {{primarily}} in a South Pacific group, occurring mostly around Australia and New Zealand. Up to now, there has been controversy over the taxonomic status of the rhombosoleids. Regan ([1910]) separated Pleuronectidae into three subfamilies: Pleuronectinae, Samarinae, and Rhombosoleinae, and Hubbs ([1945]) also admitted this opinion. Then, Chabanaud ([1946]) recommended a familial ranking for Rhombosoleinae based on their three ‘highly important’ morphological characteristics. However, this recommendation was not widely accepted. Only some researchers agreed with the classification (Chapleau and Keast [1988]; Cooper and Chapleau [1998]; Guibord [2003]; Nelson [2006]), while the others kept using a subfamilial ranking (Sakamoto [1984]; Li and Wang [1995]; Schwarzhans [1999]; Evseenko [2004]).|$|R
