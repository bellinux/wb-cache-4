5|$|On 22 May 2013, Valor por Tamaulipas {{released}} a video {{sent to the}} page by an alleged organized crime group. In the video, {{a man and a}} woman are interrogated by alleged drug traffickers and ask the administrator to close the page and reveal his true identity. The couple was presented as supposed family members of the administrator; however, he later indicated that they were not his family, and that the criminal organization had either confused them or simply targeted a random family to pressure to administrator to close the page. Valor por Tamaulipas responded by <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> to the authorities in Tamaulipas and blamed them for the death of a person who died of a cardiac arrest after the couple was kidnapped; the administrator also accused the Tamaulipas authorities of protecting Los Zetas drug cartel.|$|E
5|$|To attract {{support from}} Kenya's Indian community, he {{made contact with}} Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of the newly {{independent}} Indian republic. Nehru's response was supportive, <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> to Kenya's Indian minority reminding {{them that they were}} the guests of the indigenous African population. Relations with the white minority nevertheless remained strained; for most white Kenyans, Kenyatta was their principal enemy, an agitator with links to the Soviet Union and who had the impertinence to marry a white woman. They too increasingly called for further Kenyan autonomy from the British government, but wanted continued white-minority rule and closer links to the white-minority governments of South Africa, Northern Rhodesia, and Southern Rhodesia; they viewed the newly elected Labour Party government of Britain with great suspicion. The white Electors' Union had put forward a 'Kenya Plan' which proposed greater white settlement in Kenya, bringing Tanganyika into the British Empire, and incorporating it within their new British East African Dominion. In April 1950, Kenyatta was present at a joint meeting of KAU and the East African Indian National Congress in which they both expressed opposition to the Kenya Plan.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the length}} of the voyage to Australia, and the fact that Andersen {{routinely}} went long periods without <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> <b>message,</b> the Danish were not initially worried. However, concern mounted as months passed without word. In April 1929 the Danish East Asiatic Company dispatched a motor vessel, the Mexico, to Tristan da Cunha. Residents reported having seen a large five-masted ship with its foremast broken on January 21, 1929; however it had not attempted to land on the island. The Mexico, joined by the British Royal Navy, searched for the København for several months, but found no sign of it. The Danish government officially declared the ship and its crew were lost at sea.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the nature}} of the first detection, policy- or {{decision-makers}} might have the opportunity to make a conscious decision about composing and <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> <b>message.</b> The ambiguity and content of signals sent both to and from Earth would have profound implications for what actions needed to be taken. A PDP that did not take signal comprehensibility into account would not be flexible enough to inform appropriate action. The area of SETI research known as CETI (Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence), is concerned with how humankind should carry out this communication and, to some extent, representation problems such as whether a response should be with one collective voice or if anyone with access to a transmitter should have the right to communicate.|$|E

25|$|Adémar de Chabannes {{wrote about}} the events, drawing {{associations}} between Al-Hakim (who founded the Druze faith and self-proclaimed himself to be the Mahdi) and the Antichrist, blaming the Jews for inspiring his desecration of the Holy Sepulchre. Rudolfus Glaber also wrote {{a history of the}} events blaming French Jews from Orléans for <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> to the Caliph via a pilgrim disguised as a Jew. The message was said to have been hidden inside a hollow staff and urged the Caliph to destroy the sepulchre on threat Christians would take over his empire otherwise. Rudolfus portrays Al-Hakim as gullible and firmly cast blame on the Jews. This led to outbreaks of antisemitism and violence against Jews across Europe with King Robert II of France ordering forced conversions and Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor to expel Jews from Mainz, condemning Judaism as heresy.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant Job Rosenthal, {{commanding}} Kingani, {{made several}} passes and observed work underway {{on a new}} harbour at Kalemie, south of Lukuga, where Spicer-Simson intended to make his base. Still lacking detailed information on the enemy's movements, Kingani returned early {{on the morning of}} 1 December and attempted to approach the harbour. Rosenthal's vessel was spotted by the shore batteries and driven away, but returned the following night and Rosenthal himself swam to Lukuga to examine the slipways under construction. He also discovered the camps, where the British flag revealed the presence of Spicer-Simson and his expedition. Rosenthal travelled down the railway line and discovered both Mimi and Toutou, and the disassembled parts of Baron Dhanis. Realising that the threat actually lay in the British vessels, he attempted to return to Kingani, but was unable to locate her in the dark. He attempted to conceal himself and hoped that Kingani would return at nightfall, but was discovered by a Belgian patrol and taken prisoner. While a captive he succeeded in <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> <b>message,</b> with a secret addendum written in urine to Zimmer warning him of what he had seen, but the message did not reach Kigoma for several months.|$|E
