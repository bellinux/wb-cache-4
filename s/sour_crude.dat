40|$|The {{world market}} {{of crude oil}} has three well {{established}} benchmarks used for pricing of other crudes: West Texas Intermediate, Europe Brent and Dubai Fateh. The relevance of these are however declining, as {{the output of the}} benchmarks is decreasing, and as an increasing share of world crude produced is of worse quality than the benchmarks (pointed out by e. g. Montepeque, 2005). Particularly the segment of medium density, <b>sour</b> <b>crudes</b> is lacking a reliable benchmark. We apply Granger causality tests to study the price dependencies of 32 crude oils empirically. The aim is to establish what crudes are setting the prices and what crudes are just follow the general market trend. The investigation is performed globally as well as for different quality segments, geographical segments and the segments of OPEC and non-OPEC crudes. The results indicate that crude oil price analysts should follow at least four different crudes that are if not benchmarks, at least good price indicators. While the well-established benchmarks WTI and Brent still lead the market, they are not the only crude prices worth paying attention to. In particular, Russian Urals drives global prices in a significant way, and Iran Seri Kerir is a significant price setter within OPEC. Dubai Fateh does not display any significant influence as a price setter. The lack of a reliable benchmark for medium density, <b>sour</b> <b>crudes</b> is thereby confirmed. ...|$|R

To achieve this, a four stage optimization strategy is developed. In the screening and scoping stage, the energy integration opportunities are explored. In site level optimization, the overall integration among refinery and gasification is considered to maximize the margin. In process level optimization, appropriate integration among gasification, hydrogen, and utility systems is derived to minimize the investment. Finally, the simultaneous optimization of site and process levels is carried out to trade off between benefits and investment. By applying this methodology to a refinery case study, signific marginal improvement is achieved with minimal investment...|$|R

40|$|Upon {{request of}} the VPR and the thesis advisor this item has been made {{administrative}} access only until further notice. Biodegradation of petroleum has been observed {{to be one of}} the most important factors that can alter reservoir chemistry. Biodegradation of petroleum has been connected to the generation of heavy oil at the expense of light hydrocarbon components. Generally, heavy oil is associated with the increasing in metal and sulfur content as well as viscosity. In addition, petroleum biodegradation will result in the production of certain metabolites that are implicated in forming emulsions and corrosion problems in the producing and refining facilities. However, identifying the microrganisms that catalyse this biodegradation is crucial to understanding their role in the hydrocarbons alteration. In this thesis, I addressed the connection between the petroleum biodegradation and the formation of light hydrocarbon components at the expense of heavy hydrocarbon components, and the increase in gas/oil ratio. A comparison between light, extra light, and medium <b>sour</b> <b>crudes</b> lends support to the hypothesis of light hydrocarbons formation through biodegradation of long chain oil components. The results suggested that there was no direct relationship between the relative density of oil and the level of biodegradation, but, there was a positive correlation between the level of biodegradation, the formation of light hydrocarbons, and an increase in the gas/oil ratio. As a first step in investigating this correlation, a metagenomics approach was used to identify and characterize the biodiversity in a European oil field. Extrapolation of the oilfield microbiome data based on an analysis of 200 species generated a hypothetical metabolic map that suggests a new model for petroleum formation and degradation that challenges the accepted dogma in which aerobic and anaerobic petroleum degradation is taking place in the hydrocarbons reservoir, as it is a matter of rate; where the aerobic petroleum degradation targets the short-chain hydrocarbons specifically methane and result in heavy oil generation; whereas the anaerobic petroleum degradation leads to form the gaseous components such as methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. Hence, the gaseous components have a direct impact on the oil density when they represent the majority of the oil field composition by making it more gaseous than liquid...|$|R

In addition, the research paper will examine the Nigerian Oil Industry and the World Oil Industry, in order to demonstrate the importance of such industry and the necessity of marketing one’s product. My objective was to demonstrate that the new trend “global structural transforming trend” in the oil refining market had no significant impact on the Marketing of Nigerian light and sweet crude oils. On the other hand, the real significant impact on the Marketing of Nigerian light and sweet crude oils, is the Management style of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the lack of information that is provided from the latter, the lack of infrastructure in Niger Delta area, the disruption in their crude oil supply and the decrease in Nigeria’s Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) have dramatically caused distress in the Nigerian Oil Market. Concerning external challenges, the American Shale Boom has impacted the crude exportation to the USA and this Revolution has caused not only distress in the Nigeria Market but globally, with fallen crude oil prices and the conquer for market share among producers. In conclusion, reasonable evidence has proven that the market is not indeed at this instance geared towards “heavier and more sour crudes”. On the contrary, the findings had illustrated that the Oil Market Industry is quite oversupplied with “light and sweet crudes”, thus beneficial for refiners, but not for the Nigerian Oil Industry...|$|R

In this methodology two stochastic models are applied; Poisson process is used to model pit initiation and Gamma process to model the pit depth-growth. Such methods are validated using data produced by computer modeling procedures. On the other hand, in the oil industry it is common not to inspect the entire vessels surface; instead of this only a small part of the surface is under inspection. According to this, the use of Block Maxima (BM) and Peak-Over-Threshold (POT) models “EXTREME VALUE STATISTICS ” to characterize the probability distribution of maximum pit depths is also approached...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates {{quantitative}} techniques for trading strategies on two commodities, {{the difference of}} whose prices exhibits a long-term historical relationship known as mean-reversion. A portfolio of two commodity prices with very similar characteristics, the spread may {{be regarded as a}} distinct process from the underlying price processes so deserves to be modeled directly. To pave the way for modeling the spread processes, the fundamental concepts, notions, properties of commodity markets such as the forward prices, the futures prices, and convenience yields are described. Some popular commodity pricing models including both one and two factor models are reviewed. A new mean-reverting process to model the commodity spot prices is introduced. Some analytical results for this process are derived and its properties are analyzed. We compare the new one-factor model with a common existing one-factor model by applying these two models to price West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, and discuss its advantages and disadvantages. We investigate the recent behavioral change in the location spread process between WTI crude oil and Brent oil. The existing three major approaches to price a spread process namely cointegration, one-factor and two-factor models fail to fully capture these behavioral changes. We, therefore, extend the one-factor and two-factor spread models by including a compound Poisson process where jump sizes follow a double exponential distribution. We generalize the existing one-factor mean-reverting dynamics (Vasicek process) by replacing the constant diffusion term with a nonlinear term to price the spread process. Applying the new process to the empirical location spread between WTI and Brent crude oils dataset, it is shown how the generalized dynamics can rigorously capture the most important characteristics of the spread process namely high volatility, skewness and kurtosis. To consider the recent structural breaks in the location spread between WTI and Brent, we incorporate regime switching dynamics in the generalized model and Vasicek process by including two regimes. We also introduce a new mean-reverting random walk, derive its continuous time stochastic differential equation and obtain some analytical results about its solution. This new mean-reverting process is compared with the Vasicek process and its advantages discussed. We showed that this new model for spread dynamics is capable of capturing the possible skewness, kurtosis, and heavy tails in the transition density of the price spread process. Since the analytical transition density is unknown for this nonlinear stochastic process, the local linearization method is deployed to estimate the model parameters. We apply this method to empirical data for modeling the spread between WTI crude oil and West Texas <b>Sour</b> (WTS) <b>crude</b> oil. Finally, we apply the introduced trading strategies to empirical data for the location spread between WTI and Brent crude oils, analyze, and compare the profitability of the strategies. The optimal trading strategies for the spread dynamics in the cointegration approach and the one-factor mean-reverting process are discussed and applied to our considered empirical dataset. We suggest to use the stationary distribution to find optimal thresholds for log-term investment strategies when the spread dynamics is assumed to follow a Vasicek process. To incorporate essential features of a spread process such as skewness and kurtosis into the spread trading strategies, we extend the optimal trading strategies by considering optimal asymmetric thresholds...|$|R
