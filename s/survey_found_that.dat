5|$|Acute {{beryllium}} {{disease in the}} form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases. Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the differential diagnosis is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.|$|E
50|$|A {{study of}} two large {{population-based}} U.S. <b>surveys</b> <b>found</b> <b>that,</b> on average, women expect fewer years of sexual activity, mainly due to prevalent widowhood among older women. This gender disparity is attenuated {{for people with}} a spouse or other intimate partner. The study also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> men tend to lose more years of sexually active life due to poor health.|$|R

5|$|Sri Lankan Tamils {{continue}} to seek refuge in countries like Canada and Australia. The International Organization for Migration and the Australian government have declared Tamil refugees as economic migrants. Canada has tightened controls on their refugee program due to various abuses within the Canadian refugee system.

5|$|The Saudi Arabian {{government}} and other Gulf region governments strongly support the King of Bahrain. Although {{government officials and}} media often accuse the opposition of being influenced by Iran, a government-appointed commission found no evidence supporting the claim. Iran has historically claimed Bahrain as a province, but the claim was dropped after a UN 1970 <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> most Bahraini people preferred independence over Iranian control.|$|E
5|$|VHEMT {{promotes}} a more extreme ideology than Population Action International, {{a group that}} argues humanity should reduce—but not eliminate—its population {{to care for the}} Earth. However, the VHEMT platform is more moderate and serious than the Church of Euthanasia, which advocates population reduction by suicide and cannibalism. The 1995 <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 36% considered themselves members of Earth First! or had donated to the group in the previous five years.|$|E

5|$|A 2005 <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 68% of American flex-fuel car {{owners were}} not aware they owned an E85 flex. This was because the exteriors of flex and non-flex {{vehicles}} look exactly the same; there is no sale price difference between them; the lack of consumers' awareness about E85s; and also the initial decision of American automakers of not putting any kind of exterior labeling, so buyers could be unaware they are purchasing an E85 vehicle. Since 2008, all new FFV models in the US feature a bright yellow gas cap to remind drivers of the E85 capabilities and proper flex-fuel badging.|$|E

The scheme includes a hotel, offices, shops and eating places, and is expected to create 2,000permanent jobs. A further £20million is earmarked for a refurbishment of the nearby Altrincham Interchange. A 2010 <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> despite being in one of the country's most affluent areas, {{nearly a third of the}} shops in Altrincham were vacant; Trafford council attributed the high number (78) to the effects of the recession and plans to refurbish Stamford House, which left most of its shops unused.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 Consumer Reports {{published}} {{results from}} a survey conducted with 19 secret shoppers that went to 85 dealerships in four states, making anonymous visits between December 2013 and March 2014. The secret shoppers asked a number of specific questions about cars to test the salespeople’s knowledge about electric cars. The consumer magazine decided to conduct the survey after several consumers who {{wanted to buy a}} plug-in car reported to the organization that some dealerships were steering them toward gasoline-powered models. The <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> not all sales people seemed enthusiastic about making PEV sales; a few outright discouraged it, and even one dealer was reluctant to even show a plug-in model despite having one in stock. And many sales people seemed not to have a good understanding of electric-car tax breaks and other incentives or of charging needs and costs. Consumer Reports also found that when it came to answering basic questions, sales people at Chevrolet, Ford, and Nissan dealerships tended to be better informed than those at Honda and Toyota. The <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> most of the Toyota dealerships visited recommended against buying a Prius Plug-in and suggested buying a standard Prius hybrid instead. Overall, the secret shoppers reported that only 13 dealers “discouraged sale of EV,” with seven of them being in New York. However, at 35 of the 85 dealerships visited, the secret shoppers said sales people recommended buying a gasoline-powered car instead.|$|E

The tanks which cost $2.5 million each were used to slaughter Albanian children... I am ashamed.|$|R
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, {{agriculture}} {{was the biggest}} industry in Ireland. In 1876, {{the government of the}} United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland commissioned a survey to find who owned the land in Ireland. The <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> almost all land was the property of just 10,000 people, or 0.2% of the population. The majority were small landlords, but the 750 richest landlords owned half of the country between them. Many of the richest were absentee landlords who lived in Britain or elsewhere in Ireland, and paid agents like Charles Boycott to manage their estates.|$|E
5|$|Ireland once {{dominated}} the world's market for whiskey, producing 90% of the world's whiskey {{at the start}} of the 20th century. However, as a consequence of bootleggers during the prohibition in the United States (who sold poor-quality whiskey bearing Irish-sounding names thus eroding the pre-prohibition popularity for Irish brands) and tariffs on Irish whiskey across the British Empire during the Anglo-Irish Trade War of the 1930s, sales of Irish whiskey worldwide fell to a mere 2% by the mid-20th century. In 1953, an Irish government <b>survey,</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 50 per cent of whiskey drinkers in the United States had never heard of Irish whiskey.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} the 20th century, {{the year}} 2000 problem (Y2K) was the focus of {{significant}} COBOL programming effort, sometimes by the same programmers who had designed the systems decades before. The particular level of effort required to correct COBOL code has been attributed to the large amount of business-oriented COBOL, as business applications use dates heavily, and to fixed-length data fields. After the clean-up effort put into these programs for Y2K, a 2003 <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> many remained in use.|$|E

In March 2013, Tostitos, a U.S. brand of tortilla chips and dips, hired the Ketchum communications agency to perform a survey concerning double dipping that polled over 1,000 Americans. The <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 46% of male participants double-dip at a party, compared to 32% of females. 54% stated {{that they would not}} consume dip after seeing another person double-dip, and 22% stated that they did not care. 25% stated that they would verbally object to a person caught double-dipping.|$|E

A survey by the same organisation in June 2012 showed an improvement for Labour, with 32% against the Nationalists' 45%. The same poll indicated a personal approval rating for Lamont of 9%, compared to 13% for Salmond. A {{poll conducted}} by Ipsos MORI on behalf of STV in September 2013 indicated that 37% of respondents were satisfied with Labour's performance compared to 41% for the SNP. That <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Lamont had a personal approval rating of +6%, against +8% for Salmond.

However, during January 31, the system started to re-curve towards the southeast {{and as a result}} did not make landfall on the island, but Gene's outerbands produced gale force winds and heavy rain on various southern Vanuatuan islands for about 12 hours. However the system only caused no deaths and severe damage to Futuna island, while sparing other nearby islands. On Futuna Island, Gene caused damages to buildings, Plants used for weaving and generating income, trails, native and non native homes, waterlines, food gardens, food producing plants, crops, and other critical structures and littered footpaths with fallen trees and debris. As a result of damages to waterlines from falling debris, flooding and contaminated drinking water were reported in some villages with pipes openly leaking. After an aerial <b>survey</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> more than 70% of garden crops had been damaged by Gene, the Vanuatu Government declared Futuna island a disaster zone.|$|E
