5|$|Having survived {{until the}} end of the time stop, the LEP is bound by law and leaves the {{remaining}} gold and departs. At the end, Butler demands an explanation as to how Artemis came up with the idea of using <b>sleeping</b> <b>pills.</b> Artemis explains that he had gotten the idea from old fairy tales, in which human characters never wake up at an inopportune moment for the fairies, and had guessed that time-stops were the reason. Concluding that the time-stop forces a being to stay in whichever state of consciousness they were in when the time-stop is started, Artemis uses <b>sleeping</b> <b>pills</b> to break out of the time-stop. Artemis finds his mother has fully recovered from her insanity thanks to Holly's magic.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, {{at the age}} of 26, O'Brien {{collapsed}} on stage during a performance, and later died due to complications after an appendicitis operation. Storm disbanded the Hurricanes and became a disc jockey, working at the Silver Blades Ice Rink in Liverpool, in Benidorm (he was also a water-skiing instructor there) in Jersey and Amsterdam. When Storm's father died, he returned from Amsterdam to Liverpool to be with his mother. He developed a chest infection and could not sleep properly, so he took <b>sleeping</b> <b>pills.</b> On 28 September 1972, Storm and his mother were both found dead, at Stormsville. The post mortem revealed that Storm had alcohol and <b>sleeping</b> <b>pills</b> in his blood (as had his mother) but not enough to cause his death, which was ruled accidental. Although it could not be proven, it is thought that his mother had committed suicide after finding Storm's body.|$|E

Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) drives Chris to the prison, so he can see Hudson and sort things out. Hudson tells Chris that he cut off contact as he needed time to prepare himself for prison. Chris asks Hudson to give their relationship another go and he agrees. Chris keeps Hudson's incarceration a secret from his parents, so he is angered when Sonya Rebecchi (Eve Morey) inadvertently reveals his secret to his mother, Patricia (Katerina Kotsonis). When Patricia is later arrested for theft, Chris learns that she is a gambling addict and Sonya knew.|$|E

Holly grants the wish at the cost of half the gold. The LEP decides to send in a 'blue rinse' – a {{biological}} bomb that kills all organic life— to eliminate Artemis and allow for the retrieval of the gold, but this fails when Artemis escapes the time-stop by drugging himself and his comrades with <b>sleeping</b> <b>pills.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the fight, the Fitzgeralds kept up {{appearances}} {{with their}} friends, seeming happy. In September, Zelda overdosed on <b>sleeping</b> <b>pills.</b> The couple never {{spoke of the}} incident, and refused to discuss {{whether or not it}} was a suicide attempt. Scott returned to writing, finishing The Great Gatsby in October. They attempted to celebrate with travel to Rome and Capri, but both were unhappy and unhealthy. When he received the proofs from his novel he fretted over the title: Trimalchio in West Egg, just Trimalchio or Gatsby, Gold-hatted Gatsby, or The High-bouncing Lover. It was Zelda who preferred The Great Gatsby. It was also on this trip, while ill with colitis, that Zelda began painting.|$|E

5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of the Netherlands, one of van Meegeren’s agents sold the Vermeer forgery Christ with the Adulteress to Nazi banker and art dealer Alois Miedl in 1942. Experts could probably have identified it as a forgery; as van Meegeren's health declined, so did {{the quality of his}} work. He chain-smoked, drank heavily, and became addicted to morphine-laced <b>sleeping</b> <b>pills.</b> Fortunately for van Meegeren, there were no genuine Vermeers available for comparison, since most museum collections were in protective storage as a prevention against war damage. Miedl then sold it to Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring for 1.65million guilders ($625,000 or $7million today).|$|E
5|$|Suffering {{from what}} would today be {{described}} as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Murphy slept with a loaded handgun under his pillow.

Murphy died in a plane crash in Virginia in 1971, which was shortly before his 46th birthday. He was interred with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. His grave is one of the most visited sites in the cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Carey has {{routinely}} written {{throughout his}} career, including developing his stand-up comedy routines {{in his early}} stand-up career, and then moving on to assist in writing sitcoms.

He also revealed that he was once molested, had suffered bouts of depression, and had made two suicide attempts by swallowing {{a large amount of}} <b>sleeping</b> <b>pills.</b> The book discusses his college fraternity years while attending Kent State University and his professional career up to that time. The book featured large amounts of profanity and, as the title suggests, includes multiple dirty jokes (there is one at the start of each chapter) and references to beer, which was a departure from his on-screen persona. The book was featured on The New York Times bestseller list for three months.|$|E
5|$|David's {{private life}} was less felicitous. In April 1963 her affair with Higgins {{came to an}} end when he remarried. For a period she drank too much brandy and resorted too often to <b>sleeping</b> <b>pills.</b> Probably {{as a result of these}} factors and overwork, in 1963, when she was 49, David {{suffered}} a cerebral haemorrhage. She kept the news of the event within her close circle of friends—none of the editors of the publications she worked for were aware of the collapse—as she did not want her reputation as a hard worker to be damaged. She recovered, but her confidence was badly shaken and her sense of taste was temporarily affected; for a period she could not taste salt, or the effect salt had on what she was cooking, but her sense of smell of frying onions was so enhanced as to be unpleasant for her.|$|E
5|$|During the trip, Homer {{falls asleep}} and wakes up {{abruptly}} {{at the wheel}} of the truck due to taking a combination of pep pills and <b>sleeping</b> <b>pills</b> that he bought at a general store.

50|$|Pheniramine (INN, {{trade name}} Avil, among others) is an {{antihistamine}} with anticholinergic properties {{used to treat}} allergic conditions such as hay fever or urticaria. It has relatively strong sedative effects, and may sometimes be used off-label as an over-the-counter <b>sleeping</b> <b>pill</b> {{in a similar manner}} to other sedating antihistamines such as diphenhydramine. Pheniramine is also commonly found in eyedrops used for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Mulder's mother Teena {{is found}} dead in her home. It is found she overdosed on <b>sleeping</b> <b>pills</b> after she burned all her {{pictures}} of Samantha and placed tape around her baseboards and turned the gas in the oven on. Mulder believes she was murdered and has Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) do an autopsy. Later, Mulder visits the mother who was convicted twelve years prior. She tells him that Samantha is a walk-in, a kind spirit who takes children {{so that they may}} be shielded from potential harm in their life. The mother tells Mulder that the children are safe, but she has no idea where they are. After hearing this, Mulder believes his mother probably also wrote a note after his sister's disappearance. He begins to think that the alien abduction never happened, and that his mother figured this out, which is why she was murdered. However, after performing the autopsy, Scully tells Mulder that it was definitely suicide, because she was ill with Paget's carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{personality}} cult {{was growing}} outrageously {{at a time}} when his health was in rapid decline. His physical condition was deteriorating; he was a lifelong heavy smoker, he had become addicted to <b>sleeping</b> <b>pills,</b> and had begun drinking to excess. Over the years he had become overweight. From 1973 until his death, Brezhnev's central nervous system underwent chronic deterioration and he had several minor strokes as well as insomnia. In 1975 he suffered his first heart attack. When receiving the Order of Lenin, Brezhnev walked shakily and fumbled his words. According to one American intelligence expert, United States officials knew for several years that Brezhnev had suffered from severe arteriosclerosis and believed he had suffered from other unspecified ailments as well. In 1977 American intelligence officials publicly suggested that Brezhnev had also been suffering from gout, leukemia and emphysema. He was reported to have been fitted with a pacemaker to control his heart rhythm abnormalities. Yevgeniy Chazov, the Chief of the Fourth Directorate of the Ministry of Health, had to keep doctors by Brezhnev's side at all times, and Brezhnev was brought back from near-death on several occasions. At this time, most senior officers of the CPSU wanted to keep Brezhnev alive, even if such men as Mikhail Suslov, Dmitriy Ustinov and Andrei Gromyko, among others, were growing increasingly frustrated with his policies. They did not want to risk a new period of domestic turmoil that might be caused by his death. At about this time First World commentators started guessing Brezhnev's heirs apparent. The most notable candidates were Suslov and Andrei Kirilenko, who were both older than Brezhnev, and Fyodor Kulakov and Konstantin Chernenko, who were younger; Kulakov died of natural causes in 1978.|$|E
