5|$|Following {{the market}} {{turbulence}} of the 1990s financial crises and September 11 {{attacks on the}} U.S. in 2001, financial integration intensified among developed nations and emerging markets, with substantial growth in capital flows among banks and in the trading of financial derivatives and <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> products. Worldwide international capital flows grew from $3 trillion to $11 trillion U.S. dollars from 2002 to 2007, primarily {{in the form of}} short-term money market instruments. The United States experienced growth in the size and complexity of firms engaged in a broad range of financial services across borders {{in the wake of the}} Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999 which repealed the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, ending limitations on commercial banks' investment banking activity. Industrialized nations began relying more on foreign capital to finance domestic investment opportunities, resulting in unprecedented capital flows to advanced economies from developing countries, as reflected by global imbalances which grew to 6% of gross world product in 2007 from 3% in 2001.|$|E

40|$|Infrastructure {{development}} {{represents one}} of the major hindrances to economic growth and social development across all countries worldwide. A one percent increase in GDP is expected in a country with an estimated ten percent increase in infrastructure assets. Private project and <b>structured</b> <b>financing</b> is identified as the most effective tool for the provision of the required infrastructure. The complexity, formidable risks and highly leveraged nature of project and <b>structured</b> <b>financing</b> transactions account for the mismatch between the numbers of infrastructure financing transactions that reach financial close compared to the available pipeline. Increased literature focusing on the public sector procurer and private sector contractor is available in project and <b>structured</b> <b>financing</b> transactions, but scarce research focuses on the risk assessment processes applied by financiers to the due diligence of transactions. In this study, 15 in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with financing experts representing a diverse set of expertise with varying levels of experience in different markets. ATLAS. ti was used to analyse, code and identify themes in the data collected. The findings indicate a wide range of risks and scenarios are considered by financiers with the top risks being political or sovereign risk followed by construction risk.

25|$|Corporate finance is the {{traditional}} aspect of investment banks, which involves helping customers raise funds in capital markets and giving advice on mergers and acquisitions (M); this may involve subscribing investors to a security issuance, coordinating with bidders, or negotiating with a merger target. A pitch book of financial information is generated to market the bank to a potential M client; if the pitch is successful, the bank arranges the deal for the client. The investment banking division (IBD) is generally divided into industry coverage and product coverage groups. Industry coverage groups focus on a specific industry—such as healthcare, public finance (governments), FIG (financial institutions group), industrials, TMT (technology, media, and telecommunications), P (power & energy), consumer/retail, food & beverage, corporate defense and governance—and maintain relationships with corporations within the industry to bring in business for the bank. Product coverage groups focus on financial products—such as mergers and acquisitions, leveraged finance, public finance, asset finance and leasing, <b>structured</b> <b>finance,</b> restructuring, equity, and high-grade debt—and generally work and collaborate with industry groups on the more intricate and specialized needs of a client.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} <b>financing</b> <b>structure</b> and bank liquidity risk.

We adopt four measures to represent financing structure; namely 1) real estate financing, 2) financing concentration, 3) stability of short-term <b>financing</b> <b>structure</b> and 4) stability of medium-term <b>financing</b> <b>structure.</b> Two BASEL III liquidity risk measures are tested; namely, liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) to measure short- and long-term liquidity risk, respectively. Based on panel data regression comprising 27 conventional and 17 Islamic banks from 1994 to 2014, our findings show that real estate financing and stability of short-term <b>financing</b> <b>structure</b> for Islamic banks are positively related to both liquidity risk measures. This implies that {{an increasing number of}} real estate financing and a stable short-term <b>financing</b> <b>structure</b> may increase Islamic banks’ short- and long-term liquidity risks. However, although real estate financing does not affect conventional banks’ liquidity risks, a stable short-term <b>financing</b> <b>structure</b> and increasing <b>financing</b> concentration can positively influence bank long-term liquidity risk. Our findings shed light crucial policy implications for regulatory bodies and market players in the context of liquidity risk management framework as well as the need to develop a separate framework between conventional and Islamic banking institutions...|$|R
