5|$|In most of {{the class}} Enopla ("armed"), the {{proboscis}} exits from a common orifice of the rhynchocoel and mouth. A typical member of this class has a <b>stylet,</b> a calcareous barb, with which the animal stabs the prey many times to inject toxins and digestive secretions. The prey is then swallowed whole or, after partial digestion, its tissues are sucked into the mouth. The <b>stylet</b> is attached about one-third of distance {{from the end of}} the ed proboscis, which extends only enough to expose the <b>stylet.</b> On either side of the active <b>stylet</b> are sacs containing back-up stylets to replace the active one as the animal grows or an active one is lost. Instead of one <b>stylet,</b> the Polystilifera have a pad that bears many tiny stylets, and these animals have separate orifices for the proboscis and mouth, unlike other Enopla. The Enopla can only attack after contacting the prey.|$|E
5|$|Suborder Monostilifera. Includes 500 {{species with}} a single central <b>stylet.</b> Some use the <b>stylet</b> for {{locomotion}} {{as well as for}} capturing prey.|$|E
5|$|Class Anopla ("unarmed"). Includes {{animals with}} {{proboscis}} without <b>stylet,</b> and a mouth underneath {{and behind the}} brain.|$|E
25|$|The tips of {{the right}} and left maxillary <b>stylets</b> are not the same; the right is hook-like and curved, and the left is straight. The right and left mandibular <b>stylets</b> extend along the outer sides of their {{respective}} maxillary <b>stylets</b> and do not reach anywhere near the tip of the fused maxillary <b>stylets.</b> The <b>stylets</b> are retained in a groove in the labium, and during feeding, they are freed from the groove as the jointed labium is bent or folded out of the way; its tip never enters the wound.|$|R
30|$|<b>Stylets</b> are {{the most}} {{frequently}} used devices for tracheal intubation, but can be a source of postoperative pharyngeal pain or hoarseness. In this study, we evaluated extraction forces between polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and stannum (Sn) <b>stylets</b> with various lubricants.|$|R
50|$|The {{mouthparts}} of tardigrades, diptera and aphids {{are also}} called <b>stylets.</b>|$|R
5|$|An intubating <b>stylet</b> is a {{malleable}} metal wire {{designed to be}} inserted into the endotracheal tube to make the tube conform better to the upper airway anatomy of the specific individual. This aid is commonly used with a difficult laryngoscopy. Just as with laryngoscope blades, there are also several types of available stylets, such as the Verathon <b>Stylet,</b> which is specifically designed to follow the 60° blade angle of the GlideScope video laryngoscope.|$|E
5|$|The lighted <b>stylet</b> is {{a device}} that employs the {{principle}} of transillumination to facilitate blind orotracheal intubation (an intubation technique in which the laryngoscopist does not view the glottis).|$|E
5|$|Some nemerteans, such as L. longissimus, absorb {{organic food}} in {{solution}} through their skins, which {{may make the}} long, slim bodies an advantage. Suspension feeding is found only among the specialized symbiotic bdellonemerteans, which have a proboscis but no <b>stylet,</b> and use suckers to attach themselves to bivalves.|$|E
50|$|The mandibles in Phthiraptera (lice) {{are also}} {{modified}} into piercing <b>stylets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|H. suis have {{relatively}} narrow heads with pointed fronts. The mouthparts of H. suis {{are contained in}} the labrum, with teeth at the tip. Within the labrum are four thin, retractable, perforating <b>stylets</b> (the fascicle) used for capillary sucking in the front. Of the <b>stylets</b> that compose the fascicle, two form the food channel, supported by the maxilla. Of the remaining two, one connects the salivary gland to the feeding site, and the other guides the other <b>stylets</b> and is flattened with a serrated tip. The heads have long lateral antennae. A defining feature of H. suis {{is the lack of}} maxillary palps typically found on other lice ...|$|R
25|$|Sponging {{mouthparts}} {{are used}} to sponge and suck liquids, and lack <b>stylets</b> (e.g. most Diptera).|$|R
5|$|Between 1945 and 1952, optical {{engineers}} {{built upon}} the earlier work of Rudolph Schindler (1888–1968), developing the first gastrocamera. In 1964, optical fiber technology {{was applied to}} one of these early gastrocameras to produce the first flexible fiberoptic endoscope. Initially used in upper GI endoscopy, this device was first used for laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation by Peter Murphy, an English anesthetist, in 1967. The concept of using a <b>stylet</b> for replacing or exchanging orotracheal tubes was introduced by Finucane and Kupshik in 1978, using a central venous catheter.|$|E
5|$|Nemerteans {{generally}} move slowly, {{though they}} have occasionally been documented to successfully prey on spiders or insects. Most nemerteans use their external cilia to glide on surfaces on a trail of slime, some of which is produced by glands in the head. Larger species use muscular waves to crawl, and some aquatic species swim by dorso-ventral undulations. Some species burrow by means of muscular peristalsis, and have powerful muscles. Some species of the suborder Monostilifera, whose proboscis have one active <b>stylet,</b> move by extending the proboscis, sticking it to an object and pulling the animal towards the object.|$|E
5|$|The love dart {{is not a}} penial <b>stylet</b> (in {{other words}} {{this is not an}} {{accessory}} organ for sperm transfer). The exchange of sperm between both of the two land snails is a completely separate part of the mating progression. Nevertheless, recent research shows that use of the dart can strongly favor the reproductive outcome for the snail that is able to lodge a dart in its partner. This is because mucus on the dart introduces a hormone-like substance that allows far more of its sperm to survive.|$|E
5|$|Suborder Polystilifera. Includes about 100 pelagic and 50 benthic species. Their pads bear many tiny <b>stylets.</b>|$|R
25|$|Piercing-sucking {{mouthparts}} have <b>stylets,</b> and {{are used}} to penetrate solid tissue and then suck up liquid food.|$|R

25|$|The {{oral cavity}} {{is lined with}} cuticle, which is often {{strengthened}} with ridges or other structures, and, especially in carnivorous species, may bear a number of teeth. The mouth often includes a sharp <b>stylet,</b> which the animal can thrust into its prey. In some species, the <b>stylet</b> is hollow, {{and can be used}} to suck liquids from plants or animals.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive system: The male intromittent organ is {{provided}} with an elongate chitinous <b>stylet.</b> The penis is enclosed in an oval sack. When extracted therefrom it is an almost cylindrical organ with two coils, or constrictions, in its course, bluntly pointed at the apex and much contracted proximally. Its walls are highly muscular, but all the muscles are longitudinal {{and there is no}} circular muscular bulb. Its outstanding feature is the presence of a long, slender, sharply pointed, scimitar-shaped, black, horny <b>stylet</b> with a saddle-shaped base which is sometimes prolonged into a long, sharply pointed spur. In some individuals, however, the spur is completely absent.|$|E
25|$|The mandibular <b>stylet</b> tips {{have small}} teeth, and through {{alternately}} moving these stylets back and forth, the insect cuts {{a path through}} tissue for the maxillary bundle to reach an appropriately sized blood vessel. Pressure from the blood vessel itself fills the insect with blood in three to five minutes. The bug then withdraws the <b>stylet</b> bundle from the feeding position and retracts {{it back into the}} labial groove, folds the entire unit back under the head, and returns to its hiding place. It takes between five and ten minutes for a bed bug to become completely engorged with blood. In all, the insect may spend less than 20 minutes in physical contact with its host, and does not try to feed again until it has either completed a moult or, if an adult, has thoroughly digested the meal.|$|E
30|$|In the future, {{randomized}} {{clinical trials}} comparing the efficacy and complications on Sn and PVC <b>stylets</b> are warranted.|$|R

25|$|The sexes are {{distinct}} (females and males occur). Reproductive system: The penis is broad and blunt, has a weakly marked lateral lobe on its left side near the apex, {{a very small}} <b>stylet,</b> a penial duct running in a zigzag, and no visible trace of an ejaculatory duct. The female reproductive organs are of Hauffenia-type.|$|E
25|$|Herbivores {{may also}} produce salivary enzymes that reduce {{the degree of}} defense {{generated}} by a host plant. The enzyme glucose oxidase, a component of saliva for the caterpillar Helicoverpa zea, counteracts the production of induced defenses in tobacco. Similarly, aphid saliva reduces its host's induced response by forming a barrier between the aphid's <b>stylet</b> and the plant cells.|$|E
25|$|Soil-borne {{nematodes}} {{also have}} been shown to transmit viruses. They acquire and transmit them by feeding on infected roots. Viruses can be transmitted both non-persistently and persistently, but {{there is no evidence of}} viruses being able to replicate in nematodes. The virions attach to the <b>stylet</b> (feeding organ) or to the gut when they feed on an infected plant and can then detach during later feeding to infect other plants. Examples of viruses that can be transmitted by nematodes include tobacco ringspot virus and tobacco rattle virus.|$|E

25|$|Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh (1897–1989) also {{achieved}} significant {{advances in}} techniques for tracheal intubation when he introduced his new curved laryngoscope blade in 1943. The Macintosh blade remains {{to this day}} {{the most widely used}} laryngoscope blade for orotracheal intubation. In 1949, Macintosh published a case report describing the novel use of a gum elastic urinary catheter as an endotracheal tube introducer to facilitate difficult tracheal intubation. Inspired by Macintosh's report, P. Hex Venn (who was at that time the anesthetic advisor to the British firm Eschmann Brothers & Walsh, Ltd.) set about developing an endotracheal tube introducer based on this concept. Venn's design was accepted in March 1973, and {{what became known as the}} Eschmann endotracheal tube introducer went into production later that year. The material of Venn's design was different from that of a gum elastic bougie in that it had two layers: a core of tube woven from polyester threads and an outer resin layer. This provided more stiffness but maintained the flexibility and the slippery surface. Other differences were the length (the new introducer was , which is much longer than the gum elastic bougie) and the presence of a 35° curved tip that let it be steered around obstacles. The concept of using a <b>stylet</b> for replacing or exchanging orotracheal tubes was introduced by Finucane and Kupshik in 1978, using a central venous catheter.|$|E
500|$|The Eschmann {{tracheal}} tube introducer (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a [...] "gum elastic bougie") is specialized type of <b>stylet</b> used to facilitate difficult intubation. This flexible device is [...] in length, 15 French (5mm diameter) with a small [...] "hockey-stick" [...] angle at the far end. Unlike a traditional intubating <b>stylet,</b> the Eschmann {{tracheal tube}} introducer is typically inserted directly into the trachea and then used as a guide over which the endotracheal tube can be passed (in a manner analogous to the Seldinger technique). As the Eschmann tracheal tube introducer is considerably less rigid than a conventional <b>stylet,</b> this technique {{is considered to be a}} relatively atraumatic means of tracheal intubation.|$|E
500|$|Fleas are {{wingless}} insects, 1/16 to 1/8-inch (1.5 to 3.3mm) long, {{that are}} agile, usually dark colored (for example, the reddish-brown {{of the cat}} flea), with a proboscis, or <b>stylet,</b> adapted to feeding by piercing the skin and sucking their host's blood through their epipharynx. [...] Flea legs end in strong claws {{that are designed to}} grasp a host.|$|E

40|$|BGPI : équipe 2 The {{receptor}} of Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) {{has been}} shown previously (Uzest et al., 2009) to be a surface exposed cuticular protein (CuP) occurring {{at the tip of}} maxillary <b>stylets</b> along a discrete organ called the acrostyle. However, while thelocation has been determined, the identity of this receptor has not been identified despite a plethora of attempts. Additionallyit is presumed that the receptors of other non-persistent viruses, including the Potyvirsues and Cucumber mosaic virus arelocated at, or close to, the acrostyle, hence the great interest in this region and its involvement in plant-insect and virusinsectinteractions. Here we identify {{for the first time a}} CuP which is present at the surface of the acrostyle of Acyrthosiphonpisum, making it the first protein specifically identified within the <b>stylets</b> of aphids and for which we propose the name stylin- 1. Additionally we determined that stylin- 1 collocates with the P 2 helper protein of CaMV at the surface of the acrostyle andis conserved within the <b>stylets</b> of several important vectors of non-persistent viruses including Aphis gossypii, Brevycorniaebrassicae and Myzus persicae. Competition/blocking of the acrostyle, by sequentially labelling <b>stylets</b> with the P 2 helperprotein and stylin- 1 antibody, were used to determine the interaction of the two on dissected <b>stylets.</b> In these experimentsP 2 reduced significantly the amount of subsequent labelling of the stylin- 1 antibody indicating competition for the samemolecule. Hence, we propose that stylin- 1 may be the first receptor of a non-persistent virus found...|$|R
