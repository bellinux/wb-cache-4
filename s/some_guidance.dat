25|$|An {{alternative}} to standard IQ tests {{originated in the}} writings of psychologist Lev Vygotsky (1896-1934) from his last two years of work. The notion of the zone of proximal development that he introduced in 1933, roughly a year before his death, served as the banner for his proposal to diagnose development as the level of actual development that can be measured by the child's independent problem solving and, at the same time, the level of proximal, or potential development that is measured in the situation of moderately assisted problem solving by the child. The maximum level of complexity and difficulty of the problem that the child is capable to solve under <b>some</b> <b>guidance</b> indicates the level of potential development. Then, the difference between the higher level of potential and the lower level of actual development indicates the zone of proximal development. Combination of the two indexesthe level of actual and the zone of the proximal developmentaccording to Vygotsky, provides a significantly more informative indicator of psychological development than the assessment of the level of actual development alone.|$|E
25|$|Serious local errors {{can arise}} in {{homology}} models where an insertion or deletion mutation or {{a gap in}} a solved structure result in a region of target sequence {{for which there is}} no corresponding template. This problem can be minimized by the use of multiple templates, but the method is complicated by the templates' differing local structures around the gap and by the likelihood that a missing region in one experimental structure is also missing in other structures of the same protein family. Missing regions are most common in loops where high local flexibility increases the difficulty of resolving the region by structure-determination methods. Although <b>some</b> <b>guidance</b> is provided even with a single template by the positioning of the ends of the missing region, the longer the gap, the more difficult it is to model. Loops of up to about 9 residues can be modeled with moderate accuracy in some cases if the local alignment is correct. Larger regions are often modeled individually using ab initio structure prediction techniques, although this approach has met with only isolated success.|$|E

500|$|In 1988, an 18-year-old Mariah Carey {{moved out}} from her mother's house in Long Island and into an {{apartment}} in Manhattan. She had composed a four-track demo tape with her writing partner Ben Margulies while she was attending high school. As 1988 progressed, Carey struggled to impress record executives with the tape and had failed in securing a record deal. She worked several jobs, including as a waitress and coat-checker, {{in order to pay}} for studio sessions with Margulies to make changes to the demo. After several months, Carey befriended singer Brenda K. Starr, and soon became one of her back-up vocalists. During recording sessions and rehearsals, Starr began to notice [...] "glimpses" [...] of Carey's [...] "gifted" [...] vocals. She thought that Carey was capable of achieving mainstream success and that she needed <b>some</b> <b>guidance</b> to break into the industry.|$|E
500|$|Inchoate {{offences}} in English law are offences in England and Wales {{that cover}} illegal acts which {{have yet to}} be committed, primarily attempts to commit crimes, incitement to commit crimes, and conspiracy to commit crimes. Attempts, governed by the Criminal Attempts Act 1981, are defined as situations where an individual who intends to commit an offence does an act which is [...] "more than merely preparatory" [...] in the offence's commission. Traditionally this definition has caused problems, with no firm rule on what constitutes a [...] "more than merely preparatory" [...] act, but broad judicial statements give <b>some</b> <b>guidance.</b> Incitement, on the other hand, is an offence under the common law, and covers situations where an individual encourages another person to engage in activities which will result in a criminal act taking place, and intends for this act to occur. As a criminal activity, incitement had a particularly broad remit, covering [...] "a suggestion, proposal, request, exhortation, gesture, argument, persuasion, inducement, goading or the arousal of cupidity". It was abolished by the Serious Crime Act 2007, but continues in other offences and as the basis of the new offence of [...] "encouraging or assisting" [...] the commission of a crime.|$|E

2500|$|Dick's wealth {{allowed him}} to provide his own funding, and gave him an {{independence}} the other photographers lacked. [...] Stryker attempted to provide <b>some</b> <b>guidance</b> {{for the kind of}} photographs he was looking for, writing to Dick, [...] "It is terribly important that you in some way try to show the town against this background of waste piles and coal tipples. In other words, it is a coal town and your pictures must tell it." [...] Instead, many of Dick's photographs are interiors, bars, and images of ordinary life. [...] Critic Collen McDannel has pointed out that, particularly in regard to his treatment of religion, Dick's work is different from most of the FSA file. [...] Because of his composition of images of the poor surrounded by religious items and by ordinary household objects (objects not in themselves indicating poverty), Dick's photographs are less politically clear than those of the other FSA photographers. [...] His composition [...] "transgresses common assumptions about men and religion and therefore appears to be less 'documentary.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|One element {{which is}} crucial {{to the success of the}} GRR model is the notion related to 'instructional scaffolding', which is {{grounded}} in Vygotsky's concept of the [...] "zone of proximal development" [...] (ZPD). [...] This is described as the distance between the actual developmental level of a learner as determined by their independent problem solving abilities and the level of potential development through problem-solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers. That is, the distance between what the children can do without assistance and what they can accomplish with the assistance of more capable peers. The zone of proximal development can be applied as an umbrella over the entire GRR model. Students are given support in the form of scaffolding and differentiate instruction throughout all four phases of the process. Teachers may offer more challenging material to high-achieving students, and assist lower-achieving students in needs-based groups. Teachers will support students as needed throughout all four steps finally allowing for the eventual independence of each student. The GRR model [...] "...assumes that [...] will need <b>some</b> <b>guidance</b> in reaching that stage of independence and that it is precisely the teacher's role to provide such guidance".|$|E

2500|$|Skarbek's {{situation}} changed {{greatly in}} 1944, with a {{turn of events}} that led to some of her most famous exploits. Fluent in French, she was offered to SOE's teams in France, under the nom de guerre [...] "Madame Pauline". The offer was timely: SOE was running short of trained operatives to cover the increased demands being placed on it {{in the run-up to the}} invasion of France. New operatives were already in training, but the work took time. If inserted into occupied Europe before they had absorbed the numerous physical and intellectual skills required for survival, the operatives could compromise not only themselves but their SOE colleagues already in place and French Resistance members. Skarbek had a track record of successful courier work in occupied Europe and would need only a little [...] "refresher" [...] work and <b>some</b> <b>guidance</b> about working in France.
