5|$|Cognitive {{abilities}} {{that have been}} investigated include concept formation, sensory skills, and mental representations. Such research has been ongoing since the 1970s. This includes: Acoustic and behavioral mimicry, Comprehension of novel sequences in an artificial language, Memory, Monitoring of self behavior, Discrimination and matching, Comprehension of symbols for various body parts, Comprehension of pointing gestures and gaze (as made by dolphins or humans), Mirror <b>self-recognition,</b> and Numerical values.|$|E
5|$|Self-awareness {{appears to}} be a sign of {{abstract}} thinking. Self-awareness, although not well-defined, is believed to be a precursor to more advanced processes such as metacognitive reasoning. The traditional method for measuring this is the mirror test, which determines if an animal possesses the ability of <b>self-recognition.</b> Mammals that have 'passed' the mirror test include Asian elephants (some pass, some do not); chimpanzees; bonobos; orangutans; humans, from 18 months (mirror stage); bottlenose dolphins killer whales; and false killer whales.|$|E
5|$|Elephants exhibit mirror <b>self-recognition,</b> an {{indication}} of self-awareness and cognition that has also been demonstrated in some apes and dolphins. One study of a captive female Asian elephant suggested the animal was capable of learning and distinguishing between several visual and some acoustic discrimination pairs. This individual was even able to score a high accuracy rating when re-tested with the same visual pairs a year later. Elephants are among the species known to use tools. An Asian elephant has been observed modifying branches and using them as flyswatters. Tool modification by these animals is not as advanced as that of chimpanzees. Elephants are popularly thought of as having an excellent memory. This could have a factual basis; they possibly have cognitive maps {{to allow them to}} remember large-scale spaces over long periods of time. Individuals appear {{to be able to keep}} track of the current location of their family members.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{investigations}} of bottlenose dolphin intelligence have been conducted, examining mimicry, use of artificial language, object categorization, and <b>self-recognition.</b> They can use tools (sponging) and transmit cultural knowledge across generations, and their considerable intelligence has driven interaction with humans. Bottlenose dolphins gained popularity from aquarium shows and television {{programs such as}} Flipper. They have also been trained by militaries to locate sea mines or detect and mark enemy divers. In some areas, they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish into their nets and eating the fish that escape. Some encounters with humans are harmful to the dolphins: people hunt them for food, and dolphins are killed inadvertently as a bycatch of tuna fishing and by getting caught in crab traps.|$|E
5|$|Some psychologists {{believe that}} 'while object {{permanence}} alone may not predict communicative achievement, object permanence {{along with several}} other sensorimotor milestones, plays a critical role in, and interacts with, the communicative development of children with severe disabilities'. This was observed in 2006, in a study recognizing where the full mastery of object permanence {{is one of the}} milestones that ties into a child's ability to engage in mental representation. Along with the relationship with language acquisition, object permanence is also related to the achievement of <b>self-recognition.</b> This same study also focused specifically on the effects that Down syndrome has on object permanence. They found that the reason why the children that participated were so successful in acquiring object permanence, was due to their social strength in imitation. Along with imitation being a potential factor in the success, another factor that could impact children with Down syndrome could also be the willingness of the child to cooperate.|$|E
25|$|It was {{recently}} thought that <b>self-recognition</b> {{was restricted to}} mammals with large brains and highly evolved social cognition, but absent from animals without a neocortex. However, in 2008, an investigation of <b>self-recognition</b> in corvids was conducted revealing the ability of <b>self-recognition</b> in the magpie. Mammals and birds inherited the same brain components from their last common ancestor nearly 300 million years ago, and have since independently evolved and formed significantly different brain types. The results of the mirror test showed that although magpies {{do not have a}} neocortex, they are capable of understanding that a mirror image belongs to their own body. The findings show that magpies respond in the mirror test {{in a manner similar to}} apes, dolphins, killer whales, pigs and elephants. This is a remarkable capability that, although not fully concrete in its determination of <b>self-recognition,</b> is at least a prerequisite of <b>self-recognition.</b> This is not only of interest regarding the convergent evolution of social intelligence, it is also valuable for an understanding of the general principles that govern cognitive evolution and their underlying neural mechanisms. The magpies were chosen to study based on their empathy/ lifestyle, a possible precursor for their ability of self-awareness.|$|E
25|$|Marc Jeannerod {{proposed}} {{that the process of}} <b>self-recognition</b> operates covertly and effortlessly. It depends upon a set of mechanisms involving the processing of specific neural signals, from sensory as well as from central origin. Researchers have used experimental situations, in both healthy participants and schizophrenic patients, where these signals can be dissociated from each other and where <b>self-recognition</b> becomes ambiguous. These situations reveal that there are two levels of <b>self-recognition,</b> an automatic level for action identification, and a conscious level for the sense of agency, which both rely on the same principle of congruence of the action-related signals.|$|E
25|$|For {{the advocates}} {{of the idea of}} a {{secondary}} consciousness, <b>self-recognition</b> serves as a critical component and a key defining measure. What is most interesting then, is the evolutionary appeal that arises with the concept of <b>self-recognition.</b> In non-human species and in children, the mirror test (see above) has been used as an indicator of self-awareness.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the study}} on magpies, <b>self-recognition</b> {{was thought to}} reside in the neocortex area of the brain. However, said brain region is absent in birds. <b>Self-recognition</b> in birds and mammals may be a case of {{convergent}} evolution, where similar evolutionary pressures result in similar behaviours or traits, although they arrive at them via different routes and the underlying mechanism may be different.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{it should}} be noted that there has been {{controversy}} over whether <b>self-recognition</b> implies self-awareness.|$|E
25|$|Rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta): It {{has been}} {{reported}} that rhesus monkeys exhibit other behaviours in response to a mirror which indicate <b>self-recognition.</b>|$|E
25|$|Until {{recently}} {{it was thought}} that <b>self-recognition</b> was absent from animals without a neocortex, and was restricted to mammals with large brains and well developed social cognition. However, in 2008 a study of <b>self-recognition</b> in corvids reported significant results for magpies. Mammals and birds inherited the same brain components from their last common ancestor nearly 300 million years ago, and have since independently evolved and formed significantly different brain types. The results of the mirror and mark tests showed that neocortex-less magpies are capable of understanding that a mirror image belongs to their own body. The findings show that magpies respond in the mirror and mark test {{in a manner similar to}} apes, dolphins and elephants. This is a remarkable capability that, although not fully concrete in its determination of <b>self-recognition,</b> is at least a prerequisite of <b>self-recognition.</b> This is not only of interest regarding the convergent evolution of social intelligence; it is also valuable for an understanding of the general principles that govern cognitive evolution and their underlying neural mechanisms. The magpies were chosen to study based on their empathy/lifestyle, a possible precursor for their ability of self-awareness. However even in the chimpanzee, the species most studied and with the most convincing findings, clear-cut evidence of <b>self-recognition</b> is not obtained in all individuals tested. Occurrence is about 75% in young adults and considerably less in young and old individuals. For monkeys, non-primate mammals, and in a number of bird species, exploration of the mirror and social displays were observed. However, hints at mirror-induced self-directed behavior have been obtained.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} <b>self-recognition</b> in mirrors is {{independent}} of familiarity with reflecting surfaces. In some cases the rouge test {{has been shown to}} have differing results, depending on sociocultural orientation. For example, a Cameroonian Nso sample of infants 18 to 20 months of age had an extremely low amount of <b>self-recognition</b> outcomes at 3.2%. The study also found two strong predictors of self-recognition: object stimulation (maternal effort of attracting the attention of the infant to an object either person touched) and mutual eye contact. A strong correlation between self-concept and object permanence have also been demonstrated using the rouge test.|$|E
25|$|The {{most widely}} used test for {{self-awareness}} in animals is the mirror test in which a temporary dye is placed on an animal's body, and the animal is then presented with a mirror; they then see if the animal shows signs of <b>self-recognition.</b>|$|E
25|$|Primates, {{other than}} the great apes, have so far universally failed the mirror test. However, mirror tests with three species of gibbon (Hylobates syndactylus, H.gabriellae, H. leucogenys) have shown convincing {{evidence}} of <b>self-recognition</b> {{despite the fact that}} the animals failed the standard version of the mirror test.|$|E
25|$|Findings in MSR {{studies are}} not always conclusive. Even in chimpanzees, the species most studied and with the most convincing findings, {{clear-cut}} evidence of <b>self-recognition</b> is not obtained in all individuals tested. Prevalence is about 75% in young adults and considerably less in young and aging individuals.|$|E
25|$|The mirror {{test has}} {{attracted}} controversy among some researchers {{because it is}} entirely focused on vision, the primary sense in humans, while other species rely more heavily on other senses such as the olfactory sense in dogs. A study in 2015 showed that the “sniff test of <b>self-recognition</b> (STSR)” provides evidence of self-awareness in dogs.|$|E
25|$|The rouge test is {{a version}} of the mirror test used with children. Using rouge makeup, an {{experimenter}} surreptitiously places a dot {{on the face of the}} child. The child is then placed in front of a mirror and their reactions are monitored; depending on the child's development, distinct categories of responses are demonstrated. This test is widely cited as the primary measure for mirror <b>self-recognition</b> in human children.|$|E
25|$|Ursula Voss of the Universität Bonn {{believes}} that the theory of protoconsciousness may serve as adequate explanation for <b>self-recognition</b> found in birds, as they would develop secondary consciousness during REM sleep. She added that many types of birds have very sophisticated language systems. Don Kuiken of the University of Alberta finds such research interesting as well as {{if we continue to}} study consciousness with animal models (with differing types of consciousness), {{we would be able to}} separate the different forms of reflectiveness found in today's world.|$|E
25|$|By the Middle Ages {{large parts}} of the {{population}} of the Low Countries lived in urbanized centers. These towns and large villages were the carriers of and the centers for <b>self-recognition</b> of Dutch culture. Art and poetry began to emerge, establishing a distinction between the Dutch and other peoples, in particular the French. These urban centers formed out of a realization that cooperation was necessary for survival. Individuals joined together to form communities, and in so doing gave up personal interests and subjugated themselves to local law.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{experiments}} in normal individuals has been undertaken {{in order to}} determine the functional anatomy of the sense of agency. These experiments have consistently documented the role of the posterior parietal cortex as a critical link within the simulation network for <b>self-recognition.</b> Primary sources have reported that activation of the right inferior parietal lobe/temporoparietal junction correlates with the subjective sense of ownership in action execution,and that posterior parietal lesions, especially on the right side, impair the ability of recognizing one's own body parts and self-attributing one's own movements.|$|E
25|$|The results {{uncovered}} by this study at least suggest some {{issues with the}} classic mirror test; primarily, that it assumes that children will recognise the dot of rouge as abnormal and attempt to examine or remove it. The classic test may have produced false negatives, because the child's recognition of the dot {{did not lead to}} them cleaning it. In their modified test, in which the doll was cleaned first, they found a stronger relationship between cleaning the doll's face and the child cleaning its own face. The demonstration with the doll, postulated to demonstrate to the children what to do, may lead to more reliable confirmation of <b>self-recognition.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{disagree}} with these findings, {{arguing that the}} results of these tests are open to human interpretation and susceptible to the Clever Hans effect. This test is much less definitive than when used for primates, because primates can touch the mark or the mirror, while cetaceans cannot, making their alleged <b>self-recognition</b> behavior less certain. Skeptics argue that behaviors that are said to identify self-awareness resemble existing social behaviors, and so researchers could be misinterpreting self-awareness for social responses to another individual. The researchers counter-argue that the behaviors shown are evidence of self-awareness, as they are very different from normal responses to another individual. Whereas apes can merely touch the mark on themselves with their fingers, cetaceans show less definitive behavior of self-awareness; they can only twist and turn themselves to observe the mark.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scientists}} still {{disagree with}} these findings, {{arguing that the}} results of these tests are open to human interpretation and susceptible to the Clever Hans effect. This test is much less definitive than when used for primates, because primates can touch the mark or the mirror, while dolphins cannot, making their alleged <b>self-recognition</b> behavior less certain. Critics argue that behaviors that are said to identify self-awareness resemble existing social behaviors, and so researchers could be misinterpreting social responses to another dolphin. The researchers counter-argue that the behaviors shown to evidence self-awareness are very different from normal responses to another dolphin, including paying significantly more attention to another dolphin than towards their mirror image. Whereas apes can merely touch the mark on themselves with their fingers, dolphins show less definitive behavior of self-awareness, twisting and turning themselves to observe the mark.|$|E
25|$|Other {{similarities}} {{include the}} immunological {{memory of the}} adaptive immune system in vertebrates and the observation that a similar collective memory (operating with a yet-to-be-explained mechanism) occurs in some insect societies e.g. individual Z. angusticollis survive M. anisopliae infections significantly more when {{they have been in}} contact with a previously infected conspecifc, a 'social transfer of immunity' or 'social vaccination'. Transplant rejection caused by non-self major histocompatibility complexes is frequently thought to be a byproduct with no evolutionary function, however Cremer cites cases (such as the colonial star ascidian (Botryllus schlosseri)) where recognizing foreign cells may have evolved as an adaptation - if so, then this could be analogous to the <b>self-recognition</b> systems in social insects which prevent brood parasitism and the worker policing behaviours which suppress 'social tumours'. Specific immune cells in animals 'patrol' tissues looking for parasites, as do worker-caste individuals in colonies.|$|E
25|$|Magpies {{have been}} {{observed}} engaging in elaborate social rituals, possibly including the expression of grief. Mirror <b>self-recognition</b> has been demonstrated in European magpies, making them one of but a few species and the only non-mammal known to possess this capability. The cognitive abilities of the Eurasian magpie are regarded as evidence that intelligence evolved independently in both corvids and primates. This is indicated by tool use, an ability to hide and store food across seasons, episodic memory, using their own experience to predict the behavior of conspecifics. Another behavior exhibiting intelligence is cutting their food in correctly sized proportions for {{the size of their}} young. In captivity, magpies {{have been observed}} counting up to get food, imitating human voices, and regularly using tools to clean their own cages. In the wild, they organise themselves into gangs and use complex strategies hunting other birds and when confronted by predators.|$|E
500|$|The Dothraki {{scenes that}} culminate with the [...] "crowning" [...] of Viserys Targaryen was {{acclaimed}} by critics.

2500|$|The MSR test may be {{of limited}} value when applied to species that {{primarily}} use senses other than vision. [...] For example, dogs mainly use olfaction and audition; vision is used only third. It is suggested this is why dogs fail the MSR test. With this in mind, the biologist Marc Bekoff developed a scent-based paradigm using dog urine to test <b>self-recognition</b> in canines. He tested his own dog, but his results were inconclusive. [...] A 2016 study suggested a new ethological approach, the [...] "Sniff test of <b>self-recognition</b> (STSR)" [...] which may shed light on different ways of checking for <b>self-recognition.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The mirror test, {{sometimes}} called the mark test or the mirror <b>self-recognition</b> test (MSR), is a behavioural technique developed in 1970 by psychologist Gordon Gallup Jr. {{as an attempt to}} determine whether a non-human animal possesses the ability of visual <b>self-recognition.</b> [...] The MSR test is the traditional method for attempting to measure self-awareness; however, there has been controversy whether the test is a true indicator.|$|E

Finally, at 18 months half of children recognise the {{reflection in the mirror}} as their own and by 20 to 24 months <b>self-recognition</b> climbs to 65%. Children do so by evincing mark-directed behaviour; they touch their own nose or try to wipe the mark off.|$|E
