40|$|Refining is an {{important}} unit operation in the paper production process and consists in the mechanical beating of the pulp fibres in an aqueous medium. The refining conditions affect fibre morphology, pulp suspension characteristics and paper properties. In this study we investigated the effect of refining intensity - given by the <b>specific</b> <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> (SEL) - on the fibre and paper properties. Lower refining intensity led to lower fibre cutting, lower fines generation, and lower ºSR development. Commercial Eucalyptus globulus bleached pulp was refined in a pilot refiner, using different <b>specific</b> <b>edge</b> <b>loads</b> (0. 05; 0. 1 and 0. 2 J/m) and specific energy consumption of 40, 80 and 120 kWh/ton in order to evaluate paper potential. The highest <b>specific</b> <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> tested (0, 2 J/m) resulted in a lower average fibre length, {{as a result of}} a higher fibre cutting. The papers produced presented higher mechanical resistance, but increasing refinement energy from 80 to 120 kWh/ton did not improve paper properties. On the contrary, with a lowest <b>specific</b> <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> (0, 05 J/m), the papers obtained for different specific energy consumption exhibited lower density (i. e., higher open structure, higher air permeability and lower smoothness) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to find new approaches to evaluate the performance of low-consistency refiners. Data from a paper mill producing TMP from Norway spruce was used in order to find a possible way to calculate the power split between the zones in a TwinFlo refiner. An assumption of equal amount of fibres captured between overlapping bars was found successful in order to develop equations for the power split. The equations predicted equal power in both zones at equal disc gaps. The power was found to increase approximately linearly with decreasing disc gap over the range, 0. 1 - 0. 2 mm. The power split was essential to know for calculating refining intensities expressed as <b>specific</b> <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> and forces on fibres in the two zones.

Theresearch included evaluations of energy efficiency, development of pulpproperties, {{the influence of}} fibre concentration on LC refining and effects of rotorposition in a two-zoned LC refiner. Trials were made in mill scale in a modern TMP line equipped with an MSDImpressafiner for chip pre-treatment, double disc (DD) first stage refining and aprototype 72 -inch TwinFlo LC refiner in the second stage. Tensile index increasedby 8 Nm/g and fibre length was reduced by 10 % in LC refining at 140 kWh/adtgross specific refining energy and <b>specific</b> <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> 1. 0 J/m. Specific lightscattering coefficient did not develop significantly over the LC refiner. The above mentioned TMP line was compared with a two stage single disc highconsistency Twin 60 refiner line. The purpose was to evaluate specific energyconsumption and pulp properties. The two different process solutions were testedin mill scale, running similar Norway spruce wood supply. At the same tensileindex and freeness, the specific energy consumption was 400 kWh/adt lower in theDD-LC concept compared with the SD-SD system. Pulp characteristics of the tworefining concepts were compared at tensile index 47 Nm/g. Fibre length was lowerafter DD-LC refining than after SD-SD refining. Specific light scattering coefficientwas higher and shive content much lower for DD-LC pulp. The effects of sulphite chip pre-treatment on second stage LC refining were alsoevaluated. No apparent differences in fibre properties after LC refining werenoticed between treated and untreated pulps. Sulphite chip pre-treatment iniiicombination with LC refining in second stage, yielded a pulp without screeningand reject refining with tensile index and shives content that were similar to nonpre-treated final pulp after screening and reject refining. A pilot scale study was performed to investigate the influence of fibreconcentration on pulp properties in LC refining of mechanical pulps. MarketCTMP was utilised in all trials and fibre concentrations were controlled by meansof adjustments of the pulp consistency and by screen fractionation of the pulp. Inaddition, various refiner parameters were studied, such as no-load, gap and baredge length. Pulp with the highest fibre concentration supported a larger refinergap than pulp with low fibre concentration at a given gross power input. Fibreshortening was lower and tensile index increase was higher for long fibre enrichedpulp. The {{results from this study}} support the interesting concept of combiningmain line LC refining and screening, where screen reject is recycled to the LCrefiner inlet. It has been observed that the rotor in two-zoned refiners is not always centred,even though pulp flow rate is equal in both refining zones. This leads to unequalplate gaps, which renders unevenly refined pulp. Trials were performed in millscale, using the 72 -inch TwinFlo, to investigate differences in pulp properties androtor positions by means of altering the pressure difference between the refiningzones. In order to produce homogenous pulp, it was found that uneven plate gapscan be compensated for in LC refiners with dual refining zones.

The present study aimed to quantify the {{occurrence of}} edge loading/contact at the articulating surface and to evaluate the effect of cup angles and <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> on the contact mechanics of a modular metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) total hip replacement (THR) during different daily activities. A three-dimensional finite element model was developed based on a modular MoP bearing system. Different cup inclination and anteversion angles were modelled and six daily activities were considered.

Hip simulator testing under a wide range of clinically relevant loading conditions is important. <b>Edge</b> <b>loading</b> of hip replacements can occur following impingement under extreme activities and can also occur during normal gait where there is an offset deficiency and/or joint laxity. This study evaluated a hip simulator method that assessed wear and damage in polyethylene acetabular liners that were subjected to <b>edge</b> <b>loading.</b> The liners tested to evaluate the method were a currently manufactured crosslinked polyethylene acetabular liner and an aged conventional polyethylene acetabular liner. The acetabular liners were tested for five million standard walking cycles and following this five million walking cycles with <b>edge</b> <b>loading.</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions represented a separation of the centres of rotation of the femoral head and the acetabular liner during the swing phase, leading to loading of the liner rim on heel strike.

This study supports previous clinical findings that <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> may cause rim cracking in liners where component positioning is sub-optimal or where material degradation is present.

40|$|Wear {{and fatigue}} of {{polyethylene}} acetabular cups {{have been reported}} {{to play a role in}} the failure of total hip replacements. <b>Edge</b> <b>loading</b> of hip replacements can occur where there is sub-optimal component positioning and/or joint laxity. Wear resistance can be improved by crosslinking but the manufacturing process of these materials involves post-irradiation thermal treatments to recombine free radicals and to stabilise the materials. Stabilisation can also be achieved by adding antioxidants. Material degradation due to oxidation and manufacturing process can result in rim cracking and/or fracture due to a reduction in mechanical properties and this has been observed in vivo. A requirement for pre-clinical hip simulator testing under <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions for all of these materials has therefore been identified. This thesis describes the development and evaluation of a hip simulator <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> protocol using accelerated aged conventional UHMWPE acetabular liners as positive controls and commercially available crosslinked UHMWPE acetabular liners as negative controls. The <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> protocol was then used to evaluate antioxidant stabilised liners in hip simulator tests. Explanted UHMWPE acetabular liners were evaluated for wear and damage mechanisms and compared with the damage observed on the hip simulator tested liners and new methodologies were developed to measure and analyse these explanted liners. The <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> protocol produced cracking and subsurface damage in the aged UHMWPE liners but not in the non-aged crosslinked liners. Rim deformation was observed on all liners and the volume change produced was reduced under <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions for both types of UHMWPE liner.

Specifically, this study investigated the effect of both the variations in the medial–lateral translational mismatch between the centres of the femoral head and acetabular cup and the variations in the cup inclination angles on the occurrence and magnitude of the dynamic separation, the severity of <b>edge</b> <b>loading,</b> and the wear rate of ceramic-on-ceramic hip replacement bearings in a multi-station hip joint simulator during a walking gait cycle. An increased mismatch between the centres of rotation of the femoral head and acetabular cup resulted in an increased level of dynamic separation and an increase in the severity of <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> condition which led to increased wear rate in ceramic-on-ceramic bearings.

Results showed that modelling and verifying the contact and stress results under <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions required more careful computational modelling than for normal loading conditions. The high contact pressures observed during simulations of microseparation models were consistent with the high level of wear and surface damage observed in experimental simulator studies and from patient retrievals. These methods can therefore be used as a technique to simulate wear of hip implant devices. Shakedown assessments showed that under normal, as well as <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> and severe loading conditions the hip device remained below the elastic shakedown region of a rolling and sliding shakedown map, which is ideal for minimal surface contact and subsurface damage...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{computation}} of ﬂexural {{motion of}} a ﬂoating elastic plate is often complicated. The linear approximation {{of the motion}} makes the computation tractable for simple harmonic waves in a plate. I will introduce {{a few examples of}} the linear solution methods from various researchers. This talk will show how the Wiener-Hopf technique gives solutions for a semi-inﬁnite plate with a sinusoidal <b>edge</b> <b>loading.</b> The solution is nearly explicit, which lets us analyze the dynamics of the plate for many frequencies in time and space along the edge. Certain distributions of <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> can approximate 7 a localized forcing on the edge. Then, the Wiener-Hopf technique can be used to ﬁnd the response to a localised force {{at the edge of the}} plate. The resulting solutions may be used to ﬁnd the relationship between the deﬂection and velocity near the location of forcing...|$|R
40|$|Ceramic-on-ceramic {{bearings}} {{have become}} {{of great interest}} due to the substantial improvements in the manufacturing techniques and material properties and due to polyethylene wear debris-induced osteolysis and the issues with metal wear debris and ion release by metal-on-metal bearings. <b>Edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions due to translational malpositioning (microseparation conditions) {{have been shown to}} replicate clinically relevant wear mechanisms and increase the wear of ceramic-on-ceramic bearings; thus, it was necessary to test new bearing materials and designs under these adverse conditions. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effect of increasing head size on the wear of BIOLOX(®) delta ceramic-on-ceramic bearings under <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions due to rotational (steep cup inclination angle) and translational (microseparation) malpositioning. In this study, six 36 -mm ceramic-on-ceramic bearings (BIOLOX delta, CeramTec, Germany) were tested under standard and <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions using the Leeds II hip simulator and compared to the 28 -mm bearings tested and published previously under identical conditions. The mean wear rate under standard gait conditions was below 0. 1 [*]mm(3) /million cycles for both the 28 -mm and the 36 -mm ceramic-on-ceramic bearings, and increasing the inclination angle did not affect the wear rates. The introduction of microseparation to the gait cycle increased the wear rate of ceramic-on-ceramic bearing and resulted in stripe wear on the femoral heads. Under microseparation conditions, the wear rate of size 36 -mm bearings (0. 22 [*]mm(3) /million cycles) was significantly higher (p[*]=[*] 0. 004) than that for size 28 -mm bearings (0. 13 [*]mm(3) /million cycles). This was due to the larger contact area for the larger bearings and deprived lubrication under <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions. The wear rate of BIOLOX delta ceramic-on-ceramic bearings under microseparation conditions was still very low (< 0. 25 [*]mm(3) /million cycles) compared to earlier generation ceramic-on-ceramic bearings (BIOLOX forte, 1. 84 [*]mm(3) /million cycles) and other bearing materials such as metal-on-metal bearings (2 - 8 [*]mm(3) /million cycles) ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>loading</b> in hip {{replacement}} bearings may occur due to rotational and translational mal-positioning. Rotational mal-positioning {{is easier to}} detect clinically which include steep inclination angle and excessive version/anteversion angles. Translational mal-positioning encompasses micro-separation of the centres of rotations {{of the head and}} the cup and could occur due to several clinical reasons, such as head offset deficiency, medialised cup, stem subsidence, impingement, subluxation and laxity of the joint/ soft tissue. Microseparation conditions were validated on the Physiological Anatomical Leeds Mark II Hip Joint Simulator against retrievals and shown to replicate stripe wear, and wear debris seen in vivo. The present thesis is focused on understanding the wear mechanisms of different sized ceramicon- ceramic and metal-on-metal bearings under the different <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> conditions and determining the contributions of rotational and translational mal-positioning to the increase in wear. The wear of ceramic-on-ceramic bearings did not increase due to rotational mal-positioning, however stripe wear and increase in wear rates occurred under translational mal-positioning conditions. On the other hand, the wear of metal-on-metal bearings was influenced by both rotational and translational mal-positioning with the latter having the more severe effect. There was clinically no difference in the wear of the 36 mm bearings when compared to the 28 mm bearings under translational mal-positioning conditions. However, with the larger bearings, <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> due to rotational mal-positioning occurred at a steeper cup inclination angle. <b>Edge</b> <b>loading</b> caused severe wear features and roughening of the surface of metal-on-metal bearings with indications of increased corrosion rates. The new validated geometric measurement and analysis technique have helped determine the volumetric wear of ceramic and metal components and show three-dimensional representations of the wear areas, which could be applied for determining wear volumes and understanding wear features on retrieved explants. This thesis has emphasised the need for a more accurate surgical positioning and shown the necessity for testing {{hip replacement}} bearings under a wider range of clinical conditions that go beyond the current ISO standards. This should also include conditions which generate rotational and translational mal-positioning in vivo...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the radially symmetric nonlinear von Kármán plate equations for circular or annular plates in {{the limit of}} small thickness. The loads on the plate consist of a radially symmetric pressure load and a uniform <b>edge</b> <b>load.</b> The dependence of the steady states on the <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> and thickness is studied using asymptotics as well as numerical calculations. The von Kármán plate equations are a singular perturbation of the Fӧppl membrane equation in the asymptotic limit of small thickness. We study the role of compressive membrane solutions in the small thickness asymptotic behavior of the plate solutions. We give evidence for the existence of a singular compressive solution for the circular membrane and show by a singular perturbation expansion that the nonsingular compressive solution approach this singular solution as the radial stress {{at the center of the}} plate vanishes. In this limit, an infinite number of folds occur with respect to the <b>edge</b> <b>load.</b> Similar behavior is observed for the annular membrane with zero <b>edge</b> <b>load</b> at the inner radius in the limit as the circumferential stress vanishes. We develop multiscale expansions, which are asymptotic to members of this family for plates with edges that are elastically supported against rotation. At some thicknesses this approximation breaks down and a boundary layer appears at the center of the plate. In the limit of small normal load, the points of breakdown approach the bifurcation points corresponding to buckling of the nondeflected state. A uniform asymptotic expansion for small thickness combining the boundary layer with a multiscale approximation of the outer solution is developed for this case. These approximations complement the well known boundary layer expansions based on tensile membrane solutions in describing the bending and stretching of thin plates. The approximation becomes inconsistent as the clamped state is approached by increasing the resistance against rotation at the edge. We prove that such an expansion for the clamped circular plate cannot exist unless the pressure load is self-equilibrating. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{boundary}} element method based evaluation of stress intensity factors for mode I and mixed mode problems under remote and/or crack <b>edge</b> <b>loading.</b> The modified crack closure integral technique {{has been used to}} enhance the accuracy of the computed stress intensity factors. Simple, ready to use, relations for the strain energy release rate have been obtained corresponding to linear, quadratic and quarter point elements surrounding the crack tip. The boundary element method is employed by breaking a domain into two subregions for the mixed mode problems. Case studies involving remote or crack <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> for both mode I and mixed mode problems are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the new scheme. The stress intensity factors based on the proposed scheme show better agreement with the standard solutions available in the literature than those obtained directly through the displacement method.

40|$|The {{connection}} between contact geometry and fatigue in {{tapered roller bearings}} utilized in the railroad environment is still of interest. Roller bearings for railroad applications are typically precision ground with crowned contact geometries to prevent <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> of components. This normally results in completely elastic Hertzian contact stresses under standard railcar loads. However, under extreme <b>load</b> conditions, detrimental <b>edge</b> <b>loading</b> {{has been known to}} occur. It is proposed to develop a tool, using finite element analysis, that can be utilized to optimize complex raceway crown geometries for severe applications. A successful implementation of this tool is presented and validated using proven Hertzian contact theory. Correlation within 5 % of the ultimate surface and subsurface stress magnitudes, using finite element modeling, in contrast with proven contact theory is achieved. In addition, analyses of other load conditions and contact geometries in order to illustrate the practical application of the tool are exhibited...|$|R
