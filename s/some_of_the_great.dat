5|$|The {{council was}} a {{virtually}} full-time institution {{by the late}} fifteenth century, and surviving records from the period indicate it was critical in the working of royal justice. Nominally members of the council were <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> magnates of the realm, but they rarely attended meetings. Most of the active members of the council {{for most of the}} late Medieval Period were career administrators and lawyers, almost exclusively university-educated clergy. The most successful of these moved on to occupy the major ecclesiastical positions in the realm as bishops and, {{towards the end of the}} period, archbishops. By the end of the fifteenth century, this group was being joined by increasing numbers of literate laymen, often secular lawyers, of which the most successful gained preferment in the judicial system and grants of lands and lordships. From the reign of James III onwards, the clerically dominated post of Lord Chancellor was increasingly taken by leading laymen.|$|E
5|$|This {{same period}} of {{economic}} and political uncertainty, however, produced an unsurpassed literary flowering in England. The first signs of a new literary movement had appeared {{at the end of the}} second decade of Elizabeth's reign, with John Lyly's Euphues and Edmund Spenser's The Shepheardes Calender in 1578. During the 1590s, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> names of English literature entered their maturity, including William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe. During this period and into the Jacobean era that followed, the English theatre reached its highest peaks. The notion of a great Elizabethan era depends largely on the builders, dramatists, poets, and musicians who were active during Elizabeth's reign. They owed little directly to the queen, who was never a major patron of the arts.|$|E
5|$|After the Crown {{the most}} {{important}} government institution was the Privy Council, composed of the king's closest advisers, but which, unlike in England, retained legislative and judicial powers. It was relatively small, with normally less than 10 members in a meeting, {{some of whom were}} nominated by Parliament, particularly during the many minorities of the era, as a means of limiting the power of a regent. The council was a virtually full-time institution by the late 15th century, and surviving records from the period indicate it was critical in the working of royal justice. Nominally members of the council were <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> magnates of the realm, but they rarely attended meetings.

5|$|On {{his return}} from Rome, Dunstan at once regained his {{position}} as virtual prime minister of the kingdom. By his advice Ælfstan {{was appointed to the}} Bishopric of London, and Oswald to that of Worcester. In 963, Æthelwold, the Abbot of Abingdon, was appointed to the See of Winchester. With their aid and with the ready support of King Edgar, Dunstan pushed forward his reforms in the English Church. The monks in his communities were taught to live in a spirit of self-sacrifice, and Dunstan actively enforced the law of celibacy whenever possible. He forbade the practices of simony (selling ecclesiastical offices for money) and ended the custom of clerics appointing relatives to offices under their jurisdiction. Monasteries were built, and in <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> cathedrals, monks took the place of the secular canons; in the rest the canons were obliged to live according to rule. The parish priests were compelled to be qualified for their office; they were urged to teach parishioners not only the truths of the Christian faith, but also trades to improve their position. The state saw reforms as well. Good order was maintained throughout the realm and there was respect for the law. Trained bands policed the north, and a navy guarded the shores from Viking raids. There was a level of peace in the kingdom unknown in living memory.|$|E
5|$|The 14th {{century in}} England saw the Great Famine and the Black Death, catastrophic events that killed around half of England's population, {{throwing}} the economy into chaos and undermining the old political order. Social unrest followed, {{resulting in the}} Peasants' Revolt of 1381, while {{the changes in the}} economy resulted in {{the emergence of a new}} class of gentry, and the nobility began to exercise power through a system termed bastard feudalism. Nearly 1,500 villages were deserted by their inhabitants and many men and women sought new opportunities in the towns and cities. New technologies were introduced, and England produced <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> medieval philosophers and natural scientists. English kings in the 14th and 15th centuries laid claim to the French throne, resulting in the Hundred Years' War. At times England enjoyed huge military success, with the economy buoyed by profits from the international wool and cloth trade, but by 1450 the country was in crisis, facing military failure in France and an ongoing recession. More social unrest broke out, followed by the Wars of the Roses, fought between rival factions of the English nobility. Henry VII's victory in 1485 conventionally marks the end of the Middle Ages in England and the start of the Early Modern period.|$|E

25|$|The England team, with Brearley's exit in 1980, {{was never}} truly settled {{throughout}} the 1980s, which {{will probably be}} remembered as a low point for the team.

Long's rule ended abruptly when the governor was assassinated in the state capitol in 1935.|$|E
25|$|What makes Tipling's {{photographic}} work distinctive is {{his artistic}} sense of composition. His work {{is influenced by}} the Swedish painter Bruno Liljefors whose often brooding depictions of predator-prey action – the hunts engaged between sea eagle and eider, goshawk and black grouse – help to create their darkly primitive atmosphere. and by Robert Gillmor's strong graphic,. Tipling cites <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> Eastern painters who practised Oriental ink painting which has its roots in calligraphy, as influential. Much of his work resonates with that sense of proportion achieved in the light, striking shapes of Xu Wei's work.|$|E
25|$|While recuperating in England and {{receiving}} treatment from Sir William Gull, Muybridge {{took up the}} new field of professional photography sometime between 1861 and 1866.

He learned the wet-plate collodion process in England, and may have been influenced by <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> English photographers of those years, such as Julia Margaret Cameron. Also during this period, Muybridge secured at least two British patents for his inventions, including the design of a high speed electrical shutter and electro-timer, to be used alongside a battery of up to 24 cameras.|$|E

25|$|Compared {{with many}} of cricket's {{greatest}} players, {{most of whom were}} specialists, Botham's averages seem fairly ordinary but this overlooks {{the fact that he was}} a genuine all-rounder and it is rare for this type of player to achieve world-class status.

The genuine all-rounders to achieve world-class status during the era, besides Botham himself, have included Keith Miller, Richie Benaud, Mike Procter, Clive Rice, Imran Khan, Kapil Dev and Andrew Flintoff.|$|E
25|$|Buenos Aires {{is one of}} the world's great {{capitals of}} theater. The Teatro Colón is a {{national}} landmark for opera and classical performances; built {{at the end of the}} 19th century, its acoustics are considered the best in the world, and is currently undergoing a major refurbishment in order to preserve its outstanding sound characteristics, the French-romantic style, the impressive Golden Room (a minor auditorium targeted to Chamber Music performances), and the museum at the entrance. With its theatre scene of national and international caliber, Corrientes Avenue is synonymous with the art. It is thought of as the street that never sleeps, and sometimes referred to as the Broadway of Buenos Aires. Many great careers in acting, music, and film have begun in its many theaters. The Teatro General San Martín {{is one of the}} most prestigious, along Corrientes Avenue, and the Teatro Nacional Cervantes functions as the national stage theater of Argentina. The Teatro Argentino de La Plata, El Círculo in Rosario, Independencia in Mendoza, and Libertador in Córdoba are also prominent. Griselda Gambaro, Copi, Roberto Cossa, Marco Denevi, Carlos Gorostiza, and Alberto Vaccarezza are a few of the more prominent Argentine playwrights.
