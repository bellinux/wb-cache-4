40|$|Neutron and gamma {{detectors}} of the CSIRO {{air cargo}} scanner {{are based on}} scintillators readout by photodiodes (PD). The <b>scanner</b> <b>imaging</b> resolution {{is limited by the}} scintillator size. It, in turns, is limited by the number of interactions that can be detected by the PD. Silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) could be used in place of PDs to improve the neutron and gamma detector efficiency. It would ultimately improve the scanner performance in terms of speed, cargo size and image quality. Efficient use of SiPM requires gain stabilisation and dark counts suppression. This work presents a technique to strip the dark counts and the electronic noise off the genuine source-induced spectrum.

To develop and test a recognition method an outcrop of limestone with chert nodules was scanned with an IR (1541 nm) TLS. The intensity information, after proper distance correction, was coupled with geometric and intensity descriptors for training Support Vector Machines (SVM) to separate vegetation from rock and limestone from chert.

40|$|Intensity {{normalization}} is {{an important}} preprocessing step in magnetic resonance (MR) image analysis. In MR images (MRI), the observed intensities are primarily dependent on (1) intrinsic magnetic resonance properties of the tissues such as proton density (PD), longitudinal and transverse relaxation times (T 1 and T 2 respectively), and (2) the <b>scanner</b> <b>imaging</b> parameters like echo time (TE), repeat time (TR), and flip angle (α). We propose a method which utilizes three co-registered images with different contrast mechanisms (PD-weighted, T 2 -weighted and T 1 -weighted) to first estimate the imaging parameters and then estimate PD, T 1, and T 2 values. We then normalize the subject intensities to a reference by simply applying the pulse sequence equation of the reference image to the subject tissue parameters. Previous approaches {{to solve this problem}} have primarily focused on matching the intensity histograms of the subject image to a reference histogram by different methods. The fundamental drawback of these methods is their failure to respect the underlying imaging physics and tissue biology. Our method is validated on phantoms and we show improvement of normalization on real images of human brains.

40|$|Abstract—We have {{developed}} a flying-spot scanner (FSS), for fluorescence imaging of tissues in vivo. The FSS {{is based on the}} principles of single-pixel illumination and detection via a raster scanning technique. The principal components of the scanner are a laser light source, a pair of horizontal and vertical scanning mir-rors to deflect the laser light in these respective directions on the tissue surface, and a photo multiplier tube (PMT) detector. This paper characterizes the performance of the FSS for fluorescence imaging of tissues in vivo. First, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) anal-ysis is presented. This is followed by characterization of the experi-mental SNR, linearity and spatial resolution of the FSS. Finally, the feasibility of tissue fluorescence imaging is demonstrated using an animal model. In summary, the performance of the FSS is compa-rable to that of fluorescence-imaging systems based on multipixel illumination and detection. The primary advantage of the FSS is the order-of-magnitude reduction in the cost of the light source and detector. However, the primary disadvantage of the FSS its signifi-cantly slower frame rate (1 Hz). In applications where high frame rates are not critical, the FSS will represent a low-cost alternative to multichannel fluorescence imaging-systems.

The forearm skin blood flow(SBF) response to Ach applied by iontophoresis was determined using a laser-Doppler <b>scanner</b> <b>imaging</b> system before(T 0) and 3 hours(T 3) after N or A dosing, both on the first (Day 1) and the last day (Day 8) of treatment.

DCE-MR imaging modeling techniques can produce a measurement of the ve, which would also be expected to have an inverse relationship with cell density. The objective {{of this study was to}} test the hypothesis that areas of increased cellularity, and therefore low ADC, would be expected to have a small EES (low ve). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients with GBM were recruited. All imaging was performed before surgery on a 3 T MR imaging <b>scanner.</b> <b>Imaging</b> included diffusion tensor imaging, T 1 -weighted DCE-MR imaging, and anatomic sequences. Tumor VOIs were defined on the anatomic images and modified to contain only enhancing voxels. Parametric maps of ADC and ve were generated. Statistical analysis of ADC and ve was performed on both a voxel-by-voxel basis and comparison of median values. RESULTS: No correlation was demonstrated between ADC and ve in either a voxel-by-voxel analysis or comparison of median values (P. 124). CONCLUSIONS: This study failed to demonstrate a correlation between ADC and ve. This is important because it suggests that though the mechanisms underlying these parameters are theoretically similar, they actually reflect different aspects of tumor microenvironment. Consequently ADC and ve should be considered to provide independent information about the properties of the EES.

40|$|As {{the limits}} of stimuli {{presentation}} rates are explored in event-related fMRI design, {{there is a greater}} need to assess the implications of averaging raw fMRI data. Selective averaging assumes that the fMRI signal consists of task-dependent signal, random noise, and non-task dependent brain signal that can be modeled as random noise so that it tends to zero when averaged over a practical number of trials. We recorded a total of four fMRI data series from two normal subjects (subject 1, axially acquired; subject 2, coronally acquired) performing a simple visual event-related task and a water phantom with the same fMRI <b>scanner</b> <b>imaging</b> parameters. To determine which fraction of the fMRI data was deterministic as opposed to random, we created different data subsets by taking the odd or even time points of the full data sets. All data sets were first dimension-reduced with principal component analysis (PCA) and separated into 100 spatially independent components with independent component analysis (ICA). The mutual information between best-matching pairs of components selected from full data set/subset comparisons was plotted for each data set. Visual inspection suggested that 45 / 85 components were reproducible, and hence deterministic, accounting for 79 / 97 % of the variance, respectively, in the raw data. The reproducible components exhibited much less trial-to-trial variability than the raw data from even the most activated voxel.

40|$|National audienceSurface {{displacement}} field of landslides {{is a key}} parameter to access to their geometries and mechanical properties. Surface displacements can be calculated using remote-sensing methods such as interferometry for radar data and image correlation for optical data. These methods have been elaborated this last decade and successfully applied on sensors (radar, cameras, terrestrial 3 D laser <b>scanner</b> <b>imaging)</b> either attached to space or aerial platforms such as satellites, planes, and unmanned radio-controlled platforms (drones and helicopters) or settled at fixed positions emplaced {{in the front of}} landslides. This paper reviews the techniques of image analysis (interferometry and optical data correlation) to measure displacements and examines the performance of each type of platforms. Examples of applications of these techniques in French South Alps are shown. Depending on the landslide characteristics (exposure conditions, size, velocity) as well as the goal of the study (operational or scientific purpose), one or a combination of several techniques and data (characterized by several resolution, accuracy, covered surface, revisiting time) have to be used. Radar satellite data processed with differential interferometric or PS methods are mainly suitable for scientific purposes due to various application limitations in mountainous area. Optical satellite and aerial images can be used for scientific studies at fairly high resolution but are strongly dependant on atmospheric conditions. Platforms and sensors such as drone, fixed camera, fixed radar and Lidar have the advantage of high adaptability.

40|$|Neuroimaging {{studies suggest}} anterior-limbic {{structural}} brain abnormalities {{in patients with}} bipolar disorder (BD), but few studies have shown these abnormalities in unaffected but genetically liable family members. In this study, we report morphometric correlates of genetic risk for BD using voxel-based morphometry. In 35 BD type I (BD-I) patients, 20 unaffected first-degree relatives (UAR) of BD patients and 40 healthy control subjects underwent 3 T magnetic resonance <b>scanner</b> <b>imaging.</b> Preprocessing of images used DARTEL (diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated lie algebra) for voxel-based morphometry in SPM 8 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK). The whole-brain analysis revealed that the gray matter (GM) volumes of the left anterior insula and right inferior frontal gyrus showed {{a significant main effect}} of diagnosis. Multiple comparison analysis showed that the BD-I patients and the UAR subjects had smaller left anterior insular GM volumes compared with the healthy subjects, the BD-I patients had smaller right inferior frontal gyrus compared with the healthy subjects. For white matter (WM) volumes, there was a significant main effect of diagnosis for medial frontal gyrus. The UAR subjects had smaller right medial frontal WM volumes compared with the healthy subjects. These findings suggest that morphometric brain abnormalities of the anterior-limbic neural substrate are associated with family history of BD, which may give insight into the pathophysiology of BD, and be a potential candidate as a morphological endophenotype of BD.

40|$|Introduction: Current {{studies have}} {{compared}} indirect bonding with direct placement of orthodontic brackets; {{many of these}} have shown that indirect bonding is generally a more accurate technique. However, the reproducibility of an indirect bonding setup by an orthodontist {{has yet to be}} described in the literature. Using cone-beam computed tomography and computer-assisted modeling software, we evaluated the consistency of orthodontists in placing orthodontic brackets at different times. Methods: Five orthodontists with experience in indirect bonding were selected to place brackets on 10 different casts at 3 time periods (n 5 30 per orthodontist). Each participant completed an initial indirect bonding setup on each cast; subsequent bracket placements were completed twice at monthly intervals for comparison with the initial setup. The casts were scanned using an iCAT cone-beam computed tomography <b>scanner</b> (<b>Imaging</b> Sciences International, Hatfield, Pa) and imported into Geomagic Studio software (Geomagic, Research Triangle Park, NC) for superimposition and analysis. The scans for each time period were superimposed on the initial setup in the imaging software, and differences between bracket positions were calculated. For each superimposition, the measurements recorded were the greatest discrepancies between individual brackets as well as the mean discrepancies and standard deviations between all brackets on each cast. Results: Single-factor and repeated-measure analysis of variance showed no statistically significant differences between time points of each orthodontist, or among the orthodontists for the parameters measured. The mean discrepancy was 0. 1 mm for each 10 -bracket indirect bonding setup.

40|$|The paper reports an {{important}} achievement in MRI instrumentation, a pneumatic, fully actuated robot {{located within the}} scanner alongside the patient and operating under remote control based on the images. Previous MRI robots commonly used piezoelectric actuation limiting their compatibility. Pneumatics is an ideal choice for MRI compatibility because it is decoupled from electromagnetism, but pneumatic actuators were hardly controllable. This achievement was possible due to a recent technology breakthrough, the invention of {{a new type of}} pneumatic motor, PneuStep (1), designed for the robot reported here with uncompromised MRI compatibility, high-precision, and medical safety. MrBot is one of the ‘‘MRI stealth’ ’ robots today (the second is described in this issue by Zangos et al.). Both of these systems are also multi-imager compatible, being able to operate with the imager of choice or cross-imaging modalities. For MRI compatibility the robot is exclusively constructed of nonmagnetic and dielectric materials such as plastics, ceramics, crystals, rubbers and is electricity free. Light-based encoding is used for feedback, so that all electric components are distally located outside the imager’s room. MRI robots are modern, digital medical instruments in line with advanced imaging equipment and methods.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{clinical}} value of [11 C]methionine-PET (MET-PET) for detection and localization of parathyroid adenomas in patients without prior thyroidectomy. Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients with suspected hyperparathyroidism undergoing imaging with MET-PET was performed. Prior thyroidectomy was an exclusion criterion. 41 patients with a total of 49 MET-PET scans were included. MET-PET consisted of whole-body images obtained 15 - 20 min after injection of 430 ± 81 MBq of MET using a dedicated PET <b>scanner.</b> <b>Imaging</b> findings were validated by histology or other imaging studies and clinical follow-up on a lesion, side and location basis. Comparison of PET results to other imaging modalities including ultrasound, MIBI scintigraphy and morphological imaging (CT and/or MRI) and subgroup analysis of primary vs. secondary hyperparathyroidism was performed. Results: 23 / 49 PET scans revealed pathologic findings, whereas 26 / 49 scans were negative. Validation of PET findings for detection and localization of hyperthyroidism resulted in an overall sensitivity of MET-PET of 54 %, 49 % and 35 % on a lesion, side and location basis, respectively. Sensitivity of MET-PET was inferior compared to ultrasonography (50 % vs. 93 %), MIBI scintigraphy (53 % vs. 74 %) and morphological imaging (52 % vs. 74 %). Subgroup analysis revealed higher sensitivity for MET-PET in sHPT than pHPT (62 % vs. 43 %; side basis). Conclusions: In patients with initial diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism and no prior thyroidectomy, the sensitivity of MET-PET for detection and localization of hyperparathyroidism is markedly lower compared to previous reports. While performance was better in sHPT, MET-PET can not be recommended for pHPT localization in this clinically relevant subcollective...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMimic near-surface seismic field {{measurements}} {{at a small}} scale, in the laboratory, under a well-controlled environment, {{may lead to a}} better understanding of wave propagation in complex media such as in geological materials. Laboratory experiments can help in particular to constrain and refine theoretical and numerical modelling of physical phenomena occurring during seismic propagation, in order to make a better use of the complete set of measurements recorded in the field. We have developed a laser Doppler vibrometer (laser interferometry) platform designed to measure non-contact seismic displacements (or velocities) of a surface. This technology enables to measure displacements as small as a tenth of a nanometer on a wide range of frequencies, from a few tenths to a few megahertz. Our experimental setup is particularly suited to provide high-density spatial and temporal records of displacements on the edge of any vibrating material. We will show in particular a study of MHz wave propagation (excited by piezoelectric transducers) in cylindrical cores of typical diameter size around 10 cm. The laser vibrometer measurements will be first validated in homogeneous materials cylinders by comparing the measurements to a direct numerical simulation. Special attention will be given to the comparison of experimental versus numerical amplitudes of displacements. In a second step, we will conduct the same type of study through heterogeneous carbonate cores, possibly fractured. Tomographic images of velocity in 2 D slices of the carbonate core will be derived based upon on the time of first arrival. Preliminary attempts of tomographic attenuation maps will also be presented based on the amplitudes of first arrivals.

40|$|Background: This multi-site study compares resting state fMRI {{amplitude}} of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) between patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and healthy controls (HC). Methods: Eyes-closed resting fMRI scans (5 : 38 min; n = 306, 146 SZ) {{were collected from}} 6 Siemens 3 T scanners and one GE 3 T <b>scanner.</b> <b>Imaging</b> data were pre-processed using an SPM pipeline. Power in the low frequency band (0. 01 – 0. 08 Hz) was calculated both for the original pre-processed data {{as well as for}} the pre-processed data after regressing out the six rigid-body motion parameters, mean white matter (WM) and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) signals. Both original and regressed ALFF and fALFF measures were modeled with site, diagnosis, age, and diagnosis × age interactions. Results: Regressing out motion and non-gray matter signals significantly decreased fALFF throughout the brain as well as ALFF in the cortical edge, but significantly increased ALFF in subcortical regions. Regression had little effect on site, age, and diagnosis effects on ALFF, other than to reduce diagnosis effects in subcortical regions. There were significant effects of site across the brain in all the analyses, largely due to vendor differences. HC showed greater ALFF in the occipital, posterior parietal, and superior temporal lobe, while SZ showed smaller clusters of greater ALFF in the frontal and temporal/insular regions as well as in the caudate, putamen, and hippocampus. HC showed greater fALFF compared with SZ in all regions, though subcortical differences were only significant for original fALFF. Conclusions: SZ show greater eyes-closed resting state low frequency power in frontal cortex, and less power in posterior lobes than do HC; fALFF, however, is lower in SZ than HC throughout the cortex. These effects are robust to multi-site variability. Regressing out physiological noise signals significantly affects both total and fALFF measures, but does not affect the pattern of case/control differences...|$|E

When used at low frequencies, a number of drawbacks arise that drastically reduce their overall performances. In this article we show how the choice of the conductors cross-geometry and capacitor quality affects the coil overall performance. Several birdcage coils, tuned at 7. 66 MHz, were designed and built, using conductors with different shapes and capacitors with different quality factors. Realized coils were tested and character-ized by laboratory workbench in order to extract several quality indices. In addition, experi-ments were done in a real magnetic resonance (MR) scanner to evaluate the field homogeneity.
