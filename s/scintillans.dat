25|$|Henry Vaughan (17 April 1621 – 23 April 1695) was a Welsh metaphysical poet, author, {{translator}} and physician, {{who wrote}} in English. He is chiefly known for the religious poetry contained in Silex <b>Scintillans,</b> published in 1650, with a second part published in 1655.|$|E
2500|$|Certainly Vaughan {{would have}} never written {{the way he did}} without Herbert's direction. The {{explicit}} spiritual influence here is undeniable, and is all but proclaimed in the preface to Silex <b>Scintillans.</b> The prose of Vaughan exemplifies this as well. For instance, The Temple, by Herbert, is often seen as the inspiration and model on which Vaughan created his work. Silex <b>Scintillans</b> is most often classed with this collection of Herbert's. Silex <b>Scintillans</b> borrows the same themes, experience, and beliefs as The Temple. Herbert's influence is evident both in the shape and spirituality of Vaughan's poetry.

2500|$|The {{first volume}} of Silex <b>Scintillans</b> was {{followed}} by The Mount of Olives, or Solitary Devotions (1652), a prose book of devotions. It provides prayers for different stages of the day, for prayer in church, and for other purposes. It is written as a [...] "companion volume" [...] to the Book of Common Prayer, to which it alludes frequently, {{though it had been}} outlawed under the Commonwealth. The work was also influenced by Lancelot Andrewes's Preces Privatae (1615) and John Cosin's Collection of Private Devotions (1627). Flores Solitudinis (1654) contains translations from the Latin of two works by the Spanish Jesuit Juan Eusebio Nieremberg, one by a 5th-century Bishop of Lyon, Eucherius, and by Paulinus of Nola, of whom Vaughan wrote a prose life.|$|E
2500|$|Surprisingly, {{given their}} ability to change color, all octopodes and most {{cephalopods}} {{are considered to be}} color blind. [...] Coleoid cephalopods (octopus, squid, cuttlefish) have a single photoreceptor type and lack the ability to determine color by comparing detected photon intensity across multiple spectral channels. [...] When camouflaging themselves, they use their chromatophores to change brightness and pattern according to the background they see, but {{their ability to}} match the specific color of a background may come from cells such as iridophores and leucophores that reflect light from the environment. [...] They also produce visual pigments throughout their body, and may sense light levels directly from their body. Evidence of color vision has been found in the sparkling enope squid (Watasenia <b>scintillans),</b> which achieves color vision by the use of three distinct retinal molecules (A1, sensitive to red; A2, to purple, and A4, to yellow?) which bind to its opsin.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{not until}} the writing of Silex <b>Scintillans</b> that Vaughan {{received}} significant acclaim. The period shortly preceding the publication of the first volume of this work (1650) marked an important period of his life. Certain indications in the first volume and explicit statements in the preface to the second volume (1655) suggest that Vaughan suffered a prolonged sickness that inflicted much pain. Vaughan interprets this experience to be an encounter with death that alerted him to a [...] "misspent youth". Vaughan believed he had been spared to make amends and start a new course not only in his life but in the literature he would produce. He described his previous work as foul and a contribution to [...] "corrupt literature". Perhaps the most notable mark of Vaughan's conversion is how much it is credited to George Herbert. Vaughan claims he is the least of Herbert's many [...] "pious converts". It was during this period of Vaughan's life, around 1650, that he adopted the saying [...] "moriendo, revixi" [...] – [...] "by dying, I gain new life".|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{distinct}} difference between the atmosphere Vaughan attempts to convey in this work and in his most famous work, Silex <b>Scintillans.</b> Olor Iscanus is a direct representation of a specific period in Vaughan's life, which emphasises other secular writers and provides allusions to debt and happy living. A fervent topic of Vaughan throughout these poems is the Civil War and reveals Vaughan's somewhat paradoxical thinking {{that in the end}} does not indicate whether he participated or not. Vaughan states his complete satisfaction at being clean of [...] "innocent blood", but also provides what seem to be eyewitness accounts of battles and his own [...] "soldiery". Although Vaughan is thought to have been a royalist, these poems express contempt for all current authority and a lack of zeal for the royalist cause. His poems generally reflect a sense of severe decline, which may mean that Vaughan lamented the effects of the war on the monarchy and society. His short poem [...] "The Timber", ostensibly about a dead tree, concludes ...|$|E
2500|$|Luminescent Dinoflagellates: In early 1954 at Northwestern University, Hastings, his {{students}} and colleagues studied cellular and molecular aspects of bioluminescence in dinoflagellates [...] They elucidated {{the structures of}} the luciferins and luciferases, the organization and regulation of their associated genes, temporal control mechanisms, and the actual sub-cellular identity and location of the light emitting elements, which they termed scintillons. They demonstrated that the reaction is controlled by a drop in pH when an action potential leads to the entry of protons via voltage-activated membrane channels in the scintillons. Through immunolocalization studies the Hastings lab showed that scintillons are small peripheral vesicles (0.4 μm) that contain both the luciferase and the luciferin-binding protein. More recently, the lab found that the luciferase gene in Lingulodinium polyedrum and other closely related species contains three homologous and contiguous repeated sequences {{in a kind of}} [...] "three-ring circus with the same act in all three." [...] However, another luminescent, but heterotrophic, dinoflagellate, Noctiluca <b>scintillans,</b> has but a single protein, which appears to possess both catalytic and substrate binding properties in a single, rather than separate proteins.|$|E
