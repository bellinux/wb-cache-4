5|$|There are two <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> {{the name}} of this altar came about. The first states that those {{condemned}} by the Spanish Inquisition were brought to the altar to ask for forgiveness in the next world before their execution. The second relates to painter Simon Pereyns, who despite being the author of many of the works of the cathedral, was accused of blasphemy. According to the story, while Pereyns was in jail, he painted such a beautiful image of the Virgin Mary that his crime was forgiven.|$|E
5|$|Disaster {{strikes at}} the press event. The craft {{apparently}} draws power from the broadcasting equipment, and its influence is magnified. The streets of London erupt into violence as those affected go on a rampage. Breen becomes drawn towards the craft and is killed. Quatermass falls under the alien control as well, but is snapped out of it by Roney, who is unaffected. The two men realise that {{a small portion of}} the population are immune. The psychic energy becomes stronger, ripping up streets and buildings, and the spectral image of a Martian towers above the city, centred on Hobbs End. Recalling <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the Devil could be defeated with iron and water, Roney theorises the Martian energy could be discharged into the earth. Roney climbs to the top of a building crane and swings it into the spectre. The crane bursts into flames as it discharges the energy, killing Roney, but the image disappears.|$|E
5|$|The premiere {{took place}} at the EPCOR Centre for the Performing Arts in Calgary in February 2011. Performances were {{scheduled}} to run on the centre's Motel stage between February 23 and March 5. Tickets quickly sold out. Four days after the premiere, Burnt Thicket Theatre moved the play to the Scott Block Theatre in Red Deer, where the play was scheduled to be performed until March 12. All the performances in Red Deer were sold out. The play drew emotional reactions from the audience. Kooman learned that some audience members at the initial performances later responded to the play by talking with others about human trafficking, writing letters to their Members of Parliament, and doing other creative things on the subject. They also contacted Waldschmidt, sometimes up to a year later, with <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the play had continued to affect their lives. In conjunction with the initial run of She Has a Name, Burnt Thicket Theatre provided the names of organizations that assist human-trafficking victims. There was also a panel discussion about human trafficking after the matinée on February 26.|$|E

25|$|On 31 March, Queensland Police {{contacted}} the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) {{and gave it}} the details that Rau had provided. DIMIA said {{that it had no}} records of the arrival of any person called Anna Brotmeyer. The police returned to the Exchange Hotel, but Rau had left, and they later found her about fifteen kilometres north of the town, where they ordered her back to the Coen police station. There she gave several different <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> and when she entered the country, none of them consistent. The police again contacted DIMIA, which advised them to detain Rau as a suspected unlawful non-citizen under the provisions of the Migration Act 1958. Rau was searched, and had a Norwegian passport, a book with two names (both different from Anna and Cornelia) on it, and A$2,413 in her possession. Later that day she was driven from Coen to Cairns.|$|E

500|$|Decades later, {{after the}} {{practical}} demonstration of motorjets and turbojets, Coandă {{began to tell}} various conflicting <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> his early experiments were precursors to the jet, even that his turbo-propulseur was the first motorjet engine with fuel combustion in the airstream. He also claimed {{to have made a}} single brief flight in December 1910, crashing just after takeoff, the aircraft being destroyed by fire. Two aviation historians countered Coandă's version of events, saying there was no proof that the engine had combustion in the airstream, and no proof that the aircraft ever flew. In 1965, Coandă brought drawings forward to prove his claim of combustion ducting but these were shown to be reworked, differing substantially from the originals. Many aviation historians were dismissive, saying that Coandă's turbo-propulseur design involved a weak stream of [...] "plain air", not a powerful jet of air expanding from fuel combustion.|$|E

500|$|The {{films of}} Paul Thomas Anderson have been {{compared}} to it. Variety compared There Will Be Blood to the film and called it [...] "one that rivals Giant and Citizen Kane in our popular lore as origin <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> we came to be the people we are." [...] The Master has been called [...] "movieland's only spiritual sequel to Citizen Kane that doesn't shrivel under the hefty comparison" [...] and the film's loose depiction of L. Ron Hubbard has {{been compared to}} Citizen Kanes depiction of Hearst. The Social Network {{has been compared to}} the film for its depiction of a media mogul and by the character Erica Albright being similar to [...] "Rosebud". The controversy of the Sony hacking before the release of The Interview brought comparisons of Hearst's attempt to suppress the film. The film's plot structure and some specific shots influenced Todd Haynes's Velvet Goldmine. Abbas Kiarostami's The Traveler has been called [...] "the Citizen Kane of the Iranian children's cinema." [...] The film's use of overlapping dialogue has influenced the films of Robert Altman and Carol Reed. Reed's films Odd Man Out, The Third Man (in which Welles and Cotten appeared) and Outcast of the Islands were also influenced by the film's cinematography.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{this account}} has been disputed by George Winstanley, the first clerk to the Cabinet after independence. [...] He insists that <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the {{government}} was pressured into ratifying [...] "Fatshe leno la rona" [...] are simply inaccurate, {{especially in light of}} the fact that the civil servants who supposedly did this were merely [...] "junior executive officers" [...] at the time. [...] Rather, Winstanley remembers how Seretse Khama initially leaned towards selecting [...] "Morena" [...] ("Lord keep the nation of the world"), before he convinced Khama to select a hymn that was [...] "unique to Botswana". [...] Khama's deputy Quett Masire recalled how the future president wanted an anthem that was enduring and would transcend the political spectrum, so that it would not be changed when another political party assumed power in the future.|$|E
2500|$|It seems {{from this}} {{evidence}} that the Homeridae were a guild of oral performers (rhapsodes, as implied by Pindar's phrase [...] "singers of stitched words") who claimed to inherit Homer's tradition and performed poems ascribed to Homer, no doubt including the Iliad and Odyssey. They also developed <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the poems had originated, such as Homer's dream of Helen. Like other rhapsodes, they travelled widely, but they were perhaps based on Chios. Certain Homeridae were active in adding new poems to the tradition. It {{is worth noting that}} due to the Peisistratos that Homeric reformation became compulsory. The Homeridae, like other rhapsodes, switched to a designated text which they themselves had approved. In this way, the Homeridae became the authors of some of the first [...] "authoritative" [...] versions of Homeric poetry, and removed much of the improvisation which had hitherto characterized the art form.|$|E
