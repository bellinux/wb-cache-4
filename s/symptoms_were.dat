5|$|In 2004, {{a captive}} yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} and two free-living tawny frogmouths (Podargus strigoides) suffering neurological <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> {{shown to be}} hosting the rat nematode Angiostrongylus cantonensis. They were the first non-mammalian hosts discovered for the organism. A species of feather mite, Psittophagus calyptorhynchi, has also been isolated from the yellow-tailed black cockatoo, its only host to date.|$|E
5|$|In a {{large-scale}} study of programs where bupropion {{was used for}} smoking cessation or treatment of depression, no withdrawal <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> observed. As of 2002 there were two case reports of people experiencing withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing buproprion taken to aid smoking cessation; the prescribing information states that dose tapering is not required when discontinuing treatment for smoking cessation.|$|E
5|$|Medieval and Renaissance {{surgeons}} {{continued the}} practice of trepanation for head injury. In the Middle Ages, physicians further described head injury symptoms and the term concussion became more widespread. Concussion <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> first described systematically in the 16thcentury by Berengario da Carpi.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> {{coughing}} and other typical <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> wheezing and weight loss. These <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> caused by larvae that {{reside in the}} lungs where immunity develops and the accumulation of mucus cause blockage of the airway into the lungs.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> a bump {{formed by}} the bite, {{eventually}} resulting in a black, crusty scab. Many of the <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> flu-like including fever, chills, weakness and achy muscles but the most distinctive <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> the rash that breaks out, spanning the infected person's entire body.|$|R
5|$|On {{the basis}} of symptoms, it is {{possible}} to distinguish HSP from hypersensitivity vasculitis (HV). In a series comparing 85 HSP patients with 93 HV patients, five <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> found to be indicative of HSP: palpable purpura, abdominal angina, digestive tract hemorrhage (not due to intussussception), hematuria and age less than 20. The presence of three or more of these indicators has an 87% sensitivity for predicting HSP.|$|E
5|$|Once it was {{recognized}} that the <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> caused by gas bubbles, and that re-compression could relieve the symptoms, Paul Bert showed in 1878 that decompression sickness is caused by nitrogen bubbles released from tissues and blood during or after decompression, and showed the advantages of breathing oxygen after developing decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|The {{occurrence}} of disturbed behaviour {{in people with}} jaundice may have been described in antiquity by Hippocrates of Cos (ca. 460–370BCE). Celsus and Galen (first and third century respectively) both recognised the condition. Many modern descriptions {{of the link between}} liver disease and neuropsychiatric <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> made in the eighteenth and nineteenth century; for instance, Giovanni Battista Morgagni (1682–1771) reported in 1761 that it was a progressive condition.|$|E
5|$|Psychiatric {{problems}} due to Wilson's {{disease may}} include behavioral changes, depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. Psychiatric <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> commonly seen {{in conjunction with}} neurological <b>symptoms</b> and <b>are</b> rarely manifested on their own. These <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> often poorly defined and can sometimes be attributed to other causes. Because of this, diagnosis of Wilson's disease is rarely made when only psychiatric <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> present.|$|R
50|$|The core {{symptoms}} of schizophrenia {{can be classified}} into three broad categories. These <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> often used to build and study animal models of schizophrenia {{in the field of}} epigenetics. Positive <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> considered limbic system aberrations, while negative and cognitive <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> thought of as frontal lobe abnormalities.|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the effect of client resistance and reactance in the counselling process and methods for assessing these phenomena. In addition, client <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> conceptualized as either ego-syntonic, where the <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> consonant with the client's self-image, or as ego-dystonic, where the <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> dissonant from the client's self-image. These concepts are then used in deriving counselling strategies for working with difficult clients according to a model that crosses high and low reactance with ego syntonicity-dystonicity. According to this model, the least difficult clients are those whose reactance is low and whose <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> ego-dystonic. The most difficult clients are those whose reactance is high and whose <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> ego-syntonic. Clients whose reactance is low and whose <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> ego-syntonic or whose reactance is high and whose <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> ego-dystonic are moderately difficult. Counselling interventions designed for clients {{in each of the}} four categories are described.

5|$|Two of the {{patients}} at Samut Prakan Hospital were admitted to the surgical ward, while the other {{was admitted to the}} medical ward. All were nauseated and vomiting, and two of them were showing leukopenia (low white blood cell count). Reviewing the cases on 18 February, the doctors realized their <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> likely caused by radiation exposure, and notified the OAEP.|$|E
5|$|A second form of neuroacanthocytosis, Levine-Critchley syndrome, was {{discovered}} by the American internist Irvine M. Levine in 1960 and reported in Neurology in 1964, and again in 1968. Subsequently, similar <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> identified and described by the British neurologist MacDonald Critchley in 1968. In both cases, the physicians described a hereditary syndrome that combined acanthocytosis with neurological peculiarities but normal serum lipoprotein. Specific symptoms included tics, grimacing, movement disorders, difficulty swallowing, poor coordination, hyporeflexia, chorea, and seizures. Patients often mutilated their tongues, lips, and cheeks. The diseases appeared in both sexes, and were usually diagnosed in infancy.|$|E
5|$|Later that day, Lt. Milton R. Rubb and his {{electronics}} technician team {{returned the}} fathometer to operational status, and the Chief Engineer Donald D. Fears, Reactor Officer Lt. Cmdr. Robert P. McDonald, and Tritons engineering crew repaired the malfunctioning reactor. Since Poole's <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> intermittent, Triton continued south, {{although there was}} a detour to the Golfo Nuevo region when the ship investigated an unknown sonar contact. Contemporary news accounts reported the Argentine Navy had been encountering numerous unknown submarine contacts in the Golfo Nuevo during early 1960, but Tritons contact {{turned out to be a}} school of fish.|$|E
40|$|We {{reviewed}} {{evidence for}} utility of analogue samples in understanding OC symptoms. • OC <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> sufficiently prevalent in non-clinical samples. • OC <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> dimensional rather than categorical in frequency and severity. • Qualitative aspects of OC <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> similar in clinical and nonclinical samples. • Similar causal and maintenance factors occur in clinical and nonclinical samples...|$|R

2500|$|In a syndrome, {{a set of}} <b>symptoms</b> <b>is</b> {{consistently}} present, and <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> linked {{such that}} the presence of one symptom suggests that of others. [...] Because PCS <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> so varied and many can be associated with a large number of other conditions, doubt exists about whether the term [...] "syndrome" [...] is appropriate for the constellation of symptoms found after concussion. The fact that the persistence of one <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> not necessarily linked to that of another has similarly led to doubt about whether [...] "syndrome" [...] is the appropriate term.|$|R
5|$|The first {{recorded}} experimental work related to decompression {{was conducted by}} Robert Boyle, who subjected experimental animals to reduced ambient pressure by use of a primitive vacuum pump. In the earliest experiments the subjects died from asphyxiation, but in later experiments, signs of what was later to become known as decompression sickness were observed. Later, when technological advances allowed the use of pressurisation of mines and caissons to exclude water ingress, miners were observed to present symptoms of what would become known as caisson disease, the bends, and decompression sickness. Once it was recognized that the <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> caused by gas bubbles, and that recompression could relieve the symptoms, further work showed {{that it was possible}} to avoid symptoms by slow decompression, and subsequently various theoretical models have been derived to predict low-risk decompression profiles and treatment of decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the NFL {{established}} the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee (MTBI), which was later {{replaced by the}} Head, Neck and Spine Committee, to study concussions and brain injuries in professional football players. The committee and its leadership, including Ira Casson and Elliot Pellman, were criticized by former players for stating {{that there is not}} enough research to determine if concussions lead to permanent brain injury. Pellman, who served as chairman of the committee from 1994 to 2007, received a large amount of criticism because {{he did not have a}} background in neurology and the research he published on brain injuries disagreed with the findings of independent scientists. In 2009, a NFL-commissioned report showed increased incidence of diagnosis of memory loss and dementia among retired professional football players when compared to the general population. The study also indicated that these <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> related to the effects of concussions. However, the NFL and the report's own researchers questioned the reliability of some of the data-gathering methods employed by the study, including the fact that the study was conducted by phone. The same year, the committee acknowledged for the first time that concussions can lead to long-term brain injuries. A Congressional hearing in October 2009, as well as pressure from the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), led to an overhaul of the concussion policy in November and December of that year.|$|E

25|$|This {{abridged}} {{version of the}} K-SADS focuses on mania and is a combination/modification of Geller's WASH-U-KSADS and the 4th revision of the KSADS-P (by Joaquim Puig-Antich and Neal Ryan) Specifically, it assess 21 symptoms related to mania, hypomania, and rapid cycling. Each item is rated on a 0-6 rating scale. Scores of 0 suggest no information is available; scores of 1 suggest the <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> not present at all; scores of 2 suggest the <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> slightly present; scores of 3 suggest the <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> mildly severe; scores of 4 suggest the <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> moderately severe; scores of 5 suggest the <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> severe; and scores of 6 suggest the <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> extremely severe. Items with scores of 4 or higher are clinically significant/maladaptive. Trained clinicians or clinical researchers administer the assessment to both {{the child and the}} parent, which each provide their own separate score for each item (P and C), and the total score encompasses the sum of all of the items (S).|$|R

25|$|Feelings of {{depression}} {{can cause a}} child to overeat. Researchers provided an in-home interview to 9,374 adolescents, in grades seven through 12 and discovered {{that there was not}} a direct correlation with children eating in response to depression. Of all the obese adolescents, 8.2% had said to be depressed, compared to 8.9% of the non-obese adolescents who said they were depressed. Antidepressants, however, seem to have very little influence on childhood obesity. Researchers provided a depression questionnaire to 487 overweight/obese subjects and found that 7% of those with low depression <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.3, 27% of those with moderate depression <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.7, and 31% of those with major depression <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.2.|$|E
25|$|F. magna {{infections in}} {{definitive}} hosts are usually subclinical. However, massive deaths {{caused by the}} fluke in red-, fallow- and roe deer were reported. Lethargy, depression, weight loss and decreased quality of antlers can occur sporadically. In addition, nervous <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> observed very rarely. In the first case, urging motion followed by apathy was reported in one experimentally infected fallow deer. Authors suggested that these <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> associated with hepatocerebral syndrome.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the neurological abnorm-alities of Parkinsonism {{can be divided into}} positive and negative symptoms (Martin, 1967). Positive <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> considered to be release phenomena. Pathological changes within one region of the central nervous system result in the release of this region's control over a second region.
