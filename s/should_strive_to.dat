5|$|All {{variations}} of the argument from morality begin with an observation about moral thought or experiences and conclude with the existence of God. Some of these arguments propose moral facts which they claim evident through human experience, arguing that God is the best explanation for these.

5|$|In the Rights of Men, Wollstonecraft {{not only}} endorses republicanism, {{but also a}} social {{contract}} based on sympathy and fellow-feeling. She describes the ideal society in these terms: individuals, supported by cohesive families, connect with others through rational sympathy. Strongly influenced by Price, whom she had met at Newington Green {{just a few years}} earlier, Wollstonecraft asserts that people <b>should</b> <b>strive</b> <b>to</b> imitate God by practicing universal benevolence.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{marriage}} in the Bahá'i faith is mainly to foster spiritual harmony, fellowship and unity {{between a man and}} a woman and to provide a stable and loving environment for the rearing of children. The Bahá'í teachings on marriage call it a fortress for well-being and salvation and place marriage and the family as the foundation of the structure of human society. Bahá'u'lláh highly praised marriage, discouraged divorce, and required chastity outside of marriage; Bahá'u'lláh taught that a husband and wife <b>should</b> <b>strive</b> <b>to</b> improve the spiritual life of each other. Interracial marriage is also highly praised throughout Bahá'í scripture.|$|E

50|$|The through line, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} the spine, was first suggested by Constantin Stanislavski as a simplified way for actors to think about characterization.

25|$|Russell and Moore {{were devoted}} to clarity in {{arguments}} by breaking down philosophical position into their simplest components.

In particular, he wanted to end what he saw as the excesses of metaphysics. Russell adopted William of Ockham's principle against multiplying unnecessary entities, Occam's Razor, as a central part of the method of analysis.|$|E

500|$|Joseph Bertin {{wrote in}} his 1735 {{textbook}} The Noble Game of Chess, [...] "He that plays first, is understood to have the attack." [...] This {{is consistent with the}} traditional view that White, by virtue of the first move, begins with the initiative and should try to extend it into the middlegame, while Black <b>should</b> <b>strive</b> <b>to</b> neutralize White's initiative and attain equality. Because White begins with the initiative, a minor mistake by White generally leads only to loss of the initiative, while a similar mistake by Black may have more serious consequences. Thus, Sveshnikov wrote in 1994, [...] "Black players cannot afford to make even the slightest mistake ... from a theoretical point of view, the tasks of White and Black in chess are different: White has to strive for a win, Black—for a draw!" ...|$|E

500|$|The game {{received}} [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews, {{according to}} video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Critics compared Rymdkapsel gameplay to Tetris and SimCity. Of its visual style, The New York Times published {{that the game}} makes others in the real-time strategy genre [...] "feel needlessly garnished". Reviewers generally appreciated the game's simplicity and challenge, but not its brevity and slow start. IGN's Steve Watts thought that the game made too many [...] "design concessions" [...] to its minimalism, though he considered the style [...] "gorgeous", and {{felt that he was}} never fully in control of his base. Eurogamer Tom Bramwell said that the game's minimalism extended to its core gameplay, where the player <b>should</b> <b>strive</b> <b>to</b> [...] "play the game less and less". Joseph Leray of TouchArcade described the game's balance and pacing as [...] "impeccable". He gave Rymdkapsel a perfect score and wrote that it felt as if it were custom-made for iOS. Bryan Vore of Game Informer criticized the game's lack of features and thought that it [...] "fizzled out with no fanfare" [...] as a [...] "creative" [...] idea but without sufficient [...] "polish". The Verges Trent Wolbe called the soundtrack [...] "a minimalist achievement". Jonasson announced that the game had sold 200,000 copies as of December 2, 2013, {{due in large part to}} its inclusion in a Humble Bundle sale.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} major {{decisions}} was how to localize character names. Hsu said that if character names sound too foreign {{and do not have}} any unconscious associations attached, rooted in the player's culture and language, they just come across as a [...] "jumble of sounds" [...] to the player, serving no purpose; she felt that the localized names, like the originals, <b>should</b> <b>strive</b> <b>to</b> convey certain images and feelings to the player. She said that this was particularly important in Ace Attorney, due to how integral each name is to its respective character. Hsu and the translators brainstormed ideas, and eliminated suggestions until they had a final name for each character. These names are puns or have meanings: Athena Cykes' first name is a continuation of the series tradition of naming protagonists after mythological creatures or gods. The reason for spelling [...] "Cykes" [...] with a C instead of using the more common spelling [...] "Sykes" [...] came from how [...] "Sykes" [...] was considered too similar to the previous character Ema Skye's name, and how the shape of the letter C connects to the crescent moon motifs in the mood matrix, her glove and her earring. Widget was localized to use male pronouns because of his Japanese name, , which uses the kanji character [...] from the name , and which is often used to create [...] "generic-sounding little boy’s name out of a noun". Widget's English name was chosen to sound little and cute, similarly to the Japanese version's use of [...] rather than the usual way of writing [...] "Monita" [...] with the katakana character [...]|$|E
500|$|What Aflaq saw in Islam was {{a revolutionary}} movement. In {{contrast}} to other nationalities, the Arab awakening and expansion {{was attributed to}} a religious message. Because of this, Aflaq believed that the Arab's spirituality was directly linked to Islam, therefore, one could never take Islam {{out of the equation}} of what is essentially, and essentially is not, Arab. Arab nationalism, just as Islam had been during the lifetime of Muhammad, was a spiritual revolutionary movement, [...] leading the Arabs towards a new renaissance: Arab nationalism was the second revolution to appear in the Arab world. All Arab religious communities should, according to Aflaq, respect and worship the spirituality of Islam, even if they did not worship Islam in a religious sense – Aflaq was a Christian who worshipped Islam. Aflaq did not believe it was necessary to worship Muhammad, but believed that all Arabs <b>should</b> <b>strive</b> <b>to</b> emulate Muhammad. In the words of Aflaq himself, Arabs [...] "belong to the nation that gave birth to a Muhammad; or rather, because this Arab individual {{is a member of the}} community which Muhammad put all his efforts into creating [...] Muhammad was all the Arabs; let us today make all the Arabs Muhammad." [...] The Muslim of Muhammad's days were, according to Aflaq, synonymous with Arabs – the Arabs were the only ones to preach the message of Islam during Muhammad's lifetime. In contrast to Jesus, who was a religious leader, but not a political leader, Muhammad was both – the first leader of Islam and of the Arab world. Therefore, secularisation could not take the same shape in the Arab world as it did in the West.|$|E
