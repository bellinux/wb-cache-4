The fleet of D models stayed largely intact until late 1978, when 37 not already upgraded Ds were retired. The remainder were retired between 1982 and 1983.|$|E
40|$|Reproducing <b>skin</b> colors pleasingly is {{essential}} for photographic color reproduction. Moving <b>skin</b> colors toward their preferred <b>skin</b> color center improves the <b>skin</b> color preference. Two main factors to successfully enhance <b>skin</b> colors are: a method to detect <b>skin</b> colors effectively and a method to morph <b>skin</b> colors toward a preferred <b>skin</b> color region properly. This paper starts with introducing a method to enhance <b>skin</b> colors using a static <b>skin</b> color detection model. It significantly improves the color preference for <b>skin</b> colors that are not far off from regular <b>skin</b> tones. To enhance a greater range of <b>skin</b> tones effectively, another method that automatically adapts the <b>skin</b> color detection model to the <b>skin</b> tone of each individual image is proposed. It not only enhances <b>skin</b> colors effectively, but also adjusts the overall image colors to produce more accurate white balance on the image...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: (Pre) {{cancerous}} <b>skin</b> lesions accumulate more protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) upon {{topical application}} of 5 -aminolevulinic acid (ALA) than the surrounding normal <b>skin.</b> This {{might be the}} result of a higher percutaneous penetration of ALA into (pre) cancerous <b>skin.</b> Study Design/Materials and Methods: ALA penetration through (1) healthy <b>skin</b> with intact stratum corneum, (2) healthy <b>skin</b> with reduced stratum corneum (i. e. tape stripped <b>skin)</b> and (3) diseased <b>skin</b> with dysplastic and thickened epidermis (chronically UVB-exposed <b>skin)</b> was determined in an in vitro model with hairless mouse <b>skin.</b> Results: More ALA had penetrated through chronically UVB-exposed <b>skin</b> than through normal non-exposed <b>skin</b> after 8 hours ALA application. The amount of ALA penetrated through chronically UVB-exposed <b>skin</b> was smaller than through tape stripped <b>skin.</b> Conclusions: The stratum corneum barrier function is less effective in chronically UVB-exposed <b>skin</b> than in normal non-exposed <b>skin,</b> but more effective than in tape stripped <b>skin.</b> A higher penetration rate of ALA into (pre) cancerous lesions may be (partly) responsible for the greater accumulation of PpIX in such lesions.

40|$|The memory colour {{reproduction}} {{is an important}} factor in judging image quality of photographic images of real life scenes. As the most important memory colour category, <b>skin</b> tone was extensively studied for preferred {{colour reproduction}} in this research. The methodology to study <b>skin</b> colour preference was then applied to study the colour preference of two other important colour categories: green foliage and blue sky. There are three essential parts for preferred <b>skin</b> colour enhancement: 1) building a <b>skin</b> colour model to detect <b>skin</b> colours or <b>skin</b> pixels; 2) finding a preferred <b>skin</b> colour region or a preferred <b>skin</b> colour centre; and 3) developing an algorithm to morph <b>skin</b> colours toward the preferred <b>skin</b> colour region. This study for <b>skin</b> colour enhancement started with the mathematical modelling of the <b>skin</b> colour region for <b>skin</b> colour detection. The modelling of <b>skin</b> colours was then applied to adjust <b>skin</b> colours of test images for psychophysical experiments that were to determine a preferred <b>skin</b> colour region. Finally, the <b>skin</b> colour modelling and the preferred <b>skin</b> colour centres were applied to adjust <b>skin</b> colours of digital photographic images for preferred colour reproduction. Two approaches were developed to model the <b>skin</b> colour distribution for <b>skin</b> colour detection. The first approach was to model a local colour region for general applications. A convex hull is constructed to fit the geometrical shape of a local region, and then the convex hull is approximated with mathematical formulae. The formulations and data fitting are adjusted with interactive 3 -D visualization. The approach is flexible for fitting data gamut with various mathematical forms for different purposes. The other approach was to model <b>skin</b> colours with elliptical shapes. Three elliptical <b>skin</b> colour models were developed for <b>skin</b> colour detection. The first one is to model the <b>skin</b> colour cluster using a single ellipse ignoring the lightness (or luminance) dependency. It is simple and efficient, and the <b>skin</b> colour detection accuracy may be adequate for many applications. In the second model, the <b>skin</b> colour ellipse is adapted to different lightness so that the shape of the ellipse fits the <b>skin</b> colour cluster more accurately. The model is more complex to train and is less efficient in computation, but it is more accurate in <b>skin</b> colour detection. In the third method, an ellipsoid is trained to fit the <b>skin</b> colour cluster. It is almost as simple to train as the first model, but the <b>skin</b> colour detection accuracy is improved. Finally, these models were applied to train mixed <b>skin</b> colours, African <b>skin</b> colours, Caucasian <b>skin</b> colours, and Asian <b>skin</b> colours.

25|$|The surgeon replaces missing {{parts with}} tissue of like quality and quantity; nasal lining with mucosa, {{cartilage}} with cartilage, bone with bone, and <b>skin</b> with <b>skin</b> that best match the native <b>skin</b> color and <b>skin</b> {{texture of the}} damaged nasal subunit. For such surgical repairs, <b>skin</b> flaps are preferable to <b>skin</b> grafts, because <b>skin</b> flaps generally are the superior remedy for matching the color and the texture of nasal <b>skin,</b> better resist tissue contracture, and provide better vascularisation of the nasal skeleton; thus, when there is sufficient <b>skin</b> to allow tissue harvesting, nasal <b>skin</b> is the best source of nasal <b>skin.</b> Furthermore, despite its notable scarring propensity, the nasal <b>skin</b> flap is the prime consideration for nasal reconstruction, because of its greater verisimilitude.|$|R
40|$|<b>Skin</b> {{has been}} paid {{attention}} as a site of application of prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs (non-prescription drugs) and cosmetics. <b>Skin</b> permeation and <b>skin</b> concentration of the compounds should be considered after topical administration, {{as well as their}} blood concentration to evaluate efficacy and safety. Since the evaluation of the amount of drugs permeated through <b>skin</b> is important for topically applied drugs, studies on the <b>skin</b> permeation has been greatly advanced. In addition, many reports proved that <b>skin</b> permeabilities of drugs could be predicted from physicochemical parameters of drugs. On the other hand, few reports have been found on the prediction of <b>skin</b> concentration of drugs. Furthermore, many experimented problems are left to determine the <b>skin</b> concentration of drugs: severe consume of human or animal <b>skins,</b> difficult removal of applied drugs from the <b>skin</b> surface, low drug extraction ratio from <b>skin</b> and low sensitivity to determine <b>skin</b> concentration of drugs, and requirement of long time measurement. Thus, fast and accurate measurement of <b>skin</b> concentration of applied drugs are urgently required. This report describes the relationship between <b>skin</b> permeation and <b>skin</b> concentration, and the prediction of <b>skin</b> concentration of drugs using <b>skin</b> permeation parameters of drugs. 本総説は、日本薬学会第 132 年会シンポジウムS 01 で発表したものを中心に記述したものである...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Autologous <b>skin</b> {{substitutes}} {{to cover}} large <b>skin</b> defects are used since several years. Melanocytes, although essential for solar protection and pigmentation of <b>skin,</b> {{are not yet}} systematically added to such substitutes. In this experimental study, we reconstructed melanocyte-containing dermo-epidermal <b>skin</b> substitutes from donor <b>skins</b> of different <b>skin</b> pigmentation types and studied them in an animal model. Features pertinent to <b>skin</b> color were analyzed and compared in both <b>skin</b> substitutes and original donor <b>skin.</b> METHODS: Keratinocytes, melanocytes, and fibroblast were isolated, cultured, and expanded from <b>skin</b> biopsies of light- and dark-pigmented patients. For each donor, melanocytes and keratinocytes were seeded in different ratios (1 : 1, 1 : 5, 1 : 10) onto collagen gels previously populated with autologous fibroblasts. <b>Skin</b> substitutes were then transplanted onto full-thickness wounds of immuno-incompetent rats. After 8  weeks, macroscopic and microscopic analyses were conducted with regard to <b>skin</b> color and architecture. RESULTS: Chromameter evaluation revealed that <b>skin</b> color of reconstructed light- and dark-pigmented <b>skin</b> was very similar to donor <b>skin,</b> independent of which melanocyte/keratinocyte ratio was added. Histological analyses of the <b>skin</b> analogs confirmed these findings. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that adding autologous melanocytes to bioengineered dermo-epidermal <b>skin</b> analogs can sustainably restore the patients' native <b>skin</b> color...|$|R
