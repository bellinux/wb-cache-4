30|$|So far, perfect CSI {{has been}} assumed and in practice, such {{assumption}} is not valid. Channel estimation errors are possibly caused by inaccurate channel estimation/equalization, noise or Doppler shift. Conventionally, channel estimation {{is based on}} transmitting a known pilot ‘training’ sequence with a particular power, prior to data transmission. Inaccurate channel estimation results in a channel estimation error with variance, denoted as ε. At {{the end of the}} training phase, the receiving node has imperfect CSI for channel equalization and data detection. In the following <b>subsections,</b> the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> channel estimation errors on the performance of the M 2 M-STNC and M 2 M-STNC-ONS schemes, assuming perfect timing synchronization, is studied and characterized.|$|R

Considering the presented heuristics used on the reputation system update module presented at the end of the Section 3, this section is divided into four <b>subsections.</b> The <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> the proposed reputation system in a single-copy routing protocol, called First Contact, is presented in the Subsection 5.1. The Subsection 5.2 focuses on the performance of the same reputation system when enforced in Spray and Wait routing protocol, while the Subsection 5.3 presents a discussion about the obtained results for GeoSpray routing protocol. Finally, the last subsection discusses the obtained results for this urban environment.|$|R
40|$|Program, more {{detailed}} information on transmission planning and projects, a new <b>subsection</b> on the <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> climate change on power system operations, and new case options that analyze higher levels of energy efficiency and solar distributed generation. The current load forecast used in this IRP {{is lower than the}} one used in 2011. Compared to the prior forecast, electricity sales for year 2020 decreased by approximately 5. 3 percent mostly due to increasing levels of energy efficiency. Early coal replacement continues to be a key strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As with last year’s IRP, this 2012 IRP recommends divestiture of the Navajo coal plant by 2015, four years ahead of the scheduled 2019 end date. LADWP will replace the loss of Navajo with energy efficiency, renewable energy, and natural gas generation. LADWP’s other coal source – the Intermountain Power Project—is undergoing discussions which could enable a future conversion to lower emitting resources. Because LADWP is one of thirty-six purchasers of IPP energy, any future plans must be agreed to by all project participants. Proposed amendments to the existing contracts are being considered by the purchasers which would require IPP to switch fuel from coal to natural gas no later than July 1, 2025 (two-years before the legal deadline) ...|$|R

Simulations in this <b>subsection</b> demonstrate this <b>impact</b> through extensive scenarios, wherein the area of the flat grid is varied from 100  ×  100   to 500  ×  500  m 2 and the distance d between the BS and the network field is varied from 100  m to 500  m. All simulations are run until the death of the last node, while the statistics are collected for each of the FND, HND and LND metrics, in order to compare the overall network lifetime achieved by the SHPER and SHEAR protocols.|$|R
