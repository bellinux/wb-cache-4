50|$|Most {{carnivorous}} plants selectively feed {{on specific}} prey. This selection {{is due to}} the available prey and the type of trap used by the organism. With the Venus flytrap, prey is limited to beetles, spiders and other crawling arthropods. In fact, the Dionaea diet is 33% ants, 30% spiders, 10% beetles, and 10% grasshoppers, with fewer than 5% flying insects. Given that Dionaea evolved from an ancestral form of Drosera (carnivorous plants that use a <b>sticky</b> <b>trap</b> instead of a snap trap) the reason for this evolutionary branching becomes clear. Whilst Drosera consume smaller, aerial insects, Dionaea consume larger terrestrial bugs. Dionaea are able to extract more nutrients from these larger bugs.

Further reliable information used is the sampling of olives to estimate the extent of infestation. In this case, the threshold for intervention of an active infestation is recommended between 10-15% on cultivars for oil production and 5% for table cultivars. Sampling is carried out weekly and taken randomly over a large area for an olive tree at head height. A sample is separated from samples of 100-200 olives, which are to detect the presence of live and uninfected eggs and larvae at first and second stages. The presence of eclosions, larvae and pupal third stages should not be counted because the damage has already occurred and the treatment would be worthless.|$|E

40|$|Collection methods {{currently}} used for large-scale sampling of adult Stegomyia mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) present several operational limitations, which constitute major drawbacks to the epidemiological surveillance of arboviruses, {{the evaluation of}} the impact of control strategies, and the surveillance of the spreading of allochthonous species into non-endemic regions. Here, we describe a new <b>sticky</b> <b>trap</b> designed to capture adult container-breeding mosquitoes and to monitor their population dynamics. We tested the sampling properties of the <b>sticky</b> <b>trap</b> in Rome, Italy, where Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus is common. The results of our observations, and the comparison between <b>sticky</b> <b>trap</b> catches and catches made with the standard oviposition trap, are presented. The <b>sticky</b> <b>trap</b> collected significantly larger numbers of Ae. albopictus females than any other Culicidae species representing > 90 % of the total catches. A maximum of 83 An. albopictus females was collected in a single week. A high correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0. 96) was found between the number of females and the number of eggs collected by the traps. The functional relationship between the number of eggs and the number of adult females was assessed by major axis regression fitted to log(1 + x) -transformed trap counts as y = 0. 065 + 1. 695 x. Trap samples significantly departed from a random distribution; Taylor's power law was fitted to the trap samples to quantify the degree of aggregation in the catches, returning the equations s(2) = 2. 401 m(1. 325) for the <b>sticky</b> <b>trap</b> and s(2) = 13. 068 m(1. 441) for the ovitrap, with s(2) and m denoting the weekly catch variance and mean, respectively, indicating that eggs were significantly more aggregated than mosquitoes (P < 0. 0001). Taylor's power law parameters were used to estimate the minimum number of sample units necessary to obtain sample estimates with a fixed degree of precision and sensitivity. For the range of densities encountered in our study area during the Ae. albopictus breeding season, the <b>sticky</b> <b>trap</b> was more precise and sensitive than the ovitrap. At low population densities (c. < 0. 1 mosquito/trap), however, the ovitrap was more sensitive at detecting the presence of this species. Overall, our results indicate that our new model of <b>sticky</b> <b>trap</b> can be used to sample Ae. albopictus females in urban environments, and, possibly, other container-breeding Stegomyia mosquitoes (e. g.

40|$|Abstract Background: In {{the last}} decades, Aedes albopictus {{has become an}} {{increasing}} public health threat in tropical {{as well as in}} more recently invaded temperate areas due to its capacity to transmit several human arboviruses, among which Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika. Enhancing the efficiency of currently used collection approaches, such as ovitraps and sticky traps, is desirable for optimal monitoring of the species abundance, for assessment of the risk of arbovirus transmission and for the optimisation of control activities. Findings: Two sets of 4 × 4 Latin-square experiments were carried out in Tirana (Albania) to test whether modifications in ovitrap shape and size and in oviposition substrate would increase collections of Ae. albopictus eggs and whether hay-infusion would increase adult catches by <b>sticky</b> <b>trap.</b> Generalized Linear Mixed Models with negative binomial error distribution were carried out to analyse the data. Cylindrical ovitraps lined with germination paper yielded significantly higher egg catches than those exploiting either the (commonly used) wooden paddles or floating polystyrene blocks as oviposition substrates. No difference was observed between cylindrical and conical shaped ovitraps. Ovitraps and sticky traps baited with hay infusion yielded significantly higher egg and adult catches than un-baited ones. A significant relationship between ovitrap and <b>sticky</b> <b>trap</b> catches was observed both in the absence and in the presence of attractants, with ovitrap catches increasing more than <b>sticky</b> <b>trap</b> catches at increasing adult female densities. Conclusions: This study provides grounds for optimisation of ovitraps and sticky traps as monitoring tools for Ae. albopictus by (i) supporting use of germination paper as most appropriate oviposition substrate; (ii) suggesting the possible use of stackable conical ovitraps for large scale monitoring; (iii) confirming the use of hay-infusion to increase egg catches in ovitraps, and showing that hay-infusion also significant increases adult catches by sticky traps...|$|E
