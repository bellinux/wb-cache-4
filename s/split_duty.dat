5000|$|Bell was undrafted out of college, but {{signed with}} the Denver Broncos for the 1986 season. Almost {{exclusively}} a kick returner (he had just 3 receptions and less than 100 yards rushing in four seasons with the team), Bell initially saw <b>split</b> <b>duty</b> with Gene Lang. However, after he finished his rookie year 6th in the league with 23.1 yards per return, he became the starter for all but three games where he was injured in 1987. Bell was so popular with the coaching staff, that even though his replacement Shane Swanson still holds the franchise rookie record for most all-purpose yards in a game, {{he was released from}} the team when Bell returned. In the 1987-88 NFL playoffs, Bell muffed a kick-off return late in the 4th quarter of the AFC Championship Game, recovering it at the 2-yard line. This set up [...] "The Drive", arguably the defining moment of Hall of Famer John Elway's career. Bell returned most of the Broncos kicks in both 1988 (career highs of 36 returns for 768 yards) and 1989 (30 returns for 602 yards). However, Bell had an unacceptable five fumbles that season (matching his previous career total), and was released by the team.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{hands-on}} concepts for the {{new medical}} robot KineMedic are presented and exemplied through a biopsy application. Hands-on provides, by simply touching and mov-ing the robot structure, a highly intuitive user interface for robot positioning. The KineMedic has an anthropomorphic structure with 7 DoF and is fully torque controlled. Due to the kinematic redundancy, the presented hands-on concept is particularly suitable since it allows {{not only for the}} TCP posi-tioning but also for the adjustment of the robot pose. Further-more, <b>split</b> <b>duty</b> is possible through the implemented control structure, i. e. motions commanded by the user through haptic interaction can be mapped into a space of user-controllable motions both in Cartesian and joint space, whereas the re-maining motion space is controlled by the robotic system. 1...|$|E
