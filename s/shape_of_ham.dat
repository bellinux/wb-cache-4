40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{was made}} on topic Technology of production and quality control <b>of</b> <b>ham.</b> The main problematics is classification <b>of</b> <b>ham</b> to the assortment of meat products, definition <b>of</b> <b>ham,</b> production technology and methods, which are used for quality control of this product. Besides <b>of</b> characterization <b>of</b> <b>ham,</b> the other types <b>of</b> <b>hams,</b> which are known in foreign countries, are described in this thesis too. Smoked and dry-cured ham included. In the Czech republic {{the most important and}} the most known ham is Prague Ham. In this time there is attempt for registration <b>of</b> Prague <b>Ham</b> as one <b>of</b> traditional speciality guaranteed. The base of production technology is selection of high-quality raw material and suitable proportion of individual components of brine. Right carrying out of production steps up to packing, are important steps which are ensuring producion of high-quality and harmless to health product. Quality control is done by sensory analysis, physico-chemical analysis and instrumental methods...|$|R

2500|$|The Asiatic race theory {{holds that}} the ancient Egyptians were the lineal {{descendants}} <b>of</b> the biblical <b>Ham,</b> through his son Mizraim. This theory was the most dominant view from the Early Middle Ages (c. 500 AD) {{all the way up}} to the early 19th century. The descendants <b>of</b> <b>Ham</b> were traditionally considered to be the darkest-skinned branch of humanity, either because of their geographic allotment to Africa or because of the Curse <b>of</b> <b>Ham.</b> Thus, Diop cites Gaston Maspero [...] "Moreover, the Bible states that Mesraim, son <b>of</b> <b>Ham.</b> brother <b>of</b> Chus (Kush) ... and of Canaan, came from Mesopotamia to settle with his children on the banks of the Nile." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{irradiation}} dose (0, 5 and 10 kGy) of vacuum-packaged Iberian dry-cured ham slices from pigs fed on concentrate (CON) or free-range reared (FRG) was studied {{in relation to}} TBA-RS, hexanal content and instrumental colour changes. TBA-RS values increased after irradiation in the two sets <b>of</b> <b>hams</b> and the increase was dose-dependent. FRG samples showed higher TBA-RS values than CON samples in all treatments, although differences {{in the rate of}} formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances were different in the two types <b>of</b> <b>hams,</b> being higher in CON samples than in FRG ones. Irradiation <b>of</b> dry-cured <b>ham</b> slices significantly increased hexanal contents in both sets <b>of</b> <b>hams.</b> Irradiation produced statistically significant increases in vacuum-packed dry-cured ham slices lightness (L*-value), yellowness (b*-value) and chroma (C*-value). Irradiation resulted in significantly lower hue angle (h°) values and higher a*-values in both sets <b>of</b> <b>hams</b> indicating a redder colour of irradiated samples than non-irradiated, and these changes were greater in FRG samples than in CON samples. Differences in composition characteristics of raw material could {{play an important role in}} the irradiation-induced changes on colour and lipid oxidation <b>of</b> vacuum-packaged dry-cured <b>ham</b> slices. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
