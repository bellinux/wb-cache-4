50|$|After {{homogenization}} of the cream, {{the mixture}} must undergo pasteurization. Pasteurization is a mild heat {{treatment of the}} cream, {{with the purpose of}} killing any harmful bacteria in the cream. The homogenized cream undergoes high temperature short time (HTST) pasteurization method. In this type of pasteurization the cream is heated to the high temperature of 85 °C for thirty minutes. This processing step allows for a <b>sterile</b> <b>medium</b> for when it is time to introduce the starter bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Batch {{culture is}} the most common {{laboratory}} growth method in which bacterial growth is studied, but it is only one of many. It is ideally spatially unstructured and temporally structured. The bacterial culture is incubated in a closed vessel with a single batch of medium. In some experimental regimes, some of the bacterial culture is periodically removed and added to fresh <b>sterile</b> <b>medium.</b> In the extreme case, this leads to the continual renewal of the nutrients. This is a chemostat, also known as continuous culture. It is ideally spatially unstructured and temporally unstructured, in a steady state defined by the rates of nutrient supply and bacterial growth. In comparison to batch culture, bacteria are maintained in exponential growth phase, and the growth rate of the bacteria is known. Related devices include turbidostats and auxostats.|$|E

40|$|Invasion {{rates of}} {{airborne}} organic substances into <b>sterile</b> mineral <b>medium</b> were compared by using flasks closed with cotton stoppers, silicone stoppers, and screw caps with Teflon gaskets. The resulting increases of {{dissolved organic carbon}} were 0. 5, 0. 2, and 0 mg/liter per week, respectively. The compounds supported the growth of lake water bacteria and a strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens. Growth rates were correlated to the permeability of the stoppers used. The measured input of organic carbon in the <b>sterile</b> mineral <b>medium</b> {{is considered to be}} a minimum value for the actual contribution of organic compounds by the air. Multiplication rates of the bacteria suggest that the organisms prevent the escape of volatile organic substances from the medium by rapid utilization. The steady nutrient supply through the air should be considered in growth experiments with bacteria at low concentrations of nutrients...|$|R
5000|$|This species' showy flowers led to {{its being}} used as a parent in a spate of {{hybridisation}} starting in 1886, and resulting in a multitude of descendants with larger flowers and a wider range of colours. Both S. rexii and its hybrids proved to need little pampering in the gardens of Europe and the United States, making them perennially popular. Their resistance to dry conditions makes them ideal subjects for hanging baskets in greenhouses. As in the sister genus of Saintpaulia, propagation is readily done from leaf cuttings that are best taken in spring and early summer. Any <b>sterile</b> <b>medium</b> may be used provided it is well drained. The tips of the leaves will discolour and break off along abscission lines if stressed by cold or prolonged drought, though overwatering will encourage fungal growth.|$|E
40|$|Influence {{of changes}} in {{microstructure}} caused due to welding on microbiologically influenced corrosion of a duplex stainless steel was studied by exposing the weldment and parent metal to chloride medium containing sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Identically prepared coupons (same area and surface finish) exposed to <b>sterile</b> <b>medium</b> were used as the control. Etching-type attack was observed {{in the presence of}} SRB, which was predominant in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of the weldment. The anodic polarization studies indicated an increase in current density for coupon exposed to SRB-containing medium as compared to that obtained for coupon exposed to <b>sterile</b> <b>medium.</b> The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations after anodic polarization revealed that the attack was preferentially in the ferrite phase of HAZ of the weldment, whereas it was restricted to the austenite phase of the parent metal...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{microbial}} corrosion behaviors of 10 CrNiCu steel influenced by Thiobcillus ferrooxidans (T. f) were studied by microbiological, electrochemical and surface analysis method. The open circuit potential (Eocp) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the 10 CrNiCu electrodes were measured in immersion electrode way {{with and without}} T. f solution {{at the time of}} the 0, 2 nd, 7 th, 14 th and 21 st days, respectively. Eocp of the electrode immersed in <b>sterile</b> <b>medium</b> shifted to negative potential with the immersion time while that for immersion in T. f solutions shifted negatively, then positively and finally negatively. EIS results were interpreted with different equivalent circuits of the electrode/biofilm/solution interface.

40|$|The {{effects of}} time of {{exposure}} on {{the progression of}} pulmonary lesions in rats inoculated with Mycoplasma pulmonis and the rat coronavirus, sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) were studied, using six groups of 18 SPF Wistar rats (n = 108). Rats were inoculated intranasally as follows: Group 1, <b>sterile</b> <b>medium</b> only; Group 2, <b>sterile</b> <b>medium</b> followed one week later by 150 TCID 50 SDAV; Group 3, <b>sterile</b> <b>medium</b> followed by 10 (5. 7) colony forming units of M. pulmonis; Group 4, SDAV followed one week later by M. pulmonis; Group 5, M. pulmonis followed one week later by SDAV; Group 6, M. pulmonis followed two weeks later by SDAV.

Bronchoalveolar lavage and quantitative lung mycoplasma cultures were conducted on two-thirds of the rats. Histopathological examination and scoring of lesion severity were performed on all animals. Based on the prevalence and extent of histopathological lesions, bronchoalveolar lavage cell numbers, neutrophil differential cell counts and the isolation of M. pulmonis, the most severe disease occurred in the groups that received both agents.

40|$|Abstract: Since {{the dental}} implant/abutment {{interface}} cannot totally seal {{the passage of}} microorganisms, the interior of implant becomes a reservoir of pathogenic microorganisms that produce and maintain chronic inflammation in the tissues around implants. Silver nanoparticles (nano-Ag) are potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the capacity of the nano-Ag to prevent the contamination of the implant internal surface byCandida albicans, caused by the implant/abutment microgap infiltration. Thirty-six implants were used in this experiment. Three study groups were performed: experimental group (implants receiving an application of nano-Ag in their inner cavity before installation of the abutment); positive-control group (implants receiving sterile phosphate buffer saline application instead of nano-Ag) and negative-control group (implants receiving the application of nano-Ag in the inner cavity and immersed in a <b>sterile</b> <b>medium).</b> In the positive-control and experimental groups, the implants were immersed in a Candida albicans suspension. The abutments of all three groups were screwed with a 10 N torque. After 72 h of immersion inC. albicans suspension or <b>sterile</b> <b>medium,</b> the abutments were removed and the inner surface of the implants was sampled with absorbent paper cone for fungal detection. No C. albicans contamination was observed in the negative-control group.
