From the fare control, {{there are two}} long escalators and a <b>stair</b> to an intermediate level, and then two shorter escalators and a pair of stairs to a lower mezzanine. Here, the bank splits and there are two separate tubes of two escalators and a <b>stair</b> each to each platform. The platform elevator has its own two turnstiles, and makes three stops (mezzanine, upper platform, lower platform).|$|E

5|$|The central {{range was}} begun around 1500, {{possibly}} as a two-storey building containing a great hall, although only fragments {{of this building}} remain. The south entrance to the tower house was blocked up, and replaced with a ground floor entrance from the east. A new <b>stair</b> tower, with a broad spiral <b>stair,</b> was built at the south-east corner. Originally topped by a conical roof, this <b>stair</b> gave access to the upper floors in the tower, and to the central range. Around 1570, the 4th Earl of Morton rebuilt the block, extending it further south to form new apartments. This block, forming the present three-storey central range, includes a vaulted kitchen and cellar in the basement, with suites of rooms above. The two bedrooms {{on the first floor}} each have their own closets and garderobes, or privies. The west apartment is accessed from the terraced garden, via another <b>stair</b> to the south-west, and has a private <b>stair</b> which led up to another chamber above, suggesting that these were the Earl and Countesses apartments. The upper storey, whose timber floor is now missing, comprised three more apartments, including one over the <b>stair.</b> The exterior of the block is decorated with a horizontal decorative strip of masonry known as a string course. One first-floor window is decorated with carved stone pilasters and strapwork, in a similar style to windows at Edinburgh Castle and Drochil Castle, in the Borders, both of which were built under Morton's Regency.|$|E

5|$|Leading {{figures in}} the new Parliament {{included}} Lord Melville, a Rye House Plotter who joined William's court in 1683 and the Earl of <b>Stair,</b> {{a former member of}} James VII's administration. In 1689 Melville became Secretary of State over Scotland, with <b>Stair</b> appointed Lord Advocate. The first session ended in a stalemate between Crown and Parliament over the abolition of Episcopacy and the Committee of the Articles, an unelected body used by the Scottish Crown to control legislation. Parliament refused to approve taxes or accept nominations for legal officers, closing the law courts. William retaliated by withholding Royal Assent which prevented the implementation of Parliamentary legislation.|$|E

John <b>Stairs</b> became {{involved}} in the shipping business but after some financial difficulties the family returned to Philadelphia in 1793. There, both John <b>Stairs</b> and his wife died and their five children, including the eight-year-old William Machin <b>Stairs,</b> returned to Halifax to be raised by a maternal uncle.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{necessity}} {{and ability to}} climb <b>stairs</b> in persons after a lower-limb amputation (LLA) and the relation of this ability with personal and clinical variables. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Outpatient department of a rehabilitation center. Participants: Persons with an LLA (N= 155; mean age +/- SD, 64. 1 +/- 11. 2 y; 73 % men). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: The necessity to climb <b>stairs</b> was assessed with the Prosthetic Profile of the Amputee. Several indicators {{of the ability to}} climb <b>stairs</b> were assessed including: (1) independence in climbing <b>stairs</b> with a handrail and (2) without a handrail, according to the Locomotor Capabilities Index; (3) numbers of floors actually climbed, according to a rating scale; and (4) limitations in climbing <b>stairs,</b> according to the Climbing <b>Stairs</b> Questionnaire (range, 0 - 100, with higher scores indicating less limitations). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the associations between the ability to climb <b>stairs</b> and personal and clinical variables. Results: Of the participants, 47 % had to climb <b>stairs.</b> The ability to climb <b>stairs</b> was: (1) 62 % independently climbed <b>stairs</b> with a handrail and (2) 21 % without a handrail; (3) 32 % didn't climb any <b>stairs,</b> 34 % climbed half a floor or 1 floor, and 34 % climbed >= 2 floors; (4) the median sum score (interquartile range) of the Climbing <b>Stairs</b> Questionnaire was 38 (19 - 63), indicating marked limitations. Older participants and women were less able to climb <b>stairs</b> with and without a handrail. Conclusions: A considerable number of persons with an LLA have to climb <b>stairs</b> in their home environment. Many of them, especially older participants and women, are particularly hampered in their ability to climb <b>stairs.</b> Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation 2013; 94 : 1573 - 9 (C) 2013 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicin...|$|R

5|$|The {{monument}} {{is filled}} with ironwork, consisting of its stairs, elevator columns and associated tie beams, none of which supports {{the weight of the}} stonework. It was redesigned in 1958 to reduce congestion and improve the flow of visitors. Originally, visitors entered and exited {{the west side of the}} elevator on the observation floor, causing congestion. So the large landing at the 490-foot level was expanded to a full floor and the original spiral <b>stair</b> in the northeast corner between the 490- and 500-foot levels was replaced by two spiral stairs in the northeast and southeast corners. Now visitors exit the elevator on the observation floor, then walk down either spiral <b>stair</b> before reboarding the elevator for their trip back down.|$|E

5|$|The west front has {{two large}} {{flanking}} three-stage towers. On the rear outer {{corners of the}} towers are octagonal <b>stair</b> turrets with panels on the belfry stage.

5|$|A second range stood {{along the}} north-west wall, {{and would have}} been {{connected}} to the hall range by the donjon tower. The ground floor housed a kitchen. In 1725 the range was remodelled into a two-storey house, accessed via a stone <b>stair,</b> and topped with the dormer windows which now form part of the gatehouse. The well in front is original, although the large stone surround is of 19th century date.|$|E
5|$|All five {{floors are}} {{connected}} by a central scale-and-platt staircase, added in the early 17th century to replace a turnpike <b>stair</b> in the south-west. The rooms of the upper floors have impressive panelling and decorated ceilings. The main hall, in the south part of the block, has been divided, but retains a large fireplace with the carved initials WS and JE, for William Sinclair and his wife Jean Edmonstone, and the date 1597.|$|E
50|$|After the Soviet revolution, in 1955, the Primorsky <b>Stairs</b> were renamed as Potemkin <b>Stairs</b> {{to honor}} the 50th anniversary of the mutiny on the Battleship Potemkin.

5|$|In about 1797 a {{schoolmaster}} {{living in}} the village cultivated the Williams pear. The schoolmaster (either Mr Wheeler or his successor, John <b>Stair)</b> was the original cultivator, but the pear (a cultivar of the European Pear) was named after Richard Williams of Turnham Green, who grew several grafts of the original tree. On 5 December 1956, a plaque commemorating the tree was unveiled {{on the wall of}} the village school.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 15th century, the Zytglogge {{and the other}} Bernese gate towers were {{extended}} and decorated after the Burgundian Romantic fashion. The Zytglogge received a new lantern (including the metal bellman visible today), four decorative corner towerlets, heraldic decorations and probably its <b>stair</b> tower. The astronomical clock was extended to its current state. In 1527–30, the clockwork was completely rebuilt by Kaspar Brunner, and the gateway was overarched to provide a secure foundation for the heavy machinery.|$|E
5|$|Internally, {{a number}} of rooms feature period wall and ceiling decorations {{including}} the entrance hall, which dates from the original 1730s building and features moulded panelling and cornices, a marble fireplace and ornamental plaster ceiling and an arabesque frieze.
