5000|$|The duo's {{music has}} been {{described}} as being found at [...] "that sweet spot at the intersection of country, rock and blues". Regarded as a [...] "countrified Civil Wars/Black Keys mix", <b>Striking</b> <b>Matches</b> employ tight vocal harmonies in their guitar-driven music.|$|R
50|$|One {{specific}} {{variety of}} go-to-bed worthy of mention is 'Prince Albert's Safety Vesta Box'. This was a decorated brass tub with an embossed top. Ribbed under base for <b>striking</b> <b>matches,</b> {{it had a}} small finial to take a single match on top, and was marked 'Prince Albert's Safety Box, 150 Patent Vesta Lights'.|$|R

50|$|In {{the opening}} round of the Bellator Season Five Middleweight Tournament, Shlemenko fought Zelg Galesic, a Croatian mixed martial artist with a Tae Kwon Do background. This fight was {{anticipated}} as an interesting <b>striking</b> <b>match</b> between two experienced stand-up fighters. Despite these expectations, Alexander won via standing guillotine choke in the first round, proving his rarely seen submission skills.|$|R

50|$|The Crown has ten booths, or snugs. Built to {{accommodate}} the pub's more reserved customers during the austere Victorian period, the snugs feature the original gun metal plates for <b>striking</b> <b>matches</b> and an antique bell system for alerting staff. Extra privacy was then afforded by the pub's etched and stained glass windows which feature painted shells, fairies, pineapples, fleurs-de-lis and clowns.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, I'll ask you," [...] protested Teddy, who was futilely <b>striking</b> <b>match</b> after {{match on}} the dashboard, [...] "not to call those denizens {{of the air}} plugs. They can kick out a hundred miles between {{daylight}} and dark." [...] At last he succeeded in snatching a light for his cigar from the flame held {{in the hollow of}} his hands.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, {{the site of}} King Library was held by Hepburn Hall, a {{residence}} building for women. The shortage of housing forced some women {{to live in the}} attic about the third floor. Because some of the lights were defective, some residents had to <b>strike</b> <b>matches</b> to find their way and it was rumored that some women used the attic as a smoking lounge. Due to these circumstances, a major fire burned down Hepburn Hall on January 14, 1908.|$|R

2500|$|The first <b>striking</b> <b>match</b> with a {{phosphorus}} {{head was}} invented by Charles Sauria in 1830. These matches (and subsequent modifications) were made with heads of white phosphorus, an oxygen-releasing compound (potassium chlorate, lead dioxide, or sometimes nitrate), and a binder. They were poisonous to the workers in manufacture, sensitive to storage conditions, toxic if ingested, and hazardous when accidentally ignited on a rough surface. [...] Production in several countries was banned between 1872 and 1925. The international Berne Convention, ratified in 1906, prohibited the use of white phosphorus in matches.|$|R
50|$|The snark's flavour is meager and hollow, but crisp (apparently like a coat {{too tight}} in the waist), with a flavour of will-o-the-wisp. It is {{sometimes}} served with greens. It also sleeps {{late into the}} day. While the snark is very ambitious, and has very little sense of humor, it is very fond of bathing-machines, and constantly carries them about wherever it goes. It is also handy for striking a light; the Annotated Snark suggests that this could mean either that its skin is useful for <b>striking</b> <b>matches</b> on, or that it breathes fire.|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} house price {{distributions}} for the English cities of London, Manchester, Bristol, Newcastle, Birmingham and Leeds. We find Pareto (power law) behaviour in their upper tails, which is clearly distinct from lognormal and gamma distributions {{in the cases}} of London, Manchester and Newcastle. For London, the city with the lowest power, this is a <b>striking</b> <b>match</b> with that found in the wealth distribution of the super-rich. We propose an index of Housing Wealth Inequality based on the Pareto exponent and analogous to the Gini coefficient, and comment on its possible uses. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figures, 2 table...|$|R

5000|$|The main theme, {{reminiscent}} of a music box, is scored for harpsichord, accompanied by a chamber ensemble of string instruments and woodwinds. The love theme, apparently based on the song [...] "Tit-willow" [...] from the Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera The Mikado, is likewise played by woodwinds and a muted harpsichord. Liška's score also includes various shorter cues, such as a short pathos-filled theme for {{the sinking of the}} ship Amelie, keyboard <b>strikes</b> <b>matching</b> the attacks on the giant octopus, and a serene finale for string orchestra. The film's score remains one of Liška's most notable works.|$|R
