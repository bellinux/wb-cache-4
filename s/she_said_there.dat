5|$|Although Kratos killed Poseidon, he was {{abandoned}} by Gaia when his {{first encounter with}} Zeus went poorly. Stranded in the Underworld and now betrayed by both the Olympians and Titans, Kratos learned from the spirit of Athena, who also provided the Blades of Exile, {{that he needed to}} find the Flame of Olympus, which is the key to defeating Zeus. Kratos murdered both Titans and gods, ignoring the warnings of his victims as he sought the Flame. Realizing the key to pacifying the Flame and reaching Pandora's Box (engulfed by the Flame) is Pandora herself, Kratos came to care for Pandora, who reminded him of his lost daughter Calliope. Kratos showed humanity when he attempted to stop Pandora from sacrificing herself to quench the Flame, but reluctantly allowed the act when <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was no other option. Finding the box empty, and driven berserk by Zeus' mockery, Kratos attacked his father. Although Gaia interrupted and tried to kill Kratos and Zeus, she was destroyed by Kratos, who then apparently defeated Zeus. Zeus returned in spirit form and attacked Kratos, who retreated into his psyche. Kratos forgave himself for his past sins with the help of Lysandra. Pandora later appeared and told Kratos that hope would save him. Kratos was revived and easily destroyed Zeus. Athena confronted Kratos and demanded that he return the power of hope; the contents of Pandora's Box. In a selfless act, Kratos refused, stated his need for vengeance was gone and impaled himself with the Blade of Olympus, which dispersed the power across the world for mankind's use. Athena, disappointed with Kratos, removed the Blade and departed as Kratos collapsed next to the Blade of Olympus. The post-credits scene showed a trail of blood leading away from the Blade with Kratos' whereabouts unknown.|$|E
25|$|According to the woman, {{another car}} pulled over {{and tried to}} help Bermúdez Zacarías by telling a nearby {{security}} officer to call the police. The eyewitness then made a U-turn and followed the alleged assassins in her car. Tho two men went into hiding in an abandoned lot a few blocks away. She noticed that the lot was gated, {{and returned to the}} crime scene to see if any police officers had arrived. When the first policemen arrived, she reportedly told them that she saw two men walk into an abandoned lot. A third policemen went to inspect the lot, but came back to the murder scene after not seeing anything suspicious. The eyewitness complained to the press that the policemen were slow to act and may not have checked the abandoned lot thoroughly since <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> were several large bushes where the two men may have been hiding. A few days after her confession, the eyewitness stated that she was harassed by people who were presumably armed outside her home and in a vehicle.|$|E
500|$|The VA {{temporarily}} {{appointed a}} new {{manager for the}} southwest region of the United States. The southwest region includes the Phoenix VA facility. The new manager was previously involved in clandestinely placing a camera inside the hospital room of a patient in Florida. She later said that {{the manner of the}} camera's placement was [...] "wrong". The Republic reported that [...] "(she) at first said she authorized the videotaping because nurses were upset and wanted to prove family members were committing medical sabotage. Moments later, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was no intention to keep the filming secret from the Carnegies, and the camera was really approved for patient safety." [...] She said that she has previously been assigned to problematic hospitals during her career, including those with ethics violations or financial problems, and has been successful at fixing the problems.|$|E

500|$|During the October 2011, provincial election, Dunderdale said [...] "We've got {{too many}} people chasing too few fish, and these plants are going to {{collapse}} and fail because they're not on sound economic models". <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was overcapacity in the fishing industry and that fish processing plants would need to close. Minister Jackman, who represents a district that relies heavily on the fishing industry, continued to face much criticism for his performance in the fisheries portfolio and was re-elected by just 40 votes. The day after winning a majority government, Dunderdale stated {{in an interview that}} tough decisions were looming in the industry. She again stated there was overcapacity and structural problems in the fishery and that her government was ready to make the tough decisions that were long overdue. Dunderdale swore in her new cabinet weeks after the election and shuffled Jackman to the Department to Education, Darin King succeeded him as the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture.|$|E
500|$|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is {{the fourth}} book in the Harry Potter series. The first, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was {{published}} by Bloomsbury on 26 June 1997; the second, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was published on 2 July 1998; and the third, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, followed on 8 July 1999. Goblet of Fire is considerably longer than the first three; almost twice the size (the paperback edition was 636 pages). Rowling stated that she [...] "knew from the beginning {{it would be the}} biggest of the first four". <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> needed to be a [...] "proper run-up" [...] for the conclusion and rushing the [...] "complex plot" [...] could confuse readers. She also stated that [...] "everything is on a bigger scale" [...] which was symbolic, as Harry's horizons widened both literally and metaphorically as he grew up. She also wanted to explore more of the magical world.|$|E
500|$|Scenes {{from the}} film {{are said to be}} {{inspired}} by the director's childhood experiences as the daughter of Francis Ford Coppola. She recalls sampling all the gelato flavors on a Milanese hotel's room service menu, a trip to Italy, a helicopter ride, and though <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was a [...] "personal connection" [...] to the film, she denied it was an autobiography. Rather, she based the character of Cleo on a friend's daughter whose parents work in Hollywood and used her own experiences to relate to the character and add a realistic touch. Federico Fellini's Toby Dammit (1968) has also been noted as an influence. Meanwhile, the parental focus of the film developed because Coppola had recently had her second child. Coppola said that she thought of Dorff to play Marco early while writing the film, because he had an aura of [...] "the bad-boy actor," [...] but also [...] "this really sweet, sincere side." ...|$|E

500|$|Denning {{gave the}} leading {{judgment}} in D & C Builders Ltd v Rees [...] 2 QB 617 in 1965. D & C Builders Ltd (the respondent) {{had been hired}} by Rees (the appellant) to do some construction work at his shop, where he sold building materials. EWCA Civ 3 (12 November 1965) |publisher=BAILII|accessdate=6 May 2009}} The respondent finished the work and repeatedly phoned the appellant to request the money they were owed. After three phone calls spread out over several months the appellant's wife spoke to the respondents; <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> were several problems with the work that they had done, and she would only pay £300 of the £482 owed. The respondents replied that £300 would barely {{cover the costs of}} the materials, but that they would accept it anyway. If the respondents had not received the money they would have gone bankrupt, something the appellant's wife was well aware of. In his judgment, Denning modified English case law on part payment and accord and satisfaction, saying that the rules on part payment can be set aside in situations where one of the parties is under duress. The fact that D & C Builders were effectively forced into accepting the lesser amount meant that the payment was not valid.|$|E
500|$|Lady Hale {{was also}} {{concerned}} about the ramifications of the decision. [...] She asked if a doctor treating a patient after an accident and giving evidence about what happened as well as his opinions as to what would happen would be covered or not, or whether only in part. She noted that the ruling in the case would have to apply to experts dealing with cases before tribunals as well as courts, thus including claims for unfair dismissal before employment tribunals and disputes between landlord and tenants about service charges and rent assessments. [...] She queried whether it ought to extend to psychiatrists assessing patients for tribunal proceedings under the Mental Health Act 1983, or educational psychologists giving evidence about children with special educational needs in tribunal proceedings about their future education. In her view, these are [...] "sensitive and often highly fraught cases in which performing the expert's duty to the tribunal may well be perceived by the client patient or parent as a breach of her duty towards him." [...] In family law cases, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>there</b> would now be some professional witnesses who had immunity from negligence claims for their evidence and others who did not, with some of the distinctions between the two groups appearing to be [...] "arbitrary". She thought that the decision might make experts more likely to confirm their previous views rather than change them, and could lead to higher insurance premiums for experts, increased fees and the use of exemption clauses in contracts – [...] "in which case we shall be back where we started", she said. Overall, she called the decision to change the law [...] "irresponsible" [...] and, like Lord Hope, considered that the topic was best left to Parliament and the Law Commission.|$|E
500|$|In February 1999, Hill {{received}} four awards at the 30th Annual NAACP Image Awards. In May 1999, {{she became}} the youngest woman ever named to Ebony magazine's 100+ Most Influential Black Americans list; in November of that year, the same publication named her as one of [...] "10 For Tomorrow" [...] in the [...] "Ebony 2000: Special Millennium Issue". In May 1999, she made People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People list. The publication, which has called her [...] "model-gorgeous", praised the [...] Hill for her idiosyncratic sense of personal style. In June 1999, she received an Essence Award, but her acceptance speech, where <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was no contradiction in religious love and servitude and [...] " [...] who you are, as fly and as hot and as whatever," [...] drew reaction {{from those in the}} public who thought she was not a good role model as a young, unwed mother of two. This was a repetition of criticism she had received after the birth of her first child, and she had said that she and Marley would soon be married. In early 2000, Hill was one of many artists and producers to share the Grammy Award for Album of the Year for Santana's 1999 multi-million selling Supernatural, which she had written, produced, and rapped on the track [...] "Do You Like the Way" [...] for (a rumination on the direction the world was headed, it also featured the singing of CeeLo Green and the signature guitar runs of Carlos Santana).

Also, her concocted duet with Bob Marley on [...] "Turn Your Lights Down Low" [...] for the 1999 remix tribute album Chant Down Babylon additionally appeared in the 1999 film The Best Man and later received a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2011, Wollaston warned David Cameron {{that the}} Government's NHS reforms {{would result in}} the NHS going [...] "belly up".

However, her opposition to the NHS reforms calmed after the party leadership changed certain clauses at her suggestions and she eventually voted in favour of passage of the Health and Social Care Bill.|$|E
2500|$|Phillips has {{commented on}} the politicisation of education, {{particularly}} at Aberystwyth University. In 2005, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was an [...] "anti-Jewish witch-hunt {{going on in our}} seats of learning" [...] with particular focus on Aberystwyth University, based on an anonymous student's testimony. In 2008, following further allegations (supported by documentary evidence) made by another anonymous student regarding the biased nature and reading list of a course on terrorism convened by politics lecturer Dr Marie Breen Smyth, as well as allegations by the same student regarding bias against Israel by Breen Smyth and her colleague Dr Richard Jackson, Phillips wrote to the Vice Chancellor of the University saying that Breen Smyth was a [...] "subversive" [...] who {{should not be allowed to}} teach.

2500|$|With the {{unprecedented}} media interest raising {{the stakes in}} the contest, Ip's supporters have been waging a campaign of increasing bitterness. While Ip officially adopted [...] "I'll do better than my best" [...] as a campaign slogan, Chan uses [...] "vote with your conscience" [...] on her election posters. Ip's supporters, however, have put up banners attacking Chan personally. After their surprise victories in the District Council elections the week before, [...] "Ip's supporters ... have escalated their dogging of Chan {{to the point of}} harassment, if not outright intimidation" [...] according to political commentator, Michael DeGolyer. This type of direct face-to-face violence has never been seen in Hong Kong politics: a Civic Party member was sent to hospital after he was injured when an Ip supporter, a failed DAB District Council candidate, tried to snatch his mobile phone, while he took pictures of their activities. [...] "The violence has been worse than in previous elections," [...] Audrey Eu said. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> had been allegations of candidates, supporters and campaign posters having been targeted; the printer of election materials had his shop damaged and a supporter's taxi had its windows smashed." ...|$|E
2500|$|For 11 months, Abagnale {{impersonated}} a chief resident pediatrician in a Georgia hospital {{under the}} alias Frank Williams. He chose this course {{after he was}} nearly arrested disembarking a flight in New Orleans. Afraid of possible capture, he retired temporarily to Georgia. When filling out a rental application he impulsively listed his occupation as [...] "doctor", fearing that the owner might check with Pan Am if he wrote [...] "pilot". After befriending a real doctor {{who lived in the}} same apartment complex, he agreed to act as a supervisor of resident interns as a favor until the local hospital could find someone else to take the job. The position was not difficult for Abagnale because supervisors did no real medical work. However, he was nearly exposed when an infant almost died from oxygen deprivation because {{he had no idea what}} a nurse meant when <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was a [...] "blue baby." [...] He was able to fake his way through most of his duties by letting the interns handle the cases coming in during his late-night shift, setting broken bones and other mundane tasks. He left the hospital only after he realized he could put lives at risk by his inability to respond to life-and-death situations.|$|E
2500|$|Justice O'Connor {{joined the}} Court's decision. She {{accepted}} {{the contention that}} there was neither a [...] "right to commit suicide" [...] nor a [...] "right to die," [...] as such. She did not, however, think that the Court needed to consider the conflict beyond rejecting the facial challenges to the statute. Justice O'Connor stated that, {{in the context of}} the questions presented in this case, the Court did not need to address whether a patient had a constitutionally cognizable interest in controlling the circumstances of his or her imminent death." [...] The statute, she claimed, was constitutional on its face, because the state had interests - such as protecting those who are not truly competent or facing imminent death or whose decisions would not be genuinely voluntary - of such gravity as to validate its legislation in pursuit of these interests. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was no constitutional conflict here; a patient was free to seek pain-relieving medication from their doctor, even at risk of health, to alleviate suffering, and this was a constitutionally acceptable alternative to permit in the absence of legalized assisted suicide. Justice O'Connor went on to say that, because everyone will face suffering of this kind (be it to themselves or a loved one), she had faith in the democratic process to strike an appropriate balance. In short, the law was up to the people of New York to decide.|$|E
