5|$|A {{study in}} 2010 {{concluded}} that {{the main source of}} the mercury is likely worldwide industry, rather than local sources. As water levels rise and fall, mercury accumulation does as well. About 16 percent of the mercury comes in from rivers, and 84 percent comes from the atmosphere in a non-toxic, inorganic form. The non-toxic mercury is converted into toxic methyl mercury by bacteria which thrive in the more <b>saline</b> <b>water</b> of the North arm affected by the causeway.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are {{omnivorous}} and forage in {{wetlands and}} saltwater marshes. They tear up {{the ground with}} their powerful beaks in search of bulbs and edible roots. Northern populations mainly eat tubers of the bulkuru sedge (Eleocharis dulcis) which they extract by digging holes in the mud, {{but these are not}} available south of Brisbane. They also eat the shoots and leaves of wetland and upland plants, cereal grains, seeds, insects, mollusks, crustaceans, frogs and lizards. In saltwater marshes they may drink <b>saline</b> <b>water</b> and they have glands near their eyes through which they can excrete excess salt.|$|E
5|$|About 92% of Bahrain is desert with {{periodic}} droughts {{and dust}} storms, the main natural hazards for Bahrainis. Environmental issues facing Bahrain include desertification {{resulting from the}} degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal land reclamation at places such as Tubli Bay. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam Aquifer, the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its salinisation by adjacent brackish and <b>saline</b> <b>water</b> bodies. A hydrochemical study identified {{the locations of the}} sources of aquifer salinisation and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of Bahrain, where the aquifer receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of the aquifer are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; intrusion of sabkha water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.|$|E

5|$|Caddisfly larvae are aquatic, {{with six}} pairs of {{tracheal}} gills {{on the underside}} of the abdomen. The eggs are laid above water on emergent twigs or vegetation or on the water surface although females of some species enter water to choose sites. Although most species lay eggs, a few in the genus Triplectides are ovoviviparous. Some species lay eggs on land and although most are associated with freshwater, a few like Symphitoneuria are found in coastal <b>saline</b> <b>water.</b> Philanisus plebeius females lay their eggs into the coelomic cavity of intertidal starfish. The larvae are long and roughly cylindrical, very similar to those of lepidoptera but lacking prolegs. In case-bearing species, the heads are heavily sclerotinised while the abdomen is soft; the antennae are short and the mouthparts adapted for biting. Each of the usually ten abdominal segments bears a pair of legs with a single tarsal joint. In case-bearing species, the first segment bears three papillae, one above and two at the sides, which anchor the larva centrally in the tube. The posterior segment bears a pair of hooks for grappling. There are five to seven larval instars, followed by an aquatic pupa which has functional mandibles (to cut through the case), gills, and swimming legs.|$|E
25|$|Salinity {{occurs on}} {{drylands}} from overirrigation and {{in areas with}} shallow <b>saline</b> <b>water</b> tables.

The best-known case of shallow <b>saline</b> <b>water</b> table capillary action occurred in Egypt after the 1970 construction of the Aswan Dam. The change in the groundwater level led to high salt concentrations in the water table. The continuous high level of the water table led to soil salination.|$|E

The effects of <b>saline</b> irrigation <b>water</b> and cobalt on the vegetative growth characters [plant height (cm), leaf number (plant- 1), branch number (plant- 1), capsule number (plant 1), herb dry weight (plant- 1) and seed yield (plant- 1) ] and content of fixed oil, soluble sugars, proline, N,P,K and protein of black seed (Nigella sativa L.) plants were investigated.

40|$|AbstractIt {{has long}} been known that chloride-dominated <b>saline</b> ground <b>waters</b> occur at depth in the UK, not only beneath the sea but also onshore at depths of a few hundred metres. In a few places in {{northern}} England, these <b>saline</b> <b>waters</b> discharge naturally at surface in the form of springs. In recent years, however, these <b>saline</b> ground <b>waters</b> have come to be regarded as resources: as potential geothermal fluids intercepted in deep boreholes. Comparisons of the major ions and stable isotopes (δ 2 H, δ 18 O and δ 34 S) of these <b>saline</b> ground <b>waters</b> with North Sea oilfield formation waters, and with brines encountered in former subsea workings of coastal collieries, reveal that they are quite distinct from those found in North Sea oilfields, in that their as δ 2 H/δ 18 O signatures are distinctly “meteoric”. δ 34 S data preclude a significant input from evaporite dissolution – another contrast with many North Sea brines and some colliery waters. Yet, enigmatically, their total dissolved solids contents are far higher than typical meteoric waters. It is tentatively suggested that these paradoxical hydrogeochemical properties might be explained by recharge during Cenozoic uplift episodes, with high concentrations of solutes being derived by a combination of high-temperature rock–water interaction in the radiothermal granites and/or ‘freeze out’ from overlying permafrost that surely formed in this region during cold periods. Geothermometric calculations suggest these <b>saline</b> <b>waters</b> may well be representative of potentially valuable geothermal reservoirs...|$|R
