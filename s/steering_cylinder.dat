5000|$|The {{steering}} rack is almost conventional. As {{with a normal}} power-assisted steering setup, there is a rack-and-pinion, and a stepped hydraulic ram with a dividing plate (the piston) in the middle. On {{one side of the}} plate, the piston area is half the area of the other, giving twice the area for the fluid to work on. Thus, with full system pressure on the small area side of the ram, and half system pressure on the large area side, the ram remains perfectly balanced and centred. This is because the lower pressure is working on a larger surface area. The smaller side of the piston is at constant hydraulic pressure, the other side only varies in pressure. NOTE: The author seems to be describing the DS power steering piston and rod, on which the piston {{is in the middle of}} the rod. The SM's <b>steering</b> <b>cylinder</b> has the piston on the end of the rod, which rod's cross-sectional area is half the area of the other side of the piston. Full hydraulic pressure is admitted to the rod side at all times while the pressure on the other side of the piston (its [...] "head") is regulated.|$|E

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The researches in this thesis focus on the development of computer controlled electrohydraulic steering control system for off-road vehicle automatic guidance. The system developed in this research includes steering control computer, data acquisition pad, PWM driver, electrohydraulic proportional valve, hydraulic <b>steering</b> <b>cylinder</b> and vehicle steer angle sensor. Electrohydraulic proportional valve in the system has inherent dead-band and saturation. Dead-band influences steering accuracy very much. To remove it, a nonlinear compensation algorithm is developed and implemented in this research. The developed electrohydraulic steering control system is installed on a John Deere 8200 tractor. It receives steering command signal from a machine vision system. It also can receive steering command signal (sine wave, triangle wave and step signal) generated by computer. The test road conditions include paved cement road and farm field. The test results indicated that the developed electrohydraulic steering control system can implement steering control command successfully...|$|E
40|$|In {{hydraulic}} power steering systems of motor vehicles, often unintended acoustic phenomena can result from certain driving situations. The acoustic phenomenon known as “rattling” is generated by impacts on the <b>steering</b> <b>cylinder,</b> if the car rides over bumps, kerb stones or similar obstacles. In special friction conditions between tyre and road surface during parking, a phenomenon called “shuddering” occurs and leads to strong vibrations. These are audible by the driver as noise, and sensory through shaky steering wheel torque. In this PhD thesis the reasons for rattling and shuddering are analysed. The design of two test benches afford {{easy access to the}} steering systems´ components and allow measurement equipment to be easily installed. Furthermore, the development of simulation models are used to study different hydraulic line designs of the steering system. With the simulation models, physical data can be calculated, which can not be measured at the test benches. A comparison between measured and simulated data then verifies the simulation models. To evaluate measured and simulated data of different hydraulic line designs, characteristic numbers are calculated and compared. Active components, to eliminate both phenomena, are worked out systematically and structured in a matrix of principle solutions. The choice of an intelligent switch element out of the matrix leads to the design of three prototype valves, which are installed in the hydraulic lines of the power steering system and analysed at the two test benches. Characteristic numbers of the three valve lines are calculated and compared to the hydraulic line of the series. With the designed valve lines the rattling and shuddering problem can be solved...|$|E

Dynamical modling of wheeled articulated vehicle is built by using the multi-body dynamical simulation software RecurDyn and the curves of resistance moments are measured. After changing position of hinged point and axle base of wheel F, G(B, C),result of measurement is fitted and compared. It is shown that the ideal position of hinged point for steering is s 2 where resistance moment is minimum, which provides references for <b>steering</b> <b>cylinder’s</b> selection and design of whole vehicle...|$|R

40|$|This thesis compiles {{information}} {{of a kind}} of bracket named “Trunnion cap” which is used at some of the loaders and trucks that are developed at Atlas Copco Rock Drills AB in Örebro, the information is needed to create a technical guideline for design of new trunnion caps. The thesis is limited to investigate trunnion caps that are used to attach steering cylinders on six different vehicles, MT 436 B, MT 5020, MT 6020, ST 1030, ST 14 and ST 1520. It investigates what angles the force generated by the steering cylinders acts from, which varies from a range of 6 to 96 degrees depending on which vehicle and frame it is. The forces generated by the <b>steering</b> <b>cylinder</b> have also been calculated regarding the maximum pressure which is between 21, 5 and 30 MPa for the different vehicles. Any kind of useful information from customers has also been searched partly by asking employees at Atlas Copco customer centres around the world if they are aware of any occasions were trunnion caps or bolts to trunnion caps have broke down. The results indicate that no problems exist today and that old problems had to do with lack of service. Even the internal databases for service reports have been searched for failures that regard parts to trunnion caps but no relevant information was found. The tolerances for the holes in the trunnion caps and to the pins that are assembled to the trunnion caps has also been identified with a result that vary, some assemblies have a tight fitting while others have a loose fitting. Finally has the availability of bolts with property class 8. 8 and 10. 9 been investigated where it has been noticed that the lead time for bolts with property class 8. 8 more often is shorter than it is for bolts with property class 10. 9. Detta examensarbete sammanställer och tar fram information om en typ av fäste som kallas “Trunnion cap” som används på några av de truckar och lastare som utvecklas på Atlas Copco Rock Drills AB i Örebro. Informationen behövs för att skapa en konstruktionsriktlinje för trunnion caps. Arbetet är begränsat till att undersöka de trunnion caps som används vid infästning av styrcylindrar på sex olika fordon, MT 436 B, MT 5020, MT 6020, ST 1030, ST 14 och ST 1520. Det undersöker från vilka vinklar kraften som genereras av styrcylindern verkar från. Dessa vinklar verkar inom ett intervall från 6 till 96 grader. Själva kraften har också beräknats med avseende på maximalt styrtryck vilket varierar från 21, 5 till 30 MPa beroende på fordon. Värdefull information från kunder har också eftersökts delvis genom att fråga anställda vid några av Atlas Copcos marknadsbolag runt om i världen om de är medvetna om några tillfällen då trunnion caps eller bultar till trunnion caps har havererat. Svaren på denna fråga tyder på att inga problem existerar idag men att de problem som funnits tidigare berott på bristande service. Även Atlas Copcos interna databaser för servicerapporter har genomsökts på rapporter som rör delar till trunnion caps, dock utan att någon relevant information hittats. Examensarbetet har även sammanställt de toleranser som hålen i trunnion caps:en samt axeln som monteras dit har. Resultatet varierar då några sammanställningar har greppassning medan andra har spelpassning. Slutligen har även tillgängligheten på bult med hållfasthetsklass 8. 8 och 10. 9 undersökts där det har noterats att ledtiden för bult med hållfasthetsklass 8. 8 i allmänhet är kortare än för bultar med hållfasthetsklass 10. 9...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model and}} its simulation results of an agricultural vehicle electrohydraulic (E/H) steering system. The dynamic characteristics of an E/H steering system {{plays an important role}} in realizing accurate steering control for an automatically guided agricultural vehicle. E/H steering systems are typically nonlinear with large deadband, asymmetric flow gain, time delay, hysteresis, and saturation, which result in difficulties in the system analysis, design, and control. In this paper, a mathematical model has been developed for an E/H steering system. This model has taken the main components of the E/H steering system, including a PWM driver, an E/H proportional directional control valve, <b>steering</b> actuating <b>cylinders,</b> <b>steering</b> linkage, and wheel-ground interactions, into consideration. It was then linearized with assumptions of incompressible fluid, the zero lapped valve, and frictionless. This model has been validated via vehicle steering tests. A third order liner model with considering the deadband, saturation, and time delay could well approximate the dynamic response within the steering angle range of 15 to 15 degrees. The validated model was used to estimate the dynamic behaviors of E/H steering systems in steering controller design. Those parameters are critical for designing high performance steering controller...|$|R

This was made in analogue with systems already developed for use in tandem tractors (see for example Doe Triple-D). The first purpose built articulated hauler was DR 631, a 4x4, released in 1966 with a larger 6x6 model DR 860 being released in 1968. In 1974 Livab was absorbed into Volvo BM.|$|R
5000|$|In August 2013, Dyson sued Samsung Electronics over claims his company’s {{steering}} {{technology was}} infringed. The product that was targeted, Samsung's [...] "Motion Sync", allegedly infringed {{the design of}} a <b>steering</b> mechanism for <b>cylinder</b> cleaners, patented by Dyson in 2009. It describes a way to allow a vacuum cleaner to spin quickly from one direction to another on the spot, and to follow the user's path rather than just being dragged behind, in order to prevent the vacuum getting snagged on corners. But three months after it filed the lawsuit, Dyson voluntarily dropped the litigation for unknown reasons. Samsung filed a counter suit for ₤6 million for compensation for hurting Samsung's corporate image by portraying it as a repeat patent violator or copycat.|$|R
