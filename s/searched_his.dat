5|$|Shortly before Anselm {{went into}} exile in 1097 Warelwast <b>searched</b> <b>his</b> baggage, {{probably}} looking for communications to the pope, either from Anselm or other English bishops {{rather than for}} valuables, and in particular for any letters of complaint. Warelwast was the king's envoy at Rome when during his exile Anselm petitioned to have the king excommunicated, which according to Eadmer, who was also present, Warelwast succeeded in preventing by bribing the pope and papal officials. The king had sent Warelwast to Urban at Christmas 1098, with his reply to a letter the pope had written ordering the restoration of Anselm's estates.|$|E
5|$|When {{both men}} were arrested on 18 January, Carty said he was {{innocent}} of the allegations and claimed {{he had been in}} a pub in Kilburn with relatives and friends, and stayed the night at a relative's house. When police <b>searched</b> <b>his</b> home, they found a pair of trainers that forensic tests showed had a drop of ap Rhys Pryce's blood on one toe. DNA from several people, including Brown, were found on the trainers. Officers also found a top with traces of Brown's DNA, and fibres found on Pryce's overcoat were microscopically indistinguishable from the material of that top. Brown also said he had been in Kilburn {{the night of the murder}} and initially claimed that he had nothing to do with either the robbery of the other man or the robbery and murder of Pryce. When the mobile phone of the other victim (Ali) was discovered at his home, he claimed he had bought it from two men. Detectives also found that Brown had hoarded press cuttings of Pryce.|$|E

In 1616, Samuel More accused his wife Katherine More of adultery and bearing four children with Jacob Blakeway, a neighbour. Samuel More, under his father Richard's direction, removed the four children from their home. Four years later, without their mother's knowledge, they were transported to the New World on board the Pilgrim Fathers' ship the Mayflower.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} the {{criminal}} began acting more randomly, not attacking waitresses exclusively and even going after two women who were together. On May 15, specialists determined that the note had been produced in Dr. Octavian Ienişte's office in March 1971. He had seen 83 students that month, of whom 15, including Rîmaru, had not deposited their diagnoses with university officials. The police closely monitored each suspect and three officers went to his dormitory on May 27; he was not home but while they <b>searched</b> <b>his</b> room he came back at 1:00 pm. In his sack he had an ax and a knife; tests on the hair and bite marks he left and the testimony of witnesses left no reasonable doubt as to his guilt.|$|E
25|$|Four {{days after}} the body was discovered, Einem was {{questioned}} by the police about the murder of Kelvin. He initially claimed {{that he had no}} knowledge of what had happened to Kelvin and said that on the night of abduction he had been in bed with the flu. Police also <b>searched</b> <b>his</b> home in the northern Adelaide suburb of Paradise, and seized a bottle of Mandrax. Einem admitted that the drugs were his and said that he used them to help him sleep. He denied having any other drugs in his possession, but police also seized a bottle of Noctec, concealed on a ledge behind his wardrobe. Einem also allowed police to take hair and blood samples, as well as carpets and other materials for testing.|$|E

25|$|On April 17, Serafín Hernández Rivera Sr., a Brownsville native, {{was arrested}} in Houston by DEA and Texas Department of Public Safety agents. Federal charges were filed against him for {{importing}} marijuana, possession, and conspiracy. Two other men implicated with him were Quintana Rodríguez and Ponce Torres, both Mexican citizens. As the police <b>searched</b> <b>his</b> Houston home, they seized cash and weapons, but {{found no evidence of}} any cult paraphernalia or leads pointing to Constanzo. Houston police believed that Constanzo was probably hiding in Houston because he was linked to a $20 million failed cocaine operation that was busted there in June 1988. When the house was raided, investigators found ritualistic candles, an altar, and paperwork with Rivera's name on it. The police believed that Constanzo bought several properties across Houston in the past and were investigating if he had visited any of his alleged hangouts. Serafín Sr. cooperated with U.S. officials and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. He was released in June 1990 and returned to Brownsville.|$|E
25|$|A year later, Rudolph {{goes out}} to the {{reindeer}} games where all the other new fawns will be inspected by Santa and learn to pull his sleigh. During flight practice, Rudolph becomes acquainted with a beautiful doe named Clarice who tells him he's cute, which causes Rudolph to fly. However, while engaging in celebratory play with the other bucks, Rudolph's fake nose pops off, causing the others to make fun of him. Rudolph is then told he can no longer play in the reindeer games. Walking away, Rudolph meets up with Hermey, an elf who ran away from Santa's workshop because {{he wanted to be a}} dentist instead of making toys, and they decide to run away together. The pair then meet a prospector named Yukon Cornelius, who has fruitlessly <b>searched</b> <b>his</b> whole life for silver and gold. After escaping the Abominable Snow Monster of the North on an iceberg, the trio crash land on the Island of Misfit Toys where unloved or unwanted toys live with their ruler, a winged lion named King Moonracer. The king allows the group to stay one night on the island in exchange for returning to Christmastown to ask Santa to find homes for the unwanted toys. However, Rudolph awakens in the night and leaves the island on his own due to his concern that his nose, which attracts the Abominable, will endanger his friends.|$|E
