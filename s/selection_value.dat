40|$|The {{breakage}} {{of material}} in cone type gyratory crushers is traditionally regarded as relying upon single particle breakage. In {{the last ten}} years the emphasis has shifted with manufacturers trying to generate higher degrees of interparticle breakage. Increasing the degree of interparticle crushing is claimed to improve crushing efficiency and product shape. The current study uses form conditioned crushing tests (geometry controlled compression) to investigate how multiple particles respond to crushing loads. By variation of test parameters the breakage characteristics of a rock material can be determined and compared to traditional single particle crushing. The selection function, S (probability of crushing a single particle), seems {{to be related to the}} ratio between stroke and bed height, s/b, with a second order polynomial in s/b. An analysis of a given crusher chamber gives <b>selection</b> <b>values</b> in the range 0. 05 < S < 0. 4. Given the geometry of this chamber it is clear that much of the breakage will be interparticle. However, the <b>selection</b> <b>values</b> indicate that the efficiency of crushing is poor. Using the approach outlined a mechanistic crusher model has been developed. The model seeks to describe the crushing process in relation to the machine operating parameters, chamber geometry and the material characteristics of the feed. In this way predictions of material flow and product size gradation are obtained that can be used to improve the understanding and design of crushers. © 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

Our scheme is universally composable and thus, un-like previous results, preserves security when it is executed with multiple protocol instances that run concurrently in an adversarially controlled way. Furthermore, after an initialization phase of complexity O(N), each transfer phase is optimal in terms of rounds of communication and it has constant computational and communication cost. To achieve these prop-erties, we design the first efficient non-interactive proof of knowledge that a value lies in a given interval we are aware of...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the following sequential decision problem. Given a set of items of unknown utility, we need to select one of as high a utility as possible (``the selection problem''). Measurements (possibly noisy) of item values prior to selection are allowed, at a known cost. The goal is to optimize the overall sequential decision process of measurements and <b>selection.</b> <b>Value</b> of information (VOI) is a well-known scheme for selecting measurements, but the intractability of the problem typically leads to using myopic VOI estimates. In the selection problem, myopic VOI frequently badly underestimates the value of information, leading to inferior sensing plans. We relax the strict myopic assumption into a scheme we term semi-myopic, providing a spectrum of methods that can improve the performance of sensing plans. In particular, we propose the efficiently computable method of ``blinkered'' VOI, and examine theoretical bounds for special cases. Empirical evaluation of ``blinkered'' VOI in the selection problem with normally distributed item values shows that is performs much better than pure myopic VOI.

40|$|Investigations {{into the}} visual system {{development}} and function necessitate quantifiable behavioral models of visual performance {{that are easy}} to elicit, robust, and simple to manipulate. A suitable model has been found in the optokinetic response (OKR), a reflexive behavior present in all vertebrates due to its high <b>selection</b> <b>value.</b> The OKR involves slow stimulus-following movements of eyes alternated with rapid resetting saccades. The measurement of this behavior is easily carried out in zebrafish larvae, due to its early and stable onset (fully developed after 96 hours post fertilization (hpf)), and benefitting from the thorough knowledge about zebrafish genetics, for decades one of the favored model organisms in this field. Meanwhile the analysis of similar mechanisms in adult fish has gained importance, particularly for pharmacological and toxicological applications. Here we describe VisioTracker, a fully automated, high-throughput system for quantitative analysis of visual performance. The system is based on research carried out in the group of Prof. Stephan Neuhauss and was re-designed by TSE Systems. It consists of an immobilizing device for small fish monitored by a high-quality video camera equipped with a high-resolution zoom lens. The fish container is surrounded by a drum screen, upon which computer-generated stimulus patterns can be projected. Eye movements are recorded and automatically analyzed by the VisioTracker software package in real time. Data analysis enables immediate recognition of parameters such as slow and fast phase duration, movement cycle frequency, slow-phase gain, visual acuity, and contrast sensitivity. Typical results allow for example the rapid identification of visual system mutants that show no apparent alteration in wild type morphology, or the determination of quantitative effects of pharmacological or toxic and mutagenic agents on visual system performance...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{to analyze}} {{end-to-end}} timing behavior in heterogeneous processor and network environments accurately, we adopt a heterogeneous <b>selection</b> <b>value</b> on communication contention (HSV_CC) algorithm, which can synchronize tasks and messages simultaneously, for stream processing distribution. In order to adapt HSV_CC to automotive data stream management system (DSMSs), one must address three issues: (i) previous task and message schedules {{might lead to}} less efficient resource usages; (ii) the conventional method to determine the task scheduling order may not be best suited to deal with stream processing graphs, and; (iii) {{there is a need}} to be able to schedule tasks with time-varying computational requirements efficiently. To address (i), we propose the heterogeneous value with load balancing and communication contention (HVLB_CC) (A) algorithm, which considers load balancing in addition to the parameters considered by the HSV_CC algorithm. We propose HVLB_CC (B) to address issue (ii). HVLB_CC (B) can deal with stream processing task graphs and more various directed acyclic graphs to prevent assigning a higher priority to successor tasks. In addition, to address issue (iii), we propose HVLB_CC_IC. To schedule tasks more efficiently with various computation times, HVLB_CC_IC utilizes schedule holes left in processors. These idle time slots can be used for the execution of an optional part to generate more precise data results by applying imprecise computation models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms improve minimum schedule length, accuracy, and load balancing significantly compared to the HSV_CC algorithm. In addition, the proposed HVLB_CC (B) algorithm can schedule more varied task graphs without reducing performance, and, using imprecise computation models, HVLB_CC_IC yields higher precision data than HVLB_CC without imprecise computation models.
