5|$|Prior to 2007, the Staten Island Railway used Baltimore & Ohio Railroad style color {{position}} light signals that dated {{back to when}} it was a B line. In 2007, a $72 million project to replace the old <b>signal</b> <b>system</b> was completed. The system was replaced with an FRA-compliant 100Hz, track circuit based, Automatic Train Control (ATC) <b>signal</b> <b>system.</b> As part of the project, forty R44 subway cars and four locomotives were modified with on board cab signaling equipment for ATC bi-directional movement. A new rail control center and back-up control center was constructed as part of this contract.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the MTA {{has plans}} to {{automate}} a much larger portion, using One Person Train Operation (OPTO) in conjunction with CBTC. At the current pace of installation, it would take 175 years for CBTC to be installed {{at a cost of}} $20 billion. The Flushing line operated at almost 30 trains an hour using the <b>signal</b> <b>system</b> installed when the line was built, but after CBTC is installed it is possible that an additional two trains per hour could be operated.|$|E
5|$|Their {{training}} schedule {{consisted of}} individual training {{two or three}} times a week and two days a week of coordinated tandem training during the Olympic year. Marchant's main tactical responsibility was to look to the outside for impending attacks while Browne patrolled the inside. Marchant devised a <b>signal</b> <b>system,</b> such as a head bump on Browne's hip, or even a verbal shout when the opposition made a move.|$|E

50|$|Whereas common-channel <b>signaling</b> <b>systems</b> are {{out-of-band}} by definition, and in-band <b>signaling</b> <b>systems</b> {{are also}} necessarily channel-associated, the above metering pulse example demonstrates that there exist channel-associated <b>signaling</b> <b>systems</b> which are out-of-band.|$|R
40|$|As ATM becomes widely {{accepted}} as the communication standard for high speed networks, the <b>signaling</b> <b>system</b> structure and protocols that support ATM {{become more and}} more important. To support existing, future and unknown applications, the <b>signaling</b> <b>system</b> has to be very flexible and efficient. In this paper we de ne the signaling problem, present several possible <b>signaling</b> <b>system</b> structures, compare {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these systems, and then we propose a new <b>signaling</b> <b>system</b> structure. The fundamental idea of the new <b>signaling</b> <b>system</b> is the logical separation of the <b>signaling</b> <b>system</b> structure from the underlying communication network, even though they may be built on the same physical network. The proposed <b>signaling</b> <b>system</b> structure shows very promising performance in terms of signaling latency, scalability, and reliability...|$|R
5|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, the MTA has started several {{projects}} to maintain and improve the subway. In the 1990s, it started converting the BMT Canarsie Line to use communications-based train control, utilizing a moving block <b>signal</b> <b>system</b> that allowed more trains to use the tracks and thus increasing passenger capacity. After the Canarsie Line tests were successful, the MTA expanded the automation program in the 2000s and 2010s to include other lines. As part of another program called FASTRACK, the MTA started closing certain lines during weekday nights in 2012, {{with each of the}} lines closing overnight for a week in order to allow workers to clean these lines without being hindered by train movements. It expanded the program beyond Manhattan the next year after noticing how efficient the FASTRACK program was compared to previous service diversions. In 2015, the MTA announced a wide-ranging improvement program as part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program. Thirty stations would be extensively rebuilt under the Enhanced Station Initiative, and new R211 subway cars would be able to fit more passengers.|$|E
25|$|June 10, 2004: Service {{suspended}} at Shilong Road, Longcao Road and Caoxi Road for automatic <b>signal</b> <b>system</b> {{testing and}} restoration of land subsidence at these three stations. Service was restored at these stations on July 24.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} other rail lines, the <b>signal</b> <b>system</b> on the Market–Frankford Line has progressed from the {{original}} lineside block signals using semaphores, to three-aspect Type D color light (green, over yellow, over red) signals, to cab signalling, eliminating the lineside block signals except at interlockings.|$|E
30|$|Implementing uniform formats of <b>signaling</b> <b>system.</b> As long as {{we follow}} the {{principles}} of safe operation, different <b>signaling</b> <b>systems</b> will all have alternative choices all over the world. [7, 8] In the future, safety and reliability are still the priorities {{in the choice of}} <b>signaling</b> <b>systems</b> in <b>signal</b> transit field where safety is highly important. Although the moving block <b>signaling</b> <b>system</b> is relatively advanced, we suggest that moving block <b>signaling</b> <b>system</b> be applied to the modification of the existing lines and the construction of new lines gradually.|$|R
5000|$|A new <b>signalling</b> <b>system,</b> {{supplied}} by Thales, {{will replace the}} current ageing <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> on the North South Line. Upgrading works on the <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> for NSEW Line will be completed in phases from 2016. Commuters on the North-South Line can expect shorter waiting times as the upgraded <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> allows trains to run in shorter intervals. [...] The new system {{is expected to be}} operational from mid-March 2017.

25|$|The station's extra-long platforms, {{which allow}} for 11-car operation, {{are also a}} remnant of the joint service period. However, {{the rest of the}} {{stations}} on the line were only able to fit 9-car train sets. These platforms were extended to 11 cars in the late 1950s as the <b>signal</b> <b>system</b> was being improved on the Flushing Line.|$|E
25|$|Though {{capable of}} 200km/h (125mph) operation, this higher speed would require both track & <b>signal</b> <b>system</b> upgrade and the {{provision}} of a faster locomotive than the currently used 201 class. A possibility being considered is the replacement of the existing 201 with two power cars, one of which would be converted from the existing Generator Control Car.|$|E
25|$|In mid-2013, {{service on}} the Trillium Line was {{suspended}} for four months to implement service and track improvements such as new station platforms and two new passing tracks (near Brookfield and Gladstone). Upgrades were also made to the <b>signal</b> <b>system,</b> train controls, stations, tracks and train yard. A new Centralized Traffic Control system was installed to improve safety and efficiency.|$|E
25|$|A new <b>signalling</b> <b>system,</b> {{supplied}} by Thales, {{will replace the}} current ageing <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> on the North South Line. The upgrading works will be completed in phases from 2016. The upgraded <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> will shorten waiting times as trains {{will be able to}} run closer to each other.

30|$|<b>Signaling</b> <b>system’s</b> fault {{occurrence}} is inevitable. <b>Signaling</b> <b>system’s</b> {{operating performance}} {{is not only}} influenced by equipments, {{but it is also}} related to running intervals, and the efficiencies of maintaining technician and assistants in dealing with faults. As there are various influencing factors, it is impractical and technically impossible for <b>signaling</b> <b>system</b> to realize “zero defect” and “zero risk”.|$|R
25|$|When the {{installation}} of automated train operation required the complete replacement of the <b>signal</b> <b>system,</b> the MTA {{decided to make the}} entire line BMT Q and move chaining zero to the current compass western end of the line. Therefore, the chaining station of every location on the line had to be changed, a situation rarely seen since the Dual Contracts changes on the old BRT circa 1920.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{the fleet}} {{expansion}} program and <b>signal</b> <b>system</b> upgrade, the Port Authority has the option to order a total of 119additional PA5 cars as the option order; 44 of these cars would be to expand the NWK–WTC line to 10-car operation while the remaining 75cars {{would be used to}} increase service frequencies once Communication-based train control (CBTC) is implemented throughout the system in 2017.|$|E
25|$|Planning for {{phase one}} started in 2015 and was {{complete}} by February 2016, with major engineering work following in November 2016. In January 2017, L.K.

5000|$|When the Tuas West Extension {{opened on}} 18 June 2017, trains {{terminating}} at either Joo Koon or Tuas Link will dwell {{at the station}} for a longer amount of time. As the section of track between Pioneer and Joo Koon support 'mixed-mode' of both <b>signalling</b> <b>systems,</b> all trains calling at the westbound platform (towards Joo Koon or the TWE) would have to change from the legacy fixed <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> to the newer CBTC <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> at this station as trains terminating at Joo Koon would proceed to a turn back siding which was built {{as part of the}} TWE which only supports the new <b>signalling</b> <b>system.</b> Eastbound trains (towards Pasir Ris) would have to revert back to the legacy fixed-block <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> at this station.|$|R
50|$|The term is only {{relevant}} {{in the case}} of <b>signalling</b> <b>systems</b> that use discrete signals (e.g. a combination of tones to denote one digit), as opposed to <b>signalling</b> <b>systems</b> which are message-oriented, such as <b>Signaling</b> <b>System</b> 7 (SS7) and ISDN Q.931, where each message is able to convey multiple items of information (e.g. multiple digits of the called telephone number).|$|R
40|$|As {{existing}} {{electrical and}} mechanical railway <b>signalling</b> <b>systems</b> are replaced with systems using computer technologies, system capability has improved {{in such a}} way that the system is intellectualised. The railway <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> is a vital system that is directly connected to massive life damage or economical loss due to its features. Therefore strict safety activity and assessment methodology are be required. There are several international standards for railway <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> safety activity requirements, which are required to demonstrate those safety activities. <b>Signalling</b> <b>system</b> safety assessment is performed by analysing and evaluating the system safety activity process and its results. In this paper, we suggest railway <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> safety activity techniques for the railway <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> safety assessment and its specific execution techniques at each activity phase. We also analyse safety assessment tasks based on suggested safety activity techniques and identify the necessary case study required to ensure the safety of assessment techniques...|$|R
25|$|In July 2016, the MBTA Fiscal and Management Control Board {{approved}} a $18.5 million contract to complete work along {{the remainder of}} the southern branches. The work includes all remaining third rail replacement, track work between Fields Corner and Savin Hill, <b>signal</b> <b>system</b> work between North Quincy and Braintree, and track replacement at Quincy Center, Quincy Adams, and Braintree. The work will be completed {{in the second half of}} 2016.|$|E
25|$|The CBTC {{project was}} first {{proposed}} in 1994 {{and approved by}} the MTA in 1997. Installation of the <b>signal</b> <b>system</b> was begun in 2000. Initial testing began in 2004, and installation was mostly completed by December 2006, with all CBTC-equipped R143 subway cars in service by that date. Due to an unexpected ridership increase on the Canarsie Line, the MTA ordered more R160 cars and these were put into service in 2010. This enabled the agency to operate up to 26 trains per hour up from the May 2007 service level of 15 trains per hour, an achievement that would not be possible without the CBTC technology or a redesign of the previous automatic block <b>signal</b> <b>system.</b> The R143s and R160s both use Trainguard MT CBTC, supplied by Siemens. In the 2015–2019 Capital Program, funding was provided for three more electrical substations for the line so that it could accommodate even more trains per hour. Also included in the Capital Program is the installation of automatic signals on the line to facilitate the movement of work trains between interlockings.|$|E
25|$|Enhancements to the Danbury Branch {{being studied}} also include re-electrification {{of the branch}} (the branch was {{electrified}} from 1925 to 1961), addition of passing sidings, realignment and/or super-elevation of track to eliminate or alleviate curvature and enhance speeds, and installation of automated train control signalling. The new <b>signal</b> <b>system</b> finally began operation in 2013, but extensive work was still ongoing in 2014 because of unresolved problems with the drop gates at grade crossings.|$|E
50|$|The total {{construction}} {{cost was}} €1.42 billion. The <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> installed is the TVM-430 in-cab <b>signalling</b> <b>system,</b> {{the same as}} LGV Nord in France, and High Speed 1 in the UK.|$|R
50|$|The <b>signalling</b> <b>systems</b> {{in the two}} {{countries}} are also different. The problems were overcome by requiring all trains operating on the line to be dual voltage and have dual <b>signalling</b> <b>systems,</b> including a minority of the X2 trains operated throughout Sweden by SJ. The <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> switches on Peberholm in Denmark, while the entire bridge uses the Danish electrical <b>system.</b> The Danish <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> is only approved for 180 km/h speed, while the Swedish system is approved for 200 km/h. The entire bridge has 200 km/h maximum speed, also the Danish part, as the only railway in Denmark.|$|R
50|$|By contrast, the L1 <b>signaling</b> <b>system</b> (which {{typically}} {{employs a}} 2280 Hz tone of various durations) is an in-band channel-associated <b>signaling</b> <b>system</b> {{as was the}} SF 2600 hertz system formerly used in the Bell System.|$|R
25|$|The {{campaign}} did {{not start}} against the RAF until August. Throughout the intervening period, the Luftwaffe undertook its third major operational move within the space of two months. The first had seen it push forward its Air Fleets into the Low Countries and the second into southern France. Now it was expanded into northern France and Belgium, along the English Channel coast. It took time to establish the <b>signal</b> <b>system</b> in France owing to a shortage of trained staff officers while the units replenished after losses through the Ergänzungsverbände (supplemental formations).|$|E
25|$|The Automatic Train Supervision {{sub-system}} {{provides for}} headway management and proper interleaving of trains at junctions by speeding up or slowing down trains. The system works via {{a series of}} track mounted balises, which function as information beacons transmitting a speed code to the train as it passes overhead. Its designers intended its function to be non-vital, and for this reason, the design is not fail-safe. At no point can the ATC system override the maximum speed limit enforced by the cab <b>signal</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|In January 2010, Siemens {{announced}} that PATH would be spending $321 million to upgrade its <b>signal</b> <b>system</b> using Siemens' Trainguard MT CBTC to accommodate anticipated growth in ridership. The system {{will reduce the}} headway time between trains, so trains move more efficiently through the system and passenger wait times are reduced. Trainguard MT CBTC will equip the tracks and 130 of the 340 new EMU being constructed by Kawasaki Railcar. The goal is to increase passenger capacity from the current 240,000 passengers to 290,000 passengers per day. The entire system is expected to become operational in 2017.|$|E
5000|$|A new <b>signalling</b> <b>system,</b> {{supplied}} by Thales, {{will replace the}} current ageing <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> on the East West Line and will equip all future extensions to the line, beginning with the Tuas West Extension.
