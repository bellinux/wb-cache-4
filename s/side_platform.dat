5|$|The {{station has}} three tracks, an island {{platform}}, and a <b>side</b> <b>platform.</b> All service {{is on the}} island platform as of May 2013.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, the MBTA {{published}} a feasibility study exploring {{the possibility of}} rebuilding Yawkey as a full-service station. The study concluded that doing so would increase ridership by 60%, from 585 daily boardings and alightings to 937. On November 15, 2010, Governor Deval Patrick and other officials broke ground on a major rebuilding of the station, originally {{expected to be completed}} in the spring of 2012. The new station has two full-length high-level platforms that provide level, handicapped-accessible boarding for all passengers; the old platform had only a wooden ramp for accessibility. The two 700-foot-long platforms (a <b>side</b> <b>platform</b> between the tracks plus a <b>side</b> <b>platform</b> {{on the south side of}} the tracks) are connected with an overpass, and passengers no longer have to cross the tracks to access certain outbound trains.|$|E
5|$|Extending {{the line}} to a new subway/LIRR {{terminal}} at Thomson Avenue within the Sunnyside Yard, with a walking transfer to the Queens Plaza station, and a transfer to a new LIRR route that would go to Rosedale and Queens Village via the Montauk Branch. The LIRR would be rebuilt, grade-separated, and electrified. The Richmond Hill station would be renovated for additional LIRR service, while the Hollis and Queens Village stations would be converted from <b>side</b> <b>platform</b> stations to island platform configurations. This $488 million option, {{to be completed by}} 1995, was also opposed by people living along the Montauk Branch.|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} two {{elevated}} <b>side</b> <b>platforms.</b> This {{is the only}} station of the line that has two <b>side</b> <b>platforms,</b> as all the others stations have one (or two) island platforms.|$|R
5000|$|Funamachi Station has two <b>side</b> <b>platforms</b> {{built on}} an embankment, {{connected}} by an underpass crossing. The area {{in between the}} <b>side</b> <b>platforms</b> is filled in, forming what is effectively an island platform.|$|R
50|$|Larger {{stations}} {{may have}} two <b>side</b> <b>platforms</b> with several island platforms in between. Some {{are in a}} Spanish solution format, with two <b>side</b> <b>platforms</b> and an island platform in between, serving two tracks.|$|R
5|$|Mukilteo is a {{train station}} serving the city of Mukilteo, Washington. It is owned by Sound Transit, who runs the North Line of their Sounder {{commuter}} rail service through the station from Everett to King Street Station in Seattle. The station includes a parking lot with 63 spaces, as well as connections to nearby Washington State Ferries, Community Transit, and Everett Transit service on State Route 525. Mukilteo station opened in 2008 with a single <b>side</b> <b>platform,</b> later supplemented with a second platform and pedestrian overpass in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Readville has {{an unusual}} layout {{because it is}} built on the {{crossing}} of two rail lines. The Fairmount Line and Franklin Line each have a single track atop an embankment. The Fairmount Line has a single <b>side</b> <b>platform,</b> while the Franklin Line has two. The Fairmount Line track continues atop a bridge over the Northeast Corridor to join with the Franklin Line. This connection is used by several trains each rush hour, allowing trains from the Franklin Line to avoid congestion in the crowded Southwest Corridor.|$|E
5|$|The first {{station to}} be rebuilt was Old Saybrook, the busy eastern {{terminus}} of the line. The new high-level island platform and pedestrian bridge opened on November 1, 2002. Old Saybrook had previous had only a single <b>side</b> <b>platform</b> serving {{a relatively small number}} of Amtrak trains; the rebuilt has two platforms serving three tracks, to allow Amtrak trains in both directions to stop or pass even while a SLE train is at the station.|$|E
50|$|The station had two {{staggered}} <b>side</b> <b>platforms</b> and {{a central}} island platform, serving four tracks. Access between platforms was via an underpass. The two <b>side</b> <b>platforms</b> {{were used in}} case of difficulty or track maintenance.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} twin tracks, with two <b>side</b> <b>{{platform}}s</b> and a central island <b>platform.</b> The <b>side</b> <b>platforms</b> {{are used for}} boarding, whilst the central platform is used for alighting, a configuration that {{is known as the}} Barcelona solution.|$|R

5|$|Construction {{started at}} this station in 1969, {{and as a}} result of the New York City fiscal crisis in 1975, the station did not open until 1989. Originally, the station was {{intended}} to be a transfer point between passengers from the Sixth Avenue–Queens service and from the Broadway–Second Avenue service. This station was designed to allow for cross-platform transfers. However, in 1975, while the station was being built, construction was halted on the Second Avenue Subway. As a result, the side of the station intended for service to Second Avenue, the BMT side, was walled off with a temporary orange brick wall. Also, space intended for an exit at Third Avenue was left unused. While the Sixth Avenue side opened for service in 1989, the other side was only used for storing Broadway Line trains. The station appeared as if it had one <b>side</b> <b>platform</b> on each level.|$|E
5|$|The {{northbound}} platform, {{currently a}} <b>side</b> <b>platform,</b> {{can serve as}} an island platform should passenger service return to the NECR track. The 2010 SCCOG report indicated that Amtrak wished Shore Line East to move its operations to Track 6, freeing the mainline tracks for through trains. In 2013, most Shore Line East trains began using Track 6. Most passengers use the low-level section of the platform south of State Street, but a short metal spur on the high-level platform provides handicapped accessible boarding for trains using the track. A low-level section of the northbound platform also remains north of the high-level section; {{it has not been}} used since the high-level section was constructed.|$|E
5|$|A {{commuter}} rail station in Mukilteo {{had been part}} of the original Sound Transit proposal rejected in 1995 and adopted the following year, as part of a Seattle–Everett line on the existing BNSF corridor. The agency selected the station site in 1999, choosing a platform east of State Route 525 and the Washington State Ferries terminal over one at Mukilteo Lighthouse Park because of concerns arising from existing parking and traffic issues in the area. A groundbreaking ceremony was held in August 2007 for the initial phase of the project, the northern <b>side</b> <b>platform,</b> as part of a multimodal transit hub built in conjunction with a new Mukilteo ferry terminal. The $19.2 million project, including preparations for a second phase to open in 2009, was funded by Sound Transit with a grant from the Federal Transit Administration. Sounder service from Mukilteo Station began on May 31, 2008, with a special weekend round-trip run to a Seattle Mariners game. The project was praised by local politicians for its multi-agency cooperation, especially between Sound Transit and Washington State Ferries.|$|E

50|$|Asano Station has {{an island}} {{platform}} (platforms 1 and 2) and two opposed <b>side</b> <b>platforms</b> (platforms 3 and 4) serving four tracks.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} twin tracks, with two <b>side</b> <b>{{platform}}s</b> and a central island <b>platform.</b> The <b>side</b> <b>platforms</b> {{are used for}} boarding, whilst the central platform is used for alighting, a configuration that {{is known as the}} Barcelona solution. In the case of La Bonanova, the centre platform is long enough to accommodate a four car train, but the <b>side</b> <b>platforms</b> are shorter, meaning that it is only possible to board three of the train's cars from them.|$|R
5|$|The Anderson Street {{station is}} located at the {{intersection}} with Anderson Street and Linden Avenue in Hackensack. The station has one track running through it, with one lone asphalt <b>side</b> <b>platform</b> appearing on the northbound side. The station has a nearby parking lot at the same intersection, with fifty parking spaces maintained by Park America (under lease from New Jersey Transit). Two of these fifty parking spaces are handicap accessible, although the station itself is not. These parking spots are permit-only, but are free to use on evenings and weekends. The station is located in New Jersey Transit's fifth fare zone, tickets may be purchased at the station. Except for the Metro-North Railroad Express routes to Spring Valley, all trains serve the Anderson Street station, and there is nearby access to the 175 and 770 New Jersey Transit bus lines. The station is 18 minutes from Secaucus Junction, 21 minutes from Hoboken Terminal, and 39 minutes from Spring Valley.|$|E
25|$|Finally the {{southern}} <b>side</b> <b>platform</b> is numbered 7, and can accommodate a thirteen coach train. Sufficient space exists {{to the south}} of this platform to add a second platform face, effectively converting this <b>side</b> <b>platform</b> into an island platform, if traffic increases to justify it.|$|E
25|$|Trains {{on track}} 18 open their doors {{only on the}} north <b>side</b> (<b>platform</b> J).|$|E

25|$|Broadway Junction on the BMT Canarsie Line has two tracks, one island {{platform}}, and one <b>side</b> <b>platform.</b> Manhattan-bound trains use {{the island}} platform for northbound service while Canarsie-bound trains use the <b>side</b> <b>platform</b> for southbound service (similar to {{the configuration of}} the Bowling Green station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line). However, unlike Bowling Green, the latter can use the island platform if necessary.|$|E
25|$|In {{the station}} itself is one curved five-car-long <b>side</b> <b>platform</b> serving a single balloon loop track.|$|E
25|$|The {{station has}} one six-car-long {{high-level}} <b>side</b> <b>platform</b> {{on the north}} side of the main track. A siding is on the south side of the main track.|$|E

25|$|This {{station has}} one {{high-level}} <b>side</b> <b>platform</b> {{south of the}} tracks that is long enough for {{one and a half}} cars to receive and discharge passengers. The Main Line has three tracks at this location: one is a siding and one is a freight spur.|$|E
25|$|Essendon has one island {{platform}} with two faces and one <b>side</b> <b>platform.</b> It is serviced by Metro Trains' Craigieburn line services and V/Line Seymour services. Platform 1 is rarely used, {{but it is}} used by V/Line services to overtake Metro Trains services, or when 3 car trains are terminating.|$|E
25|$|The station {{currently}} has five tracks, three island platforms and one <b>side</b> <b>platform</b> {{in a basement}} four stories underground. The new Platform A, next to tracks 1 and 2, opened {{as part of the}} Transportation Hub on February 25, 2014. Platform B between tracks 2 and 3 opened on May 7, 2015. The other two platforms opened on September 8, 2016.|$|E
