5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, the {{diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's disease was reserved for individuals {{between the ages of}} 45 and 65 who developed symptoms of dementia. The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on AD concluded that the clinical and pathological manifestations of presenile and <b>senile</b> <b>dementia</b> were almost identical, although the authors also added that this did not {{rule out the possibility that}} they had different causes. This eventually led to {{the diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's disease independent of age. The term <b>senile</b> <b>dementia</b> of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) was used for a time to describe the condition in those over 65, with classical Alzheimer's disease being used to describe those who were younger. Eventually, the term Alzheimer's disease was formally adopted in medical nomenclature to describe individuals of all ages with a characteristic common symptom pattern, disease course, and neuropathology.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} {{registered the}} cause of death as <b>senile</b> <b>dementia.</b> However, Smetana's family believed that his physical and mental decline was due to syphilis. An analysis of the autopsy report, published by the German neurologist Dr Ernst Levin in 1972, came to the same conclusion. Tests carried out by Prof. Emanuel Vlček in the late 20th century on samples of muscular tissue from Smetana's exhumed body provided further evidence of the disease. However, this research has been challenged by Czech physician Dr Jiří Ramba, who has argued that Vlček's tests do not provide a basis for a reliable conclusion, citing the age and state of the tissues and highlighting reported symptoms of Smetana's that were incompatible with syphilis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDeveloped regions, {{including}} Japan, {{have become}} “aged societies,” {{and the number}} of adults with <b>senile</b> <b>dementias,</b> such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, has also increased in such regions. Neurotrophins (NTs) {{may play a role in}} the treatment of AD because endogenous neurotrophic factors (NFs) prevent neuronal death. However, peptidyl compounds have been unable to cross the blood–brain barrier in clinical studies. Thus, small molecules, which can mimic the functions of NFs, might be promising alternatives for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Natural products, such as or nutraceuticals or those used in traditional medicine, can potentially be used to develop new therapeutic agents against neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we introduced the neurotrophic activities of polyphenols honokiol and magnolol, which are the main constituents of Magnolia obovata Thunb, and methanol extracts from Zingiber purpureum (BANGLE), which may have potential therapeutic applications in various neurodegenerative disorders...|$|R
40|$|The paired helical {{filament}} (PHF) is {{the principal}} constituent of the neurofibrillary tangles {{that occur in the}} brain in <b>senile</b> <b>dementias</b> of the Alzheimer type. We have previously shown from fragmentation patterns of isolated PHFs that they consist of a regularly repeating subunit, which is axially compact and not an extended fibrous molecule or protofilament. Here we present diffraction patterns of PHFs and an objective reconstruction of the cross-sectional density of the PHF computed from the diffraction patterns. We demonstrate the presence of an axial periodicity (3 nm) in PHFs. These results establish conclusively that the PHF is made up of a double helical stack of transversely oriented subunits, each of which has three domains, and precludes purely descriptive models based on helical rearrangements of preformed cytoskeletal polymers or protofilaments. The structure is of the type that might arise by the de novo assembly of a single structural subunit, which appears to be produced in considerable abundance in those neurons where tangles form...|$|R

After the {{parenthesis}} of the Spanish Civil War, {{she came back}} to the stage, as part of several flamenco shows, together with artists like Concha Piquer. After this, she retired for a few years, and came back with a show called España y su Cantaora (Spain and her singer), together with her husband, which she toured for a few months and was acclaimed by the critics. Then she definitely retired again. In 1961 she received an homage in Córdoba, in which several well-known flamenco artists took part, such as Antonio Mairena, Juan Talega, Manuel Morao, or Fernando Terremoto. In 1968, a monument was built in her honour in her quarter of Alameda de Hércules. In the last three years of her life, she was completely retired owing to <b>senile</b> <b>dementia.</b> She died in 1969, {{a month and a half}} after her husband. In that same year, singer Anotnio Mairena recorded his album Honores a la Niña de los Peines in homage to her.

500|$|The ancient Greek and Roman {{philosophers}} and physicians associated old age with increasing dementia. It {{was not until}} 1901 that German psychiatrist Alois Alzheimer identified the first case of {{what became known as}} Alzheimer's disease, named after him, in a fifty-year-old woman he called Auguste D. He followed her case until she died in 1906, when he first reported publicly on it. During the next five years, eleven similar cases were reported in the medical literature, some of them already using the term Alzheimer's disease. The disease was first described as a distinctive disease by Emil Kraepelin after suppressing some of the clinical (delusions and hallucinations) and pathological features (arteriosclerotic changes) contained in the original report of Auguste D. He included Alzheimer's disease, also named presenile dementia by Kraepelin, as a subtype of <b>senile</b> <b>dementia</b> in the eighth edition of his Textbook of Psychiatry, published on [...] 1910.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{find the}} effect of {{hyperbaric}} oxygen combined with memantine and Aricept treatment of <b>senile</b> vascular <b>dementia</b> on serum indicators and endothelial function. Methods: A total of 126 cases of patients with <b>senile</b> vascular <b>dementia</b> treated in our hospital from March 2012 to December 2014 were selected as research subjects, treatment that patients received was retrospectively analyzed, and patients were divided into observation group 64 cases and control group 62 cases. Control group received memantine and Aricept therapy, observation group received hyperbaric oxygen combined with memantine and Aricept therapy, and then differences in levels of serum TGF-β, IGF- 1 and ICAM- 1, Hcy, MDA and SOD, NPY, sFas, sFasL and so on, ET and EPC between two groups were compared. Results: Serum TGF-β ad IGF- 1 levels of observation group after treatment were {{higher than those of}} control group, and ICAM- 1 levels were lower than those of control group; Hcy and MDA levels of observation group after treatment were lower than those of control group at corresponding points in time, and SOD levels were higher than those of control group; serum NPY, sFas, sFasL and Ca 2 + values of observation group after treatment were lower than those of control group, and PON- 1 value was higher than that of control group; ET values of observation group at various points in time after treatment were lower than those of control group, and EPC contents were higher than those of control group. Conclusion: Hyperbaric oxygen combined with memantine and Aricept treatment for patients with <b>senile</b> vascular <b>dementia</b> can effectively improve the disease and optimize endothelial function, and it has active clinical significance. ...|$|R
40|$|Neurodegenerative {{diseases}} (NDs) {{are a large}} {{class of}} pathologies that include Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD) and many other forms of <b>senile</b> <b>dementias.</b> The unique transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), known as prion diseases, are among the rarest of these disorders. NDs belong to age-related disorders, thus their incidence and prevalence are estimated to increase dramatically as the population ages. So far, no early diagnostic tool has been developed. NDs are usually diagnosed at very advanced stages, when neurological symptoms are evident. Conventional therapies are directed at treating the neurological symptoms, but {{have no effect on}} disease progression. Thus, the development of novel early diagnostic tools and effective therapies for NDs today {{is one of the major}} scientific challenges. Recent evidence points at a common mechanism of pathogenesis in all NDs, which involves abnormal aggregation and deposition of misfolded proteins in the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, recent studies suggest that these aggregates may spread among cells in a prion-like manner, leading to cytotoxicity and cell death. These facts suggest that novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to different neurodegenerative disorders may share similar characteristics. Here, we provide an overview of the most advanced and modern techniques in use to diagnose NDs, and of the various attempts at finding an effective cure for these ever increasing disorders...|$|R
40|$|Muscarone analogues are {{compounds}} {{that have been}} proposed for the prevention or treatment of <b>senile</b> <b>dementias.</b> ARL- 16607 1), ARL- 15467 (11), ARL- 14995 (III) and YM- 796 (IV) are spiromuscar- 3 -one derivatives and behave as muscarinic M- 1 agonists, with different binding selectivity and efficacy at the M, receptors. In this work, we have elucidated the solid-state structures of I-III and compared the results obtained with the data available in the literature for TV. The solid-state arrangements of I-IV have then been used to input a series of theoretical calculations. For each molecule, eight conformations have been modeled and the obtained structures (1 - 32) have been submitted {{to a series of}} molecular dynamics/simulated annealing and molecular mechanics calculations aimed to explore the conformational freedom of the spiromuscar- 3 -one moiety. Some hints about the reactivity of I-IV have been obtained by performing Hartree-Fock, density functional theory and semiempirical quantum mechanics calculations. These studies analyzed the properties of the frontier orbitals and of the molecular electrostatic potential of I-IV. The information gained has been used to explain the better efficacy and poorer selectivity shown by III. Our results suggest that the behavior of III is due to its smaller size, the features of its molecular surface, the shape of its electrostatic potential and the orientation of its reactive domains...|$|R

40|$|Thyroid {{disorders}} {{are known to}} manifest occasionally as isolated psychiatric disorders. In order to determine whether thyroid dysfunctions could {{play a significant role}} in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders in the elderly, the prevalence of thyroid disorders was compared in a group of psychogeriatric patients and in a group of nonpsychiatric elderly patients. Thyroid function screening was performed in 157 patients consecutively admitted to a psychogeriatric unit, and the prevalence of hypothyroidism was determined in the different groups of psychiatric disorders (<b>senile</b> and multi-infarct <b>dementia,</b> organic brain syndrome of other etiologies, psychotic depression, neurotic depression, chronic delusional state, acute confusional state, and personality disorder). Thyroid function screening was performed similarly in 104 unselected elderly patients admitted to the medico-surgical admission unit of the University hospital to assess the prevalence of hypothyroidism in a general, nonpsychiatric, elderly population. Eight patients were diagnosed as hypothyroid based on an elevated basal thyrotropin (TSH) and on thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) test in the total number of patients, two in the nonpsychiatric and six in the psychiatric group. Three had clinical hypothyroidism, with decreased total and free T 4 and T 3 plasma levels in addition to increased basal TSH, five had biochemical hypothyroidism, with normal T 4 and T 3 levels and an excess TSH response to oral TRH. The prevalence of hypothyroidism in the two groups did not differ significantly (1. 9 % in the nonpsychiatric versus 3. 8 % in the psychiatric group).

Spatial filtering of electron micrographs by Fourier techniques shows that the individual particles that make up the arrays have a characteristic shape previously reported for the large subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Vascular {{factors are}} {{recognized}} as important risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, although it is unknown whether these factors directly lead to the typical degenerative pathology such as medial temporal lobe atrophy. We set out to investigate the relation between blood pressure and medial temporal lobe atrophy in patients with senile and presenile Alzheimer's disease with or without white matter lesions. METHODS: We determined the relation between blood pressure and pulse pressure and medial temporal lobe atrophy on MRI in 159 patients with Alzheimer's disease, stratified on white matter lesions and age at onset of dementia. RESULTS: There was a linear relation between systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure (both in tertiles) and the severity of medial temporal lobe atrophy (p(trend) = 0. 05 and p(trend) 0. 03, respectively). A significant relation was found between pulse pressure [beta = 0. 08 (95 % CI: 0. 00 - 0. 15; p = 0. 05) per 10 mm Hg] and (borderline significant) systolic blood pressure [beta = 0. 05 (95 % CI: - 0. 01 to 0. 11; p = 0. 1) per 10 mm Hg] and medial temporal lobe atrophy. White matter lesions and age-stratified analysis revealed a significant association between systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure and medial temporal lobe atrophy, only in the subsample with white matter lesions and in the subsample with a <b>senile</b> onset of <b>dementia.</b> The relations were independent of severity of dementia and diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: Systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure are associated with medial temporal lobe atrophy in Alzheimer's disease, especially {{in the presence of}} white matter lesions and in patients with a late onset of dementia. Our finding may be another step in providing a rationale on how vascular factors could ultimately result in Alzheimer's disease...|$|R
