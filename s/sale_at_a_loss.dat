50|$|When the {{law school}} was first {{organized}} in 2003, the school was operated out of a building at 560 King St. (pictured above) while work progressed on its future location. Although the school left that building within one year, the school's physical plant has always been located in Charleston's Upper King Street district. During its first year in operation, the school was located at 81 Mary St. (pictured above), in an antebellum railroad station. That building continues {{to serve as the}} school's law library, while most classrooms, offices, and other uses have moved to new locations as the school has grown and acquired new space. The school has leased space in nearby buildings including {{a large portion of the}} AT&T Building at the southwest corner of Mary and Meeting Streets and administrative space at 394 Meeting St. (designed by Leonard C. Gaines in 1955),. In 2004, the school purchased a 1.25 acre lot at the corner of Woolfe St. and Meeting St. from the City of Charleston for $875,000; no improvements have been added, but the <b>sale</b> (<b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> to the City) was made to keep the school on the peninsula.|$|E
40|$|The unfair-trade {{codes of}} the GATT/WTO are suited to {{addressing}} complaints from manufacturing than agriculture. This {{is because the}} seasonality and uncertainty of agricultural output, together with substantial use of contracting with factors of production, makes <b>sales</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>a</b> rational business practice during certain times of the year. This cost dumping induces the use of constructed values in the calculation of dumping margins by the US, which typically generates high duties. The model provides for cyclical dumping arising as a supply phenomenon. This contrasts with cyclical dumping in manufacturing that is induced by demand fluctuations.
