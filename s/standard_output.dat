2500|$|Scheme's {{input and}} output {{is based on the}} port datatype. (R5RS sec 6.6) [...] R5RS defines two default ports, {{accessible}} with the procedures current-input-port and current-output-port, which correspond to the Unix notions of standard input and <b>standard</b> <b>output.</b> Most implementations also provide current-error-port. Redirection of input and <b>standard</b> <b>output</b> is supported in the standard, by standard procedures such as with-input-from-file and with-output-to-file. [...] Most implementations provide string ports with similar redirection capabilities, enabling many normal input-output operations to be performed on string buffers instead of files, using procedures described in SRFI 6. The R6RS standard specifies much more sophisticated and capable port procedures and many new types of port.|$|E

40|$|The {{eukaryotic}} transcriptome {{is composed}} of thousands of coding and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). However, we lack a software platform to identify both RNA classes in a given transcriptome. Here we introduce Annocript, a pipeline that combines the annotation of protein coding transcripts with the prediction of putative lncRNAs in whole transcriptomes. It downloads and indexes the needed databases, runs the analysis and produces human readable and <b>standard</b> <b>outputs</b> together with summary statistics of the whole analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} elementary {{circuit components}} which exhibit self-checking properties; however, {{which do not}} utilize any additional signals to indicate the fault. The fault is indicated by generating specific values at some of <b>standard</b> <b>outputs</b> of a given circuit. In particular, various evolved adders containing conventional as well as polymorphic gates are proposed with less than duplication overhead which are able to detect a reasonable number of stuck-at-faults by oscillations at the carry-out output when the control signal of polymorphic gates oscillates. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{provide a}} {{theoretical}} {{analysis of the}} performance of differential predictive coding using fixed-lag smoothing of the <b>standard</b> decoder <b>output.</b> This performance is compared to related results for coding using latency at the encoder, and causal encoding with delayed decoding, as well as with some prior theoretical analyses of these methods. Surprisingly, it is shown that fixed-lag smoothing of the <b>standard</b> decoder <b>output</b> with causal encoding achieves the asymptotic and finite lag performance promised by a completely reoptimized decoder.

For example, we {{would like to}} be able to write: ...|$|E
2500|$|If no [...] block {{matches the}} type of the thrown exception, the {{execution}} of the outer block (or method) containing the [...] statement is discontinued, and the exception is passed up and outside the containing block or method. The exception is propagated upwards through the call stack until a matching [...] block is found within one of the currently active methods. If the exception propagates {{all the way up to}} the top-most [...] method without a matching [...] block being found, the entire program is terminated and a textual description of the exception is written to the <b>standard</b> <b>output</b> stream.|$|E
2500|$|Bash's syntax {{has many}} {{extensions}} {{lacking in the}} Bourne shell. Bash can perform integer calculations ("arithmetic evaluation") without spawning external processes. It uses the ((…)) command and the $((…)) variable syntax for this purpose. Its syntax simplifies I/O redirection. For example, it can redirect <b>standard</b> <b>output</b> (stdout) and standard error (stderr) {{at the same time}} using the &> operator. This is simpler to type than the Bourne shell equivalent 'command > file 2>&1'. [...] Bash supports process substitution using the <(command) and >(command)syntax, which substitutes the output of (or input to) a command where a filename is normally used. [...] (This is implemented through /proc/fd/ unnamed pipes on systems that support that, or via temporary named pipes where necessary).|$|E

As their {{areas have been}} largely unchanged since the 19th century this allows for comparison of population figures {{over an extended period}} of time. (Refer to map:) The following individual parish population figures, giving a total population of 12,650 at the 2011 Census for the 13 Civil Parishes (1930 boundaries), were extracted from Census Table QS112SC using the interactive <b>Standard</b> <b>Outputs</b> system at the Scotland's Census website.|$|R

30|$|The <b>standard</b> {{potential}} <b>output</b> methodology considers CPI inflation {{a sufficient}} statistic of all macroeconomic imbalances. Therefore, one required property of <b>standard</b> potential <b>output</b> estimates {{would be for}} them to be unrelated to other macroeconomic imbalances. Another desirable property of real time potential growth estimates is that they should be unrelated to ex-post output gaps. Both properties would, in principle, entail relatively minor revisions of potential growth estimates when new information arrives. However, the following stylised facts reveal that neither of those desirable properties holds and, therefore, the standard potential growth estimates are providing misleading signals of the magnitude of the economic slack and, ultimately, of the imbalances that the economy faces.|$|R
