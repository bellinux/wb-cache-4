5000|$|Within many {{switched}} telecommunications systems, it {{is possible}} to establish a permanent circuit. One example might be a telephone in the lobby of a public building, which is programmed to ring only the number of a telephone dispatcher. [...] "Nailing down" [...] a <b>switched</b> <b>connection</b> saves the cost of running a physical circuit between the two points. The resources in such a connection can be released when no longer needed, for example, a television circuit from a parade route back to the studio.|$|E
50|$|For the {{stored program}} control exchanges of the early 1970s, many relays were made with steel cores that {{remained}} magnetized after current ceased to flow in the winding. This magnetic latching feature, different {{from the use of}} slugs to delay relay operation, was used in the arrays of reed relays that <b>switched</b> <b>connection</b> paths in the early models of electronic switching systems. A miniature wire spring relay was also produced, starting in approximately 1974 as part of the 1A redesign of the 1ESS switch.|$|E

5000|$|Connection-oriented {{communication}} may be {{a circuit}} <b>switched</b> <b>connection,</b> or a packet-mode virtual circuit connection. In the latter case, it may use either a transport layer virtual circuit protocol such as the TCP protocol, allowing data to be delivered in order although the lower layer switching is connectionless, or it {{may be a}} data link layer or network layer switching mode, where all data packets belonging to the same traffic stream are delivered over the same path, and traffic flows are identified by some connection identifier rather than by complete routing information, allowing fast hardware based switching.|$|E
50|$|In electronics, {{a circuit}} is a path between {{two or more}} points along which an {{electrical}} current can be carried. (A circuit breaker is a device that interrupts the path when necessary to protect other devices attached to the circuit - for example, {{in case of a}} power surge.)  In telecommunications, a circuit is a discrete (specific) path between two or more points along which signals can be carried. Unless otherwise qualified, a circuit is a physical path, consisting of one or more wires (or wireless paths) and possibly intermediate switching points. A network is an arrangement of circuits. In a dial-up (<b>switched)</b> <b>connection,</b> a circuit is reserved for use by one user {{for the duration of the}} calling session. In a dedicated or leased line arrangement, a circuit is reserved in advance and can only be used by the owner or renter of the circuit.|$|E
50|$|ISDN is used heavily by the {{broadcast}} {{industry as a}} reliable way of switching low-latency, high-quality, long-distance audio circuits. In conjunction with an appropriate codec using MPEG or various manufacturers proprietary algorithms, an ISDN BRI {{can be used to}} send stereo bi-directional audio coded at 128 kbit/s with 20 Hz - 20 kHz audio bandwidth, although commonly the G.722 algorithm is used with a single 64 kbit/s B channel to send much lower latency mono audio at the expense of audio quality. Where very high quality audio is required multiple ISDN BRIs can be used in parallel to provide a higher bandwidth circuit <b>switched</b> <b>connection.</b> BBC Radio 3 commonly makes use of three ISDN BRIs to carry 320 kbit/s audio stream for live outside broadcasts. ISDN BRI services are used to link remote studios, sports grounds and outside broadcasts into the main broadcast studio. ISDN via satellite is used by field reporters around the world. It is also common to use ISDN for the return audio links to remote satellite broadcast vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a packet}} {{switched}} network, burst switching is a capability {{in which each}} network switch extracts routing instructions from an incoming packet header {{to establish and maintain}} the appropriate <b>switch</b> <b>connection</b> {{for the duration of the}} packet, following which the connection is automatically released.|$|R

This produces server to switch or <b>switch</b> to <b>switch</b> <b>connections</b> that are up to 8 times faster. In the past redundant links were unused due to Spanning Tree’s loop protection.|$|R

The included experimental results reflect its applicability in metropolitan environments...|$|E

The application circuit demonstrates current settling times between 7 [mu]s and 30 [mu]s at a switching frequency of 290 kHz.

40|$|Inverse Multiplexing for ATM (IMA) {{has been}} {{standardized}} by the ATM Forum {{to provide a}} high-capacity logical link by grouping several lower-capacity physical links. IMA is intrinsically point-to-point, assumes congestion-free links, and only tolerates relatively constant differential delays between the links. In this paper, we generalize the notion of inverse multiplexing by introducing switching and buffering within the inverse-multiplexed segment. The new scheme, which we call <b>Switched</b> <b>Connection</b> Inverse Multiplexing for ATM (SCIMA) allows to implement an N Θ N switch with ports operating at rate kR by using a kN Θ kN core ATM switch with ports of rate R. SCIMA executes demultiplexing on a selected set of virtual connections, dynamically distributes their traffic onto a group of switching paths, and performs egress re-assembly using an asynchronousmethod for differential delay compensation. The scheme is simple to implement, has low overhead, is robust in presence of cell [...] ...|$|E
40|$|As {{more and}} more traffic is transported over {{communication}} networks, network survivability becomes a key issue in network design and planning. In this paper first the need for deploying network recovery techniques at multiple layers is motivated. Then the efficient coordination of these network recovery techniques is studied. Not only static but also dynamic multi-layer survivability strategies are presented and studied in this paper: dynamic multi-layer survivability strategies benefit from {{the ability of the}} underlying transport network to provide <b>switched</b> <b>connection</b> services in order to allow reconfiguring the logical network at the time of a failure. As not only the traffic volume keeps growing, but also {{more and more}} services with distinct reliability requirements are deployed, the benefit of differentiating the multilayer survivability strategy per traffic class is investigated in this paper. Whereas the case studies in this paper focus on the cost-efficiency of the presented strategies and techniques, also a broader theoretic discussion is given on these techniques.

40|$|<b>Switched</b> <b>Connection</b> Inverse Multiplexing for ATM (SCIMA) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a low-overheadscheme for implementing an N Θ N switch with a port rate of kR using a kN core switch (or k N switches) having a port rate of R. By splitting the traffic of {{a small number of}} virtual connections into subconnections over multiple low-capacity core switch ports, SCIMA achieves a performance level comparable with that of an equivalent high-capacity port switch. The scheme ensures that each split cell flow is re-assembled and delivered in the original order even in the presence of variable differential delays and highly non-uniform switching path usage. Furthermore, it can seamlessly recover from isolated cell losses within the core switch, as well as detect the loss of a certain number of consecutive cells belonging to the same subconnection. However, it is unable to restore, by itself, the re-assembly cell chain after two or more consecutive cell losses occur in a row on the [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{world of}} {{telecommunications}} is currently {{going through a}} shift of paradigm from circuit <b>switched,</b> <b>connection</b> oriented information transfer towards packet switched, connection-less transfer. For application independence and to decrease costs for transport and switching it is attractive to go IP {{all the way over}} the air interface to the end user equipment, i. e., to not terminate the IP protocols before the air interface. A major reason to avoid using voice over IP over the air interface has, up to now, been the relatively large overhead imposed by the IP/UDP/RTP headers of voice packets. This paper presents a novel header compression scheme, ROCCO, that can compress the large headers to a minimum of one octet and is robust against the errors imposed by cellular links. Its performance is excellent both in terms of robustness and compression efficiency. Moreover, system capacity simulations are presented, which show that ROCCO gives significantly higher system capacity than the other current header compression candidate, CRTP. Finally it is argued that with ROCCO voice over IP over wireless becomes feasible from a spectrum-efficiency point of viewGodkänd; 2000; 20080328 (ysko...|$|E
40|$|The General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) {{has been}} {{developed}} for the mobile radio environment to allow the migration from the traditional circuit <b>switched</b> <b>connection</b> to a more efficient packet based communication link particularly for data transfer. GPRS requires the addition of not only the GPRS software protocol stack, but also more baseband functionality for the mobile as new coding schemes have be en defined, uplink status flag detection, multislot operation and dynamic coding scheme detect. This paper concentrates on evaluating {{the performance of the}} GPRS coding scheme detection methods {{in the presence of a}} multipath fading channel with a single co-channel interferer as a function of various soft-bit data widths. It has been found that compressing the soft-bit data widths from the output of the equalizer to save memory can influence the likelihood decision of the coding scheme detect function and hence contribute to the overall performance loss of the system. Coding scheme detection errors can therefore force the channel decoder to either select the incorrect decoding scheme or have no clear decision which coding scheme to use resulting in the decoded radio block failing the block check sequence and contribute to the block error rate. For correct performance simulation, the performance of the full coding scheme detection must be taken into account...|$|E
