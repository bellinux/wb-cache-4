40|$|The {{formation}} of haploid spores marks {{the initiation of}} the gametophytic phase {{of the life cycle}} of all vascular plants ranging from ferns to angiosperms. In angiosperms, this process is initiated by the differentiation of a subset of floral cells into sporocytes, which then undergo meiotic divisions to form microspores and megaspores. Currently, there is little information available regarding the genes and proteins that regulate this key step in plant reproduction. We report here the identification of a mutation, SPOROCYTELESS (SPL), which blocks <b>sporocyte</b> formation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Analysis of the SPL mutation suggests that development of the anther walls and the tapetum and microsporocyte formation are tightly coupled, and that nucellar development may be dependent on megasporocyte formation. Molecular cloning of the SPL gene showed that it encodes a novel nuclear protein related to MADS box transcription factors and that it is expressed during microsporogenesis and megasporogenesis. These data suggest that the SPL gene product is a transcriptional regulator of <b>sporocyte</b> development in Arabidopsis...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} marine protists have {{revealed}} parasites to be {{key components of}} marine communities. Here we describe a new species of the parasitoid genus Parvilucifera that was observed infecting the dinoflagellate Durinskia baltica in salt marshes of the Catalan coast (NW Mediterranean). In parallel, the same species was detected after the incubation of seawater from the Canary Islands (Lanzarote, NE Atlantic). The successful isolation of strains from both localities allowed description of the life cycle, ultrastructure, and phylogeny of the species. Its infection mechanism consists of a free-living zoospore that penetrates a dinoflagellate cell. The resulting trophont gradually degrades the dinoflagellate cytoplasm while growing in size. Once the host is consumed, schizogony of the parasitoid yields a <b>sporocyte.</b> After cytokinesis is complete, the newly formed zoospores are released into the environment and are ready to infect new host cells. A distinguishing feature of the species is the radial arrangement of its zoospores around the central area of the <b>sporocyte</b> during their formation.

40|$|Hybrids lose heterotic yield {{advantage}} when multiplied sexually via meiosis. A potential alternative breeding {{system for}} hybrids is apospory, where female gametes develop without meiosis. Common among grasses, apospory {{begins in the}} nucellus, where aposporous initials (AIs) appear near the sexual megaspore mother cell (MeMC). The cellular origin of AIs is obscure, but one possibility, suggested by the mac 1 and msp 1 mutants of maize and rice, is that AIs are apomeiotic derivatives of the additional MeMCs that appear when genetic control over <b>sporocyte</b> numbers is relaxed. MULTIPLE SPOROCYTES 1 (MSP 1) encodes a leucine-rich-repeat receptor kinase, which is orthologous to EXS/EMS 1 in Arabidopsis. Like mac 1 and msp 1, exs/ems 1 mutants produce extra sporocytes in the anther instead of a tapetum, causing male sterility. This phenotype is copied in mutants of TAPETUM DETERMINANT 1 (TPD 1), which encodes a small protein hypothesized to be an extracellular ligand of EXS/EMS 1. Here we show that rice contains two TPD 1 -like genes, OsTDL 1 A and OsTDL 1 B. Both are co-expressed with MSP 1 in anthers during meiosis, but only OsTDL 1 A and MSP 1 are co-expressed in the ovule. OsTDL 1 A binds to the leucine-rich-repeat domain of MSP 1 in yeast two-hybrid assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation in onion cells; OsTDL 1 B lacks this capacity. When driven by the maize Ubiquitin 1 promoter, RNA interference against OsTDL 1 A phenocopies msp 1 in the ovule {{but not in the}} anther. Thus, RNAi produces multiple MeMCs without causing male sterility. We conclude that OsTDL 1 A binds MSP 1 in order to limit <b>sporocyte</b> numbers.

40|$|Sporogenesis and spores of Equisetum bogotense (Equisetaceae) from {{mountain}} areas of Colombia. Studies on some reproductive traits in Equisetum species are scarce and valuable to understand species distribution. Therefore, a {{detailed study of}} the sporogenesis process and spore development in E. bogotense is presented, with {{an analysis of the}} main events during meiosis, maturation of spores, spore wall ultrastructure, orbicules and elaters. Specimens were collected from 500 to 4 500 m in Cauca, Colombia. Strobili at different maturation stages were fixed, dehydrated, embedded in resin, and ultra-microtome obtained sections were stained with Toluidine blue. Observations were made with optical microscopy with differential interference contrast illumination technique (DIC), transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM). Ultrathin sections (70 - 80 μm) for TEM observations were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate; while samples for SEM observations, were fixed, dehydrated in 2. 2 -dimethoxypropane and dried at critical point as in standard methods. Strobili have numerous mature sporangiophores, each one with a peltate structure, the scutellum, bearing five-six sessile sporangia attached to the axis of strobilus by the manubrium. Immature <b>sporocytes</b> (spore mother cells) are tightly packed within the young sporangia. The <b>sporocytes</b> quickly undergo meiosis, by passing the stage of archesporium and give origin to tetrads of spores. The tapetum loses histological integrity during early stages of sporogenesis, intrudes as a plasmodial mass into the cavity of the sporangium, partially surrounding premeiotic <b>sporocytes,</b> and then, tetrads and adult spores. The tapetum disintegrates {{towards the end of the}} sporogenesis, leaving spores free within the sporangial cavity. Spores present several cytological changes that allow them to achieve greater size and increase the number of plastids, before reaching the adult stage. Sporoderm includes three layers external to the cytoplasmic membrane of the spore cell, and they are pseudoendospore, exospore and perispore. Viewed with SEM, the exospore is smooth to rugulate, with micro perforations, while the perispore is muriform, rugate, with narrow, delicate, discontinuous, randomly distributed folds delimiting incomplete, irregular areolae, externally covered by of different size, densely distributed orbicules. These orbicules are also found all over the external face and margins of the elaters, while the internal face is smooth and lack orbicules. Viewed with TEM, the exospore is a thick layer of fine granular material, while perispore is a thinner layer of dense, separate orbicules. The elaters are composed by two layers of fibrillar material: an inner layer with longitudinally oriented fibrils and an outer, thicker and less dense layer with fibrils transversely fibrils and abundant, external orbicules. It is suggested that the processes of ontogeny and characters of the sporoderm are relatively constant in Equisetum; however, sporogenesis in E. bogotense is synchronous and this condition has been observed so far only in E. giganteum, a tropical genus also found in Colombia.

40|$|The {{function}} of the novel gene MSP 1 (MULTIPLE <b>SPOROCYTE),</b> which controls early sporogenic development, was elucidated by characterizing a retrotransposon-tagged mutation of rice. The MSP 1 gene encoded a Leu-rich repeat receptor–like protein kinase. The msp 1 mutation gave rise to an excessive number of {{both male and female}} sporocytes. In addition, the formation of anther wall layers was disordered and the tapetum layer was lost completely. Although the mutation never affected homologous chromosome pairing and chiasma maintenance, the development of pollen mother cells was arrested at various stages of meiotic prophase I, which resulted in complete male sterility. Meanwhile, plural megaspore mother cells in a mutant ovule generated several megaspores, underwent gametogenesis, and produced germinable seeds when fertilized with wild-type pollen despite disorganized female gametophytes. In situ expression of MSP 1 was detected in surrounding cells of male and female sporocytes and some flower tissues, but never in the sporocytes themselves. These results suggest that the MSP 1 product plays crucial roles in restricting the number of cells entering into male and female sporogenesis and in initiating anther wall formation in rice...|$|E
40|$|Studies on {{reproductive}} {{aspects of}} Lycopodiaceae {{are not very}} abundant in the scientific literature, and constitute essential information to support taxonomic and systematic relationships among the group. 							Here we present a detailed study of the ontogeny of sporangia and sporogenesis, and the chemical determination of several compounds generated during spore formation. The analyses were performed in 14 taxa of six genera of the family, Diphasiastrum, Diphasium, Huperzia (a genus which is treated here including Phlegmariurus), Lycopodiella, Lycopodium and Palhinhaea. Specimens were collected in three departments from the Colombian Andes between 1 454 - 3 677 m altitude. Ontogeny was studied in small, 1 cm long pieces of strobili and axis, which were fixed in glutaraldehyde or FAA, dehydrated in alcohol, embedded in LR White, sectioned in 0. 2 - 0. 5 μm and stained with toluidine blue (TBO), a metachromatic dye that allows to detect both sporopollenin and lignin or its precursors, during these processes. For other studies, paraplast plus-embedded sections (3 - 5 μm) were stained with safranin-fast green and alcian blue-hematoxylin. Chemical tests were also conducted in sections of fresh sporangia {{at different stages of}} maturity using alcian blue (mucopolysaccharides), Lugol solution (starch), Sudan III (lipids), phloroglucinol (lignin) and orcein (chromosomes). Sections were observed with photonic microscope equipped with differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescence microscopy (for spore and sporangium walls unstained). Strobili and sporangia were dehydrated with 2. 2 dimethoxypropane, critical point dried and coated with gold for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our results indicated that the ontogeny of sporangia and sporogenesis were very similar to the previously observed in Huperzia brevifolia. 							Cutinisation occurs in early stages of development of sporangium cell walls, but in their final stages walls become lignified. As for the sporoderm development, the exospore is the first layer formed, composed by sporopollenin. The endospore deposits as a thin inner layer composed of cellulose, pectin and carboxylated polysaccharides. The perispore, if present, deposits at last. Mucopolysaccharides were found on the <b>sporocyte</b> coat and its abundance in sporangial cavity persists up to the immature tetrads stage, and then disappears. The lipids were abundant in the sporocytes, tetrads and spores, representing the main source of energy of the latter. 							In contrast, starch is not detected in the spores, but is abundant in premeiotic sporocytes and immature tetrads, developmental stages of high cellular metabolic activity. Intrinsic fluorescence corroborates the presence of lignin and cutin in the sporangium wall, while the sporopollenin is restricted to the exospore. The transfusion cells and the perispore are not always present. However, the processes of ontogeny and sporogenesis are extremely similar throughout the taxa studied, suggesting that they represent conservative family traits, nonspecific or generic.

40|$|It {{has already}} been {{experimentally}} confirmed by many investigators that schistosoma miracidia hatched out {{in the water and}} invaded into the oncomelania snails through their body surface and developed up to cercaria in the snail tissues within about eleven weeks. Oncomelania snail is, however, ordinarily a kind of land-inhabiting snails which spend great part of their life time on the ground. Therefore, attack of schistosoma miracidia to the snail may be limited in an exclusive oppotunity of being submerged in the water by raining or irrigation. Miyagawa (1916) and Suzuki (1913) described an evidence that hatching process of schistosoma egg was inhibited in fecal substances of the host. There is no any reason to deny a possibility that the snail contact with unhatched schistosoma eggs on the ground in natural world. The author attempt an experiment to give orally Schistosoma japonicum eggs to the snail, Oncomelania nosophora, Yamanashi strain, and to follow up its migration and development in the snail tissues. First of all in this study, viability and hatchability of the eggs were tested under various conditions of media in which the eggs were incubated. As the results, it was demonstrated that distilled water of pH 7. 6 was the most ideal medium for hatching of the eggs, but saline and succarose solution were not suitable for maintaining of the viability. On the other hand, the author pointed out an important and interesting fact that S. japonicum eggs placed on an agar plate which was kept in high moisture and constant temperature of 27 ℃ to 29 ℃ did not hatch throughout the period of ten days investigation and most of them could suvive for long time at least three days. The snails and eggs containing mature miracidia were placed together on the agar plate mentioned above for 15 minutes to 2 hours to bring them into contact each other. After this procedure the snails were isolated on filter paper disk and fed with rice powder. Number of the eggs remaining on the agar plate were counted. The snails were killed and histologically examined at designated intervals after the infection. The eggs were found to reduce in number which varied from seven to eighteen eggs per snail. In the histological examination of the snail, the eggs were first detected in the esophagus and stomach shortly after ingestion and then in the intestine and rectum within 4 hours. 12 to 48 hours the empty egg shell and hatched miracidia were found, some of which were going to penetrate into the wall of digestive canal or submucous connective tissues. Other miracidia were found, furthermore, to migrate into the liver, kidney and uterine. These invasion of miracidia produced sometimes infiltration of a small lymphocyte like cell and amoebocyte, and granuloma bilding around degenerated miracidia in the snail tissues. However, the author has never found any other larval forms of further developed stages, such as typical <b>sporocyte</b> and cercaria during the period of observation over 11 weeks. 著者は日本住血吸虫の中間宿主宮入貝O. nosophoraの感染経路に関する研究の一端として,日本住血吸虫卵を宮入貝に経口的に与え貝体内での虫卵の移行,発育を観察した. 先ず色々のmedium日虫卵の生存と孵化に及ぼす影響を観察したが,その至適な水はpH 7. 6 ～ 6. 8 の蒸溜水である. アルカリに傾いた蒸溜水,食塩水,ブドー糖液では孵化が抑制されるが,濃度が高くなると同時に虫卵の生存に障害的に作用し,孵化能力を失う. 日虫卵を寒天板に置く事によって虫卵は孵化せず,少くとも 3 日間生きたまゝ保存する事が出来る. 甲府産の宮入貝を寒天上で日虫卵と接触させると好んで捕喰する. 虫卵は食道,胃,小腸,直腸と下降し, 12 時間頃から消化管内で孵化し, 48 時間頃になると一部は繊毛を失なって消化管壁,中腸腺,腎腔その他の組織に侵入,胚細胞の分裂が見られる. その後 77 日まで観察したが,スポロチスト,セルカリアに発育したものは検出出来なかった...|$|E

Here we describe the ontogeny of the strobilus and sporangia, {{and the process of}} sporogenesis using specimens of E. giganteum from Colombia collected along the Rio Frio, Distrito de Sevilla, Piedecuesta, Santander, at 2 200 m altitude. The strobili in different stages of development were fixed, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, sectioned using a rotatory microtome and stained with the safranin O and fast green technique. Observations were made using differential interference contrast microscopy (DIC) or Nomarski microscopy, an optical microscopy illumination technique that enhances the contrast in unstained, transparent. Strobili arise and begin to develop in the apical meristems of the main axis and lateral branches, with no significant differences in the ontogeny of strobili of one or other axis. Successive processes of cell division and differentiation lead to the growth of the strobilus and the formation of sporangiophores. These are formed by the scutellum, the manubrium or pedicel-like, basal part of the sporangiophore, and initial cells of sporangium, which differentiate to form the sporangium wall, the <b>sporocytes</b> and the tapetum. There is not formation of a characteristic arquesporium, as <b>sporocytes</b> quickly undergo meiosis originating tetrads of spores. The tapetum retains its histological integrity, but subsequently the cell walls break down and form a plasmodium that invades the sporangial cavity, partially surrounding the tetrads, and then the spores. Towards the end of the sporogenesis the tapetum disintegrates leaving spores with elaters free within the sporangial cavity. Two layers finally form the sporangium wall: the sporangium wall itself, with thickened, lignified cell walls and an underlying pyknotic layer. The mature spores are chlorofilous, morphologically similar and have exospore, a thin perispore and two elaters. This study of the ontogeny of the spore-producing structures and spores is the first contribution of this type for a tropical species of the genus. Fluorescence microscopy indicates that elaters and the wall of the sporangium are autofluorescent, while other structures induced fluorescence emitted by the fluorescent dye safranin O. The results were also discussed in relation to what is known so far for other species of Equisetum, suggesting that ontogenetic processes and structure of characters sporoderm are relatively constant in Equisetum, which implies important diagnostic value in the taxonomy of the group.

40|$|Blastodinium is a genus of {{dinoflagellates}} {{that live}} as parasites {{in the gut}} of marine, planktonic copepods in the World’s oceans and coastal waters. The taxonomy, phylogeny and physiology of the genus has only been explored to a limited degree and, based on recent investigations, we hypothesize that the morphological and genetic diversity within this genus may be considerably larger than presently recognized. To address these issues, we obtained 18 S rDNA and ITS gene sequences for Blastodinium specimens of different geographical origins, including representatives of the type species. This genetic information was in some cases complemented with new morphological, ultrastructural, physiological and ecological data. Because most current knowledge about Blastodinium {{and its effects on}} copepod hosts stem from publications {{more than half a century}} old, we here summarize and discuss the existing knowledge in relation to the new data generated. Most Blastodinium species possess functional chloroplasts, but the parasitic stage, the trophocyte, has etioplasts and probably a limited photosynthetic activity. <b>Sporocytes</b> and swarmer cells have well developed plastids and plausibly acquire part of their organic carbon needs through photosynthesis. A few species are nearly colourless with no functional chloroplasts. The photosynthetic species are almost exclusively found in warm, oligotrophic waters, indicating a life strategy that may benefit from copepods as microhabitats for acquiring nutrients in a nutrient-limited environment. As reported in the literature, monophyly of the genus is moderately supported, but the three main groups proposed by Chatton in 1920 are consistent with molecular data. However, we demonstrate an important genetic diversity within the genus and present evidences for new groups and the presence of cryptic species. Finally, we discuss the current knowledge on the occurrence of Blastodinium spp. and their potential impact on natural copepod populations...|$|R
40|$|The SeedGenes {{database}} (www. seedgenes. org) contains {{information on}} more than 400 genes required for embryo development in Arabidopsis. Many of these EMBRYO-DEFECTIVE (EMB) genes encode proteins with an essential function required throughout the life cycle. This raises a fundamental question. Why does elimination of an essential gene in Arabidopsis often result in embryo lethality rather than gametophyte lethality? In other words, how do mutant (emb) gametophytes survive and participate in fertilization when an essential cellular function is disrupted? Furthermore, why do some mutant embryos proceed further in development than others? To address these questions, we first established a curated dataset of genes required for gametophyte development in Arabidopsis based on information extracted from the literature. This provided a basis for comparison with EMB genes obtained from the SeedGenes dataset. We also identified genes that exhibited both embryo and gametophyte defects when disrupted by a loss-of-function mutation. We then evaluated the relationship between mutant phenotype, gene redundancy, mutant allele strength, gene expression pattern, protein function, and intracellular protein localization to determine what factors influence the phenotypes of lethal mutants in Arabidopsis. After removing cases where continued development potentially resulted from gene redundancy or residual function of a weak mutant allele, we identified numerous examples of viable mutant (emb) gametophytes that required further explanation. We propose {{that the presence of}} gene products derived from transcription in diploid (heterozygous) <b>sporocytes</b> often enables mutant gametophytes to survive the loss of an essential gene in Arabidopsis. Whether gene disruption results in embryo or gametophyte lethality therefore depends in part on the ability of residual, parental gene products to support gametophyte development. We also highlight here 70 preglobular embryo mutants with a zygotic pattern of inheritance, which provide valuable insights into the maternal-to-zygotic transition in Arabidopsis and the timing of paternal gene activation during embryo development...|$|R
40|$|Blastodinium are chloroplast-containing {{dinoflagellates}} which infect a {{wide range}} of copepods. They develop inside the gut of their host, where they produce successive generations of <b>sporocytes</b> that are eventually expelled through the anus of the copepod. Here, we report on copepod infections in the oligotrophic to ultra-oligotrophic waters of the Mediterranean Sea sampled during the BOUM cruise. Based on a DNA-stain screening of gut contents, 16 % of copepods were possibly infected in samples from the Eastern Mediterranean infected, with up to 51 % of Corycaeidae, 33 % of Calanoida, but less than 2 % of Oithonidae and Oncaeidae. Parasites were classified into distinct morphotypes, with some tentatively assigned to species B. mangini, B. contortum, and B. cf. spinulosum. Based upon the SSU rDNA gene sequence analyses of 15 individuals, the genus Blastodinium was found to be polyphyletic, containing at least three independent clusters. The first cluster grouped all sequences retrieved from parasites of Corycaeidae and Oncaeidae during this study, and included sequences of Blastodinium mangini (the "mangini" cluster). Sequences from cells infecting Calanoida belonged to two different clusters, one including B. contortum (the "contortum" cluster), and the other uniting all B. spinulosum -like morphotypes (the "spinulosum" cluster). Cluster-specific oligonucleotidic probes were designed and tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in order to assess the distribution of dinospores, the Blastodinium dispersal and infecting stage. Probe-positive cells were all small thecate dinoflagellates, with lengths ranging from 7 to 18 μm. Maximal abundances of Blastodinium dinospores were detected at the Deep Chlorophyll Maximum (DCM) or slightly below. This was in contrast to distributions of autotrophic pico- and nanoplankton, microplanktonic dinoflagellates, and nauplii which showed maximal concentrations above the DCM. The distinct distribution of dinospores and nauplii argues against infection during the naupliar stage. Dinospores, described as autotrophic in the literature, may escape the severe nutrient limitation of ultra-oligotrophic ecosystems by living inside copepods...|$|R
40|$|Estudios sobre la ontogenia del estróbilo, los esporangios y la biología reproductiva de Equisetum son escasos, por lo tanto, para la especie E. giganteum, se estudiaron estos aspectos en especímenes recolectados a orillas del Río Frío, Santander, Colombia (2 200 m). Los estróbilos en diferentes etapas de maduración fueron fijados, deshidratados, embebidos en parafina, seccionados en micrótomo rotatorio y teñidos con safranina O-fast green. Las observaciones se efectuaron mediante un microscopio óptico de alta resolución con contraste diferencial de interferencia (DIC) y microscopio de fluorescencia. Los estróbilos se inician a partir del meristemo apical, tanto en el eje {{principal}} como en los laterales, sin diferencias en el proceso de ontogenia y esporogénesis entre estróbilos de diferentes ejes. Sucesivas mitosis y diferenciación celular conducen al crecimiento del estróbilo, y a la formación de los esporangióforos peltados, formados por el manubrio, o porción basal con aspecto de pedicelo, el escutelo, o porción apical aplanada y las iniciales del esporangio, los cuales se diferenciarán para formar la pared del esporangio, los esporocitos y el tapete. No se forma arquesporio y los esporocitos experimentan meiosis para formar tétradas de esporas. El tapete mantiene la integridad histológica hasta la formación de las tétradas y en esa etapa forma un plasmodio que invade la cavidad esporangial la cual rodea parcialmente las tétradas y luego las esporas, y aparecen las cámaras plasmodiales, un término propuesto aquí para las formaciones designadas en inglés "tapetal gaps". La pared del esporangio queda reducida a dos capas celulares: una externa con engrosamientos lignificados en todas las paredes celulares y una interna picnótica. Al finalizar la esporogénesis, el tapete degenera, y las esporas, con exosporio, perisporio delgado, casi membranáceo y eláteres quedan libres en la cavidad esporangial. El esporodermo, los núcleos y nucléolos presentan fluorescencia roja, inducida por coloración con safranina O, mientras que los eláteres y las células de la pared del esporangio presentan autofluorescencia amarillo-naranja. Ontogeny of strobili, sporangia {{development and}} sporogenesis in Equisetum giganteum (Equisetaceae) from the Colombian Andes. Studies on the ontogeny of the strobilus, sporangium and reproductive biology {{of this group}} of ferns are scarce. Here we describe the ontogeny of the strobilus and sporangia, {{and the process of}} sporogenesis using specimens of E. giganteum from Colombia collected along the Rio Frio, Distrito de Sevilla, Piedecuesta, Santander, at 2 200 m altitude. The strobili in different stages of development were fixed, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, sectioned using a rotatory microtome and stained with the safranin O and fast green technique. Observations were made using differential interference contrast microscopy (DIC) or Nomarski microscopy, an optical microscopy illumination technique that enhances the contrast in unstained, transparent. Strobili arise and begin to develop in the apical meristems of the main axis and lateral branches, with no significant differences in the ontogeny of strobili of one or other axis. Successive processes of cell division and differentiation lead to the growth of the strobilus and the formation of sporangiophores. These are formed by the scutellum, the manubrium or pedicel-like, basal part of the sporangiophore, and initial cells of sporangium, which differentiate to form the sporangium wall, the <b>sporocytes</b> and the tapetum. There is not formation of a characteristic arquesporium, as <b>sporocytes</b> quickly undergo meiosis originating tetrads of spores. The tapetum retains its histological integrity, but subsequently the cell walls break down and form a plasmodium that invades the sporangial cavity, partially surrounding the tetrads, and then the spores. Towards the end of the sporogenesis the tapetum disintegrates leaving spores with elaters free within the sporangial cavity. Two layers finally form the sporangium wall: the sporangium wall itself, with thickened, lignified cell walls and an underlying pyknotic layer. The mature spores are chlorofilous, morphologically similar and have exospore, a thin perispore and two elaters. This study of the ontogeny of the spore-producing structures and spores is the first contribution of this type for a tropical species of the genus. Fluorescence microscopy indicates that elaters and the wall of the sporangium are autofluorescent, while other structures induced fluorescence emitted by the fluorescent dye safranin O. The results were also discussed in relation to what is known so far for other species of Equisetum, suggesting that ontogenetic processes and structure of characters sporoderm are relatively constant in Equisetum, which implies important diagnostic value in the taxonomy of the group.

40|$|Se {{describe}} la ontogenia y la esporogénesis en H. brevifolia, en material recolectado en el Parque Nacional Natural El Cocuy (Boyacá-Colombia) a 4200 m de altitud. Los esporangios se desarrollan de forma basípeta sobre el eje caulinar: los iniciales y juveniles se localizan en el ápice y los adultos a maduros, en la base. El desarrollo se inicia a partir de un grupo de células epidérmicas localizadas en las axilas que forman los microfilos con el eje caulinar. Estas células se dividen activamente por mitosis formando una masa celular externa y otra interna. La primera da origen a la pared del esporangio, de varios estratos celulares; de éstos, el estrato externo desarrolla engrosamientos en las paredes anticlinales y en la periclinal interna. El estrato celular interno se diferencia para formar el tapete secretor. Los demás estratos celulares de la pared se degradan durante la maduración del esporangio. La masa celular interna da origen al tejido esporógeno que forma los esporocitos, que experimentan la meiosis I hasta la etapa de díada. La meiosis II concluye con la formación de tétradas, constituidas por esporas en disposición tetraédrica. Las esporas son foveoladas con abertura trilete y son liberadas del esporangio a través de la dehiscencia. Sporangia ontogeny and sporogenesis of the lycopodium Huperzia brevifolia (Lycopodiaceae) {{from the}} high mountains of Colombia. Huperzia brevifolia {{is one of the}} dominant species of the genus Huperzia living in paramos and superparamos from the Colombian Andes. A detailed study of the sporangium’s ontogeny and sporogenesis was carried out using specimens collected at 4200 m above sea level, in Parque Natural Nacional El Cocuy, Colombia. Small pieces of caulinar axis bearing sporangia were fixed, dehydrated, paraffin embedded, sectioned in a rotatory microtome, and stained using the common Safranin O-Fast Green technique; handmade cross sections were also made, stained with aqueous Toluidine Blue (TBO). The sporangia develops basipetally, a condition that allows observation of all the developmental stages taking place throughout the caulinar axis of adult plants. Each sporangium originates from a group of epidermal cells, axilar to the microphylls. These cells undergo active mitosis, and produce new external and internal cellular groups. The sporangium wall and the tapetum originate from the external group of cells, while the internal cellular group leads to the sporogenous tissue. Meiosis occur in the <b>sporocytes</b> and produce simultaneous types tetrads, each one giving rise four trilete spores, with foveolate ornamentation. During the sporangium ripening, the outermost layer of the wall develops anticlinally, and inner periclinal thickenings and the innermost one perform as a secretory tapetum, which persists until the spores are completely mature. All other cellular layers colapse. Rev. Biol. Trop. 57 (4) : 1141 - 1152. Epub 2009 December 01...|$|R
