40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{have reported}} that some gas-rich dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies appear to have spherical distributions in the outer underlying old and intermediate-age stellar populations (e. g., NGC 6822). These observations imply that some dIrr’s have two distinct (or “two-component”) structures, i. e., inner disky and <b>outer</b> <b>spherical</b> ones, though the number fraction of dIrr’s with such structures remains observationally unclear. We discuss how such two distinct structures are formed during dIrr formation based on observations and simulations. Our numerical simulations show that the remnants of mergers between two gas-rich dIrr’s with initially extended gas disks can have both extended spheroids composed of older stellar populations and disks composed mostly of gas and young stars. The simulated remnants with two distinct structures can be still identified as dIrr’s owing {{to the presence of}} star-forming regions. The structural properties of <b>outer</b> <b>spherical</b> structures in dIrr’s formed from dIrr-dIrr merging depend on initial conditions of merging, which suggests that outer structures in dIrr’s can be diverse. We also discuss other possible physical mechanisms for the formation of <b>outer</b> <b>spherical</b> structures composed of older stars in dIrr’s...|$|R

40|$|The {{calculation}} of multivariate normal probabilities {{is of great}} importance in many statistical and economic applications. This paper proposes a spherical Monte Carlo method with both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. First, the multivariate normal probability is rewritten via an inner radial integral and an <b>outer</b> <b>spherical</b> integral by the spherical transformation. For the <b>outer</b> <b>spherical</b> integral, we apply an integration rule by randomly rotating a predetermined set of well-located points. To find the desired set, we derive an upper bound for the variance of the Monte Carlo estimator and propose a set which {{is related to the}} kissing number problem in sphere packings. For the inner radial integral, we employ the idea of antithetic variates and identify certain conditions so that variance reduction is guaranteed. Extensive Monte Carlo experiments on some probabilities calculation confirm these claims...|$|R

40|$|We perform {{numerical}} simulations for {{the formation}} of the Galactic stellar halo, based on the currently favored cold dark matter (CDM) theory of galaxy formation. Our numerical models, taking into account both dynamical and chemical evolution processes in a consistent manner, are aimed at explaining observed structure and kinematics of the stellar halo in the context of hierarchical galaxy formation. The main results of the present simulations are summarized as follows. (1) Basic physical processes involved {{in the formation of the}} stellar halo, composed of metal-deficient stars with [Fe/H] 1). (2) The simulated halo has the density profile similar to the observed power-law form of ρ (r) ∼ r^- 3. 5, and has also the similar metallicity distribution to the observations. The halo virtually shows no radial gradient for stellar ages and only small gradient for metallicities. (3) The dual nature of the halo, i. e., its inner flattened and <b>outer</b> <b>spherical</b> density distribution, is reproduced, at least qualitatively, by the present model. The <b>outer</b> <b>spherical</b> halo is formed via essentially dissipationless merging of small subgalactic clumps, whereas the inner flattened one is formed via three different mechanisms, i. e., dissipative merging between larger, more massive clumps, adiabatic contraction due to the growing Galactic disk, and gaseous accretion onto the equatorial plane.
