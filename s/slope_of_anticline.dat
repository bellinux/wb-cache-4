5000|$|This {{specific}} {{meaning for}} [...] "lower plain" [...] derive from a geologic feature called the fontanili ("spring") line or zone, {{a band of}} springs around the Val Po, heaviest on the north, on the lowermost <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> the <b>anticline.</b> It varies from a few kilometres {{to as much as}} 50 km wide. The fontanili line is the outcrop, or intersection, <b>of</b> the <b>anticline's</b> water table with the surface {{at the edge of the}} bassa. The rock above the line is porous. Surface water in the intermittent streams of the mountains tends to disappear below ground only to spring out again in the spring zone. The spring zone is often called [...] "the middle valley." ...|$|R
5000|$|The exposed rock of the River Knobs {{is a tough}} quartzite, Tuscarora Sandstone, an {{extremely}} hard sedimentary rock, ranging in color from a nearly translucent white, to gray, pink or orange. Laid down as sediment on a sea floor 440 million years ago, in West Virginia the Tuscarora is 150 to 250 ft thick. At the River Knobs, the quartzite layer has been [...] "verticalized" [...] by geological forces during {{the formation of the}} Appalachians some 230 million years ago. A folding of the Earth's crust forced this layer - and the surrounding strata - into enormous arches, miles wide. The River Knobs trace the western wall of this arch, or anticline, where the Tuscarora was turned a full 90 degrees from horizontal to vertical. Over time, erosion stripped away the softer rock covering the arch, and finally the dome of the arch itself. The tough quartzite of the western walls resisted this process, leaving the soaring [...] "fins" [...] - narrow vertical plates of exposed rock. About 2 mi east, along the top of North Fork Mountain, the horizontal strata <b>of</b> the far <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the Tuscarora <b>anticline</b> are also visible. (Within this eroded anticline lies Germany Valley, registered as a National Natural Landmark because of its unique karst topography.) ...|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Cenozoic era and the early Alpine tectonic cycle, large anticlines, or folds were being formed in the Balkan Mountains, and during this time the region turned to dry land.

40|$|During the Miocene, {{hydrocarbon}} seep-carbonates located atop intrabasinal {{highs and}} associated with sediment instability, formed commonly at the deformation {{front of the}} Northern Apennine collisional orogen. The parallelism between the structural trend {{and the distribution of}} seep-carbonates suggests a close relationship between tectonics and gas/fluid emission. The “Montepetra intrabasinal high” was formed during the closure stage of the foredeep, being related to the synsedimentary growth <b>of</b> an <b>anticline.</b> Field geometry suggests that detachment folding was the leading mechanism <b>of</b> <b>anticline</b> growth and synsedimentary instability along the anticline flanks. Ten different bodies of seep-carbonates occur in the Tortonian-early Messinian sediments: nine in the hinge zone and one in the southern backlimb <b>of</b> the <b>anticline.</b> Foraminiferal study, geochemistry, facies investigation and the three-dimensional geometry of carbonate bodies with respect to the encasing terrigenous sediments indicate a protracted (late Tortonian-early Messinian) activity of fluid migration with re-mobilization and ascent of sediments from the core <b>of</b> the <b>anticline,</b> stabilization <b>of</b> chemosynthesis-related communities, and in-situ brecciation. Seepage atop the intrabasinal high was fed by different circuits: one related to the compaction-dewatering of shallow (Tortonian-early Messinian) sediments, and a deeper one related to the deformation <b>of</b> the <b>anticline</b> core and to the activity of detachment surfaces and of faults propagating through the sedimentary cover...|$|R

30|$|For many years, {{this type}} of study was {{practically}} {{the only source of}} information on which exploratory efforts were based, and was even utilized in order to select the most favorable drilling sites. In the case <b>of</b> <b>anticline</b> folds discernible on the surface, many successful wells were drilled in the USA, solely based on the observation <b>of</b> exposed <b>anticline</b> tops. Until well into the twentieth century, these observations were preponderant in guiding exploratory efforts (Hoswell 1934). Other empirically guided exploratory methods were also successfully employed, such as “creekology,” or the drilling of successive wells along a riverbed or creek. If the first well was successful, subsequent wells drilled along the same creek had, in fact, a greater chance of being successful. Even without the understanding that we now have, regarding the geological processes that occur underground, many of those wells drilled followed the tops <b>of</b> <b>anticlines.</b> Those structures weakened surface rocks and facilitated their erosion, thus forming preferential channels for surface water flows. When drilling along such formations, those explorationists were unwittingly selecting the most favorable locations for hydrocarbon accumulations in the subsurface, and, not surprisingly, achieving greater success (Frehner 2004).|$|R

Therefore, it has formed a unique exposure for above formations. In order to this situation, folding mechanism <b>of</b> Asmari <b>anticline</b> has investigated in this research. According to our results, Asmari anticline has two mechanisms: flexural-slip in post-Cretaceous sequences (Kha-mi-Quaternary) and fault-bend folding in pre-Cretaceous sequences.

The approach presented here involves analysis of topography and drainage incision of selected landforms to detect growth <b>of</b> active <b>anticlines</b> and transfer faults. Landforms that indicate active folding above a southwest-dipping frontal thrust and a northeastdipping back-thrust are described.

40|$|Marun {{oilfield}} {{is located}} in the middle part of Dezful Embayment and is situated along the Aghajari, Ahvaz and Ramin anticline. Given the important role of fracture characteristics for improving production, so the aim of this research is to investigate the density pattern of fracture in Asmari formation in Marun oilfield. For this purpose, results of image log, core data, graphic well log, methods of inscribed circle analysis and curvature changes geometry <b>of</b> <b>anticline</b> were analyzed. Asmari formation is the main reservoir rock in Marun oilfield that divided into five zones. Limestone and dolomite are the main lithology of zones 1, 2 and 3 which has a high density of fractures (especially in zones with 90 % dolomite). Also there is less fracture density (micro fracture) in the 4 and 5 Asmari zone due to an increase of shale and marl layers and due to less break ablity has a less distribution of fractures. The result show that there are a good conformity existed between the results of inscribed circle analysis, image log, core data, curvature and the presence of fractures in Marun anticline. The data indicate that highest density of fracture density concentrates in the southern limb in the central region <b>of</b> <b>anticline</b> and also in the north limb in the northeast region <b>of</b> the <b>anticline.</b> So, finally using these parameters, it is recommended that further development and production wells be drilled in the north eastern part of the oil filed as well as center part of southern flank <b>of</b> the <b>anticline...</b>|$|R
