40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{process has}} been {{developed}} in our laboratories in which the reinforce-ment of engineering thermoplastics is generated during melt processing. The process con-sists of blending thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers with engineering thermoplastics in an extruder. On extruding these blends through a <b>sheet</b> <b>die,</b> films (or sheet) are formed in which the LCP phase exists {{in the form of}} thin fibrils. The formation of fibrils depends on the presence of certain hydrodynamic conditions defined by the viscosity ratio, capil-lary number, and flow type. The sheets are then drawn to impart molecular orientation in the LCP phase. Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) sheets reinforced with several different LCP’s have been formed in which the properties are significantly enhanced. The modulus of these sheets represented almost a fourfold increase over that of the pure PPS sheet. The dynamic torsional properties of the sheet are also determined using a Rheometrics Mechanical Spectrometer and results are correlated with the structure and molecular ori-entation...|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. The {{addition}} of lignocellulosic fibres to thermoplastic polymers {{is known to}} increase the toughness of the polymers but it compromises the tensile strength. On the other hand, inorganic fillers like TiO 2 are known to improve the tensile strength of polymers. These plant fibres {{have been used as}} adsorbents of metal pollutants in water. Best results were obtained when such materials were ground to fine powder but due to low density, the fibres float and form aggregates in water. Being highly biodegradable in nature makes plant fibres unsuitable for water treatment over lengthy periods of time. They cannot be used as standalone materials. Mixing these adsorbents with polymers, which cannot only act as support for the adsorbents but also disperse the fibres within it thus preventing leaching, is a cause for concern. This study was aimed at fabricating plant fibre-polymer composites that will have improved mechanical and thermal properties. These composites were to be tested for their ability to be used as metal ion adsorbents. The composites were fabricated using a melt-mix compounding method. Two thermoplastic polymers, EVA and PCL were each mixed with either lignin or SCB and TiO 2 in different ratios. A rheomex mixer coupled with a single screw extruder which was attached to a <b>sheet</b> <b>die</b> was used to synthesise the composites. TGA and DSC were used for thermal propagation while the mechanical properties were investigated using an instron. Metal ion adsorption measurements were analysed using an atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS). These adsorbents were used to remove Cr(VI), Cr(III) and Pb(II), varying different environmental parameters like pH, concentration, time and adsorbent at constant temperature. The reinforcing effect of both lignin and SCB resulted to poor thermal and mechanical properties. This was shown by a decrease in onset degradation temperature and the tensile and toughness of the composites compared to the neat polymers. The incorporation of TiO 2 on SCB-EVA composites, however, improved the mechanical strength and resulted in a thermally stable composite compared to counterpart composites without TiO 2. This observation was surpassed at high filler loading as the {{addition of}} TiO 2 resulted in a decrease of the properties. For the tensile strength, neat EVA recorded 11. 35 MPa while 2 % TiO 2 -EVA registered 12. 49 MPa for example. For the same composite, the onset degradation temperature for EVA was 353 oC but shifted to 368 oC after the addition of TiO 2. At higher filler loading, no effect was observed when adding TiO 2...|$|E

40|$|In {{a postmodern}} world where mass {{customization}} of products {{is a key}} driver of modern manufacturing systems design, the quick and accurate shaping of metallic shapes has acquired significant importance in key frontiers of technological developments. While additive manufacturing techniques have bridged the gap in terms of rapid manufacture of certain products, the possibility of flexible and rapid manufacture of sheet metal products {{on the other hand}} has been supported by the developments in incremental sheet deformation techniques. Specifically, single point incremental sheet forming or SPIF has come forward as a potential industrial technology of the future that can help shape sheet metal {{with the help of a}} tool and without any supporting dies, that can deform a sheet incrementally by following a defined toolpath. This toolpath, in turn, can be generated with a CAD/CAM software, for a given part geometry. The single point incremental sheet forming process comes with a number of limitations, which hinder its implementation in industry. Specifically, the process was characterized by material and process parameter specific forming limits and low accuracy at the outset of this research. The existing state of the art in incremental forming proposed a feature-based accuracy improvement system based on a broad classification of part features into planes, ruled features, freeform features and ribs. However, such a classification was not refined enough to produce accurate parts consistently and within specified tolerances. To overcome low forming limits, a laser-based dynamic heating system is available. Besides, formability can be improved by using multi-step toolpaths where a part is formed in steps starting with a part with wall angles lower than the final part and increasing the wall angles in subsequent steps. While both techniques result in improved formability, there are certain drawbacks in these techniques which need to be overcome. While the dynamic heating system can extend forming limits of specific materials, multi-step toolpaths can lead to high processing times, and non-uniform bottom surfaces. In this research, steps were taken to improve upon the existing state of the art in the incremental sheet forming process using an experimental campaign on study of behavior of part features, in-process digital image correlation (DIC) studies and developing advanced process planning tools for generating optimized toolpaths that helped improve upon the drawbacks existing at the start of the research. Specifically, to improve on the accuracy, a detailed taxonomy of 33 sheet metal feature types was created. A matrix of interactions between features was generated based on experimental studies on interactions. These details were captured in a process planning system developed in Visual C# as a continuation of previous work done in the research group, to detect and identify the features, and join the features in a network creating conceptual graphs that captures all the different interactions between features based on neighborhoodrelations. Based on this network, toolpath strategies can be selected from a database of ranked toolpath strategies, and used to generate optimized toolpaths, by sequencing and integrating partial toolpaths into continuous toolpaths. A number of case studies were conducted on parts with maximum dimensions determined by the size of the machine tool setup (180 mm x 180 mm blank size) showing average absolute deviations less than 0. 5 mm. Besides, in a number of test cases where uncompensated toolpaths result in maximum deviations larger than 4 mm, the maximum deviations were reduced to less than 1 mm using the optimized strategies. In addition, a number of toolpath strategies based on mathematical compensation techniques using multivariate adaptive response splines (MARS) based predictions, systematic multi step mesh morphing, location specific toolpaths, intelligent offsetting and bottom pre-forming were explored. Using a digital image correlation based measurement set up in collaboration with researchers from the Vrije Universiteit Brussels (VUB), the effect of material properties on the accuracy response surfaces was studied, and generic error correction functions based on material, thickness and size were proposed to improve the accuracy of parts. In order to address the second issue of forming limits, a new system was developed based on the observation of higher ductility limits at low temperatures. In this setup, an in-process cryogenic fluid was used to locally chill down the sheet material to temperatures below - 100 °C, which led to a limited increase in formability limits for aluminium alloys AA 1050, AA 3103 and AA 5754. Test cases showing this improvement were conducted. To illustrate the achievements of the above improvements in the course of the current research, a number of different applications of incremental forming were selectively undertaken as case studies. Few of these applications include a thin <b>sheet</b> <b>die</b> manufacture, a 3 D human face mask manufacture, cranial implant manufacture, and airfoils for aerospace applications, using different sheet materials such as aluminium alloys (AA 1050, AA 3103, AA 5754), low carbon steel alloy DC 01, Titanium grade 2 and stainless steel (AISI 304), where improvements in both accuracy and formability were illustrated.

Collision promotes deformation process, resulting in a drastic change of sheet geometry in which a new distribution of electromagnetic force helps the part to fit the die. The attenuation of force caused by distance increase is comparatively weak when forming into a shallow die, so that the electromagnetic force maintains enough intensity which can effectively suppress the rebound and help to calibrate the V-Shape of the part.
