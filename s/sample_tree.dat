30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the relations between}} growth and the wood properties of Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi), six <b>sample</b> <b>trees</b> of varied ages and radial growth were felled and the ring width, ring density, percentage of latewood, and some other factors were determined. There were significant differences in ring density and percentage of latewood between <b>sample</b> <b>trees</b> with vigorous growth and those with poor growth. In corewood the ring density decreased with increasing ring width for all <b>sample</b> <b>trees,</b> whereas in outerwood this trend did not appear. Moreover, the latewood width increased with the increment of ring width only in outerwood, whereas {{there was almost no}} change in the corewood. The variation in patterns of ring width, ring density, and percentage of latewood in the radial direction and the relation with height was also studied.|$|R

More specifically, after measuring tree height and diameter, approximately 4 – 5 thicker horizontal roots in their diameter of a <b>sample</b> <b>tree</b> were selected, and then, these roots were traced carefully to a diameter larger than 1 – 2  mm. After excavation, the longest horizontal root length was measured.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{functional}} regression model for diameter prediction. Usually stem form is estimated from a regression model using dbh and {{height of the}} <b>sample</b> <b>tree</b> as predictor. With our model additional diameter observations measured at arbitrary locations within the <b>sample</b> <b>tree</b> can be incorporated in the estimation in order to calibrate a standard prediction based on dbh and height. For this purpose, the stem form of a <b>sample</b> <b>tree</b> is modelled as a smooth random function. The observed diameters are assumed as independent realizations from a sample of possible trajectories of the stem contour. The population average of the stem form within a given dbh and height class is estimated with the taper curves applied in the national forest inventory in Germany. Tree deviation from the population average is modelled {{with the help of}} a Karhunen–Loève expansion for the random part of the trajectory. Eigenfunctions and scores of the Karhunen–Loève expansion are estimated through conditional expectations within the methodological framework of functional principal component analysis (FPCA). In addition to a calibrated estimation of the stem form, FPCA provides asymptotic pointwise or simultaneous confidence intervals for the calibrated diameter predictions. For the application of functional principal component analysis modelling the covariance function of the random process is crucial. The main features of the functional regression model are discussed informally and demonstrated by means of practical examples...|$|E

D. b. h. was also measured on all trees within 3 m of each <b>sample</b> <b>tree.</b> Differences in physical characteristics between damaged and undamaged trees were assessed by discriminant and logjt analysis. Damage class was best predicted by clear bole height and surrounding stand density, expressed as number of stems ha" 1.

40|$|Abstract. —A {{wide range}} of {{evolutionary}} models for species-level (and higher) diversification have been developed. These models {{can be used to}} test evolutionary hypotheses and provide comparisons with phylogenetic trees constructed from real data. To carry out these tests and comparisons, it is often necessary to <b>sample,</b> or simulate, <b>trees</b> from the evolutionary mod-els. <b>Sampling</b> <b>trees</b> from these models is more complicated than it may appear at first glance, necessitating careful consid-eration and mathematical rigor. Seemingly straightforward sampling methods may produce trees that have systematically biased shapes or branch lengths. This is particularly problematic as there is no simple method for determining whether the <b>sampled</b> <b>trees</b> are appropriate. In this paper, we show why a commonly used simple sampling approach (SSA) —simulating trees forward in time until n species are first reached—should only be applied to the simplest pure birth model, the Yule model. We provide an alternative general sampling approach (GSA) that can be applied to most other models. Further-more, we introduce the constant-rate birth–death model sampling approach, which <b>samples</b> <b>trees</b> very efficiently from a widely used class of models. We explore the bias produced by SSA and identify situations in which this bias is particularly pronounced. We show that using SSA can lead to erroneous conclusions: When using the inappropriate SSA, the varianc...|$|R

40|$|University of Tübingen We {{present a}} new data {{structure}} for rendering highly complex virtual environments of arbitrary topology. The special feature of our {{approach is that}} it allows an interactive navigation in very large scenes (30 GB/ 400 million polygons in our benchmark scenes) that cannot be stored in main memory, but only on a local or remote hard disk. Furthermore, it allows interactive rendering of substantially more complex scenes by instantiating objects. The sampling process is done in the preprocessing. There, the polygons are randomly distributed in our hierarchical data structure, the randomized <b>sample</b> <b>tree.</b> This tree only uses space that is linear in the number of polygons. In order to produce an approximate image of the scene, the tree is traversed and polygons stored in the visited nodes are rendered. During the interactive walkthrough, parts of the <b>sample</b> <b>tree</b> are loaded from local or remote hard disk. We implemented our algorithm in a prototypical walkthrough system.

40|$|Assuming {{that there}} are no biases in the {{selection}} of bounded plots or trees to be biomassed, the error associated with estimates of stand biomass consists of the error associated with <b>sampling</b> <b>trees</b> for biomass and the error associated with the variability of stand characteristics between bounded plots. At Puruki, the error associated with <b>sampling</b> <b>trees</b> for biomass is generally the larger. Post-stratification of plots according to altitude had little effect on the percentage error associated with estimates of biomass per hectare, partly because post-stratification reduces only one component of the error and partly because it was often reducing the smaller of the two errors. The percentage error associated with estimates of mean net stem weight increment depended on whether it is appropriate to combine data from both years in deriving a relationship between biomass and diameter over bark at breast height. Cost-effective schemes for <b>sampling</b> <b>trees</b> for biomass assume a linear relationship between a function of biomass and a function of diameter.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} a highly efficient technique for deriving accurate and versatile stem curve models. The technique in question is based on relative stem diameters and relative stem heights and is subsequently called the relative stem curve method. The paper focuses on the following three main issues (i) the uniformity and variability of relative stem curves, (ii) the volume and commercial height estimation accuracy of relative stem curve models, and (iii) the number of <b>sample</b> <b>trees</b> required to derive relative stem curve models. It is shown, by an extensive set of stems measured in the field and comprising 1964 stems, that average relative stem curves of different sized trees are highly similar and that the variability of relative stem curves is also quite modest. Consequently the volume and commercial and saw-wood height estimation accuracies are high and the required number of field <b>sample</b> <b>trees</b> low. Standard errors varied from 10 % to 7 % for volume and the required number of <b>sample</b> <b>trees</b> from 1 to 15.
