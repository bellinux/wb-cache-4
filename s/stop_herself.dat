5|$|During Resident Evil 5, Redfield {{discovers that}} Valentine {{is alive and}} goes in search of her. Wesker has {{attached}} a mind-control device to Valentine's chest, which makes her fight Redfield and his new partner, Sheva Alomar, a local agent. Valentine knows that she is doing this but is barely able to <b>stop</b> <b>herself,</b> although she has enough control to open her jumpsuit so that Alomar and Redfield can see the device. Alomar pulls it off and Valentine is freed from Wesker's control. She urges Alomar and Redfield to continue with their mission to stop Wesker. The DLC episode Desperate Escape describes Valentine's escape to safety {{with the help of}} another local BSAA agent, Josh Stone.|$|E
5|$|Professor Onassis, {{who invented}} the time machine in the 1800s, arrives in the {{original}} version of the machine soon after and future Candace steals it. She travels back to the day the boys built the rollercoaster in their backyard and succeeds in getting her mother to see them, finally fulfilling her dream of busting them. However, in doing so, she accidentally leads Perry, their pet platypus who is secretly a suave secret agent, to be injured while stopping an evil magnet mechanism. As a result, Perry's nemesis, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, comes out unharmed {{from the effects of}} the now-destroyed machine. Over time, everything is altered and the Tri-State Area becomes childproof for fear of a repeat of Phineas and Ferb's dangerous activities. Doofenshmirtz eventually gains the upper hand, effectively becoming the ruler. He claims to be a nice Emperor, though, since he can remember everyone's name (though this is considerably easier than it seems, since one of his rules is that everyone has to be named Joe and requires everyone to wear lab coats at all times). Also, because of Doofenshmirtz succeeding, the Agency is now forced into a oath to obey him, resulting a demoralized Perry to fail more on his missions against Doofenshmirtz and is forbidden to use the time machine that Candace previously used as suggested by Major Monogram. After arriving in the dystopian future Doofenshmirtz rules, Candace finds the time machine in a junk yard and returns to the day of the rollercoaster to <b>stop</b> <b>herself</b> from interfering like before, stopping the dystopia from occurring.|$|E
500|$|In the song, Bedingfield {{discusses}} a woman's {{fight to}} <b>stop</b> <b>herself</b> from rushing into relationships {{in an effort}} to find the right man to father her children. Bedingfield stated that she does not want to have children at this point in time, but that she is thinking about it. According to her, [...] "the song is about pacing yourself and taking everything slowly." ...|$|E
60|$|Cynthia was on {{the point}} of indignant-protest, but she <b>stopped</b> <b>herself</b> in time.|$|R
60|$|But she had <b>stopped</b> <b>herself,</b> {{fearing that}} she might say that which would be {{offensive}} to him if she continued.|$|R
6000|$|... "Feeling! You don't know him, Kate," [...] said Mrs. Hale quickly. She <b>stopped</b> <b>herself,</b> {{but with}} a half-smiling {{recollection}} in her dropped eyelids.|$|R
500|$|... "I Wanna Have Your Babies" [...] {{is a song}} by British {{recording}} artist Natasha Bedingfield. It was written by Steve Kipner, Andrew Frampton, Wayne Wilkins and Bedingfield for her second album, N.B. (2007). The song's musical-style and production was inspired by hip hop music, and its lyrics discuss a woman's battle to <b>stop</b> <b>herself</b> from rushing into relationships {{in an effort to}} find the right man to be the father of her children.|$|E
500|$|The episode further {{develops}} {{the relationship between}} Bree and Chuck, which is complicated by her involvement in the cover-up. [...] "Bree’s dilemma {{is the fact that}} she’s falling for a cop and trying to cover up this crime that she was sort of the ringleader on," [...] Daily explained. [...] "So her thing is instead of balancing work and pleasure, it’s balancing crime and pleasure." [...] Cross stated, [...] "I think we’ll figure out if that’s really a big love for her or if she’s able to let it go." [...] Jonathan Cake, who appeared as Chuck in four episodes during the seventh season, was promoted to series regular with this episode. On the relationship between Bree and Chuck, Cake stated: [...] "As a detective, he's sort of drawn to this woman who seems both quite proper and conservative and yet can't seem to <b>stop</b> <b>herself</b> from being drawn into these sort of crazy, lurid scenarios. There's a sort of wild streak in Bree somewhere that he thinks is really interesting." [...] To prepare for the role, Cake watched key episodes of the series focusing on Bree's previous relationships.|$|E
2500|$|... "How Do You Do?", {{the opening}} track about flirting, {{features}} guitars and a horn section. [...] "I Wanna Have Your Babies", the second track, {{was chosen as}} the lead single as it was a representation Bedingfield's shifting priorities from being a single young woman to [...] "dating, searching for a partner" [...] and [...] "looking for Mr Right". The song discusses a woman's battle to <b>stop</b> <b>herself</b> from rushing into relationships in an effort to find the right man to be the father of her children. The song received mixed reviews from music critics, who generally found it to be less impressive than past releases, but its release was moderately successful, reaching the top forty in most countries. The second single, [...] "Soulmate", is a ballad on which Bedingfield wonders if there is a partner for everyone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she answered. [...] "I am fonder than--" [...] And {{then she}} <b>stopped</b> <b>herself</b> {{suddenly}} and flared scarlet. [...] "Who {{are you talking}} about?" [...] she demanded.|$|R
6000|$|She <b>stopped</b> <b>herself</b> after saying, [...] "I {{see what}} you mean," [...] and suggested, [...] "I think I should be guided by circumstances. It needn't be done at once, I suppose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm so glad!" [...] She descended {{upon him}} with outstretched arms, but <b>stopped</b> <b>herself</b> before she reached him. [...] "It's a hoax. What do you mean? Do you really mean it, Dan?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Sorry" [...] {{was written}} by Ciara, who was {{credited}} to her full birth name Ciara Princess Harris, Elvis Williams, and Jasper Cameron, and was produced by Harris and Cameron at Royaly Rightings and Universal Music Corporation in Santa Monica, California. The three had previously worked together on Ciara's singles, [...] "Promise" [...] (2006) and [...] "Never Ever" [...] (2009). On August 25, 2012, while speaking to Claudia Jordan on Centric's The Hot 10, Ciara described [...] "Sorry" [...] as a [...] "very, very real record," [...] {{and went on to}} tell Essence magazine that she had to <b>stop</b> <b>herself</b> from crying while writing the song. Although Ciara never confirmed who the song was about, she assured it wasn't about ex-boyfriend Amar'e Stoudemire. It was later confirmed that the song was indeed referring to her bad break-up with rapper 50 Cent, and then followed an apology dedicated to Ciara via Twitter from himself.|$|E
2500|$|In her {{autobiography}} Cross Creek {{first published}} in 1942, Rawlings described how she owned many acres of land and also hired many people to help her with day-to-day chores and activities. An entire chapter {{of the book is}} dedicated to one woman she hired, whose name was Beatrice, but whom she was affectionately known as [...] "GeeChee", because the woman was ethnically part of the GeeChee people. In the book Rawlings said GeeChee's mother lived in nearby Hawthorne, Florida and GeeChee was blind in one eye from a fight she was involved in. GeeChee was employed by Rawlings on and off for nearly two years in which GeeChee dutifully made life easier for Rawlings. GeeChee revealed to Rawlings that her boyfriend named Leroy was serving time in prison for manslaughter, and asked Rawlings for help in gaining his release. She arranged for Leroy to be paroled to her and come work for her estate, and had a wedding on the grounds for Beatrice and Leroy. After a few weeks, Leroy aggressively demanded for more earnings from Rawlings and threatened her. She decided he had to leave, which caused her distress because she did not want GeeChee to go with him, and was sure she would. GeeChee eventually decided to stay with Rawlings, but GeeChee began to drink heavily and abandoned her. Weeks later, Rawlings went out searching for GeeChee and drove her back to her estate, describing GeeChee as a [...] "Black Florence Nightingale". GeeChee was unable to <b>stop</b> <b>herself</b> from drinking, which led a heartbroken Rawlings to dismiss her. Rawlings stated in her autobiography [...] "No maid of perfection--and now I have one--can fill the strange emptiness she left in a remote corner of my heart. I think of her often, and I know she does of me, for she comes once a year to see me".|$|E
60|$|She {{knew that}} tone, that {{expression}} on his face, knew he was angry; but could not <b>stop</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Eleanor {{was going}} to say [...] "would let him," [...] but she <b>stopped</b> <b>herself</b> before she had {{compromised}} her father's dignity; and giving a long sigh, she added--"Oh, I do so wish he would." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Bell; {{and then}} she <b>stopped</b> <b>herself</b> from further speech, not as {{intending}} to convey all her answer in that one word, but as {{not knowing how to}} fashion any further words.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sarah," [...] said she, {{and then}} she <b>stopped</b> <b>herself.</b> [...] "Never mind; it is natural, no doubt, you should feel it; {{but there are times}} and places when one's {{feelings}} should be kept under control." ...|$|R
60|$|They set off. Marianne had {{at first}} the advantage, but a false step brought her {{suddenly}} to the ground; and Margaret, unable to <b>stop</b> <b>herself</b> to assist her, was involuntarily hurried along, and reached the bottom in safety.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] he answered. [...] "The {{woman could}} not <b>stop</b> <b>herself</b> {{and this is}} not a {{residential}} building at all. All the lower floors are let for offices and warehouses, and there is no one else in the place until eight o'clock." ...|$|E
60|$|And so she did: {{wandering}} up and down, {{and trying}} turn after turn, but always {{coming back to}} the house, do what she would. Indeed, once, when she turned a corner rather more quickly than usual, she ran against it before she could <b>stop</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E
60|$|When {{the girls}} came on deck they found Baxter {{doing some of}} the work which Dick and Tom had been doing the morning before. At first they were {{inclined}} to laugh, but Dora <b>stopped</b> <b>herself</b> and her cousins.|$|R
60|$|The rabbit-hole went {{straight}} {{on like a}} tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about <b>stopping</b> <b>herself</b> before she found herself falling down a very deep well.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Woodburn began, [...] "Oh, mah-" [...] {{and then}} <b>stopped</b> <b>herself.</b> Alma's mother {{looked at her}} with distressed question, but the girl seemed {{perfectly}} cool and contented; and she gave her mind provisionally to a point suggested by Colonel Woodburn's talk.|$|R
60|$|Miss Fosbrook hurried back, hearing Hal's rude {{laugh as}} she came nearer, it was Elizabeth, sobbing in the passionate {{way in which it}} is not good to see a child cry, and violently shaking off Susan, who was begging her to <b>stop</b> <b>herself</b> before Miss Fosbrook should come.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will think}} of you always, and your name will be sacred to us, and that will teach us singleness and devotion," [...] Verena went on, in the same tone, still not meeting Ransom's eyes again, and {{speaking}} {{as if she were}} trying now to <b>stop</b> <b>herself,</b> to tie herself by a vow.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You can't {{expect that}} she should go and {{sacrifice}} herself for you, you know,' said Mrs. Davis, who {{now that she had}} begun hardly knew how to <b>stop</b> <b>herself.</b> 'A girl's time is her money. She's at her best now, and a girl like her must make her hay while the sun shines. She can't go on fal-lalling with you, and then nothing to come of it. You mustn't suppose she's to lose her market that way.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, why didn't you let"--She <b>stopped</b> <b>herself</b> quickly, {{but could}} not stop the fierce glint in her eye nor the sharp curve in her nostril. Luckily, Leonidas did not see this, being preoccupied with his other graceful charmer, William Henry.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I mean, {{is it too}} late? I mean, can {{you really}} forgive me? Oh, Bill'--she <b>stopped</b> <b>herself</b> by the {{fraction}} of a second from adding 'you idiot'--'can't we be the same again to each other? Can't we--pretend all this has never happened?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why shouldn't a girl {{be engaged}} {{to a man}} named Jones? Jones {{is as good a}} name as Moss, at any rate; and a deal more--" [...] She had been going to remark that Jones was the more Christian of the two, but <b>stopped</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|R
60|$|When Dullhead {{heard this}} he marched before the Princess with his goose and its appendages, {{and as soon}} as she saw these seven people {{continually}} running after each other she burst out laughing, and could not <b>stop</b> <b>herself.</b> Then Dullhead claimed her as his bride, but the King, who did not much fancy him as a son-in-law, made all sorts of objections, and told him he must first find a man who could drink up a whole cellarful of wine.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Polly, {{before she}} could <b>stop</b> <b>herself,</b> and then could have bitten her tongue out for being so rude. Another awful pause seemed impending, but just at that moment a {{horseman}} clattered by {{with a smile and}} a salute, which caused Polly to exclaim, [...] "Oh, there 's Tom!" [...] with a tone and a look that silenced the words hovering on Sydney's lips, and caused him to hold out his hand with a look which made Polly's heart flutter then and ache with pity for a good while afterward, though he only said, [...] "Good by, Polly." ...|$|E
60|$|The hunted {{man turned}} {{around with a}} little gasp. Before him was the rude {{mountain}} bridge, {{and on the other}} side--freedom. Scarcely a dozen lengths away was Lenora, and close behind her came Quest. He slackened speed as he walked his horse cautiously on to the planked bridge. Suddenly he gave a little cry. The frail structure, unexpectedly insecure, seemed to sway beneath his weight. Lenora, who had been riding fast, was unable to <b>stop</b> <b>herself.</b> She came on to the bridge at a half canter. Craig, who had reached the other side in safety, threw up his hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "His {{mother was}} dead, sir, before ever I {{set eyes on}} him or his father; and though I tried to do my--" [...] and then she <b>stopped</b> <b>herself</b> suddenly. Honesty {{might be the best}} policy, but, nevertheless, was it {{necessary}} that she should tell everything to this stranger? ...|$|R
40|$|It’s easy to agonize {{over every}} word and grow {{frustrated}} at a stunted word count. Here, Helen Sword explains how she <b>stops</b> <b>herself</b> from spending days pushing words {{around in circles}} and joins W. B. Yeats, Oscar Wilde and Ernest Hemingway as she embraces slower, well-tempered academic writing as a craft...|$|R
50|$|Preparing for {{her next}} flight mission, Starbuck <b>stops</b> <b>herself</b> from {{entering}} her Viper cockpit when she sees her younger self sitting in the seat. Visibly shaken, she tells Apollo she is unable to trust herself and cannot fly. Apollo comforts her by offering to be her wingman for the flight.|$|R
