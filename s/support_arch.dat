50|$|In modern construction, {{temporary}} towers are erected {{and supported}} by cables anchored in the ground. Temporary cables fly from each side to <b>support</b> <b>arch</b> segments as they are constructed. When the arches are almost complete a jacking bridge is placed over or beneath the gap to force the arches apart, whence the final section is constructed in place or lifted into position.|$|E
50|$|In engineering, {{abutment}} {{refers to}} the substructure {{at the ends of}} a bridge span or dam whereon the structure's superstructure rests or contacts. Single-span bridges have abutments at each end which provide vertical and lateral support for the bridge, as well as acting as retaining walls to resist lateral movement of the earthen fill of the bridge approach. Multi-span bridges require piers to support ends of spans unsupported by abutments. Dam abutments are generally either side of a valley or gorge but may be artificial in order to <b>support</b> <b>arch</b> dams such as Kurobe Dam in Japan.|$|E

50|$|To {{prevent the}} advance of Confederate troops {{across the river from}} the Wrightsville (York County) side during the Civil War, the bridge was burned by Union militia under Maj. Granville O. Haller and Col. Jacob G. Frick on June 28, 1863. Civilian volunteers from Columbia had mined the bridge at the fourth span from the Wrightsville side, {{originally}} hoping to drop the whole 200 ft span into the river, but when the charges were detonated, only small portions of the <b>support</b> <b>arch</b> splintered, leaving the span passable. As Confederates advanced onto the bridge, Union forces set fire to it near the Wrightsville side. Earlier they had saturated the structure with crude oil from a Columbia refinery.|$|E

50|$|The {{cast iron}} bridge was reconstructed {{at a cost}} of £95,887. The bridge opened for traffic on 14 May 1914 with new {{features}} to allow more clearance for the many boats that had to pass under it. The <b>supporting</b> <b>arched</b> trusses were built further apart and above the road deck. Trams continued to use the bridge until the tram system was abandoned in 1930 and superseded by buses.|$|R
50|$|It is {{believed}} that the jaws evolved from anterior gill <b>support</b> <b>arches</b> that had acquired a new role, being modified to pump water over the gills by opening and closing the mouth more effectively - the buccal pump mechanism. The mouth could then grow bigger and wider, {{making it possible to}} capture larger prey. This close and open mechanism would, with time, become stronger and tougher, being transformed into real jaws.|$|R
