Modeling the optical system of the surface encoder based on interference and diffraction is carried out. The 2 -D angle grid surface, which is a superposition of the X- and Y-directional sine waves, is treated as a phase grating with a phase shifting function. The components of the <b>slope</b> <b>sensor</b> are also modeled precisely to obtain the actual intensity distribution of the light spot on the photodetector (QPD) of the sensor. Feasibility of the proposed wave optics model of the surface encoder has been confirmed by results of simulation and experiment...|$|E

Using <b>Slope</b> <b>sensor</b> to test the Dynamic deflection is a good way for highway bridge deflection detection. In this paper, we develop a new <b>slope</b> <b>sensor</b> and new theory to fast calculate deflection from slope angle. It has been use to detect the dynamic deflections of songhuajiang bridge on Harbin-Changchuen highway when car cross at kinds of speed. The test result indicates: comparing with the measurement results of photoelectric deflection detection system, the dynamic deflection measurement results of slope sensors are much closed. Their deflection curves are also similar. The result also shows: Using our slope sensors to test highway bridge dynamic deflection can get precise results and can satisfy the highway bridge deflection testing request. It is also very easy to use. You can finish the testing easily and do not stop the traffic...|$|E

The diffractive element wavefront sensor (DEWS) produces four double overlapping copies of the incoming wavefront acting like a combination of shearing and pyramidal sensors. The DEWS allows a simple and fast slope estimate. The wavefront sampling can {{be as high as}} the number of pixel assigned to cover a wavefront copy, and it can be modified with only binning the CCD pixels. The theory for designing the sensor, its application to extract local slope information, and a simple noise analysis are presented.

40|$|Abstract-Steele et al. 131 {{present an}} {{extensive}} set of linear calibration techniques that {{are applied to}} NDBC wave-buoy sensor spectral output before calculating and disseminating directional wave spectra. We here identify and estimate the nonlinear effects that produce biases still present in the output. These effects are due both to wave nonlinearities themselves and to constraints on the buoy and mooring system to the driving forces. Simple models used here show that these nonlinearities can produce spectral energy biases of 5 - 15 percent at and above the spectral peak frequency, and even greater errors below it. NDBC presently records wave data from vertically stabilized and fixed accelerometers and <b>slope</b> <b>sensors.</b> Our calculations show that these sensors all incur bias due to wave nonlinearities; this bias is greatest for vertically stabilized acceler-ometers and is least for <b>slope</b> <b>sensors.</b> Effects of the resulting inconsisten-cies between the different sensors are most pronounced below the spectral peak where the nonlinear terms dominate; these effects are illustrate...|$|R
40|$|Two {{projects}} {{dealing with}} field instrumentation of bridges {{are described in}} this report. In the first project, a portable, rugged and multi-purpose bridge instrumentation system was developed. This was accomplished by using fourteen removable instruments and a portable data acquisition. The instrumentation included eight reusable strain sensors and six inclinometers, which allowed load distributions, stresses, and displacements to be measured in steel girder bridges. In {{the second part of}} the project the portable data acquisition system was used to measure strains near fatigue critical details in steel bridges to determine stress ranges under both controlled and random traffic. For this part of the project conventional strain gauges were also used. Overall this acquisition and modelling system worked quite well for determining strains and deflections of simply supported bridges under static loadings. A new measurement technique for finding deflections, based on <b>slope</b> <b>sensors,</b> was developed and verified. This technique can now be readily used in bridge evaluation. The system should be extended now to various types of bridges including continuous span, concrete girder, and timber bridges. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{slope angle}} {{is one of}} the most {{influential}} factors which limit the control performance and the energy efficiency of not only internal-combustion engine vehicles but also electrified vehicles such as hybrid vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. However, measuring the slope angle is not easy because <b>slope</b> <b>sensors</b> are not sufficiently accurate and they are too expensive to implement in vehicles. In this study, the climbing angle as well as the slope angle are considered in the presence of yawing motion on a sloping road, and both angles are estimated. In order to describe the combined vehicle motions when turning on a sloping road, a new three-dimensional dynamics model is proposed including the heading angle with respect to the road slope orientation. The extended Kalman filter is designed on the basis of the three-dimensional dynamics model on a sloping road, and the key parameters for the sloping road are updated using the geometry relationship. The proposed estimation method is evaluated using simulations and field tests with a hybrid electric vehicle.

40|$|International audienceSmall scale {{surface waves}} in the capillary-gravity region can be easily advected by surface {{currents}} from all sources. Temporal measurements using fixed-point wave probes, therefore, cannot resolve reliably the spatial or wavenumber structure of short waves unless the surface currents are also monitored, which is an even more difficult task than surface wave measurement. A two-dimensional scanning <b>slope</b> <b>sensor</b> system is developed to perform 4 D measurements [Ñh(x,y,t) ] of small scale surface waves. The data yield 3 D spectrum [B(kx,ky,w) ] covering the capillary-gravity wave scales. Reflection of short waves as described by Shyu and Phillips (1990) can be clearly seen. The directional properties of small scale waves would be influenced by this mechanism greatly.

40|$|It {{is shown}} how the {{solenoidal}} component of {{noise from the}} measurements of a wavefront <b>slope</b> <b>sensor</b> can be utilized to estimate the total noise: specifically, the ensemble noise variance. It {{is well known that}} solenoidal noise is orthogonal to the reconstruction of the wavefront under conditions of low scintillation (absence of wavefront vortices). Therefore, it can be retrieved even with a nonzero slope signal present. By explicitly estimating the solenoidal noise from an ensemble of slopes, it can be retrieved for any wavefront sensor configuration. Furthermore, the ensemble variance is demonstrated {{to be related to the}} total noise variance via a straightforward relationship. This relationship is revealed via the method of the explicit estimation: it consists of a small, heuristic set of four constants that do not depend on the underlying statistics of the incoming wavefront. These constants seem to apply to all situations—data from a laboratory experiment as well as many configurations of numerical simulation—so the method is concluded to be generic...|$|E
40|$|With an {{imminent}} future of fully autonomous heavy duty vehicles in offroad applications, {{the need for}} advanced control system will increase accordingly. By implementing a raster map with tiles and pixels, to which a vehicle can record slope and position data while driving, {{it is possible to}} map earth's surface. By adding a heat parameter to every pixel, i. e. the number of passings through it historically, it is possible in future visits of the same are to generate a route prediction made up by the "hottest" pixels. By fetching the slope values in the hottest pixels, it is possible to generate a slope horizon that can be utilized by control systems, e. g. when planning gear shifts in hilly offroad terrain. To mange the incrementally growing map, a memory management system was implemented. It buffers the relevant map data from the database, i. e. the vehicles closest surroundings, which is then used for route prediction and horizon generation. As the vehicle moves into other areas, new data is read from the database, and the recently passed area is written back to the database, however updated from the recent passing. The system is implemented so that it runs through another application in the telematics electrical controller unit (ECU) in a Scania vehicle. The ECU contains a GNSS module from which the vehicle fetches satellite positioning data. Slope data is fetched from a <b>slope</b> <b>sensor</b> mounted on the truck. Due to implications during testing and debugging of the resulting application developed and implemented during this thesis project, the application's performance couldn't be assessed properly. However, it is concluded that the background the application is built on is reliable, although tweaks to get the application fit for usage in offroad terrain had to be made. Mainly, the horizon length and map building techniques should not be the same as in similar applications for onroad driving...|$|E

A certain class of optical sensors does not measure {{the shape of an}} object but rather its local <b>slope.</b> These <b>sensors</b> display several advantages, including high information efficiency, sensitivity, and robustness. For many applications, however, it is necessary to acquire the shape, which must be calculated from the slopes by numerical integration. Existing integration techniques show drawbacks that render them unusable in many cases. Our method is based on an approximation employing radial basis functions. It can be applied to irregularly sampled, noisy, and incomplete data, and it reconstructs surfaces both locally and globally with high accuracy. (C) 2008 Optical Society of America...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} on granular flows using natural material {{were carried out}} in order to investigate the behaviour of granular flows passing over a break in <b>slope.</b> <b>Sensors</b> in the depositional area recorded the flow kinematics, while video footage permitted reconstruction of the deposit formation, which allowed investigation of the deposit shape {{as a function of}} the change in slope. We defined the slope-angle ratio as the proportion between slope angle in the depositional area and that of the channel. When the granular flow encounters the break in slope part of the flow front forms a bouncing clast zone due to elastic impact with the expansion box floor. During this process, part of the kinetic energy of the dense granular flow is transferred to elutriating fine ash, which subsequently forms turbulent ash cloud accompanying the granular flow until it comes to rest. Morphometric analysis of the deposits shows that they are all elliptical, with an almost constant minor axis and a variable major axis. The almost constant value of the minor axis relates to the spreading angle of flow at the end of the channel, which resembles the basal friction angle of the material. The variation of the major axis is interpreted to relate to the effect of competing inertial and frictional forces. This effect also reflects the partitioning of centripetal and tangential velocities, which changes as the flow passes over the break in slope. After normalization, morphometric data provided empirical relationships that highlight the dependence of runout from the product of slope-angle ratio and the difference in height between granular material release and deposit. The empirical relationships were tested against the runouts of hot avalanches formed during the 1944 ad eruption at Vesuvius, with differences among actual and calculated values are between 1. 7 and 15  %. Velocity measurements of laboratory granular flows record deceleration paths at different breaks in slope. When normalized, the velocity data show third-order polynomial fit, highlighting a complex behaviour involving interplay between inertial and frictional forces. The theoretical velocity decays were tested against the data published for volcaniclastic debris flows of the 5 – 6 May 1998 event in the Sarno area. The comparison is very good for non-channelized debris flows, with significant differences between actual and calculated velocities for the channelized debris flows...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{details the}} concept of {{retrofitting}} inclinometer casings with active waveguides {{in order to provide}} subsurface instrumentation that can monitor the stability of slopes continuously and in real-time. The operation of the active waveguide, the unitary battery operated Slope ALARMS acoustic emission sensor and warning communication system are described. A field trial previously reported by the authors demonstrates that acoustic emission rates generated by active waveguides are proportional to the velocity of slope displacements, and can therefore be used to detect changes in rates of movement (i. e. accelerations and decelerations) in response to destabilising (e. g. rainfall) and stabilising (e. g. remediation) effects. The paper presents the results of a field trial of the acoustic monitoring system retrofitted inside an inclinometer casing in a reactivated landslide at Hollin Hill, North Yorkshire, UK. The study demonstrates that this approach can provide continuous information on slope movements with high temporal resolution. Converting manually and periodically read inclinometer casings into continuously monitored active waveguides using <b>Slope</b> ALARMS <b>sensors</b> is a cost effective solution to provide real-time information {{that could be used in}} the protection of people and infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|Light {{detection}} and ranging, or LiDAR, effectively produces products spatially characterizing both terrain and vegetation structure; however, {{development and use}} of those products has outpaced our understanding of the errors within them. LiDAR’s ability to capture three-dimensional structure has led to interest in conducting or augmenting forest inventories with LiDAR data. Prior to applying LiDAR in operational management, it is necessary to understand the errors in Li- DAR-derived estimates of forest inventory metrics (i. e., tree height). Most LiDAR-based forest inventory metrics require creation of digital elevation models (DEM), and because metrics are calculated relative to the DEM surface, errors within the DEMs propagate into delivered metrics. This study combines LiDAR DEMs and 54 ground survey plots to investigate how surface morphology and vegetation structure influence DEM errors. The study further compared two LiDAR classification algorithms and found no significant difference in their performance. Vegetation structure was found to have no influence, whereas increased variability in the vertical error was observed on slopes exceeding 30 °, illustrating that these algorithms are not limited by high-biomass western coniferous forests, but that <b>slope</b> and <b>sensor</b> accuracy both play important roles. The observed vertical DEM error translated into ± 1 %– 3 % error range in derived timber volumes, highlighting the potential of LiDAR-derived inventories in forest management...|$|R

We show that if the phase varies slowly in space, and the focal spot size relative to the centroid integration area approaches zero – this variation does not affect the centroid. This is a consequence of symmetry properties of the Fresnel operator. We then show that when the focal width is not infinitely small, changes in the field amplitude can exacerbate distortion of the centroid results...|$|R

In order to monitor such concentration profiles, NO 2 sensors are required that o#er high sensitivity at low concentration. Presently, expensive systems based on Chemoluminescence are used for this purpose. Cheap sensors like, e. g., surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors [1], [2] using phthalocyanines as the sensor film, are presently not well suited for this task because they either lack sensitivity or exhibit a drift of the baseline together with a sensor signal that depends on previous expositions to the test gas. Furthermore, times exceeding 30 min are required to reach equilibrium after a concentration change. Here we present a technique that cycles a SAW sensor between a well defined initial state reached by rapid desorption and exposition to the test gas [3].

40|$|The {{limiting}} {{performance characteristics}} of con-focal chromatic aberration displacement sensors are angular tolerance and the gauge range over which an output is provided. The sensor selected {{in this study}} is used to measure groove profiles in early recorded surfaces. The sensor is used in a 3 dimensional cylinder scanning system for the measurement of wax cylinder recordings, where the 3 dimensional data is used to create a map of the measured surface for archival purposes. The generation of the map allows the sound recorded on the surface to be decoded without physical contact to the surface. It has been shown in a previous study that data resolution of 10 - 20 nm are required for this application, and that the relationship between the data output and the surface incline is critical to system performance. To understand the relationship with surface <b>slope</b> the <b>sensor</b> is used here in a study of the measurement of calibration ball surfaces, and follows a previous study on machined grooves with known angular properties. In this study a range of calibration spherical surfaces are used to investigate the relationship between the sensor output and measurement parameters, including the distance between the sensor optical head and the surface.

In a next step the model is fitted to the measured data to determine tilts and directions of sensors and the underlying terrain slope. This then allows us to correct the measured albedo, the radiative balance and the energy balance. Depending on the direction of the <b>slope</b> and the <b>sensors</b> a comparison between measured and corrected albedo values reveals obvious over- or underestimations of albedo.

Co-located, continuous snow depth and soil moisture measurements were deployed in a rain-snow transition catchment in the mixed-conifer forest in the Southern Sierra Nevada. At each elevation sensors were placed in the open, under the canopy, and at the drip edge on both north- and south-facing <b>slopes.</b> Snow <b>sensors</b> were placed at 27 locations, with soil moisture and temperature sensors placed at depths of 10, 30, 60, and 90 cm beneath the snow sensor. Soils are weakly developed (Inceptisols and Entisols) and formed from decomposed granite with properties that change with elevation. The soil- bedrock interface is hard in upper reaches of the basin (> 2000 m) where glaciers have scoured the parent material approximately 18, 000 yr ago. Below an elevation of 2000 m soils have a paralithic contact (weathered saprolite) that can extend beyond a depth of 1. 5 m, facilitating pathways for deep percolation. Soils are wet and not frozen in winter, and dry out in the weeks following spring snowmelt and rain. Based on data from two snowmelt seasons, it was found that soils dry out following snowmelt at relatively uniform rates; however, the timing of drying at a given site may be offset by up to 4 wk because of heterogeneity in snowmelt at different elevations and aspects. Spring and summer rainfall mainly affected sites in the open, with drying after a rain event being faster than following snowmelt. Water loss rates from soil of 0. 5 to 1. 0 cm d - 1 during the winter and snowmelt season reflect a combination of evapotranspiration and deep drainage, as stream baseflow remains relatively low. About one-third of annual evapotranspiration comes from water storage below the 1 -m depth, that is, below mapped soil. We speculate that much of the deep drainage is stored locally in the deeper regolith during periods of high precipitation, being available for tree transpiration during summer and fall months when shallow soil water storage is limiting. Total annual evapotranspiration for water year 2009 was estimated to be approximately 76 cm. © Soil Science Society of America...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Data on {{avalanche}} {{activity are}} of vital importance for avalanche forecasting. Avalanche ac-tivity is usually estimated based on visual observations, which are imprecise and impossible {{at night or}} when visibility is limited. In recent years various researchers have developed automatic avalanche detec-tion systems to overcome these shortcomings. Over the last three winters we have developed a seismic sensor array to continuously monitor elastic waves in the snow cover on an avalanche slope near Davos (Eastern Swiss Alps). Due to the low frequency and high sensitivity of the sensors considerable back-ground noise originating from the nearby town and ski hills was also recorded. Additional observations methods, such as cameras and a microphone, were installed to characterize sources of background noise. Since the deployment of the first prototype system {{in the winter of}} 2008, numerous avalanches have released on <b>slopes</b> nearby the <b>sensor</b> array, and on the instrumented slope itself. This enabled us to determine specific characteristics in the time-frequency representation of seismic signals generated by avalanches. Using this information we developed a preliminary method to detect and characterize the recorded signals, which is of vital importance to remove any signal not related to avalanches. Further-more, we are also able to distinguish loose snow avalanches from slab avalanches. The seismic sensor array therefore provides objective avalanche activity data for a limited area (i. e. about 1 km 2). The devel-opment of the sensor array, the signal processing methods as well as a comparison of avalanche activity data with meteorological data from a nearby automatic weather station are presented...|$|R
40|$|At {{the time}} when the signiﬁcance of water becomes more than obvious, we realize the utility of models that {{describe}} hydrological phenomena and that permit the optimization of water management. The soil properties, as they have an inﬂuence both on hydrology and on plant development, are an element really essential in this type of model. But, as for tree characteristics, these properties are spatially and temporally variable. Therefore this research will specially focus on the case of forested slopes. The study will be divided into three parts. The ﬁrst will characterize the vertical and the horizontal heterogeneity of the structural and hydrodynamic properties of soil. To do this, in addition to the analysis of the soil sampled along the <b>slope,</b> moisture <b>sensors</b> will be installed on different places on a slope and on different depths. For the greatest part it will be capacitive sensors whose values will be conﬁrmed by TDR sensors. Each sensor will be inserted to cover the largest pedological and topographic variability. The second part of the study will permit to characterize the water ﬂux repartition into the horizons down the slope. We will therefore apply a dye to surface {{on the top of the}} slope. The bottom of the slope will be equipped with an experimental system which collects water for each soil layer. The third parts will deal with the forest stand heterogeneity along the slope. We will measure characteristics such as tree height, roots repartition, stem circumference and also for different periods of the year, leaf area index (LAI). At the end of the research, we will measure tree rings for a dendrochronolocical study. The collected data will be analyzed to determine the slope effects on the soil properties, on the water ﬂux distribution into the soil layer and on the tree characteristics. Afterwards the relations and the interactions can be conceptualized and introduced into a physical hydrological model. The studied slope is located on the Houille watershed in the West of the Belgian Ardenne. The site is situated under a Douglas ﬁr cover (Pseudotsuga menziesii (MIRB.) FRANCO). It is about 170 meters long with an average slope of 25 %. There are only few studies that attempt to connect physical models and the tree growth at the slope scale, leaving a vast untapped investigation area in the hydrological modelling. The study of this variability would afford possibility to improve hydrological models. From the point of view of the climate change, such a model would e. g. determine the best adapted species to each forest site. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of {{important}} infrastructures such as Portland cement concrete pavements {{plays a key}} role in pioneer societies, to guarantee the optimum usability and performance of the infrastructure system. As an example, this is imperative to appraise the destruction level in Portland cement concrete pavements along time as to plan their maintenance with proper actions at the right time. Based on this premise, the goal of this study is to extend an extensive feasibility study to set up a novel approach for SHM of Portland cement concrete pavements and remaining life estimation, based on self-sensing concrete-CNTs sensors added with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The concrete-CNTs sensors are applied as piezoresistive sensors (i. e. to collect information such as weight and species of passing vehicles), or as destruction identification sensors (i. e. to detect crack propagation in the Portland cement concrete pavement). For casting the concrete-CNTs sensors, some parameters are important, such as the number of CNTs, species of surfactant, dispersion quality etc. In this research, the dispersion quality of multi-walled carbon nanotubes in the aqueous phase and cement matrix was experiment examined using Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrophotometry (UV-VIS), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and mechanical experiments for compressive and flexural strength. The outcomes demonstrated that a new specific surfactant composition (sodiumdodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDS) and superplasticizer carboxylate base (SP-C) with the ratio of 1 : 9 respectively) could disperse MWCNTs around 64 % more than other surfactant combinations indicated in the previous studies while this has enough compatibility with the concrete to omit antifoam in the mixing process and maintain the concrete mechanical specifications pretty constant. To appraise the influences of the main parameters affecting concrete-CNTs sensors function, diverse criteria in static and dynamic loading patterns were defined such as sensitivity of the sensor (Se), the standard deviation of the prediction error, repeatability (Re), cross-correlation (CC) and hysteresis (SSE). The dynamic criteria such as sensitivity, internal repeatability, cross-correlation and hysteresis declared that the dispersion energy levels for the dispersion of MWCNTs have a major impact on enhancing the function of the sensor rather than the number of CNTs. The repeatability criterion, contrariwise, showed that the number of MWCNTs has a major impact on the function of the sensor compared to the dispersion quality (dispersion energy level) of MWCNTs. Consequently, both parameters have to be regarded as relevant. The overall outcomes showed that the sensors fabricated with 0. 15 wt% CNTs, superplasticizer and SDS as a surfactant using the maximum dispersion energy level (ultrasonic bath for 2 hours and 90 minutes of ultrasonic probing) have the best function in both static and dynamic load mode. To explore the influences of traffic loads on the pavement, concrete-CNTs sensors were experiment examined under various value of dynamic loads. The outcomes demonstrated that the maximum exterior load applied on the sensor (Fmax) is linearly correlated to the maximum response of the sensor (Smax) via a constant coefficient tagα/tagβ, in which tagα is defined as the slope of the Force vs. Time graph and tagβ is defined as the <b>slope</b> of the <b>Sensor's</b> response vs. Time curve. So, this can be concluded that the application of the indicated concrete-CNTs sensors for piezoresistive applications is feasible and the sensors can appraise the load with of high-goodness of fit (R 2 adj. > 0. 99). In addition, to study the response of the concrete-CNTs sensor under the traffic loading, fatigue experiments were run. An alternative data processing log(G) -log(N) was applied instead of traditional S-log(N) fatigue graphs (Goodman curves), based on the electrical sensor response with a linear regression approach and the outcomes were verified by statistical tests. In this research, the concept of G has been defined for the first time as the <b>slope</b> of a <b>sensor's</b> response that reflects the destruction created in a pavement because of one pass of vehicle load. Based on these findings, two various types of remaining life models for Portland cement concrete pavements were proposed...|$|R
40|$|Ion-selective {{electrodes}} (ISE 2 ̆ 7 s) {{are routinely}} {{used to measure}} electrolyte concentrations in biological fluids such as blood and urine. The process involves the transduction of ion activity to a potential within a sensing membrane. This membrane typically consists of a plastic phase (e. g., plasticized PVC) impregnated with a highly specific ion-binding molecule. It is desirable to determine the relationship between formulation and function. Such knowledge would enable developers to achieve required performance specifications for <b>sensor</b> <b>slope,</b> longevity, and transient response. This research focused on the analysis of a planar format Na+ sensor, fabricated {{with the use of}} thick-film screen printing technology. A model was developed to interpret electrode responses in terms of fundamental physical processes. These processes included interfacial transport (kinetics, solubility), electrodiffusion (Nernst-Planck), and ion-ionophore complexation. Potentials were calculated from the Poisson equation using the resulting time-dependent concentration distributions. Model mechanisms were converted to mathematical expressions and discretized for computer simulation. Experimental design techniques were used to efficiently determine the significance of model input parameters. Results from this exercise specified membrane formulations to be fabricated, tested, and compared to the model. Both model and laboratory sensors revealed a diffusion controlled 2 ̆ 2 warm-up 2 ̆ 2 conditioning phase upon sample exposure. When membrane formulations and thicknesses were varied, electrode responses were altered in the direction predicted by the model. It was concluded that the model could predict the direction of 2 ̆ 2 warm-up 2 ̆ 2 and transient responses with regard to voltage and time as a result of changing inputs. Such correlation between model and laboratory advocates that sensor performance is determined by the physical and chemical parameters of the membrane; hence, formulation and thickness. In addition, the research showed that membrane function {{is not limited to the}} electrode/electrolyte interface; rather, it also depends on processes within the membrane bulk. However, because of the disparity between model and laboratory electrodes for voltage spans and response times, it was concluded that the model was neglecting essential mechanisms such as ion-exchange and water interactions. ...|$|R
40|$|Finely {{resolved}} PM 2. 5 {{exposure measurements}} {{at the level}} of individual participants or over a targeted geographic area can be challenging due to the cost, size and weight of the monitoring equipment. We propose re-purposing the low-cost, portable and lightweight Shinyei PPD 42 NS particle counter as a particle counting device. Previous field deployment of this sensor suggests that it captures trends in ambient PM 2. 5 concentrations, but important characteristics of the sensor response have yet to be determined. Laboratory testing was undertaken in order to characterize performance. The Shinyei sensors, in-line with a TSI Aerosol Particle Sizer (APS) model 3321, tracked particle decay within an aerosol exposure chamber. Test atmospheres were composed of monodisperse polystyrene spheres with diameters of 0. 75, 1, 2 3 and 6 um as well as a polydisperse atmosphere of ASHRAE test dust # 1. Two-minute block averages of the sensor response provide a measurement with low random error, within sensor, for particles in the 0. 75 - 6 μm range with a limit of detection of 1 μg/m 3. The response <b>slope</b> of the <b>sensors</b> is idiomatic, and each sensor requires a unique response curve. A linear model captures the sensor response for concentrations below 50 μg/m 3 and for concentrations above 50 μg/m 3 a non-linear function captures the response and saturates at 800 μg/m 3. The Limit of Detection (LOD) is 1 μg/m 3. The response time is on the order of minutes, making it appropriate for tracking short-term changes in concentration. When paired with prior evaluation, these sensors are appropriate for use as ambient particle counters for low and medium concentrations of respirable particles (< 100 ug/m 3). Multiple sensors deployed over a spatial grid would provide valuable spatio-temporal variability in PM 2. 5 and could be used to validate exposure models. When paired with GPS tracking, these devices have the potential to provide time and space resolved exposure measurements for a large number of participants, thus increasing the power of a study...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecently, Armston et al. (2013) have {{demonstrated}} that a new, physically-based method for direct retrieval of canopy gap probability Pgap from waveform lidar can improve the estimation of Pgap over discrete return lidar data. The success of the approach was demonstrated in a savanna woodland environment in Australia. The huge advantage of this method is that it uses the data themselves to solve for the canopy contrast term i. e. {{the ratio of the}} reflectance from crown and ground, ρv/ρg. In this way the method avoids local calibration that is typically required to overcome differences in either ρv or ρg. To be more generally useful the method must be demonstrated on different sites and in the presence of <b>slope</b> and different <b>sensor</b> and survey configurations. If it is robust to these things, slope in particular, then we would suggest {{it is likely to be}} widely useful. Here, we test the robustness of the retrieval of Pgap from waveform lidar using the Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research dataset, over the Heihe River Basin region of China. The data contain significant canopy, terrain and survey variations, presenting a rather different set of conditions to those previously used. Results show that ρv/ρg is seen to be stable across all flights and for all levels of spatial aggregation. This strongly supports the robustness of the new Pgap retrieval method, which assumes that this relationship is stable. A comparison between Pgap estimated from hemiphotos and from the waveform lidar showed agreement with Pearson correlation coefficient R= 0. 91. The waveform lidar-derived estimates of Pgap agreed to within 8 % of values derived from hemiphotos, with a bias of 0. 17 %. The new waveform model was shown to be stable across different off-nadir scan angles and in the presence of slopes up to 26 ° with R≥ 0. 85 in all cases. We also show that the waveform model can be used to calculate Pgap using just the mean value of canopy returns, assuming that their distribution is unimodal. Lastly, we show that the method can also be applied to discrete return lidar data, albeit with slightly lower accuracy and higher bias, allowing Pgap comparisons with previously-collected lidar datasets. Our results show the new method should be applicable for estimating Pgap robustly across large areas, and from lidar data collected at different times and using different systems; an increasingly important requirement...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, slope {{stability}} analysis {{is fundamental to}} satisfy the increa singly societal demand for safe infrastructures and natural resources. W ith the increase in computational power and the advance in the developme nt of numerical methods, new techniques for {{slope stability}} analysis hav e become very attractive to engineers. The finite element method (FEM) p resents many advantages over classic methods, e. g., no a-priori failure mechanism is necessary to assess the stability of slopes. Furthermore, n umerical techniques provide information about stresses and displacements, what contributes {{to the understanding of}} slope processes. Despite thes e advantages to become the state-of-the-practice method, FEM should be c apable of handling different aspects of slope stability analysis. The aim of this research is twofold. The first objective is to investiga te the application of finite element analysis techniques in slope stabil ity studies and to define ways to enhance its use in practical geotechni cal applications. The second objective is exploring the use of FEM to de tect the precursors to slope failure and to assist in defining the optim al positioning of <b>sensors</b> for <b>slope</b> stability monitoring. The research i n these areas will contribute to a safe and a more economic design of sl opes. The thesis presents a comprehensive and critical literature review on th e state-of-the-art in finite element slope stability analysis, in partic ularly with focus on the strength reduction technique. Static, pseudosta tic and dynamic finite element analyses are conducted to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} method and to demonstrate practical applications. The applications of FEM, that have been developed and validated in this research, encompass: a process to detect different sliding surfaces from performing a finite element analysis, the computation of the critical s lip surface from shear strain contours, and the coupling of FEM with opt imisation algorithms for the back-analysis of soil parameters. Additiona lly, a broad comparative analysis between the classical limit equilibriu m method (LEM) and the FEM with focus on the differences between both me thods is presented. The use of the finite element stress field in a limi t equilibrium context, including the effects of the tensile strength and dilatancy is also investigated. The results, in terms of the factor of safety and the location of the critical slip surface have been compared against the output of classical slope stability methods. The FEM is a ro bust method, giving values for the factor of safety lower than classical methods and determining the location of the critical slip surface accur ately. Prior to the dynamic finite element analysis an overview of the pseudost atic method is given. The determination of the critical seismic coeffici ent by finite elements has been presented and a terminology for this pro cess is introduced namely stress increase method. The finite element res ults of the seismic coefficient are compared to those obtained by the li mit equilibrium and the limit analysis method. For the dynamic finite element analysis, a parametric analysis, using a harmonic motion, is performed to detect the effect of the frequency, pea k ground acceleration, duration, soil properties, and slope geometry. Th e effect on the slope stability of each parameter is assessed by identif ying the vertical displacement of the top of the slope. Actual earthquak e records are also used to assess the stability of the slope and the res ults are compared against those calculated by the Newmark method. Two ap proaches to enhance the Newmark displacements are suggested. The first o ne is based on the modification of the input acceleration and the second on the change of the acceleration coefficient. Potential unstable zones are evaluated and possible locations to install monitoring sensors are proposed. The FEM is used to predict the critica l displacements (total, horizontal and vertical) in a case study and the results are used to guide the instrumentation setup. This procedure has been used to detect early signs of failure and a better understanding o f the mechanism of movement. The proposed methodologies to use the FEM for practical problems have be en validated, demonstrating the applicability of finite elements to asse ss the stability of slopes for several situations and conditions. 1 General introduction 1 1. 1 The importance of slope stability assessment 1 1. 2 General aspects in landslide analysis 2 1. 3 Scope of Research 5 1. 3. 1 Solution strategy and original contributions 7 1. 4 Organisation of the dissertation 8 2 Methods for slope stability analysis 11 2. 1 Introduction 11 2. 2 Methods of analysis 12 2. 3 Limit equilibrium method 14 2. 3. 1 General considerations of LEM 15 2. 3. 2 Unified formulation for LEM. 16 2. 3. 3 Bishop’s simplified method 17 2. 3. 4 Limit equilibrium variational calculus 19 2. 4 Limit analysis method 20 2. 5 Numerical methods for slope stability 23 2. 6 Limitations and advantages of LEM compared to FEM 25 2. 6. 1 Limitations of the LEM 25 2. 6. 2 Limitations of FEM for slope stability analysis 25 2. 6. 3 Advantages of FEM over conventional methods 26 2. 7 Other slope stability methods 26 2. 8 Location of the critical slip surface 27 2. 8. 1 Slip surface optimisation 28 2. 8. 2 Physical admissibility of the solution 28 2. 9 Important aspects in slope stability analysis 29 2. 9. 1 Factor of safety 29 2. 9. 2 Criteria for the selection of the design factor of safety 30 2. 9. 3 Reliability analysis in slope stability 36 2. 9. 4 Safety map 36 2. 9. 5 Stability number 37 2. 9. 6 Effect of dilatancy on slope stability 38 2. 10 Conclusions 39 3 Finite element method for slope stability analysis 41 3. 1 Introduction 41 3. 2 Considerations in finite element analysis 42 3. 3 Literature review 43 3. 4 Mathematical formulation 57 3. 4. 1 Finite element discretisation 58 3. 4. 2 Implicit integration of differential plasticity models 59 3. 5 Strength reduction technique 61 3. 5. 1 Factor of safety definition in FE-SRM 61 3. 5. 2 Mathematical formulation for SRM 62 3. 6 Finite element slope stability analysis 63 3. 6. 1 Discretisation of the model 64 3. 6. 2 Initial state of stress 64 3. 6. 3 Strength reduction process 66 3. 6. 4 Failure mechanisms detection 67 3. 7 Comparative analysis between FEM and LEM 69 3. 7. 1 Numerical model and results 69 3. 8 Detection of local failures by FE-SRM 81 3. 8. 1 Example 1, benched slope 81 3. 8. 2 Example 2, two-slope-angles 84 3. 8. 3 Example 3, complex slope configuration 86 3. 8. 4 Discussion on determination of local failures 87 3. 9 Determination of the CSS from FE-SRM 88 3. 9. 1 Numerical examples and verification 89 3. 9. 2 Discussion on the determination of the CSS 95 3. 10 Conclusions 96 4 Enhanced limit method for slope stability analysis 99 4. 1 Introduction 99 4. 2 Enhanced limit method 100 4. 2. 1 Factor of safety definition in ELM 100 4. 2. 2 Scheme of enhanced limit method 102 4. 2. 3 Search for the critical slip surface 103 4. 3 Applications of the enhanced limit method 103 4. 3. 1 Application 2 H: 1 V slope 103 4. 3. 2 Discussion on the applicability of the results 105 4. 3. 3 Reduced strength cases, 2 H: 1 V slope 108 4. 3. 4 Application 1 H: 2 V slope 109 4. 4 Conclusions 112 5 Dynamic finite element analysis for slope stability 115 5. 1 Introduction 115 5. 2 Seismic instability in soil slopes 116 5. 3 Pseudostatic analysis 117 5. 3. 1 Selection of the design seismic coefficient 118 5. 3. 2 Critical seismic coefficient 120 5. 3. 3 Comments on pseudostatic approach 124 5. 3. 4 Determination of kc by different methods 125 5. 4 Displacement based analysis 128 5. 4. 1 Newmark method 129 5. 5 Time integration FEM 131 5. 5. 1 Boundary and initial conditions 131 5. 6 Parametric study for dynamic assessment 135 5. 6. 1 Effect of ground motion input 136 5. 6. 2 Effect of soil properties 143 5. 6. 3 Effect of slope geometry 147 5. 6. 4 Discussion on parametric study 152 5. 7 Dynamic earthquake analysis 153 5. 7. 1 Elastic response spectrum analysis 153 5. 7. 2 Newmark and FE displacements 159 5. 8 Conclusions 166 6 Slope stability monitoring 169 6. 1 Introduction 169 6. 2 Slope stability monitoring 169 6. 3 <b>Slope</b> monitoring <b>sensors</b> 171 6. 4 Presentation of case study 176 6. 4. 1 Site description 176 6. 4. 2 Geology and geotechnical characteristics 176 6. 4. 3 Finite element model 178 6. 4. 4 Location of the critical displacements 180 6. 4. 5 Slope stability analysis of case study 180 6. 4. 6 Comparison between FEM and LEM results 193 6. 4. 7 Parametric study on cohesion and friction angle, Case 1 194 6. 5 Conclusions 196 7 Back analysis of soil parameters 197 7. 1 Introduction 197 7. 2 Back analysis of strength parameters 198 7. 2. 1 Conventional procedure for back analysis 200 7. 2. 2 Optimisation problem 202 7. 2. 3 Numerical examples 203 7. 3 Back analysis of soil parameters for seepage problem 221 7. 3. 1 Groundwater flow formulation 221 7. 3. 2 Site description Fosso S.
