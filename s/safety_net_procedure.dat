In turn, this has generated interest in the design of prudential regulations and <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> <b>procedures</b> for banks. In this paper the thesis is advanced that the two must be treated as interdependent and not substitutes. A capital adequacy requirement ensures that there is a buffer against a decline in the value of bank assets. However, it does not eliminate the possibility of runs. On the other hand, deposit insurance creates a moral hazard problem which can best be limited by setting appropriate capital requirements and risk weights...|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} of bank behaviour which identifies the factors determining a bank's optimal capital/asset ratio, its optimal liquidity ratio, the expected value of non-performing loans and {{the probability of}} bank failure. We propose that this last variable can act as an index of bank credit-worthiness. The main factors determining this index are (i) the risk associated with bank asset returns, (ii) the variability of bank deposits, (iii) {{the costs associated with}} bank failure and (iv) the implicit or explicit government subsidy involved in depositor protection schemes. The principal general conclusion of the paper is that regulations governing capital requirements, liquidity requirements and depositor protection should be (a) risk related and (b) integrated. Depositor protection can be improved through relatively high capital requirements. However, the optimal strategy is for all bank <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> <b>procedures</b> and incentive mechanisms {{to be related to the}} riskiness of individual bank portfolios. capital adequacy requirements, deposit guarantees, limited liability.

40|$|Background: Acute {{infection}} {{is the most}} common presentation of children to ambulatory care. In contrast, serious infections are rare and often present at an early stage. To avoid complications or death, early recognition and adequate referral are essential. In a recent large study children were included prospectively to construct a symptom-based decision tree with a sensitivity and negative predictive value of nearly 100 %. To reduce the number of false positives, point-of-care (POC) tests might be useful, providing an immediate result at the bedside. The most probable candidate is C-reactive protein. Every clinician should reassure anxious parents of children with self-limiting illnesses. The improvement of diagnostic algorithms, the addition of technological devices and the sensible use of <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> <b>procedures</b> could improve prognosis of seriously ill children. Methods: First, we externally validated clinical prediction rules, identified by a systematic review, in 7 urgent-access datasets, as well as comparing these results to recent findings in other studies. After zooming in on the diagnostic value of the clinical prediction rules based on vital signs with potential to differentiate serious infections from the majority of self-limiting illnesses in an inpatient paediatric setting in the UK, we focused our analyses on the temporal & geographic validation of the decision tree based on signs and symptoms in a new but similar population in Flanders. We examined the analytical accuracy and user-friendliness of a POC test after careful selection of a device that meets all our requirements. Finally we explored the added value of the selected POC CRP test in a prospective diagnostic accuracy study in three different ambulatory care settings: general practice, outpatient paediatric clinic, and the emergency department. Results: In low to intermediate prevalence settings the 4 -step decisionnbsp;and evidence-based guidelines had high sensitivity, providing promising rule-out value for serious infections in 7 datasets. The paediatrician’s overall illness assessment was the most useful feature to rule in sepsis or meningitis in a study of hospitalized children. Temporal validation of the 4 -step decision tree indicated that this practical tool for diagnostic triage of acutely ill children in primary care is valid and ready to be implemented in routine care, if appropriate <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> or additional testing is applied. The selected POC CRP test was accurate in children and should be considered reliable and user-friendly. Adding point-of-care CRP test results to the 4 -step decision tree helped identifying serious infections in the GP setting and can potentially reduce the number of investigations and admissions in children with non-serious infections. I propose a new decision tree to be used in specialist settings as a triage instrument to safely rule out serious infections. Discussion: The incidence of serious infections has declined over the past few years, amongst other reasons, due to vaccination strategies and improvements in neonatal care. Before a clinical prediction rule can be implemented in routine care, it has to go through several stages of development and testing. A single test will never reach perfect sensitivity and specificity in real life. To tackle the ever-present clinical uncertainty, physicians often put a <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> in place, informing parents when to re-contact and which alarm signs are relevant to monitor. I put an emphasis on these issues and offer a perspective for future developments in the field of point-of-care testing in serious infections in paediatric primary care. nrpages: 186 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Acute {{illness is}} common in childhood, and it is {{difficult}} for healthcare professionals to distinguish seriously ill children from the vast majority with minor or self-limiting illnesses. <b>Safety</b> <b>netting</b> provides parents with advice on when and where to return if their child deteriorates, and it is widely recommended that parents of acutely sick young children should be given <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> advice. Yet little is known about how and when this is given. We aimed to understand what <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> advice first contact clinicians give parents of acutely sick young children, how, when, and why. METHODS: This was a qualitative study. Interviews and focus groups were held with doctors and nurses in a general practice surgery, a District General Hospital emergency department, a paediatric emergency department, and an out-of-hours service. Data were analysed using the method of constant comparison. RESULTS: Sixteen clinicians participated. They described that <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> advice includes advising parents what to look for, when and where to seek help. How <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> was delivered and whether it was verbal or written was inconsistent, and no participants described being trained in this area. <b>Safety</b> <b>netting</b> appeared to be rarely documented, and was left to individual preference. Limitations of written materials, and structural barriers to the provision of <b>safety</b> <b>netting,</b> were perceived. Participants described that <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> was influenced by clinicians' experience, confidence, time and knowledge; and perceived parental anxiety, experience, and competence. Participants noted several limitations to <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> including not knowing if it has been understood by parents or been effective; parental difficulty interpreting information and desire for face-to-face reassurance; and potential over-reassurance. CONCLUSION: First contact clinicians employ a range of <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> techniques, with inconsistencies within and between organisations. Structural changes, clinician training, and documentation in patient notes may improve <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> provision. Research is needed into the optimal components of <b>safety</b> <b>netting</b> advice so that clinicians can consistently deliver the most effective advice for parents.

In this sense, one might say the change in the equity-efficiency tradeoff mediated through an expanded <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> was a major factor contracting the labor market after 2007.|$|R

While <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> {{are intended}} to confer benefits on the macroeconomy, their design and implementation may confer disproportionate benefits on identifiable sectors, such as banks and depositors. In this study, we distinguish between <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> benefits and subsidies. Regardless of whether privately or publicly provided, risk-sharing financial services routinely provide benefits without subsidies. Subsidies arise here when the government misprices the financial services that it provides. We show how these government subsidies are typically shared by banks and their customers and typically lead to resource misallocation. We also discuss how existing estimates correspond to the benefits and subsidies associated with <b>safety</b> <b>nets.</b> Analysts have long pointed to the ‘traditional triad ” (deposit insurance, the discount window, and the electronic payments system) as the major sources of <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> subsidies to banking. We argue {{that the value of}} <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> subsidies to banking has shifted by notable amounts and in different directions over the past two decades. Significant financial secto...|$|R
40|$|Farmers in {{developing}} countries are reluctant to make investments for fear of failure and the economic distress resulting from this, but the perception of protection by a <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> may induce farmers to invest by reducing that fear. Using Cambodian farm household data, this paper examines factors affecting the perception of protection by a <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> and then assesses {{the effect of this}} perception on farmers' investment. For empirical analyses, perceived credit availability from relatives represents this perceived safety net; and chemical fertilizer input signifies the investment size. The results of the econometric analysis demonstrate that farm households with higher economic status, who are able to repay a loan or favour, are more likely to perceive such a <b>safety</b> <b>net.</b> It is also shown that the <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> perception positively affects chemical fertilizer input, implying that farmers accept risk when they perceive a <b>safety</b> <b>net.</b> These findings suggest that it is not only a lack of capital that deters poor households from investment, but also the perceived lack of a <b>safety</b> <b>net.</b> ...|$|R

It presents a description of the methodology used for compiling the inventories and analyses by region, type of intervention involved, sector board, and instrument. The World Bank has engaged with 118 countries on <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> issues over the six years under review, providing lending in 68, analytic products in 86, training in 87, and a combined package of all three services in 42, demonstrating the increased sophistication and the important role of <b>safety</b> <b>nets</b> in social policy. There is noticeable variability over time as the portfolio and analytic effort expand when large or multiple countries face economic crises. The regional distribution of <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> activities shows the dominance of Latin America. The analysis also shows the diversity within the portfolio, with respect to both the type of intervention supported and the range of sectors involved in <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> work. Finally, the report delineates the implications and outlook for the future. <b>Safety</b> <b>Nets</b> and Transfers,Banks&Banking Reform,,Labor Policies,Debt Markets...|$|R
