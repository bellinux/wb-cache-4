40|$|Bamboo {{is viewed}} as a {{sustainable}} and highly renewable material that may be grown in any temperate climate zone. Interest in the engineering properties of bamboo and the use of bamboo in engineered construction is growing. Although often having superior mechanical properties than readily available sawn timber, bamboo, being largely an unidirectional fibrous material, is very susceptible to longitudinal splitting. Despite being the dominant limit state in many applications, very little previous work has addressed the characterization of bamboo splitting failure. The present research focuses on the development of a <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> test method for characterizing the splitting strength of bamboo culms. The proposed <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> test uses a full culm section test, thereby eliminating some of the complexities of partial culm tests. Results of a pilot study of the <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> test having similar specimens with different <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> diameters yielded consistent results and variations less than that of the previously standardized direct shear test. In order to demonstrate the validity of the proposed test method, a series of tests was performed on samples of Tre Gai (Bambusa stenostachya Hackel) bamboo. Â© 2010 ASCE...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Split</b> <b>pins</b> are {{frequently}} used to secure other fasteners, e.g. clevis pins, {{as well as}} being used in combination with hardboard discs as a traditional joining technique for teddy bears. A common application of this is when used to secure a castellated nut.|$|E
50|$|In {{applications}} where vibration or rotation {{may work}} a nut loose, various locking mechanisms may be employed: lock washers, jam nuts, specialist adhesive thread-locking fluid such as Loctite, safety pins (<b>split</b> <b>pins)</b> or lockwire {{in conjunction with}} castellated nuts, nylon inserts (nyloc nut), or slightly oval-shaped threads.|$|E
50|$|A split pin, {{also known}} in the United States as a cotter pin or cotter key, is a metal {{fastener}} with two tines that are bent during installation, similar to a staple or rivet.

50|$|A brass {{fastener}}, brad, paper fastener or {{split pin}} is a stationery item used for securing multiple {{sheets of paper}} together.A patent of the fastener was issued in 1866 to George W McGill.The fastener is inserted into punched holes in the stack of paper, and the leaves, or tines, of the legs are separated and bent over to secure the paper. This holds the pin in place and the sheets of paper together. For few sheets of paper, holes can be made using the sharp end of the fastener. A split pin {{may be used in}} place of staples, but they are more commonly used in situations where rotation around the joint is desirable. This lends <b>split</b> <b>pins</b> to use in mobile paper and cardboard models.It is shaped somewhat like a nail with a round head and flat, split length. Brass fasteners are made of a soft metal such as brass and the tines are typically of two slightly different lengths. This allows easy separation of the tines.A brass fastener is similar in design and function to the mechanical counterpart <b>split</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|E

50|$|A pin shackle {{is closed}} with an anchor bolt and cotter pin, {{in a manner}} similar to a clevis. It is for this reason they are often {{referred}} to, in industrial jargon, as clevises. Pin shackles can be inconvenient to work with, at times, as the bolt will need to be secured to the shackle body to avoid its loss, usually with a <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> or seizing wire. A more secure version used in crane rigging features the combination of a securing nut (hardware) located alongside the cotter pin. Pin shackles are practical in many rigging applications where the anchor bolt is expected to experience some rotation.|$|R

50|$|As shown above, {{there are}} {{different}} types of ends available on <b>split</b> <b>pins.</b> The most common is the extended prong with a square cut, but extended prongs are available {{with all of the}} other types of ends. The extended prong type is popular because it makes it easier to separate the tines. To ease insertion into a hole the longer tine may be slightly curved to overlap the tip of the shorter tine or it is beveled. The length, L, of the split pin is defined as the distance {{from the end of the}} shortest tine to the point of the eyelet that contacts the hole.|$|E
50|$|On 20 May 2013, ET 3309 derailed {{crossing}} Wellington Distant Junction, puncturing {{a hole in}} the floor. It was {{the rear}} car in a two-unit consist operating the 07:43 Porirua to Wellington service, subsequently stranding thousands of morning peak commuters across the network as it blocked both the Kapiti and Hutt Valley lines. All units were temporarily withdrawn after the derailment for urgent safety inspections, but most were back in service for morning peak the next day. Preliminary investigations suggest when one of the unit's spring park brake assemblies was replaced in March 2013, two <b>split</b> <b>pins</b> were not inserted into the bolts securing the assembly to the undercarriage, allowing the assembly to come loose over time and ultimately caused the derailment. Two air reservoir tanks came loose in the accident and pushed the air compressor behind them upwards through the floor, creating the hole.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of clevis pins: {{threaded}} and unthreaded. Unthreaded clevis pins have a domed head {{at one end and}} a cross-hole at the other end. A cotter pin (USA usage) or <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> is used to keep the clevis pin in place. Threaded clevis pins have a partially threaded shank on one end and a formed head on the other. The formed head has a lip, which acts as a stop when threading the pin into the shackle, and a flattened tab with a cross-hole. The flattened tab allows for easy installation of the pin and the cross-hole allows the pin to be moused.|$|R
5000|$|A clevis {{fastener}} is a three-piece fastener system {{consisting of}} a clevis, clevis pin, and tang. The clevis is a U-shaped piece that has holes {{at the end of}} the prongs to accept the clevis pin. The clevis pin is similar to a bolt, but is only partially threaded or unthreaded with a cross-hole for a <b>split</b> <b>pin.</b> The tang is a piece that fits in the space within the clevis and is held in place by the clevis pin. [...] The combination of a simple clevis fitted with a pin is commonly called a shackle, although a clevis and pin is only one of the many forms a shackle may take.|$|R

50|$|Contrary {{to popular}} misconception, {{wobbling}} will not cause a ceiling fan to fall. Ceiling fans are secured by clevis pins locked with either <b>split</b> <b>pins</b> or R-clips, so wobbling won't {{have an effect}} on the fan's security, unless of course, the pins/clips were not secured. To date, there are no reports of a fan wobbling itself off the ceiling and falling. However, a severe wobble can cause light fixture shades or covers to gradually loosen over time and potentially fall, posing a risk of injury to anyone under the fan, and also from any resulting broken glass. It is also worth mentioning that when the MythBusters were designing a fan with the goal of chopping off someone's head, Scottie used an edge finder to find the exact center of their blades with the aim of eliminating potentially very dangerous wobbling of their steel blades. It is important that, when installing the fan, the installer closely follows the manufacturer's instructions with regard to using proper mounting screws. It is also important that all screws (especially the set screws which hold twist-on downrods in place) be tight, and any ceiling fan light fixtures are properly assembled with their shades and covers securely attached.|$|E
50|$|The {{realized}} films had 300 to 700 transparent {{pictures of}} successive phases of moving figures with black backgrounds. The pictures were hand painted by Reynaud in aniline inks directly on 6 x 6 cm gelatin plates. The plates were coated with shellac and framed {{in a cardboard}} strip of which the sides were clad in fabric bands attached with <b>split</b> <b>pins.</b> The horizontal film strip could be up to 50 meters long, with black leader tape at the beginning. Central perforations in the cardboard between the images engaged with metal notches protruding from a large central turning wheel. The wheel transferred the strip between two copper 25 cm spools. The film was guided further by pinch rollers {{at the corners of}} the table and passed in front of a magic lantern. The magic lantern projected each image in turn towards one of the 36 rectangular mirrors {{at the center of the}} turning wheel. Each image was in turn reflected to another mirror, which reflected it through a focusing lens towards a movable mirror. The movable mirror could be adjusted to project the moving characters at the desired place within an immobile background image on the screen. The background was projected with a second magic lantern from a painted glass plate. Reynaud would manipulate the speed of the film by hand and repeat movements to produce a visual story that could last longer than 10 minutes. The projectionist operated the machine behind the screen, with only the projection visible to the audience.|$|E
5000|$|Watchstraps or bracelets for diving watches are {{generally}} made of {{materials that are}} adequately water (pressure) resistant and able to endure the galvanic corrosiveness of seawater. In practical terms most diving watches feature a rubber, silicone rubber, polyurethane or fabric watchstrap or a stainless steel or titanium metal link or mesh bracelet of adequate length to facilitate wearing the watch over a diving suit sleeve.For a wrist with a 200 mm circumference wearing a 4 mm thick diving suit sleeve increases the strap or bracelet length required the fit the watch over the sleeved wrist to 225 mm. For this bracelets often have a (concealed) divers extension [...] clasp by which the bracelet can be appropriately extended by approximately 20 mm to 30 mm.Some watchstraps allow an increase in length by adding a diving suit extension strap piece to the standard watchstrap. If required more than one diving suit extension strap piece {{can be added to}} the standard watchstrap.With increasing depth and rising water pressure the (sleeved) wrist of a diver is exposed to compression effects that have a shrinking effect on the wrist circumference. Many watchstraps intended for diving watches have rippled or vented sections near the attachment points on the watch case to facilitate the required flexibility to strap the watch tightly for normal wear at the surface whilst keeping the watch sufficiently tightly in place on the divers wrist at depth.Metal link bracelets theoretically have more failure points compared to metal mesh bracelets and watchstraps due to the use of link connection parts like <b>split</b> <b>pins</b> or screw pins. One piece (NATO style) nylon fabric straps that slide under the watch case through both spring bars (or attaching points between the watch case and strap) are used to minimize the chance of losing the watch due to a spring bar or attachment point failure.|$|E

During the latter operation, one of the two Seakings (Shark 02) embarked on HMAS Kanimbla, crashed on the Island of Nias with the loss of nine personnel. The accident occurred as a result of a series of maintenance errors, specifically the incorrect re-fitting of a nut and <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> during maintenance performed on the aircraft some two months before the crash. Deficiencies in maintenance practices, training, support and logistics operations within the Navy were also identified as contributing factors. Following the accident, several major changes were made to maintenance and safety management practices at 817 Squadron.|$|R
