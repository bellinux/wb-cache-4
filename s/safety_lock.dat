25|$|Most bonnets {{are joined}} to the corselet by 1/8th turn {{interrupted}} thread. The helmet neck thread is placed onto {{the neck of}} the corselet facing the divers left front, where the threads do not engage, and then rotated forward, engaging the thread and seating on a leather gasket to make a watertight seal. The helmet usually has a <b>safety</b> <b>lock</b> which prevents the bonnet from rotating back and separating underwater. Other styles of connection are also used, with the joint secured by clamps or bolts (usually three). Some helmets were made with the bonnet and corselet in one piece and secured to the suit in other ways.|$|E
500|$|On 8 November 1940 his Spitfire {{was badly}} damaged during a {{skirmish}} with several Bf 109s over Beachy Head in East Sussex. The Spitfire was so badly damaged that Lock crash-landed in a ploughed field, but {{was able to}} walk away. On 17 November 1940 No. 41 Squadron attacked a formation of 70 Bf 109s that were top cover for a bomber raid on London. After shooting down one Bf 109, and setting another on fire, Lock's Spitfire {{was hit by a}} volley of cannon shells, which severely injured Lock's right arm and both legs. The rounds also knocked the throttle permanently open by severing the control lever. The open throttle enabled the Spitfire to accelerate swiftly to , leaving the Bf 109s in his wake, without Lock having to attempt to operate it with his injured right arm.

A second [...] "American" [...] emblem was applied over the front edge of the hood on the right corner. The two-point seatbelts were replaced by fixed three-point units on both sedan models. Wagons included three-point retractable units as factory issue. The Carter RBS carburetor was discontinued leaving only the YF model on the 258 six. Two-door sedans with the manual transmissions now featured a floor-mounted gearshift with low-back fold-down individual seats, while models with automatic transmissions retained the bench seat with split folding backs and a column-mounted shifter. This also meant manual units incorporated a <b>safety</b> <b>lock</b> lever in their steering column ignition switch shared with American Rally model. The seats and door panels were slightly modified from the last year. A new [...] "American" [...] emblem with different typography was applied to glove box door.
