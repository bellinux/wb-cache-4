The New Republic at the time attributed the quotation to US Air Force Major Chester L. Brown. In Walter Cronkite's 1971 book, Eye on the World, Arnett reasserted that the quotation was something [...] "one American major said to me in a moment of revelation." ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{the assault}} {{attempts}} failed, Russia's Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov and Federal Security Service (FSB) Director Mikhail Barsukov {{declared that the}} hostage-takers had executed the captives. FSB General Alexander Mikhailov announced that the Chechens [...] "had shot or hanged all or most" [...] of the hostages, and federal forces now planned to [...] "flatten" [...] Pervomayskoye; Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin also claimed that no hostages remained alive. Russian commanders then ordered their forces to open fire on the village with mortars, howitzers and rocket launchers. American correspondent Michael Specter reported that the Russians were [...] "firing into Pervomaskoye {{at the rate of}} one a minute - the same Grad missiles they used to largely destroy the Chechen capital Grozny when the conflict began." [...] Specter noted: [...] "The Grads fell with monstrous concussive force throughout the day. In this town, about four miles away, where journalists have been herded by Russian forces, windows cracked at the force of the repeated blasts ... Mikhailov <b>said</b> <b>today</b> that <b>he</b> was adding up the Chechen casualties, not by number of corpses, 'but by the number of arms and legs.'" [...] Barsukov later joked that [...] "the usage of the Grad multiple rocket launchers was mainly psychological", and CNN reported that [...] "the general's answers were openly mocking." [...] Among Russian troops deployed to the village was an FSB agent from Nalchik, Alexander Litvinenko, whose ad-hoc squad came under friendly fire from Grad rockets. Heavy losses (including friendly-fire incidents) triggered a collapse in morale among the Russian forces. Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer reported that [...] "based on information from observers and participants of the fighting, it can be concluded that Interior Ministry officers {{were on the verge of}} mutiny." [...] It was reported that demoralized, cold and hungry Russian troops begged the locals for alcohol and cigarettes in exchange for ammunition.|$|R

Robert Laurence of The San Diego Union-Tribune wrote: [...] "Messing and McCormack play wonderfully together, tossing lines {{back and forth as}} if they'd been at it for years, making their relationship quite believable. Sean Hayes, as the flamboyantly gay Jack, adds to the mix. Jack is flighty, temperamental, good-humored and highly likable." [...] A reviewer for USA <b>Today</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> thought {{it would be nice to}} see Will have a [...] "full life of his own", and not just serve as a [...] "love-life adviser" [...] to Grace and Jack.
