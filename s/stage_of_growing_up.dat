Struggles with being treated like a grown man {{when he is not}} quite ready for it. That being said, he is quite horny. Can drive. Works for a lawn mowing business. Sort of the [...] "cool kid in town." [...] He is older so he can drive and he can go on the roller coaster, that Charlie is too young to ride. At the end of the show, the {{audience}} finds out he is moving to Canada - for good. Although Charlie and Ted fight, the audience can feel the heart-wrenching moment between the two boys when Ted announces his move.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{presented}} theses is {{to discover}} and to compare the impacts of the education on {{the children in the}} preschool care and on the schoolchildren (teen-agers) as far as the acquiring of the basis of the Christianity as a religion and the formation of their life as Christians. In principle the corn of the theses lies in the assessment of the influence of different factors (as the family, friends, priest, Christian broadcasting, literature, participation of the parish activities) on the Christian faith of children and young people. In other words, whether the formation of the Christian life gained through the family (from birth up) has a more stabile and permanent experiences with God than the faith acquired at a later <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> The methods of testing, of questionnaire survey and the method of monitoring the behaviour of children and young people were used in the theses. The outcome of my research was the finding, that even if some adolescents have an interest in the matters of faith and God, this meeting with the religion does not form deep relationships to the faith as such and to the God. Only by a slight number of the young people has such a late cognition an influence on the formation of their future Christian life. By contrast, the acquiring of the Christian faith from the childhood on has other difficulties. The Christian faith of children faces the misunderstanding of classmates and later on of an atheist partner. Fort the maintenance of the faith of the adolescents the factors like family values, stand-points and patterns are of special importance...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of risky behavior is characteristic in adolescence. Of {{all forms of}} risky behavior in adolescence, the use of psychoactive substances - cigarettes, alcohol and illegal psychoactive substances particularly stand out, because of the frequency and degree of prevalence of use, {{and because of the}} impact that they have on youth development in this sensitive <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> Unfortunately, today we are witnessing the fact that such behavior in adolescents has gained an increasingly epidemic character mainly due to the characteristics of the social context in which young people are growing up. The main objective of this research, conducted in the framework of the doctoral dissertation of the author, was determining relations between relevant sociodemographic factors: gender, age, school success, financial status and place of residence of respondents, with the appearance and intensity of use of three types of psychoactive substances - cigarettes, alcohol and illegal psychoactive substances among the general population of adolescents. The sample represents non-clinical young population, and it consists of 529 adolescents, students of the 2 nd and 4 th class of secondary school (17 and 18 years old). The data was collected by using Scale use of PAS (psychoactive substances) in adolescents, which was designed {{for the purpose of this}} research, as well as using a set of questions intended for the registration of socio-demographic variables. Respondents filled in questionnaires in groups, during the school lessons. The data show a relationship between the three studied socio-demographic variables with the occurrence and degree of use of psychoactive substances in the adolescence period, such as gender, age and school success of the respondents. As regards gender of respondents associated with the occurrence and degree of alcohol and illegal substance use in adolescents, male adolescents more likely use alcohol and illegal psychoactive substances. Age of respondents associated with the use of all three types of psychoactive substances in adolescence, found that older adolescents were more likely to use cigarettes, alcohol and illegal psychoactive substances. School success of the respondents is associated with the occurrence and degree of use of all three tested categories of psychoactive substances - cigarettes, alcohol and drugs, and the obtained findings indicate that with the decline in school success, the prevalence of all three types of psychoactive substances increases in adolescence. Besides the theoretical significance, the applicability of the findings is reflected in the field of primary prevention and health protection of youth...|$|E
40|$|Parenting {{can be very}} {{difficult}} at times, and even more challenging for someone trying {{to raise a child}} (or children) on their own. There are many different reasons why women become single mothers and this can either be by choice or by chance. Either way, mothers have to make many sacrifices in order to “do it all”. These women usually have one source of income and half the time to spend with their children. After doing some research, I found the bonding with the mother and the child at birth, as well as different <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up,</b> can be very life changing. The role a mother has in a single parent position is more difficult than it would be with a partner...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{establish}} whether any relation exists between depression symptoms and the extent to which adolescents accept the changes their bodies undergo (the physical changes they experience at different <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up),</b> and if the connection does exist - is it gender-related. Method: Data were collected from four sub-groups: younger girls (aged 12 - 13), older girls (aged 17 - 18), younger boys (aged 12 - 13), and older boys (aged 17 - 18). The participants were asked to complete questionnaires that allow to measure the subjective intensity of depression symptoms (BDI), the current <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> biological changes (the Tanner scale) and whether these changes are accepted by the individual who experiences them (the original Feelings Towards the Body questionnaire). Results: The less adolescents accept the changes in their bodies, the higher depression symptoms they demonstrate. For younger girls, older girls and older boys, no links were established between levels of accepting bodily changes and early/late maturation (in comparison with the population of their peers). For younger boys, the later the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> their development, the less likely they are to accept the changes in their bodies. Girls report more intense depression symptoms than boys do, but their levels of accepting changes that occur around puberty are significantly lower only when compared to those of older boys. Conclusions: Whether biological changes during puberty (mainly feelings of anxiety and shame related to the body) are accepted or not, was proven to be a significant predictor of more intense depression symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Mother~child {{relation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} remarkable biological, psychological, social and inter~dependent relation existing in the sphere of human bondage and social matrix. The paramount importance of the relation is not only from the fact that it is the basis of continuation of human race but it is what makes a future human being in terms of his/her personality, value system, citizen and mental health etc. The efforts on the part of the mother to bring up the child from the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> conception to <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> him/her in a state of fully biological autonomous system is a long process and not without paying the cost in terms of time, energy, psychological, emotional and social price. The whole process is not just a smooth transition but is a path in which price has to be paid in unusnal type of currency. Pregnancy is a unique period in the life of a woman. The latest researches are not very far off when the woman may produce child without sexual intercourse and even artificial insemination. Biotechnology is on the brink of such achievements in which mother's ova and father's sperm could meet, without mating or even seeing each other and the baby may have his/her embryonic period in complex chemicals and tube...|$|R
5000|$|The band's third studio album, Beneath the Remains, was {{released}} in 1989. The album was recorded in a rustic studio in Rio de Janeiro while the band communicated through translators with the American producer Scott Burns. It was an immediate success and became known in thrash metal circles as a classic {{on the order of}} Slayer's Reign in Blood. It is hailed by Terrorizer magazine as one of the all-time top 20 thrash metal albums, as well as a gaining a place in their all-time top 40 death metal records. AllMusic gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5 and said, [...] "The complete absence of filler here makes this one of the most essential death/thrash metal albums of all time." [...] A long European and American tour furthered the band's reputation, {{despite the fact that they}} were still very limited English speakers. Their first US show was held on October 31, 1989 at the Ritz in New York City, opening for Danish heavy metal band King Diamond. The band filmed its first video for the single [...] "Inner Self". Traveling on trains. Getting beat up by cops. Sleeping behind the <b>stage.</b> It's part <b>of</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> It's part <b>of</b> the nature of this stuff. If you don't have that kind of background, you can't be a band like us. Max Cavalera reflecting on Sepultura's past in Brazil. In January 1991, Sepultura played for more than 100,000 people at the Rock in Rio II festival. The band relocated from their native Brazil to Phoenix, Arizona in 1990, obtained new management, and recorded the album Arise at Morrisound Studios in Tampa, Florida. By the time the album {{was released}} in 1991, the band had become one of the most critically praised thrash/death metal bands of the time. The first single [...] "Dead Embryonic Cells" [...] was a success, and the title track gained additional attention when its video was banned by MTV America due to its apocalyptic religious imagery. The album was critically acclaimed and their first to chart on the Billboard 200, reaching No. 119.|$|R
