5|$|The main or primary bronchi {{enter the}} lungs at the hilum and {{initially}} branch into secondary bronchi {{also known as}} lobar bronchi that <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> to each lobe of the lung. The lobar bronchi branch into tertiary bronchi also known as segmental bronchi and these <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> to the further divisions of the lobes known as bronchopulmonary segments. Each bronchopulmonary segment has its own (segmental) bronchus and arterial supply. Segments for {{the left and right}} lung are shown in the table. The segmental anatomy is useful clinically for localising disease processes in the lungs. A segment is a discrete unit that can be surgically removed without seriously affecting surrounding tissue.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{respiratory}} tract {{is part of the}} respiratory system, and consists of the trachea and the structures below this including the lungs. The trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to a place where it splits (the carina) into a right and left bronchus. These <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> to the right and left lungs, splitting progressively into the secondary and tertiary bronchi for the lobes of the lungs, and into smaller and smaller bronchioles until they become the respiratory bronchioles. These in turn <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> through alveolar ducts into the alveoli, where the exchange of gases take place. Oxygen breathed in, diffuses through the walls of the alveoli into the enveloping capillaries and into the circulation, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the lungs to be breathed out.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} the air forced through the phonic lips is the right nasal passage. While the left nasal passage opens to the blow hole, the right nasal passage has evolved to <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> to the phonic lips. It is thought that the {{nostrils}} of the land-based ancestor of the sperm whale migrated through evolution to their current functions, the left nostril becoming the blowhole and the right nostril becoming the phonic lips.|$|E

5|$|The trachea and bronchi {{form the}} tracheobronchial tree. The trachea is {{situated}} between {{the lower end}} of the larynx and the center of the chest, where it splits into the two bronchi at a ridge called the carina. The trachea is stabilized and kept open by rings made of cartilage that surround the front and sides of the structure; these rings are not closed and do not surround the back, which is made of membrane. The bronchi split into smaller branches and then to bronchioles that <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> to the alveoli, the tiny air-filled sacs in the lungs responsible for absorbing oxygen. An arbitrary division can be made between the intrathoracic and cervical trachea at the thoracic inlet, an opening at the top of the thoracic cavity. Anatomical structures that surround and protect the tracheobronchial tree include the lungs, the esophagus, large blood vessels, the rib cage, the thoracic spine, and the sternum. Children have softer tracheas and a more elastic tracheobronchial trees than adults; this elasticity, which helps protect the structures from injury when they are compressed, may contribute to the lower incidence of TBI in children.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} step {{in the development of}} open circuit scuba technology was the invention of the demand regulator in 1864 by the French engineers Auguste Denayrouze and Benoît Rouquayrol. Their suit was the first to <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> to the user by adjusting the flow according to the diver's requirements. The system still had to use surface supply, as the storage cylinders of the 1860s were not able to withstand the high pressures necessary for a practical self-contained unit.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{quantify}} the indoor air quality of multi-family houses and to obtain the basic data for the estimation of air quality by using the volatilizing rate of each part of the finishing material.

40|$|The {{impact of}} a {{filtering}} half-face respirator and a half-face <b>supplied</b> <b>air</b> respirator use on blood lactate production was assessed during maximal exertion to determine if anaerobic strain increased compared to no respirator use. Twenty-eight participants performed a 30 second cycling Wingate anaerobic test (WAnT) wearing a half-face respirator. Blood lactate production was measured to evaluate {{if there was an}} increase in anaerobic strain from wearing a tight fitting half-face respirator compared to wearing no respirator. A <b>supplied</b> <b>air</b> respirator WAnT was then performed using 18 participants from the first experiment to evaluate if <b>supplied</b> <b>air</b> decreased anaerobic strain. Data from both experiments were compared to evaluate differences in the physiological effects due to respirator use during maximal exertion.

25|$|A {{side effect}} of {{breaking}} the strong molecular bonds of dioxin {{is the potential for}} breaking the bonds of nitrogen gas (N2) and oxygen gas (O2) in the <b>supply</b> <b>air.</b> As the exhaust flow cools, these highly reactive detached atoms spontaneously reform bonds into reactive oxides such as NOx in the flue gas, which can result in smog formation and acid rain if they were released directly into the local environment.

40|$|NASA is {{developing}} two new pieces of emergency response equipment that recognize {{and address the}} constraints of a confined space environment. One piece of equipment is a respirator designed {{for use in a}} post fire environment. Traditional first responders generally use <b>supplied</b> <b>air</b> respirators - they provide cool, dry, safe breathing air to the first responder, and because they are supplied at above ambient pressure, the system is tolerant to a loose-fitting mask. <b>Supplied</b> <b>air</b> respirators have a limited <b>supply</b> of <b>air,</b> but because the traditional first responder intends to address the emergency from outside and then retreat, this limited <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> does not pose a serious problem. NASA uses a supplied oxygen respirator for first response to an emergency affecting air quality on the International Space Station. The <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> is rated for 15 minutes - ISS program managers sponsored a hardware development activity to provide the astronauts up to 8 hours of breathing protection after the <b>supplied</b> <b>air</b> system is exhausted. Size and weight limitations prevent the use of a <b>supplied</b> <b>air</b> system for 8 hours for six crew members. A trade study resulted in the selection of a filtering respirator system over a re-breather system; due to design simplicity, operational simplicity, and likely threats to air quality on ISS. The respirator cartridge that filters smoke particles, adsorbs organics and acid gases, and catalytically converts carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide has been qualified for use on ISS, and was delivered on STS- 135, the final mission of the Space Shuttle Program...|$|R
25|$|On 13 June, the RLAF flew 17 sorties against Pathet Lao {{artillery}} and antiaircraft guns on Phou Kout Mountain menacing Neutralist positions near Muang Soui.

Although this disclosed a dangerous shortcoming in the Lao military's air management, General Thao Ma, commander of the RLAF, refused to <b>supply</b> <b>Air</b> Liaison Officers to direct the RLAF T-28 Trojans for the planned Lao attack. In fact, Ma transferred nine of his 20 T-28s south to Savannakhet, moving them out of possible range of targets on the Plain of Jars.

Two American pilots from Project Waterpump in Udorn, Thailand were forwarded to the Neutralists to fly O-1 Bird Dogs in their support, but their efforts were foiled by restrictions imposed by American ambassador Leonard Unger.
