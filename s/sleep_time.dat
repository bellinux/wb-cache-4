5|$|Unlike humans, horses do {{not sleep}} in a solid, {{unbroken}} period of time, but take many short periods of rest. Horses spend four to fifteen {{hours a day in}} standing rest, and from a few minutes to several hours lying down. Total <b>sleep</b> <b>time</b> in a 24-hour period may range from several minutes to a couple of hours, mostly in short intervals of about 15minutes each.

5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the <b>sleep</b> <b>time,</b> and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, during wake periods {{differentiated}} effector cells, such as cytotoxic natural killer {{cells and}} CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens. As well during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and catecholamines, peak. There are two theories {{as to why the}} pro-inflammatory state is reserved for <b>sleep</b> <b>time.</b> First, inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times. Second, inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin. Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Human {{behavior}} shows large interindividual {{variation in}} temporal organization. Extreme “larks ” wake up when extreme “owls ” fall asleep. These chronotypes {{are attributed to}} differences in the circadian clock, and in animals, the genetic basis of similar phenotypic differences is well established. To better understand the genetic basis of temporal organization in humans, the authors developed a questionnaire to document individual <b>sleep</b> <b>times,</b> self-reported light exposure, and self-assessed chronotype, considering work and free days separately. This report summarizes the results of 500 questionnaires completed in a pilot study. Individual <b>sleep</b> <b>times</b> show large differences between work and free days, except for extreme early types. During the workweek, late chronotypes accumulate considerable sleep debt, for which they compensate on free days by lengthening their sleep by several hours. For all chronotypes, {{the amount of time}} spent outdoors in broad daylight significantly affects the timing of sleep: Increased self-reported light exposure advances sleep.

40|$|Study Objectives: To {{parameterize}} and validate a {{model to}} estimate average <b>sleep</b> <b>times</b> for long-haul aviation pilots during layovers following travel across multiple time zones. The model equations {{were based on a}} weighted distribution of domicile- and local-time sleepers, and included algorithms to account for sleep loss and circadian re-synchronization. Design: <b>Sleep</b> <b>times</b> were collected from participants under normal commercial operating conditions using diaries and wrist activity monitors. Participants: Participants included a total of 306 long-haul pilots (113 captains, 120 first officers, and 73 second officers). Measurement and Results: The model was parameterized based on the average sleep/wake times observed during international flight patterns from Australia to London and Los Angeles (global R 2 = 0. 72). The parameterized model was validated against the average sleep/wake times observed during flight patterns from Australia to London (r 2 = 0. 85), Los Angeles (r 2 = 0. 79), New York (r 2 = 0. 80), and Johannesburg (r 2 = 0. 73). Goodness-of-fit was poorer when the parameterized model equations were used to predict the variance across the sleep/wake cycles of individual pilots (R 2 = 0. 42, 0. 35, 0. 31, and 0. 28 for the validation flight patterns, respectively), in part because of substantial inter-individual variability in sleep timing and duration. Conclusions: It is possible to estimate average <b>sleep</b> <b>times</b> during layovers in international patterns with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Models of this type could form the basis of a stand-alone application to estimate the likelihood that a given duty schedule provides pilots, on average, with an adequate opportunity to sleep...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{onset of}} {{adolescence}} {{is a time}} of dramatic changes, including changes in <b>sleep,</b> and a <b>time</b> of new health concerns related to increases in risk-taking, sensation seeking, depression, substance use, and accidents. As part of a larger study examining puberty-specific changes in adolescents' reward-related brain function, the current article focuses on the relationship between functional neuroimaging measures of reward and measures of sleep. Methods A total of 58 healthy participants 11 – 13 years of age completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan using a guessing task with monetary rewards and 4 days of at-home actigraphy and self-reported sleep ratings. Sleep variables included actigraph measures of mean weekend minutes asleep, <b>sleep</b> onset <b>time,</b> and <b>sleep</b> offset <b>time,</b> as well as self-reported sleep quality. Results During reward anticipation, less activation in the caudate (part of the ventral striatum) was associated with fewer minutes asleep, later <b>sleep</b> onset <b>time,</b> and lower <b>sleep</b> quality. During reward outcome, less caudate activation was associated with later <b>sleep</b> onset <b>time,</b> earlier <b>sleep</b> offset <b>time,</b> and lower <b>sleep</b> quality. Conclusions It has been hypothesized that adolescents' low reactivity in reward-related brain areas could lead to compensatory increases in reward-driven behavior. This study's findings suggest that sleep could contribute to such behavior. Because decreased sleep has been associated with risky behavior and negative mood, these findings raise concerns about a negative spiral whereby the effects of puberty and sleep deprivation may have synergistic effects on reward processing, contributing to adolescent behavioral and emotional health problems...|$|R

25|$|One neurochemical {{indicator}} of sleep debt is adenosine, a neurotransmitter that inhibits {{many of the}} bodily processes associated with wakefulness. Adenosine levels increase in the cortex and basal forebrain during prolonged wakefulness and decrease during the sleep-recovery period, potentially acting as a homeostatic regulator of sleep. Coffee and caffeine temporarily block the effect of adenosine, prolong sleep latency, and reduce total <b>sleep</b> <b>time</b> and quality.|$|E
25|$|Like alcohol, benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam, clonazepam, {{lorazepam}} and diazepam, {{are commonly}} used to treat insomnia in the short-term (both prescribed and self-medicated), but worsen sleep in the long-term. While benzodiazepines can put people to sleep (i.e., inhibit NREM stage 1 and 2 sleep), while asleep, the drugs disrupt sleep architecture: decreasing <b>sleep</b> <b>time,</b> delaying time to REM sleep, and decreasing deep slow-wave sleep (the most restorative part of sleep for both energy and mood).|$|E

40|$|Administration of {{diphtheria}} and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine adsorbed (DTP vaccine) or endotoxin (LPS) {{resulted in}} marked alterations in hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes in endotoxin-responsive (R) and non-endotoxin-responsive (NR) mice. A single human dose (0. 5 ml) of DTP vaccine increased hexobarbital-induced <b>sleep</b> <b>times</b> to 1. 6 - to 1. 8 -fold above those of controls in both strains of mice. This effect persisted for 7 days. In contrast, Bordetella pertussis LPS-treated mice showed an increase at 1 day (3. 0 -fold for R mice and 1. 5 -fold for NR mice), which returned to control levels by day 7. Furthermore, cytochrome P- 450 levels were decreased 30 to 40 % 24 h after DTP vaccine administration in both R and NR mice, while after LPS administration they were decreased 30 % in R mice {{and less than}} 10 % in NR mice. Both spleen and liver weights of R and NR mice were increased 7 to 14 days following DTP vaccine administration. However, LPS treatment had no apparent effect on liver weights, and spleen weights of R mice were elevated from days 3 to 7. Histopathologic tissue examination showed random, multifocal inflammation with hepatocyte necrosis after DTP vaccine administration to both R and NR mice and an absence of lesions in LPS-treated mice. Premixing LPS with polymyxin eliminated the increased <b>sleep</b> <b>times,</b> but premixing DTP vaccine with polymyxin {{did not affect the}} increased <b>sleep</b> <b>times.</b> Levels of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin- 6 in plasma of R mice were markedly increased after DTP and LPS treatment, while NR mice had reduced increases.

40|$|Inter-individual {{differences}} in the phase of the endogenous circadian rhythms have been established. Individuals with early circadian phase are called morning types; those with late circadian phase are evening types. The Horne and &# 214;stberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) is {{the most frequently used}} to assess individual chronotype. The distribution of MEQ scores is likely to be biased by several fact, ors, such as gender, age, genetic background, latitude, and social habits. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine the effect of different social synchronizers on the sleep/wake cycle of persons with different chronotypes. Volunteers were selected from a total of 1232 UFPR undergraduate students who completed the MEQ. Thirty-two subjects completed the study, including 8 morning types, 8 evening types and 16 intermediate types. Sleep schedules were recorded by actigraphy for 1 week on two occasions: during the school term and during vacation. Sleep onset and offset <b>times,</b> <b>sleep</b> duration, and mid-sleep time for each chronotype group were compared by the Mann-Whitney U-test separately for school term and vacation.

During vacation, the subjects showed later <b>sleep</b> <b>times,</b> except for the morning types, who did not exhibit differences for <b>sleep</b> onset <b>times.</b> The results support the idea that social schedules have an impact on the expression of circadian rhythmicity but this impact depends on the individual chronotype...|$|R
25|$|People {{with normal}} {{circadian}} systems can generally fall asleep quickly at night if they slept too little the night before.

25|$|Reptiles have {{quiescent}} periods {{similar to}} mammalian sleep, and {{a decrease in}} electrical activity in the brain has been registered when the animals have been asleep. However, the EEG pattern in reptilian sleep differs from what is seen in mammals and other animals.

25|$|Since monotremes, {{egg-laying}} mammals, {{are considered}} to represent one of the evolutionarily oldest groups of mammals, they {{have been subject to}} special interest in the study of mammalian sleep.

However, EEG recordings of the brain stem in monotremes show a firing pattern that is quite similar to the patterns seen in REM sleep in higher mammals. In fact, the largest amount of REM sleep known in any animal is found in the platypus. REM electrical activation does not extend at all to the forebrain—suggesting that platypods do not dream.

500|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, most red foxes favour {{living in the}} open, in densely vegetated areas, though they may enter burrows to escape bad weather. Their burrows are often dug on hill or mountain slopes, ravines, bluffs, steep banks of water bodies, ditches, depressions, gutters, in rock clefts and neglected human environments. Red foxes prefer to dig their burrows on well drained soils. Dens built among tree roots can last for decades, while those dug on the steppes last only several years. They may permanently abandon their dens during mange outbreaks, possibly as a defence mechanism against the spread of disease. In the Eurasian desert regions, foxes may use the burrows of wolves, porcupines and other large mammals, {{as well as those}} dug by gerbil colonies. Compared to burrows constructed by Arctic foxes, badgers, marmots and corsac foxes, red fox dens are not overly complex. Red fox burrows are divided into a den and temporary burrows, which consist only of a small passage or cave for concealment. The main entrance of the burrow leads downwards (40–45°) and broadens into a den, from which numerous side tunnels branch. Burrow depth ranges from , rarely extending to ground water. The main passage can reach [...] in length, standing an average of [...] In spring, red foxes clear their dens of excess soil through rapid movements, first with the forepaws then with kicking motions with their hind legs, throwing the discarded soil over [...] from the burrow. When kits are born, the discarded debris is trampled, thus forming a spot where the kits can play and receive food. They may share their dens with woodchucks or badgers. Unlike badgers, which fastidiously clean their earths and defecate in latrines, red foxes habitually leave pieces of prey around their dens.> The average <b>sleep</b> <b>time</b> of a captive red fox is 9.8 hours per day.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Sleep {{variability}} (intra-individual {{variability in}} bedtime and sleep duration) is prevalent among college students. The current study aims {{to investigate the}} associations between sleep variability and decision making behaviors. Methods: Sixty-six college students (16 males, age = 17 – 23 y) participated in the present study, which included the actigraphic sleep assessment (Actiwatch Pro, Philips Respironics, Inc.) for eight consecutive days, followed by the completion of computerized tasks in the laboratory. Sleep parameters derived from the actigraphy included {{the means and standard}} deviations (SD) of <b>sleep</b> onset <b>time,</b> <b>sleep</b> offset <b>time,</b> nocturnal <b>sleep</b> duration and wake-after sleep-onset. Sleep variability was represented by SD. Impulsive decision-making behaviors were measured by the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) and the reward discounting task. Temporal discount (i. e., preference to smaller immediate rewards over larger delayed rewards) and effort discount (i. e., preference to typing less letters for smaller rewards over typing more letters for larger rewards) were reflected by the area under the curve (AUC), in which smaller AUCs suggesting more impatient choice pattern. Linear regression analyses were applied to examine the relationships between decision-making (dependent variables) and sleep variability (independent variables), in which gender, mental health, average <b>sleep</b> onset <b>time</b> and nocturnal <b>sleep</b> duration were included as covariates. Results: The average <b>sleep</b> onset <b>time</b> was 01 : 13 [*]±[*] 1 : 17 am, and the SD of <b>sleep</b> onset <b>time</b> was 1. 17 [*]±[*] 0. 65 [*]h. The average night sleep duration was 6. 87 [*]±[*] 0. 95 [*]h, and the SD of night sleep duration was 1. 56 [*]±[*] 0. 66 [*]h. Higher degree of variability in <b>sleep</b> onset <b>time</b> (as reflected by larger SD) was related with lower AUC in the effort discounting task, indicating a higher discount rate (ß = - 0. 52, p < 0. 001). However, no significant association was found between the performance in BART or temporal discounting of monetary rewards, and the variability in sleep parameters. Conclusion: Bedtime variability showed differential associations with discounting behaviors, which were similarly observed in individuals with sleep deprivation. In addition to sleep duration, the regularity of sleep-wake schedule may interfere with individual’s decision making especially when efforts are required...|$|R
