6000|$|III. After our {{previous}} experience, {{the impossibility of}} retaining [...] both metals in the coinage together, on equal terms, now came to [...] be generally recognized, and was accepted by Congress in the [...] legislation of 1853. This act made no further changes intended to [...] adapt the mint to the market ratios, but remained satisfied with [...] the gold circulation. But hitherto no regard had {{been paid to the}} [...] principles on which a subsidiary coinage is based, as explained by [...] Mr. Mill in the last section (§ 2). The act of 1853, while [...] acquiescing in the single gold standard, had for its purpose the [...] readjustment of the subsidiary coins, which, together with silver [...] dollar-pieces, had all gone out of circulation. Before this, two [...] halves, four quarters, or ten dimes contained the same quantity of [...] pure silver as the dollar-piece (371-¼ grains); therefore, when it [...] became profitable to withdraw the dollar-pieces and substitute [...] gold, it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or [...] four quarters in silver. For this reason all the subsidiary silver [...] had gone out of circulation, and there was no “small change” in [...] the country. The legislation of 1853 rectified this error: (1) by [...] reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollar’s worth of [...] <b>subsidiary</b> <b>coin</b> to 345.6 grains. By making so much less an amount [...] of silver equal to a dollar of small coins, it was more valuable [...] in that shape than as bullion, and {{there was no reason for}} melting [...] it, or withdrawing it (since even if gold and silver changed [...] considerably in their relative values, 345.6 grains of silver [...] could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a [...] gold dollar, when 371-¼ grains were worth only 104 cents of the [...] gold dollar); (2) this over-valuation of silver in <b>subsidiary</b> <b>coin</b> [...] would cause a great flow of silver to the mint, since silver would [...] be more valuable in <b>subsidiary</b> <b>coin</b> than as bullion; but this was [...] prevented by the provision (section 4 of the act of 1853) that the [...] amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the [...] discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury; and, (3) in order [...] that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes [...] other than for effecting change, its legal-tender power was [...] restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars. This system, a [...] single gold standard for large, and silver for small, payments, [...] continued without question, and with great convenience, until the [...] days of the war, when paper money (1862-1879) drove out (by its [...] cheapness, again) both gold and silver. Paper was far cheaper than [...] the cheapest of the two metals.|$|E

The article is devoted to the 100 th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire in 1915. The article highlights the essence of the Ottomanism, panTurkism and pan-Islamism doctrines and analyzes the policies of the Ottoman government aimed at merging all people of the empire into one “new nation” consisting of “homogeneous elements” loyal to Ottoman Empire regardless of the ethnicity and religious beliefs ("Ottomanism"). The concept of Ottomanism was oriented against the Christian peoples’ national liberation movement and it was intensively inculcated during the tyranny rule by sultan Abdul Hamid II. The Sultan government has also adopted an Islamic reactionary ideological and political doctrine, strongly promoting and encouraging pan-Islamists activity. It is emphasized that the empire continued to be a cockpit of non-Turkish peoples for their liberation and Abdul Hamid II with his inner circle are responsible for the organization in 1894 – 1896 of terrible massacres of Armenians that astounded the world. The victorious Russian-Turkish war (1877 – 1878) was an indirect cause of those dramatic events. Armenian issue {{as a part of the}} Eastern Question was a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>coin</b> in the geopolitics of Great Powers. The break-up of Ottomanism and pan-Islamism ideas in the early XX century inaugurated the epoch of a new doctrine – panTurkism (the union of all Turkic peoples under the aegis of Turkey), which was put in the forefront as the Turkish national ideology by the government of the Young Turks...|$|E

2500|$|In 1863, {{the first}} issue was made of coins {{denominated}} in centavos, worth one hundredth of the peso. This was followed in 1866 by coins denominated [...] "one peso". Coins denominated in reales continued to be issued until 1897. In 1905, the gold content of the peso was reduced by 49.3% but the silver content of the peso remained initially unchanged (<b>subsidiary</b> <b>coins</b> were debased). However, from 1918 onward, the weight and fineness of all the silver coins declined, until 1977, when the last silver 100-peso coins were minted.|$|R
50|$|The 1853 acts had {{prohibited}} the mint from buying silver from the public. Since the silver dollar was heavy relative to its value, little silver was presented for striking into that piece. As the statutes {{did not permit}} the public to deposit silver and receive {{it back in the}} form of <b>subsidiary</b> silver <b>coins</b> (the three-cent piece through half dollar), this effectively placed the U.S. on the gold standard. Despite the statutes, in 1853 and 1854, Snowden had the mint purchase large quantities of silver bullion at a fixed price, generally above the market rate, and struck it into <b>coin.</b> Since the <b>subsidiary</b> <b>coins</b> were only legal tender to five dollars, and could not be redeemed for gold, this led to a glut of silver coins in commerce. This oversupply, which persisted through 1862, led to lower mintages of silver coins in the mid-1850s, including the three-cent piece. The largest mintage for the type 2 three-cent silver was in 1858, when 1,603,700 were struck for circulation.|$|R

For the colonial period (until 1810) the main pieces of evidence are: (i) the widespread use of informal means of payment, (ii) the difficulties faced in retiring from circulation low quality <b>subsidiary</b> <b>coins,</b> and (iii) the numerous official resolutions banning the exporting of fractional money from the colonies. For the period from 1810 to 1825, the episodes surrounding the introduction of copper coins in 1821 and the issuing of low denomination circulating bank notes in 1823 appear as the main supporting evidence.

As most of the archives concerning the Mint of Strasbourg have been lost, numerous problems could be solved and inaccuracies could be rectified due to the other stocks throughout the town.

After resisting for sixty years every attempt to introduce any form of fiduciary silver coinage, Congress adopted a <b>subsidiary</b> silver <b>coin</b> as an adjunct to the postal service, without realizing that the first step had been taken in the relegation of silver to the status of a subordinate monetary material. The new piece was the first silver coin in the history of the United States that was not legal tender for an unlimited amount.

There would be a copper centavo of 8·00 g. The need for a uniform national coinage was great, but the economic situation was unfavorable and it proved impossible to erect a mint at this time.

500|$|Worldwide {{consumption}} of silver {{more than doubled}} between 1958 and 1965, but production increased by only about 15 percent. Industrial uses for silver included photographic film, batteries, and electronic components. At the same time, the Mint's production of silver coin increased as it attempted to meet demand; it used 111.5 million troy ounces of silver in coinage in 1963, up from just over 38 million in 1958. In spite of the increased demand, silver prices were checked {{by the fact that}} the Treasury would redeem silver certificates: paper money exchangeable for silver dollars (or the bullion equivalent, [...]7734 troy ounces), thus placing a ceiling of $1.29 per ounce on the market. Without government as the supplier of last resort, silver would rise in price, likely making it profitable to melt not only silver dollars, but the <b>subsidiary</b> silver <b>coins</b> as well. In 1963, the gap between production and consumption by the non-communist world amounted to 209 million ounces. [...] Just lower than world production (210 million ounces), this gap was filled by the sale of Treasury silver at $1.29 per ounce. Even a rise in the price of silver likely would not have led to a major jump in production, as silver was for the most part obtained as a by-product in the mining of other metals, such as copper and lead.|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Mill’s statement, that, if paper be not issued of as low a [...] {{denomination}} as {{the lowest}} coin, “as much will remain as [...] convenience requires {{for the smaller}} payments,” will not hold [...] true.
