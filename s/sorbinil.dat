50|$|<b>Sorbinil</b> (INN) is an aldose reductase {{inhibitor}} {{being investigated}} {{for treatment of}} diabetic complications including neuropathy and retinopathy. Aldose reductase is an enzyme present in lens and brain that gets rid of excess glucose by converting it to sorbitol.

50|$|The {{treatment}} for galactosemic cataract {{is no different}} from general galactosemia treatment. In fact, galactosemic cataract {{is one of the few}} symptoms that is actually reversible. Infants should be immediately removed from a galactose diet when symptoms present, and the cataract should disappear and visibility should return to normal. Aldose reductase inhibitors, such as <b>sorbinil,</b> have also proven promising in preventing and reversing galactosemic cataracts. AR inhibitors hinder aldose reductase from synthesizing galactitol in the lens, and thus restricts the osmotic swelling of the lens fibers. Other AR inhibitors include the acetic acid compounds zopolrestat, tolrestat, alrestatin, and epalrestat. Many of these compounds have not been successful in clinical trials due to adverse pharmokinetic properties, inadequate efficacy and efficiency, and toxic side effects. Testing on such drug-treatments continues in order to determine potential long-term complications, and for a more detailed mechanism of how AR inhibitors prevent and reverse the galactosemic cataract.|$|E
5000|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{is recognized}} as {{a leading cause of}} new cases of blindness, and is associated with increased risk for painful neuropathy, heart disease and kidney failure. Many theories have been advanced to explain mechanisms leading to diabetic complications, including stimulation of glucose metabolism by the polyol pathway. Additionally, the enzyme is located in the eye (cornea, retina, lens), kidney, and the myelin sheath-tissues that are often involved in diabetic complications. [...] Under normal glycemic conditions, {{only a small fraction of}} glucose is metabolized through the polyol pathway, as the majority is phosphorylated by hexokinase, and the resulting product, glucose-6-phosphate, is utilized as a substrate for glycolysis or pentose phosphate metabolism. However, in response to the chronic hyperglycemia found in diabetics, glucose flux through the polyol pathway is significantly increased. Up to 33% of total glucose utilization in some tissues can be through the polyol pathway.Glucose concentrations are often elevated in diabetics and aldose reductase has long been believed to be responsible for diabetic complications involving a number of organs. Many aldose reductase inhibitors have been developed as drug candidates but virtually all have failed although some such as epalrestat are commercially available in several countries. Additional reductase inhibitors such as ranirestat, ponalrestat, rinalrestat, risarestat, <b>sorbinil,</b> and berberine are currently in clinical trials.|$|E

However, the effect these treatments have on vascular reactivity of epineurial vessels of the sciatic nerve is unknown. In these studies we examined the effect of treating streptozotocininduced rats with <b>sorbinil,</b> aminoguanidine or myo-inositol on motor nerve conduction velocity, endoneurial blood flow and endothelium dependent vascular relaxation of arterioles that provide circulation to the region of the sciatic nerve.

Streptozocin-diabetic rats were divided into the following five groups: (1) untreated (D); (2) treated with approximately 1 U NPH insulin/ 100 g body weight/d administered in one subcutaneous (SC) injection (DI- 1); (3) treated with the same total daily dose of insulin administered in two SC injections (DI- 2); (4) treated with approximately 0. 2 mmol <b>sorbinil</b> in the diet/kg body weight/ d (DS); and (5) treated with once-daily insulin plus <b>sorbinil</b> (DSI- 1). Two groups of nondiabetic rats, untreated (C) and sorbinil-treated (CS), served as controls. Metabolic parameters were unaffected by <b>sorbinil</b> treatment in controls and diabetics, whereas insulin administration in the diabetics virtually normalized body growth, food consumption, urine volume, and plasma glucose levels, and markedly decreased hemoglobin A 1 (HbA 1) levels. Two daily injections were more effective than one in improving metabolic control as measured by HbA 1 levels. Regional vascular 131 I- albumin permeation was increased about twofold to threefold by diabetes in ocular tissues, sciatic nerve, aorta, diaphragm, and new granulation tissue; it was decreased (but not normalized) by insulin treatment in accordance with improved metabolic control, and was completely normalized by <b>sorbinil.</b> 131 I-albumin kidney clearance, as well as urinary albumin and IgG excretion, were markedly increased in diabetic rats and were significantly decreased but not completely normalized by <b>sorbinil</b> and by twice-daily insulin treatment. The combined therapy significantly ameliorated the effect of insulin alone (which still did not completely normalize glucose and HbA 1 levels despite prevention of diabetes-induced weight loss and polyuria), although it did not produce an effect on vascular function beyond that of <b>sorbinil</b> alone (which had no impact on glycemia, HbA 1 level, urine volume, or weight gain). These findings suggest that a dual pharmacologic approach, ie, treatment {{with a combination of}} insulin, designed to decrease glucose levels (without risking hypoglycemia), and ARIs, to block excess flux of glucose via the sorbitol pathway due to the residual hyperglycemia, may be advantageous for promoting normal growth and metabolism and for preventing vascular complications while minimizing the risk of increased incidence of hypoglycemia...|$|E

40|$|Chronic low-grade {{inflammation}} {{has emerged}} as a key contributor to the cardiovascular complications of diabetes, however, the mechanisms by which diabetes increases inflammation remain poorly understood. Here, we report that exposure to high glucose (HG) stimulates ectodomain shedding of TNF-Î± from rat aortic smooth muscle cells in culture. Our results show that exposure to HG decreases membrane-associated TNF-Î±. This decrease in unprocessed TNF-Î± was prevented by the aldose reductase (AR) inhibitor <b>sorbinil</b> and AR small interference RNA. Treatment with HG, but not equimolar mannitol or 3 -O-methyl glucose, resulted in phosphorylation and activation of TNF-Î± converting enzyme (TACE) (ADAM 17), which were attenuated by <b>sorbinil</b> or AR-specific small interference RNA. HG-induced TACE phosphorylation and TNF-Î± processing were also prevented by TNF-Î± protease inhibitor- 1, an inhibitor of TACE. Inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) -Î´ by rottlerin prevented HG-induced TACE activation and the accumulation of unprocessed TNF-Î±. Treatment with <b>sorbinil</b> decreased elevated levels of circulating TNF-Î± in streptozotocin-treated diabetic rats. <b>Sorbinil</b> treatment also decreased the expression of TNF-Î±, matrix metalloproteinase- 2, matrix metalloproteinase- 9, and increased tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 3 in vascular smooth muscle cells treated with HG and in balloon-injured carotid arteries of diabetic rats. These results indicate that HG-induced TNF-Î± shedding could be attributed to TACE activation, which is regulated, in part, by PKC-Î´ and AR. Therefore, inhibition of TACE by TNF-Î± protease inhibitor- 1, or pharmacological inhibition of PKC-Î´ or AR may represent useful strategies for treating vascular inflammation associated with diabetes...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Glucose is {{converted}} to sorbitol and then to fructose via the polyol pathway that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of organ damage. The contribution of the polyol pathway to mesothelial cell activation has, however, not been fully determined. METHODS: The effect of increasing glucose concentrations on transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) secretion by human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMC) was examined. The importance of the polyol pathway was identified by its specific inhibition with an aldose reductase inhibitor. RESULTS: Incubation of HPMC with 5 to 100 mmol/L glucose resulted in an induction of aldose reductase mRNA and intracellular sorbitol accumulation accompanied by the induction of TGF-beta 1 and MCP- 1 mRNA expression and protein secretion.

The present study examined the effects of the accumulation of the AR end product, galactitol, induced by galactose feeding, on AR gene expression and on the balance of other cellular osmolytes, including inositol, in the renal medulla. To differentiate between the effects of excess substrate, product, and intervening osmotic factors, rats were fed either control, galactose, galactose and <b>sorbinil</b> (an AR inhibitor), or control plus <b>sorbinil</b> diets.

To test this hypothesis {{we examined the}} association between PKC activity, (Na,K) -ATPase activity, and sorbitol, myoinositol, and InsP levels in cultured bovine retinal capillary endothelial cells, a cell type prominently involved in diabetic retinopathy.

40|$|Time-dependent {{aspects of}} osmolyte changes in rat kidney, urine, blood and lens with <b>sorbinil</b> and {{galactose}} feeding. Sorbitol plus myo-inositol, betaine and glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC) are cellular osmolytes in the mammalian renal medulla. Galactosemia and hyperglycemia can cause excessive levels of galactitol or sorbitol in several organs via aldose reductase (AR) catalysis. AR inhibitors can reduce these polyols. To examine osmolyte responses to polyol perturbations, male Wistar rats were fed normal diet, the AR inhibitor <b>sorbinil</b> (at 40 mg/kg/d), 25 % galactose, or a combination, for 10, 21 and 42 days. All animals at 21 days had higher apparent renal AR activity than at 10 or 42 days, possibly providing resistance to <b>sorbinil.</b> <b>Sorbinil</b> feeding alone tended to increase urinary, plasma and renal urea levels. It reduced AR activity and sorbitol contents in renal inner medulla, though less so at 21 days; other renal osmolytes, especially betaine, were elevated. Galactose feeding caused {{little change in}} renal AR activity, and resulted in high galactose and galactitol contents in renal medulla, urine, blood and lens (and higher renal Na+ contents at 10 days). Renal sorbitol, inositol and GPC decreased, while betaine contents trended higher at all times. Sorbinil-galactose feeding reduced renal AR activities and galactitol contents (again less so at 21 days), urine, blood and lens galactitol, and further reduced renal sorbitol contents. At 10 and 21 days it tended to raise renal betaine more, and restore inositol (but not GPC) contents to control levels. At 42 days it reduced renal and urinary Na+ and galactose, and decreased renal betaine to control levels. Under most conditions, total renal (non-urea) organic osmolyte contents (presumed to be mostly intracellular) and Na+ plus galactose contents (presumed mostly extracellular) changed together such that cell volumes may have been maintained. The exception was 10 days on galactose, where total osmolytes appeared too low. In galactose-fed animals, urine/plasma ratios suggest some renal galactitol efflux, and cellular galactitol probably helps maintain osmotic balance rather than cause swelling...|$|E

The enzyme assay was used to determine the response of erythrocyte sorbitol content in a clinical trial of diabetics treated with oral <b>Sorbinil</b> a novel aldose reductase inhibitor.

The capillary GLC method was used to determine the daily effect of oral <b>Sorbinil</b> upon erythrocyte sorbitol and myo-inositol concentrations in a clinical trial with diabetic subjects. It was found that <b>Sorbinil</b> therapy reduced the raised erythrocyte sorbitol by 60 % within the first 24 hours of treatment at a lower dose than used in previous studies. The erythrocyte myo-inositol content of diabetic subjects was not altered by <b>Sorbinil</b> therapy. However, it was found, for the first time, that the myo-inositol level in diabetics was found to be significantly different to healthy, normal non-diabetic subjects. The daily variation in erythrocyte sorbitol and myo-inositol in normal non-diabetic subjects was investigated. The levels were found to be very consistent both for individuals and as a group and were significantly different to the levels found in diabetic subjects. The activity of erythrocyte aldose reductase was found to be greater in diabetics compared to normals. Capillary GLC was used to confirm the erythrocyte accumulation of sorbitol upon incubation with glucose. The concentration of other components in the erythrocyte were seen to change upon glucose incubation. The increase of one component was initially identified by its retention as glucosamine. An attempt to correlate the erythrocyte aldose reductase activity with the degree of severity of subjects with diabetic neuropathy was unsuccessful. Further work is required to optimise the assay conditions. It is concluded that the erythrocyte sorbitol levels can be used in conjunction with other tests and clinical observations to manage the long term complications associated with diabetes.

40|$|Abstractâ€”Abnormal {{proliferation}} of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) {{is an important}} feature of atherosclerosis, restenosis, and hypertension. Although multiple mediators of VSMC growth have been identified, few effective pharmacological tools {{have been developed to}} limit such growth. Recent evidence indicating an important role for oxidative stress in cell growth led us to investigate the potential role of aldose reductase (AR) in the {{proliferation of}} VSMCs. Because AR catalyzes the reduction of mitogenic aldehydes derived from lipid peroxidation, we hypothesized that it might be a potential regulator of redox changes that accompany VSMC growth. Herein we report several lines of evidence suggesting that AR facilitates/mediates VSMC growth. Stimulation of human aortic SMCs in culture with mitogenic concentrations of serum, thrombin, basic fibroblast growth factor, and the lipid peroxidation product 4 -hydroxy-trans- 2 -nonenal (HNE) led to a 2 - to 4 -fold increase in the steady-state levels of AR mRNA, a 4 - to 7 -fold increase in AR protein, and a 2 - to 3 -fold increase in its catalytic activity.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Prevention of {{diabetic}} retinopathy {{would benefit from}} availability of drugs that preempt the effects of hyperglycemia on retinal vessels. We aimed to identify candidate drug targets by investigating the molecular effects of drugs that prevent retinal capillary demise in the diabetic rat. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the gene expression profile of retinal vessels isolated from rats with 6 months of streptozotocin-induced diabetes and compared it with that of control rats. We then tested whether the aldose reductase inhibitor <b>sorbinil</b> and aspirin, which have different mechanisms of action, prevented common molecular abnormalities induced by diabetes. The Affymetrix GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2. 0 array was complemented by real-time RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The retinal vessels of diabetic rats showed differential expression of 20 genes of the transforming growth factor (TGF) -Î² pathway, in addition to genes involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, vascular remodeling, and apoptosis. The complete loop of TGF-Î² signaling, including Smad 2 phosphorylation, was enhanced in the retinal vessels, {{but not in the}} neural retina. <b>Sorbinil</b> normalized the expression of 71 % of the genes related to oxidative stress and 62 % of those related to inflammation.

We evaluated whether a short-term intervention with an adequate dose of ARI, introduced {{at the very}} early, precataractous stage, reversed diabetes-induced metabolic imbalances, down-regulation of ATPases and oxidative stress in the lens. Methods. The groups included mature control and streptozotocin-diabetic rats treated with or without ARI <b>sorbinil</b> (65 mg Â· kg â€“ 1 Â· day â€“ 1, in the diet, for 2 weeks after 4 weeks of untreated diabetes).

Concentrations of metabolites and adenine nucleotides, Na + /K + -ATPase, H + -ATPase and Ca ++ -independent Mg ++ -ATPase activities and variables of oxidative stress were measured in individual lenses. Results. <b>Sorbinil</b> treatment essentially corrected diabetes-induced sorbitol and fructose accumulation, myo -inositol depletion, decrease in free cytosolic NAD + :NADH ratio and energy deficiency.

40|$|Increased iris vessel {{permeability}} {{observed in}} diabetics {{has also been}} reported to occur in diabetic animals and galactose-fed rats. The potential role of aldose reductase in the induction of iris vessel-changes has been investigated in rats fed a 50 % galactose diet with/without the aldose reductase inhibitors AL 1576, <b>sorbinil</b> or ponalrestat for 7 to 18 months. Compared to normal control rats, long-term galactose-fed rats display {{a breakdown of the}} blood-aqueous barrier due to iris vessel changes that include focal straightening, dilation, constriction, increased permeability, ischemia and new vessel proliferation. The onset and progression of these iridal vessel changes were prevented by the aldose reductase inhibitors AL 1576 and <b>sorbinil,</b> and reduced by Ponalrestat. Computerized analyses of lumen areas of iris vessels indicated an 18 -fold decrease in the vascular area near the pupillary boarder in untreated galactose-fed rats compared with age- matched controls and galactose-fed rats treated with aldose reductase inhibitors. These observations linking iris vessel changes with galactose- feeding, coupled with the fact that aldose reductase inhibitors also prevent these changes, strongly suggest a link between the sorbitol pathway and the appearance and progression of iris vessel changes.

40|$|Young beagle {{dogs were}} fed a 30 % {{galactose}} diet, {{with or without}} the aldose reductase inhibitors <b>sorbinil</b> or M 79175. Cataract formation was monitored by indirect ophthalmoscope and hand-held slit-lamp microscopy and documented by retroillumination photography. In these dogs, the first sign of cataract development was an accentuation of the anterior and posterior lens sutures (1 month after feeding), then the appearance of cortical vacuoles (3 months after feeding), and finally, the formation of predominantly equatorial cortical opacities toward the posterior cortices (4 - 6 months after feeding). After long-term galactose feeding, a progressive, irregular, clear zone formed at the cortical equatorial regions. Light microscopic examination of these lenses shows that the cataracts are osmotic, many of the lens fibers appear to be swollen or ruptured, and vacuoles are seen near the bow region. Moreover, these histologic changes were reduced in a dose-dependent manner in galactose-fed dogs concomitantly treated with the aldose reductase inhibitors <b>sorbinil</b> or M 79175. The osmotic nature of these cataracts and the observation that their formation can be reduced in a dose-dependent manner by aldose reductase inhibitors are consistent with the concept that the aldose-reductase catalyzed formation of polar sugar alcohols (polyols) initiates sugar cataract formation in the dog.

40|$|Renal {{proximal}} tubular cell fibronectin accumulation {{in response}} to glucose is polyol pathway dependent. BackgroundThickening and reduplication of the tubular basement membrane have been reported as early events in diabetic nephropathy. In this study, we have examined the polar requirements of proximal tubular cells for the D-glucoseâ€“stimulated accumulation of fibronectin and the mechanism by which this occurred, with particular emphasis on the polyol pathway. MethodsTo determine the polarity of fibronectin generation {{in response to}} glucose, LLC-PK 1 cells were grown on porous tissue culture inserts. Monolayer confluence was determined by serial measurement of transepithelial resistance. Confluent cells were growth arrested by serum deprivation, and all experiments were performed under serum-free conditions. ResultsApplication of 25 mm d-glucose to either the apical or basolateral aspect of LLC-PK 1 cells led to fibronectin accumulation in the basolateral compartment. This reached statistical significance 24 hours following apical addition of glucose (2. 6 -fold increase compared with 5 mm d-glucose, P = 0. 0025, N = 6 vs. N = 4 controls) and 12 hours after the basolateral addition of glucose (2. 5 -fold increase compared with 5 mm d-glucose, P = 0. 03, N = 6 vs. N = 4 controls). Exposure of cells to glucose at either their apical or basolateral aspect leads to accumulation of intracellular glucose and polyol pathway activation, as assessed by sorbitol accumulation. The increase in fibronectin concentration in response to glucose was inhibited by the aldose reductase inhibitor <b>sorbinil.</b> At a dose of 100 Î¼m <b>sorbinil,</b> there was a 59 % inhibition of fibronectin accumulation in response to apical glucose (P = 0. 004, N = 3 <b>sorbinil</b> vs. N = 4 controls) and a 66 % inhibition in response to basolateral glucose (P = 0. 008, N = 3 <b>sorbinil</b> vs. N = 4 controls) 48 hours after {{the addition of the}} inhibitor. Furthermore, fibronectin accumulation was also demonstrated following both the apical and basolateral addition of 1 mm sorbitol, but not following the addition of 25 mm galactose to either aspect of the cells. Following the addition of sorbitol, there was a 2. 8 -fold increase in fibronectin 48 hours after apical stimulation (P = 0. 01, N = 3 treated vs. N = 4 control) and a 2. 27 -fold increase following basolateral stimulation (P = 0. 04, N = 3 treated vs. N = 4 control) at 24 hours. ConclusionsIn summary, these data demonstrate that fibronectin generation in response to glucose was nonpolar in terms of application of glucose but was polar in terms of fibronectin accumulation. The mechanisms of glucose-induced modulation of fibronectin were mediated by polyol pathway activation and were more specifically related to the metabolism of sorbitol to fructose...|$|E
40|$|The kinetic {{mechanism}} of the major sheep liver aldehyde reductase (ALR 1) was studied with three aldehyde substrates: p-nitrobenzaldehyde, pyridine- 3 -aldehyde and D-glucuronate. In each case the enzyme mechanism was sequential and product-inhibition studies were consistent with an ordered Bi Bi mechanism, with the coenzymes binding to the free enzyme. Binding studies were used to investigate the interactions of substrates, products and inhibitors with the free enzyme. These provided evidence for the binding of D-glucuronate, L-gulonate and valproate, as well as NADP+ and NADPH. The enzyme was inhibited by high concentrations of D-glucuronate in a non-competitive manner, indicating that this substrate was able to bind to the free enzyme and to the E X NADP+ complex at elevated concentrations. Although the enzyme was inhibited by high pyridine- 3 -aldehyde concentrations, {{there was no evidence}} for the binding of this substrate to the free enzyme. Sheep liver ALR 1 was inhibited by the ionized forms of alrestatin, <b>sorbinil,</b> valproate, 2 -ethylhexanoate and phenobarbitone, indicating the presence of an anion-binding site similar to that described for the pig liver enzyme, which interacts with inhibitors and substrates containing a carboxy group. <b>Sorbinil,</b> valproate and 2 -ethylhexanoate inhibited the enzyme uncompetitively at low concentrations and non-competitively at high concentrations, whereas phenobarbitone and alrestatin were non-competitive and uncompetitive inhibitors respectively.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, we {{examined}} the role of aldose reductase (AR) in regulating the cytotoxic effects of TNF-Î± on human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Inhibition of AR by <b>sorbinil</b> or tolrestat prevented TNF-Î±-induced increase in Bax and Bak and the downregulation of Bcl- 2. Inhibition of AR abrogated AP- 1 DNA binding activity and prevented the activation of caspase- 3, JNK, and p 38 MAPK in cells stimulated by TNF-Î±. Exposure to TNF-Î± also induced apoptotic cell death, which was attenuated by AR inhibition or antisense ablation. These observations suggest that AR is a critical regulator of TNF-Î±-induced apoptotic signaling in endothelial cells...|$|E

40|$|Aldose reductase (AR; EC 1. 1. 1. 21), an {{nicotinamide}} adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent aldoâ€“keto reductase, {{has been}} shown to be involved in oxidative stress signaling initiated by inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Recently, we have shown that inhibition of this enzyme prevents the growth of colon cancer cells in vitro as well as in nude mice xenografts. Herein, we investigated the mediation of AR in the formation of colonic preneoplastic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) using azoxymethane (AOM) -induced colon cancer mice model. Male BALB/c mice were administrated with AOM without or with AR inhibitor, <b>sorbinil</b> and at the end of the protocol, all the mice were euthanized and colons were evaluated for ACF formation. Administration of <b>sorbinil</b> significantly lowered the number of AOM-induced ACF. Similarly, AR-null mice administered with AOM demonstrated significant resistance to ACF formation. Furthermore, inhibition of AR or knockout of AR gene in the mice significantly prevented AOM-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase- 2 proteins as well as their messenger RNA. AR inhibition or knockdown also significantly decreased the phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC) Î² 2 and nuclear factor kappa binding protein as well as expression of preneoplastic marker proteins such as cyclin D 1 and Î²-catenin in mice colons. Our results suggest that AR mediates the formation of ACF in AOM-treated mice and thereby inhibition of AR could provide an effective chemopreventive approach for the treatment of colon cancer...|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”Aldose reductase (AR), {{a member}} of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily, has been shown to metabolize toxic {{aldehydes}} generated by lipid peroxidation, suggesting that it may serve as an antioxidant defense. To investigate its role in the late phase of ischemic preconditioning (PC), conscious rabbits underwent 6 cycles of 4 -minute coronary occlusion/ 4 -minute reperfusion. Twenty-four hours later, there was a marked increase in AR protein and activity and in the myocardial content of sorbitol, a unique product of AR catalysis. Pretreatment with Nï¿½-nitro-L-arginine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, or chelerythrine, a protein kinase C inhibitor (both given at doses that block late PC in this model), prevented the increase in AR protein 24 hours later, demonstrating that ischemic PC upregulates AR via nitric oxide â€“ and protein kinase Câ€“dependent signaling pathways. The AR-selective inhibitors tolrestat and <b>sorbinil</b> prevented AR-mediated accumulation of sorbitol and abrogated the infarct-sparing effect of late PC, demonstrating that enhanced AR activity is necessary for this cardioprotective phenomenon to occur. Inhibition of AR did not affect infarct size or the myocardial accumulation of the lipid peroxidation product 4 -hydroxy trans- 2 -nonenal (HNE) in nonpreconditioned rabbits. The accumulation of HNE was inhibited by late PC, and this effect was abrogated by <b>sorbinil.</b> Taken together, these results establish AR as an essential mediator of late PC. Furthermore, the data suggest that myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury {{is due in part to}} the generation of lipid peroxidation products and that late PC diminishes this source of injury by upregulating AR.
