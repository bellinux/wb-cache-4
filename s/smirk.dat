Jerry Levin wrote in his 2005book West Bank Diary: Middle East Violence as Reported by a Former American Hostage about {{a woman in a}} coffee shop telling him to [...] "have a nice day" [...] after he purchased a sweet roll and coffee. Levin stated that there is also a [...] "grimmer version of the pervasive pleasantry".

500|$|Ward's images offer a {{diversity}} of textures, moods, detail, and composition, and mix in influence from movements such as American Regionalism and Futurism. [...] The seeming homoeroticism in the artwork drew attention, such as the prominent rear shots of the protagonist, the sort of imagery that prompted Susan Sontag to note Ward's work in her 1964 essay [...] "Notes on 'Camp'. [...] Writer Sarah Boxer found the prominence of such imagery distracting. [...] Spiegelman defends the book against critics who <b>smirk</b> at the Ward's artwork's affinity with the [...] "fetishistic figures and landscape" [...] of Thomas Hart Benton and the homoerotic art of Tom of Finland, saying the book's [...] "passion and even its off sexual subcurrents are among its strengths", and calls it [...] "in some ways the most accessible and satisfying" [...] of Ward's books.|$|E
500|$|Futterman {{praised the}} return of Chenoweth's {{character}} April Rhodes, and The Wall Street Journal Raymund Flandez said that she [...] "brings such lightness, humor and zaniness that's endearingly button-nose cute".

[...] Reiter was unenthusiastic: she acknowledged [...] "Chenoweth's amazing pipes", but added [...] "her character, which was thin to start with, has kind of worn out its welcome". The subplot of Will thinking about going to Broadway with April was roundly criticized: both Meghan Brown of The Atlantic and Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle {{said there was no}} tension at all because the viewer knows that he will stay. The A.V. Club Zack Handlen called the entire scenario [...] "ludicrous", made even more so by the highly compressed time frame, and their dress rehearsal [...] "bizarre", criticisms echoed by Brown.|$|E

500|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{describes}} [...] "His Name Is Legs" [...] as a [...] "comedy number" [...] and [...] "a self-indulgent in-joke" [...] {{that appeared}} to show Harrison [...] "doubling down on efforts to alienate his audience", after the bad press he had received over the winter of 1974–75. On release, Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone said that the song [...] "might be Harrison's way of countering charges of humorlessness" [...] but that [...] "since neither Smith nor Harrison is very funny, it does more to confirm the charges." [...] In the NME, Neil Spencer referred {{to the image of}} Harrison with [...] "a chirpy <b>smirk</b> plastered across his dial" [...] as [...] "misleading", given the album's overall mood, and added: [...] "'His Names Is Legs (Ladies and Gentlemen)' is the odd track out because it's (ulp) not serious. It seems like an attempt to recapture some of the innocent light-heartedness of Beatle days." [...] Ray Coleman of Melody Maker predicted that Extra Texture would [...] "re-establish [...] as a powerful artist with an ear for unusual but attractive tunes allied to some quirky lyrics", and he described the closing song as an [...] "up-tempo splash of fun, and it jumps, too".|$|E
500|$|Kunis was {{nominated}} for multiple awards, including her first Golden Globe, for the 2010 film Black Swan. She played a rival ballet dancer to the main character, played by Natalie Portman. Director Darren Aronofsky cast Kunis in the film based on her performance in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and {{on the recommendation of}} co-star and close friend Natalie Portman. She underwent a training regimen that included cardiovascular exercise, a 1,200-calorie a day diet (she lost 20pounds that she regained after filming ended), and ballet classes for four hours a day, seven days a week. During the demanding production, she suffered injuries including a torn ligament and a dislocated shoulder. Black Swan received widespread acclaim from critics and {{was nominated}} for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The film grossed over $106.9million in the United States and Canada while grossing over $329 million worldwide. Reviews of Kunis's performance were positive, with Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter stating, [...] "Kunis makes a perfect alternate to Portman, equally as lithe and dark but a <b>smirk</b> of self-assurance in place of Portman's wide-eyed fearfulness." [...] Guy Lodge of In Contention also praised Kunis, saying, [...] "it's the cool, throaty-voiced Kunis who is the surprise package here, intelligently watching and reflecting her co-star in such a manner that we're as uncertain as Nina of her ingenuousness." [...] Kunis's performance won her the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best Young Actor or Actress at the 67th Venice International Film Festival, and earned her Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress. At the 37th annual Saturn Awards, she was also honored with the Best Supporting Actress award for her performance.|$|E

500|$|In early 2003, Nolan {{approached}} Warner Bros. {{with the}} idea {{to make a new}} Batman film. Fascinated by the character and story, he wanted to make a film grounded in a [...] "relatable" [...] world more reminiscent of a classical drama than a comic-book fantasy. Batman Begins, the biggest project Nolan had undertaken to that point, premiered in June 2005 to both critical acclaim and commercial success. Starring Christian Bale in the title role, along with Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson, the film revived the franchise, heralding a trend towards darker films which rebooted (or retold) backstories. It tells the origin story of the character from Bruce Wayne's initial fear of bats, the death of his parents, his journey to become Batman, and his fight against Ra's al Ghul's plot to destroy Gotham City. Praised for its psychological depth and contemporary relevance, Kyle Smith of The New York Post called it [...] "a wake-up call to the people who keep giving us cute capers about men in tights. It wipes the <b>smirk</b> {{off the face of the}} superhero movie." [...] Batman Begins was the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2005 in the United States and the year's ninth-highest-grossing film worldwide. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography and three BAFTA awards. On the film's 10th anniversary, Forbes published an article describing its influence: [...] "Reboot became part of our modern vocabulary, and superhero origin stories became increasingly en vogue for the genre. The phrase [...] "dark and gritty" [...] likewise joined the cinematic lexicon, influencing our perception of different approaches to storytelling not only in the comic book film genre but in all sorts of other genres as well." ...|$|E

Blender reporter Jon Dolan claims that Allen [...] "deploys a sugary melody as a Trojan horse for a smackdown on a douche-bag ex-boyfriend", as Rob Webb from Drowned in Sound called [...] "Smile" [...] an [...] "infectious slice of bouncing, carnival reggae that punches hard with its opening line: 'When you first left me / I was wanting more / But you were fucking that girl next door / What you do that for?,'" [...] and {{went on to say that}} the theme of the song is melancholy, [...] "set against breezy beats", and while not being [...] "an obvious TOTP contender on the surface, [...] is good but far from one of the LP's choice cuts". Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone gave a rather negative review, claiming the singer [...] "doesn't sound as if she's trying too hard", singing the song with a [...] "breezy sha-la-la lilt that just made the song seem even nastier". Later, he called Allen a [...] "theoretical pop princess, who just entered the breakup-song hall of fame". Dom Passantino of Stylus suggested that [...] "'Smile' gets burned off the lights by both Sean Paul and Abs when it comes to facsimiles of 'Uptown Top Ranking,' but neither of them could bring the quality of lyricism the singer does," [...] while Slant Magazine reporter Sal Cinquemani was baffled as to why the song, which she [...] "sings without a <b>smirk</b> of irony", is a UK chart-topper.|$|E

[...] The show ran five seasons on NBC from 1983 to 1987. It made Peppard known to a new generation and is arguably his best-known role. It has been reported that the role was originally written with James Coburn in mind, but Coburn declined and thus it went to Peppard. Peppard was reportedly annoyed by Mr. T upstaging him in his public image, and at one point in their relationship refused to speak directly to Mr. T. [...] Instead, he sent messages through intermediaries (including at times fellow cast members, particularly Dirk Benedict) and for this Peppard was occasionally portrayed by the press as not a team player.|$|E
