40|$|This course aims {{to provide}} {{students}} with an overview of statistical methods appropriate for the analysis of longitudinal data, or data collected on multiple units (individuals, states, dyads, countries) at more than one point in time. The majority of the course will focus on models for the analysis of “panel data, ” which (by convention) is used to describe data with relatively large number of units and relatively few time points. Shorter sections focus on models for “time-series-cross-section data ” (fewer units and many time points) and “event history analysis, ” which is used to model whether and when certain events occur (e. g. war, cabinet dissolution, Senate confirmation of Supreme Court justices). The emphasis throughout the class will be on taking advantage of the benefits that longitudinal data provide the researcher in making inferences about causal dynamics, {{while at the same time}} being sensitive to the specific problems and complexities that emerge when conducting longitudinal analyses. On the benefits <b>side,</b> <b>longitudinal</b> data provides the researcher with increased ability to: 1) model directly individual-level change and growth in dependent variables; 2) test alternative lag structures and models of reciprocal causality between variables; 3) estimate causal effects after controlling for the confounding effects of measurement error; 4) estimate models that control for unmeasured unit-specific effects or “unobserve...|$|E
40|$|The {{metazoan}} phylum Cycliophora includes small cryptic epibionts {{that live}} {{attached to the}} mouthparts of clawed lobsters. The life cycle is complex, with alternating sexual and asexual generations, and involves several sessile and free-living stages. So far, the morphological and genetic characterization of cycliophorans {{has been unable to}} clarify the phylogenetic position of the phylum. In this study, we add new details on the muscular anatomy of the feeding stage, the attached Prometheus larva, the dwarf male, and the female of one of the two hitherto described species, Symbion pandora. The musculature of the feeding stage is composed of myofibers that run longitudinally in the buccal funnel (two fibers) and in the trunk (variable number of fibers). The mouth opening is lined by a myoepithelial ring musculature. A complex myoepithelial sphincter is situated proximal to the anus. In the attached Prometheus larva, three longitudinal sets of myofilaments run dorsally, laterally, and ventrally along the entire anterior-posterior body axis. The muscular architecture of the dwarf male is complex, especially close to the penis, in the posterior part of the body. An X-shaped muscle structure is found on the dorsal side, whereas on the ventral <b>side,</b> <b>longitudinal</b> muscles and a V-shaped muscle structure are present. These muscles are complemented by additional dorsoventral muscles. The mesodermal muscle fibers attach to the cuticle via the epidermis in all life cycle stages studied herein. The musculature of the female {{is similar to that of}} the Pandora larva of Symbion antericanus and includes dorsoventral muscles and longitudinal muscles that run in the dorsal and ventral body region. Overall, our results reveal striking similarities in the muscular arrangement of the life cycle stages of both Symbion species. J. Morphol. 271 : 596 - 611, 2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of Free Electron Lasers (FEL) as a fourth generation of light sources is a breakthrough. FELs {{operating in the}} X-ray range (XFEL) allow one to carry out completely new experiments that probably most {{of the natural sciences}} would benefit. Self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) is the baseline FEL operation mode: the radiation pulse starts as a spontaneous emission from the electron bunch and is being amplified during an FEL process until it reaches saturation. The SASE FEL radiation usually has poor properties in terms of a spectral bandwidth or, on the other <b>side,</b> <b>longitudinal</b> coherence. Self-seeding is a promising approach to narrow the SASE bandwidth of XFELs significantly in order to produce nearly transform-limited pulses. It is achieved by the radiation pulse monochromatization {{in the middle of an}} FEL amplification process. Following the successful demonstration of the self-seeding setup in the hard X-ray range at the LCLS, there is a need for a self-seeding extension into the soft X-ray range. Here a numerical method to simulate the soft X-ray self seeding (SXRSS) monochromator performance is presented. It allows one to perform start-to-end self-seeded FEL simulations along with (in our case) GENESIS simulation code. Based on this method, the performance of the LCLS self-seeded operation was simulated showing a good agreement with an experiment. Also the SXRSS monochromator design developed in SLAC was adapted for the SASE 3 type undulator beamline at the European XFEL. The optical system was studied using Gaussian beam optics, wave optics propagation method and ray tracing to evaluate the performance of the monochromator itself. Wave optics analysis takes into account the actual beam wavefront of the radiation from the coherent FEL source, third order aberrations and height errors from each optical element. The monochromator design is based on a toroidal VLS grating working at a fixed incidence angle mounting without both entrance and exit slits. It is optimized for the spectral range of $ 300 - 1200 $~eV providing resolving power above $ 7000 $. The proposed monochromator is composed of three mirrors and the grating. Start-to-end simulation as a case study of the self-seeded European XFEL performance with a proposed SXRSS monochromator is presented. It shows that the laser pulse power reaches a TW-level with its spectral density about eighty times higher than that of the conventional SASE pulse at saturation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Retrofitting {{by plating}} {{structures}} {{has been found}} to be very efficient. However, tests have shown that externally bonded longitudinal plates are prone to premature debonding. Furthermore, a comprehensive study of published research has also shown that there can be large discrepancies between debonding mathematical models and tests. To overcome this problem and to allow structural engineers to adhesively bond plates with safety and efficiently, a structural engineering approach is suggested whereby many of the debonding mechanisms can be prevented by judicious detailing; this approach can be applied to tension face plates, compression face plates, side plates, U-sectioned plates, and angle-sectioned plates. Four continuous reinforced concrete beams have been retrofitted with adhesively bonded longitudinal plates and tested in order to illustrate this design approach, to directly compare the performance of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>side</b> plates with <b>longitudinal</b> tension face plates, to compare FRP plating with steel plating, and in particular to illustrate the effect of debonding on the sectional ductility of longitudinally plated continuous RC beams.
