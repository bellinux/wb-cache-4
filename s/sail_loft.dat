25|$|The life of {{the church}} {{congregation}} began in 1849, when a group of Christians from various denominations, who had been meeting informally in a <b>sail</b> <b>loft</b> in Port Adelaide, formed themselves into the 'Congregational Church of Port Adelaide'. The services were led by Rev. Matthew Hodge who was asked to cut-short his journey to Victoria (from England) and stay in South Australia instead. His first service was held on 30 September 1849 in the <b>sail</b> <b>loft,</b> but later that year a small stone church was built on the corner of St Vincent and Lipson Streets.|$|E

By developing {{a tool to}} help maneuver the large sails, by 1810, Forten had built {{up one of the}} most successful <b>sail</b> <b>lofts</b> in Philadelphia. He created the conditions he worked for in society, employing both black and white workers. Because of his business acumen, Forten became one of the wealthiest Philadelphians in the city, black or white.|$|R
50|$|By 1886, {{shipbuilding}} was surpassed by {{the lime}} business, which had twelve manufacturers employing 1,000 workers. Nevertheless, Rockland had {{three or more}} shipyards, a marine railway, five <b>sail</b> <b>lofts</b> and two boatbuilders. Other industries included three grain mills, two foundries, three carriage factories, six lumber mills, two machine shops, three cooperies, one tannery, four granite and marble works, two boot and shoe factories, and four printing offices. Fishing was also important. Fleets of Friendship Sloops sailed between the harbor and fishing grounds across Penobscot Bay.|$|R
2500|$|In 1916, a 16-piece {{band from}} the {{battleship}} [...] {{was ordered to}} the Washington Navy Yard to augment a 17-piece band aboard the Presidential Yacht [...] The new unit {{became known as the}} [...] "Washington Navy Yard Band" [...] and was given rehearsal space near the power plant's coal pile. The increasing tempo of the band's duties led the bandmaster to seek more suitable quarters in the yard's [...] "Sail Loft", and sailmakers were soon cutting and stitching their canvas to the rhythms of the music. The United States Navy Band still occupies the <b>Sail</b> <b>Loft</b> as its headquarters and rehearsal hall.|$|E
2500|$|The 19th-century {{seafaring}} village contains {{nearly all}} the types of general and specialized trades associated with building and operating a sailing fleet. They include a chandlery, <b>sail</b> <b>loft,</b> ropewalk, cooperage, shipping agent's office, printing office, bank, and others. [...] Also included is The Spouter Tavern, open seasonally and serving [...] "travelers' fare". [...] Each building is used both to show the original activity and to display multiple examples of objects sold or constructed; for instance, the nautical instrument shop displays sextants, nautical timepieces, and the like. [...] Demonstrations at the cooperage show how casks are assembled.|$|E
2500|$|The {{construction}} and historical {{design of the}} ship was made by Joakim Severinsson. The blueprints for the ship was approved by international classification society Det Norske Veritas in November 1995. All that {{was left of the}} Eriksbergs wharf were two-thirds of building berth number six, the large gantry crane and the dry dock. Around this, a new shipyard for building the Götheborg began to grow. A new ship's hall was built over the building berth, a timber workshop, a forge, a rigging workshop with a <b>sail</b> <b>loft</b> and some modern facilities such as a restaurant, offices and conference rooms were also added to the site. Since the wharf was built on reclaimed land, it seemed very apt to call it Terra Nova ("new land" [...] in Latin) just like the wharf where the original vessel had been built.|$|E
50|$|The {{island has}} three yacht clubs {{situated}} on the Eastchester Bay side of the island.

The North Minneford Yacht Club and the South Minneford Yacht Club are on the east side of the island. There are two active <b>sail</b> <b>lofts</b> (UK-Halsey and Doyle). The island also has several commercial marinas.|$|R
50|$|The town prospered in {{the early}} 19th century as a port and ship {{building}} center. Around 1840, two of seven recorded millionaires in the United States were Thomaston sea captains. Other industries included two gristmills, two sawmills and planing mills, three <b>sail</b> <b>lofts,</b> brickyards, cask manufacturing and a marble works. Lime had been manufactured here since 1734 in kilns. Thomaston is still home to Jeff's Marine, Inc. and Lyman Morse Boatbuilding, builders of custom power and sailing yachts. Located on the St. George River, Lyman Morse Boatbuilding sits on a site where wooden schooners have been built for over 200 years.|$|R
50|$|While {{pursuing}} a second {{career as an}} itinerant preacher in the 1940s, Pont painted not only Biblical themes, but also landscapes in thirty states, as well as Canada and several European countries. Working with equal skill in oil, watercolor, ink, and printmaking, most of Pont’s work remained nautical. In retired life he devoted himself to capturing the charm of the New England coast before all the 19th century <b>sail</b> <b>lofts,</b> docks and buildings were demolished. Giving up the ministry as a full-time occupation in the late 1940s, Pont turned again to commercial art for a living, and served as assistant art director for the New York publisher Grosset & Dunlap from 1954 {{until his retirement in}} 1963. Later, Pont taught art for Darien High School evening classes, and the Famous Artists School in Westport, both in Connecticut.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his shipbuilding company and merchant fleet, T. J. Southard was a major contributor in numerous other ways to {{the economic and social}} development of his home town of Richmond and the surrounding locale. He founded the Southard Cotton Mill, as well as a mineral spring business that sold its product nationally. He owned numerous businesses collectively employing hundreds of people, including four shipyards, a brass foundry, grist mill, saw and planing mill, furniture factory, <b>sail</b> <b>loft,</b> bakery, edged tool store, drugstore and dry goods and West Indies goods store, the latter alone turning over $50,000 annually in 1840s dollars. Additionally, he worked to bring other businesses and business infrastructure to Richmond, including shoe factories, a bag mill, the telegraph and railroad. He is credited with establishing several business blocks in Richmond along with some fifty houses, and he owned and rented farmland in the locality. It was said of him that there was scarcely an [...] "institution in town he hasn't a corner in." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1900 {{most of the}} {{infrastructure}} required {{for the production of}} high calibre wooden boats was in place: pier, slipway, sawmills, workshops, building-sheds, stores, paint shop, engine house, <b>sail</b> <b>loft</b> and workers' houses. These were the golden years of the yard, during which they built classic racing yachts: 15-metre Shimna (later Slec) (Willian Fife III, 1907); 15-metre Tritonia (later Jeano and Cisne Branco - Alfred Mylne, 1910), 12-metre Heatherbell (Thomas Glen-Coats, 1907); 12-metre Cyra (Alfred Mylne, 1909) - note : renamed Arcula around 1934 and destroyed by the Wehrmacht 1943 or 1944 who killed the owner Frits Johannsen (DK); 10-metre Pampero (1912); 8-metre Novena (1908); 5-metre Mungo (1908). [...] Elrhuna, a [...] sloop was designed by Alexander in 1904, and due {{to the quality of the}} wood and sound construction she still races regularly on the west coast of Scotland. The first of many motor boats were built in 1905, among them a luxurious [...] teak-built 'carvel' motor launch ordered for the S Y Nahma, which was the last boat designed by George Lennox Watson. The development of early steam boats by Alexander provided the necessary expertise to build 7 steam powered launches for the Admiralty in the years leading up to World War I.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{sandstone}} {{on the ground}} level of number 19 is 18th century in style, it was unveiled in the 1960s, the building however received much of its present appearance in 1876. [...] During the following decades, the proprietors then started to add and relocate {{the doors of the}} building, sealing one door to replace a window with a new door, ten years later reverting the arrangement in many aspects typical for the faith of the buildings in the old town. [...] The building was occupied by the tavern Riga during the 17th and 18th century, and during 60 years from 1917 by a <b>sail</b> <b>loft.</b> [...] South of Number 19 is Skottgränd, an alley named after the Scotsmen who settled here in the 17th century, supposedly to own their living either as merchants or warriors. [...] On Number 2 was the tavern Bacchus in the early 18th century, Number 6 was a storage as the still operational derrick show, and over the door of Number 3 is the inscription NON DOMUS DOMINUM SED DOMINUS DOMUM, roughly: 'A dominion doesn't make a lord, but a lord makes a domesticity'. [...] One of the two shuttered windows on the southern side has iron detailing 17th century in style, but both of them are from 1873 when the façade of Number 21 was completed together with its portal feature featuring sculptural leaf garland and ductile wooden decorations. [...] Next to the vault leading to Stora Hoparegränd (a name derived from hooper, the profession of making barrels; English: cooper) is just enough space for the narrow front door of Number 23; the portal of which is 18th century in style but was added to the building probably in the mid-19th century, a few decades before the shop door got flanked by its fluted wooden pilasters.|$|E

Despite little time for sailing Andrew and Felix have sailed two regattas together {{in the past two years}} [...] "Just for Fun" [...] but managed to finish 1st in the 2005 Topcat K1 World Championships and 3rd in the 2006 F18 World Championships. Andrew is currently spending time sailing in the Star class to develop a new range of <b>sail</b> for the <b>loft.</b> Both the development process and the production techniques are heavily orientated around computer software. Sail making has moved on from an art to an exact science. On average the process we adopt to develop sails in new classes brings us to a very competitive product within three prototypes. This is far quicker than most other One Design lofts can manage who often make a not stop progression of random changes searching for any hint of improvement in performance.In 2007 Andrew build a second home in Australia on the banks of the Clarence River. Here he has an extensive design loft where he can develop sails and escape the European winter. Although he spends more time these days designing sails he still remains one of the world's leading multihull sailors.|$|R
2500|$|James Cook led three {{separate}} voyages to chart unknown {{areas of the}} globe for the British Empire. It was on his third and final voyage that he encountered what is known today as the Islands of Hawaii. He first sighted the islands on 18 January 1778. [...] He anchored off {{the west coast of}} the island of Kauai near Waimea and met inhabitants to trade and obtain water and food. On 2 February 1778, Cook continued on to the coast of North America and Alaska searching for a Northwest Passage for approximately nine months. He returned to the island chain to resupply, initially exploring the coasts of Maui and the big island and trading with locals, then making anchor in Kealakekua Bay in January 1779. Cook and his crew was initially welcomed and treated with honor. He and his men were given much food, various gifts from the islands inhabitants. They were shown traditional native performances and ceremonies, and generally treated as privileged guests, as his arrival coincided with the Makahiki, a festival celebrating the yearly harvest while worshipping the Hawaiian deity Lono. However, after he and the crews of both ships, [...] and , left the islands, the festival season had ended and the season for battle and war had begun under the worship and rituals for Kūkaʻilimoku, the god of war. Although Cook's sequential visits may have coincided with native traditional seasons, the natives had soured on Cook and his men by the time of Cook's initial departure. John Ledyard was the only american aboard Cook's ship during this time and the only citizen aboard the ship not loyal to the crown. Ledyard was present during the events leading up to and during Cook's death, and wrote a detailed, neutral account of the events in his journals [...] During Cook's initial visit, he attempted to barter and forcibly stole the wood used to border the natives sacred [...] "Morai" [...] burial ground, used for high ranking individuals and depictions of their gods. Ledyard says in his journals, Cook offered two iron hatchets for the wooden border around the Morai and when the dismayed and insulted chiefs refused, Cook proceeded to give orders to ascend the Morai, break down the fence and load the boats with it. John Ledyard quotes in his journal: [...] "The poor dismayed chief's dreading his (Cook's) displeasure, which they saw approaching followed him upon the Morai to behold the fence that enclosed the mansions of their noble ancestors, and the images of their gods torn to pieces by a handful of rude strangers without the power, or at least without the resolution of opposing their sacrilegious depredations. When Cook had ascended the Morai he once more offered the hatchets to the chiefs. It was a very unequal price if the honest chiefs would have accepted of the bribe and Cook offered it only to evade the imputation of taking their property without payment." [...] [...] John Ledyard also tells of an episode where Captain Clerke accused a native chieftain friend of stealing the Resolution's jolly boat. The boat was soon found unstolen and the native chief soured from the false accusation. After staying in the bay for 19 days, Cook and his two ships sailed out of the bay. John Ledyard goes on to say in his journal: [...] "On the evening of the (January) 15th we struck our tents, and everything was taken on board, and it was very manifestly much to the satisfaction of the natives. A little after dark an old house that stood {{on the corner of the}} Morai took fire and burned down. This we supposed was occasioned by our people carelessly leaving their fire near it, but it was not the case. The natives burnt it themselves to show us the resentment they now entertained towards us, on account of our using it without their consent, and indeed manifestly against their consent. We had made a <b>sail</b> <b>loft</b> of one part of it, and a hospital for our sick for the other part, though it was evidently esteemed by the natives as holy as the rest of the Morai, and ought to have been considered by us." [...] On the 6th of February Cook's ships unmoored and left Kealakekua bay. They were met with an unexpected hard gale which wrenched the mainmast of the Resolution. On February 11th, the Resolution again entered Kealakekua bay on the night of 13 February. [...] Ledyard quotes in his journal: [...] "Our return to this bay was as disagreeable to us as it was to the inhabitants, for we were reciprocally tired of each other. They had been oppressed and were weary of our prostituted alliance.....It was also equally evident from the looks of the natives as well as every other appearance that our friendship was at an end, and that we had nothing to do but to hasten our departure to some different island where our vices were not known, and where our intrinsic virtues might gain us another short space of being wondered at..." [...] While anchored in Kealakekua Bay, one of only two long boats (lifeboats used to ferry to/from ship/shore) was stolen by the Hawaiians, testing the foreigners' reaction to see how far they could go with such a significant loss. The Hawaiians had begun openly challenging the foreigners. In retaliation, and in an attempt to force good behavior on the natives, Cook attempted to kidnap the aliʻi nui of the island of Hawaii,Kalaniʻōpuʻu. Possibly being quite sick at this point, Cook made what were later described as a series of mistakes. The idea or suggestion that the Native Hawaiians considered Cook to be the God Lono himself is considered to be inaccurate and is attributed to William Bligh. It is possible that some Hawaiians may have used the name of Lono as a metaphor when describing Cook or other possible explanations other than Hawaiians mistaking the explorer for their own deity.|$|E
