40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} a new {{anticorrosion}} pigment, synthesized on a core-shell basis. For its syntheses a <b>starting</b> <b>substance</b> is used that forms the lamellar shaped core; namely lamellar zinc. The cover of the core is represented by zinc oxide, which is in fact partly oxidized lamellar zinc core, and is created during the calcination of the pigment.

The formula for the prepared pigment is then defined as MexZn 1 -xFe 2 O 4 /Zn and the formula of thin ferrite layer is MexZn 1 -xFe 2 O 4 (where Me = Ca, Mg). Due to its shape, this anticorrosion pigment includes another anticorrosion effect, the so called “barrier effect”.

Life-science inspired analytical approaches were successfully applied to study the reactions of BADGE with food ingredients, for example, amino acids and sugars. An improved mass balance of BADGE was achieved by selective detection of reaction products of BADGE with low molecular weight food components, using a successful combination of stable isotopes of BADGE and analysis by LC coupled to fluorescence detection (FLD) and high-resolution mass spectrometric (MS) detection. Furthermore, proteomics approaches showed that BADGE also reacts with peptides (from protein digests in model systems) and with proteins in foods.

30|$|Much has {{happened}} since Rachel Carson wrote Silent Spring [1]. One no longer needs to define sustainability. However, its implication {{in the context of}} chemistry may be worth elaborating. Chemists are viewed as being largely responsible for using natural resources and (often) simultaneously hurting the environment. As Jenck et al. [2] pointed out, “Chemical industry represents a significant part of world trade and economic activity”. So, one cannot suddenly stop the operation of chemical industries. The search for alternatives led the chemists to formulate 12 principles of green chemistry [3]; defining parameters like E factor, effective mass yield and mass intensity to judge how green a particular chemical process is [4]. A sustainable chemical process does not need an end of the pipe remediation step. So in that sense, it {{can be viewed as a}} subset of environmental chemistry which includes (and in fact focuses more on) waste treatment, detoxification and degradation of pollutants. Use of waste as a resource material to obtain value added products, however should be viewed as a part of Sustainable Chemistry.

Homeopathic remedies are made via iterated shaking and dilution, in ethanol or in water, from a <b>starting</b> <b>substance.</b> Remedies of potency 12 C or higher are ultra-dilute (UD), i. e. contain zero molecules of the starting material. Various hypotheses have been advanced {{to explain how}} a UD remedy might be different from unprepared solvent.

High sensitivity proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has not previously been used to look for evidence of differences between UD remedies and controls. Methods Homeopathic remedies made in water were studied via high sensitivity proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

The very common use of caffeine and pentoxifylline in therapies, each of them combined with many other drugs and drug supplements for improving peripheral blood circulation raises the attention for screening cocrystals of these drugs (2). 	 During the last years, an increased interest for research in pharmaceutical cocrystals has been registered, using different strategies. A promising approach is {{to make use of}} the molecular recognition properties of the functional groups and their allocations in entire structures of the molecules which, depending on the polarity and atom’s electronegativity, are linked one to another by H-bonds (3). Hence, cocrystals represent multicomponent complexes where the Charge Transfer (CT) or Electron Donor-Acceptor (EDA) Interactions between two different molecules may determine the crystal packing that influences the solid-state properties of the cocrystal itself, and consequently the biopharmaceutical profile of the API included in the pharmaceutical cocrystals (4). 	For the purpose of this initial screening of cocrystallization of the methylxanthine derivatives caffeine and pentoxifylline, three different types of Cocrystal Formers (or coformers, CF) [acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), alpha-Lipoic acid (ALA) and p-Coumaric acid (PCA) ] have been selected on the base of their very common use in therapy in association with caffeine and pentoxifylline, respectively, as well as of the matching of proton acceptor/donor groups for each methylxanthine derivative with each of the three selected CFs. 	Observation of the cocrystallized samples done by using Microscopy, and gained Raman and FT- IR Spectra indicate the formation of a new solid crystalline phase that is different from the solid phases of the <b>starting</b> <b>substances</b> prior the cocrystallization procedure. In addition, assignation of Raman and FT-IR spectra of the pure <b>starting</b> <b>substances</b> and their cocrystalized samples imply formation of cocrystals.

Opium was the most common used substance (96. 9 %) and inhalation was the preferred pattern of use (52. 7 %). Majority of addicted patients were simple workers (44 %). Based on educational levels, 57. 2 % of opium dependents have had primary education (under high school). Eighty two (62. 5 %) of addicted groups believed that after starting opium, their cardiovascular function and chest pain had been improved. Although before starting opium use 58 (44. 6 %) of them have had this belief Conclusion: The prevalence of opium addiction in CABG patients is relatively high, and the majority of addicted patients are on this belief that opiates have positive effects on improvement of their chest pain and cardiovascular function. Because the effects of opioids on chest pain are palliative, the necessity of education for correction of this idea has been identified...|$|E
40|$|Inhalant {{abuse is}} a pervasive, yet under-recognized fonn of {{substance}} abuse that crosses demographic, ethnic and socioeconomic boundaries, causing significant morbidity and mortality in school-aged and older children. Internationally, inhalant abuse is rampant among street children in many urban centers, in both developed and developing countries, and represents a global health issue. WHOestimates that globally, 25 %to 90 % of street children indulge in substance use (WHO, 1997). India accounts for {{the highest number of}} street children in the world. The transient nature of this population renders it difficult to quote exact numbers, but estimates range from 11 million (UNICEF, 1994) to around 18 million (Human Rights Watch, 1996). Running away exposes children to stressful life on the streets, which accompanied by lack of parental care and supervision and easy access to intoxicating substances, creates an atmosphere conducive ~, for indulging in substance use. Astudy {{of substance abuse}} among street children in Delhi in 2002 revealed that about 57 % of street {{children between the ages of}} 6 and 16 had indulged in some form of substance abuse, the agents of choice being nicotine (44. 5 %) and inhalants (24. 3 %). Even more disturbing was the fact that the minimum age at <b>starting</b> <b>substance</b> abuse was 5. 5 years. Little research exists concerning treatment needs and successful treatment modalities specific to inhalant users. As with other types of substance abuse, the most effective way to curtail use is through broad prevention efforts. Limiting the availability of volatile substances is impractical, because they constitute products that are universally available, legal and have legitimate uses. Primary prevention is through education paired with skills-building, working with families, schools, communities, media and other potential change agents. Prevention programs also include community readiness models, street outreach programs, drop-in and residential treatment centers, and individual, group, and family counseling in a variety of settings. Residential treatment has not been a sufficient response to widespread inhalant abuse. My experience in the field suggested that working on changing the mindsets of male street inhalant abusers had the potential to bring about sustained behavioural change. In an effort to portray children's own voices as citizens and their capabilities as agents of change, I have utilised participatory action research that incorporated feedback from the field into the development ofpractical interventions and investigated treatment models (such as cognitivebehavioral therapy) effective for adolescents. My practice has been reflective, embedded in the circumstances of children's lives and issues and responsive to changing needs. - 0 Myresearch has demonstrated that a paradigmatic shift can take place in street inhalant abusers through a guided thought process, essential for informed choice. This cognitive process has helped the street inhalants make the transition from a mindset dominated by instant gratification, living for the day and impulsive decision making to a well-thought-out, reflective and cognitive approach. This research has reconfirmed my belief that sustained cognitive inputs can bring about and identity change and long term behavioural changes provided the adolescents have strong positive intentions, efforts and motivations to change their situations within a friendly, guided environment.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the preparation of chiral shift reagents sodium [(R) - and (S) - 1, 2 -diaminopropane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetate]samarate, for short Sm-(R) -pdta and Sm-(S) -pdta. These reagents {{have the ability to}} differentiate NMR signals of enantiomers of amino acids in an aqueous environment. The main aim of this work was to develop a new, efficient and cheap method of the preparation of these reagents which would enable their routine use in laboratory practice, because these reagents are commercially available only in limited quantities and at high price. This work describes simplifield method of separation of racemic 1, 2 -diaminopropane to its enantiomers from easily available <b>starting</b> <b>substances,</b> L-tartaric acid and racemic 1, 2 -diaminopropane. We also developed and optimized a new process of synthesis of the key intermediate, (R) - and (S) - 1, 2 -diaminopropane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid from (R) - and (S) - 1, 2 -diaminopropane dihydrochloride, with a new synthetic step involving tetrabenzylester of this acid and its deprotection by hydrogenolysis without contamination by extraneous ions. This process affords very pure anhydrous acid in high yield. Finally, the target complexes Sm-(R) -pdta and Sm-(S) -pdta were successfully prepared from (R) - and (S) - 1, 2 -diaminopropane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid [...] ...|$|R
