50|$|In operation, {{all three}} discs of a Schmidt {{coupling}} rotate with equal velocity. The bearing-mounted connections of links to discs are spaced 120° apart on same-diameter pitch circles. The {{distance between the}} shafts can be varied steplessly between the minimum value and a maximum of twice {{the length of the}} links. While the coupling in undulating, there is no phase <b>shift</b> between <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Shafts may be sunk by {{conventional}} drill and blast or mechanised means. The industry is gradually attempting to <b>shift</b> further towards <b>shaft</b> boring but a reliable method {{to do so}} {{has yet to be}} developed.|$|R

Patient has marked instability, shortening and adduction. Note the femoral head in the acetabulum, the upward <b>shift</b> of the <b>shaft,</b> the remains of the neck and the attempt by the shaft to buttress the head...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the small}} mining village of Kitamatsu, on the {{southern}} Japanese island of Kyushu, two miners have gone missing. The two men, Goro and Yoshi, had brawled earlier that day, and after they entered the mine to start their <b>shift,</b> the <b>shaft</b> had quickly flooded. Shigeru Kawamura (Kenji Sahara), a tunneling and safety engineer at the mine, heads below to investigate and makes a gruesome discovery: Yoshi's lacerated corpse. Above ground, a doctor examines Yoshi, and discovers {{the cause of death}} to be a series of deep gashes caused by an abnormally sharp object. Some of the miners and their families begin to discuss the possibility of the involvement of Goro, who is still unaccounted for, in the death. Shigeru is personally affected by this incident, since his fiancée Kiyo (Yumi Shirakawa) is also Goro's sister.|$|R
50|$|The F23 has two gearsets on each {{of three}} {{parallel}} shafts - the input shaft, the output shaft, and the intermediate shaft. This three-shaft (also called three-axis) design results {{in a very short}} axial length for better packaging. There are three separate <b>shift</b> fork <b>shafts,</b> which hold three shift forks to activate the synchronizer rings for the two gearsets {{on each of}} the three gear <b>shafts.</b> The <b>shift</b> forks are activated by a cable system. The clutch release bearing is operated by a concentric slave cylinder that surrounds the input shaft in the clutch housing. A concentric slave cylinder allows more linear clutch feel than an external lever-actuated clutch and release bearing. The input shaft carries the 3rd and 4th gear synchronizer, the intermediate shaft carries the 1st and 2nd gear synchronizer, and the output shaft carries the 5th and reverse gear synchronizer. The aluminium case contains a conventional final drive gearset.|$|R
50|$|LHD have {{powerful}} prime movers, advanced {{drive train}} technology, heavy planetary axles, four-wheel drive, articulated steering and ergonomic controls. Their narrower, longer and lower profile make them {{most suitable for}} underground application where height and width is limited. As the length is not a limitation in underground tunnel and decline LHD are designed with sufficient length. The length improves axial weight distribution and bucket capacity can be enhanced. The two-part construction with central articulation helps in tracking and maneuverability. In mining there is limitation for shifting heavy equipment. Sometimes, an LHD has to be <b>shifted</b> through a <b>shaft</b> while dismantled.|$|R
2500|$|The wreck site lies at a {{depth of}} [...] to [...] of water {{approximately}} [...] off North Head. The wreck site is on sand away from any reef structure and completely intact but significantly buried under the sand to a level approximately the same as what would have been the deck level. It is a small site with just the two boilers (about 800 – 1000mm dia by 2.5m long approx) a broken engine and paddle wheel <b>shaft</b> (<b>shifted</b> by about 1 meter to the starboard) visible above the sand line. The sharp cutting shape of the bow and stern can just be made out with the twin (bow and stern) rudder posts just above the sand level.|$|R
50|$|A paddle {{actuated}} {{hydraulic clutch}} was designed {{which had a}} custom master cylinder concentric with the steering <b>shaft.</b> <b>Shifting</b> was originally via a large off-the-shelf electric solenoid (actually two solenoids inline which acted in opposite directions), but the windings {{for one of the}} internal solenoids burned out the Sunday before the VIR competition (the team left on the Tuesday morning after this). Parts were gathered from old (~10 years previous or more) pneumatic shifting setups that were stored in various places, and the following day CO2 tanks and various other parts were bought at a paint ball supply store and a pneumatic shifter was on the car by 4am Tuesday morning. This system used the same switches that actuated the original shifter, which were mounted on a collar on the steering <b>shaft.</b> The <b>shift</b> paddles pushed small pushrods which were in holes drilled in the quick release and protruded when the paddle was pulled to push the microswitch levers.|$|R
