Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations have a variable incidence rate ranging between 15 - 33 %, and the safest treatment is transcatheter embolotherapy. Haemmorrhages from the gastrointestinal tract occur in 10 - 40 % of patients with HHT localized in duodenum and colon and can be treated with endoscopy and laser coagulation, but this procedure is not efficacious for vascular anomalies in small intestine since this site cannot be easily reached. The prevalence of cerebrovascular malformations in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia patients is 5 - 27 %, and there are several types described including telangiectasias, cavernous angiomas, arteriovenous malformations, and aneurysms. Cerebrovascular malformations can be treated by: neurovascular surgery, embolization, and stereotactic radiosurgery, but the appropriate course of action for dealing with asymptomatic cerebrovascular malformations is still debated. The most common symptom in HHT patients is epistaxis, which can sometimes be so profuse that it requires multiple transfusions and <b>iron</b> supplementation. <b>Nose</b> bleeds begin before 10 years of age and become more severe in later decades.

40|$|Iron {{homeostasis}} in prokaryotic cells {{appears to}} be regulated essentially {{at the level of}} the genome by the Fur protein. When iron is in short supply the uptake and assimilation pathways are de-repressed and siderophores are synthesized together with the outer, inner (plasma) membrane, periplasmic and cytosolic components necessary for the uptake of ferri-siderophores. When iron is no longer limiting the Fe 2 + the Fur complex acts as a transcriptional repressor, and shuts down the synthesis of all the components of iron assimilation. In euykarotic cells, iron homeostasis is dependent upon the iron regulatory factor (IRF), a cytoplasmic protein that can bind to specific <b>stem</b> loops, <b>iron</b> responsive elements(IREs) on the messenger ribonucleic acid molecules (mRNAs) of proteins involved in iron storage (ferritin), utilization (erythroid delta-aminolaevulinate synthase, AIS), and uptake (transferrin receptor). During ion depletion the IRE is in a high affinity form, which, by binding strongly to the corresponding mRNAs, down regulates iron storage and utilization, while up-regulating transferrin receptor expression. When the cells are iron replete, IRF binding to IREs is weak, allowing transferrin receptor mRNA to be degraded. In this paper it is shown that in physiological conditions of iron overload and depletion, IRF functions irt vivo in the manner already described for in vitro models. The nature and the speciation of the various iron species within the low molecular weight pool of eukaryotic cells remains unclear...|$|R

However, the actual mechanism behind the plant-PGPB interaction is poorly understood, and the literature is scarce regarding the thermochemical pretreatability and enzymatic degradability of biomass derived from PGPB-inoculated plants. Most recent transcriptional analyses of PGPB strain Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN inoculating potato in literature and Arabidopsis in our present study have revealed the expression of genes for ferritin and the biosynthesis and transport of siderophores (i. e. the molecules with high affinity for iron), respectively. The expression of such genes in the shoots of PsJN-inoculated plants prompted us to propose that PsJN-inoculation can improve the host plant’s iron uptake and accumulation, which facilitates the downstream plant biomass pretreatment and conversion to simple sugars. In this study, we employed B. phytofirmans PsJN to inoculate the Arabidopsis thaliana plants, and conducted the first investigation for its effects on the biomass yield, the anatomical organization of <b>stems,</b> the <b>iron</b> accumulation, and the pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis of harvested biomass.

30|$|Cell {{viability}} and lethality {{are the two}} parameters {{which are}} {{used to measure the}} toxicity caused by the nanoparticles. Among the various nanoparticles, carbon nanoparticles (CNTs) are used most frequently for assessment of viability and lethality of cells. They are widely used in chemical, industrial and biomedical applications due to their unique properties [97, 98]. They are synthesized as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SW-CNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MW-CNTs) [99]. The anti-microbial properties of CNTs have been observed by studies in various bacteria due to the mechanical damage caused by the nanotubes [100, 101, 102]. A recent study has indicated that functionalized CNTs affect soil bacterial diversity [25]. The toxicity studies on a micro crustacean (Daphnia magna), freshwater microalgae (Raphidocelis subcapitata and Chlorella vulgaris) and a fish (Oryzias latipes) revealed inhibited the growth of the algae C. vulgaris and R. subcapitata with effective SW-CNT concentration 30.96  mg/mL and 29.99  m/L, respectively [103].

Another toxicity study which was performed on rat mesenchymal stem cells at 0.1  mg/mL for 2  days reported a decrease in cell viability [106]. Silica nanoparticles were also reported for toxicity to human keratinocytes. In a study, the toxicity of the silica nanoparticles at 30 – 300  µg/mL was evaluated using CHK (human keratinocytes).

40|$|Collagen is an {{extremely}} stable protein that comprises 90 % of the organic fraction of bone. Specific nutritional deficiencies and diseases are known to impair collagen synthesis and alter its typical amino acid composition. This study investigates the possibility that altered amino acid composition {{is evident in the}} pathological individuals of a large, well-preserved collection of archaeological remains. ^ Femoral cortical bone samples from 59 adults from the NAX cemetery (A. D. 350 - 550) near Wadi Halfa, Sudan, and five modern samples are examined for collagen preservation and amino acid composition. Elemental analysis of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen content indicates that protein preservation in the NAX samples is excellent. Only two have nitrogen contents below that of fresh bone, although seven samples display C/N ratios suggestive of diagenesis. Amino acid analyses, using both ninhydrin and OPA detection to obtain complete profiles, reveal depletion of the less stable amino acids (specifically, serine, methionine, isoleucine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine) and low levels of breakdown products in the NAX sample, which otherwise retains the characteristic composition of collagen. ^ Porotic hyperostosis in the Nubian population is a childhood condition <b>stemming</b> from <b>iron</b> deficiency anemia. It was anticipated that amino acids dependent on iron for their formation [...] hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine [...] would be depleted in this group in comparison to a nonpathological group, however, only phenylalanine is reduced significantly. The early onset of osteoporosis in the ancient Nubian population also is nutritionally linked, however, no significant differences are found. A final group comprised of individuals with both porotic hyperostosis and osteoporosis reveals a significant elevation of a breakdown product but no other differences. ^ The results indicate that differential degradation of amino acids occurs as a consequence of postmortem diagenesis. The lack of statistically significant differences attributable to pathology suggests that the biological stress was not chronic or severe enough to alter amino acid composition. Normal collagen synthesis appears to be maintained at the expense of mineralization. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Despite {{the wide}} range of applications, there is a serious lack of {{information}} on the impact of the nanoparticles on human health and the environment. The present study was done to determine the range of dangerous concentrations of iron oxide nanoparticle and their effects on mouse embryonic <b>stem</b> cells. Methods: <b>Iron</b> oxide nanoparticles with less than 20 nanometers diameter were encapsulated by a PEG-phospholipid. The suspension of iron oxide nanoparticles was prepared using the culture media and cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Results: MTT assay was used to examine the cytotoxicity of iron oxide nanoparticle s. Royan B 1 cells were treated with medium containing different concentrations (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 µg/ml) of the iron oxide nanoparticle.

Conclusion: The main mechanism of nanoparticles action is still unknown, but in vivo and in vitro studies in different environments suggest that they are capable of producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, they may {{have an effect on the}} concentration of intracellular calcium, activation of transcription factors, and changes in cytokine.

You know the unadulterated pleasure of that first clear morning in the Hills when a month's solid idleness lies before the loafer, and {{the scent of the}} deodars mixes with the scent of the meditative cigar. That was my portion when I stepped through the violet-studded long grass into forgotten little Japanese cemeteries--all broken pillars and lichened tablets--till I found, under a cut in the hillside, the big bell of Kioto--twenty feet of green bronze hung inside a fantastically roofed shed of wooden beams. A beam, by the way, is a beam in Japan; anything under a foot thick is a stick. These beams were the best parts of big trees, clamped with bronze and iron. A knuckle rapped lightly on the lip of the bell--it was not more than five feet from the ground--made the great monster breathe heavily, and the blow of a stick started a hundred shrill-voiced echoes round the darkness of its dome. At one side, guyed by half a dozen small hawsers, hung a battering-ram, a twelve-foot spar bound with <b>iron,</b> its <b>nose</b> pointing full-butt at a chrysanthemum in high relief on the belly of the bell. Then, by special favour of Providence, which always looks after the idle, they began to sound sixty strokes. Half a dozen men swung the ram back and forth with shoutings and outcries, till it had gathered sufficient way, and the loosened ropes let it hurl itself against the chrysanthemum. The boom of the smitten bronze was swallowed up by the earth below and the hillside behind, so that its volume was not proportionate {{to the size of the}} bell, exactly as the men had said. An English ringer would have made thrice as much of it. But then he would have lost the crawling jar that ran through rock-stone and pine for twenty yards round, that beat through the body of the listener and died away under his feet like the shock of a distant blasting. I endured twenty strokes and removed myself, not in the least ashamed of mistaking the sound for an earthquake. Many times since I have heard the bell speak when I was far off. It says B-r-r-r very deep down in its throat, but when you have once caught the noise you will never forget it. And so much for the big bell of Kioto.|$|R

Using haptoglobin (Hp) and hemopexin (Hx) the body defends itself against cell-free Hb, yet mechanisms of protection against oxidative harm from Mb are unclear. Mb may be implicated in oxidative damage both within the myocyte and in circulation following rhabdomyolysis. Data from the literature correlate rhabdomyolysis with the induction of Heme Oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1), suggesting that either the enzyme or its reaction products are involved in oxidative protection. We hypothesized that carbon monoxide (CO), a product, might attenuate Mb damage, especially since CO is a specific ligand for heme iron. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) was chosen as a substrate in circulation and myosin (My) as a myocyte component. Using oxidation targets, LDL and My, the study compared the antioxidant potential of CO in Mb-mediated oxidation with the antioxidant potential of Hp in Hb-mediated oxidation.

The extract also revert decreased sucrase and lactase activity in treated iron deficient rats when compared with untreated rats. The efficacy of the extract may be due to its components including iron, saponin and cardiac glycosides. This work proposed 25  mg/kg body weight as the likely non-lethal effective dose of the extract for the treatment of anaemia, though, further toxicological studies are still required to ascertain this claim...|$|R

These cells showed robust labeling in vitro without impairment of their functional properties, the viability of which were evaluated by proliferation kinetic and ultrastructural analyzes. Thus, labeled cells were infused into striatum of adult male rats of animal model that mimic late onset of Parkinson&# 39;s disease and, after 15 days, {{it was observed that}} cells migrated along the medial forebrain bundle to the substantia nigra as hypointense spots in T 2 magnetic resonance imaging. These data were supported by short-term magnetic resonance imaging. Studies were performed in vivo, which showed that about 5 × 105 cells could be efficiently detected in the short term following infusion. Our results indicate that these labeled cells can be efficiently tracked in a neurodegenerative disease model.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of thelabeling of umbilical cord vein derived mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells withsuperparamagnetic <b>iron</b> oxide nanoparticles coated with dextran andcomplexed to a non-viral transfector agent transfector poly-L-lysine. Methods: The labeling of mesenchymal stem cells was performedusing the superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/dextrancomplexed and not complexed to poly-L-lysine. Superparamagneticiron oxide nanoparticles/dextran was incubated with poly-L-lysine inan ultrasonic sonicator at 37 °C for 10 minutes for complex formationsuperparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysineby electrostatic interaction. Then, the mesenchymal stem cellswere incubated overnight with the complex superparamagnetic ironoxide nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine and superparamagneticiron oxide nanoparticles/dextran. After the incubation period themesenchymal stem cells were evaluated by internalization of thecomplex superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/dextran byPrussian Blue stain. Cellular viability of labeled mesenchymal stemcells was evaluated by cellular proliferation assay using 5, 6 -carboxyfluorescein-succinimidyl ester method and apoptosis detectionby Annexin V- Propidium Iodide assay. Results: mesenchymalstem cells labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/dextran without poly-L-lysine not internalized efficiently thesuperparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles due to its low presencedetected within cells. Mesenchymal stem cells labeled with thecomplex superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine efficiently internalized the superparamagnetic iron oxidenanoparticles due to greater presence in the cells interior. The viabilityand apoptosis assays demonstrated that the mesenchymal stemcells labeled and not labeled respectively with the superparamagneticiron oxide nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine continue to proliferateover seven days and the percentage of cells in early or late apoptosisis low compared to the percentage of live cells over the threedays. Conclusion: Our results showed that the use of poly-L-lysinecomplexed with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/dextranprovides better internalization of these superparamagnetic iron oxidenanoparticles in mesenchymal stem cells Thus, we demonstratedthat this type of labeling is not cytotoxic to the mesenchymal stemcells, since the viability and apoptosis assays showed that the cellsremain alive and proliferating. The efficiency of this type of labelingin mesenchymal stem cells can provide non-invasive methods formonitoring these cells in viv...|$|R
