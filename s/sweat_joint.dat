50|$|Brucella {{species are}} small, gram-negative, nonmotile, nonspore-forming, {{rod-shaped}} (coccobacilli) bacteria. They function as facultative intracellular parasites, causing chronic disease, which usually persists for life. Four species infect humans: B. abortus, B. canis, B. melitensis, and B. suis. B. abortus is less virulent than B. melitensis and {{is primarily a}} disease of cattle. B. canis affects dogs. B. melitensis is the most virulent and invasive species; it usually infects goats and occasionally sheep. B. suis is of intermediate virulence and chiefly infects pigs. Symptoms include profuse <b>sweating</b> and <b>joint</b> and muscle pain. Brucellosis has been recognized in animals and humans since the 20th century.|$|R
40|$|Background: Brucellosis is a {{zoonosis}} of veterinary, {{public health}} and economic significance in most developing countries. Human brucellosis is a severely debilitating disease that requires prolonged treatment {{with a combination of}} antibiotics. The disease can result in permanent and disabling sequel, and results in considerable medical expenses in addition to loss of income due to loss of working hours. A study was conducted in Northern Tanzania to determine the risk factors for transmission of brucellosis to humans in Tanzania. Methods: This was a matched case-control study. Any patient with a positive result by a competitive ELISA (c-ELISA) test for brucellosis, and presenting to selected hospitals with at least two clinical features suggestive of brucellosis such as headache, recurrent or continuous fever, <b>sweating,</b> <b>joint</b> pain, joint swelling, general body malaise or backache, was defined as a case. For every case in a district, a corresponding control was traced and matched by sex using multistage cluster sampling. Other criteria for inclusion as a control included a negative c-ELISA test result and that the matched individual would present to hospital if falls sick. Results: Multivariable analysis showed that brucellosis was associated with assisted parturition during abortion in cattle, sheep or goat. It was shown that individuals living in close proximity to other households had a higher risk of brucellosis.

40|$|Background: Brucellosis as a {{zoonotic}} {{infectious disease}} is endemic in Iran {{and due to}} the variation in clinical and laboratory findings, its diagnosis is often delayed. Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine clinical and laboratory aspects of the disease in Khuzestan. Patients and Methods: Medical records of 81 admitted patients with a diagnosis of brucellosis were reviewed. The study took place at Razi Hospital, a teaching hospital where infectious patients of Khuzestan are refereed. Clinical and laboratory findings of patients were reviewed. Diagnosis of brucellosis was made by measuring Brucella antibodies in the presence of clinical findings suggestive of brucellosis. Wright and mercapto-ethanol (2 ME) with titers more than 1 / 80 were considered positive. Results: The most common symptoms of the disease in this study were fever (85. 2 %), joint pain (72. 9 %), chills (42 %) and sweating (37 %). The most common signs in this study were arthritis (9. 9 %), tachycardia (6. 2 %) and tenderness in the lumbar spine (4. 9 %). Furthermore, the most common laboratory findings were normal white blood count (WBC) (94. 82 %), anemia (75. 3 %) and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (75. 3 %). Conclusions: In the studied region, when dealing with patients complaining of fever, chills, <b>sweating</b> and <b>joint</b> pain associated with normal WBC count and anemia, brucellosis should be placed on top of the differential diagnosis list and patients should be examined for Brucella serological evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Interstitial lung {{diseases}} are not infrequently complicated by development of malignancies and whilst most cases are carcinomas, rare cases of lymphoma have been reported,(1 2) these being diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and {{often associated with}} connective tissue disorders (CTDs). Reactive pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia (RPLH), typically {{in the form of}} lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) often arises in patients with CTDs and only rarely shows malignant transformation,(3) with many of the early putative cases of transformation to MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) lymphoma from LIP being lymphoma 'de novo'. (4) Herein we present a case of pulmonary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of MALT origin arising on a background RPLH with coexistent amyloidosis, confirmed by immunohistochemical and clonality studies. A 57 year old Caucasian female presented with chest pain and breathlessness at rest. She also described intermittent cough with small amounts of sputum, intermittent <b>sweats,</b> fatigue and <b>joint</b> pain in hands, feet, wrists, knees.

40|$|Resumen del póster presentado al Brucellosis 2014 International Research Conference, celebrado en Berlín (Alemania) del 9 al 12 de septiembre de 2014. Brucellosis is a {{zoonotic}} disease caused in humans by infection with diferent {{species of the}} genus Brucella spp. The most characteristic symptoms are an undulating fever, <b>sweating,</b> and <b>joint</b> and muscle pains, the classic brucellosis triad. One of the life-threatening complications of brucellosis is neurobrucellosis, that has been identified in up to one-third of pacients with cofirmed Brucella infection. The study of the mechanisms of infectious diseases in the brain has classically relied {{on the use of}} animal models and two-dimensional (2 D) cell cultures. However, 2 D monolayers lack of the structural complexity and the physiological relevance of the in vivo tissue preparations, since they are limited predictors of the infection process. In contrast, the use of animal models is time-consuming and depends on the availability of costly animal facilities. The introduction of the ex-vivo nervous system model (3 D organotypic slice cultures) has incorporated a fundamental experimental tool in this field of study. Key features of the ex vivo model include well-defined cellular architecture, the presence of axonal projections, and the preservation of the in vivo 3 D organization and long-term thickness of the preparation. Thus, the model mimics the morphological and functional features of the in vivo parental tissues. Brain slice cultures have been used to study infections of the CNS with several pathogens, and we have tested their ability to support Brucella infection and replicate some of the in vivo findings. Organotypic explants were obtained from newborn (7 - 10 -day old) Sprague Dawley rats, and infected with B. abortus 2308, and several avirulent mutant strains. The kinetics of the bacterial infection was determined, as well as expression of several markers associated with in vivo infection. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A 14 -year-old {{boy with}} a 5 -month history of {{progressive}} weight loss presented with a cough and sore throat for 2 days as well as 1 day of increased respiratory effort. On the morning of admission, the patient stayed home from school, due to worsening of his sore throat. Notably, the patient, who was always a slim child, had lost 8 to 10 pounds of weight {{over the course of}} 5 months. He once was an active baseball player, and now he no longer pos-sessed the energy to compete in athletics. Due to pro-gressive weight loss, the patient’s primary care physician referred the patient to a pediatric gastroenterologist, 1 month prior to our admission, who performed an initial workup, which was unremarkable. The patient denied fevers, vomiting, diarrhea, bone pain, night <b>sweats,</b> sick contacts, <b>joint</b> pain, rashes, illicit drugs, purging, or recent travel. Also of note, the patient was admitted to another hospital 2 months prior, where he presented with similar complaints of sore throat, cough, and respi-ratory distress. The patient was diagnosed with clinical pneumonia and was discharged with a 5 -day course of azithromycin. On our admission, the patient’s initial vital signs were the following: temperature 37. 6 °C, pulse 110, blood pressure 122 / 89, respiratory rate 40, oxygen satu-ration 95 % on room air, and weight 31 kg. On examina-tion, the patient was a cachectic appearing boy in moderate respiratory distress with suprasternal, inter-costal, and subcostal retractions. The patient had decreased breath sounds throughout, without wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. His cardiovascular exam was signifi-cant for tachycardia, though with a normal rhythm. His oropharynx was unremarkable. The remainder of the exam was within normal limits. Initial lab work revealed a white blood cell count of 11. 8, C-reactive protein 27. 2 (normal range = 0 - 5), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 9 (normal range = 0 - 15), and an otherwise normal com-prehensive metabolic panel. A chest X-ray and neck soft tissue film were both within normal limits.
