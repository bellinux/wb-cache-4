Bright has stated that, while too late for the planned release of Guitar Hero 5, they are looking towards future instrument controller interoperability, including use of the DJ Hero controller into gameplay for future Guitar Hero titles, or using drum controllers within DJ Hero.|$|E

He did not paint the hand; he merely inserted it with a software program.|$|E
500|$|When Usher {{felt that}} the album was completed, with forty {{recorded}} songs, he submitted the album to his record label, Arista. However, he and the company's then-president, L. A. Reid, who listened to the record, thought <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> in it. [...] "You know what, there's like {{one or two more}} records that we just gotta get." [...] Usher was displeased with the decision; he felt returning to the studio was the hardest part and needed to re-motivate himself. He went on recording a few more tracks with help from fellow Atlantian's Lil Jon and Ludacris. Eventually, the team was able to produce songs like [...] "Red Light" [...] and [...] "Yeah!". He also recorded songs with P. Diddy and The Neptunes during one of those sessions, but those songs were not released.|$|E

500|$|Brown {{had already}} {{completed}} recording sessions for Don't Be Cruel in Los Angeles, California, but felt <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> in the record. He said, [...] "I felt my album was lacking a strong, aggressive song and I thought, 'Where better than New York {{to come up}} with it'". He travelled to the city with producer Gene Griffin. [...] "My Prerogative" [...] was written and co-produced by Brown and Griffin. It was recorded at Axis Studios and mixed at Soundworks, in New York. The track was mastered at Future Disc Systems in Hollywood, California. During an interview with The Hour on March 17, 1989, Brown explained the theme behind the song, saying, [...] "A lot of things had been said about Bobby Brown, why was he doing this [...] It's my way of expressing to people it's your prerogative to do as you want, but make sure what you do is the right thing". A CD single of remixes by Joe T. Vannelli was released on October 13, 1995.|$|E
500|$|Carpenter {{had just}} made Dark Star but {{no one wanted to}} hire him as a director, so he assumed that he would make it in Hollywood as a screenwriter. The filmmaker went on to do other films with the {{intention}} of making Escape later. After the success of Halloween, Avco-Embassy signed him and producer Debra Hill to a two-picture deal. The first film from this contract was The Fog. Initially, the second film {{that he was going to}} make to finish the contract was The Philadelphia Experiment, but because of script-writing problems, Carpenter rejected it in favor of this project. However, Carpenter felt that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> and recalls, [...] "This was basically a straight action film. And at one point, I realized it really doesn't have this kind of crazy humor that people from New York would expect to see." [...] He brought in Nick Castle, a friend from his film school days at University of Southern California who played [...] "The Shape" [...] in Halloween. Castle invented the Cabbie character and came up with the film's ending.|$|E
500|$|After {{they viewed}} the final {{cut of the}} episode, Shiban and Spotnitz decided that they were [...] "far from the end". Feeling that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing,</b> the two decided to frame the happenings of the episode with two scenes {{featuring}} Scully in a church confessional. Vancouver producer J.P. Finn was chosen {{to play the role}} of the priest in the scene, due to his [...] "hushed delivery and map-of-Ireland features". Initially, Gillian Anderson was sent the script for the last-minute shot—which comprised two-and-a-half pages—well in advance. On the night before the reshoot, however, the crew sent her the further rewrites, which were much greater. Anderson refused to rush her performance, noting that, not only would it be difficult for her to memorize her lines, it would also undermine the emotion she was supposed to put into the scene. The crew ended up shooting a day later. Due to this, Finn never actually filmed with Anderson. In order to make up for the added scenes—a total of seven pages worth—the first cut of the episode had to be trimmed [...] "scene by scene and line by line".|$|E

500|$|Les Bowie {{provided}} the special effects: {{he had made}} his name perfecting an improved technique for matte painting, called the delineating matte, and formed a company with Vic Margutti that specialised in matte effects. Bowie provided a number of matte paintings to enhance the scale of certain key shots in the film, including the crashed rocket, the Westminster Abbey set and the shot of Quatermass walking away from the Abbey at the climax of the movie. Partly because of the concerns raised by the BBFC and partly on account of the low budget, Val Guest kept the creature largely off-screen for much of the film, feeling that audiences' imaginations would fill in the blanks more effectively than he and the special effects team could deliver on-screen. For the climactic scenes at Westminster Abbey, however, Bowie created a monster from tripe and rubber and photographed it against a model of the Abbey. Sparks and fireworks were used for the shots of the creature being electrocuted. Michael Carreras felt <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> when he viewed the first cut of this scene: he said, [...] "There was this great glob of something hanging about on the scaffolding. And they had put in the best music they could and put the best effects on it, but it meant nothing as far as I was concerned… absolutely nothing at all". An eye was added to the model of the monster and a human scream added to the soundtrack to give the creature some semblance of humanity in its final moments. Models were also used for the rocket blasting off in the final shot of the film.|$|E
500|$|The {{scenes in}} the Hendrixes' garage were filmed on a set; the set {{replicated}} the real garage of a house in Markham, Ontario which had been used for filming in the show's first season. The set was built [...] above the ground {{so that it could}} be excavated with a jackhammer on film. Bridgepoint Health Centre stood in as the clinic where Kira underwent bone marrow extraction, and was also used for exterior shots of the Dyad Institute. Scenes at Cosima's laboratory were filmed at the Don Jail, now an administrative facility connected to Bridgepoint. The montage of Rachel drinking martinis and watching home videos from her childhood was not originally included in the episode's script, nor was it filmed {{with the rest of the}} episode. According to Fawcett, when he and Manson viewed the final cut of the episode, they felt that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> from Rachel's subplot. Manson then scripted the short sequence and Fawcett filmed it over two days during the production of the next episode. Due to time constraints while filming the scene in which Helena tortures Henrik, the scene was shot with a handheld camera by the episode's director, TJ Scott, with Maslany and Outerbridge improvising the dialogue and use of props. The subsequent shot of the barn on fire was created by the visual effects company Intelligent Creatures. The title of the final two episodes, [...] "Things Which Have Never Yet Been Done" [...] and [...] "By Means Which Have Never Yet Been Tried", are taken from a Francis Bacon quotation in his philosophical work Novum Organum: [...] "It would be an unsound fancy and self-contradictory to expect that things which have never yet been done can be done except by means which have never yet been tried." ...|$|E
2500|$|Do As Infinity's fourteenth single, [...] "Shinjitsu no Uta", was {{released}} in October, and sparked {{the beginning of a}} new project for the band. [...] "Shinjitsu no Uta" [...] was also chosen to be the fifth ending theme for InuYasha. [...] "Shinjitsu no Uta" [...] became famous in China in July 2002 and was also translated into Mandarin. In the booklet of Do The A-side, Kawamura stated that [...] "Shinjitsu no Uta" [...] was actually written two years before the actual release. Dai said that he left it as a demo because he felt that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> in the song. Despite their success, Do As Infinity wanted to show their fans that they had not forgotten them. They advertised on their website for fans to send them short stories using the band's previous releases as themes and using the word shinjitsu (truth) somewhere in the story. Entitled Your Truth, these stories are now available in book form. The band closed out the year with another live tour, understandably titled Do As Infinity greatest year 02: All Standing, and the year-end release of their fourth album, True Song.|$|E

40|$|<b>Something</b> <b>is</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>is</b> an {{installation}} that incorporates drawing, a security camera, audio, appropriated objects and built sculptural elements using common construction materials and clay. This work {{is rooted in}} notions of failure and empathy. Drawings of organs float as if desperate to inhabit imaginary bodies, a security camera that resembles an examining tool of a medical practitioner fails to fix or function and walls fall short of completing a room. This room as a whole becomes a metaphor for a stage without actors. The thesis body of work that comprises <b>Something</b> <b>is</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>is</b> a meant to serve as what I call a dysfunctional affect machine that opens cross-sensory possibilities and induces empathetic feelings in the viewer. The aim of this machine is to pose questions rather than suggest answers to the contemporary predicament of being bodies in a post human era. This work is also meant to summarize a sort of contemporary anxiety, which I feel I participate in both {{as an artist and}} citizen of the World...|$|R
6000|$|There {{were about}} the village, within a few minutes' walk of the cottage, not fewer than half-a-dozen tree-pipits, each inhabiting a {{favourite}} spot where I could always count on finding and hearing him at almost any {{hour of the day}} from sunrise to sunset. Yet I cared not for these. To the one chosen bird I returned daily to spend the hot hours, lying in the shade and listening to his strain. Finally, I allowed two or three days to slip by, and when I revisited the old spot the secret charm had vanished. The bird was there, and rose and fell as formerly, pouring out his melody; but it was not the same: <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> from those last sweet, languishing notes. Perhaps in the interval there had been some disturbing accident in his little wild life, though I could hardly believe it, since his mate was still sitting about thirty yards from the tree on the five little mottled eggs in her nest. Or perhaps his midsummer's music had reached its highest point, and was now in its declension. And perhaps the fault was in me. The virtue that draws and holds us does not hold us always, nor very long; it departs from all things, and we wonder why. The loss is in ourselves, although we do not know it. Nature, the chosen mistress of our heart, does not change towards us, yet she is now, even to-day-- ...|$|E
