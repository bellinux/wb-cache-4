5|$|Scientific {{quantities}} {{are often}} expressed as logarithms of other quantities, using a logarithmic scale. For example, the decibel is {{a unit of}} measurement associated with logarithmic-scale quantities. It {{is based on the}} common logarithm of ratios—10 times the common logarithm of a power ratio or 20 times the common logarithm of a voltage ratio. It is used to quantify the loss of voltage levels in transmitting electrical signals, to describe power levels of sounds in acoustics, and the absorbance of light in the fields of spectrometry and optics. The <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> describing the amount of unwanted noise in relation to a (meaningful) signal is also measured in decibels. In a similar vein, the peak <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> is commonly used to assess the quality of sound and image compression methods using the logarithm.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{presents}} two spectrophotometric {{absorption bands}} peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760nm. Some remote sensing scientists have proposed using {{the measurement of}} the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform. This approach exploits {{the fact that in}} those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation's reflectance from its fluorescence, which is much weaker. The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.|$|E
5|$|In both {{recording}} and in live musical sound reinforcement, {{the key to}} noise minimisation is headroom. Headroom can be used either to reduce distortion and audio feedback by keeping signal levels low, or to reduce interference, both from outside sources and from the Johnson-Nyquist noise produced in the equipment, by keeping signal levels high. Most proprietary noise reducing technologies also introduce low levels of distortion. Noise minimisation therefore becomes a compromise between interference and distortion, both in {{recording and}} in live music, and between interference and feedback in live amplification. The work of Bart Kosko and Sanya Mitaim has also demonstrated that stochastic resonance {{can be used as}} a technique in noise minimisation and signal improvement in non-linear dynamical systems, as the addition of noise to a signal can improve the <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract-The {{degradation}} due {{to complete}} asynchronism (at the codeword and symbol levels) {{in the total}} capacity, maximum rate-sum, of white Gaussian multiple-access channels is investi-gated. It is shown that asynchronism reduces the total capacity of a K-user channel by at most a factor of K. Moreover, this bound is achieved, in asymptotically high <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios,</b> by the TDMA signalling strategy. When the signalling strategies are optimally designed to maximize the asynchronous total capacity under bandwidth constraints, we find that in a two-user channel 1) for a certain set of <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios</b> there is no degradation due to asynchronism, 2) for any bandwidth and <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios</b> the asynchronous total capacity is at least 88 % of the synchronous total capacity, and 3) asynchronism has a vanishing small effect on total capacity for both low and high <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{theory is}} {{developed}} {{on the assumption}} that early sensory processing aims at maximizing the information rate in the channels connecting the sensory system to more central parts of the brain, where it is assumed that these channels are noisy and have a limited dynamic range. Given a stimulus power spectrum, the theory enables the computation of filters accomplishing this maximizing of information. Resulting filters are band-pass or high-pass at high <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios,</b> and low-pass at low <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios.</b> In spatial vision this corresponds to lateral inhibition and pooling, respectively. The filters comply with Weber's law over a considerable range of <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|CW {{spectroscopy}} is inefficient {{in comparison}} with Fourier analysis techniques (see below) since it probes the NMR response at individual frequencies in succession. Since the NMR signal is intrinsically weak, the observed spectrum suffers from a poor <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio.</b> This can be mitigated by signal averaging i.e. adding the spectra from repeated measurements. While the NMR signal is constant between scans and so adds linearly, the random noise adds more slowly – proportional to the square root {{of the number of}} spectra (see random walk). Hence the overall <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> increases as the square-root of the number of spectra measured.|$|E

25|$|Most older {{hearing aids}} have only an {{omnidirectional}} microphone. An omnidirectional microphone amplifies sounds equally from all directions. In contrast, a directional microphone amplifies sounds from one direction more than sounds from other directions. This means that sounds originating {{from the direction}} the system is steered toward are amplified more than sounds coming from other directions. If the desired speech arrives {{from the direction of}} steering and the noise is from a different direction, then compared to an omnidirectional microphone, a directional microphone provides a better signal to noise ratio. Improving the <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> improves speech understanding in noise. Directional microphones {{have been found to be}} the second best method to improve the <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> (the best method was an FM system, which locates the microphone near the mouth of the desired talker).|$|E

The long-standing strong simplex conjecture, which postulates that the regular simplex signal set maximizes {{the probability of}} correct detection under an average-energy constraint, is disproven. A signal set is presented that performs better than the regular simplex signal set at low <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios</b> for all M 2 7. This leads to the result that, for all M 2 7, there is no signal set of M signals which is optimal at all <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios.</b> Furthermore, the optimal signal set at low <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios</b> is not an equal energy set for any iM 2 7. The regular simplex is shown to be the unique signal set which maximizes the mini-mum distance between signals. It follows that a signal set which maximizes the minimum distance is not necessarily optimum.

Abdominal recording of the fetal electrocardiogram may offer valuable additional information, but unfortunately is troubled by poor <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios</b> during certain parts of pregnancy. To increase the usability of abdominal fetal ECG recordings, an algorithm was developed that enhances fetal QRS complexes in these recordings and thereby provides a promising method for detecting the beat-to-beat fetal heart rate in recordings with poor <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios.</b> The method was evaluated on generated recordings with controlled <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios</b> and on actual recordings that were performed in clinical practice and were annotated by two independent experts.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} study relative contributions of speaking rate, temporal envelope, and temporal fine structure to clear speech perception. Experiment I used uniform time scaling to match the speaking rate between clear and conversational speech. Experiment II decreased the speaking rate in conversational speech without processing artifacts by increasing silent gaps between phonetic segments. Experiment III created "auditory chimeras" by mixing the temporal envelope of clear speech with the fine structure of conversational speech, and vice versa. Speech intelligibility in normal-hearing listeners was measured {{over a wide range}} of <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios</b> to derive speech reception thresholds (SRT). The results showed that processing artifacts in uniform time scaling, particularly time compression, reduced speech intelligibility. Inserting gaps in conversational speech improved the SRT by 1. 3 dB, but this improvement might be a result of increased short-term <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios</b> during level normalization. Data from auditory chimeras indicated that the temporal envelope cue contributed more to the clear speech advantage at high <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios,</b> whereas the temporal fine structure cue contributed more at low <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios.</b> Taken together, these results suggest that acoustic cues for the clear speech advantage are multiple and distributed.

These unwanted signals may originate from internal and external sources, both passive and active. The ability of the radar system to overcome these unwanted signals defines its <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> (SNR). SNR is defined as the ratio of the signal power to the noise power within the desired signal; it compares the level of a desired target signal to the level of background noise (atmospheric noise and noise generated within the receiver). The higher a system's SNR the better it is at discriminating actual targets from noise signals.|$|E

A scheme is devised whereby, through selective weighting of the rotational Raman lines, the effect of atmospheric temperature structure may be eliminated. The close spectral proximity of the elastic and Raman-scattered signals, combined {{with the fact that}} the Raman scattering is quite weak, produces special requirements for the spectroscopic and light-gathering components of a rotational Raman laser radar system. These requirements are investigated. A computation of typical <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratios</b> is made.

Empirically, and not by any formula, it was learned that the bass end of the audio spectrum below 100Hz could be boosted somewhat to override system hum and turntable rumble noises. Likewise at the treble end beginning at 1,000Hz, if audio frequencies were boosted by 16dB at 10,000Hz the delicate sibilant sounds of speech and high overtones of musical instruments could survive the noise level of cellulose acetate, lacquer–aluminum, and vinyl disc media.

25|$|Upon {{excitation}} of {{the sample}} with a radio frequency (60–1000MHz) pulse, a nuclear magnetic resonance response - a free induction decay (FID) - is obtained. It is a very weak signal, and requires sensitive radio receivers to pick up. A Fourier transform is carried out to extract the frequency-domain spectrum from the raw time-domain FID. A spectrum from a single FID has a low <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio,</b> but fortunately it improves readily with averaging of repeated acquisitions. Good 1H NMR spectra can be acquired with 16 repeats, which takes only minutes. However, for elements heavier than hydrogen, the relaxation time is rather long, e.g. around 8 seconds for 13C. Thus, acquisition of quantitative heavy-element spectra can be time-consuming, taking tens of minutes to hours.|$|E

The greater <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> in the LG cortical channel suggests that visual imagery in dreams may appear before full development of REM sleep, but this {{has not yet been}} confirmed.
