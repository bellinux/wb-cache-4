5|$|First, let me <b>say</b> <b>I</b> {{take full}} {{responsibility}} for my own actions {{and for those of}} my administration. As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities. As disappointed as I may be in some who served me, I'm still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior.|$|E

5|$|I {{understand}} {{there is a}} clerkship vacant in your office, and I beg {{to apply for the}} same. I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances. I have, however, been devoting all my time to Mathematics and developing the subject. I can <b>say</b> <b>I</b> am quite confident I can do justice to my work if I am appointed to the post. I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.|$|E

Their debut album is the fastest-selling debut album by a band in British chart history, and in 2013, Rolling Stone ranked it the 30th-greatest debut album of all time.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you <b>say</b> <b>I</b> can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

"'Exactly,' <b>says</b> <b>I.</b> 'Then why do {{the master}} minds of finance and philanthropy,' <b>says</b> <b>I,</b> 'charge us $2 {{to get into a}} race-track and let us into a library free?

5|$|In {{the wake}} of this attention, {{existing}} acts like Yeah Yeah Yeahs were able to sign to major record labels. A second wave of bands that managed to gain international recognition {{as a result of}} the movement included Interpol, the Killers, the Catheters, Mooney Suzuki and the Go in the US, and Franz Ferdinand, Bloc Party, Maxïmo Park, Editors, the Cribs, the Libertines, the Fratellis, Razorlight and Kaiser Chiefs in the UK. Arctic Monkeys were the most prominent act to owe their initial commercial success to the use of Internet social networking, with two No. 1 singles and Whatever People <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), which became the fastest-selling debut album in British chart history.|$|E
5|$|I should <b>say</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to}} write poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E

25|$|We'd see Basie in town, and I was {{impressed}} by Harry Edison and Buck Clayton, being a trumpet player. And I would <b>say</b> <b>I</b> {{was impressed}} by Dizzy Gillespie {{when he was with}} Cab Calloway. I {{was impressed by}} those three trumpet players of the people I saw in person... I thought Harry Edison and Dizzy Gillespie were the most unique of the trumpet players I heard.|$|E
25|$|It's true to {{say these}} {{programmes}} {{about climate change}} are different, in that previously I have made programmes about natural history, and now you could <b>say</b> <b>I</b> have an engaged stance. The first is {{about the fact that}} there is climate change and that it is human-induced. So I'm glad that the BBC wanted some clear statement of the evidence as to why these two things are the case.|$|E
25|$|I saw as my {{farewell}} to the major stage of cricket, {{and it would be}} dishonest to <b>say</b> <b>I</b> saw it sentimentally as an actor or an opera singer who wants to leave the stage with a memorable performance...I hoped to return to Australia for the fifth time, this time as England captain, and win the Ashes with the team I had built, nutured and encouraged. I was to learn, or course, that such romantic conceptions are not only born in the minds of fiction writers, but can die there as well.|$|E

Glover said: We {{not only have}} great respect for each other as athletes but we are great friends on and off the water.

25|$|On 19 November 2007, Spirit debuted on the UK Albums Chart {{at number}} one with first-week sales of 375,872 copies, {{making it the}} fastest selling debut album in the UK, beating Arctic Monkeys' Whatever People <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> Am, That's What I'm Not (2006) by 12,000 copies, until the release of Susan Boyle's debut album I Dreamed a Dream in November 2009, which sold 410,000 copies in its first week.

500|$|The band {{finished}} recording {{their debut}} album, Whatever People <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> Am, That's What I'm Not, at Chapel Studios in Lincolnshire in September 2005 with British record producer Jim Abbiss producing. Whatever People <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> Am, That's What I'm Not became the fastest selling debut album in UK chart history, selling 363,735 copies {{in the first}} week. This smashed the previous record of 306,631 copies held by Popstars by Hear'Say, and sold more copies on its first day alone – 118,501 – {{than the rest of}} the Top 20 albums combined. The cover sleeve of Whatever People <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> Am, That's What I'm Not, showing Chris McClure, a friend of the band smoking a cigarette, was criticised by the head of the NHS in Scotland for [...] "reinforcing the idea that smoking is OK". The image on the CD itself is a shot of an ashtray full of cigarettes. The band's product manager denied the accusation, and suggested the opposite – [...] "You can see from the image smoking is not doing him the world of good." ...|$|E
