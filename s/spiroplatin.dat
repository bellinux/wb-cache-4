40|$|A {{modified}} double-layer Hamburger and Salmon cloning assay {{was used}} to test cisplatin and its analogs (<b>spiroplatin,</b> carboplatin and iproplatin) on fresh tumor samples from 63 patients with a variety of non-hematological malignancies. Among them were 18 breast cancers, 17 ovarian cancers and 7 of unknown primaries. Half the patients received prior chemotherapy. Cisplatin regimens were given in 16 cases. When possible, cells were exposed for 1 h to each drug in concentrations of 0. 1 Μg/ml and 1. 0 Μg/ml for cisplatin and <b>spiroplatin,</b> 1. 0 Μg/ml and 10 Μg/ml for carboplatin and iproplatin. A ≧ 50 % cell kill with at least one drug was found in 20 samples including 8 ovarian cancers, 3 breast cancers and 1 unknown primary. A ≧ 70 % cell kill was seen in 2 samples with cisplatin, 3 with <b>spiroplatin</b> and carboplatin, and 6 with iproplatin. There was only partial cross-resistance between cisplatin and its analogs. Among 57 paired comparisons of cisplatin with <b>spiroplatin,</b> 2 showed drug sensitivity to cisplatin alone, 6 to <b>spiroplatin</b> alone, and 6 to both. The same sort of observation was made with carboplatin. The lack of cross-resistance between cisplatin and iproplatin was particularly striking: among 53 pairs, 6 were sensitive to cisplatin alone, 8 to iproplatin alone, and 2 to both. About 20 % of the samples that were resistant to cisplatin were sensitive to iproplatin. Our data show hints of activity in breast and ovarian cancers with all analogs and suggest that they will achieve clinical antitumor activity similar to that they will achieve clinical antitumor activity similar to that of cisplatin. The in vitro evidence of incomplete cross-resistance between cisplatin and its analogs should be investigated further. © 1990 Springer-Verlag. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Spiroplatin</b> was {{investigated}} in a multicenter phase II study, during which the drug was given over 4 h. 64 Patients with nine different solid tumors received 141 cycles of <b>spiroplatin</b> at a dose of 30 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks. Most important side effects included nausea, vomiting, myelosuppression, and renal toxicity. Four of 11 evaluable patients with prior cisplatin developed increases in serum creatinine (3 transient, 1 died of renal failure). Of 51 patients without prior cisplatin 2 had a transient increase in serum creatinine levels, and 2 showed persistent changes, in 1 of them leading to hemodialysis. Pre- and posthydration did not reduce drug-induced nephrotoxicity. Only 3 patients showed a response; 1 with renal cell carcinoma, 1 with ovarian carcinoma, and 1 with malignant melanoma. Based on the absence of striking antitumor activity and {{on the presence of}} severe unpredictable renal toxicity, the study was stopped prematurely...|$|E
