40|$|During viral infections, Toll-like receptor- 3 (TLR 3) {{stimulation}} initiates signaling {{to activate}} transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type- 1 interferons. Suppressor of IKK-ε (<b>SIKE)</b> interacts with two kinases in the signaling pathway, IKK-ε and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK 1), inhibiting the transcription of type I interferons. Recently, this laboratory discovered that <b>SIKE</b> blocks TBK 1 -mediated activation of type I interferons by {{acting as a}} high affinity, alternative substrate of TBK 1. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays suggested that the <b>SIKE</b> interaction network impinged upon the cytoskeleton and RNA transport. To characterize <b>SIKE’s</b> function within the antiviral response, <b>SIKE’s</b> role in RNA transport and cytoskeletal rearrangements was targeted for further study through immunofluorescence assays (IFAs), using traditional confocal microscopy. <b>SIKE</b> was found to colocalize with cytoskeleton components (β-actin and α-tubulin), endosomal and plasma membrane markers (Rab 11 a, LAMP- 1, and LC 3), and ribosomes (S 6). Additionally, IFA labeling for actin cytoskeleton-associated proteins revealed that <b>SIKE</b> colocalized with α-actinin, β-catenin, ezrin, and Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) in both myeloid and epithelial cells. These results {{were consistent with the}} hypothesis that <b>SIKE</b> functions in trafficking related to the anti-viral innate immune response. To further delineate the colocalization of α-actinin, α-tubulin, actin, and S 6 colocalization with <b>SIKE,</b> super-resolution microscopy, Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM), was used. In both cell lines, we found that <b>SIKE</b> colocalized with α-actinin, but did not consistently colocalize with the other markers. Therefore, <b>SIKE</b> localizes with actin, tubulin, and S 6 at distances greater than the 85 nm resolution achieved using SIM techniques. To address <b>SIKE</b> function following pathogen challenge, <b>SIKE</b> interactions were examined following two distinct stimuli. Polyinosinic acid: polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) was used as a mimic for viral dsRNA challenge. Following poly(I:C) stimulation, <b>SIKE</b> localization from 15 minutes to 24 hours showed little to no change. In addition to mediating a response to viral challenge, TBK 1, the kinase that phosphorylates <b>SIKE,</b> maintains Salmonella-containing vacuoles (SCVs) following S. enterica serovar typhimurium infection. Therefore, changes in <b>SIKE</b> colocalization during Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium infection were examined. Because TBK 1 is integral to maintenance of the Salmonella containing vacuole, the hypothesis was that <b>SIKE</b> may also contribute to the host cell response to this infection. <b>SIKE</b> colocalization with various markers for Salmonella-containing vacuoles changes during the time course of Salmonella infection (15 minutes to 18 hours) in a manner that suggested <b>SIKE</b> {{may play a role in}} signaling and trafficking related to the host cell’s response to this infection. These studies support a <b>SIKE</b> and α-actinin interaction that is consistent with <b>SIKE</b> functioning in the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, <b>SIKE’s</b> altered colocalization following Salmonella challenge suggest this protein may contribute to cytoskeletal structures that maintain these pathogen-containing vacuoles...|$|R

40|$|Viral {{infection}} or TLR 3 engagement causes {{activation of the}} transcription factors IRF- 3 and NF-κB, which collaborate to induce transcription of type I IFN genes. IKKɛ and TBK 1 are two IKK-related kinases critically involved in virus- and TLR 3 -triggered activation of IRF- 3. We identified a protein termed <b>SIKE</b> (for Suppressor of IKKɛ) that interacts with IKKɛ and TBK 1. <b>SIKE</b> is associated with TBK 1 under physiological condition and dissociated from TBK 1 upon viral {{infection or}} TLR 3 stimulation. Overexpression of <b>SIKE</b> disrupted the interactions of IKKɛ or TBK 1 with TRIF, RIG-I and IRF- 3, components in virus- and TLR 3 -triggered IRF- 3 activation pathways, but did not disrupt the interactions of TRIF with TRAF 6 and RIP, components in TLR 3 -triggered NF-κB activation pathway. Consistently, overexpression of <b>SIKE</b> inhibited virus- and TLR 3 -triggered interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE) but not NF-κB activation. Knockdown of <b>SIKE</b> potentiated virus- and TLR 3 -triggered ISRE but not NF-κB activation. Moreover, overexpression of <b>SIKE</b> inhibited IKKɛ- and TBK 1 -mediated antiviral response. These findings suggest that <b>SIKE</b> is a physiological suppressor of IKKɛ and TBK 1 and plays an inhibitory role in virus- and TLR 3 -triggered IRF- 3 but not NF-κB activation pathways...|$|R

For each scheme, size exclusion chromatography and SDS-PAGE/Coomassie/silver stain were used to assess purity. Crystallization trials for samples from each purification scheme were completed. In addition to crystallization trials, hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) was investigated, accompanied with pepsin digests, in order to further characterize the dynamic structure of <b>SIKE...</b>|$|R

40|$|Innate {{immunity}} {{provides the}} first line of defense against invading pathogen by recognizing and mounting a response to the pathogenic challenge. Among the cellular mechanisms of the innate immune response, Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR 3) recognizes viral dsRNA and signals subsequent production of type-I interferon. The TLR 3 :interferon signaling cascades contains a kinase complex composed of two kinases and a scaffold protein, NAK-associated protein 1 (NAP 1). The role of NAP 1 in modulating kinase activation or regulation is unknown. A key inhibitory protein identified in the TLR 3 :interferon pathway, silencer of inhibitor of κBα kinase ε (<b>SIKE),</b> blocks the activity of this kinase complex through an unknown mechanism. The long term goal of this project is to define how protein:protein interactions modulate signal transduction in this pathway as mediated by host in the context of an immune response, pathogen as it attempts to subvert the host immune system and in disease states such as cancer and obesity. Objectives for this thesis were to produce recombinant <b>SIKE</b> and NAP 1 material that could be used to elucidate the self-association pattern and hetero-interactions mediated by these components within the pathway. <b>SIKE</b> full-length, <b>SIKE</b> 72 (residues 72 - 207), NAP 270 (residues 1 - 270) and NAP 255 (residues 1 - 255) expression constructs were completed and recombinant protein produced using either a bacterial or baculovirus/insect cell expression system. Self-association was characterized by size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation. Hetero-interactions were explored via co-precipitation assays of recombinant proteins. <b>SIKE</b> 72 formed a primarily dimeric structure whereas NAP 255 forms a single species that appears to be monomeric at this stage of analysis. Hetero-interactions form between the kinase TBK- 1 and NAP 255 and also TBK- 1 and <b>SIKE</b> 72. TBK- 1 shows a higher preference for binding NAP 255 in the prescence of both NAP 255 and <b>SIKE</b> 72. This work provides methodology to produce recombinant material for two components of the TLR 3 :interferon pathway and their initial biochemical characterization for both self-association and hetero-interactions...|$|R
