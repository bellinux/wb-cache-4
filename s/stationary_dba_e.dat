40|$|OBJETIVO: analisar os níveis de ruídos emitidos por brinquedos nacionalmente comercializados, utilizados por crianças de 1 a 5 anos; comparar os valores entre os brinquedos com e sem selo do Inmetro (Instituto Nacional de Metrologia, Normalização e Qualidade Industrial) e analisar o espectro acústico dos brinquedos, com o intuito de identificar a área da cóclea que pode ser mais afetada por esses ruídos. MÉTODO: as medições foram {{realizadas}} em 20 brinquedos sonoros (10 com o selo do Inmetro e 10 sem o selo) com o uso do decibelímetro digital em sala acusticamente tratada, e a análise dos sons emitidos pelos brinquedos foi realizada por meio do programa Praat. RESULTADOS: a intensidade do ruído dos brinquedos com o selo do Inmetro posicionados a 2, 5 cm do equipamento variou de 61, 50 a 91, 55 <b>dB(A)</b> <b>e</b> 69, 75 a 95, 05 dB(C) e a referente à distância de 25 cm variou entre 58, 30 a 79, 85 <b>dB(A)</b> <b>e</b> 62, 50 a 83, 65 dB(C). A intensidade do ruído dos brinquedos sem o selo do Inmetro a 2, 5 cm variou entre 67, 45 a 94, 30 <b>dB(A)</b> <b>e</b> 65, 4 a 99, 50 dB(C) e na distância de 25 cm registrou desde 61, 30 a 87, 45 <b>dB(A)</b> <b>e</b> 63, 75 a 97, 60 dB(C), portanto os achados demonstraram que existem brinquedos ruidosos que ultrapassam os valores recomendados pela legislação vigente em ambos os grupos, com e sem selo do Inmetro. CONCLUSÃO: os brinquedos sem o selo do Inmetro apresentaram valores de intensidade significantemente maior em relação ao outro grupo, oferecendo maior risco à saúde auditiva das crianças. PURPOSE: {{to analyze}} the levels of noise emitted by nationally-sold toys for use by children from 1 to 5 year old; to compare the values among the toys with and without the seal of Inmetro (National Institute of Metrology, Standardization and Industrial Quality) and {{to analyze the}} sound spectrum of toys, {{in order to identify}} the area of the cochlea that may be more affected by these noises. METHOD: measurements were performed on 20 sound toys (10 with the seal of the Inmetro and 10 without the seal) with the use of digital sound level meter in an acoustically treated room, and the sound analysis was performed using the Praat program. RESULTS: toys placed at 2. 5 cm from the equipment with the seal of the Inmetro had an intensity ranging from 61. 50 to 91. 55 dB (A) and from 69. 75 to 95. 05 dB (C), positioned at 25 cm ranged from 58. 3 to 79. 85 dB (A) and from 62. 50 to 83. 65 dB (C). The results of the toys without warranty stamps placed at 2. 5 cm ranged from 67. 45 to 94. 30 dB (A) and 65. 4 to 99. 50 dB (C) and the distance of 25 cm recorded from 61. 30 to 87. 45 dB (A) and 63. 75 to 97. 60 dB (C), so that the findings demonstrated that there are noisy toys that go beyond the values recommended by the current legislation in both groups, with and without warranty stamps. CONCLUSION: the toys without the seal of Inmetro showed intensities values significantly higher than the other group, offering more risk to the children&# 8217;s hearing health...|$|R

O grau de resistência de cada linhagem varia {{conforme}} o tipo da cepa. Todas as linhagens mostraram alta susceptibilidade à infecção pela cepa peruana; em relação às cepas 21 SF e colombiana, os padrões de resistência de cada linhagem variam de acordo com a cepa, formando um espectro, que difere entre as duas cepas citadas, sendo em geral mais reistentes as linhagens <b>DBA</b> <b>e</b> B- 10 e menos resistentes as linhagens AKR e A/J. Os animais de todas as linhagens infectados com quaisquer das cepas apresentaram alterações das imunoglobulinas com diminuição precoce da IgG 1 e elevação de IgG 2 a' IgG 2 b e IgM. Houve uma correlação entre o aumento de IgG 2 a e o grau de reação inflamatória. O infiltrado inflamatório variou de acordo com as linhagens de camundongo, sendo moderado e mononuclear nas mais susceptíveis e com predomínio de polimorfonucleares nas mais resistentes. Os resultados sugerem que as características do parasito são o fator determinante do padrão básico da infecção pelo T. cruzi The {{behavior of}} three strains o/Trypanosoma cruzi, classijied {{according to their}} morphobiological, histopathological and isoenzymic characters, as Typel (Peruvian strain), Type II (21 SF strain) and TypelII (Colombian strain), was evaluated by the infection of six inbred strains of mice: A/J, AKR, Balb/c C 3 H, C 57 BL/ 10 and DBA. It was observed that the three strains of T. cruzi maintained their basic characteristic in respect to parasitemia, survival time, histopathological lesions and tissue tropism in all the mouse strains. The Peruvian strain (Type I) resulted in a high mortality in all the animals; {{on the other hand}} the infection with the 21 SF (Type II) and Colombian /Type III) strains displayed a variable pattem of mortality determining a singular spectrum of resistance to eachparasite strain. Early decrease of IgG 1 and Progressive rise of IgG 2 a> IgG 2 b and IgM leveis, was observed, independently of the mouse or the parasite strain. There was a correlation between increased IgG 2 a leveis and intensity of the inflammatory process. Exudative lesions with polymorphonuclear neutrophils occurred in the resistant mice while a scarce infiltrate with predominance of mononuclear cells was observed in the more suceptible mouse strain. Our results suggest that the characteristics of T. cruzi strains are of the upmost importance {{in the course of the}} infection, but the host strain also plays a very important role in the process...|$|R

This {{research was}} carried out with in growing and finishing facilities of swine housing with the objective to evaluate and compare the noise level emitted by the animals mainly during feeding and noise level from other sources, and estimate the occupational risk exposition of workers. The evaluation was made using noise level equipment and measurement as indicated in NR- 15 norm located at 1. 50 m of height, corresponding to the mean height of the worker's ear. Four swine housings were evaluated. The statistical analysis was done using fatorial design and mean test. The results indicated significant differences at 1 % probability level among the four housings. The mean noise level was 65 dB(A) and 70 dB(A) for growing and finished housing respectively, within the limits allowed in the NR 15 norm (85 dB(A)) for a daily working of 8 h. Considering the peak noise level observed during feeding and other task schedule mainly finishing swine housing ear protection is recommended.

40|$|A denuder/filter system {{constructed}} for solvent-free personal exposure measurements was evaluated {{for separation of}} vapour and particulate 4, 4 '-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (4, 4 '-MDI) generated from heated PUR-foam. The two different phases were collected in the denuder and on the filter, respectively, by chemosorption on a polydimethylsiloxane (SE- 30) -dibutylamine (<b>DBA)</b> <b>stationary</b> phase. Both repeatability and the total mass concentration of 4, 4 '-MDI were similar to that obtained from the reference method, in this case an impinger/filter system. The penetration of particles through the denuder at 300 ml min(- 1) was nearly 100 % in the particle size range 25 to 700 nm, which fits well with the Gormley-Kennedy equation. Denuder/filter sampling of the 4, 4 '-MDI aerosol at 500 ml min(- 1) yielded a phase distribution that was {{in accordance with the}} results from the reference method.

40|$|Anthropogenic noise has {{increased}} dramatically worldwide which has negatively impacted wildlife. The effect of noise on acoustically specialized predators has received limited attention. Here I demonstrate that noise generated by a natural gas compressor station degrades {{the ability of the}} northern saw-whet owl (Aegolius acadius) to detect and capture prey in the absence of light. The saw-whet owl is considered an acoustic specialist because it exhibits a high degree of ear asymmetry, an adaptation for precise three-dimensional sound localization in birds. I presented 31 wild-caught saw-whet owls with mice (Mus musculus) inside a flight tent under acoustic conditions ranging from control 29 dB(A) to 73 dB(A). By varying the noise treatments in intensity and spectral composition I recreated acoustic conditions corresponding with distances between 50 - 800 m from an active compressor station. I found that saw-whet owls were able to capture prey using hearing alone but were not able to capture mice at or above 61 <b>dB(A),</b> i. <b>e.,</b> noise intensities found within 200 m of a compressor station. In order to assess the manner by which noise affected owl hunting, I postulated multiple hypotheses. First, the noise levels used in this experiment might affect owl hunting by the same amount, which I labeled the threshold hypothesis. Secondly, noise impacts might increase with increasing noise, which I labeled the dose-response hypothesis. I compared these hypotheses using a model selection framework. Hunting deficits increased with increasing noise lending support to the dose-response hypothesis. Each decibel increase in noise between 29 - 73 dB(A) resulted in an 11 % decrease in the odds of the owl orienting toward its prey during a trial, a 7 % decrease in the odds of a strike, and an 8 % decrease in the odds of successfully capturing the mouse. These results suggest that unmitigated natural gas compressor station noise has the potential to decrease habitat suitability for acoustically specialized owls...|$|R
40|$|During three {{journeys}} of 15 h in a lorry and {{two sets}} of experiments in a trailer, {{the relative importance of}} ambient noise and vehicular motion were assessed by measurements of salivary cortisol concentration, heart rate and behaviour. Mean sound levels in the lorry were approximately 96 dbA with occasional episodes at 103 dbA. Vehicular motion was assessed in terms of numbers and magnitude of acceleration events registered by a triaxial accelerometer. The three lorry journeys showed, respectively, that heart rate was correlated with vehicular motion when sheep were loosely stocked (0 • 41 m 2 per sheep) but not when they were tightly stocked (0 • 28 m 2 per sheep); that heart rate sometimes tended to increase when ambient sound was greater and that the effect of sound was not as consistent as that of vehicular motion. In the first trailer experiment, salivary cortisol response was the same whether sheep confined in a quiet <b>stationary</b> trailer (60 <b>dbA)</b> were or were not exposed to extra noise (90 dbA) while heart rate was higher in the former condition. In the second trailer experiment when the trailer was being towed on public roads with or without extra noise (92 • 3 and 100 • 5 dbA respectively), heart rate and salivary cortisol concentration were both elevated compared with control sheep in a pen but the extra noise had no consistent effect. The sheep showed no orientation away from the noise source, nor was there any difference in their expression of a behaviour (standing with the head below the level of the shoulders) which could indicate discomfort. Hence vehicular motion can result in poor welfare in sheep, especially at loose stocking density but ambient noise was not found to have a consistent effect...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research described in this thesis was to demonstrate the role of gene-environment interactions {{in the emergence of}} individual differences in cocaine use. For this purpose we used two inbred mouse strains, the C 57 Bl/ 6 (C 57) and DBA/ 2 (DBA), which are known to differ in drug-intake and to be differentially sensitive to several stressors. We studied the impact of early life experiences (long-term influence) as well as a later life psychosocial stressor (short-term influence) on adult drug intake behavior in these two mouse strains. To study the impact of the early life environment, we manipulated the maternal environment of the mice by fostering them with non-related mother strains showing either high or low pup-oriented behaviour. The late life experience consisted of a short-lasting period of group housing in adulthood. Cocaine self-administration in mice with a C 57 background was not affected by either changes in postnatal maternal environment or a short group housing experience in adulthood, while these same experiences did affect mice with a DBA background. As a first step towards the biological mechanisms underlying this gene-environment interaction we found that vasopressin was differentially regulated in the extended amygdala of the <b>DBA</b> mice.

Recent studies in this laboratory have shown that acenaphthylene induces Cypla 2 gene expression in mice and this study further investigates this induction response. Studies with six genetically-inbred strains of mice have shown that the activity of acenaphthylene (300 mg/kg) as an inducer of CYPlA 2 -dependent methoxyresorufin 0 -demethylase (MROD) was age-and strain-dependent. The results showed that DBA mice, compared to the C 57 BL/ 6, C 3 H, CBA, A/j and SJL strains were most responsive to induction after a single dose of acenaphthylene (300 mg/kg). Hepatic MROD activity in acenaphthylene-treated DBA mice was induced 22 -and 4 -fold in males and females respectively. In contrast, a < 2 to 4 -fold induction of ethoxyresorufin 0 -deethylase (EROD) activity was observed in both sexes. The other inbred strains had higher basal rates of hepatic MROD activity than the <b>DBA</b> strain, (i. <b>e.</b> C 3 H, C 57 BL/ 6, CBA, A/j and SJL). Differences in induction of MROD activity by acenaphthylene among the strains was primarily due to allelic variation (responsive or non responsive) at the aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) locus. Current studies are focused on further characterizing the strain-specific effects of acenaphthylene and related compounds and the molecular regulation of hepatic CYPlA 2 gene expression in male and female DBA mice and other rodent species...|$|R
40|$|This report {{gives the}} results of the EU financed study WINDFARMpertception on how {{residents}} perceive a wind farm in their living environment as far as sound and sight are concerned. The study includes a postal survey among Dutch residents (n = 725, response rate: 37 %) and an assessment of their aural and visual exposure due to wind farms in their vicinity. Respondents in the survey and calculated exposures The study group was selected from all residents in the Netherlands within 2. 5 km from a wind turbine. As the study aimed to study modern wind farms, wind turbines were selected with an electric capacity of 500 kW or more and one or more turbines within 500 m from the first. Excluded were wind turbines that were erected or replaced in the year preceding the survey. Residents lived in the countryside with or without a busy road close to the turbine(s), or in built-up areas (villages, towns). Excluded were residents in mixed and industrial areas. The sound level at the residents’ dwellings was calculated according to the international ISO standard for sound propagation, the almost identical Dutch legal model and a simple (non spectral) calculation model. The indicative sound level used was the sound level when the wind turbines operate at 8 m/s in daytime -that is: at high, but not maximum power. The size of the turbines was calculated as the viewing angle between the lowest and highest part of the biggest turbine, and also as the fraction of space above the horizon occupied by all wind turbines, both from the perspective of residents’ dwellings. Respondents were exposed to levels of wind turbine sound between 24 and 54 dBA and wind turbines at distances from 17 m to 2. 1 km. The (angular) height of the biggest wind turbine ranged from 2 degrees to 79 degrees, with an average value of 10 degrees (the height of a CD box, looking at the front at arm’s length). The wind turbines occupied on average 2 % of the space above the horizon. Attitude and economic involvement of respondents Almost all respondents (92 %) were satisfied with their living environment, though many reported changes for the better and changes for the worst. One in two respondents were (very) positive towards wind turbines in general, but only one in five were (very) positive towards their impact on the landscape scenery. Fourteen percent of the repondents had economic benefits from wind turbines by owning them or having shares in wind turbines or otherwise. They usually lived closer to the wind turbines, were higher educated, less old and hence healthier compared to the other respondents, and they relatively often worked at home. Respondents with economical benefits were less negative to wind turbines in general and their influence on the landscape scenery. Response to wind turbine sound The percentage of respondents noticing the sound of wind turbines increased with increasing sound level, ranging from 25 % at low sound levels (less than 30 dBA) to 80 % and more at higher sound levels (above 35 dBA). Percentages were the same for those who had benefits and the other respondents. The percentage of respondents that were annoyed by the sound also increased with sound level up to 40 to 45 dBA and then decreased. Respondents with economic benefits reported almost no annoyance. This in part explains the decrease in annoyance at high sound levels: above 45 <b>dBA,</b> i. <b>e.</b> close to wind turbines, the majority of respondents have economical benefits. The percentage of respondents without economic benefits that were rather or very annoyed when outdoors increased from 2 % at low levels of wind turbine sound (less than 30 dBA) up to 25 % at levels of 40 to 45 dBA. In general respondents perceived wind turbines as being louder in wind blowing from the turbine to their dwelling (and less loud the other way round), in stronger wind and at night. The majority (75 %) of respondents that could hear wind turbines think that swishing or lashing is a correct characterization of the sound. The second most typical characterization was rustling (for 25 % of the respondents). Other characterizations were chosen by less than 10 % of the respondents. Respondents {{were more likely to be}} annoyed by sound from wind turbines when they noted changes for the worse in their living environment and when they had a more negative view on wind turbines in general or their impact on the landscape scenery. Health effects There is no indication that the sound from wind turbines had an effect on respondents’ health, except for the interruption of sleep. At high levels of wind turbine sound (more than 45 dBA) interruption of sleep was more likely than at low levels. Higher levels of background sound from road traffic also increased the odds for interrupted sleep. Annoyance from wind turbine sound was related to difficulties with falling asleep and to higher stress scores. From this study it cannot be concluded whether these health effects are caused by annoyance or vice versa or whether both are related to another factor. Response to other aspects of wind turbines Respondents were also annoyed by wind turbines in other ways than by sound: between 4 % and 13 % were rather or very annoyed by vibrations or the movement of rotor blades or their shadows in- or outdoors. One out of three respondents could not see a wind turbine from their dwelling, especially when living in a built-up area or further away from the turbines. The visibility of wind turbines strongly affected the probability of being annoyed by their sound: when turbines were visible, respondents were far more likely to be annoyed. An unexpected result was that respondents living in a rural area with a main road within 500 m from the wind turbine(s) were less annoyed than respondents living in a built-up area, though the background sound levels from road traffic are on average the same in both area types and one would expect that wind turbines are more readily visible in a rural area. Recommendations In this survey sound was the most annoying aspect of wind turbines. From this and previous studies it appears that sound from wind turbines is relatively annoying: at the same sound level it causes more annoyance than sound from air or road traffic. A swishing character is observed by three out of four respondents that can hear the sound and could be one of the factors explaining the annoyance. Sound is therefore an important and negative feature of wind farms and we recommend that, in the planning of wind farms, the negative impact of the sound and sound reduction should be given more attention. Nevertheless, people that have economical benefits from wind turbines are much less or not at all annoyed, even though they often live closer to wind farms and are exposed to higher sound levels. This lack of annoyance may be the result of several factors: e. g. the ‘benefitters’ have a more positive view on wind farms, they have an actual benefit and they have a measure of control on the turbines. These characteristics may show the way to more acceptance and less annoyance with other residents: residents may be given some benefits and a sense of control too. Discussion of the different views on the landscape, instead of opposition to other views, may help in reaching consensus. Visibility of wind turbines enhances their potential to cause noise annoyance. When wind turbines are invisible, they cause less annoyance. Perhaps less visibility can also be the result of reducing the visual contrast between turbines and landscape. The possibilities to do this will depend on the landscape type. The capability of busy road traffic to mask the sound of wind turbines is apparently not straightforward: a higher level of background sound from road traffic indeed reduces the probability of noticing the sound of wind turbines, but it does not have an effect on annoyance from the wind turbines. This may be due to differences between both sounds in pitch, in character (swishing) and in diurnal variation. This issue needs further investigation. ...|$|R
