In general, econometrics differs from other branches of <b>statistics</b> <b>in</b> <b>focusing</b> on theoretical models, whose parameters are estimated using regression analysis. Spatial econometrics is a refinement of this, where either the theoretical model involves interactions between different entities, or the data observations are not truly independent.

In our study that enters {{within the framework}} of integrable turbulence, we specifically focus on optical fiber systems accurately described by the integrable one-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equation. We consider random complex fields having a gaussian statistics and an infinite extension at initial stage. We use numerical simulations with periodic boundary conditions and optical fiber experiments to investigate spectral and statistical changes experienced by nonlinear waves <b>in</b> <b>focusing</b> and <b>in</b> defocusing propagation regimes. As a result of nonlinear propagation, the power spectrum of the random wave broadens and takes exponential wings both <b>in</b> <b>focusing</b> and <b>in</b> defocusing regimes. Heavy-tailed deviations from gaussian <b>statistics</b> are observed <b>in</b> <b>focusing</b> regime while low-tailed deviations from gaussian <b>statistics</b> are observed <b>in</b> defocusing regime. After some transient evolution, the wave system is found to exhibit a statistically stationary state in which neither the probability density function of the wave field nor the spectrum change with the evolution variable.

By chosing the following research theme: "Tourism and development in the euroregional context" I felt the need to find out more answers regarding the afore mentioned problem. In consequence I started to consult the statistics recorded in our country concerning the number of overnight stays registered in Romania during the period June-August 2009 / 2010, in order to check whether an error has sneaked in. The research methodology employed consisted {{in the use of the}} insse. ro site, in order to gather representative data for the period June-September 2009 / 2010, regarding the number of nights spent by foreign and Romanian tourists in Romania. For this study to be even more representative I have established Romania's main touristic areas preferred by Romanian and foreign tourists. Following the data collected, unfortunately, it has been confirmed the situation presented by Eurostat in the table at the beginning of paper on the number of overnight stays registered in Romania. According to the data presented in this table, Romania ranks last in the EU, registering in 2010 a rate of only 15 % of total nights spent by non-residents in our country. I also tried to find answer to the following questions: Which are Romanians' favorite touristic areas? In which tourist area of Romania has been recorded the highest number of overnight stays of foreign tourists? Why the number of nights spent by foreigners in Romania is so small? Which are the main shortcomings of Romanian tourism? For the last two questions I tried to answer with the help of some experts in tourism, who consider that although there presented inadequacies exist for more than 10 to 15 years, the steps taken for their improvement are achieved with the slowness.

With carefully chosen rescaling constants, the approximation to the rescaled largest eigenvalue distribution by the limit attains accuracy of order O((n,p) ^- 2 / 3).

40|$|How {{does the}} brain {{represent}} our visual environment? Research has revealed brain areas that respond to specific {{information such as}} faces and objects, but how a representation of an entire visual scene is formed is still unclear. This thesis explores the idea that scene statistics {{play an important role}} in the formation of neural representations of real-world scenes. Scene statistics are statistical regularities resulting from the physical laws that govern our environment. The main hypothesis is that the brain uses these statistical regularities to rapidly categorize scenes. To test this hypothesis, we used an interdisciplinary approach, integrating methods from psychology, neuroscience and informatics (computer vision). In five chapters, we describe a total of 10 experiments in which we tested computational models of scene statistics against human behavioral and brain data obtained with electro-encephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our results show that the visual system exhibits strong sensitivity to scene <b>statistics.</b> <b>Focusing</b> <b>in</b> particular on the temporal dynamics of this neural sensitivity, we examined in depth how scene statistics shape neural representations. We demonstrate a potential role for scene <b>statistics</b> <b>in</b> perceived similarity of naturalistic textures, scene gist perception and object recognition. Overall, the results suggest that visual cortex might compute scene <b>statistics</b> <b>in</b> order to estimate the degree of coherence, i. e. the amount of organized structure vs. chaos present in the visual input, and use this information for rapid scene categorization, or to dynamically adjust its processing of other visual information, such as objects...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. —Evolutionary {{biologists}} have introduced numerous statistical approaches to explore nonvertical evolution, such as horizontal gene transfer, recombination, and genomic reassortment, through collections of Markov-dependent gene trees. These tree collections allow for inference of nonvertical evolution, but only indirectly, making findings {{difficult to interpret}} and models difficult to generalize. An alternative approach to explore nonvertical evolution relies on phylogenetic net-works. These networks provide a framework to model nonvertical evolution but leave unanswered questions such as the statistical significance of specific nonvertical events. In this paper, we begin to correct the shortcomings of both approaches by introducing the “stochastic model for reassortment and transfer events ” (SMARTIE) drawing upon ancestral recombi-nation graphs (ARGs). ARGs are directed graphs that allow for formal probabilistic inference on vertical speciation events and nonvertical evolutionary events. We apply SMARTIE to phylogenetic data. Because of this, we can typically infer a single most probable ARG, avoiding coarse population dynamic summary <b>statistics.</b> <b>In</b> addition, a <b>focus</b> on phylogenetic data suggests novel probability distributions on ARGs. To make inference with our model, we develop a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler to approximate the posterior distribution of SMARTIE. Using the BEAST phylogeneti...|$|R

These contrasts are first and foremost within the countries themselves, because extremes of wealth and poverty are present in their social and economic fabric.
