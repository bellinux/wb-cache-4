40|$|LFSR’s {{are widely}} used in the BIST environment. In [1] a {{multiphase}} technique is proposed to reduce the data transitions (DTs) in both the LFSR and the circuit under test. However, its multiphase clock generator is implemented by a conventional Johnson counter with a complex control logic, which requires considerable area overhead and power dissipation.

50|$|Such {{deaths were}} not {{uncommon}} for children in the United States before {{the passage of the}} Refrigerator Safety Act in 1956. Children would occasionally play in abandoned refrigerators and become trapped. The first reactions to the deaths were to ask people not to abandon refrigerators and to detach the doors of unused refrigerators. At least one state, Oklahoma, enacted legislation making the abandonment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> refrigerator with <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> in <b>a</b> location where a child might find it a felony. In the mid- to late 1950s troops of people would sometimes search out abandoned refrigerators, detaching the doors and smashing the locks. However, these efforts were not entirely effective, and children were still dying inside of refrigerators that had not been found and dismantled. The continued occurrence of refrigerator deaths led to a law that required a change in the way refrigerator doors stay shut. The act applied to all refrigerators manufactured in the United States after October 31, 1958, and is largely responsible for the adoption of the magnetic mechanism that is used today instead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>latch.</b>|$|R

40|$|Fixed-phase {{retiming}} is {{a technology}} independent optimization technique {{for reducing the}} power dissipation of digital circuits without sacrificing their performance [1].

The capacitance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> is smaller than the input capacitance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> combinational gate, hence the power dissipation during the opaque phase of the latch is reduced. This objective is achieved by transforming a given edge-triggered circuit into a two-phase level-clocked circuit. the transform is done by replacing each edgetriggered flip-flop by two back-to-back level-clocked latches.

40|$|Abstract Background While {{biological}} systems {{have often been}} compared with digital systems, they differ by the strong effect of crosstalk between signals due to diffusivity in the medium, reaction kinetics and geometry. Memory elements have allowed the creation of autonomous digital systems and although {{biological systems}} have similar properties of autonomy, equivalent memory mechanisms remain elusive. Any such equivalent memory system, however, must silence the effect of crosstalk to maintain memory fidelity. Results Here, we present <b>a</b> system <b>of</b> enzymatic reactions that behaves like <b>an</b> RS <b>latch</b> (<b>a</b> simple memory element in digital systems). Using both a stochastic molecular simulator and ordinary differential equation simulator, we showed that crosstalk between two latches operating in the same spatial localization disrupts the memory fidelity of both latches. Crosstalk was reduced or silenced when simple reaction loops were replaced with multiple step or cascading reactions, showing that cascading signaling pathways are less susceptible to crosstalk. Conclusion Thus, the common biological theme of cascading signaling pathways is advantageous for maintaining the fidelity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> memory <b>latch</b> {{in the presence of}} crosstalk. The experimental implementation <b>of</b> such <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> system will lead to novel approaches to cell control using synthetic proteins and will contribute to our understanding of why cells behave differently even when given the same stimulus. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} fixed-phase retiming, a new optimization technique {{for the design}} of low power digital circuits. In fixed-phase retiming, we first transform any given edge-triggered circuit into a two-phase level-clocked circuit by replacing each flip-flop by two level-sensitive latches. Subsequently, while keeping the latches clocked on one of the phases fixed, we attempt to reduce power dissipation by relocating the remaining latches on interconnections with high glitching activity and capacitive load. Since in standard cell design the capacitance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> is typically smaller than the input capacitance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> combinational gate, this transformation reduces power dissipation during the opaque phase of the <b>latch.</b> We give <b>a</b> boolean quadratic programming formulation of fixedphase retiming and describe an O(V 4 log V) -time algorithm for computing a fixed-phase retiming that minimizes power dissipation, where V is the number of combinational blocks in the circuit. 1 Introduc [...] ...|$|R
