40|$|Hereditary {{hemochromatosis}} {{is transmitted}} as an autosomal recessive trait. Analyses of pedigrees {{suggest that the}} frequency of disease (proportion of homozygous individuals) {{in the general population}} is approximately 0. 3 % and that approximately 11 % of the population are heterozygous. The genotype of 194 persons in 38 pedigrees was determined by HLA-A and HLA-B haplotyping. Likelihood analysis was then used to appraise the transferrin <b>saturation</b> <b>test</b> when used alone and in combination with the serum ferritin test to detect homozygosity and heterozygosity in these pedigrees. A single cut-off point of 55 % for transferrin saturation and a cut-off point at the 90 th percentile for the serum ferritin level were adequate for the detection of hemochromatosis if homozygosity was considered to be present when the results of one or both tests were positive. To further assess the value of the transferrin <b>saturation</b> <b>test</b> the percentages were stratified into five intervals. A percentage transferrin saturation of 75 or greater and a serum ferritin level above the 90 th percentile ruled in homozygosity, whereas a percentage transferrin saturation of less than 55 and a serum ferritin level at or below the 90 th percentile ruled it out with confidence. The probability of heterozygosity rose to 90 % when the percentage transferrin saturation was between 35 and 55 and the serum ferritin level was at or below the 90 th percentile. The use of five cut-off points allowed the probability of homozygosity and heterozygosity in a pedigree to be estimated for all values of transferrin saturation.

40|$|International audienceMineralogical and {{chemical}} variations were {{studied in the}} upper half of a 1 m thick discontinuous bentonite bed interlaminated in the Lower Cenomanian sedimentary formations of the northern Aquitaine basin (France). X-ray diffraction patterns obtained from the < 2 μm fraction in the Ca and K-saturated states were decomposed and compared to those calculated from decomposition parameters. They revealed the presence of two highly expandable illiteexpandable (I-Exp) mixed-layer minerals (MLMs). Relative proportions of the two MLMs steadily evolve with depth leading to the decrease of the cation exchange capacity and of the (Na + Ca) content towards the center of the bentonite bed. However, the system is essentially isochemical and Mg, Al, Si, K and Fe are roughly constant in the bulk samples. It is thought that the mineralogical zonation results from the initial stages of the smectite formation in an ash layer. In the Ca-saturated state, the expandable component of these MLMs was for the most part homogeneous with the presence of 2 sheets of ethylene glycol molecules in the interlayer. However, the heterogeneous hydration behaviour of these expandable layers was enhanced by the potassium <b>saturation</b> <b>test.</b> From this test, the presence of three layer types with contrasting layer charge was evidenced from their contrasting swelling abilities. The C 12 -alkylammonium <b>saturation</b> <b>test</b> applied to samples in which the octahedral charge had previously been neutralized (Hofmann-Klemen treatment) showed that the tetrahedral charge is located on specific layers. These layers are responsible for the heterogeneous hydration behaviour. Low-charge smectite layers are mostly octahedrally substituted, whereas for intermediate- and high charge layers this montmorillonitic charge is complemented by additional tetrahedral substitutions (0. 30 and 0. 35 - 0. 40 charge per O 10 (OH) 2, respectively) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSaturation {{discrimination}} {{has been}} reported to be affected early {{in the course of a}} disease. Our empirical data show a compressive curvi-linear relationship between opponent/nonopponent channel activity and saturation thresholds in normal trichromatic observers. This relationship can be explained by a model based on the Hurvich and Jameson saturation coefficient (1957), Psychology Reviews, 64, 384 – 404. The model considers effects of both selective and nonselective channel losses on saturation processing based on the assumption that disease produces elevated thresholds while maintaining normal psychometric response functions. Both the model and data support clinical observations of saturation losses occurring early in disease. However, the results also indicate that saturation may not be the best modality for monitoring long-term progression of such conditions. We suggest that the different processing characteristics for blue-yellow thresholds may yield added information for <b>saturation</b> <b>testing</b> under some circumstances and that saturation processing occurs at a higher cortical level.

Therefore, it explores the factors influencing the online shopping logistics service and the corresponding relationship between them, and designs corresponding optimization solutions to provide better services to customers, further improve customer satisfaction, establish a good image for the enterprise and improve the efficiency of enterprises. In order to explore the types and the mechanism of consumer online shopping logistics services, from the perspective of online shopping consumers, the evaluation information of online shoppers on the platform is taken as the object of study, using the octopus data collection tool from Tmall to grab a large number of comments, conducting the in-depth analysis and mining using grounded theory research method, and further extracting the main categories and types of logistics service factors through open coding, spindle coding and selective coding. The composition of online shopping logistics service factors is divided into 7 main categories, the main category relationship structure is further mined, and the factors influencing the quality of online shopping logistics service are summarized as four main types of distribution quality, perception experience, after-sales service quality and reliability. Based on the typical relational structure of the main category, the core category of "key influencing factors of online shopping logistics service satisfaction" is finally determined, and the role model of logistics service quality is analyzed. Using the semantic network analysis and theoretical <b>saturation</b> <b>test</b> to verify the types of logistics service quality factors and their mechanism of action, the semantic network analysis using the ROST Content Mining knowledge processing and content mining software to conduct the whole network analysis, and using word frequency analysis and keyword co-occurrence analysis, the results are verified; and the research results are further verified by theoretical <b>saturation</b> <b>test</b> using the original data method and reliability assessment method. The results show that: perceived experience is the direct driving factor of online shopping logistics services, which determines whether the customer conducts online shopping. The quality of after-sales service and reliability indirectly drives consumers' online shopping behavior by influencing perception experience, which is the indirect factor of online shopping logistics service. Delivery quality can not only directly affect the quality of online shopping logistics service but also indirectly affect the online shopping logistics service quality through the perception experience.

Each soil material is compacted to a range of formation dry densities and degrees-of-saturation. The test results show that seismic compression susceptibility decreases with increasing density and decreasing shear strain amplitude.
