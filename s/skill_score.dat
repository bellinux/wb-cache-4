50|$|Skills are {{classified}} into broad and speciality skills. Earning a specialty skill requires an associated broad skill, {{which requires a}} character to have sufficient associated ability points. Special skill is further classified into ranks, which affects the <b>skill's</b> <b>scores.</b> <b>Skill</b> <b>scores</b> are presented with the full score, half that score, and one-quarter that score. which represent the numbers needed to achieve Ordinary, Good, or Amazing successes in an action round respectively.|$|R
50|$|Probabilistic {{forecast}} skill scores may use metrics {{such as the}} Ranked Probabilistic <b>Skill</b> <b>Score</b> (RPSS) or the Continuous RPSS (CRPSS), among others. Categorical skill metrics such as the False Alarm Ratio (FAR), the Probability of Detection (POD), the Critical Success Index (CSI), and Equitable Threat Score (ETC) {{are also}} relevant for some forecasting applications. Skill is often, but not exclusively, expressed as the relative representation that compares the forecast performance of a particular forecast prediction {{to that of a}} reference, benchmark prediction—a formulation called a 'Skill Score'.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second example}} {{suggests}} a good method of normalizing a forecast {{before applying any}} skill measure. Most weather situations will cycle, since the Earth is forced by a highly regular energy source. A numerical weather model must accurately model both the seasonal cycle and (if finely resolved enough) the diurnal cycle. This output, however, adds no information content, since the same cycles are easily predicted from climatological data. Climatological cycles may be removed from both the model output and the [...] "truth" [...] data. Thus, the <b>skill</b> <b>score,</b> applied afterward, is more meaningful.|$|E
5000|$|BRP {{is similar}} to other generic systems such as GURPS, Hero System or Savage Worlds in that it uses a simple {{resolution}} method which can be broadly applied. BRP uses a core set of seven characteristics: Size, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Power, and Appearance or Charisma. From those, a character derives scores in various skills, expressed as percentages. These skill scores are the basis of play. When attempting an action, the player rolls percentile dice {{trying to get a}} result equal to or lower than the character's current <b>skill</b> <b>score.</b> Each incarnation of the BRP rules has changed or added to the core ideas and mechanics, so that games are not identical. For example, in Call of Cthulhu, skills may never be over 100%, while in Stormbringer skills in excess of 100% are within reach for all characters.

50|$|In Legend of Zagor, {{the reader}} must play {{one of four}} {{different}} heroes: Anvar the Barbarian, Braxus the Warrior, Stubble the Dwarf or Sallazar the Wizard. Each has different strengths and weaknesses. For example, Sallazar can subtract 2 from Test your Spot Skill rolls, understand some magical writing and cast magic spells at will that other characters need scrolls to use, but cannot wear any chain mail or plate mail armour and cannot use a two-handed weapon. Each character's scores must also be rolled in a different way. This aspect of the book has been criticised as the book is significantly more difficult playing with certain characters; in particular, players using Stubble or Sallazar have found {{it very difficult to}} complete the book. Sallazar is the most likely to have low ability scores, and the book's magic system requires that combatants win an attack round for their spells to affect the enemy, which means that unless he has a sufficiently high <b>SKILL</b> <b>score,</b> the advantage of magic is all but worthless.|$|E
5000|$|Forecast {{verification}} {{is important}} to understand the strength and weaknesses of the system and to build confidence in its results. For EFAS two types of verifications are applied. The first one is event-based - for each flood alert the hit, false alarm and misses are assessed. If a flood alert has been sent but no flooding was observed, a false alarm is counted. If somewhere in the basin flooding has been report, a hit it counted. If flooding has been reported for which an alert was not sent (even if the system itself simulated an event), a missed event is counted. The events are assessed through feedback reports and media throughout the year and reported during the EFAS annual meeting. In addition to the event-based verification, also skill scores are computed including Brier <b>Skill</b> <b>Score,</b> Root Mean Square Error, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, continuous rank probability score, etc. These are reported regularly in the EFAS bulletins and in publications. Skill analysis has been reported for example in,. More on skill scores can be found on HEPEX,.

40|$|Skill {{scores for}} rating {{quantitative}} forecasts are proposed {{to take into}} account the deviations occurring between forecast and observed values.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedSatellites and several specially equipped scientific aircraft provide basin-wide altimetric measurements of sea ice freeboard, from which sea ice thickness can be estimated. Up to now, few {{methods have been}} developed to use these measurements to quantitatively assess the skill of predictive models of sea ice for the Arctic. This thesis addresses this problem, using measured freeboard from ICESat and Operation IceBridge (OIB). Output from the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) is used to demonstrate applicability of both variance- and correlation-weighted <b>skill</b> <b>scores</b> of freeboard that quantify model skill and take measurement error into account. The techniques are demonstrated using two different RASM configurations, one using Elastic-Viscous-Plastic (EVP) ice mechanics, the other using the Elastic- Anisotropic-Plastic (EAP) rheology, both simulated for 2004 and 2007, during which ICESat was in operation. RASM variance <b>skill</b> <b>scores</b> ranged from 0. 712 to 0. 824 and correlation <b>skill</b> <b>scores</b> were between 0. 319 and 0. 511.

The QUADRICS Bologna Limited Area Model (QBOLAM), which is a parallel version of the Bologna Limited Area Model (BOLAM) described by Buzzi et al., is used, and it is verified on grids of about 10 km (grid-box size). The precipitation analysis is obtained {{by means of a}} Barnes objective analysis scheme. The rain gauge data are from the Piedmont and Liguria regions, in northwestern Italy. The data cover 243 days, from 1 October 2000 to 31 May 2001. The interpolation methods considered are bilinear interpolation and a simple nearest-neighbor averaging method, also known as remapping or budget interpolation, which maintains total precipitation to a desired degree of accuracy. A computer-based bootstrap technique is applied to perform hypothesis testing on nonparametric <b>skill</b> <b>scores,</b> in order to assess statistical significance of score differences. Small changes of the precipitation field induced by the two interpolation methods do affect <b>skill</b> <b>scores</b> in a statistically significant way. Bilinear interpolation affects <b>skill</b> <b>scores</b> more heavily, smoothing the maxima, and smearing and increasing the minima of the precipitation field over the grid. The remapping procedure seems to be more appropriate for performing high-resolution grid transformations, although the present work shows that a precipitation edge-smearing effect at lower precipitation thresholds exists. Equitable threat score is more affected than Hanssen–Kuipers score by the interpolation process, since this last score weights all kind of successes (hits and correct no-rain forecasts). Correct no-rain forecasts at higher thresholds often outnumber hits, misses, and false alarms, reducing the sensitivity to false alarm changes introduced by the interpolation process...|$|R

Within this context, a suite of state-of-the-art RCMs was employed for the creation of probabilistic future regional climate change scenarios for Europe. Among others, one measure to determine the individual RCM-weights is their ability to reproduce the observed trends in 2 m temperature in the reanalysis (ERA 40) -driven experiments for the period 1960 - 2000. As the reference, we used the new ENSEMBLES observational gridded dataset for Europe (E-OBS). As additional datasets for comparisons, we also used the near-surface temperature datasets from the CRU observations and from the ERA 40 and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. The analysis was performed for the land fraction of 8 different European regions, the so-called PRUDENCE regions defined within the PRUDENCE pr oject ([URL] Annual and seasonal linear trends in near-surface temperature were computed for each ENSEMBLES RCM, the E-OBS dataset, and for the additional datasets mentioned above.
