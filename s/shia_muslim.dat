5|$|Salih {{established}} a well-organized administration over his Aleppo-based domains. Militarily, he {{relied on the}} Banu Kilab, while entrusting fiscal administration to his local Christian vizier, policing to an urban militia commander and judicial matters to a <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslim</b> qāḍī. His rule was officially tolerated by the Fatimids, to whom he paid formal allegiance. However, his alliance with the Banu Tayy ultimately drew him into conflict with the Fatimid general, Anushtakin al-Dizbari, whose forces killed Salih in battle near Lake Tiberias. Salih was succeeded by his sons Thimal and Nasr.|$|E
5|$|The Assaf dynasty (also called Banu Assaf) were a Sunni Muslim {{and ethnic}} Turkmen dynasty of chieftains {{based in the}} Keserwan region of Mount Lebanon. They came to the {{aforementioned}} area in 1306 after being assigned by the Bahri Mamluks to guard the coastal region between Beirut and Jbeil and to check {{the power of the}} mostly <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslim</b> population at the time. During this period, they established their headquarters in Ghazir, which served as the Assafs' base throughout their rule.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{relationship}} existed between Zahir and the <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslim</b> peasants of Jabal Amil and their sheikhs. Zahir maintained {{law and order}} in Jabal Amil, while leaving its mostly Shia inhabitants to their own devices. The Shia also benefited economically from Zahir's monopoly of the cotton industry and their sheikhs provided him men of great military skill to support his struggle against the Ottoman authorities. Zahir was a key backer of the Shia in their war with the Druze Jumblatt clan and the Shihab dynasty under Mulhim Shihab, and likewise, Shia forces were critical to the defense of Zahir's sheikhdom against expeditions by the Ottoman governor of Damascus in 1771 and 1772.|$|E

25|$|The NGOs {{report that}} {{violence}} and propaganda against the country's Shia minority continues. <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslims</b> are frequently denied services {{in addition to}} being called derogatory names. Anti-Shia sentiment is spread through education at all levels. Clerics educated at Al-Azhar University publicly promote sectarian beliefs by calling <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslims</b> infidels and encourage isolation and marginalization of <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslims</b> in Egypt.|$|R

5|$|Abūʾl Nasr Manṣūr ibn Luʾluʾ, {{also known}} by his laqab (honorific epithet) of Murtaḍā al-Dawla ("Approved of the Dynasty"), was {{the ruler of}} the Emirate of Aleppo between 1008 and 1016. He succeeded his father Lu'lu' al-Kabir, {{with whom he had}} shared power. Unlike Lu'lu', however, Mansur's rule was opposed by Aleppo's notables, who chafed at his oppression and monopolization of power. Both Mansur and his father harassed the {{remaining}} members of the Hamdanid dynasty, in whose name they ostensibly ruled. On the diplomatic front, Mansur balanced ties with both the Byzantine Empire and the Fatimid Caliphate, and maintained the emirate's <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslim</b> orientation.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad's {{taxation}} {{was considered}} exploitative by Tripoli Eyalet's inhabitants. Yusuf Sayfa {{refused to pay}} taxes to Muhammad, prompting the latter to attempt collecting them through military means. However, while {{en route to the}} Akkar to pressure the Sayfas, Muhammad was shot dead outside of Tripoli on Yusuf Sayfa's orders in 1591. Muhammad's death with no male heirs marked the end of Assaf rule. Following his death, Yusuf Sayfa was transferred control of the Assafs' nawahi in Tripoli Eyalet, and he expelled the Hubaysh clan, promoting his <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslim</b> Hamade allies from Jbeil at their expense. In 1593, Yusuf Sayfa wed Muhammad's widow and thus acquired the Assafs' wealth. He concurrently took control over Keserwan and Assaf properties in Beirut.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Emir Assaf, they were confirmed as the rulers of Keserwan by Sultan Selim I following the Ottoman conquest in 1516. Emir Assaf died two years later and was succeeded by his son Hasan, who was in turn killed by his brother Qa'itbay. The latter ruled Keserwan until his death without children in 1523, after which he was succeeded by Hasan's son Mansur. Mansur had a long reign and was accorded by the Ottomans numerous districts in Mount Lebanon and its environs as tax farms. He eliminated many of his Sunni rivals, and his local power relied on a Maronite support base and his Maronite agents, namely members of the Hubaysh clan, {{who served as a}} check on the <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslim</b> sheikhs of Keserwan. At the peak of his power, Mansur's realm stretched from Beirut to Homs.|$|E

5000|$|Islam is {{historically}} {{divided into two}} major sects, Sunni and Shia Islam, {{each with its own}} sub-sects. Large numbers of <b>Shia</b> Arab <b>Muslims</b> live in some Arab countries including Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar. <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslims</b> are a numerical majority in Iraq and Bahrain. Approximately half of the population in Yemen are <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslims.</b> Exactly half of Muslims in Lebanon are <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslims.</b> There is also a very large population of <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslims</b> living in the Arab Persian Gulf countries especially in Saudi Arabia. Approximately the whole population of East Saudi Arabia, the Eastern Province are <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslims.</b> Although government statistics claim that roughly only 20-40% of the <b>Muslim</b> population are <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslims,</b> there has been dispute to the authenticity of this figure and recent reports and investigations indicate that there is in fact a much larger population of <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslims</b> present, with estimate figures over 45% or even making the majority of Muslim population. Saudi Arabia follows a strict recently established sect of Islam, Wahhabism, a off shoot of Sunni Islam and there is little freedom of religion between the different sects even whilst all of the population are <b>Muslims.</b> Smaller <b>Shia</b> groups are present in Egypt and Jordan. Despite the heavy presence of <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslims</b> in some Arab countries, particularly among the population of the Persian Gulf Arab countries, they have been treated poorly throughout history. Additionally, in recent times, <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslims</b> along with Kurds have faced genocide by the pan-Arabist regime of Saddam Hussein. [...] For both historical and political reasons, the Shia have fared rather poorly in much of the Arab world, and the topic of Shi‘ism and Shia groups {{is one of the most}} sensitive issues for the Sunni elite. [...] This article discusses both the history of Shī‘a Islam in the Arab world from the dawn of Islam and their current situation in the Arabic-speaking world.|$|R
50|$|As {{common among}} Salafi Wahhabists to {{strongly}} oppose <b>shia</b> <b>Muslims</b> and even consider them Infidels (see Anti-Shiism), Jafar in June 2013 {{once said that}} he would declare a jihad against Indonesian <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslims</b> which allegedly tried to intimidate a Sunni congregation in Bekasi.|$|R
5|$|Zahir {{successfully}} withstood assaults and sieges by the Ottoman {{governors of}} the Sidon and Damascus provinces, {{who attempted to}} limit or eliminate his influence. He was often supported in these confrontations by the rural <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslim</b> clans of Jabal Amil. In 1771, in alliance with Ali Bey al-Kabir of Egypt Eyalet and with backing from the Russian Empire, Zahir captured Sidon, while Ali Bey's forces conquered Damascus, both acts in open defiance of the Ottoman sultan. At {{the peak of his}} power in 1774, Zahir's autonomous sheikhdom extended from Beirut to Gaza and included the Jabal Amil and Jabal Ajlun regions. By then, however, Ali Bey had been killed, the Ottomans entered into a truce with the Russians, and the Sublime Porte felt secure enough to check Zahir's power. The Ottoman Navy attacked his Acre stronghold in the summer of 1775 and he was killed outside of its walls shortly after.|$|E
5|$|Zahir's {{conquest of}} the Safad region and western Galilee removed the {{barriers}} {{between him and the}} Metawali (<b>Shia</b> <b>Muslim)</b> clans of Jabal Amil. Zahir informed the Metawalis' sheikh, Nasif al-Nassar, of his intent to acquire the fortified villages of al-Bassa and Yaroun on the borders between the Zaydani and Metawali sheikhdoms. In response, Sheikh Nasif launched an assault against Zahir and the two sides confronted each other in indecisive skirmishes in the border village of Tarbikha. Zahir then received reinforcements from his Maghrebi cavalry and defeated the Metawalis, pursuing Sheikh Nasif to his headquarters in Tibnin. Zahir's brother Sa'd mediated an end to the fighting and secured a mutual defense pact between Zahir and Sheikh Nasif, whereby the former would receive control of al-Bassa and Yaroun and the Metawalis' support in his confrontations with the governors of Damascus; in return, Sheikh Nasif's sons, who were captured by Zahir's troops, were released, the Metawalis' tax payments to Sidon were reduced by some 25 percent, and Zahir guaranteed his backing of Sheikh Nasif in any confrontation with the governors of Sidon.|$|E
5|$|French forces {{commanded}} by General Henri Gouraud landed in Beirut on 18 November 1919, {{with the ultimate}} goal of bringing all of Syria under French control. Shortly thereafter, French forces deployed to the Beqaa Valley between Beirut and Damascus. Against King Faisal's wishes, his delegate to General Gouraud, Nuri al-Said, agreed to the French deployment and the disbandment of Arab troops from al-Mu'allaqa, near Zahle. The agreement between al-Said and Gouraud was contrary to an earlier agreement Faisal had made with French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, which held that French troops would not deploy in the Beqaa Valley until the League of Nations ruled on the matter. Faisal condemned al-Said and accused of him of treachery. Following the Arab Army withdrawal from al-Mu'allaqa, Christian militiamen from Zahle raided the town, prompting attacks from local Muslim militiamen, which forced several Christian families to the coast. Amid these developments, armed groups of rebels and bandits emerged throughout the Beqaa Valley. When a French officer in Baalbek was assaulted by <b>Shia</b> <b>Muslim</b> rebels opposed to the French presence, Gouraud held the Arab government responsible and demanded that it apologize, which it did not. In response, Gouraud violated his agreement with al-Said and occupied Baalbek. The French deployment along the Syrian coast and the Beqaa Valley provoked unrest throughout Syria and sharpened political divisions between the political camp calling for confronting the French and the camp preferring compromise.|$|E
