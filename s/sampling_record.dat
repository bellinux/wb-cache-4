50|$|Digital {{sampling}} technology, {{introduced in}} the 1980s, has become a staple of music production in the 2000s. Devices that use <b>sampling,</b> <b>record</b> a sound digitally (often a musical instrument, such as a piano or flute being played), and replay it when a key or pad on a controller device (e.g., an electronic keyboard, electronic drum pad, etc.) is pressed or triggered. Samplers can alter the sound using various audio effects and audio processing. Sampling {{has its roots in}} France with the sound experiments carried out by Musique Concrete practitioners.|$|E
50|$|Illegal Art is a <b>sampling</b> <b>record</b> {{label that}} {{was started in}} 1998. The label gained {{immediate}} notoriety from legal threats surrounding Deconstructing Beck, a compilation made exclusively from sampling Beck's music. This was followed by two other theme-based compilations, Extracted Celluloid and Commercial Ad Hoc. All three were co-released with Negativland's Seeland Records label and sponsored by RTMark. After these theme-based compilations, Illegal Art focused on artist releases. One {{of the most popular}} artists on the label is Girl Talk (Gregg Gillis), who in 2006 released his third album, Night Ripper, to critical acclaim on the label, earning a Wired magazine Rave Award a year later.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Trilobites, a {{dominant}} component of marine fau-nas during the Cambrian and Ordovician and which survived {{until the end}} of the Permian (542 – 251 Ma) have been used in many macroevolutionary analyses. Here, we use a discovery curve to document the sampling history of trilobites, which we consider a proxy for Palaeozoic faunas in general. At higher taxonomic ranks, orders, suborders and superfamilies, the fos-sil record has been completely sampled, while the family rank also shows a high level of sampling completeness, having reached an asymptote in 1970. Importantly, this levelling-off occurred even though worker effort continued to increase. However, at genus level the <b>sampling</b> <b>record</b> is incomplete, indicating that families should not be used as a proxy for gen-era. There is little variation among the different subsets of gen-eric data, with the sampling history of different stratigraphic periods and among different orders being very similar. How-ever, there is noticeable variation among geographical regions, caused by variations in worker effort, and this could cause problems when comparing speciation and diversity patterns across faunal provinces. The role of synonyms on sampling history has had little effect. Key words: Palaeozoic faunas, <b>sampling</b> <b>record,</b> fossil record, synonyms, trilobites. Palaeozoic faunas have been used to address many questions in evolutionary biology and palaeobiology...|$|E

40|$|The {{contribution}} was a timely notice that acoustic Doppler velocimeters have intrinsic weaknesses {{and that their}} signal outputs are not always "true" turbulence measurements. Herein it is demonstrated that, in steady open channel flows, the <b>sampling</b> <b>record</b> must be larger than 5, 000 samples to yield minimum errors on first and second statistical moments of the velocity components. Significantly longer records (more than 50, 000 samples) are required for accurate determination of higher statistical moments (e. g. skewness, kurtosis), Reynolds stresses and triple correlations. Further ADV signal outputs are adversely affected by the proximity of solid boundaries, particularly when the sampling volume is located less than 30 to 45 mm from the wall. Recent field observations in a small estuary showed also that ADV records may be affected by various disturbances including wildlife and man-made interferences. Comparative analyses of long duration, high-frequency data sets highlighted the needs for advanced post-processing techniques. It is hoped that the authors 2 ̆ 7 contribution and the present discussion will stress enough the needs to educate and adequately train technicians, engineers, scientists and researchers deploying ADVs in the field, including portable ADV systems...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is {{to reflect on the}} {{application}} of Critical Discourse Analysis to classroom interaction. In this reflection I focus on a reading session from a time <b>sampling</b> <b>record</b> of a language classroom where common strategies of initiation, response and evaluation take place between the teacher and pupils. The phonetic approach to teaching reading focused on exercises in letter sounds and the use of reading primers with highly controlled vocabularies to introduce initial consonant sounds of a language. Bryant (1994 : 246) in defense of the phonetic approach, explains: “Most literate people are all well aware that words and syllables consist of smaller units of sounds. This form of awareness is usually called “phonological awareness”, and there is a strong possibility that it plays an essential role in learning how to read”. Goswani and Bryant (1990) argue that children rely on their ability to recognize rhyming words in acquiring knowledge of new shapes and sounds. The importance of drilling activities and rhyming games in language classes, which focus the attention of the learner on the phonemic structure of words, have long been claimed to be an indispensable method in teaching reading though recognizing the constituent sounds of words (Bryant and Bradley, 1985). The audiolingual method and th...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a case {{history of the}} Mesa 1660 m dump failure (slide) at Quintette Coal Limited. The potential ability of dump slide material to filter suspended sediment from influent water is discussed and questions are raised regarding the amount of sediment generated by waste dumps. This paper presents data and theoretical arguments supporting the following claims: 1. That dump slide material filters suspended sediment- supported by:- Experience at an east Kootenay mine showing a dramatic decrease in sediment loads subsequent to a failure. - Experience at Quintette Coal Limited indicating that solids concentrations below the Mesa dump slide are less than upstream concentrations in 49 % of samples taken and of the same concentration in 30 %. Slight increases downstream are seen in 21 % of the data set. - Dye observations indicating that an approximate retention time in the slide mass is 69 hours. 2. That waste dumps {{are not likely to}} produce high sediment loads- supported by:- During the dumping process, fines remain in the upper 10 % of a waste dump and in this zone, based on specific tests in the Mesa north area, comprise clay particles (0. 002 mm) at 2 % and fine sand or silt (0. 075 mm) at 9 % of the samples taken. - Natural segregation of waste dumps will preclude downward migration of fines from the upper portion to lower regions of a waste dump. - An extensive history of waste dump drainage at QCL, including a five year <b>sampling</b> <b>record</b> indicating that negligible suspended sediment loads are generated...|$|E

40|$|The aims of this {{investigation}} was to create an updated view of the nitrate distribution for the country, to identify whether there are any gaps or significant changes in the distribution of nitrate concentration over the <b>sampling</b> <b>record</b> and identify areas where nitrate pollution occurs as an ecological hazard for priority research and remediation. Data was sourced from the national groundwater database for the entire country for the period up until 2008. Previous maps used data pre- 1990 and up to 2001. Additional nitrate data was sourced to supplement the NGDB data. The data was evaluated using excel pivot tables, and maps plotted using ArcMAP. Maps of the total count representing the total number of points sampled and their densities for South Africa, as well as the minimum, maximum and average nitrate concentration for the various decades were used to evaluate the extent and duration of nitrate pollution in South Africa. The nitrate concentrations were overlayed on the geological or hydroterrains and land cover for South Africa to investigate if there are links between lithology, land cover and nitrate concentrations. Comparison of maps compiled for different periods indicate that the Western Cape now has elevated nitrate levels, possibly associated with agricultural stock farming. The Northern Cape Province, in particular the Kalahari has elevated nitrate levels, but a distinct lack of recent sampling may mask the extent of the current spatial distribution of nitrate concentrations. The scarcity of sampling points within urban centres makes it difficult for pollution monitoring and control to take place...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to compile the inventory of nearly 100 years of research about the phytoplankton species cited for the coast of the state of São Paulo, Brazil. A state-of-the-art study on the local biodiversity has long been needed to provide a baseline for future comparisons. This type of data is scattered in old scientific journals and in the so-called "grey literature", and are in need of nomenclature updating. Twenty-six publications are considered. The earliest <b>sampling</b> <b>record</b> is from 1913 (?) and the most recent from 2002. This checklist compiled from the literature was complemented with primary data collected between August 2004 and July 2006, recent surveys of the surf-zone of 20 beaches located along the coast and of a mariculture farm at the Cocanha Beach, Caraguatatuba. The complete species list includes 572 taxa: most are diatoms (82 %), seconded by dinoflagellates (16 %), with a minor contribution of silicoflagellates, coccolithophorids, ebriideans and cyanobacteria. The most investigated areas were: Ubatuba, São Sebastião, Santos and Cananéia. The recent surveys have a broader spatial coverage. The objectives of the studies have changed over the years from purely taxonomic to process-oriented investigations. Therefore, the longest species lists and most first records for the area were published before the 1980 's and later publications, even those in which cell counts were performed, mention only the most abundant/frequent species. Electron microscopy was used for the first time in the present surveys, and new records include 38 diatoms, 42 dinoflagellates, 1 silicoflagellate, 1 ebriidean and 2 cyanobacteria. The use and interpretation of this species list require the perception of some constraints. It is not our role to question the identification made by other researchers. On the other hand, the ability to sample, analyze and identify species has evolved over the years and some considerations in this regard are presented...|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} the weak statistical stationarity of a random process is presented. The core of this testing procedure consists of generating an equivalent ensemble which approximates a true ensemble. Formation of an equivalent ensemble is accomplished through segmenting a sufficiently long time history of a random process into equal, finite, and statistically independent <b>sample</b> <b>records.</b> The weak statistical stationarity is ascertained based on the time invariance of the equivalent-ensemble averages. Comparison of these averages with their corresponding time averages over a single <b>sample</b> <b>record</b> leads to a heuristic estimate of the ergodicity of a random process. Specific variance tests are introduced for evaluating the statistical independence of the <b>sample</b> <b>records,</b> the time invariance of the equivalent-ensemble autocorrelations, and the ergodicity.

30|$|The {{existence}} of fires {{after the turn}} of the century is unique for fire history reconstructions in the Sierra Nevada and allows for comparison with the fire atlas (Figure 6). Although samples were not specifically collected to calibrate the fire atlas, Clusters 1, 2, and 5 were within the boundaries of mapped fires. Cluster 1 was within the perimeter of two fires; the first fire occurred in 1914 and then was subsequently re-burned in 1960. Nine out of the 11 <b>samples</b> <b>recorded</b> the 1914 fire but none recorded the 1960 fire. Cluster 2 was within the boundary of a 1926 fire with two <b>samples</b> <b>recording</b> the event. Cluster 5 was also within the 1960 fire, and three out of the five <b>samples</b> <b>recorded</b> this event. The fact that not all <b>samples</b> <b>recorded</b> the fires in the atlas can be testament to the patchy mosaic of fire in this ecosystem. Beaty and Taylor (2007) found that fire propagation and spread in the Lake Tahoe Basin was dictated more by the spatial pattern of fuels (abundance, pattern, and forest structure) rather than strictly by forest structure.|$|R
