Moreover, transfer occurred in the sagittal plane to coordination patterns that had symmetry properties {{similar to those of}} the to-be-learned pattern.

5000|$|Most recently, the {{geometric}} phase concept {{has been adopted}} for OAM generation. The geometric phase is modulated {{to coincide with the}} <b>spatial</b> <b>phase</b> dependence factor, i.e., [...] of an OAM carrying wave. In this way, geometric phase is introduced by using anisotropic scatterers. For example, a metamaterial composed of distributed linear polarizers in a rotational symmetric manner generates an OAM of order 1. To generate higher-order OAM wave, nano-antennas which can produce the spin-obit coupling effect are designed and then arranged to form a metasurface with different topological charges. Consequently, the transmitted wave carries an OAM, and its order is twice the value of the topological charge. Usually, the conversion efficiency is not high for the transmission-type metasurface. Alternative solution to achieve high transmittance is to use complementary (Babinet-inverted) metasurface. On the other hand, {{it is much easier to}} achieve high conversion efficiency, even 100% efficiency in the reflection-type metasurface such as the composite PEC-PMC metasurface.|$|E

50|$|Ultra high {{intensity}} lasers are now {{commonly used in}} several fields of physics research, including X-rays, wakefield acceleration, proton generation and ICF, with the common idea of intensely focusing a laser beam to energy densities that can reach 1022 W/cm2 on a target. To achieve such a goal, the laser beam typically passes through several amplification stages and is transported with larger and larger optical components. As a result, the beam is affected by thermal effects and optical aberrations which distort the wavefront and affect the focusing quality. This decreases light intensity on the target. Usually, both spectral and spatial phases are adaptively controlled {{in order to achieve}} the required focusing. Over the last 2 decades, adaptive optics for wavefront correction and beam shaping have been commonly used in laser facilities by means of a wavefront sensor that measures the <b>spatial</b> <b>phase</b> and a deformable mirror that corrects it.

40|$|The {{classification}} of cat retinal ganglion cells as X or Y {{on the basis}} of linearity or nonlinearity of spatial summation has been confirmed and extended. Recordings were taken from optic tract fibres of anaesthetized, paralysed cats. 2. When an alternating phase sine wave grating was used as a stimulus, X cells had null positions and Y cells responded at all positions of the grating. 3. These results did not depend on the temporal wave form or the temporal frequency of pattern alternation over a wide range. 4. At high spatial frequencies for the particular cell, a Y cell gave abig 'on-off' response, or frequency doubling, at all positions of the grating, while an X cell did not. 5. The use of contrast sensitivity versus <b>spatial</b> <b>phase</b> also served to differentiate the two cell types. With an alternating sine grating stimulus X cells had a sinusoidal dependence on <b>spatial</b> <b>phase,</b> while each Y cell's sensitivity depended in a complicated manner on <b>spatial</b> <b>phase.</b> 6.

40|$|International audienceDifferent {{mathematical}} tools, such as multidimensional analytic signals, {{allow for}} the calculation of 2 D <b>spatial</b> <b>phases</b> of real-value images. The motion estimation method proposed in this paper is based on two <b>spatial</b> <b>phases</b> of the 2 D analytic signal applied to cardiac sequences. By combining the information of these phases issued from analytic signals of two successive frames, we propose an analytical estimator for 2 D local displacements. To improve {{the accuracy of the}} motion estimation, a local bilinear deformation model is used within an iterative estimation scheme. The main advantages of our method are: (1) The phase-based method allows the displacement to be estimated with subpixel accuracy and is robust to image intensity variation in time; (2) Preliminary filtering is not required due to the bilinear model. The proposed algorithm, integrating phase-based optical flow motion estimation and the combination of global motion compensation with local bilinear transform, allows spatio-temporal cardiac motion analysis, e. g. strain and dense trajectory estimation over the cardiac cycle. Results from 7 realistic simulated tagged magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences show that our method is more accurate compared with state-of-the-art method for cardiac motion analysis and with another differential approach from the literature. The motion estimation errors (end point error) of the proposed method are reduced by about 33 % compared with that of the two methods. In our work, the frame-to-frame displacements are further accumulated in time, to {{allow for the}} calculation of myocardial Lagrangian cardiac strains and point trajectories. Indeed, from the estimated trajectories in time on 11 in vivo data sets (9 patients and 2 healthy volunteers), the shape of myocardial point trajectories belonging to pathological regions are clearly reduced in magnitude compared with the ones from normal regions.

It is known that temporal phase unwrapping is much faster than the more usual <b>spatial</b> <b>phase</b> unwrapping methods, and can be implemented in real-time system. In addition, this method offers an increasing range, handles discontinuities in the object. However, since this method should combine images from different CCD into one single formulation, images distortion and image intensity adjustment problems arise then.
