But Emma refuses to believe Ingrid when she warns her that Gold only wanted to hurt her for his own self-benefits. Emma notices that the image is an {{illusion}} {{as she tries to}} touch Ingrid, so she returns to the car and speeds off to the mansion. As Emma arrives at the place, Gold sets up the hat to absorb her and her powers in a closed room. Emma waits for Gold at the other side, and before she opens the door, Gold appears behind her, telling Emma that everything will be fine once her powers are gone, and that she will be able to live a normal life. Emma then thanks Gold, not knowing will happen next as she ponders about opening the door.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Stronger" [...] {{was directed by}} Alison Murray. It was filmed in September 2002 at a swimming pool, located in London. Range played a stripper in the video, while Buena portrayed a gangster and Buchanan was a heartbroken woman. Range described being semi-naked {{in front of the}} camera as [...] "weird, and very invasive". The video opens with a scene of Buena in a moving car down the streets in London, where she is sitting next to a man on the phone. She boils up the courage to leave her superstar boyfriend. After the car stops at a red light, <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it and walks away, leaving her boyfriend behind yelling at her.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Carey at a photoshoot {{in a private}} room at the Plaza Hotel, {{speaking}} the line, [...] "And I was like, {{why are you so}} obsessed with me?" [...] Next, a Rolls-Royce Phantom is shown pulling up to the hotel, with Carey stepping out of the vehicle. As <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the car, Carey dressed as a bellhop, assists her to the ramp where she is walking and greeting fans. The next scene finds Carey walking into the hotel, and waving to everyone, with the camera zooming to the bellhops face to reveal him intently staring at her. As the first verse begins, Carey is shown at the photo-shoot in the hotel, with a cameo by Patrick Demarchelier as the photographer. The bellhop, now dressed in a gray hoodie and sweatpants, is shown holding a hair-blower at Carey, apparently assisting with the shoot. As the shoot continues, scenes of the bellhop are shown in his room, where he has dolls of Carey on the wall, as well as quilts with the cover of her 2005 album, The Emancipation of Mimi.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 6, 1910. It states: [...] "Mr. Jenks {{and his family are}} spending the summer in a fashionable summer hotel, and Mr. Jenks is kept bored and busy performing the many services demanded by his wife. He hits upon the bright idea of sending himself a business telegram which would necessitate his immediate presence in the city, then starts out on a little vacation on his own account. Walking on the beach he discovers a secluded spot, and leaving his clothes on the beach he takes a swim. In the meantime, a convict, who has escaped from a nearby penitentiary, has entered a house nearby in search of a change of clothes, his stripes being too conspicuous. The convict locks a woman of the house up and ransacks the house, but the only garments he can find are women's clothes, and, deciding that they are better than stripes, he dons them. As the convict in his new disguise is walking along the beach he sees Jenks' clothes lying there and promptly makes another change. There is nothing for Jenks to do when he comes out except to array himself as a woman. On {{his way back to the}} hotel he passes the house that has been robbed and is unlucky enough to hear the woman's cry for help. When <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the closet, through his aid, she naturally believes that he is the convict, and screams for help. Jenks, frightened, runs away, but is captured after a chase in which the entire village takes part. His wife and daughter witness humiliation, and it's almost impossible for them to 'square things.'" ...|$|E

When she talks, she has only a decorative value as a witness, either for or against herself, for she deals mainly in unsupported assertion; and in the rare cases where she puts forward a verifiable fact <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it a meaning which it refuses to furnish to anybody else. Also, when she talks, she is unstable, she wanders, she is incurably inconsistent; what she says to-day she contradicts tomorrow.|$|E

5000|$|She was {{the musical}} {{supervisor}} and orchestrator of {{the revival of}} Sweeney Todd, which started at the Watermill Theatre in 2004 and transferred to both the West End (2004) and Broadway (2005). Stephen Sondheim said of Travis' work on this production: [...] "I think what she's done is absolutely brilliant.... The variety <b>of</b> sounds <b>she's</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the instruments and also the practical {{way in which they}} allow John Doyle to work with the performers onstage is extraordinary. But what got me most about the orchestrations is what they did for the play's atmosphere. These are wonderfully weird textures." ...|$|R
6000|$|This story, {{like that}} of the Saracen Friends, is told by a damsel to a knight while riding in his company; with this difference, that she is the heroine of it herself. She is a damsel of a nature still lighter than the former; and the reader's sympathy with the trouble she brings on herself, and the way <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it, will be {{modified}} accordingly. On the other hand, nobody can respect the foolish old man with his unwarrantable marriage; and the moral of Boiardo's story is still useful for these [...] "enlightened times," [...] though conveyed with an air of levity.|$|E

"Martin," [...] said she, {{returning}} {{into the}} little sitting-room, and carefully shutting the door after her, [...] "you're the biggest bosthoon of a gandher I ever see, to be losing your opportunities with Anty this way!

Do you think a young woman don't expect something more from a lover than jist for you to sit by her, and go on all as one {{as though she was}} one of your own sisthers? Av' once <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this before the priest has made one of the two of you, mind, I tell you, it'll be all up with you.

But that dear sweet blessed thing is very much the same lost secret as the dear sweet blessed OTHER thing that went away with it--the decent leisure that, for the most part, we've also seen the last of. It's the thing at any rate that poor Nanda and all her kind have most effectually got rid of. Oh if you'd trust me a little more you'd see that I'm quite at one with you on all the changes for the worse. I bear up, but I'm old enough to have known. All the same Mrs. Brook has something--say what you like--when she bends that little brown head. Dieu sait comme elle se coiffe, but what <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it!

But it is wonderful how Miranda has bloomed out since her marriage. She isn't the same girl at all. Even her eyes seem to have darkened and deepened--though I suppose that is just because they glow with the greater intensity that has come to her. She makes her father stand round in a perfectly amazing fashion; she runs up the flag whenever a yard of trench on the western front is taken; and she comes up regularly to our Junior Red Cross; and she does--yes, she does--put on funny little 'married woman' airs that are quite killing. But she is the only war-bride in the Glen and surely nobody need grudge her the satisfaction <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|Bromfield Corey {{addressed}} {{himself again}} to Mrs. Lapham, and the talk subdivided itself as before. It lapsed so entirely {{away from the}} subject just in hand, that Lapham was left with rather a good idea, as he thought it, to perish in his mind, {{for want of a}} chance to express it. The only thing like a recurrence to what they had been saying was Bromfield Corey's warning Mrs. Lapham, in some connection that Lapham lost, against Miss Kingsbury. [...] "She's worse," [...] he was saying, [...] "when it comes to appropriations than Seymour himself. Depend upon it, Mrs. Lapham, she will give you no peace of your mind, now she's met you, from this out. Her tender mercies are cruel; and I leave you to supply the content from your own scriptural knowledge. Beware of her, and all her works. She calls them works of charity; but heaven knows whether they are. It don't stand to reason that she gives the poor ALL the money <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> people.

60|$|Poor Lizzie {{felt that}} fresh trouble was {{certainly}} coming upon her.

At any rate, they could not take her income away from her. But how could <b>she</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way, and how could she endure to be cross-examined, and looked at, and inquired into, by all those who would be concerned in the matter? She thought that, if only she could have arranged her matrimonial affairs before the bad day came upon her, she could have endured it better. If she might be allowed to see Lord George, she could ask for advice,--could ask for advice, not as she was always forced to do from her cousin, on a false statement of facts, but with everything known and declared.|$|R
