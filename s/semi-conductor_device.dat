40|$|Abstract—We {{report on}} a new concept for InGaAsP–InP 1. 55 - m lasers with {{integrated}} spot-size converters (SSCs) based on antiresonant reflecting optical waveguides (ARROW). The mode expanders consist of a laterally tapered active region {{on top of a}} fiber-matched passive slab waveguide. The large slab mode is laterally confined by an antiresonant configuration of a couple of lateral waveguides defined in the same fabrication process as the active ridge. This feature makes the presented spot-size transformer as simple to fabricate as a standard waveguide, only requiring a planar growth step and a single conventional etch process. The fabricated tapers exhibit a low transformation loss and reduce the coupling loss to standard single-mode fibers from 8 to 4 dB. We also analyze by simulation two variants of the concept proposed in this work, including a taper structure for a buried waveguide, which are expected to show better performance. Simulation results show fiber-coupling efficiencies as low as 2. 4 and 1. 1 dB for both variants.

40|$|Abstract—Carrier {{trapping}} via tunneling {{into the}} gate oxide was implemented into a partial differential equation-based semicon-ductor device simulator to analyze the-like noise in silicon MOSFETs. Local noise sources are calculated using the carrier tunneling rates between trap {{centers in the}} oxide and those at the interface. Using the Green’s transfer function approach, noise con-tributions from each node in the oxide mesh to the overall noise at the specified contact terminals are simulated. Unlike traditional noise analyses in MOSFETs, the simulator is capable of simu-lating noise {{for a wide range}} of bias voltages and device structures. The simulation results show that for an uniformly doped channel, the region in the oxide above the pinch-off point in saturation is most critical for low frequency noise generation while for a graded channel device the source side of the gate oxide region becomes im-portant. By comparing the simulation results with the measured noise data, the oxide defect density in the noise producing regions can be profiled.
