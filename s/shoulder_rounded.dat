5000|$|The {{height of}} the shell attains 10 mm. The solid, umbilicate shell has a conical shape and is pointed at the apex, {{slightly}} angled on the <b>shoulder,</b> <b>rounded</b> at the periphery and flattened on the base. It contains seven whorls. The colour, on the last three whorls, consists of oblique and zigzag brick-red stripes extending from suture to the periphery Between these {{as well as on}} the apex and base, the shell is pale cream.|$|E
5000|$|The conical spire is high, {{about the}} same height as the aperture. The protoconch is blunt, rounded and {{contains}} 2 smooth globular whorls. The teleoconch contains 8 broad, short whorls that are regularly increasing, the last rather large, with a sloping slightly concave shoulder, straight below the keel. At {{the top of each}} whorl there is a slight collar, which gives the effect of a slight canaliculation to the suture. The base of the shell is somewhat swollen, prolonged into a short broad unequal-sided beak. The suture is strong and slightly canaliculated. The aperture is large, almost rhomboidally pear-shaped, sharply angled above, and with a broad open canal below. The outer lip regularly curved, thin and sharp, with an open V-shaped sinus at the <b>shoulder,</b> <b>rounded</b> at the angle. Below this it sweeps downwards and a little forwards, forming a very low-shouldered wing. Towards {{the lower part of the}} aperture it curves very regularly backwards to the point of the pillar. The columella is narrow and short, very obliquely truncate below, with a fine, but strong, sharpish twisted edge. The inner lip is polished and porcellanous, rather broadly excavated in the substance of the shell; scarcely convex on the parietal wall, very slightly concave at the junction with the columella.|$|E
5000|$|... (Original description) The shell has an irregularly biconic shap , {{resembling}} Eucithara decussata (Pease, 1868). and Eucithara delacouriana (Crosse, 1869) in shape. The {{shell is}} thick and solid. Its color is whitish, indistinctly marked with about 4 yellowish {{spots on the}} front slope of each rib, and corresponding brown spots on the lip-varix, and with a band composed of 4 to 6 purple-brow lines below the suture. The sculpture shows longitudinal rounded ribs parted by wider concave intervals, and 10 or 11 in number on the body whorl. The last rib is much larger and forms the lip-varix. About 30 spiral threads, on the body whorl, cross the ribs and intervals, sometimes with minor threads between them. The spaces between these threads are evenly granulose by the decussation of growth lines and spiral striae, there being about four spiral series of granides in each interval. The shell contains 7½ whorls. The 2½ whorls in the protoconch are smooth and rounded, the rest subangular in the middle. The body whorl is shouldered above, the <b>shoulder</b> <b>rounded.</b> The aperture is narrow. The outer lip is nearly straight, with about 8 white teeth within. The columella is white, with four or five small entering folds, increased to 8 or 10 at the margin, and with several on the parietal wall.|$|E

2500|$|The fashionable {{feminine}} figure, {{with its}} sloping <b>shoulders,</b> <b>rounded</b> bust, narrow waist and full hips, was emphasized {{in various ways}} with the cut and trim of gowns. [...] To about 1835, the small waist was accentuated with a wide belt (a fashion continuing from the 1820s). [...] Later the waist and midriff were unbelted but cut close to the body, and the bodice began to taper to a small point at the front waist. [...] The fashionable corset now had gores to individually cup the breasts, and the bodice was styled to emphasize this shape.|$|R
