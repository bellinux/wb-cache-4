50|$|The British Royal {{family has}} held a long {{affinity}} with the sturgeon since 1324, when Edward II decreed it a Royal Fish, whereby all sturgeons {{found within the}} foreshore of the Kingdom are decreed property of the monarch.

40|$|The lipid {{profile of}} <b>Sturgeon</b> roe (<b>caviar)</b> was {{monitored}} by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI(+) -MS), thermal imprinting easy ambient sonic-spray ionization mass spectrometry (TI-EASI(+) -MS) and electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI(+) -MS). Freshly salted and commercially salted pasteurized caviar samples of Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser sturio) were stored either at + 4 degrees C {{or at room}} temperature for 4 weeks. The different types of chemical information achieved by these MS techniques were compared: MALDI(+) -MS detects mainly phospholipids (PL) whereas TI-EASI(+) -MS allows monitoring of both triacylglycerols (TAG) and PL. ESI(+) coupled to Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance high resolution mass spectrometer (FT-ICR-MS) and MS/MS experiments were used to fully characterize the detected lipids, ensure the absence of oxidation products in the degradation process and confirm the high efficiency of the thermal imprinting extraction.

40|$|Research {{developing}} artificial propagation, husbandry, {{and nutrition}} of sturgeon species has developed greatly {{since the collapse}} of the Caspian Sea fisheries in the 1980 s. Sturgeon species are commercially prized for their unfertilized roe which is marketed as the delicacy, <b>caviar.</b> <b>Sturgeon</b> production units commonly utilize commercial salmonid feeds, which contain large proportions of fish meal (FM) and fish oil (FO). Concerns regarding economics and sustainability have put pressure on aquafeed manufactures to efficiently utilize FM and FO, and to incorporate alternative protein sources, such as soybean meal (SBM). Therefore, the present studies estimated the optimal protein:energy ratio of juvenile Pallid Sturgeon Scaphirhynchus albus and evaluated the effects of increasing SBM composition on growth, feed efficiency, body and liver composition, and intestinal morphology of juvenile Shovelnose Sturgeon Scaphirhynchus platorhynchus, two species of Scaphirhynchus sturgeon of regional commercial importance. Protein:energy ratios were investigated using casein and dextrose based, semi-purified diets. Results indicated that Scaphirhynchus sturgeon are able to perform similarly across a wide range of protein:energy ratios (79 - 147 mg protein kcal- 1), so long as adequate dietary energy (3, 800 kcal kg- 1 gross energy) is provided and essential amino acids are not limiting. Soybean meal was evaluated utilizing practical, isocaloric, isolipidic, isoenergetic test diets, designed to replace FM with increasing SBM. Juvenile Scaphirhynchus sturgeon were found to perform similarly on diets with up to 50 % of FM replaced with SBM (336 g kg- 1 diet). Evaluation of liver composition revealed that juvenile Shovelnose Sturgeon store less glycogen and crude lipid than other fish species, although no dietary differences were observed. Histological evaluation of the distal intestine revealed indications of SBM induced enteritis, though no statistical differences in measures were detected between treatments.
