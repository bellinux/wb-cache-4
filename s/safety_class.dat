500|$|On March 18, 2013, the Kentucky Executive Branch Ethics Commission charged Farmer with 42 state ethics violations, {{the most}} ever {{registered}} against a single individual; the previous high was 16. Most {{of the charges}} against him stemmed from the previous year's auditor's report, but previously unreported charges included conspiring with his sister Rhonda, who was also charged, to falsify records submitted to Rhonda's employer, the Registry of Election Finance. Farmer's girlfriend was also charged for falsifying timesheets. These charges were followed by five indictments by a federal grand jury on April 19, 2013, alleging four counts of converting state funds and property to personal use and one count of soliciting a bribe in exchange for a state grant. U.S. Attorney Kerry B. Harvey said a federal investigation revealed that Farmer had created jobs in the department for his friends and girlfriend, who conducted personal errands for Farmer [...] including [...] "building a basketball court for Farmer, placing flooring in Farmer's attic and organizing Farmer's personal effects" [...] while on the clock. He also said that Farmer had kept some of the gifts ordered in conjunction with the 2008 Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture conference for his own use and allowed his family to stay in hotel rooms reserved for agriculture department employees at the Kentucky State Fair. The indictment did not specify what bribe was sought in exchange for a grant to conduct an all-terrain vehicle <b>safety</b> <b>class,</b> but the charges from the state Ethics Commission mentioned that Farmer had received three all-terrain vehicles in exchange for awarding unspecified state grants. A Lexington Herald-Leader report noted that the indictment only included events from 2008 forward because the statute of limitations had expired for any actions prior to 2008.|$|E
2500|$|On August 1, , the {{day before}} {{the first anniversary of the}} accident, the Yankees filed a $4.5-million lawsuit against Cessna Aircraft Co. and Flight Safety International, Inc. (the company who was {{training}} Munson to fly), with team spokesman John J. McCarty saying [...] "we asked for $4.5 million because that is what Munson would be worth if the Yankees traded him." [...] Munson's widow, Diana, also filed a $42.2 million wrongful death lawsuit against the two companies. Cessna offered Munson a special deal on flying lessons if he would take them from FlightSafety International. Rather than requiring Munson to take a two-week <b>safety</b> <b>class</b> in Kansas, FlightSafety assigned a [...] "traveling instructor" [...] to go on the road with him, and train him between ballgames. The suit was eventually settled out of court.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2008, Locklear {{was pulled}} over and arrested on {{suspicion}} of {{driving under the influence}} by a California Highway Patrol officer just outside Santa Barbara after she was seen driving erratically. Police had been tipped off about Locklear's driving by Jill Ishkanian, a former reporter and editor at Us Weekly magazine, who saw Locklear outside a market in Montecito, California. Ishkanian photographed the incident and then sold the photos to celebrity news website TMZ.com for $27,500, though she claims it was entirely a chance meeting and denies following Locklear or setting her up to obtain photographs. Locklear was formally charged on November 17, 2008, with one misdemeanor count of driving under the influence. A blood test detected no alcohol or illegal narcotics, but Santa Barbara County Deputy District Attorney Lee Carter stated that they believe the prescription medications she consumed for her anxiety and depression [...] "could have impaired her ability to safely drive a motor vehicle". On January 2, 2009, Locklear pleaded no contest to reckless driving, and in return the district attorney dismissed the DUI charges. Locklear was sentenced to three years of informal probation, a DMV driver <b>safety</b> <b>class,</b> and a $700 fine.|$|E

2500|$|Chainsaw {{protective}} fabric {{works on}} a number of principles. The outermost layer can be made both tough and slippery, to protect against minor damage which could compromise the filler material. Beneath this, long, loose fibres of polyester, Avertic, ballistic nylon or Kevlar are laid in layers. When a saw contacts the trousers, the outer layer is immediately cut through but the inner is drawn out and wraps around the saw's drive sprocket, locking it solid and halting the chain, limiting damage to the operator's leg. The length of the fabrics and number of layers match the <b>safety</b> <b>class.</b> In case of an accident the fabric is pulled out of the upper and lower seam and wrap around the sprocket as described above. Protection is only given for gas [...] chain saws, not for electrical saws. Trousers should be slightly baggy, so that there is give, to prevent the chain pulling the operator's leg into the chainsaw. Instead the 'baggy' excess fabric is pulled out and into the chain mechanism, thereby stopping the saw. After stopping a saw, the damaged trousers must be scrapped, having done their job.|$|E
