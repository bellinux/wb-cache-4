25|$|Early garbage removal {{trucks were}} simply open bodied dump trucks pulled {{by a team}} of horses. They became {{motorized}} {{in the early part of}} the 20th century and the first close body trucks to eliminate odours with a dumping lever mechanism were introduced in the 1920s in Britain. These were soon equipped with 'hopper mechanisms' where the <b>scooper</b> was loaded at floor level and then hoisted mechanically to deposit the waste in the truck. The Garwood Load Packer was the first truck in 1938, to incorporate a hydraulic compactor.|$|E

500|$|Another bill Milk {{concentrated}} on {{was designed to}} solve the number one problem {{according to a recent}} citywide poll: dog excrement. Within a month of being sworn in, he began to work on a city ordinance to require dog owners to scoop their pets' feces. Dubbed the [...] "pooper <b>scooper</b> law", its authorization by the Board of Supervisors was covered extensively by television and newspapers in San Francisco. Anne Kronenberg, Milk's campaign manager, called him [...] "a master at figuring out what would get him covered in the newspaper". He invited the press to Duboce Park to explain why it was necessary, and while cameras were rolling, stepped in the offending substance, seemingly by mistake. His staffers, however, knew he had been at the park for an hour before the press conference looking for the right place to walk in front of the cameras. It earned him the most fan mail of his tenure in politics and went out on national news releases.|$|E
2500|$|The IDF {{produced}} a video about Corrie's death that includes footage taken {{from inside the}} cockpit of a D9. The video makes a [...] "credible case", wrote Joshua Hammer in Mother Jones, that [...] "the operators, peering out through narrow, double-glazed, bulletproof windows, their view obscured behind pistons and the giant <b>scooper,</b> might not have seen Corrie kneeling in front of them".|$|E

50|$|The Lichtenfelser {{are also}} called, in a sneering kind of way, the <b>scoopers</b> {{of the pool}} (Tümpelschöpfer). This name they {{obtained}} from the Thirty Years' War (1618 - 1648), from attempting to retrieve hidden sunken treasures in a pond, which they could not empty out due to rapidly running groundwater.|$|R

50|$|Day 48: Concerned about Ejay's {{welfare in}} {{performing}} his punishment, Josef, Nan, and Alex {{were permitted to}} help Ejay by each giving them plastic spoons as <b>scoopers.</b> The four boys' efforts paid off and the punishment of filling the water drum 50 times with water from the swimming pool was finished. Big Brother thus lifted the ban on using the pool.|$|R

50|$|In its {{original}} form, the plays prologue was a dialog between Henny, an aged, ailing mother whose {{breast cancer is}} referenced in the plays title, and <b>Scooper,</b> her son; the first act involved <b>Scooper</b> and Deirdre, a girl who is another patient of Scoopers psychiatrist; and the second act focused again mainly on Henny and <b>Scooper.</b> This segmented structure, and the plays rapid shifts between comedy and suffering, were not successful with early critics and audiences.|$|E

50|$|A pooper-scooper, or poop scoop, is {{a device}} used {{to pick up}} animal feces from public places and yards, {{particularly}} those of dogs. Pooper-scooper devices often have a bag or bag attachment. 'Poop bags' are alternatives to pooper <b>scoopers,</b> and are simply a bag, usually turned inside out, to carry the feces to a proper disposal area. Sometimes, the person performing the cleanup {{is also known as}} the pooper-scooper.|$|R
25|$|The studio {{had kept}} {{knowledge}} of the project secret from the online community, a cited rarity due {{to the presence of}} <b>scoopers</b> that follow upcoming films. The controlled release of information on the film has been observed as a risky strategy, which could succeed like The Blair Witch Project (1999) or disappoint like Snakes on a Plane (2006), the latter of which had generated online hype but failed to attract large audiences.|$|R

5000|$|The Show Place Ice Cream Parlour {{opened in}} 1975 by Hayes, in {{partnership}} with banker Scott Henderson, in a former bakery next to the theatre. This facility sold ice cream and presented a cabaret show. In 1976 Hayes died and was succeeded by Eleanor Miller. When Hayes died suddenly in 1976 Michael Curry, a college student, took over day-to-day management.

40|$|Rychłowice, site 1 is {{situated}} about 3 km {{to the south}} of Wieluń between Rychłowice and Nowy Świat valley. It is on the high hill which was partially destroyed due to gravel exploration there. Two seasons of rescue excavations uncovered 26 settlement pits. Five of them served domestic needs, one possessed a fire place, the other a fire place and postpits around it. Seventeen of them were farming structures. Four pits are difficult to be qualified for either group. The pottery assemblage consists of two-conical, and vase-like vessels, amphoras, egg-like pots, mugs, <b>scoopers,</b> bowls and plates. Bronze artefacts are worth mentioning, namely a little spearhead, ring and ear-ring. Pottery forms of Rychłowice and their ornamentation classify the site to the fifth period of Bronze Age (900 - 700 BC acc. to O. Montelius). At the site there appeared pottery material characteristic for Kępno undergroup of the Upper-Silesian-Little Poland Lusatian culture.
