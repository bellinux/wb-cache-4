5000|$|A {{non-bank}} {{financial institution}} (NBFI) is a financial institution {{that does not have}} a full banking license or is not supervised by a national or international banking regulatory agency. NBFIs facilitate bank-related financial services, such as investment, risk pooling, contractual savings, and market brokering. Examples of these include insurance firms, pawn <b>shops,</b> <b>cashier's</b> check issuers, check cashing locations, payday lending, currency exchanges, and microloan organizations. Alan Greenspan has identified the role of NBFIs in strengthening an economy, as they provide [...] "multiple alternatives to transform an economy's savings into capital investment which act as backup facilities should the primary form of intermediation fail." ...|$|R

40|$|Money is {{a recent}} {{phenomenon}} in the evolutionary history of man and therefore no separate brain centre to handle money {{is likely to have}} evolved. The brain areas activated by food reward and money reward are extensively overlapping. In an experimental set-up, hunger was demonstrated to influence money related decisions and money related thoughts to influence hunger. This suggests that the brain areas evolved for handling food related emotions are exapted to handle money and therefore there could be a neuronal cross-talk between food and money. If this is true then attitude and behavior related to money and wealth could influence obesity. We conducted a survey of 211 individuals working as full time cashiers in order to test whether ownership over the cash, the amount of cash handled per day and the duration of cash handling work affected their body mass index (BMI). Cashiers who had ownership over the money had a significantly higher age corrected mean BMI than salaried cashiers. The BMI correlated positively with duration of service as cashier even after correcting for age and duration of sedentary job in males. Among salaried cashiers of both sexes, bank cashiers whose mean daily cash handling was one or two orders of magnitude greater than that of <b>shop</b> <b>cashiers,</b> had a significantly higher BMI. The effects of amount of money handled per day, years of service as cashier and ownership over the money handled could be shown to influence BMI independent of each other. The results support the exaptation hypothesis and suggest that the changing economy and attitudes towards money may be a contributing factor to the current obesity epidemic...|$|R

50|$|In a <b>shop,</b> a <b>cashier</b> (or {{checkout}} operator) is {{a person}} who scans the goods through a cash register that the customer wishes to purchase at the retail store. The items are scanned by a barcode positioned on the item {{with the use of a}} laser scanner. After all of the goods have been scanned, the cashier then collects the payment (in cash, check and/or by credit/debit card) for the goods or services exchanged, records the amount received, makes change, and issues receipts or tickets to customers. Cashiers will record amounts received and may prepare reports of transactions, reads and record totals shown on cash register tape and verify against cash on hand. A cashier may be required to know value and features of items for which money is received; may cash checks; may give cash refunds or issue credit memorandums to customers for returned merchandise; and may operate ticket-dispensing machines and the like.|$|R

40|$|Background  The role {{of nickel}} in causing hand {{dermatitis}} in some occupations {{has been difficult}} to assess due to problems with reliable measurement of the exposure to nickel in the workplace and lack of a definitive threshold for nickel allergic contact dermatitis. It is not uncommon to find nickel allergy on patch testing {{but it is difficult to}} determine whether this is of relevance to occupational nickel exposure or simply a reflection of past exposure to nickel-plated jewellery or other nonoccupational nickel exposure. Objectives  To devise a simple and reproducible method to quantify the amount of nickel on the skin and to apply the technique to measure dermal nickel exposure in various occupational settings. Methods  A rapid and simple sampling procedure was developed for determination of nickel on the skin of workers potentially exposed to nickel by exposing individuals to nickel-releasing coins and measuring exposure by immersing the exposed thumbs and index fingers directly into graduated sample tubes containing ultrapure water and aqueous nickel extracts. The solutions were analysed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry after stabilization with nitric acid. The method shows advantages over alternatives such as wipe testing and tape stripping in terms of extraction efficiency, speed and ease of operation in the field. A pilot survey of dermal nickel exposure for workers in several occupational settings was conducted. Results  The study suggested that a ‘normal’ level of nickel on the skin is < 10 ng cm− 2. Coin handling induced an appreciable increase in the amount of nickel on the skin within 2 min. Experiments indicated a linear relationship between coin handling (exposure time) and measured dermal nickel levels following standardized coin handling. A pilot survey, conducted among <b>cashiers,</b> <b>shop</b> assistants, bar staff, hairdressers and workers in the nickel industry revealed dermal nickel concentrations ranging from < 0 · 9 to 7160 ng cm− 2. The levels of nickel on the skin of <b>cashiers,</b> <b>shop</b> assistants, bar staff and hairdressers were below the threshold level for water-soluble ionic nickel for occluded exposure at which 10...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{market is}} one of the fast growing {{retailers}} in Indonesia. Almost every town in Indonesia there is modern markets, such as mall, supermarket, department store, shopping center, franchise, mini market, groceries, drugstores, and restaurants. People with different characteristics began to visit modern market to buy goods and services. This kind of market has various goods, either domestics and imports, has various qualities, different supplies in the stock of warehouses, own price tags, and differ service level (air conditioning, comfort and clean atmospheres, goods display separated to the subcategories, product information through reading machine, <b>shopping</b> baskets, <b>cashiers,</b> and shopkeepers). That’s mean it’s many thing can attractive consumer interest for buying in modern market. This study intended to find out the level of buying interests differences in modern market toward students in terms of personality types. This study is non­experiment research. The population of the study was students of Muhammadiyah University Malang. The author used quota sampling toward the 100 students as the subjects of the study. The data collection used buying interests scale in modern market. Furthermore, the writer used Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI) to understand the types of personality. As for method analyze data used to test difference are technique examination of assisted T­test by using SPSS version 12. 00 for Windows. It might be concluded that there were differences among buying motivation in modern market which is very significantly by (t = 2, 753 ; sig = 0, 007 < 0, 001) in terms of introvert type of personality was higher (x = 94, 63) than the extrovert type of personality (x = 88, 79).
