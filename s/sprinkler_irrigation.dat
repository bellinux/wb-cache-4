25|$|In {{addition}} to providing water for plant growth and development, irrigation systems {{can also be used}} for alternative purposes. One of the most common is the dual application of fertilizer with water in a process known as fertigation. Commonly used in drip irrigation systems, this method allows similarly regulate control over how precisely how much fertilizer and nutrients that each vine receives. Another alternative use for <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems can occur during the threat of winter or spring time frost. When temperature drop below 32°F (0°C), the vine is at risk of developing frost damage that could not only ruin the upcoming years harvest but also kill the vine. One preventive measure against frost damage is to use the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> system to coat the vines with a protective layer of water that freezes into ice. This layer of ice serves as insulation keeping the internal temperature of the vine from dropping below the freezing mark.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{techniques}} for measuring in-situ infiltration {{include the use}} of a single or double ring infiltrometer. Single and double ring infiltrometer only measures flow under ponded (saturated) conditions, and when used in soil with distinct macropores, preferential flow will dominate the flow. (See: Poiseuille's law) This does not reflect infiltration under rainfall or <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Therefore, many authors attempted to create a negative potential (tension) on the water flow. This is to exclude macropores in the flow process, hence only measuring the soil matrix flow.|$|E

25|$|<b>Sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> {{involves}} {{the installation of}} a series of sprinkler units throughout the vineyard, often spaced as several rows about 65 feet (20m) apart. The sprinklers can be set on an electronic timer and release predetermined amount of water for a set period of time. While this provides more control and uses less water than flood irrigation, like furrow irrigation the amount that each individual wine receives can be sporadic. The irrigation system that provides the most control over water management, though conversely the most expensive to install, is drip irrigation. This system involved long plastic water supply lines that run down each row of vines in the vineyard with each individual grape vine having its own individual dripper. With this system, a viticulturist can control the precise amount of water that each grapevine gets down to the drop. An adaption of this system, potentially useful in areas where irrigation may be banned, is underground subirrigation where precise measurements of water is delivered directly to the root system.|$|E

2500|$|In {{some areas}} of the world, {{irrigation}} is necessary to grow any crop at all, in other areas it permits more profitable crops to be grown or enhances crop yield. [...] Various irrigation methods involve different trade-offs between crop yield, water consumption and capital cost of equipment and structures. Irrigation methods such as furrow and overhead <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> are usually less expensive but are also typically less efficient, because much of the water evaporates, runs off or drains below the root zone. [...] Other irrigation methods considered to be more efficient include drip or trickle irrigation, surge irrigation, and some types of sprinkler systems where the sprinklers are operated near ground level. [...] These types of systems, while more expensive, usually offer greater potential to minimize runoff, drainage and evaporation. [...] Any system that is improperly managed can be wasteful, all methods have the potential for high efficiencies under suitable conditions, appropriate irrigation timing and management. [...] Some issues that are often insufficiently considered are salinization of groundwater and contaminant accumulation leading to water quality declines.|$|E

The experimental plots were located in an area on the Northeast corner of the station, known as the Shelby land. The legal description of the area is the south 600 feet of the east ½ of the east ½ of the southeast ¼ of section 16, T 13 N, R 30 W. The soil on the experimental area was a Bridgeport very fine sandy loam. Eight plots, 56 by 500 feet, were used in the experiment. Four plots of Midland milo were irrigated with a portable sprinkler line and four with gated pipe into furrows. All plots except two were separated from the neighboring plots by 30 -foot strips of alfalfa An adequate water supply was available at the plot area. Water was taken from a pipeline which taps the penstock of the Platte Valley Public Power and Irrigation District power plant. A six-inch aluminum pipe line was used to take water from the field riser to the experimental plots. The line was laid along the south ends of the plots. A “T” in the main line near the plots being irrigated allowed water to be delivered to a sprinkler lateral to the gated pipe at the same time. Advisor: Paul E. Schleusene...|$|R
