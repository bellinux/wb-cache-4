Those that would stand still {{of their own}} will were milked {{in the middle of}} the yard, where many of such better behaved ones stood waiting now--all prime milchers, such as were seldom seen out of this valley, and not always within it; nourished by the <b>succulent</b> <b>feed</b> which the water-meads {{supplied}} at this prime season of the year. Those of them that were spotted with white reflected the sunshine in dazzling brilliancy, and the polished brass knobs of their horns glittered with something of military display. Their large-veined udders hung ponderous as sandbags, the teats sticking out like the legs of a gipsy's crock; and as each animal lingered for her turn to arrive the milk oozed forth and fell in drops to the ground.|$|E
40|$|To {{throw some}} light on the subject of succulence for winter {{fattening}} of lambs, with especial reference to the use of corn silage in that capacity, a series of experiments was conducted during three winters, beginning December, 1906. These experiments were planned to indicate the principal results attending the feeding of <b>succulent</b> <b>feed</b> to fattening lambs and to furnish a comparison between the old time special crops for this purpose, and corn silage, the only <b>succulent</b> <b>feed</b> practicable for winter use on an extensive scale. The immediate objects of the work were as follows: 1. To compare a ration of grain and hay for fattening lambs with rations containing <b>succulent</b> <b>feed.</b> 2. To compare sugar beets, mangels, turnips, rutabagas, cabbage, and corn silage as sources of succulence for fattening lambs. 3. To determine whether <b>succulent</b> <b>feed</b> is essential to rapid gains, high condition, and quality of finish...|$|E

40|$|Baboons are dietary generalists, {{consuming}} a {{wide range}} of food items in varying proportions. It is thus difficult to quantify and explain the dietary behavior of these primates. We present stable carbon (d 13 C) and nitrogen (d 15 N) isotopic data, and percentage nitrogen (%N), of feces from chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) living in two savanna environments of South Africa: the mountainous Waterberg region and the low-lying Kruger National Park. Baboons living in the more homogeneous landscapes of the Waterberg consume a more isotopically heterogeneous diet than their counterparts living in Kruger Park. Grasses and other C 4 -based foods comprise between 10 – 20 % (on average) of the bulk diet of Kruger Park baboons. Carbon isotopic data from the Waterberg suggest diets of 30 – 50 % grass, which is higher than generally reported for baboons across the African savanna. Based on observations of <b>succulent</b> <b>feeding,</b> we propose that baboons in the Waterberg consume a mix of C 4 grasses and CAM-photosynthesizing succulents in combined proportions varying between 5 – 75 % (average, 35 %). Fecal d 15 N of baboons is lower than that of sympatric ungulates, which may be due to a combination of low levels of faunivory, foraging on subterranean plant parts, or the use of human foods in the case of Kruger Park populations. Fecal N levels in baboons are consistently higher than those of sympatric ungulate herbivores, indicating that baboons consume a greater proportion of protein-rich foods than do other savanna mammals. These data suggest that chacma baboons adapt their dietary behavior so as to maximize protein intake, regardless of their environment...|$|R
40|$|Use {{of space}} by {{sympatric}} European hares (Lepus europaeus) and European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) {{was investigated in}} a coarse-grained environment in the Mediterranean climatic zone of Australia by telemetric methods. There was {{a high degree of}} overlap between rabbits and hares during the day, when both species made use of native vegetation as cover. At night, hares travelled further than rabbits. Well after both species had become active, the hares still spent time in crop and pasture areas utilised by rabbits, although partial avoidance was detected in the periods around dawn and dusk. Rabbit home ranges were c. 10 ha, but at 149 ha mean hare home range area matched the maximum predicted for a herbivorous species of its size. Home ranges of rabbits, and overlap between male rabbits, decreased as <b>succulent</b> green <b>feed</b> became available.

40|$|Scarcity of feed of a {{succulent}} nature, for milking cows, {{during the}} fall and early winter, suggested to us the growing of soft turnips for that purpose. Our dry, warm climate is not suited for turnips planted in the spring. They mature early and become rank flavored and unpalatable. European farmers grow them successfully, from spring planting, in. moist, cool climates, where the maize plant will not mature, and where the entire summer season is necessary to develop them. Fairly good success from planting them later, and fairly good results from feeding them to dairy cows, induced us to experiment, {{during the summer of}} 1894, with later planting. Iowa farmers have usually sown turnips broadcast, which prevents cultivation. Drouths that are common with us generally evaporate the moisture from the surface soil, and few turnips are gathered. Our people seldom depend on turnips as part of a fall or winter ration for domestic animals, but the growth of dairying requires <b>succulent</b> <b>feed</b> at all seasons, and the soft turnip is valuable for this purpose between summer and winter conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify management practices associated with ostrich farming in Kano, Kaduna and Plateau States of Nigeria. Seven farms were purposively selected as units of analysis. Primary data were generated by means of a pre-tested, semi-structured questionnaire, administered to the sampled respondents. A simple inductive statistics was applied to the primary data. The result reveals a commercial production of ostrich by 86 % with all the farms engaged in production of other livestock species. Similarly, all the farms had shelter for chicks and breeders which were all erected using wire mesh and poles at above 5 feet fencing level. More over, 100 % of the farms were densely stocked (below 500 m 2 for a pair of ostrich) with facilities below recommended levels. The result also showed that 100 % of the farms compound feed locally using premix without no providing grit and low (14 %) usage of <b>succulent</b> <b>feed.</b> About 29 % of the farms use endoparasitic and anthelminthic drugs as health management practices. On the reproductive practices, only trio (29 %) and colony (71 %) configurations were practiced.

40|$|Organic {{farms are}} {{characterized}} as low external input agro-ecosystems. Currently, some organic dairy farmers feed higher amounts of concentrates and <b>succulent</b> <b>feed,</b> {{some of which}} is purchased, to increase the dairy performance of their cows. To assess the environ¬mental impact of this practice, nutrient balances at the farm-gate level of 26 organic dairy farms located in two different regions in Germany were compiled and analysed. The farms are characterised by different production features and feeding intensity levels (0 - 2. 72 t DM of concentrates per cow and year, which was 0 - 378 g kg- 1 milk) yielding 5, 150 - 8, 790 kg milk on average per cow and year. The area- and product- (milk) related farm-gate nutrient budgets for P and K are almost balanced (mean - 3 kg P ha- 1, range (R) : - 14 to 4 kg P ha- 1; - 0. 5 g P kg- 1 milk, R: - 2. 8 to 0. 9 g P kg- 1 milk and 1 kg K ha- 1, R: - 13 to 15 kg K ha- 1; 0. 1 g K kg- 1 milk, R: - 2. 4 to 3. 9 g K kg- 1 milk).

40|$|TypescriptM. A. University of Missouri 1914 It {{is claimed}} that the first silo in the United States was built in Michigan in 1875. However it is only {{recently}} that their use has become general. For a long time they were considered of value only to dairymen but within {{the last few years}} many beef cattle men are feeding silage. In the last year or two there has been an enormous {{increase in the number of}} silos. The Orange Judd Farmer recently made a careful estimate of the silos in the Central Valley States and reported that the number had doubled within the last two years. They reported the total number of silos in use in Missouri on Jan 1, 1914 as 6726, the silos built during 1913 as 2679 and the average capacity as 110 tons. Several advantages of silos are generally recognized. A large % of the food value of the corn plant is in the stalk and blades. By ensiling the whole plant the stalk and blades are saved whereas with the old custom of allowing the stalks to re- main out in the shocks or standing in the field a large part of the food value was leached out. The whole plant is removed from the field as soon as it is mature, leaving the field clear for other crops. Labor can be used to the best advantage in harvesting corn for the silo as the crew can be organized to good advantage and teams and machinery used to advantage. <b>Succulent</b> <b>feed</b> is provided for seasons when it is not naturally obtainable thus supplying a very important element in the ration. The labor of feeding is lessened and made more agreeable by feeding the corn plant in the form of silage. With the increasing use of silage a number of questions have risen regarding it. For example, what is the significance of temperature? High temperatures are observed at the surface of the silage. There is a question whether this temperature prevails throughout the silage, at different depths and different distances from the wall, how the different kinds of silos and different kinds of corn affect it and what relation does it bear to the quality of the silage?
