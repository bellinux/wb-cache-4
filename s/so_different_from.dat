5|$|When {{asked by}} emperor Frederick to {{also join the}} Swabian League, the Eidgenossen flatly refused: they {{saw no reason to}} join an {{alliance}} designed to further Habsburg interests, and they were wary of this new, relatively closely knit and powerful alliance that had arisen on their northern frontier. Furthermore, they resented the strong aristocratic element in the Swabian League, <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> their own organization, which had grown over the last two hundred years liberating themselves from precisely such an aristocratic rule.|$|E
5|$|The coins {{struck by}} Beonna's last known moneyer, Wilred, are <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> Efe's {{that it is}} highly {{unlikely}} that they were produced at the same mint or at the same time. It can also be assumed that Wilred is the same moneyer who struck coins for Offa of Mercia, possibly at Ipswich. Wilred's coins can be used to demonstrate that Offa's influence over the East Angles occurred at an earlier date than has previously been supposed, but are of little use in determining a secure chronology for Beonna's reign. Wilred's name is always depicted in runes. Nearly all his reverse dies have two crosses placed between the elements of his name (+ wil + red): most of the obverse dies show crosses and the king's name in a similar design, but also include an extra rune. This unique rune, similar to ᚹ, possibly meant walda ('ruler').|$|E

25|$|I am {{extremely}} {{disappointed with}} the overall picture of Test play, which {{was not the kind}} of cricket I want to watch. People who pay to see a Test are entitled to see a real match, not a tactical tie-up. I think it is a fair result that neither England or Australia won the series. I can't get out of my head why Test matches are <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> what we visualised. After all this talk of brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|E
25|$|The current {{photonics}} masts have {{a visual}} appearance <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the ordinary periscopes {{that when the}} submarine is detected, it can be distinctly identified as a Virginia-class vessel. As a result, current photonic masts will be replaced with Low-Profile Photonics Masts (LPPM) which resemble traditional submarine periscopes more closely.|$|E
25|$|In December, she {{released}} her Cantonese album Di-Dar which mixes an alternative yodelling style {{with a touch}} of Indian and Middle Eastern flavour. This album was a success, partly because it was <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the mainstream Cantopop music, but—ironically—a couple of very traditional romantic songs topped the charts.|$|E

25|$|As {{with other}} crustaceans, copepods have a larval form. For copepods, the egg hatches into a nauplius form, {{with a head}} and a tail but no true thorax or abdomen. The larva molts several times until it resembles the adult and then, after more molts, {{achieves}} adult development. The nauplius form is <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the adult form that it was {{once thought to be}} a separate species.|$|E
25|$|And finally {{when looking}} at the three most {{primitive}} insects with aquatic nymphs (called naiads: Ephemeroptera, Odonata and Plecoptera), each order has its own kind of tracheal gills that are <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> one another that they must have separate origins. This would be expected if they evolved from land-dwelling species. This means {{that one of the most}} interesting parts of insect evolution is what happened between the Thysanura-Pterygota split and the first flight.|$|E

25|$|Regardless, modern Brazilian Portuguese {{was highly}} {{influenced}} by other languages introduced by immigrants through the past century, specifically by German, Italian and Japanese immigrants. This high intake of immigrants not only caused the incorporation and/or adaptation of many words and expressions from {{their native language}} into local language but also created specific dialects {{as it is the}} case of German's Hunsrückisch dialect in the South of Brazil. This {{is also one of the}} main reasons why Brazilian Portuguese sounds <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> other Portuguese derivatives.|$|E
25|$|The Revolution did {{revolutionize}} social relations. It did {{displace the}} deference, the patronage, the social divisions that had determined {{the way people}} viewed one another for centuries and still view one another {{in much of the}} world. It did give to ordinary people a pride and power, not to say an arrogance, that have continued to shock visitors from less favored lands. It may have left standing a host of inequalities that have troubled us ever since. But it generated the egalitarian view of human society that makes them troubling and makes our world <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the own in which the revolutionists had grown up.|$|E
25|$|Perennial rice are {{varieties}} of long-lived rice that {{are capable of}} regrowing season after season without reseeding; they are being developed by plant geneticists at several institutions. Although these varieties are genetically distinct and will be adapted for different climates and cropping systems, their lifespan is <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> other kinds of rice that they are collectively called perennial rice. Perennial rice—like many other perennial plantscan spread by horizontal stems below or just above the surface of the soil but they also reproduce sexually by producing flowers, pollen and seeds. As with any other grain crop, it is the seeds that are harvested and eaten by humans.|$|E

25|$|Tocqueville's {{penetrating}} analysis {{sought to}} understand the peculiar nature of US political life. In describing the US, he agreed with thinkers such as Aristotle and Montesquieu that the balance of property determined the balance of political power, but his conclusions after that differed radically from those of his predecessors. Tocqueville tried {{to understand why the}} US was <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> Europe in the last throes of aristocracy. The US, in contrast to the aristocratic ethic, was a society where hard work and money-making was the dominant ethic, where the common man enjoyed a level of dignity which was unprecedented, where commoners never deferred to elites, and where what he described as crass individualism and market capitalism had taken root to an extraordinary degree.|$|E
25|$|The 1975 season saw the {{introduction}} of the Astros' new uniforms. Many teams were going away from the traditional uniform and the Astros were no exception. The uniforms had multishade stripes of orange, red and yellow in front and in back behind a large dark blue star over the midsection. The same stripes ran down the pant legs. Players numbers not only appeared {{on the back of the}} jersey, but also on the pant leg. The bright stripes were meant to appear as a fiery trail like a rocket sweeping across the heavens. The uniforms were panned by critics, but the public liked them and versions started appearing at the high school and little league level. The uniform was <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> what other teams wore that the Astros wore it both at home and on the road until 1980.|$|E
25|$|We {{said this}} movie is a stylized movie, it’s not <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the world of a musical. And {{there were a few}} other things that contributed to that direction. One was the {{decision}} on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And just so you know, this is the early ’80s and you had stylized films—like New York, New York—that were all done on set and that idea was in the air. That idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is that we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E

25|$|The Union {{started the}} war with five Regular mounted regiments: the 1st and 2nd U.S. Dragoons, the 1st Mounted Rifles, and the 1st and 2nd Cavalry. These were renumbered the 1st through 5th U.S. Cavalry regiments, respectively, and a 6th was recruited. The Union was {{initially}} reluctant to enlist additional regiments, because of the expense, the understanding that training an effective cavalryman could {{take as long as}} two years, and the conventional wisdom that the rough and forested terrain of the United States, being <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> that of Western Europe, would make the deployment of Napoleonic-style cavalry forces ineffective. As the war progressed, the value of cavalry was eventually realized (primarily for non-offensive missions), and numerous state volunteer cavalry regiments were added to the army. While initially reluctant to form a large cavalry force, the Union eventually fielded some 258 mounted regiments and 170 unattached companies, of differing enlistment periods, throughout the war and suffered 10,596 killed and 26,490 wounded during the struggle.|$|E
25|$|Like most of Burgundy, the {{vineyard}} soils of the Cote de Nuits is extremely varied. Even {{areas on the}} same hillside or only separated by a single dirt path can have dramatically different soil compositions. The Burgundian attribute this diversity of soils to the terroir {{of the region and}} as partial explanation for how a pinot noir wine made near the village of Gevrey-Chambertin can taste <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> a pinot noir made in the adjoining village of Morey-St-Denis. Despite these differences, there are some broad generalizations that can be made. Most vineyards contain a base soil of limestone with marl (a clay and limestone mixture) that often includes a mixture of gravel and sand. Historically Burgundian wine growers would uses the proportion of limestone to marl as a guide for what type of grape varieties would be most suited to the area. If the area had a high concentration of marl, pinot noir was planted while Chardonnay would grow in vineyards dominated by limestone.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the elders}} of the village did not approve and did nothing to help her, Lillinonah nursed the {{stricken}} Englishman through {{all the rest of}} the long, cold winter, seldom leaving his side. As spring came to the encampment of the Pootatucks, he was well along the road to recovery, thanks to the care of his attentive nurse and the good medicine which she had provided. With the blossoming of the mountain laurel on the banks of the Housatonic, love, too, bloomed in the house of Lillinonah. As the beautiful daughter of Waramaug gazed with undisguised affection into the eyes of the man whose life she had saved, she saw that he returned her adoration with unaffected ardor. When summer came, the two young lovers finally decided that they must go to Chief Waramaug, for a love as deep as theirs must be consummated by marriage. The great sachem's reaction, however, was as they both expected: he was very angry. With all the eligible Indian suitors for miles around still beating a path to her door, how dare Lillinonah ask for his blessing on a union with a white man, an unknown stranger whose culture was <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> her own? Was it not true that the paleface despised the Indians, regarding them as little better than the savage beasts of the forest? No, said Waramaug, never would he sanction Lillinonah's marriage to such a man.|$|E
