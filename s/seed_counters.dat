40|$|Abstract—Cryptographic {{primitives}} such as secure hash functions (e. g., SHA 1, SHA 2, and SHA 3) and {{symmetric key}} block ciphers (e. g., AES and TDES) have been {{commonly used to}} design pseudorandom generators with counter modes (e. g., in Java Crypto Library and in NIST SP 800 - 90 A standards). It is assumed that if these primitives are secure then the pseudorandom generators based on these primitives are also secure. However, no systematic research and analysis have been done to support this assumption. Based on complexity theoretic results for pseudorandom sequences, this paper analyzes stochastic properties of long sequences produced by hash function based pseudorandom generators DRBG from NIST SP 800 - 90 A and SHA 1 PRNG from Java Crypto Library. Our results show {{that none of these}} sequences satisfy the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) which holds for polynomial time pseudorandom sequences. Our results also show that if the <b>seeds</b> and <b>counters</b> for pseudorandom generators are not appropriately chosen, then the generated sequences have strongly biased values for LIL-tests and could be distinguished from uniformly chosen sequences with a high probability. Based on these results, appropriate <b>seeding</b> and <b>counter</b> methods are proposed for pseudorandom generator designs. The results in this paper reveal some “non-random” behavior of SHA 1, SHA 2, and of the recently announced SHA 3. I...|$|R

50|$|Eventually, Chis and Soela {{decide to}} show Lewing {{one of the}} classrooms. The find one that is unlocked, and hurry in. Lewin {{immediately}} begins to look around, touching many {{of the items in}} the room, including a bottle of undead seeds. He uncorks the bottle to look inside, but Soela hastily runs in to warn them of a teacher coming their way. As the trio rush out, Lewin places the bottle of undead <b>seeds</b> on the <b>counter.</b> It falls to the ground and shatters, exposing the seeds to oxygen. Due to the fact that oxygen causes the activation of the seeds, skeletons spring out. The skeletons eventually break out of the classroom and invade the campus, causing much panic. The invasion reaches the degree where it is necessary for teacher intervention.|$|R
40|$|Thermodynamic and {{aerodynamic}} measurements at {{and near}} the endwall of turbine vanes were carried out in a linear cascade with a transonic flow field. The investigations were performed in the Windtunnel for Straight Cascades at DLR Göttingen at representative dimensionless engine conditions of Mach and Reynolds number, Ma 2 is = 1. 0 and Re 2 = 850000 respectively. The endwall film cooling configuration consisted of a slot {{in front of the}} vanes, film cooling holes inside the vane passages and a groove simulating the slit between two adjacent vane platforms, but there was no coolant leakage from the groove. Laser-Two-Focus velocimetry (L 2 F) was used to determine local velocities {{in the vicinity of the}} endwall. At a much larger number of locations compared to the velocity measurements the L 2 F-device was utilized as a <b>seeding</b> particle <b>counter</b> which enabled the determination of local coolant concentration. With these concentration measurements the migration of coolant from the different origins could be traced through the vane passage. By extrapolating the measured concentration values to the endwall adiabatic film cooling effectiveness could be obtained. The measurements at the present slot configuration were compared with previous ones where the slot position was closer to the vane entrance. Whereas the coolant ejection at the previous slot position produced a much more intense horse shoe vortex than without coolant, the new slot position causes no increase of secondary flow. This result proves the previous statement that positioning a coolant opening flush near the saddle point of the upstream endwall boundary layer stagnation region should be avoided. The new slot position improved film cooling effectiveness compared to the previous ones even with half the amount of coolant. By investigating the migration of film coolant from the holes inside the vane passage, ineffective holes could be identified and suggestions for improving the film coolant configuration could be given. At one location adiabatic film cooling effectiveness from these aerodynamic measurements could be compared with a thermodynamic measurement using infrared imaging...|$|R
40|$|Disturbances such as fire {{have the}} {{potential}} to remove genetic variation, but <b>seed</b> banks may <b>counter</b> this loss by restoring alleles through a reservoir effect. We used allozyme analysis to characterize genetic change in two populations of the perennial Hypericum cumulicola, an endemic of the fire-prone Florida scrub. We assessed genetic variation before and 1, 2, and 3 years after fire that killed nearly all aboveground plants. Populations increased in size following fire, with most seedlings likely recruited from a persistent seed bank. Four of five loci were variable. Most alleles were present in low frequencies, but our large sample sizes allowed detection of significant trends. Expected heterozygosity increased, and allele presence and allele frequencies showed marked shifts following fire. The post-fire seedling cohort contained new alleles to the study and one new allele to the species. Population differentiation between the two study sites did not change. Our study is the first to directly documents genetic changes following fire, a dominant ecological disturbance worldwide, and {{is also one of the}} few to consider shifts in a naturally recruiting post-disturbance seedling cohort. We demonstrate the potential of seed banks to restore genetic variation lost between disturbances. Our study demonstrates that rapid genetic change can occur with disturbance and that fire can have positive effects on the genetics of rare species...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Researchers {{frequently}} include multiple cultivars {{and fertility}} levels in field experiments. Therefore, the experiments sowing operation must represent a considerable saving {{in time and}} labor, compared to hand sowing. Greater flexibility in experimental design and setup could be achieved by equipment that enables quick changes in the cultivar and fertilizer rates from one plot to the next. A satisfactory seed drill must distribute a given quantity of seed evenly over a predetermined length of coulter row, the coulters must be spaced at exact intervals and depth of sowing must be uniform. In a self-propelled type of plot seeder, no coulter should run in a wheel track as the compaction of the soil can cause observable differences in vigor between plants in such a row and those in un-compacted rows. The machine should sow in succession from a try in which a series of seed pocket separated clearly and must be put into distributer funnel by an assistant operator. The length of gap being varied according to the nature and purpose of the plot. The objectives of this experiment were 1 - to design and construct a local self-propelled plot seeder and 2 - To compare it with the imported (Wintersteiger) plot seeder in cereal breeding programs. Materials and Methods A small-plot seeder was designed and constructed to meet this objective. The unit consists of the following basic components: a toolbar for pulling a set of six blade coulter, an air compressor for lifting and putting down the openers and metering transmission drive wheel, an operators chair and work rack, one belt seed distribution. A cone-celled and rotor seed distributor is used for seed distribution to the openers. The cone system {{is connected to the}} gearbox and allows for great flexibility in changing cultivars, crop species, and plot length. This is driven by the separate drive wheel. The cone-celled distributor sows all the seed of the sample in making one complete turn. The spinner can be equipped with a 4 or 6 outlet delivery head, depending on row spacing. The planter is fitted with hoe openers. Alternatively, spear-point openers have sometimes been used under conventional tillage systems. Seeding depth control was achieved by an adjustment screw handle. The plot seeder is being moved by a 9. 6 kW engine, and has been successfully used in applications. Field experiment established by using 4 plot length (2, 3, 4 and 6) with 4 replication by the constructed plot seeder and imported plot seeder. Crop measurements were planted height, spike m- 2, seeds/spike, Thousand kernel weight, Biological and grain yield, harvest index and drill measurements were seeding depth, uniformity of row spacing in action, <b>seed</b> <b>counter</b> performance, power requirement, slippage evenly of rows after planting. Results and Discussion Results showed that there were significant differences between the plant emergences. The emergencies were higher in plots, which planted by the new plot seeder. The differences between seed distribution of openers were insignificant, but the variances of new plot seeder and imported plot seeder were 0. 267 and 1. 05 respectively. Mean planting depth of plots planted by the Wintersteiger plot seeder was 0. 8 cm shallower than the adjusted planting depth while mean planting depth in plots planted by constructing machine had only 0. 01 cm variation. Results of variance analysis revealed that effect of treatments on wheat grain yield and yield components was significant. So that, highest grain yield (4216 kgha- 1), biological yield (8704 kgha- 1), number of spikes per square meter (649 spike), obtained from a plot which planted by constructed plot seeder. Increasing yield of treatments which planted by constructed plot seeder might be because of increasing the number of spikes per square meter in those treatments. The mean of spike per square meter in plots of new planter was 691 spikes which were 116 spike more than plots planted by imported plot seeder. Conclusions The constructed plot seeder had up to 18500 cost reduction. The seeder was able to distribute the different type of seed to the seed tubes uniformly in laboratory tests, nevertheless it is necessary to test the constructed plot seeder in field condition by using different seed type and conducting new research project. Advantages of this planter include less variation of seed fall down in different coulters, perfect planting depth control, separate wheel for adjusting planting length, minimize the slippage of planter driven wheel and proper utility in different field condition. According to effects on crop parameters the constructed plot seeder had relative priority to imported one. In addition easily accessories supply and cheaper prime cost are profit of the designed and constructed plot seeder...|$|R
40|$|Prediction of {{the role}} of native insect herbivores in the {{population}} growth and spatial distribution of native plants within the environment remains limited. We developed an integral projection model (IPM) to explore the effect of native insect herbivores on the population dynamics and distribution of the native plant Cirsium altissimum (tall thistle), in two different productivity zones in tallgrass prairie in Nebraska USA. Model parameters were extracted from two field experiments: a seed addition experiment that demonstrated seed limitation by insect herbivores on adult recruitment and an insect herbivory exclusion experiment that demonstrated significant herbivore impacts on both rosette performance and adult fecundity. Zones differed in elevation, soil moisture and biomass. Using our model, we asked: (1) does insect herbivory reduce plant population growth rate (λ), (2) does the effect on (λ) differ between productivity zones, (3) does it primarily operate by limiting growth or fecundity and (4) is there evidence for density dependence in mediating impact on (λ) ? We found that insect herbivory suppressed tall thistle population growth rate, but the magnitude of this effect did not vary with ecosystem productivity. Insect herbivores’ effect on k arose primarily through suppression of fecundity. We found no evidence of negative density dependence <b>countering</b> <b>seed</b> limitation effects of insect herbivory on tall thistle population growth. The similar magnitudes of these effects in different productivity zones eliminate variation in ecosystem productivity as a majority condition in determining insect herbivores’ impact in shaping local distribution of this native plant. Overall, the results show that native insect herbivores suppress population growth of this native plant, mediated through seed limitation that functionally determines adult density, without differences related to ecosystem productivity...|$|R
