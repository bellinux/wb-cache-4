To mitigate the leakage/evaporation of organic solvent in liquid electrolytes, a regular-fencing-patterned polymer film has been introduced in between the two electrodes of DSSCs.

40|$|Abstract Si-based antiresonant {{reflecting}} {{optical waveguide}} type B (ARROW-B) surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors allow label-free high-sensitivity detection of biomolecular interactions in real time. The ARROW-B waveguide, {{which has a}} thick guiding layer, provides efficient coupling with a single-mode fiber. The Si-based ARROW-B SPR biosensors were fabricated by using the standard semiconductor fabrication processes with a single-step lithography. A fluid flow system was designed to transport samples or analytes. The waveguide consists of propagation and SPR sensing regions. The propagation regions {{in the front and}} rear of the SPR sensing region have a symmetric cladding structure to isolate them from envi-ronmental changes. A high-index O-ring is used to <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> flow channel. The intensity interrogation method was used to characterize the sensors. The sensitivity of the biosensors was 3. 0 9 103 lW/RIU (refractive index unit) with a resolution of 6. 2 9 10 - 5 RIU. An in situ regener-ation process was designed to make the sensors reusable and eliminate re-alignment of the optical measurement system. The regeneration was realized using ammonia-hydrogen peroxide mixture solutions to remove molecules bound on the sensor surface, such as self-assembled 11 -mercapto- 1 undecanoic acid and bovine serum albumin. SPR was used to monitor the regeneration processes. The experimental results show that the sensing response did not significantly change after the sensor was reused more than 10 times. In situ regenerations of the sensors were achieved...|$|E

Their filling technology was investigated earlier with highly viscous formulations, while hardly any academic research focused on low-viscosity systems. Accordingly, this work addressed the filling of such oils that are splashing during the dosing process.
