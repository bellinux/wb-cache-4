40|$|This paper {{explores the}} work of UK hair <b>stylists</b> in ‘up-market’ {{hairdressing}} salons and examines {{the connection between the}} organisation of work and customer service narratives within these salon environments. Drawing on qualitative empirical research, the paper discusses how tensions, generated through managerial regulation and the concomitant requirement for <b>stylists</b> to exercise task discretion, are ultimately reconciled through customer service narratives. The paper argues that while the narratives achieve this by operating as a form of normative regulation in the salons, whereby the work practices of <b>stylists</b> are shaped in line with organisational goals and objectives, they also function as resources for <b>stylists</b> through which they can further their economic and occupational self-interests...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{little is}} {{actually}} known about hairdressing {{as a specific}} form work. While there are some studies that explore dimensions of gender, ‘race’ and class within hairdressing salons, few studies have focused directly on the work being done by <b>stylists</b> and how this connects to organisational structures, cultures and to the relationships between employers, <b>stylists</b> and their clients. This paper hopes to stimulate further research and discussion in this area by exploring the work of UK <b>stylists</b> in ‘up-market’ hairdressing salons. It examines, in particular, {{the relationships between the}} organisation of work and customer service narratives that operate in these salon environments. Drawing on qualitative empirical research the paper examines how tensions, generated through managerial regulation and the concomitant requirement for <b>stylists</b> to exercise task discretion, are ultimately reconciled through customer service narratives. It discusses how these narratives enable <b>stylists</b> to legitimise their work practices and also maintain positive engagement in diverse, and sometimes contradictory, occupational performances. The paper argues that while the narratives may be seen to operate as a form of normative regulation in the salons they also function as resources for <b>stylists</b> to further their economic and occupational self- interests...|$|R

5|$|Azalea also envisioned an Eastern {{theme for}} the music video because of the song's Eastern music {{influences}} and her interest in Bollywood films.
