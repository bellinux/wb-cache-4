25|$|Traditionally {{it was a}} women's sport, but {{following}} {{the addition of a}} new mixed-pair event, FINA World Aquatics competitions are open to men since the 16th 2015 championships in Kazan, and the other international and national competitions allow male competitors in every event. However, men are currently still barred from competing in the Olympics. Both USA <b>Synchro</b> and <b>Synchro</b> Canada allow men to compete with women. Most European countries also allow men to compete, and France even allows male only podiums, according to the number of participants. In the past decade more men are becoming involved in the sport and a global biannual competition called Men's Cup has been steadily growing.|$|E
25|$|Extra Deck: The player's deck {{which may}} contain up to fifteen cards {{consisting}} of Fusion, <b>Synchro,</b> Xyz, and Link Monster cards. Pendulum Monster cards are placed face up here {{when they would}} be sent from the field to the Graveyard.|$|E
25|$|Hayden Figure Skating Club fields {{currently}} nine {{divisions in}} synchronized skating that compete under sanctioning by USFSA. Each {{of the teams}} appear in various ice shows, exhibitions and other events around the country. The Hayden <b>Synchro</b> Teams are well known not only for their skating, but for their philanthropy.|$|E
50|$|Resolvers produce {{in-phase}} and quadrature components {{which are}} useful for computation. <b>Synchros</b> produce three-phase signals which can be connected to other <b>synchros</b> to rotate them in a generator/motor configuration.|$|R
5000|$|Smaller <b>synchros</b> {{are still}} used to {{remotely}} drive indicator gauges and as rotary position sensors for aircraft control surfaces, where {{the reliability of}} these rugged devices is needed.Digital devices such as the rotary encoder have replaced <b>synchros</b> in most other applications.|$|R
5000|$|Tracto: A blue mini {{tank with}} lasers. Its driver is Tanker. Tracto forms <b>Synchro's</b> boots and Xenon's legs.|$|R
25|$|Jakob is the {{de facto}} leader of the Three Emperors of Yliaster. He is the {{incarnation}} of Aporia's later years, and his despair {{of being one of}} the last four living humans in his time. His ace monster is Meklord Emperor Granel, which can use the power of the <b>Synchro</b> Monsters it absorbs.|$|E
25|$|In the manga, Crow Hogan {{enters the}} D1GP {{in hopes of}} giving his younger brother Yoshi the courage {{to go through a}} serious operation. He is a skilled duelist capable of {{summoning}} two or three <b>Synchro</b> Monsters in a single turn. Crow uses a Blackwing Deck but with new monsters like the Blackwing Tamers. Later on, he gains his own Duel Dragon: Blackfeather Darkrage Dragon.|$|E
25|$|Level / Rank : This is {{indicated}} {{by the number of}} Level Stars shown under the monster card's name. With a normal summon, players can summon one Level 4 or lower monster card to the field. A player can also perform a Tribute Summon, which is necessary to summon monsters that are Level 5 or higher. In a Tribute Summon the player tributes monsters already on the field to the Graveyard. Level 5 and Level 6 monsters require one tribute, while Level 7 and higher monsters require two tributes. Some monsters may require a different number of tributes than their Level would suggest due to card effects. Levels are also important in other ways, such as summoning Ritual or <b>Synchro</b> Monsters. Xyz Monsters do not possess Levels but instead hold Ranks, indicated by black and yellow stars on the left of the card, relevant to the levels of the monsters required to summon it. As such, Xyz Monsters are unaffected by effects which target monsters with Levels and cannot be used for Ritual or <b>Synchro</b> summoning, just like Link Monsters who have neither Ranks nor Levels.|$|E
50|$|Large <b>synchros</b> {{were used}} on naval warships, such as destroyers, {{to operate the}} {{steering}} gear from the wheel on the bridge.|$|R
50|$|The first servomotors were {{developed}} with <b>synchros</b> as their encoders. Much {{work was done}} with these systems {{in the development of}} radar and anti-aircraft artillery during World War II.|$|R
50|$|So called {{multispeed}} <b>synchros</b> have stators {{with many}} poles, {{so that their}} output voltages go through several cycles for one physical revolution. For two-speed systems, these do not require gearing between the shafts.|$|R
25|$|Like his birthmark, his deck {{features}} Monkey monsters, {{including the}} Dark <b>Synchro</b> Monster Zeman the Ape King, which focuses around increasing {{the power of}} his monsters in play through the number of monsters in his graveyard. He is also able to use captured spirits from the Spirit World in order to summon his Earthbound Immortal Cusillu, who can avoid destruction and cut its opponent's life points in half if Devack sacrifices his other monsters in order to do so.|$|E
25|$|Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 4 was {{released}} on September 17, 2009 and is a game for the PSP system, the fourth game in the Tag Force series. The game features the Dark <b>Synchro</b> and Dark Tuner monsters from the 2nd season of the anime. The Promotional Cards are Warm Worm, Worm Bait, and Regret Reborn. This was followed by Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 5, which {{was released}} on September 16, 2010 and set during the third season of the anime. A last game, Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 6 was later released that covered up {{until the end of}} the series.|$|E
25|$|The all-new Skyline was {{introduced}} at reorganized Nissan Japanese dealerships called Nissan Red Stage {{in conjunction with}} the reintroduced Nissan Fairlady Z, sold exclusively at Nissan Blue Stage Japanese dealerships. The vehicle went on sale on June 18, 2001. Early models included the 250GT, 250GTe, and 300GT. Early Skyline Driving Helper model includes 250GT. The Skyline 250GT FOUR sedan includes ATTESSA E-TS all wheel drive with 50:50 <b>synchro</b> mode, VQ25DD (NEO Di) engine, and a five-speed automatic transmission. It went on sale on September 26, 2001. The Skyline 250GTm sedan went on sale on January 13, 2002, while the Skyline 350GT-8 sedan went on sale on February 19, 2002.|$|E
50|$|The {{rotating}} {{deflection yoke}} was an advantage for naval use, where multiple displays were {{provided for the}} same radar set. By using the established technology of <b>synchros</b> and resolvers, stable slaved displays could be provided.|$|R
5000|$|... (The sonar fire-control {{computer}} aboard some destroyers of {{the late}} 1950s required roll and pitch signals for stabilizing, so a coordinate converter containing <b>synchros,</b> resolvers, and servos calculated the latter from gun director bearing, level, and crosslevel.) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Synchros</b> {{designed}} for terrestrial use {{tend to be}} driven at 50 or 60 hertz (the mains frequency in most countries), while those for marine or aeronautical use tend to operate at 400 hertz (the frequency of the on-board electrical generator driven by the engines).|$|R
25|$|Lazar is Goodwin's {{assistant}} and Director of the Neo Domino Security Division. He {{comes from a}} family of clowns and enjoys eating cup ramen. In the third season, he pledges allegiance to the Three Emperors of Yliaster, but later goes into hiding with his wife and son when he learns more about their plans. While generally composed, he gets rather jittery under pressure. He uses a 'Jester Deck', which focuses on sealing <b>Synchro</b> monsters. After his hideout is discovered by Team 5D's, he decides to cooperate with them. After Yliaster is defeated, Lazar becomes the first elected Mayor of New Domino City when a civilian government is established in the city, replacing the Public Security Maintenance Bureau.|$|E
25|$|Rex Goodwin is {{the leader}} of the Yliaster cell working in New Domino City and the Director of Sector Security. He, {{alongside}} his brother Roman, was an assistant to Professor Fudo during the Zero Reverse accident. With his elitism, he transformed the city into a hierarchical society. He shows interest in the Signers, and he explains their significance to Jack prior to holding the Fortune Cup to gather the remaining Signers and awaken their powers. Rex is shown to be aggressive if necessary, but he usually has a calm demeanor. A legendary Turbo Duelist, Goodwin lost his left arm around the time he didn't finish Daedalus Bridge (the only means for the Satellite to be connected with New Domino City) and had it replaced with a cybernetic one which doubles as his duel disk. He additionally possesses his brother's severed arm with the head part of the Mark of the Dragon. In the dub he claims to be the fifth signer, but it is not actually so. But after the deaths of the Dark Signers, Rex reveals himself to have become one of them during a duel with Roman, having the condor birthmark on his back and control of the Earthbound Immortal Wiraqocha Rasca. Furthermore, he integrates his brother's arm onto himself to gain the power of a Signer as part of his plan to use both the Earthbound Immortals and the Crimson Dragon to recreate the world in his image. He is defeated by the joint efforts of Yusei, Jack and Crow, and passes onto the afterlife with Roman. His ace is the <b>Synchro</b> Monster Sun Dragon Inti and the Dark <b>Synchro</b> Monster Moon Dragon Quilla.|$|E
25|$|The story {{focuses around}} {{characters}} playing a card game called Duel Monsters. This series introduces <b>Synchro</b> Monsters in the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game. A new method of dueling with motorcycle-like vehicles called Duel Runners are used, and the duelists engage in games called Turbo Duels. The show {{is set in}} the distant future, where the upper class population live in New Domino City and the lower class in a remote island where Domino's sewage is transported, Satellite. Yusei Fudo, the 18-year-old protagonist, lives in Satellite and makes it his objective to reach his rival Jack Atlas, who lives in Domino. The series focuses on the five Signers, people embodied with a mark of one of the legendary Five Dragons, their conflict with the Dark Signers, and the Three Emperors of Yilaster.|$|E
5000|$|Servos in the {{computer}} boosted torque accurately to minimize loading on the outputs of computing mechanisms, thereby reducing errors, and also positioned the large <b>synchros</b> that transmitted gun orders (bearing and elevation, sight lead angles, and time fuze setting).These were electromechanical [...] "bang-bang", yet had excellent performance.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{they did}} not {{accomplish}} any computation, electromechanical position servos were essential in mechanical analog computers of the [...] "rotating-shaft" [...] type for providing operating torque to the inputs of subsequent computing mechanisms, as well as driving output data-transmission devices such as large torque-transmitter <b>synchros</b> in naval computers.|$|R
5000|$|Vitor: A red {{fighter jet}} armed with lasers, missiles, and a rig to {{restrain}} monsters. Its pilot is Amp, and later Lucky. On one occasion it was piloted by Sydney, who had trouble flying it. Vitor forms <b>Synchro's</b> helmet and body armor; and Xenon's head, arms, and chest.|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} {{categories}} of monster cards, which are color-coded and vary in the methods {{by which they}} are summoned. Generally, the monsters with more difficult summoning methods will have higher ATK points and better card effects. Normal and Effect monsters can be Normal Summoned, Tribute Summoned, or Special Summoned by card effects. All other types of cards need to be Special Summoned by fulfilling the summoning requirements detailed below. Fusion, <b>Synchro,</b> Xyz and Link Monsters are stored in an Extra Deck separate from the Main Deck (where destroyed Pendulum Monsters are also placed). These cards may be resummoned from the graveyard provided they were successfully summoned beforehand, though if they are returned to the Extra Deck, the player will need to fulfill the summoning requirements once more to summon them again.|$|E
25|$|Like Rex, Roman has a bionic arm, {{which he}} uses to trigger explosives. He is {{defeated}} by Yusei, but before he dies, he triggers an explosion that sends Yusei down into the pool Ener-D. His deck focuses around Spider type monsters, and specializes in changing an opponent's monster into defense mode to obtain counters for summoning his Earthbound Immortal Uru. Uru can control an opponent's monster by sacrificing one of his own. Roman is later defeated by Yusei, but he sets off an explosive in his mechanical arm before crumbling to dust, so that Yusei would fall into {{the gate to the}} Netherworld. His spirit remains in the world until Goodwin is defeated, at which point Roman joins his brother in the afterlife. His ace is the Dark <b>Synchro</b> Underground Arachnid.|$|E
25|$|Roman is {{the leader}} of the Dark Signers. He {{possesses}} a birthmark resembling the Spider Nazca line and can use it send out spiders that can possess civilians, turning them into Dark Signers, and giving them Shadow powers and Dark Tuner and <b>Synchro</b> Monsters. The spiders can also be used as a means of surveillance, reporting all they have found once they return to their owner. Roman reveals himself to be Rex Goodwin's big brother and an assistant to Professor Fudo (Yusei's Father), until he met a mysterious man from Yliaster. The man told him to look into Ener-D's light and learn about the Earthbound Immortals' battle against the Crimson Dragon. Though revealed to be the Fifth Signer, Roman betrays Professor Fudo and causes the Zero Reverse incident after ripping his own arm off and giving it to Rex, telling him to unite the Signers. The resulting explosion transforms Roman into a Dark Signer.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The paper {{presents}} an analytic method capable {{to evaluate the}} transmission errors between two <b>synchros.</b> The method is validated by experimental tests. The system created in this way allows the determination of small errors, like seconds in the transmission of the angular position between a transmitter selsyn and a receiver selsyn. Index Terms — analytic method, selsyn, transmission error...|$|R
50|$|Fire-control {{system designs}} {{developed}} during World War II used <b>synchros</b> extensively, to transmit angular information from guns and sights to an analog fire control computer, and to transmit the desired gun position {{back to the}} gun location. Early systems just moved indicator dials, but {{with the advent of}} the amplidyne, as well as motor-driven high-powered hydraulic servos, the fire control system could directly control the positions of heavy guns.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} uses {{a hydraulic}} clutch, {{except for the}} Cobra which was mechanical. The Cobra had an 11-inch clutch disc. The entire case, including the bell housing, is made of aluminum. The T-56 has a synchromesh made up of brass <b>synchros</b> for the GM and Ford applications, and stainless steel in the Dodge application. The transmission also features internal stops which render stopbolts on the shifter mechanism unnecessary.|$|R
25|$|There {{are also}} Dark Signer-like figures (called Shadow Drones in the dub) who are {{recruited}} {{and controlled by}} Roman's spiders. They only have access to Dark Tuner and Dark <b>Synchro</b> Monsters. When these Shadow Drones are defeated, their Mark of the Shadows and Deck disappear, and they lose their memories of being possessed. According to Goodwin, a true Dark Signer cannot be returned to normal, because they have already died. In addition, their duels end with the losing duelist being killed (in the dub, the loser {{is sent to the}} Netherworld). When a true Dark Signer is defeated, all the souls that were used for summoning their Earthbound Immortal are freed (this also seems to apply to non-Dark Signers who were defeated in Shadow Duels). After Goodwin and the King of the Netherworld are defeated, Goodwin and Roman pass on to the afterlife while Carly, Misty, and Devack are revived with no memory of their time as Dark Signers. Kalin is later shown to still remember his time as a Dark Signer, as well as Greiger. It is speculated that they kept their memories because, unlike the others, they willingly became Dark Signers.|$|E
25|$|Aporia is an android {{from the}} future, {{one of the}} last {{remaining}} humans after the Ener-D explosion. On the verge of death, Aporia allowed Z-ONE split him into three incarnations, in order to go back into past and alter it. The three incarnations, known as the Three Emperors of Yliaster, are also known as the three tragedies of Aporia's lifetime, because they are the embodiments of intregral moments of his despair. During the end of the WRGP, the Three Emperors combined back into Aporia, who appears in the peak of his life. Aporia duels against Yusei and loses, with his body being damaged as a result. He is repaired by Z-ONE and duels Jack, Leo and Luna {{in order to protect the}} Ark Cradle. He is defeated by them, and they show him that hope is stronger than despair. As a result, Aporia becomes filled with hope and decides to face Z-ONE in a duel. Aporia loses and is destroyed as a result. His Turbo Deck is a composite of the Emperors' Meklord Emperor decks, which have the ability to absorb <b>Synchro</b> Monsters, along with the strongest Meklord Emperor, Meklord Astro Mekanikle. His Standing Deck focuses on effect damage, and features Meklord Armies, and his key monster, Meklord Astro Dragon Asterisk.|$|E
25|$|The Range Rover used {{permanent}} four-wheel drive, {{rather than}} the switchable rear-wheel/four-wheel drive on Land Rover Series vehicles, and had a lever for switching ratios on the transfer box for off-road use. Originally, the only gearbox available was a four-speed manual unit, until Fairey overdrive became an option after 1977. A three-speed Chrysler TorqueFlite automatic gearbox became an option in 1982, which was upgraded to a 4-speed ZF box in 1985, coupled to an LT230 transfer box. The other major transmission upgrade in the Range Rover's lifetime was the switch from the LT95 combined four-speed manual gearbox and transfer box to the LT77 five-speed gearbox and separate LT230 transfer box in 1983. The LT230 was later used on both the Defender and Discovery models, but was replaced on the Range Rover by a Borg Warner chain-driven transfer box incorporating an automatic viscous coupling limited slip differential - earlier transmissions had a manual differential lock (operated by a vacuum servo on the LT95 and mechanically on the LT230). The LT77 had two major design changes: first an upgrade to larger bearings for the layshaft and new ratios around 1988, then a newly designed <b>synchro</b> hub for third and fourth gear and double synchros for first and second. This {{is also known as}} the suffix H gearbox or LT77s.|$|E
50|$|GL-5 is not {{necessarily}} backward-compatible in synchro-mesh transmissions which are designed for a GL-4 oil: GL-5 has a lower coefficient of friction due to the higher concentration of EP additives over GL-4, and thus <b>synchros</b> can not engage as effectively. Also, transmissions which explicitly call for GL-4 oil may have been designed around this lower concentration of EP additives and thus may contain yellow metal parts which GL-5 will corrode.|$|R
50|$|In {{brushless}} <b>synchros,</b> typical rotary transformers (in pairs) provide {{longer life}} than slip rings. These rotary transformers have a cylindrical, {{rather than a}} disc-shaped, air gap between windings. The rotor winding is a spool-shaped ferromagnetic core, with the winding placed like thread on a spool. The flanges are the pole pieces. The stator winding is a ferromagnetic cylinder with the winding inside, and end poles that are discs with holes, like washers.|$|R
5000|$|Borr: An {{orange and}} black tank with twin drills that can fly or burrow underground. Its driver is Sydney. Also, a famous {{basketball}} player—Charles [...] "High Jump" [...] Johnson—was dragged along {{to fight a}} Mega-Virus monster as a temporary driver for Borr when the band used the vehicles to escape the locked high school (in the episode [...] "Syber-Dunk"). Borr forms <b>Synchro's</b> gauntlets and shoulder armor; and Xenon's torso and upper legs.|$|R
