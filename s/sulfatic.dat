It seems that the algae provides it with enough oxygen to survive. The lichen was grown in <b>Sulfatic</b> Mars Regolith Simulant - igneous rock with composition similar to Mars meteorites, consisting of gabbro and olivine, to which quartz and anhydrous iron oxide hematite (the only thermodynamically stable iron oxide under present day Mars conditions) were added. It also contains gypsum and geothite, and was crushed to simulate the martian regolith. This was an ice free environment. They found that photosynthetic activity was strongly correlated with {{the beginning and the}} end of the simulated Martian day. Those are times when atmospheric water vapour could condense on the soil and be absorbed by it, and could probably also form cold brines with the salts in the simulated martian regolith. The pressure used for the experiment was 700 - 800 Pa, above the triple point of pure water at 600 Pa and consistent with the conditions measured by Curiosity in Gale crater.|$|E

This task {{was concerned with}} developing methods to quantitate and identify major sulfur forms in coal based on direct measurement (as opposed to present techniques based on indirect measurement and difference values). The focus was on the forms that were least understood and for which the {{analytical methods}} have been the poorest, i. e., organic and elemental sulfur. Improved measurement techniques for <b>sulfatic</b> and pyritic sulfur {{also need to be}} developed. A secondary goal was to understand the interconversion of sulfur forms in coal during thermal processing. This task had as its focus the development of selective extraction methods that will allow the direct measurement of sulfur content in each form. Therefore, selective extraction methods were needed for the major sulfur forms in coal, including elemental, pyritic, <b>sulfatic,</b> and organic sulfur. This study was a continuation of that of previous analytical method development for sulfur forms in coal which resulted in the successful isolation and quantitation of elemental and <b>sulfatic</b> sulfur. Super- and subcritical extractions with methanol or water with and without additives were investigated in an attempt to develop methods for pyritic and organic sulfur forms analysis in coal.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of pertechnetate (TcO 4 -) into feldspathoids produced by alkaline alteration of aluminosilicate clays may offer a potential treatment route for 99 Tc containing groundwater and liquors. Kaolinite was aged in NaOH {{to determine the}} effect of base concentration, temperature, and solution composition on mineral transformation and pertechnetate uptake. In all reactions, increased temperature and NaOH concentration increased the rate of kaolinite transformation to feldspathoid phases. In reactions containing only NaOH, sodalite was the dominant alteration product however, small amounts (6 - 15 %) of cancrinite also formed. In experiments containing NaOH/Cl and NaOH/NO 3 mixtures, sodalite and nitrate cancrinite were crystallised (at 70 oC), with no reaction intermediates. The addition of SO 42 - crystallised <b>sulfatic</b> sodalite at 40 & 50 oC, but at higher temperatures (60 and 70 oC) <b>sulfatic</b> sodalite transforms to vishnevite (<b>sulfatic</b> cancrinite). In experiments where a pertechnetate tracer was added (at ~ 1. 5 μmols L- 1), only 3 - 5 % of the 99 Tc was incorporated to the feldspathoid phases. This suggests that the larger pertechnetate anion was unable to compete as favourably for the internal vacancies with the smaller OH-, NO 3 -, SO 42 - or Cl- anions in solution, making this method likely to be unsuitable for groundwater treatment...|$|E

The bottom of the cavity is filled with an Early Cretaceous complex of black continental deposits (Albian or perhaps Aptian and Albian-Wealden facies) which are also mineralized. The presence of paleochannels and barren intervals in the baritic lens indicates that mineral concentration was contemporaneous with sedimentation in the paleodolina.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} an introductory chapter (1) and three following chapters (2, 3, and 4) which focus on problems concerning H 2 S (sourgas) encountered in the Basal Zechstein (Upper Permian) of northwest Germany. ^ Chapter 2 introduces a model of gas souring during migration, {{an alternative to the}} commonly reported model of in-place-souring after the gases have accumulated within deep-buried carbonate reservoirs. ^ H 2 S concentrations of more than 5 % in deep carbonate gas reservoirs generally are attributed to thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR). The Zechstein 2 Carbonate reservoir in NW Germany bears gas fields with H 2 S concentrations ranging from 0 % to 40 %. The reservoir is underlain by up to 400 m of sulfate of the Werra Anhydrite. ^ Chapter 3 concentrates on an ancient sulfate depositional system in the Upper Permian Einstein 1 Cycle (Z 1), the Werra Anhydrite, underlying the carbonate reservoir from which the sourgases are produced. It acts as a conduit for the migrating gases within the petroleum system of the Germanic Basin. ^ Well cores of seven wells from the Southern Zechstein Basin were examined for their structural and textural features. Facies interpretation was based on cut core material and thin sections. ^ Four main facies types, (I) supratidal, (II) intertidal, (III) shallow subtidal, and (IV) deeper marine, are further subdivided into 10 subfacies types: (1) karst and (2) sabkha within the supratidal, (3) algal tidal-flat, (4) tidal flat and (5) transgressive deposit within the intertidal main facies type, (6) salina, and (7) <b>sulfatic</b> arenites within the shallow subtidal environment. Subfacies types of the (8) slope commonly associated with (9) turbidites and the (10) basin subfacies type subdivide the deeper marine depositional environment. ^ Vertical stacking patterns of these facies and subfacies, types reveal the sequence stratigraphic development of the <b>sulfatic</b> system in response to sea-level fluctuations. ^ Most of the A 1 succession is represented by three relatively thick parasequences belonging to the highstand systems tract that shows typical prograding sets. ^ Chapter 4 focuses on pyrites as indicators of BSR and TSR in the Basal Zechstein. ^ The Werra Anhydrite (A 1), the sulfate member of the Zechstein 1 Cycle, yields a complex record of diagenetic alteration. Two generations of pyrite reflecting two episodes of sulfate reduction can be reported from the A 1 : (1) an early pulse of sulfate reduction which led to precipitation of framboidal aggregates of pyrite, up to 70 μm in diameter, during eogenetic diagenesis; and (2) a later prismatic generation of pyrite which commonly replaces secondary anhydrite, with individual pentagon-dodecahedrons up to 40 μm in diameter, it also occurs as thin overgrowth (a few microns) on the older framboidal pyrite. ^ These two generations of pyrite also we found within the overlying carbonate member of the Zechstein 2 Cycle. A third type of blocky-prismatic pyrite comprising aggregates of up to cm-length is found exclusively within the Zechstein 2 Carbonate (Ca 2). (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this program is to {{gain an understanding of}} the corrosion chemistry and materials behavior in high temperature environments. Of particular interest are the mechanisms of attack in environments containing more than one reactive species, for example sulfur and oxygen. Sulfur is a critical impurity in almost all energy sources and leads to accelerated, and often unacceptable rates of metal degradation. In addition, the competitive formation of potentially more than one phase as a reaction product is an important fundamental problem, and can only be truly understood if the underlying thermodynamic and transport properties of the systems, and their interrelation, are identified. Sulfur can appear in a number of forms. In entirely gaseous environments it can appear as H{sub Z}S when the oxidizing potential of the atmosphere is low, such as might exist in energy conversion systems, or as SO{sub 2 }/SO{sub 3 } at higher oxygen potentials, such as those produced by fuel combustion. It may also appear in <b>sulfatic</b> deposits, either as a solid, such as CaSO{sub 4 } in fluidized bed combustion systems, as inorganic and organic sulfur compounds in coal char, or as a liquid alkali-metal sulfate in coal-ash, or turbine-blade deposits.

Transition {{often leads to}} changes in soil-forming processes, whereby the environment never comes to equilibrium and therefore the soil chemistry and mineralogy show different influences. Such an environment was analysed in the Saloum River basin, west-central Senegal. The objective was to identify the main pedogenic processes prevailing in this saline and acid pedoenvironment and to assess the influence of environmental factors (climate, topography, soil salinity and acidity) on local soil formation and mineral distribution. The terrace landscape is built up by a floodplain, a low terrace, which is still influenced by groundwater, and a middle terrace. The results show that soil properties are strongly influenced by hydrology, salinity and acidity in the entire toposequence: Gleyic Hyposalic and Hypersalic Solonchaks (<b>Sulfatic)</b> in the floodplain, Haplic Gleysols (Thionic) in the low terrace, and Endogleyic Arenosols in the middle terrace.

Determination {{of the true}} chemical forms of sulfur in coal is necessary to develop more effective methods to reduce sulfur content. Past work at the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) indicates that sulfur chemistry has broad implications in combustion, gasification, pyrolysis, liquefaction, and coal-cleaning processes. Current analytical methods are inadequate for accurately measuring sulfur forms in coal. This task was concerned with developing methods to quantitate and identify major sulfur forms in coal based on direct measurement (as opposed to present techniques based on indirect measurement and difference values).

40|$|Sodalite-group {{minerals}} (sodalite, tugtupite and danalite subgroups) commonly {{occur in}} alkaline igneous rocks, {{and in some}} hydrothermal and metamorphic rocks. These minerals present a zeolite-like cubic structure and two structural cavities per unit cell. Cationic and anionic contents of SSG are of interest {{for the study of}} magmatic systems; in particular, their volatile components can be useful because they can provide key information on the genetic environment, like degassing dynamics, fluids behaviour during hydrothermal processes and so on [1 - 4]. Besides, SSG are very promising in different fields of material science, since their (ultra) microporous structures show high flexibility and versatility in hosting tetrahedral cations and variable channels/cavities components. Hence, they can be suitable as advanced materials and behave as models for many technological and commercial applications [5, 6], for instance separation processing (i. e. hydrogen from gaseous macromolecules). The present study is focused on crystal-chemical characterization of cationic and anionic components of SSG occurring in various igneous to metamorphic rocks and ejecta from the alkaline-potassic Somma-Vesuvius volcano (southern Italy), as revealed by using combined microbeam techniques, i. e., EPMA, SIMS and μ-FTIR. Previous studies on sodalite-group minerals by means of EPMA, Raman, and LA-ICP-MS techniques focussed on halogen- (Cl, Br) and S-contents [2, 3, 8]. To the authors’ knowledge no studies on volatiles in SSG have been performed so far by integrated SIMS-FTIR investigations. Compared to bulk analyses, SIMS and μ-FTIR methods are particularly pivotal to probe trace to ultra-trace contents, speciations and orientations of an absorber across the samples [1, 7].

40|$|Biofilm {{formation}} {{represents a}} successful survival strategy for bacteria. In biofilms, cells {{are embedded in}} a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). As they are often more stress-tolerant than single cells, biofilm cells might survive the conditions present in space and on Mars. To investigate this topic, the bacterium Deinococcus geothermalis was chosen as a model organism due to its tolerance toward desiccation and radiation. Biofilms cultivated on membranes and, for comparison, planktonically grown cells deposited on membranes were air-dried and exposed to individual stressors that included prolonged desiccation, extreme temperatures, vacuum, simulated martian atmosphere, and UV irradiation, and they were exposed to combinations of stressors that simulate space (desiccation + vacuum + UV) or martian (desiccation + Mars atmosphere + UV) conditions. The effect of <b>sulfatic</b> Mars regolith simulant on cell viability during stress was investigated separately. The EPS produced by the biofilm cells contained mainly polysaccharides and proteins. To detect viable but nonculturable (VBNC) cells, cultivation-independent viability indicators (membrane integrity, ATP, 16 S rRNA) were determined in addition to colony counts. Desiccation for 2 months resulted in a decrease of culturability with minor changes of membrane integrity in biofilm cells and major loss of membrane integrity in planktonic bacteria. Temperatures between - 25 °C and + 60 °C, vacuum, and Mars atmosphere affected neither culturability nor membrane integrity in both phenotypes. Monochromatic (254 nm; ‡ 1 kJ m⁻²) and polychromatic (200 – 400 nm; > 5. 5 MJ m⁻² for planktonic cells and > 270 MJ m⁻² for biofilms) UV irradiation significantly reduced the culturability of D. geothermalis but did not affect cultivation-independent viability markers, indicating the induction of a VBNC state in UV-irradiated cells. In conclusion, a substantial proportion of the D. geothermalis population remained viable under all stress conditions tested, {{and in most cases}} the biofilm form proved advantageous for surviving space and Mars-like conditions...|$|E

In order to prepare the analyses of the returned samples, ground-based simulations were carried out in Planetary and Space Simulation facilities. During the ground-based simulations, Chroococcidiopsis cells mixed with two Martian mineral analogues (phyllosilicatic and <b>sulfatic</b> Mars regolith simulants) were exposed to a Martian simulated atmosphere combined or not with UV irradiation corresponding to the dose received during a 1 -year-exposure in low Earth orbit (or half a Martian year on Mars). Cell survival and preservation of potential biomarkers such as photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments or DNA were assessed by colony forming ability assays, confocal laser scanning microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and PCR-based assays. DNA and photoprotective pigments (carotenoids) were detectable after simulations of the space mission (570 MJ/m(2) of UV 200 - 400 nm irradiation and Martian simulated atmosphere), even though signals were attenuated by the treatment. The fluorescence signal from photosynthetic pigments was differently preserved after UV irradiation, depending on {{the thickness of the}} samples. UV irradiation caused a high background fluorescence of the Martian mineral analogues, as revealed by Raman spectroscopy. Further investigation will be needed to ensure unambiguous identification and operations of future Mars missions. However, a 3 -month exposure to a Martian simulated atmosphere showed no significant damaging effect on the tested cyanobacterial biosignatures, pointing out the relevance of the latter for future investigations after the EXPOSE-R 2 mission.

Although the rock and soil of the Gusev Crater plains are dominated by Fe(2 +) in olivine-bearing basalt (approx. Fo 60), a Fe(3 +) -rich component (nanophase ferric oxide, np-Ox) has significant abundance in surface soils (13 - 28 % of total Fe) and in the surface coatings (rinds) of certain rocks (39 %) but not in rock interiors exposed by grinding (5 - 6 %). The mode of occurrence of np-Ox implies {{that it is the}} product of oxidative alteration of Fe(2 +) silicate and oxide phases in the presence of H 2 O. The ubiquitous presence of sulfur in soil and in rock coatings, as determined by the MER-A APXS instrument, suggests that the alteration occurred under acid-sulfate conditions, so that both hydrolytic and <b>sulfatic</b> reactions are viable. A possible source for the weathering agents is volcanic emanations rich in H 2 O and SO 2. Generally, rocks in the Columbia Hills are significantly more altered than those in the Gusev plains, with a higher proportion of Fe(3 +) oxide phases compared to Fe(2 +) silicate phases. This mineralogical dichotomy implies a difference in the timing, rate, duration, and/or mechanism of alteration for basaltic material in the Gusev plains compared to basaltic material in the Columbia Hills. It is possible, for example, that the basaltic material in the Columbia Hills underwent aqueous alteration in a paleoclimate that favored nearly complete alteration and that the basaltic material of the Gusev plains will not achieve the degree of alteration exhibited by the Columbia Hills under current martian surface conditions...|$|E

Further analyses will help us to correlate these results with survival potential, cellular damages or stability and the different extremophiles tested in the BIOMEX experiment...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Raman spectra will be {{measured}} with the Raman Laser Spectrometer (RLS) onboard ExoMars in 2018 to identify organic compounds and mineral products {{as an indication}} of former or recent biological activi-ty. Investigation with the same specifications as those onboard the ExoMars mission is conducted to test the potential of identifying biological material on martian analogue material with Raman spectroscopy. Appropriate parameters concerning integration time and number of repititions for the detection of biological matter {{as well as for the}} determination of the mineral composition will be derived. In addition, problems are reported on using Raman spectroscopy to discriminate the microorganisms from the mineral background. Biological sample Cyanobacteria and methane producing archaea are chosen to represent potential life on Mars. Prokaryotes like archaea and bacteria appeared on early Earth at least 3. 8 to 3. 5 billion years ago (Gya). Life might have developed under similar conditions on Mars as on Earth or might have been transferred from Earth (or vice versa). At that time on Mars the climate was more temperate and wet compared to the present day as inferred from geological evidence for liquid water on the ancient martian surface. Methane is known to be present on Mars. A source is still unknown. Methane might originate from geothermal or biological activities nearby the surface of the red planet. Cyanobacteria and prokaryotes using photosystem I use pigments such as scytonemin and beta-carotene as UV protection. Especially beta - carotene emits a strong Raman signal at the applied laser excitation wavelength. Raman measurements are used for detection of coccid, chain, and biofilm forming cyanobacteria Nostoc commune strain 231 - 06 (Fraunhofer IMBT CCCryo) on the below described Mars analogue mineral mixtures. Nostoc commune is known to be resistant to desiccation, UV B radiation and low temperatures, and thus suitable as a candidate for a potential life form on Mars. Furthermore, the Raman technique is applied on samples of the methane producing archaea candidatus Methanosarcina gelisolum (strain SMA 21) isolated from Siberian permafrost affected soils and on these archaea embedded in the martian analogue material. Martian analogue material In this investigation two different Mars analogue materials prepared from mineral and rock mixtures are used. The (1) Phyllosilicatic Mars Regolith Simulant (P-MRS) and (2) <b>Sulfatic</b> Mars Reg-olith Simulant (S-MRS) reflect the current understanding regarding environmental changes on Mars. Weathering or hydrothermal alteration of crustal rocks and of secondary mineralization during part of the Noachian and Hesperian epoch followed by the prevailing cold and dry oxidising condition with formation of anhydrous iron oxides. The use of two different mixtures accounts for the observations that phyllosilicatic deposits do not occur together with sulphatic deposits. P-MRS and S-MRS serve as the analogue geomaterials in which the cells of cyanobacteria and of methanogenes are embedded. Results Varying periods of measurement time and number of repetitions are used to get optimal Raman spectra for cyanobacteria and methanogenes. If cyanobacteria are present, beta-carotene is the dominant feature in the spectrum. Measurement times need to be adjusted to obtain optimal spectra of the P-MRS and S-MRS with cyanobacteria. Measurements performed with various values of measurement time and number of measurements show clearly the improvement achieved by increasing the time per spectrum from 1 s to 20 s. But it is desirable to find a set of small values of measurement time and number of repetitions in order to optimize the detection of minerals and biological markers and to reduce the disturbing effect of cosmic rays. A measurement regime is proposed for mineral mixtures with cyanobacteria on the basis of the RLS instrument characteristics: A procedure on ExoMars should start with a measurement time of only a few seconds to identify both biomarkers and minerals. If no biomarkers can be identified the time and number of measurements need to be increased until spectra of minerals are obtained. The measurement time should be selected between 1 s (for b-carotene) and 20 s (for minerals) for a laser power of 1 mW (spot diameter < 2 µm). Future investigations of Raman measurement parameters should consider the different environmental parameters on Mars like atmospheric pressure, composition and temperature. For methanogens a different measurement regime needs to be developed. Raman analytics are capable to identify biosignatures like beta – carotene on a multi-mineral mixture similar to those expected to be encountered during the ExoMars mission. ...|$|E
