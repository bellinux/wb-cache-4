5|$|Busch biographer Joseph Kraus divided {{his work}} into three periods. He points out, however, that this {{classification}} is a <b>simplification,</b> as some works by their nature {{can be of}} a later or earlier period. All three periods show Busch's obsession with German middle class life. His peasants are devoid of sensitivity and village life {{is marked by a}} vivid lack of sentiment.|$|E
5000|$|Gerd Faltings {{subsequently}} {{provided some}} <b>simplifications</b> to the 1995 proof, primarily in switching from geometric constructions to rather simpler algebraic ones. [...] The {{book of the}} Cornell conference also contained <b>simplifications</b> to the original proof.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} bachelor's degree {{project is}} to analyze {{problems}} of computer <b>simplifications</b> of algebraic expressions {{and to create a}} program capable of performing such <b>simplifications</b> not involving human supervision. The first part provides a detailed analysis of expressions and their <b>simplifications</b> as well and objectives of such <b>simplifications.</b> It suggests and describes a formal language of expressions and presents a description of this formal language semantics. The second part of the project provides specific computer representation implementation of the language and a program capable of simplifying algebraic expressions. It contains a description of classes and algorithms used, examination of possibilities and explanation of suggested solutions...|$|R
5|$|In {{chemical}} fields, such as crystallography, space {{groups and}} point groups describe molecular symmetries and crystal symmetries. These symmetries underlie {{the chemical and}} physical behavior of these systems, and group theory enables <b>simplification</b> of quantum mechanical analysis of these properties. For example, group theory is used to show that optical transitions between certain quantum levels cannot occur {{simply because of the}} symmetry of the states involved.|$|E
5|$|Once again, {{this is a}} <b>simplification.</b> Periodic {{motions of}} the Moon and {{apparent}} periodic motions of the Sun (actually of Earth in its orbit) cause short-term small-amplitude periodic oscillations of Earth's axis, and hence the celestial equator, known as nutation.|$|E
5|$|The Maschinenpistole 40 ("Machine pistol 40") {{descended from}} its {{predecessor}} the MP 38, {{which was in}} turn based on the MP 36, a prototype made of machined steel. The MP 36 was developed independently by Erma Werke's Berthold Geipel with funding from the German Army. It took design elements from Heinrich Vollmer's VPM 1930 and EMP. Vollmer then worked on Berthold Geipel's MP 36 and in 1938 submitted a prototype to answer a request from the Heereswaffenamt (Army Weapons Office) for a new submachine gun, which was adopted as MP 38. The MP 38 was a <b>simplification</b> of the MP 36, and the MP 40 was a further <b>simplification</b> of the MP 38, with certain cost-saving alterations, most notably in the more extensive use of stamped steel rather than machined parts.|$|E
30|$|Studies on optimal stand {{management}} {{often make}} <b>simplifications</b> or restrict {{the choice of}} treatments. Examples of <b>simplifications</b> are neglecting natural regeneration that appears on a plantation site, omitting advance regeneration in simulations, or restricting thinning treatments to low thinning (thinning from below).|$|R

This complexity evaluation is based on the case where none of the aforementioned practical <b>simplifications</b> above in Subsection (3.3) are applied. Employing these <b>simplifications</b> reduces the complexity of the practical implementation by a factor of O (QM^ 2), where the first two foregoing <b>simplifications</b> each reduce the complexity by a factor O(M) and the third one by a factor O(Q).|$|R

5|$|Again, {{this is a}} <b>simplification,</b> {{based on}} a {{hypothetical}} Earth that orbits at uniform speed around the Sun. The actual speed with which Earth orbits the Sun varies slightly during the year, so {{the speed with which}} the Sun seems to move along the ecliptic also varies. For example, the Sun is north of the celestial equator for about 185 days of each year, and south of it for about 180 days. The variation of orbital speed accounts for part of the equation of time.|$|E
5|$|As {{the most}} {{successful}} early adaptation of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Sullivan's play influenced subsequent versions. Later adaptations followed his <b>simplification</b> of the narrative, addition of women characters (especially a romance for Jekyll) and highlighting of the moral contrast between Jekyll and Hyde. Most versions retain the practice of having one actor play Jekyll and Hyde, with the transformation seen by the audience. Several early film versions relied more on Sullivan's play than Stevenson's novella.|$|E
5|$|Due to cost increases, several {{features}} of the subway were cut back soon after construction started. Notably, the 72nd Street Station was truncated from a three-track, two-platform design to a two-track, single island platform design, paired with a <b>simplification</b> of the connection to the Broadway Line spur. This design change was done before the actual construction started. The MTA also pushed back its completion date to 2014. In its 2008 capital improvement budget proposal, the MTA further postponed completion of Phase 1 to 2015, and in 2009, the MTA rescheduled it again to 2016.|$|E

5|$|In 1857, Cayley {{introduced}} matrix notation, {{which allows}} for a harmonization and <b>simplification</b> of linear maps. Around the same time, Grassmann studied the barycentric calculus initiated by Möbius. He envisaged sets of abstract objects endowed with operations. In his work, the concepts of linear independence and dimension, as well as scalar products, are present. In fact, Grassmann's 1844 work exceeds the framework of vector spaces, since his consideration of multiplication led him to what are today called algebras. Peano {{was the first to}} give the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps in 1888.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Holden won {{the design}} {{competition}} for an extension to the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Subsequently {{dedicated to the}} memory of King Edward VII (died 1910), the extension (1911–12) was built on steeply sloping ground for which Holden designed a linked pair of Portland stone-faced blocks around a courtyard. The plain, abstract blocks have towers on the corners and two-storey loggias, and are a further <b>simplification</b> of Holden's style.|$|E
5|$|In 3174, the Albertian Order of St. Leibowitz {{is still}} {{preserving}} the half-understood knowledge {{from before the}} Flame Deluge and the subsequent Age of <b>Simplification.</b> The new Dark Age is ending, however, and a new Renaissance is beginning. Thon Taddeo Pfardentrott, a highly regarded secular scholar, is sent by his cousin Hannegan, Mayor of Texarkana, to the abbey.

40|$|The {{interrelation}} between sensitivity, non-linearity and scale, {{associated with}} the inverse problem of identifying permeability from measurements of fluid flow, is considered. The gouverning equations for fluid flow in a porous media is presented, and a measure of sensitivity and non-linearity is derived. By making some <b>simplifications,</b> this measure can be analyzed for different flow structures. The effects of the <b>simplifications</b> are then investigated separately. Finaly some numerical experiments are conducted. They highlight both {{the effects of the}} <b>simplifications,</b> and if the interrelation between sensitivity and scale carry over to a 2 -D setting...|$|R
5|$|In a 2008 {{evaluation}} of state Governors' fiscal policies, the libertarian Cato Institute praised Huntsman's conservative tax policies, ranking {{him in a}} tie for fifth place on overall fiscal policy. He was particularly lauded for his efforts to cut taxes, where he received {{the highest score on}} tax policy of all 50 governors. The report specifically highlighted his reductions of the sales tax and <b>simplification</b> of the tax code.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company's {{operations}} along the coast {{can be seen by}} their 1870 schedule, in which they were making the journey to Kiama, Shoalhaven and Gerringong every three days, and to Ulladulla, Clyde, Shoalhaven and Wollongong at about the same rate. Mourya was visited every two weeks, while an additional journey was made to Merimbula and Ulladulla once a week. 1873 saw a <b>simplification</b> of these services, and a weekly run to Merimbula, Eden and Tathra was amongst the changes.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} the process came with {{proposals}} released in 1995 by the Honours Advisory Committee that reviewed the honours system. Until May 1996, New Zealand made recommendations for various British awards for acts of gallantry performed during military operations and acts of bravery by civilians including the Victoria Cross and George Cross. However, the British Government's review and <b>simplification</b> of their awards system provided an ideal opportunity for New Zealand to also develop a unique and simplified system.|$|E

30|$|Some <b>simplifications</b> {{to rivet}} {{geometry}} is proposed in Skorupa et al. (2015) to apply Neuber fatigue notch factors to open hole and filled hole subjected to remote tension, pin loading and out-of-plane bending.

5|$|Type I systems {{sometimes}} {{include a}} third component. In {{the case of}} the well-characterised hok/sok system, in addition to the hok toxin and sok antitoxin, there is a third gene, called mok. This open reading frame almost entirely overlaps that of the toxin, and the translation of the toxin is dependent on the translation of this third component. Thus the binding of antitoxin to toxin is sometimes a <b>simplification,</b> and the antitoxin in fact binds a third RNA, which then affects toxin translation.|$|E
5|$|As a whole, {{interest}} in the war memorials diminished considerably in the 1950s and 1960s, reflected in a reduced level of ceremonies and a <b>simplification</b> of the commemorative events around memorials. In the post-war years, for example, the separate official and veterans ceremonies at the Verdun memorials blended into one; in 1956, German and French ceremonies were also united into a single event. Attendance at events like Anzac Day diminished. Many memorials slowly deteriorated: {{in some cases the}} original inter-war funding had never included maintenance, in other cases the materials used to construct the memorials were not durable. In some towns and cities, the memorials were moved to less prominent locations as part of urban renewal projects, or hidden by new buildings. World War I memorials were commonplace in many countries and were paid little attention.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Frank Oliver, who had {{represented}} Edmonton in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories since 1888, {{resigned to}} pursue a career in federal politics. Several Strathcona residents urged Rutherford to run for Oliver's old seat in the ensuing by-election. Though he was originally reluctant, he agreed to stand after a 300-signature petition urging his candidacy was presented to him. His only opponent was former Edmonton mayor Matthew McCauley who, like Rutherford, ran as an independent. Rutherford campaigned on a platform of improved roads, resource development, <b>simplification</b> of territorial ordinances, and—in what would become a theme of his political career—increased educational funding. McCauley won the election, but Rutherford received more than forty percent of the vote.|$|E
