40|$|This study {{examines}} the long-term effectiveness of multimedia advertising {{in a competitive}} setting {{and its implications for}} budget allocation decisions, using multivariate persistence methodology. Analysis of network TV, <b>spot</b> <b>TV,</b> and magazine advertising for the two major competitors in the U. S. SUV industry suggested that long-run advertising effectiveness differed considerably among media. These differences were attributed to the media lifespan, retrieval, and content of the message they convey. The authors propose that budget allocation decisions should consider the long-run effectiveness of the different media employed to increase the productivity of advertising campaigns. They also conduct a simulation experiment to further investigate long-run sales effects of alternative allocation strategy scenarios. ...|$|E

500|$|In August 2012, the viral {{advertising}} site [...] "Dredd Report" [...] was launched, satirising the Drudge Report. The site featured a video condemning {{the use of}} Slo-Mo, and links to news about the film. A tie-in comic book was published; its plot serves as a prequel to the film's narrative and follows Ma-Ma's life as a prostitute, controlled by her pimp Lester Grimes. Ma-Ma forms a relationship with Eric—the creator of Slo-Mo. Lester kills Eric for interfering with his business, Ma-Ma castrates Lester with her teeth in retaliation and Ma-Ma takes over the Slo-Mo operation. The comic was written by Judge Dredd Megazine editor Matt Smith, drawn by 2000 AD artist Henry Flint and was released on 5 September 2012. An exclusive film poster featuring artwork by Jock was released by Mondo to promote the film's appearance at the 2012 Fantastic Fest in September 2012. Dredds marketing campaign won a Golden Trailer Award for Best Thriller <b>TV</b> <b>Spot</b> for the trailer [...] "Big Addicted", and received nominations for: Best Action <b>TV</b> <b>Spot,</b> Most Original <b>TV</b> <b>Spot,</b> Best Graphics in a <b>TV</b> <b>Spot,</b> Best Music <b>TV</b> <b>Spot,</b> and Best Action Poster and Most Original Poster for the Dredd motion poster.
