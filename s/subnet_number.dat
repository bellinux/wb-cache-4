50|$|At Hacking at Random, the pegs were {{distributed}} {{according to the}} network map of the event terrain. Every field had a distinct subnet and per subnet, there was a division between regular IP address distribution via DHCP and the (fixed) IP addresses, distributed via Peg DHCP. To obtain an IP address via Peg DHCP, one had to note the <b>subnet</b> <b>number</b> on their field's Datenklo (dedicated rain-proof box for networking equipment, usually an empty, portable toilet). With this <b>subnet</b> <b>number,</b> the correct, routable, IP address could be handed out.|$|E
40|$|This memo {{provides}} {{information for the}} Internet community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. The IP architecture assumes that each Data Link subnetwork is labeled with a single IP <b>subnet</b> <b>number.</b> A pair of hosts with the same <b>subnet</b> <b>number</b> communicate directly (with no routers); a pair of hosts with different subnet numbers always communicate through one or more routers. As indicated in RFC 1620, these assumptions may be too restrictive for large data networks, and specifically for networks based on switched virtual circuit (SVC) based technologies (e. g. ATM, Frame Relay, X. 25), as these assumptions impose constraints on communication among hosts and routers through a network. The restrictions may preclude full utilization of the capabilities provided by the underlying SVC-based Data Link subnetwork. Thi...|$|E

Bridging multiple links into a single entity has several operational advantages. A single subnet prefix is sufficient to support multiple physical links.

40|$|This memo {{suggests}} a new procedure for assigning <b>subnet</b> <b>numbers.</b> Use of this assignment technique within a network {{would be a}} purely local matter, and would not effect other networks. Therefore, {{the use of these}} procedures is entirely discretionary. This memo provides information for the Internet community. It does not specify an Internet standard. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Overview RFC- 950 [2] specifies a procedure for subnetting Internet addresses using a bit-mask. While RFC- 950 allows the "ones " in the subnet mask to be non-contiguous, RFC- 950 recommends that 1) they be contiguous, and 2) that they occupy the most significant bits of the "host " part of the internet address. RFC- 950 did not specify whether different subnets of the same network may have different masks. This ambiguity was unfortunate, as i...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of Hierarchical Timed Petri Net (HTPN) {{in our system}} modelling tool yields a hierarchical analysis method, namely a Hierarchical Reachability State Diagram (HRSD). A Reachability State Diagram (RSD) can be generated for each <b>subnet,</b> and the <b>number</b> of tokens in each H-Block are also record in the state markings. Since the intention of using a HTPN hierarchical representation is to distribute the complexity of a single net over a set of subnets, the HRSD generated for each subnet may also contribute to solving the state explosion problem when representing the system state transitions in a single diagram. An algorithm is outlined to link these HRSDs of the subnets to model the state transitions of the overall system so that the state changes from one H-Block or subnet to another can be linked. Further state search can be performed to locate the sets of states which hold a similar properties to form a group of composition states corresponding to {{the states in the}} Sta [...] ...|$|R
30|$|This HIP-based micro-mobility {{management}} solution {{reduces the}} HOL and signaling overheads by allowing an MN {{to use the}} same IP address (to avoid the DAD process as it remains within a single domain) and sending the MN's HIT and assigned network prefix to the other S-RVSs (e.g., S-RVS 2) at an appropriate time. Then, the new S-RVS sends both the same network prefix to the MN to retain the same IP configuration, and the UPDATE packet 1 to the LRVS to set up a new path for the ongoing traffic. The use of the same IP address supports the location privacy. Furthermore, the use of HIT in the upper layer protocol instead of IP address enables HIP host to use the established HIP associations during and after the handover, since the communication context remains the same. Moreover, reducing the time taken to perform HIP BE can also reduce the handover delay when the re-establishment of HIP SA is required. Having S-RVS also eliminates the need for a new location reachability check between the MN and its peer, because the new location of the MN is known to the serving S-RVS. The number of S-RVSs in a domain depends on the domain's size, and each subnet is managed by an S-RVS which acts as the authoritative S-RVS for that <b>subnet.</b> The <b>number</b> of MNs in each subnet must not exceed the capability of the S-RVS. This method can also manage simultaneous move of communicating parties (i.e., when the communicating parties move at the same time) and multihoming in an easy and efficient manner.|$|R
40|$|Human {{actions can}} be {{represented}} by the trajectories of skeleton joints. Traditional methods generally model the spatial structure and temporal dynamics of human skeleton with hand-crafted features and recognize human actions by well-designed classifiers. In this paper, considering that re-current neural network (RNN) can model the long-term con-textual information of temporal sequences well, we propose an end-to-end hierarchical RNN for skeleton based action recognition. Instead of taking the whole skeleton as the in-put, we divide the human skeleton into five parts accord-ing to human physical structure, and then separately feed them to five <b>subnets.</b> As the <b>number</b> of layers increases, the representations extracted by the subnets are hierarchically fused to be the inputs of higher layers. The final represen-tations of the skeleton sequences are fed into a single-layer perceptron, and the temporally accumulated output of the perceptron is the final decision. We compare with five other deep RNN architectures derived from our model to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed network, and also com-pare with several other methods on three publicly available datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance with high compu-tational efficiency. 1...|$|R
30|$|This work is {{continuation}} of our earlier {{work in this}} area (Afzaal and Zafar 2016 a, b, c). In this paper, an algorithm is proposed which assumes that sensors and actors are deployed in the form of subnets in the areas which are more affected by the earthquakes. The subnet-based deployment makes the model more energy efficient as the problem becomes localized in a subnet. A <b>subnet</b> employs large <b>number</b> of sensors and a less number of actors with a specified gateway node. The subnets are connected through gateway nodes which are connected with a base station for disseminating the information. The proposed model is a combination of centralized and distributed approach. The approach is centralized as the whole information of a subnet is transmitted towards the gateway node which issues order to an actor to perform an action. The centralized approach is more suitable in static environment but it increases computational cost in terms of energy and time. In the distributed approach, the control is distributed among sensors and actors for sensing and performing the actions. The distributed approach is useful in a dynamic and unpredictable environment however it is not efficient as it may have a lack of complete information. In the proposed model, sensors are used to predict the earthquakes and actors are used to take measures to minimize the damages. The gateway node is assumed to communicate earthquake information to other gateway nodes and to decide about the required actions by the actors in a subnet.|$|R
