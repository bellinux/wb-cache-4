A generic knot K in the complement of L has neither fiber quadrisecants nor fiber extreme <b>secants</b> such that K touches the corresponding half-plane at 2 points. Both types of <b>secants</b> occur in generic isotopies of knots. We give lower bounds {{for the number of}} these fiber <b>secants</b> in all isotopies connecting given isotopic knots. The bounds are expressed in terms of invariants calculable in linear time with respect to the number of crossings. 1...|$|R

The explicit formulae show that the sum of two points P and Q with rational coordinates has again rational coordinates, since the line joining P and Q has rational coefficients. This way, one shows that the set of rational points of E forms a subgroup of the group of real points of E. As this group, it is an abelian group, that is, P + Q = Q + P.|$|E
25|$|In 1859, the pyramidologist John Taylor claimed that, in the Great Pyramid of Giza, {{the golden}} ratio is {{represented}} by the ratio of the length of the face (the slope height), inclined at an angle θ to the ground, to half the length of the side of the square base, equivalent to the <b>secant</b> of the angle θ. The above two lengths were about 186.4 and 115.2 meters respectively. The ratio of these lengths is the golden ratio, accurate to more digits than either of the original measurements. Similarly, Howard Vyse, according to Matila Ghyka, reported the great pyramid height 148.2 m, and half-base 116.4 m, yielding 1.6189 for the ratio of slant height to half-base, again more accurate than the data variability.|$|E
