5|$|There {{are several}} {{examples}} of academic, peer-reviewed research concerning {{different aspects of}} Magic: The Gathering. One example examined how players use their imaginations when playing. This research studied hobby players and showed how players sought to create and participate in an epic fantasy narrative. Another example used online auctions for Magic cards to test revenue outcomes for various auction types. A final example uses probability to examine Magic card-collecting strategies. Using a specific <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>cards</b> in a specialized manner has shown Magic: The Gathering to be Turing complete.|$|E
25|$|Resource cards {{can also}} be spent to buy a {{development}} card. Three types of development cards include cards worth one victory point; knight cards (or soldier cards), which allow the player to move the robber {{as if they had}} rolled a 7 (but without the remove-half rule); and a third <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>cards</b> which allow the player one of three abilities when played.|$|E
25|$|In 1895, British sinologist William Henry Wilkinson wrote a paper which {{mentioned}} a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>cards</b> known in central China {{by the name}} of ma chioh, literally, hemp sparrow, which he maintained was the origin of the term Mahjong. He did not explain the dialect of the originator or region specific etymology of this information. By 1910, there were written accounts in many languages, including French and Japanese.|$|E

25|$|In the 1930s, at Duke University in North Carolina, J. B. Rhine and {{his wife}} Louisa E. Rhine {{conducted}} investigation into extrasensory perception. While Louisa Rhine concentrated on collecting accounts of spontaneous cases, J. B. Rhine worked largely in the laboratory, carefully defining terms such as ESP and psi and designing experiments to test them. A simple <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>cards</b> was developed, originally called Zener cards – now called ESP cards. They bear the symbols circle, square, wavy lines, cross, and star; there are five cards of each in a pack of 25.|$|E
25|$|In Chain of Memories, Marluxia lures Sora to Castle Oblivion so Naminé can {{manipulate}} Sora's memories {{as part of}} his plan to take over the Organization, giving Sora a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>cards</b> allowing him to proceed through the castle. Marluxia assigns Axel to eliminate Vexen to prevent him from revealing the conspiracy to Sora. After kidnapping Naminé in the aftermath of Larxene's death, Marluxia is confronted by Axel, who attempts to kill Marluxia for conspiring against the Organization. However, Marluxia uses Naminé to have Sora fight Axel for him. After Axel's defeat, Marluxia orders Naminé to erase Sora's memories so he can rebuild Sora into his pawn, but she refuses. Marluxia engages Sora using an illusion of himself, but Sora finds the real Marluxia fused to a massive cloaked Nobody and defeats him. Marluxia makes a minor appearance in 358/2 Days, training Roxas before he leaves for Castle Oblivion.|$|E
25|$|Hearthstone is a digital-only {{collectible}} {{card game}} that revolves around turn-based matches between two opponents (player vs. player or player vs. computer opponent) using pre-made decks of cards from their collection. In matches, players use their card deck, representing summonable minions, spells, and other actions, {{along with their}} selected Hero's unique power, to try to defeat their opponent by reducing their health to zero before the opponent {{can do the same}} to them. Players can choose from a number of game modes, with each offering a slightly different experience. Players start the free-to-play game with a limited collection of basic cards but can gain rarer and more powerful cards through purchasing packs of cards through micropayments or as rewards from specific game modes. Blizzard has added new cards sets through Expansions and Adventures, roughly three times a year, to increase the pool of available cards. To help newer players remain competitive with experienced ones while also keeping the metagame dynamic, Blizzard has implemented two different styles of gameplay; Standard which uses only the basic <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>cards</b> plus those of the most recent expansions, and Wild, which allows any cards to be used.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the more}} notable {{contemporary}} sets is the award winning The Key to the Kingdom, a semi-transformation deck commissioned by London's V Museum of Childhood and created by Tony Meeuwissen. [...] It won the WH Smith Literary Award for best illustration and The Designers and Art Directory Association of London gold award. [...] This <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>cards</b> was created around the theme of nursery rhymes and poems. [...] The cards were sold with a book containing each poem {{and a picture of}} the corresponding card on the opposite page. Additionally, the deck was constructed as a puzzle contest laid out {{in the form of an}} original poem. [...] The poem gave clues to pick certain cards, which then could be decrypted into a secret message. The prize of $10,000 and a golden key was won by Susan Kavanagh of Essex.|$|E
2500|$|The Chapmans {{investigated}} {{the source of}} the testers' false confidence. In one experiment, students read through a stack of cards, each with a Rorschach blot, a sign and a pair of [...] "conditions" [...] (which might include homosexuality). The information on the cards was fictional, although subjects were told it came from case studies of real patients. The students reported that the five invalid signs were associated with homosexuality, even though the cards had been constructed so there was no association at all. The Chapmans repeated this experiment with another <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>cards,</b> in which the association was negative; the five signs were never reported by homosexuals. The students still reported seeing a strong positive correlation. These experiments showed that the testers' prejudices could result in them [...] "seeing" [...] non-existent relationships in the data. The Chapmans called this phenomenon [...] "illusory correlation" [...] and it has since been demonstrated in many other contexts.|$|E
2500|$|The cards have typical {{suits for}} Northern European cards of the period: flowers, birds, deer, beasts of prey and wild men - so five suits in total. Each symbol (or [...] "pip") on a card is different, so the {{quantity}} and difficulty of the engraving is far greater than found in a modern <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>cards</b> (and, equally, rapid play {{must have been very}} difficult as there are no numbers depicted on the cards). Engraved sets of cards are few; they must have been much more expensive than those made in woodcut, which can be printed in much greater numbers before the matrix wears out. Interestingly and unusually, some of the cards are composed of different little plates, one per pip, which were presumably held together in a frame for printing. [...] Possibly the Master was in Mainz and was influenced by Johannes Gutenberg's movable type. Despite this, the majority of the pips are unique, and although they appear rather jumbled as groups, when looked at individually it is apparent that many are very fine studies of their subjects. Despite the very few impressions surviving, some cards exist in two states, and some in different versions, all catalogued by Max Lehrs.|$|E

2500|$|The card catalogs {{presented}} {{a problem of}} greater complexity. The 1876 card catalog begun by Brevoort recorded {{a part of the}} accessions received after 1866. There was one <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>cards</b> {{for the use of the}} public, and another duplicate set for official use. This was at first mainly a subject or rather a broadly grouped classed catalog. The cards were about 5 inches long by [...] high. For author entries reliance was made upon the interleaved copies of the Cogswell printed catalog and upon a set of author cards — by no means a complete record — for public use. In 1880 when work began upon the new printed catalog this card catalog was closed; its author cards were destroyed when the new catalog was issued, but revision of the subject group continued as occasion offered until after the 1895 consolidation. After 1880, three card catalogs continued until the 1895 consolidation: (1) an official “Bulletin,” on large cards, for works acquired after 1880, mainly an author arrangement; (2) the public “small card” catalog, a dictionary catalog of authors and subjects; (3) the official “small card” catalog, likewise a dictionary arrangement of authors and subjects, but written on thinner cards. [...] The public catalog was severely criticized in the public press for various idiosyncrasies, example articles being “A Library's Buried Treasures” in The New York Times of June 8, 1881, and in September 1881 a critical letter submitted to the Boston Transcript over the signature of “Delta.” The second article was reprinted in the Library Journal of September–October 1881 (pp.259–261, with editorial comment on pp.255–256).|$|E

It was only myself--Jaquetta never saw {{anything}} but kindness, and took it pleasantly, and Fulk was too busy and too unhappy {{to be concerned about}} our visiting matters. If I saw anyone coming to call I hid myself in the orchard, or if I was taken by surprise I was stiffness itself; and then I wrote a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>cards</b> (Miss Torwood and Miss Jaquetta Torwood), and drove round in the queer old-fashioned gig to leave them, and there was an end of it; for I would accept no invitations, though Jaquetta looked at me wistfully. And thus I daunted all but old Miss Prior. Poor old thing! All her pleasures had oozed down from our house in old times to her; and her gratitude was indomitable, and stood all imaginable rebuffs that courtesy permitted me. I believe she only pitied and loved me the more, and persevered in the dreadful kindness that has no tact.|$|E
