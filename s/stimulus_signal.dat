50|$|Before the {{audience}} arrives, random or pseudo-random noise {{is used as}} a <b>stimulus</b> <b>signal,</b> usually pink noise. Such noise signals provide equal energy at each octave of the audio frequency range that the sound system can reproduce, unlike a <b>stimulus</b> <b>signal</b> of music or speech which emphasizes some frequencies over others. Once {{the audience}} enters the performance venue, the main output of the mixing console is substituted as the <b>stimulus</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
50|$|These early analyzers {{could only}} {{determine}} {{total harmonic distortion}} and noise combined, and worked by employing a steep notch filter to remove the fundamental frequency of the <b>stimulus</b> <b>signal</b> from {{the output of the}} DUT.

The same nonlinear system will produce both THD (with a solitary sine wave input) and IMD (with more complex tones).

40|$|Pigeons {{were trained}} on a trial {{procedure}} in a Skinner box. Each trial {{began with a}} fixed-interval schedule. Responding on this schedule produced a stimulus and a delayed trial outcome. The <b>stimulus</b> <b>signalled</b> whether the forthcoming outcome was reinforcement or nonreinforcement. Thus, the response was an observing response. When reinforcement was the outcome on 20 % of the trials, response rates in the fixed interval were higher than when reinforcement was the outcome on 80 % of the trials. This result {{is consistent with the}} hypothesis that observing responses are reinforced by the information associated with the <b>stimulus</b> <b>signalling</b> reinforcement.

50|$|Ca2+ {{has many}} {{important}} roles as an intracellular messenger. The {{release of a}} large amount of free Ca2+ can trigger a fertilized egg to develop, skeletal muscle cells to contract, secretion by secretory cells and interactions with Ca2+ -responsive proteins like calmodulin. To maintain low concentrations of free Ca2+ in the cytosol, cells use membrane pumps like calcium ATPase found in the membranes of sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle. These pumps are needed to provide the steep electrochemical gradient that allows Ca2+ to rush into the cytosol when a <b>stimulus</b> <b>signal</b> opens the Ca2+ channels in the membrane. The pumps are also necessary to actively pump the Ca2+ back out of the cytoplasm and return the cell to its pre-signal state.|$|E

The main {{research}} issue of this project is the mechanism of predictive modeling in audition. Specifically, Schröger investigates how automatic predictions about upcoming auditory events can be generated {{on the basis of}} regular environmental stimulation. Due to this mechanism, for example, incoming acoustic stimuli can be processed with astonishing speed as when comprehending spoken language or localizing moving sounds. Likewise, the specific processing of self-induced auditory stimuli—stimuli that a person creates by means of its own behavior—can be explained by the principles of predictive modeling. In order to optimize a predictive model, the information processing system calculates predictive errors as the difference between the prediction and the actual <b>stimulus</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E

When the stimuli remained on {{for the duration of}} the components and signalled differential reinforcement magnitudes, observing responses were maintained; however, when the stimuli remained on for 10 sec, observing responses decreased markedly. In addition, it was shown that the occasional presentation of the <b>stimulus</b> <b>signalling</b> 10 -sec access to grain was necessary for the maintenance of observing behavior. A control condition demonstrated that when all the available <b>stimuli</b> <b>signalled</b> 6 -sec access to grain, observing responses declined.

When the heart of his first clinical success ceased to beat because its native <b>stimulus</b> <b>signal</b> failed, Zoll saved the man by substituting a sequence of chest shocks produced by an experimental pacemaker borrowed from Otto Krayer of the Harvard Medical School Department of Physiology. The next year he collaborated with Alan Belgard, the chief electrical engineer and co-owner of the Electrodyne Company, to develop an efficient chest surface pacemaker to conform to Paul's needs. That collaboration became long term as together they developed production model chest surface pacemakers, clinical alarmed heart rhythm monitors, chest surface defibrillators, cardiac monitor- automatic pacemakers, and long term implantable self-contained pacemakers.|$|E
50|$|The action {{potential}} or the spike does not itself carry any information. It is {{the stream of}} spikes, called spike train, that carry the information in its number and pattern of spikes and timing of spikes. The postsynaptic potential can be either positive, the excitatory synapse or negative, inhibitory synapse. In modeling, the postsynaptic potentials received by the dendrites in the postsynaptic neuron are integrated and when the integrated potential exceeds the resting potential, the neuron fires an {{action potential}} along its axon. This model is the Integrate-and-Fire (IF) model that was mentioned in Section 2.3. Closely related to IF model is a model called Spike Response Model (SRM) (Gerstner, W. (1995) Pages 738-758) that is dependent on impulse function response convoluted with the input <b>stimulus</b> <b>signal.</b> This forms a base for {{a large number of}} models developed for spiking neural networks.|$|E
50|$|Loudspeakers {{differ from}} most other items of audio {{equipment}} in suffering from 'colouration'. This {{refers to the}} tendency of {{various parts of the}} speaker: the cone, its surround, the cabinet, the enclosed space, to carry on moving when the signal ceases. All forms of resonance cause this, by storing energy, and resonances with high Q factor are especially audible. Much of the work that has gone into improving speakers {{in recent years has been}} about reducing colouration, and Fast Fourier Transform, or FFT, measuring equipment was introduced in order to measure the delayed output from speakers and display it as a time vs. frequency waterfall plot or spectrogram plot. Initially analysis was performed using impulse response testing, but this 'spike' suffers from having very low energy content if the stimulus is to remain within the peak ability of the speaker. Later equipment uses correlation on other stimulus such as a Maximum length sequence analyser or MLSSA. Using multiple sine wave tones as a <b>stimulus</b> <b>signal</b> and analyzing the resultant output, Spectral Contamination testing provides a measure of a loudspeakers 'self-noise' distortion component. This 'picket fence' type of signal can be optimized for any frequency range, and the results correlate exceptionally well with sound quality listening tests.|$|E
40|$|Pigeons made observing {{responses}} for <b>stimuli</b> <b>signalling</b> either a fixed-interval 30 -sec schedule or a fixed-ratio x schedule, where x was either 20, 30, 100, 140, or 200 and the schedules alternated at random after reinforcement. If observing responses did not occur, food-producing responses occurred to a stimulus common to both reinforcement schedules. When the fixed-interval schedule was {{paired with a}} low-value fixed ratio, i. e., 20 or 30, {{the presentation of the}} <b>stimulus</b> reliably <b>signalling</b> the fixed-ratio schedule reinforced observing behavior, but the presentation of the <b>stimulus</b> reliably <b>signalling</b> the fixed-interval schedule did not. The converse was the case when the fixed-interval schedule was paired with a large-valued fixed ratio, i. e., 100, 140, or 200. The results demonstrated that the occasional presentation of the <b>stimulus</b> <b>signalling</b> the shorter interreinforcement interval was necessary for the maintenance of observing behavior. The reinforcement relationship was a function of the schedule context and was reversed by changing the context. Taken together, the results show that the establishment and measurement of conditioned reinforcement is dependent upon the context or environment in which stimuli reliably correlated with differential events occur...|$|R
40|$|Six male albino rats {{were placed}} in running wheels and exposed to a fixed-interval 30 -s {{schedule}} of lever pressing that produced either a drop of sucrose solution or the opportunity to run for a fixed duration as reinforcers. Each reinforcer type was signaled by a different stimulus. In Experiment 1, the duration of running was held constant at 15 s while the concentration of sucrose solution was varied across values of 0, 2. 5. 5, 10, and 15 %. As concentration decreased, postreinforcement pause duration increased and local rates decreased {{in the presence of}} the <b>stimulus</b> <b>signaling</b> sucrose. Consequently, the difference between responding in the presence of <b>stimuli</b> <b>signaling</b> wheel-running and sucrose reinforcers diminished, and at 2. 5 %, response functions for the two reinforcers were similar. In Experiment 2, the concentration of sucrose solution was held constant at 15 % while the duration of the opportunity to run was first varied across values of 15, 45, and 90 s then subsequently across values of 5, 10, and 15 s. As run duration increased, postreinforcement pause duration {{in the presence of the}} wheel-running stimulus increased and local rates increased then decreased. In summary, inhibitory aftereffects of previous reinforcers occurred when both sucrose concentration and run duration varied; changes in responding were attributable to changes in the excitatory value of the <b>stimuli</b> <b>signaling</b> the two reinforcers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract − The paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to ADC histogram test by exponential <b>stimulus</b> <b>signal.</b> The basic, early published, method based on simple exponential stimulus can hide some low code frequency errors in ADC integral nonlinearity. This effect is caused by estimation method of exponential stimulus. The authors proposed new advanced method in processing of histograms achieved by exponential <b>stimulus</b> <b>signal.</b> The basic idea of the new method is in application of periodical exponential <b>stimulus</b> <b>signal</b> consisting of rising and falling parts within its period. Subsequently the estimation of INL is done by minimising of cost function given by the difference between INLs calculated for rising and falling part of signal. Performed simulations and experimental results show that the suggested method is usable in real measurement and it is not more complex in comparison with basic exponential stimulus test method both in hardware realisation and in data processing algorithm...|$|E

40|$|International audienceShear stress, hormones like {{parathyroid}} {{and mineral}} elements like calcium mediate the amplitude of <b>stimulus</b> <b>signal</b> which affects {{the rate of}} bone remodeling. The current study investigates the theoretical effects of different metabolic doses in <b>stimulus</b> <b>signal</b> level on bone. The model was built considering the osteocyte as the sensing center mediated by coupled mechanical shear stress and some biological factors. The proposed enhanced model was developed based on previously published works dealing with different aspects of bone transduction. It describes the effects of physiological doses variations of Calcium, Parathyroid Hormone, Nitric Oxide and Prostaglandin E 2 on the stimulus level sensed by osteocytes in response to applied shear stress generated by interstitial fluid flow. We retained the metabolic factors (Parathyroid Hormone, Nitric Oxide, and Prostaglandin E 2) as parameters of bone cell mechanosensitivity because stimulation/inhibition of induced pathways stimulates osteogenic response in vivo. We then tested the model response in term of <b>stimulus</b> <b>signal</b> variation versus the biological factors doses to external mechanical stimuli. Despite {{the limitations of the}} model, it is consistent and has physiological bases. Biological inputs are histologically measurable. This makes the model amenable to experimental verification...|$|E
40|$|Robotic hand-eye {{coordination}} {{is recognized as}} an important skill to deal with complex real environments. Conventional robotic {{hand-eye coordination}} methods merely transfer <b>stimulus</b> <b>signals</b> from robotic visual space to hand actuator space. This paper introduces a reverse method: Build another channel that transfers <b>stimulus</b> <b>signals</b> from robotic hand space to visual space. Based on the reverse channel, a human-like behavior pattern: “Stop-to-Fixate”, is imparted to the robot, thereby giving the robot an enhanced reaching ability. A visual processing system inspired by the human retina structure is used to compress visual information so as to reduce the robot’s learning complexity. In addition, two constructive neural networks establish the two sensory delivery channels. The experimental results demonstrate that the robotic system gradually obtains a reaching ability. In particular, when the robotic hand touches an unseen object, the reverse channel successfully drives the visual system to notice the unseen object...|$|R
40|$|Consistent {{with human}} {{gambling}} behaviour but contrary to optimal foraging theory, pigeons showed maladaptive choice behaviour in experiment 1 by choosing an alternative that provided on average two food pellets over an alternative {{that provided a}} certain three food pellets. On 20 per cent of the trials, choice of the two-pellet alternative resulted in a stimulus that always predicted ten food pellets; on the remaining 80 per cent of the trials, the two-pellet alternative resulted in a different stimulus that always predicted zero food pellets. Choice of the three-pellet alternative always resulted in three food pellets. This choice behaviour mimics human monetary gambling in which the infrequent occurrence of a <b>stimulus</b> <b>signalling</b> the winning event (10 pellets) is overemphasized and the more frequent occurrence of a <b>stimulus</b> <b>signalling</b> the losing event (zero pellets) is underemphasized, compared with the certain outcome associated with not gambling (the signal for three pellets). In experiment 2, choice of the two-pellet alternative resulted in ten pellets with a probability of 20 per cent following presentation of either stimulus. Choice of the three-pellet alternative continued to result in three food pellets. In this case, the pigeons reliably chose the alternative that provided a certain three pellets over the alternative that provided {{an average of two}} pellets. Thus, in experiment 1, the pigeons were responding to obtain the discriminative <b>stimuli</b> <b>signalling</b> reinforcement and the absence of reinforcement, rather than to obtain the variability in reinforcement...|$|R

40|$|The pathway {{from the}} deep {{cerebellar}} nuclei to the inferior olive, the nucleo-olivary pathway, {{is known to be}} inhibitory. The physiological and temporal properties, as well as the localisation, of the nucleo-olivary pathway were characterised in the decerebrate ferret. The results were used to investigate the suggestion that the nucleo-olivary pathway is part of a negative feedback system for the regulation of spontaneous Purkinje cell activity. This hypothesis was proposed because output from the inferior olive, via the climbing fibres, is known to depress Purkinje cell activity. The feedback hypothesis was tested both by blocking and by stimulating the nucleo-olivary pathway. Blocking was followed by an increased climbing fibre activity and a rapid decrease of Purkinje cell background activity. Stimulation of the nucleo-olivary pathway caused the reverse effect. The results from the initial investigation were also applied in behavioural studies to investigate the pathway for the unconditioned <b>stimulus</b> <b>signal</b> in classical conditioning of the eyeblink reflex. It has been suggested that the climbing fibres transmit the unconditioned <b>stimulus</b> <b>signal</b> to the cerebellum. Repeated presentations of the conditioned stimulus on its own leads to extinction of the conditioned response. If the unconditioned <b>stimulus</b> <b>signal</b> is transmitted to the cerebellum via the inferior olive?climbing fibre system, then stimulation of the nucleo-olivary pathway just prior to the unconditioned stimulus, in a trained animal, should lead to extinction.

In Experiments 1 a and 1 b the <b>stimuli</b> <b>signaling</b> the components were two different light intensities, and in Experiments 2 a and 2 b {{they were two}} identical intensities. The components of the multiple schedule changed probabilistically after each reinforcer. In Experiments 1 a and 2 a, the probability of presenting the components was varied over five conditions and a replication. In Experiments 1 b and 2 b, the component probability was. 5 and the component reinforcer rates were varied systematically over five conditions and a replication. The data, analyzed according to the Davison-Tustin behavioral detection model, confirmed that the discriminability of the <b>stimuli</b> <b>signaling</b> the components was high when the stimuli were different, and low when the stimuli were the same. Discriminability, measured by log d, was unaffected by component probability variation and by component reinforcer-rate variation. When discriminability was high, bias, or the response allocation between the two keys, was more strongly affected by variation of reinforcer rate within components than by variation of component probability, but the reverse was found when discriminability was low. The results suggest that free-operant detection performance {{is controlled by the}} rates of reinforcers in periods of time in which <b>stimuli</b> <b>signal</b> differential contingencies.
