50|$|A mill {{was built}} in 1885 by James Ashton, Joseph Purdy, William Rowland, and a Mr. Sherman on a small inlet of Burley Lagoon just down the hill from present day Peninsula High School. In 1886, the Purdy mill secured its first {{contract}} to provide huge lumber with one edge beveled {{for the construction of}} a wooden dry dock at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in nearby Bremerton. The mill could underbid their competitors because they used an extra saw to cut the bevel, which allowed them to use only four trips of the <b>saw</b> <b>carriage</b> instead of five.|$|E
50|$|Further renumberings {{have taken}} place as new {{locomotives}} were introduced. Most have involved {{only a handful of}} carriages, but a major one <b>saw</b> <b>carriages</b> in the 920xx series renumbered 929xx when Class 92 locomotives were introduced.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the <b>sawing</b> <b>carriage</b> of machine, model CTMF. The {{purpose of the}} work: the {{development}} of the system of testing and prognosing the reliability of the wood-processing equipment in the course of its manufacture and operation on the base of the automated meter-diagnostic complexes. The combined method of evaluation of the wood-processing equipment reliability level, the dynamic model of the <b>sawing</b> <b>carriage</b> of the CTMF machine; the model of vibrodiagnostics of the cutting mechanism; the structure and requirements to the meter-diagnostic complex corresponding to the specificity of the wood-processing equipment have been developed. Created has been the meter-diagnostic complex intended for studying the reliability of the wood-processing equipment. For the first time, performed have been the automated service life tests of the wood-cutting machine on the base of the created complex. The software for processing the test results has been developed. The combined method of prognosing and testing for reliability has been introduced in the Company Stock "Krasnui Metallist" (Stavropol). The efficiecy of introduction: the cost of the combined automated tests is less by 30 %, the duration is reduced more than five times as compared with the accelerated tests to be performed bu usual methodsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

60|$|The event {{showed that}} Mr. George {{was right in}} his calculations. The Hotel d'Amerique was full. The waiter, who came out, {{as soon as he}} <b>saw</b> the <b>carriage</b> stop at the door, told Mr. George this in French.|$|R
60|$|Isobel looked {{round and}} <b>saw</b> a <b>carriage</b> with a {{magnificent}} pair of horses, in harness almost covered with silver ornaments, {{drive up to}} a place that had been kept vacant for it. Four natives were sitting in it.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] exclaimed Dot again, {{and before}} {{he had time to}} say {{anything}} more she <b>saw</b> a <b>carriage</b> drive around {{to the front of the}} palace. Then the door quickly opened, and what looked to be a lady came out and entered the carriage.|$|R
6000|$|On {{a bright}} cold {{afternoon}} the next spring, Theodora was setting {{out for a}} walk, when she <b>saw</b> a <b>carriage</b> driving up the avenue, and Arthur emerging from it.

6000|$|... 'That's {{the right}} style of woman,' soliloquized Percy, as he <b>saw</b> the <b>carriage</b> drive off. 'Gentleness, meekness, and {{a dash of}} good sense, is the recipe for a {{rational}} female--otherwise she is a blunder of nature.

5000|$|The {{first attempt}} to apply TOPS to diesel {{multiple}} units <b>saw</b> each <b>carriage</b> within a unit being allocated its own unique class number.

60|$|Mary, {{when she}} <b>saw</b> the <b>carriage,</b> at once {{ran up to}} her own bedroom.

6000|$|... 'Nonsense: it {{is quite}} necessary; it will rain again directly, {{and you are not}} half recovered.' And without more ado Knight took her hand, drew it under his arm, and held it there so firmly that she could not have removed it without a struggle. Feeling like a colt in a halter for the first time, at thus being led along, yet afraid to be angry, it was to her great relief that she <b>saw</b> the <b>carriage</b> coming round the corner to fetch them.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the same}} moment, Isabel {{burst into the}} room {{in a state of}} {{excitement}} which actually ignored the formidable presence of Miss Pink. [...] "I beg your pardon, aunt!

6000|$|... "Forgotten!" [...] {{said the}} old lady, glaring at the turnips. [...] "It isn't {{an easy thing to}} forget.

60|$|At {{the village}} a large, fat butcher, {{who was sitting}} tilted back in {{a chair at the}} door of his shop, <b>saw</b> the <b>carriage</b> coming in a {{whirlwind}} of dust, and he knew what the matter was.
