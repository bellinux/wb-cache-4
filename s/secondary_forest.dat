At present, post extraction <b>secondary</b> <b>forests</b> are the main source of wood products of the country.

5|$|Forest {{and river}} {{habitats}} in the watershed have been heavily affected by human activities ever since Gold Rush mining {{began in the}} 1800s. Commercial logging has caused mountain slopes to become more prone to erosion; even {{in areas that are}} no longer logged and have seen <b>secondary</b> <b>forest</b> growth, abandoned logging roads pose a serious erosive threat. Grazing of livestock has also degraded grasslands and exposed soils to runoff. This has resulted in river channels becoming clogged and confined by sediment, harming salmon and steelhead populations by burying gravel bars used by these fish for spawning. Along the South Fork, this problem has been exacerbated by the inherently unstable rocks and soils of the Franciscan formation, causing mass wasting events that dump sediment into streams.|$|E

40|$|Deforestation {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of {{biodiversity}} loss. Globally, large areas of primary forest have been replaced by <b>secondary</b> <b>forests</b> and plantations, and changes in tree species composition have often led to alteration of plant and animal communities that were associated with those primary forests. Hong Kong has experienced a long history of deforestation and may be one of the pioneers in using exotic tree plantations for forest restoration in Asia. In this study, we sampled herpetofaunal assemblages in native, <b>secondary</b> <b>forests</b> and exotic Lophostemon confertus plantations by transect surveys, pitfall traps, and coverboards. Amphibians were more abundant in <b>secondary</b> <b>forests</b> than in plantations, while the abundance of reptiles and species compositions of both amphibians and reptiles were similar in both forest types. Body condition of the most common reptile, Sphenomorphus indicus (Indian forest skink), was similar between <b>secondary</b> <b>forests</b> and plantations. However, higher proportions of S. indicus exhibited autotomized or missing tails in <b>secondary</b> <b>forests</b> than in plantations, which may be related to higher percentages of rock and wood cover on the forest floor potentially increasing the chance of escape from predators in <b>secondary</b> <b>forests.</b> <b>Secondary</b> <b>forests</b> may provide a better habitat for herpetofauna, we suggest that planting of a mixture of native tree species and thinning of exotic trees may be favorable management efforts to enhance biodiversity in future plantation in South China. © 2012 Elsevier B.
