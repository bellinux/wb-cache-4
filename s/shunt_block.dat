40|$|Forty-six {{neonates}} {{with various}} conditions of low pulmonary blood flow received a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt with a polytetrafluoroethylene graft. Ages ranged from 2 to 30 days (mean, 14. 1 days). Hospital mortality was 10. 9 %. <b>Shunt</b> <b>block</b> requiring reoperation occurred in 3 patients. Incremental {{risk factors for}} early mortality {{were found to be}} restrictive atrial septal defect, univentricular physiology, and postoperative reintervention. It was found that a Blalock-Taussig shunt could be performed in the neonatal period with a predictable outcome.

40|$|Aims : Nitric oxide (NO) in {{peripheral}} venous blood {{has been}} shown to be elevated in experimental portal hypertension. This study aims to determine the serum NO levels in patients with extrahepatic portal venous hypertension (EHPVO) pre- and postoperatively and to analyze whether these can serve as a reliable and early indicator of shunt blockage or malfunction. Materials and Methods: During the period 2006 - 2010, 48 children with EHPVO were included in this prospective study; 40 underwent porto-systemic shunt and eight underwent splenectomy with devascularization. NO was evaluated preoperatively, 14 days after surgery, at 3 months and then 6 monthly thereafter. The median follow-up duration was 21 months. Shunt patency was confirmed with Doppler and computed tomography portography. Forty-eight age-matched children with hypospadias served as controls. Results : NO was higher in EHPVO patients as compared with controls (43. 16 &# 177; 16. 27 vs. 5. 76 &# 177; 2. 62 &# 956;mol/l) (P = 0. 0001). There was a significant decline in the NO levels (4. 64 &# 177; 3. 18 &# 956;mol/l) following shunt surgery (P = 0. 0001), and it continued to remain low till the shunt was patent. A <b>shunt</b> <b>block</b> was indicated by rising NO levels in all five patients. The devascularization group also demonstrated a significant decline in the NO levels (27. 06 &# 177; 3. 56 &# 956;mol/l) (P = 0. 002), but it was less as compared with the shunted patients. The decline in the portal pressure after shunt surgery was found to correlate with the decline in the serum NO levels. Conclusions : The blood levels of NO can be used in the diagnosis of portal hypertension, and are useful for monitoring the patency of the shunt...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{presents}} the noise reduction performance of piezoelectric smart panels featuring piezoelectric shunt damping. A piezoelectric smart panel is a plate structure {{on which a}} piezoelectric patch with an electrical shunt circuit is attached. When an incidence sound is impinged on the panel structure, the structure vibrates and the attached piezoelectric patch produces electrical energy, which is effectively dissipated as heat via an electrical shunt circuit. Since the energy dissipation strongly depends on the vibration mode of the panel structure, many patches are required for multiple vibration modes. Instead of using multiple piezoelectric patches, a single piezoelectric patch is {{used in conjunction with}} <b>blocked</b> <b>shunt</b> circuit for multimode shunt damping. Modeling, shunt parameter tuning, and implementation of the <b>blocked</b> <b>shunt</b> circuit on the panels are explained. Key Words: smart panel, broadband noise reduction, multimode shunt damping, electrical impedance model...|$|R
40|$|A lumbar peritoneal (LP) shunt is a {{technique}} of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion from the lumbar thecal sac to the peritoneal cavity. It is indicated under {{a large number of}} conditions such as communicating hydrocephalus, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, normal pressure hydrocephalus, spinal and cranial CSF leaks, pseudomeningoceles, slit ventricle syndrome, growing skull fractures which are difficult to treat by conventional methods (when dural defect extends deep in the cranial base or across venous sinuses and in recurrent cases after conventional surgery), raised intracranial pressure following chronic meningitis, persistent bulging of craniotomy site after operations for intracranial tumors or head trauma, syringomyelia and failed endoscopic third ventriculostomy with a patent stoma. In spite of the large number of indications of this shunt and being reasonably good, safe, and effective, very few reports about the LP shunt exist in the literature. This procedure did not get its due importance due to some initial negative reports. This review article is based on search on Google and PubMed. This article is aimed to review indications, complications, results, and comparison of the LP shunt with the commonly practiced ventriculoperitoneal (VP) <b>shunt.</b> <b>Shunt</b> <b>blocks,</b> infections, CSF leaks, overdrainage and acquired Chiari malformation (ACM) are some of the complications of the LP shunt. Early diagnosis of overdrainage complications and ACM as well as timely appropriate treatment especially by programmable shunts could decrease morbidity. Majority of recent reports suggest that a LP shunt is a better alternative to the VP shunt in communicating hydrocephalus. It has an advantage over the VP shunt of being completely extracranial and can be used under conditions other than hydrocephalus when the ventricles are normal sized or chinked. More publications are required to establish its usefulness in the treatment of wide variety of indications...|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the goods}} yard siding was {{extended}} across the station approach to serve a timber yard which had opened {{to the west of the}} station. This arrangement not only blocked passengers' access to the ticket office when wagons were being <b>shunted,</b> but also <b>blocked</b> all means of entry to the timber yard. An additional siding was therefore laid to provide a bypass for the shed which effectively put it on a short loop. Another siding was laid across the road in 1923 when Oxford Farmers Ltd opened a bacon factory.|$|R

50|$|Traffic {{along the}} line was {{regulated}} by block working. Abbots Ripton and Holme had signal boxes and between them were two intermediate boxes. All controlled 'home' signals near the box and 'distant' signals {{about half a mile}} (c 800 m) before the home signals. The line was thus divided into three blocks, each roughly 2 miles (c 3.1 km) long; entry to each block was controlled by the signal box {{at the start of the}} <b>block.</b> <b>Shunting</b> into the siding at Abbots Ripton took place in a fourth block. The 'home' signals at Abbots Ripton were interlocked with the siding points and so that whenever the points were open to the main line the Abbots Ripton home signal lever had to be at 'danger'.|$|R
40|$|Since {{traditional}} soft {{load balancing}} algorithm in the heterogeneous wireless networks exists {{the problem of}} high load deviation and low system throughput, this paper proposes grid-based load-balancing algorithm to improve the integration of heterogeneous wireless throughput and reduce business delay and load deviation, while ensuring network quality of service basis. The algorithm proposed in this paper maps the wireless resource into different three-dimensional resource unit under the condition of full consideration of customers' business needs and difference matching of heterogeneous resources unit, and then divides the business into different sub-business traffic which is distributed to different network grid to achieve business distributed shunt. This gives specific process of load balancing algorithm. Finally, we perform the simulation experiments with MLB and DLBD algorithm on the aspects of <b>shunt</b> times, business <b>blocking</b> probability and network load balancing degree. Experiments show that: the algorithm proposed in this paper improves the utilization of the heterogeneous wireless resource, and improves performance of system. </p...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} recommended that, {{in cases of}} difficulty in removing a ventricular catheter during a shunt revision, it is best left alone to avoid intraventricular haemorrhage. Retained ventricular catheters (RVCs) are usually safe, although {{in the presence of}} ventriculitis they may become colonized by organisms and become a source of persistent or recurrent infection. The authors present a case of persistent and intractable ventriculitis due to an old retained ventricular catheter. A 23 -year-old female, who had a RVC and a functioning shunt, was admitted for a suspected <b>blocked</b> <b>shunt.</b> At surgery the shunt was found to be infected and external drainage was instituted. Over the next 4 months, she developed intractable and persistent staphylococcal ventriculitis, despite undergoing 10 further surgical procedures, and appropriate intravenous and intrathecal antibiotic therapy. She responded rapidly only after surgical removal of the old RVC via a craniotomy. The staphylococcus cultured from the RVC had an identical antibiogram to the organism responsible for the intractable ventriculitis. This case emphasizes the point that, although RVC are generally considered safe, removal becomes imperative in the presence of concurrent CSF infection that fails to respond quickly to intrathecal antibiotic therapy...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{inhibition}} {{in control}} of plateau-generating neurones in the dorsal horn was studied in an in vitro preparation of the spinal cord of the turtle. Ionotropic and metabotropic inhibition was found to condition the expression of plateau potentials. Blockade of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) and glycine receptors by their selective antagonists bicuculline (10 - 50 μM) and strychnine (5 - 20 μM) enhanced the excitatory response to stimulation of the dorsal root and facilitated the expression of plateau potentials. Bicuculline and strychnine also facilitated the generation of plateau potentials in response to depolarizing current pulses, suggesting the presence of tonic ionotropic inhibitory mechanisms in turtle spinal cord slices. Activation of GABAB receptors also inhibited plateau-generating neurones. The selective agonist baclofen (5 - 50 μM) inhibited wind-up of the response to repeated depolarizations induced synaptically or by intracellular current pulses. Baclofen reduced afferent synaptic input. This effect was not affected by bicuculline or strychnine and was blocked by the selective GABAB receptor antagonist 2 -hydroxysaclofen (2 -OH-saclofen, 100 - 400 μM). Postsynaptically, baclofen inhibited plateau properties. Activation of GABAB receptors produced a hyperpolarization (7. 0 ± 0. 5 mV, mean ± s. e. m., n= 29) with an associated decrease in input resistance (22. 7 ± 3. 1 %, n= 24). These effects were blocked by extracellular Ba 2 + (1 - 2 mM). When the baclofen-induced hyperpolarization and shunt were compensated for by adjusting the bias current {{and the strength of}} the stimulus, baclofen still inhibited generation of plateau potentials. Wind-up and after-discharges were also inhibited by baclofen. These effects remained in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 μM) and were antagonized by 2 -OH-saclofen. The inhibition of plateau properties was observed even when the baclofen-induced hyperpolarization and <b>shunt</b> were <b>blocked</b> by Ba 2 + and when potassium channels were blocked by Ba 2 + (3 mM), tetraethylammonium (TEA, 15 mM) and apamin (0. 25 - 0. 5 μM). The baclofen-sensitive component of the plateau potential was reduced by nifedipine (10 μM), suggesting a modulation of postsynaptic L-type Ca 2 + channels. We suggest that inhibitory regulation of plateau properties plays a role in somatosensory processing in the dorsal horn. The inhibitory control of wind-up and after-discharges may be particularly significant in physiological and therapeutic control of central sensitization to pain...|$|R
40|$|Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is {{considered}} as a treatment of choice for obstructive hydrocephalus. It is indicated in hydrocephalus secondary to congenital aqueductal stenosis, posterior third ventricle tumor, cerebellar infarct, Dandy-Walker malformation, vein of Galen aneurism, syringomyelia with or without Chiari malformation type I, intraventricular hematoma, post infective, normal pressure hydrocephalus, myelomeningocele, multiloculated hydrocephalus, encephalocele, posterior fossa tumor and craniosynostosis. It is also indicated in <b>block</b> <b>shunt</b> or slit ventricle syndrome. Proper Pre-operative imaging for detailed assessment of the posterior communicating arteries distance from mid line, {{presence or absence of}} Liliequist membrane or other membranes, located in the prepontine cistern is useful. Measurement of lumbar elastance and resistance can predict patency of cranial subarachnoid space and complex hydrocephalus, which decides an ultimate outcome. Water jet dissection is an effective technique of ETV in thick floor. Ultrasonic contact probe can be useful in selected patients. Intra-operative ventriculo-stomography could help in confirming the adequacy of endoscopic procedure, thereby facilitating the need for shunt. Intraoperative observations of the patent aqueduct and prepontine cistern scarring are predictors of the risk of ETV failure. Such patients may be considered for shunt surgery. Magnetic resonance ventriculography and cine phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging are effective in assessing subarachnoid space and stoma patency after ETV. Proper case selection, post-operative care including monitoring of ICP and need for external ventricular drain, repeated lumbar puncture and CSF drainage, Ommaya reservoir in selected patients could help to increase success rate and reduce complications. Most of the complications develop in an early post-operative, but fatal complications can develop late which indicate an importance of long term follow up...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{new ways to}} {{experimentally}} realise materials with desired nano-structures for solution-processable optoelectronic devices such as solar cells and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and examine structure-performance relationships in these devices. Short exciton diffusion length limits the efficiency of most exciton-based solar cells. By introducing nano-structured architectures to solar cells, excitons can be separated more effectively, leading to an enhancement of the cell’s power conversion efficiency. We use diblock copolymer lithography combined with solvent-vapour-assisted imprinting to fabricate nano-structures with 20 - 80 nm feature sizes. We demonstrate nanostructured solar cell incorporating the high-performance polymer PBDTTT-CT. Furthermore, we demonstrated the patterning of singlet fission materials, including a TIPS-pentacene solar cell based on ZnO nanopillars. Recently perovskites have emerged as a promising semiconductor for optoelectronic applications. We demonstrate a perovskite light-emitting diode that employs perovskite nanoparticles embedded in a dielectric polymer matrix as the emissive layer. The emissive layer is spin-coated from perovskite precursor/polymer blend solution. The resultant polymer-perovskite composites effectively <b>block</b> <b>shunt</b> pathways within the LED, thus leading to an external quantum efficiency of 1. 2 %, one order of magnitude higher than previous reports. We demonstrate formations of stably emissive perovskite nanoparticles in an alumina nanoparticle matrix. These nanoparticles have much higher photoluminescence quantum efficiency (25 %) than bulk perovskite and the emission {{is found to be}} stable over several months. Finally, we demonstrate a new vapour-phase crosslinking method to construct full-colour perovskite nanocrystal LEDs. With detailed structural and compositional analysis we are able to pinpoint the aluminium-based crosslinker that resides between the nanocrystals, which enables remarkably high EQE of 5. 7 % in CsPbI 3 LEDs.

40|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty-five CSF diversion. ary shunt patency studies {{were carried out}} in {{children}} using 2 PCi/kg of 1111 n-DTPA. A total of four incorrect diagnoses occurred. The re suits were reproducible in 12 patients who had repeat studies without a change in clinical sta tus. The radiopharmaceutical is safe since we had no reactions, and appears to be especially valuable for examining children because of the low radiation dose. As a result of the consist enhly reliable assessment of function of these shunts and a complete acceptance of the tech. nique by our neurosurgeons, the number of air ventriculograms and surgical explorations for diagnosis in patients whose shunts were patent have been significantly reduced. Currently, over I, 000 treated hydrocephalic chil dren are being followed by our institution. In 1972, 225 new shunts were inserted and 377 revised. It is extremely difficult to judge the patency of a CSF diversionary shunt because of its nonspecific clinical presentation. Of 90 patients thought to have <b>blocked</b> <b>shunts</b> who had brain scans, 13 had subdural hema tomas and 5 had recurrent tumors as a cause of their symptoms. The importance of establishing a benign, easy, and accurate method for determining shunt patency is evident. Although there have been numerous descriptive papers discussing shunt patency studies (1 â€” 3), none have described results with regard to the scan ap pearance of a properly or poorly functioning shunt. Approximately nine months ago we began to use 111 In-DTPA (Diagnostic Isotopes) for our CSF in vestigations including shunt patency studies.

40|$|Background High {{incidence}} of atrioventricular (AV) block {{has been the}} major limitation of percutaneous closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defect (PMVSD). Methods Prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized study including 55 patients who were submitted to 56 procedures from March 2010 to November 2010. Inclusion criteria were PMVSD with diameter = 5 mm or if = 5 mm with hemodynamic significance and age = 1 year. Exclusion criteria were fixed pulmonary arterial hypertension and associated congenital heart disease needing surgical repair. Procedures were performed under general anesthesia and monitored by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). the device choice was based on left ventricle (LV) angiography and on TTE images. PMVSDs were crossed by retrograde approach. Results Mean age was 9. 3 +/- 7. 5 years, and mean weight was 29. 1 +/- 15. 9 kg. Thirty-five (63. 6 %) patients were females. Mean pulmonary arterial mean pressure, mean LV diastolic diameter, and mean Qp/Qs were 24. 0 +/- 6. 5 mm Hg, 43. 0 +/- 5. 9 mm, and 2. 2 +/- 0. 8, respectively. Associated nonsurgical malformations were present in 9 (16. 3 %) patients, and PMVSDs were multifenestrated in 16 (46. 2 %) cases. Mean PMVSDs diameter was 5. 8 +/- 1. 8 mm by angiography and 6. 8 +/- 2. 3 mm by TTE. New rhythm disturbance without clinical significance was observed in 29 % of the patients and was reversible in 87. 5 %. After procedure, trivial residual shunt was present in 5 (8. 9 %) patients and moderate residual shunt in other 5 (8. 9 %). At late FU (mean of 298. 7 +/- 88. 9 days), 91 % of the patients had no residual <b>shunts.</b> Third-degree AV <b>block</b> and severe aortic regurgitation occurred in one patient each. Conclusions in this experience, PMVSD closure with CERA (R) devices showed {{to be safe and}} effective with low {{incidence of}} complications at immediate and mid-term FU.
