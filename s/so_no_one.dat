When he opens it, aroused from sleeping, they hold him down and carve out his heart while he tries in vain to scream. At Giles' apartment his visiting girlfriend, Olivia, is frightened by one of The Gentlemen outside Giles' window. The following morning in a campus classroom, Giles uses a series of overhead transparencies to explain to the others that The Gentlemen steal the townspeople's voices <b>so</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> can scream as they gather the hearts they need, and that folklore indicates that they have been vanquished before when a princess screamed: the only thing that will kill them is a live human voice.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} such high incarceration rates are also shown in other ways. For example, {{a woman who has}} been {{recently}} released from prison is ineligible for welfare in most states. She is not eligible for subsidized housing, and for Section 8 she has to wait two years before she can apply. In addition to finding housing, she also has to find employment, but most likely she can not find a job because she has a criminal record <b>so</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> wants to hire her. Essentially, a woman who has been recently released from prison comes into a society that is not prepared structurally or emotionally to welcome her back.|$|E

The vehicle was an important stabilizer of the towers and, {{as a result of the}} vehicle's removal, the towers were able to sway past the 8 foot (2.4m) sway allowance. The park was closed for the winter, <b>so</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was injured. On March 11, 2002, the park announced the removal of VertiGo rides from both Cedar Point and Knott's Berry Farm, reasoning guests would be less likely to ride them after the collapse.|$|E
25|$|The United States also lacks {{an agency}} {{in charge of}} diamond import confirmations, which allows traders to bypass the {{requirement}} of reporting the receipt of the diamond shipment within 15 days of the arrival. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the agency in charge of overseeing incoming diamond shipments and conducting examinations of shipments. There is also little oversight of the U.S. Kimberley Process Authority (USKPA), {{who are responsible for}} issuing Kimberley Process certificates, <b>so</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> supervises the company making sure that USKPA adheres to KPCS standards. The closest oversight comes from the Department of State, who “convene periodic teleconferences with the USKPA”. The CDTA also does not directly deal with the retail diamond sector, as the Act only applies to rough diamonds as opposed to cut and polished diamonds. While some retailers take strong initiatives to avoid conflict diamonds, many do not, so the effectiveness of the Act to completely eliminate the trade of conflict diamonds is often questioned. It has also been suggested that other countries have similarly struggled with the implementation of the KPCS.|$|E
25|$|After the Emperor's death, Prime Minister Li Si, who {{accompanied}} him, became extremely {{worried that the}} news of his death could trigger a general uprising in the Empire. It would take two months for the entourage to reach the capital, {{and it would not}} be possible to stop the uprising. Li Si decided to hide the death of the Emperor, and return to Xianyang. Most of the Imperial entourage accompanying the Emperor were left ignorant of the Emperor's death; only a younger son, Ying Huhai, who was travelling with his father, the eunuch Zhao Gao, Li Si, and five or six favourite eunuchs knew of the death. Li Si also ordered that two carts containing rotten fish be carried immediately before and after the wagon of the Emperor. The idea behind this was to prevent people from noticing the foul smell emanating from the wagon of the Emperor, where his body was starting to decompose severely as it was summertime. They also pulled down the shade <b>so</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> could see his face, changed his clothes daily, brought food and when he had to have important conversations, they would act {{as if he wanted to}} send them a message.|$|E

25|$|The top 10 drivers {{set their}} early quick laps. Hamilton took the early lead with Vettel and Rosberg close behind. With only {{two minutes to}} go it {{looked to be a}} close to who would take pole position. The top three were {{unchanged}} with Vettel very quick on track while Rosberg was going even quicker. However, Barrichello spun off and hit the wall hard, destroying much of {{the left side of his}} car, which brought out the yellow flags meaning anyone who was on a flying lap had to slow down unless they had already passed the scene of the accident. The red flag was brought out with 26 seconds remaining on the clock. As no other cars crossed the line, Hamilton took pole position ahead of Vettel, Rosberg and Mark Webber. Although Barrichello qualified fifth, he started the race tenth after his gearbox change. The session was restarted with only 26 seconds left there was no time to start a flying lap <b>so</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> rejoined the circuit. This session was the third of four to be red flagged during the weekend, only the third practice session was not interrupted.|$|E
25|$|The {{championship}} game was a rematch against France, a team the USA {{had played in}} the preliminary round, winning by just six points. France scored first, {{and a few minutes}} into the game, the score was tied at six points each. However, the USA then went on an 11–2 run to open up a double-digit lead. The game was roughly even from then {{until the end of the}} half, with France cutting into the lead slightly. The USA led at halftime 27–20. Earlier in the day, Spain held a 14-point halftime lead over Australia in the Bronze medal game, but could not hold on to the lead, <b>so</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was thinking that a seven-point lead was safe. The second half was all USA. The USA started on a 10–0 run, and would end up surrendering only eight points in the second half. France ended up shooting under 22% from the field, and the USA would go on to win the game and the gold medal by a score of 61–28. Stewart was the high scorer for the team with 16 points, and also set a U19 all-time record for scoring with 152 points, which put her ahead of Maya Moore, who scored 147 in 2007. Alexis Jones had 29 assist during the tournament, tying an all-time U18 record established by Ariel Massengale. Stewart was named the MVP of the tournament and named to the all-tournament team.|$|E
25|$|The {{night of}} 30 January 1895 was stormy. In the North Sea, {{conditions}} were freezing {{and there were}} huge seas. SS Elbe had left Bremerhaven for New York {{earlier in the day}} with 354 passengers aboard. Also at sea on this rough night was the steamship Crathie, sailing from Aberdeen in Scotland, heading for Rotterdam. As conditions grew worse, the Elbe discharged warning rockets to alert other ships to her presence. The Crathie either did not see the warning rockets or chose to ignore them. She did not alter her course, with such disastrous consequences, that she struck the liner on her port side with such force that whole compartments of the Elbe were immediately flooded. The collision happened at 5.30 am and most of the passengers were still asleep.The Elbe began to sink immediately and the captain, von Goessel, gave the order to abandon ship. Amid great scenes of panic the crew managed to lower two of the Elbes lifeboats. One of the lifeboats capsized as too many passengers tried in vain to squeeze into the boat. Twenty people scrambled into the second lifeboat, of whom 15 were members of the crew. The others were four male second-class passengers and a young lady’s maid by the name of Anna Boecker, who had been lucky enough to be pulled from the raging sea after the first boat had capsized. Meanwhile, {{on the other side of}} the Elbe, Captain von Goessel had ordered all the women and children to assemble there but no other lifeboats were launched because the ropes on the derricks were all frozen up, and so they perished along with the captain. Within 20 minutes of the collision, the Elbe had sunk and the only survivors were the 20 people in the one surviving lifeboat. These people now had to endure mountainous seas and below-zero temperatures and they were 50 miles from land. Things looked bleak; the Elbes distress rockets had not been seen by any passing vessels and <b>so</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> knew of their predicament. After five hours in the raging storm, their luck changed. A fishing smack from Lowestoft called the Wildflower found them. In desperate conditions the crew of the Wildflower struggled to pull the 20 survivors from the lifeboat, which had begun to break up. The skipper, William Wright, said later that the survivors would not have lasted another hour in those conditions, and believed that the only reason they had stayed alive for five hours was the expertise of the Elbes crewmen aboard the lifeboat.|$|E
