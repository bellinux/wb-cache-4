5|$|As the {{aircraft}} flew eastwards over the outer suburbs of Perth numerous witnesses observed {{that it was}} flying at a lower altitude than usual for the daily Skymaster services, {{and at least one}} of the engines was running roughly and backfiring at regular intervals. In the minutes before it crashed, witnesses heard a number of different engine noises – sometimes operating normally, <b>sometimes</b> <b>all</b> engine noise ceased, only to be replaced by a very loud, high-pitched scream. When the wrecked engines were examined many weeks after the accident a significant amount of corrosion product was found in the fuel system within two of the engines. After a preliminary investigation, Investigators from the Department of Civil Aviation believed the water responsible for the corrosion was also responsible for rough running of at least one engine, and ultimately temporary loss of power from all engines on at least one occasion. The Investigators did not find a likely source for the water.|$|E

25|$|The {{middle and}} upper classes live in Suburbs, or in {{the central part of}} the bigger cities in apartments, where there is urban planning. Many of the houses they live in are like {{miniature}} fortresses, located behind walls embedded with metal spikes, barbed wire, broken glass, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>all</b> three. The gates to these houses are barred at night, the house is locked; guard dogs patrol the yard. These houses are often self-sufficient as well. The houses have backup generators, because the electrical grid in Haiti is unreliable. Some even have rooftop reservoirs for water, as the water supply is also unreliable.|$|E
25|$|The cost {{of group}} portraits was usually {{shared by the}} subjects, often not equally. The amount paid might {{determine}} each person's place in the picture, either head to toe in full regalia in the foreground or face only {{in the back of}} the group. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>all</b> group members paid an equal sum, which was likely to lead to quarrels when some members gained a more prominent place in the picture than others. In Amsterdam most of these paintings would ultimately end up in the possession of the city council, and many are now on display in the Amsterdams Historisch Museum; there are no significant examples outside the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until the}} start of the 20th century, St Andrews offered a {{traditional}} education based on classical languages, divinity and philosophical studies, and was slow to embrace more practical fields such as science and medicine that were becoming more popular at other universities. In response to the need for modernisation and in order to increase student numbers and alleviate financial problems, the university merged with University College, Dundee in 1897, which had a focus on scientific and professional subjects. After the incorporation of University College Dundee, St Andrews' various problems generally receded. Of note is that, up until 1967, many students who obtained a degree from the University of St Andrews had in fact spent most, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>all,</b> of their undergraduate career based in Dundee.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{the period}} of their {{production}} Nottingham alabaster images were hugely popular in Europe and were exported in large quantities, some ending up as far afield as Iceland, Croatia and Poland. But by far the greatest export market for these images was in France, where even today some churches retain in situ their English alabaster altarpieces, unlike England, where survivals are extremely rare. The sculptures were normally brightly painted, <b>sometimes</b> <b>all</b> over, sometimes partially, {{but much of the}} paint has often been lost, and many pieces have had the rest completely removed by dealers, collectors or museums in the past. Most alabaster altarpieces and religious carvings other than church monuments remaining in England were destroyed in the English Reformation, after which the many workshops had to change their products to concentrate on church monuments.|$|E
25|$|Overall, in 2007, 33% of {{employers}} gave employees the day off, a 2% {{increase over the}} previous year. There was little difference in observance by large and small employers: 33% for firms with over 1,000 employees; and, 32% for firms with under 1,000 employees. The observance is most popular among nonprofit organizations and least popular among factories and manufacturers. The reasons for this have varied, ranging from the recent addition of the holiday, to its occurrence {{just two weeks after}} the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, when many businesses are closed for part or <b>sometimes</b> <b>all</b> of the week. Additionally, many schools and places of higher education are closed for classes; others remain open but may hold seminars or celebrations of King's message. Some factories and manufacturers used MLK Day as a floating or movable holiday.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} {{treated as a}} {{subspecies}} of the common or black-winged stilt, using the trinomial name Himantopus himantopus mexicanus. However, the AOS has always considered it a species in its own right, and the scientific name Himantopus mexicanus is often seen. Matters are more complicated though; <b>sometimes</b> <b>all</b> five distinct lineages of the Common Stilt are treated as different species. But the white-backed stilt from southern South America (H. melanurus when the species is recognized), parapatric and intergrading to some extent with its northern relative where their ranges meet, would warrant inclusion with the Black-necked stilt when this is separated specifically, becoming Himantopus mexicanus melanurus. Similarly, the Hawaiian stilt, H. m. knudseni, is likely {{to belong to the}} American species when this is considered separate; while some treat it as another distinct species, the AOS, BirdLife International and the IUCN do not.|$|E

500|$|In naming Simone the 29th {{greatest}} {{singer of}} all time, Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "her honey-coated, slightly adenoidal cry {{was one of}} the most affecting voices of the civil rights movement", while making note of her ability to [...] "belt barroom blues, croon cabaret and explore jazz — <b>sometimes</b> <b>all</b> on a single record." [...] In the opinion of AllMusic's Mark Deming, she was [...] "one of the most gifted vocalists of her generation, and also one of the most eclectic". Creed Taylor, who annotated the liner notes for Simone's 1978 Baltimore album, said the singer possessed a [...] "magnificent intensity" [...] that [...] "turns everything—even the most simple, mundane phrase or lyric—into a radiant, poetic message". Music critic Jim Fusilli writes that Simone's music is still relevant today: [...] "it didn't adhere to ephemeral trends, it isn't a relic of a bygone era; her vocal delivery and technical skills as a pianist still dazzle; and her emotional performances have a visceral impact.|$|E

500|$|Later in 2012, Lawrence {{played a}} young {{depressed}} widow named Tiffany Maxwell in David O. Russell's romance movie Silver Linings Playbook. The film was {{an adaptation of}} the Matthew Quick's novel of the same name. It follows her character finding companionship with Pat Solitano Jr. (played by Bradley Cooper), a man with bipolar disorder. The actress was drawn to her character's complex personality: [...] "She didn't really fit any basic kind of character profile. Somebody who is very forceful and bullheaded is normally very insecure, but she isn't". Russell considered Lawrence to be too young for the part; she convinced him to hire her via a Skype audition. She found herself challenged by Russell's spontaneity as a director, and described working on the project as the [...] "best experience of my life". Richard Corliss of Time wrote: [...] "Just 21 when the movie was shot, Lawrence is that rare young actress who plays, who is, grown-up. Sullen and sultry, she lends a mature intelligence to any role." [...] Peter Travers believed that Lawrence [...] "is some kind of miracle. She's rude, dirty, funny, foulmouthed, sloppy, sexy, vibrant, and vulnerable, <b>sometimes</b> <b>all</b> in the same scene, even in the same breath." [...] She won the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film, becoming—at age 22—the second youngest Best Actress Oscar winner. Her final release {{of the year was}} alongside Max Thieriot and Elisabeth Shue in Mark Tonderai's critically panned thriller House at the End of the Street.|$|E
500|$|Scott Butterworth of GameSpot {{thought that}} the analog {{navigation}} tools – a hand-held compass and paper map – were [...] "immersive" [...] but [...] "occasionally frustrating". He found that the visual beauty of the setting allowed for a more rewarding form of exploration and noted that the sound design complemented the depth of its atmosphere. Judging {{the development of the}} characters through dialog to be [...] "bold" [...] and [...] "admirable", he opined that it served as [...] "a patient, reflective examination of how two people grow to trust and care for each other". According to Butterworth, the voice acting was brilliant and layered with emotional nuance, as he had evolved a strong attachment to the characters. GamesRadar's Justin Towell described Firewatch as [...] "one of the most enthralling slices of entertainment I've ever experienced". He commended the voice acting for having successfully defined each character's personality traits. Towell added that the music, alongside the sound design, worked well in service of the atmosphere. However, he disparaged a few noticeable continuity problems that left him disillusioned. Ryan McCaffrey at IGN hailed the sense of realism elicited by the setting, despite the stylized level design and artwork. He also approved of the script, saying that voice acting enhanced it further. Of the writing, McCaffrey said, [...] "It's tense, scary, and funny – <b>sometimes</b> <b>all</b> within a few minutes of each other. Not a lot of games can successfully claim that". He deemed the ending polarizing because of the story's promising escalation. Polygon's Colin Campbell appreciated the use of humor and empathy to develop the characters, considered the game's mystery to be successful and the story to be [...] "elegant" [...] and [...] "satisfying". He criticized the conclusion, regarding it as unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Matt Fowler {{wrote in}} his review, [...] "At this point, {{it seems like the}} pattern {{when it comes to the}} ninth episode of a given season of Game of Thrones is tragic death, amazing battle, tragic death, amazing battle, and so on. And this being Season 6, it was time to land on a phenomenal clash of swords and shields - and 'Battle of the Bastards' {{certainly}} delivered." [...] He continued, [...] "Game of Thrones did not disappoint when it came to this season's great northern battle, as Jon and Sansa's differences were spectacularly highlighted in a savagely strong war chapter that saw House Stark overcome huge odds to reclaim their home. Plus, Daenerys got to soar, as her dragons quickly stopped a violent siege with fury and fire." [...] Fowler gave the episode a top score of 10. Jeremy Egner of The New York Times also praised the episode: [...] "As directed by Miguel Sapochnik, who also oversaw last season's terrific 'Hardhome' episode, the lengthy sequence was terrifying, gripping and exhilarating, <b>sometimes</b> <b>all</b> at once, a sweeping display of all the different ways one can die on the battlefield." [...] Egner called Ramsay's death an episode highlight ("Ramsay Bolton's demise was arguably the most eagerly anticipated death ever on Game of Thrones and the show handled it with flair, dispatching him in a poetic, canine-fueled fashion that was no less satisfying for being telegraphed early on"), and concluded about Daenerys's scene: [...] "Daenerys Stormborn had a few words for the slave masters who launched their attack last week. Those words included 'surrender or die' and 'thanks for the ships', as we saw another thrilling action sequence that I believe reunited the dragon triplets for the first time since they were quite young." [...] Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{wrote in his}} review, [...] "This battle works as a climactic moment for Game of Thrones as a cultural event, selling us on the scale and ambition of the producers and their production teams, all who should be commended for the accomplishments from a technical perspective." [...] According to James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Was this the show's best episode? It's hard to immediately process that question. Maybe? Probably. It's almost certainly the most exciting hour and had the most jaw-dropping battle sequence we've seen yet on TV." ...|$|E

500|$|Ready {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} professional critics, which received an aggregate score of 67 out of 100. The score, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews" [...] {{was based on}} six reviews from website Metacritic. It received many comparisons {{to the work of}} R artist R. Kelly, while several critics noted it as inconsistent. David Jeffries of Allmusic said that [...] "Even at a whopping 17 like-minded tracks, all-night lovers wouldn't be caught dead complaining about how overly long it all is", commenting that Ready [...] "is as entertaining and frivolous as a one-night stand should be." [...] Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe said that Songz had developed as a vocalist stating his voice was more [...] "elastic" [...] and he used his falsetto [...] "judiciously." [...] Capobianco commended tracks like [...] "Be Where You Are," [...] and [...] "Love Lost", commenting that [...] "tracks like that show that he is indeed ready for the next step." [...] Andrew Rennie of Now said, [...] "slight deviations from R classic formula allow Trey Songz wiggle room to play with his multi-octave voice. This offering sets him apart from other acts and may secure his spot in the canon of bedroom crooners." [...] Glenn Gamboa of Newsday said that after making his name for singing hooks on rap songs, that he [...] "shows his smooth R vocals can hold the spotlight all on their own." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album 3½ out of 5 stars and wrote that Songz [...] "takes cues from R. Kelly, slyly mocking the self-parodying excesses of boudoir R while supplying the utilitarian goods: the sumptuous vocal harmonies and sultry beats upon which long nights beneath ceiling mirrors depend". A writer for USA Today said the album reflects his broad appeal, and that Songz's proves [...] "he's comfortable as a rogue or romantic. Even though the review pointed out that [...] "he occasionally falls back on booty-call clichés," [...] it did point out that [...] "his song craft shines on the edgy [...] "Black Roses" [...] and regretful [...] "Love Lost." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said, [...] "'Ready' is one of the year’s most promising R albums, and a curious one at that", commenting, [...] "the results are bawdy but never lecherous; <b>sometimes</b> <b>all</b> his enthusiastic bedroom talk has an air of childlike goofiness to it, as if he were thrilled to get away with boasting so freely." [...] Sean Fennesssy of The Village Voice called the album [...] "one of the year's best..." ...|$|E
500|$|Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{gave the}} film 4 (out of 5) stars, {{saying that it}} was [...] "attention-grabbing from {{inception}} till conclusion.

[...] Rachit Gupta of Filmfare gave it 4 (out of 5) stars: [...] "At a gracious 3 hours runtime, JTHJ feels like an epic love story. And it is just that. JTHJ is the perfect adieu to a hallmark career. It is the best romantic film made in this generation." [...] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave it 3.5 (out of 5) stars: [...] "Despite the lovey-dovey nothingness that drives the plot, Jab Tak Hai Jaan has more substance than most romantic films that come out of Bollywood." [...] Meena Iyer of The Times of India rated it 3.5 (out of 5) stars, saying: [...] "Every frame is picture-perfect, the emotions are well nuanced. But there is one inherent flawthe story by Aditya Chopra is hackneyed." [...] Subhash Jha (also from The Times of India) said, [...] "Jab Tak Hai Jaan makes {{you fall in love with}} love all over again." [...] Anupama Chopra of the Hindustan Times gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "Jab Tak Hai Jaan is too tangled to transport you. But I recommend that you see it. Because only Yash Chopra could make heartache so attractive and ennobling that his characters wear it like a badge of honor." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "I'm going with three out of five for the late Yash Chopra's Jab Tak Hai Jaan. Despite its many script problems, it's a consistently watchable film that oozes with feeling and real emotion. A fitting swan song." [...] OPEN magazine gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars, praising Yash Chopra's direction. Ajit Duara called it [...] "a deeply-felt cinematic perspective from 80 years of living." [...] Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, saying: [...] "As a swan-song for the master director, Jab Tak Hai Jaan might only be a middling effort. But then, <b>sometimes,</b> <b>all</b> we need is a Khan-song." [...] Shabana Ansari of Daily News and Analysis gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "If you must, watch Jab Tak Hai Jaan for Shah Rukh, who can still convey love and passion in a fleeting look or a dimpled smile; and for Yash Chopra who gave us some of the most enduring romances of all times." ...|$|E
