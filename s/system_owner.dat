It uses a layered structure where the attacker uses a client program to connect to handlers, which are compromised systems that issue commands to the zombie agents, which in turn facilitate the DDoS attack. Agents are compromised via the handlers by the attacker, using automated routines to exploit vulnerabilities in programs that accept remote connections running on the targeted remote hosts. Each handler can control up to a thousand agents.|$|E
2500|$|Code signing uses public-key {{infrastructure}} to check if a file has been modified since being digitally signed by its publisher. Alternatively, a <b>system</b> <b>owner</b> or administrator {{can use a}} cryptographic hash function to compute a [...] "fingerprint" [...] at installation time that can help to detect subsequent unauthorized changes to on-disk code libraries. However, unsophisticated schemes check only whether the code has been modified since installation time; subversion prior to that time is not detectable. The fingerprint must be re-established each time changes are made to the system: for example, after installing security updates or a service pack. The hash function creates a message digest, a relatively short code calculated from each bit in the file using an algorithm that creates large changes in the message digest with even smaller changes to the original file. By recalculating and comparing the message digest of the installed files at regular intervals against a trusted list of message digests, changes in the system can be detected and monitored—as long as the original baseline was created before the malware was added.|$|E

40|$|Part 2 : CONTROL SYSTEMS SECURITYInternational audienceThe chapter {{discusses}} the important issue {{of responsibility for}} information and communications technology (ICT) – or cyber – safety and security for industrial control systems and the challenges involved in dividing the responsibility between industrial control <b>system</b> <b>owners</b> and suppliers in the Norwegian electric power supply industry. Industrial control <b>system</b> <b>owners</b> are increasingly adopting information and communications technologies to enhance business system connectivity and remote access. This integration offers new capabilities, but it reduces the isolation of industrial control systems from the outside world, creating greater security needs. The results of observation studies indicate that Norwegian power network companies and industrial control system suppliers {{have contributed to the}} creation of a culture that does not focus on information and communications systems safety and security. The increased use of standards and guidelines can help improve cooperation between industrial control <b>system</b> <b>owners</b> and suppliers. Norwegian industrial control <b>system</b> <b>owners</b> should also implement a culture change in their organizations and should attempt to influence the safety and security culture of their suppliers. Power network companies need to place information and communications systems safety and security on par with operational priorities and they need to become more vocal in demanding secure products from their suppliers...|$|R
