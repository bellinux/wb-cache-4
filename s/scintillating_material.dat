50|$|The typical {{detector}} {{segment is}} a piece of <b>scintillating</b> <b>material,</b> which emits light when a particle passes through it. The scintillation light can be converted to an electrical signal either by a photomultiplier tube (PMT) or a PIN diode. If a segment measures some significant amount of light, the experimenter can infer that a particle passed through that segment. In addition to coordinate information, for some systems the strength of the light can be proportional to the deposited energy. By doing necessary calibrations, the deposited energy can be determined, which then can be used to inferinformation about the original particle's energy.|$|E

While the fast component usually dominates, the relative amplitude A and B of the two components depend on the <b>scintillating</b> <b>material.</b> Both of these components {{can also be a}} function of the energy loss dE/dx. In cases where this energy loss dependence is strong, the overall decay time constant varies with the type of incident particle. Such scintillators enable pulse shape discrimination, i.e., particle identification based on the decay characteristics of the PMT electric pulse. For instance, when BaF2 is used, γ rays typically excite the fast component, while α particles excite the slow component: it is thus possible to identify them based on the decay time of the PMT signal.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "plastic scintillator" [...] {{typically}} {{refers to}} a <b>scintillating</b> <b>material</b> in which the primary fluorescent emitter, called a fluor, is suspended in the base, a solid polymer matrix. While this combination is typically accomplished through {{the dissolution of the}} fluor prior to bulk polymerization, the fluor is sometimes associated with the polymer directly, either covalently or through coordination, {{as is the case with}} many Li6 plastic scintillators. Polyethylene naphthalate has been found to exhibit scintillation by itself without any additives and is expected to replace existing plastic scintillators due to higher performance and lower price. The advantages of plastic scintillators include fairly high light output and a relatively quick signal, with a decay time of 2-4 nanoseconds, but perhaps the biggest advantage of plastic scintillators is their ability to be shaped, through the use of molds or other means, into almost any desired form with what is often a high degree of durability. Plastic scintillators are known to show light output saturation when the energy density is large (Birks' Law).|$|E

40|$|An {{inorganic}} <b>scintillating</b> <b>material</b> plastic {{optical fiber}} (POF) dosimeter for measuring ionizing radiation during radiotherapy applications is reported. It is necessary that an ideal dosimeter exhibits many desirable qualities, including water equivalence, energy independence, reproducibility, dose linearity. There has been much recent research concerning inorganic dosimeters. However, little reference {{has been made to}} date of the depth-dose characteristics of dosimeter materials. In the case of inorganic scintillating materials, they are predominantly non water-equivalent, with their effective atomic weight (Z(eff)) being typically much greater than that of water.

The inorganic-organic composite scintillators have been successfully fabricated and investigated. By leveraging the virtues of inorganics' high stopping power and plastics' ease of fabrication, the low cost composites are potentially serving {{as a candidate for}} the next generation high energy radiation detection materials. New polymer matrix and coupled fluors are developed to obtain plastic <b>scintillating</b> <b>materials,</b> where efficient Foster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) is fulfilled.

Gamma-ray and neutron sensitizers are synthesized and investigated, including metal oxide nanocrystals and organometallics. These sensitizers are soluble in organic solvent, satisfying photophysical requirements for efficient scintillation, and are readily being incorporated into composites. Subsequently, a surface-catalyzed polymerization approach is proposed to fabricate bulk composites via UV curing. The composites are highly transparent at high loading of nanocrystals. Composites scintillators are prepared loaded with different sensitizers and different fluors.
