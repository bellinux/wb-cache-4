40|$|Robotics {{has been}} playing an {{important}} role in modern surgery, especially in procedures that require extreme precision, such as neurosurgery. This paper addresses the challenge of teaching robotics to undergraduate engineering students, through an experiential learning project of robotics fundamentals based on a case study of robot-assisted <b>stereotactic</b> <b>neurosurgery.</b> The project was integrated into the curriculum of a Biomedical Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering program, but can also be integrated in related courses. First, students are given a presentation on the planning and execution of a <b>stereotactic</b> <b>neurosurgery</b> procedure, with special attention being paid to the concepts involved, namely spatial transformations, kinematics, and trajectory planning. Students are then taught to use a robotics simulation tool for robot-assisted <b>stereotactic</b> <b>neurosurgery.</b> They are shown how this {{can be used as a}} specialized control application, providing direct feedback on the robot's motion in a neurosurgery scenario. They are then required to select a robotic manipulator, and to develop and implement its control code to make it perform as a robot assistant in this surgical procedure. Project efficacy was evaluated through student self-report data (with dedicated anonymous surveys) and through the impact on academic and pedagogical results (by means of statistical inference). The results of the student surveys show that the robotics simulator for <b>stereotactic</b> <b>neurosurgery</b> is well suited to its role as an experiential learning tool since it enhances the understanding and application of several robotics concepts in an appealing manner. The positive impact of the project learning experience is supported by a comparison to earlier years of student grades, pass rates, and feedback from an institutional survey.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Parkinsons disease (PD) is {{the second}} most {{prevalent}} neurodegenaritive disease, affecting over 500, 000 people in U. S. A. and about 4 - 5 % of people over 85 [1, 2]. <b>Stereotactic</b> <b>neurosurgery</b> is often used for patients whose condition has deteriorated or who are no longer responsive to drug therapy. One of the critical challenges to neurosurgeons who perform <b>stereotactic</b> <b>neurosurgery</b> in PD patients is locating the target structure within the brain. Modern stereotactic methods for selecting the nominal target location use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a stereotactic frame secured to the patients head such that both the anatomic target and fiducial indicators on the frame can be visualized and registered in an image-processing workstation. However, insufficient image resolution, caused by small mechanical movements of the frame, image distortion, and shifting of the brain within the cranium, prevents precise localization of target structures. ...|$|E

Karger AG, Basel (11 th {{meeting of the}} world society for <b>stereotactic</b> {{and functional}} <b>neurosurgery,</b> October 11 - 15, 1993, Ixtapa, Mexico) At the KUL University of Leuven a workstation for the planning of neurosurgical stereotactic procedures has been developed. Its benefits are illustrated in three exemplary cases. The CT and/or MR images, acquired under stereotactic conditions, are transmitted via a PACS network (picture archiving and communication systems) directly to the stereotactic workstation in the operating theater. Target and entry point can be accurately defined on zoomed images. The trajectory can be checked and modified on all registered data sets and on resliced images along any plane. Maximum intensity projection of magnetic resonance angiography data sets along any arbitrary direction show the relative position of the blood vessels and the trajectory. During the preceding 32 months 29 patients were operated on using the stereotactic workstation. Postoperatively no new neurological deficit was observed {{in any of these}} patients. The workstation improves patient safety and increases the accuracy of neurosurgical stereotactic operations, because it helps the neurosurgeon to avoid blood vessels and/or important functional areas. status: publishe...|$|R
