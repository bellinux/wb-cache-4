The first application is the continuing development of [...] "spy" [...] or reconnaissance satellites which began in the Cold War era, but has progressed significantly since that time. Spy satellites perform a variety of missions such as high resolution photography (IMINT), communications eavesdropping (SIGINT), and covert communications (HUMINT). These tasks are performed on a regular basis both during peacetime and war operations. Satellites are also used by the nuclear states to provide early warning of missile launches, locate nuclear detonations, and detect preparations for otherwise clandestine or surprise nuclear tests (at least those tests or preparations carried out above-ground); this was the case when, in 1998, India and Pakistan both conducted a series of nuclear tests; in addition, a nuclear-detection satellite of the Vela type was also reported to have detected a nuclear detonation in the Indian Ocean in 1978 that was believed to be a South African nuclear test in what was famously called the Vela Incident. Early-warning satellites {{can also be used to}} detect tactical missile launches; this capability was used during Desert Storm when America was able to provide advance warning to Israel of Iraqi SS-1 SCUD missile launches.|$|E

30|$|It is {{currently}} a hot but challenging topic to protect ICH and promote tourist attraction development at the same time, with the digital tourist attraction construction as the core through application of multimedia, internet, database and VR technologies, and so on. In the early 1990 s, Faust and Koller successfully integrated GIS and VR systems, and proposed the concept of VR-GIS. At present, the digital scenic area operation of Celadon Industrial Park is mainly based on VR-GIS platform. It uses VR technology as the front-end to interact with users, and supports GIS spatial data storage, processing, query, analysis, and other functions to establish a comprehensive VR, 3 D GIS, and multidimensional visual information and spatial technical system. The abstract geographic information is easier to perceive with the geographical environment being expressed by 3 D graphics {{through the construction of}} virtual terrain environment. The adoption of multi-sensory channel <b>space</b> <b>sensing</b> technology could create a strong sense of immersive visual perception of Longquan Celadon manufacturing environment and technical process flow, and thus enable unification of tourists’ visual perception of the realistic park space with their logic perception which creates the most memorable memory of the ICH. In the tourism project and development strategy planning, it is advantageous to use digital means in implementing the thought of “protect and utilize,” and find the balance between ICH protection and tourism development.|$|E
30|$|Despite wide-spread {{development}} of SN ideas in recent years, understanding of fundamental performance limits of sensing and communication between sensors {{is still under}} development. One {{of the issues that}} has recently attracted attention in theoretical analysis of sensor networks is the concept of sensor capacity. The sensing capacity was initially introduced for discrete alphabets in applications such as target detection [170] and later extended in [14, 171, 172] to the continuous case. The questions in this area are related to the problem of sampling of sparse signals, [29, 76, 159] and sampling with finite rate of innovation [3, 103]. In the context of the CS, sensing capacity provides bounds on the maximum signal dimension or complexity per sensor measurement that can be recovered to a pre-defined degree of accuracy. Alternatively, it can be interpreted as the minimum number of sensors necessary to monitor a given region to a desired degree of fidelity based on noisy sensor measurements. The inverse of sensing capacity is the compression rate; i.e., the ratio of the number of measurements to the number of signal dimensions which characterizes the minimum rate to which the source can be compressed. As shown in [14], sensing capacity is a function of SNR, the inherent dimensionality of the information <b>space,</b> <b>sensing</b> diversity, and the desired distortion level.|$|E

This program {{grew out of a}} need to develop less expensive, more capable, more flexible, and expandable solutions to the satellite telemetry analysis requirements of the Air Force. Any new system must employ industry standard, open architecture, network and database protocols allowing for easy growth and migration to new technologies, as they become available. Thus, the PC-STS will run on standard personal computers and the Windows NT operating system. The focus of this work and this paper is the Telemetry Server component, and in particular, the custom-built decommutation board. The decommution board will be capable of processing frame formatted and CCSDS packet telemetry. It will be capable of fully decommutating telemetry data, converting raw data to engineering units, and providing this data to the Telemetry Server host. Time tagged engineering units or minor frames of telemetry will be transmitted to the Telemetry Server processor via on-board memory buffers. The decom board uses the PCI bus, programmable DSPs, considerable on-board memory, and a SCSI bus for local archiving. This paper presents the general architecture of the PC-STS, and discusses specific design considerations. These include trade-offs made during the design of the board’s hardware and software, operational specifications, and graphical user interfaces to program, monitor, and control the board...|$|E
40|$|Background: Exergames are {{increasingly}} {{used as an}} exercise intervention to reduce fall risk in elderly. However, few exergames have been designed specifically for elderly, and we lack knowledge about {{the characteristics of the}} movements elicited by exergames and thereby about their potential to train functions important for fall risk reduction. Objective: This study investigates game elements and older players' movement characteristics during stepping exergames in order to inform exergame design for movement quality in the context of fall preventive exercise. Methods: Fourteen senior citizens (mean age 73 years ± 5. 7, range 65 - 85) played 3 stepping exergames in a laboratory. Each of the exergames was described with respect to 7 game elements (physical <b>space,</b> <b>sensing</b> hardware technology, game graphics and sound, model of user, avatar/mapping of movements, game mechanism and game narrative). Five movement characteristics (weight shift; variation in step length, speed, and movement direction; visual independency) were scored on a 5 -point Likert scale based on video observations of each player and each game. Disagreement between raters was resolved by agreement. Differences in scores for the 3 exergames were analyzed with a multivariate one-way ANOVA. Results: The Mole received the highest sum score and the best score on each of the 5 movement characteristics (all p values < 0. 0005). LightRace scored the lowest of the 3 exergames on weight shift and variation in movement direction (both p values < 0. 0005), while DanceDanceRevolution scored lowest on step length variation and visual independency (p < 0. 03 and p < 0. 0005, respectively), and lower than The Mole on speed variation (p < 0. 05). The physical space players used when exergaming and the on-screen representation of the player, affected movement quality positively as indexed by multiple weight shifts and variation in stepping size, direction, and speed. Furthermore, players' movements improved when playing speed-affected game progression and when the game narrative was related to a natural context. Conclusion: Comparing differences in game elements with associated differences in game movement requirements provides valuable insights about how to design for movement quality in exergames. This provided important lessons for the design of exergames for fall-preventive exercise in senior citizens and illustrates the value of including analyses of movement characteristics when designing such exergames. author postprin...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} top level assessment of technology design {{choices for the}} architecture of a space-based information network with shared on-orbit processing. Networking is an efficient method of sharing communications and lowering the cost of communications, providing better interoperability and data integration for multiple satellites. The current space communications architecture sets a critical limitation on the collection of raw data sent to the ground. By introducing powerful space-borne processing, compression of raw data can alleviate the need for expensive and expansive downlinks. Moreover, distribution of processed data directly from space sensors to the end-users may be more easily realized. A space-based information network backbone can act as the transport network for mission satellites as well as enable the concept of decoupled, shared, and perhaps distributed space-borne processing for space-based assets. Optical crosslinks are the enabling technology for creating a cost-effective network capable of supporting high data rates. In this dissertation, the space-based network backbone is designed to meet a number of mission requirements by optimizing over constellation topologies under different traffic models. With high network capacity availability, space-borne processing can be accessible by any mission satellite attached to the network. Space-borne processing capabilities can be enhanced with commercial processors that are tolerant of radiation and replenished periodically (as frequently as every two years). (cont.) Additionally, innovative ways of using a space-based information network can revolutionize satellite communications and space missions. Applications include distributed computing in space, interoperable space communications, multiplatform distributed satellite communications, coherent distributed <b>space</b> <b>sensing,</b> multisensor data fusion, and restoration of disconnected global terrestrial networks after a disaster. Lastly, the consolidation of all the different communications assets into a horizontally integrated space-based network infrastructure calls for a space-based network backbone to be designed with a generic nature. A coherent infrastructure can satisfy the goals of interoperability, flexibility, scalability, and allows the system to be evolutionary. This transformational vision of a generic space-based information network allows for growth to accommodate civilian demands, lowers the price of entry for the commercial sector, and makes way for innovation to enhance and provide additional value to military systems. by Serena Chan.

40|$|ABSTRACT. An {{effective}} corn {{plant population}} and <b>spacing</b> <b>sensing</b> system {{may provide a}} key layer of field variability information useful for crop management. An algorithm was developed to count corn plants and to estimate plant location and intra−row spacing in segmented images of 6. 1 −m (20 −ft) long row sections. Images were scanned to detect and determine the boundaries of top projected corn plant canopy objects using a chain code methodology. Plant objects were fused together based on a multi−step process that took into account the spatial structure of the crop row. Position, roundness, and area of plant canopies were used to distinguish between corn plants and weeds. Estimates of plant counts in row sections were compared with manual counts across three growth stages, three populations, and three tillage treatments. Overall, the system estimated the number of plants with an RMSE of 1. 49 plants per row section, which corresponds to 6. 2 % RMSE or 3210 plants/ha (1300 plants/acre). No evidence of significant differences in mean plant spacing estimates was detected although significant, albeit small, increases in spacing variance were detected.
