According to a recent study by International Data Corporation, pub- lishers of EDP Industry Report, worldwide shipments of minicomputers will jump almost 50 percent this year, to a shipped value of $ 835 million. 1 By 1977, minis should represent a $ 2. 5 billion business. Some promising fields are: business and banking, where mini-based point-of-sale and accounting systems are just beginning to tap the potential of autotransaction; support of data entry systems and telecommunications networks, where minis are used for message-switching; automated manufacturing, where minis are used in closed-loop systems; and customized packages that give sophisticated users clusters of inexpensive minis for on-line jobs that once required large machines. Minis are being shipped at a rate of 2, 800 per month, and the installed population will outnumber general-purpose computers before the end of 1974. IDC expects that within five years the mini shipment rate will be 10, 000 per month. The marketplace for minis is diffused, fragmented, and hard to define. Most manufacturers sell their machines as tools most minis are dedicated to a single function. Currently, 58 percent of minis and 96 percent of mini-peripheralsproduced in the United States go to OEM sup- pliers. Potential end-users of minis are attracted by their increasing ease of use, even more than by their declining prices. Larger memories allow program- ming in higher level languages, rather than in machine languages. For example, Microdata has just announced a new <b>small</b> <b>business</b> <b>system</b> programmable in simple English sentences. Raytheon has announced a new mini that will be available on a rental basis, and a new mini array processor ($ 57, 000) that can add two arrays of more than 16, 000 numbers each into a third array, from a single instruction, and twenty times faster than the CPU could do the job under standard program control. The mini market currently supports at least fifty viable suppliers. IBM has not really entered the mini market, but rumors persist of a "System/ 2. " If it ever appears, a true IBM minicomputer could change the shape of the industry. An important educational application involves the effective use of mini- computers to handle the acquisition and circulation systems in university libraries. The study of minicomputers and their successful application to library data processing should certainly include a review of the Singer Company's System 10 minicomputer 2 and point of transaction terminal system in use at McKeldin Library at the University of Maryland. We feel that we have taken an innovative approach to the library's biggest headache effective circulation control without impairing service to our students, faculty or staff. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E

Early hobby microcomputer systems such as the Altair 8800 and Apple I introduced around 1975 marked the release of low-cost 8-bit processor chips, which had sufficient computing power to {{be of interest to}} hobby and experimental users. By 1977 pre-assembled systems such as the Apple II, Commodore PET, and TRS-80 (later dubbed the [...] "1977 Trinity" [...] by Byte Magazine) began the era of mass-market home computers; much less effort was required to obtain an operating computer, and applications such as games, word processing, and spreadsheets began to proliferate. Distinct from computers used in homes, <b>small</b> <b>business</b> <b>systems</b> were typically based on CP/M, until IBM introduced the IBM-PC, which was quickly adopted. The PC was heavily cloned, leading to mass production and consequent cost reduction throughout the 1980s.

40|$|This study {{compared}} the turnover tax and <b>small</b> <b>business</b> corporation tax <b>systems</b> in South Africa as applicable to micro and <b>small</b> <b>businesses.</b> Misinformed {{perceptions of the}} turnover tax system were the motivation for this study. A three phase approach was adopted to conduct this study, the phases being literature review, in-depth face-to-face interviews and quantitative analysis of financial statements which {{are referred to as}} case studies. The tax liability was calculated for each of the thirty cases and thereafter a comparative analysis was performed to establish the most beneficial tax system for each case study. The findings for year one revealed that the <b>small</b> <b>business</b> corporation tax <b>system</b> was the most beneficial tax system for fifteen of the thirty cases and turnover tax for the other fifteen cases. Over an average of five years, fourteen cases benefited from the <b>small</b> <b>business</b> corporation tax <b>system</b> and sixteen from turnover tax. There were a number of significant reasons why the above mentioned tax systems were appropriate for each of the thirty cases, one of which being, the type of business or industry where the case is located.

40|$|The {{area of the}} North-Hungarian Region is 13, 429 km 2, {{which is}} 14. 4 % of the country’s territory. In terms of area and {{population}} the region lies in fourth place in Hungary. The region is remarkable for the beauty of its landscapes, which are rich in untouched natural values with its significant ecological potential. Among its natural treasures we can find medicinal, thermal and mineral water springs. The wine producing regions of Eger and GyÃ¶ngyÃ¶s are well known in Europe, while Tokaj is world famous. Significant problems in the North-Hungarian Region are unemployment exceeding the national average, caused by adaptation and modernisation crises, low-level employment, and the concentrated appearance of underdeveloped settlements and population groups. As <b>small</b> <b>businesses</b> represent an outstanding employment ratio in the region - about 70 % - socio-economic development is not possible without increasing the number and competitiveness of <b>small</b> <b>businesses.</b> In our research we looked for an answer to what the necessary conditions are for this. Recommendations for increasing the competitiveness of <b>small</b> <b>businesses</b> in the North-Hungarian Region: â€¢ <b>Small</b> <b>businesses</b> need to improve {{in the area of}} supplier activity, quality, information and confidence. â€¢ <b>Small</b> <b>businesses</b> must improve precision, supplier discipline and quality. â€¢ When establishing co-operation and partnership relations the greatest preventative factor is lack of confidence. Most of the businesses are afraid of transferring their own knowledge and information; they are ready to accept every benefit of co-operation but without its risks. â€¢ Higher-level co-operation will be necessary among <b>small</b> <b>businesses,</b> supporting organisations, chambers and municipalities. â€¢ Efficient support must be given to the participation of <b>small</b> <b>businesses</b> in the network economy and to the establishment of small businesses’ common efforts. â€¢ Common large-scale purchasing and selling by <b>small</b> <b>businesses</b> must be efficiently supported. â€¢ The changing of small business/managerial mentality needs to be supported in the following areas: - problem solving ability - business sense - high-level professional knowledge - organising ability - practise-focusing - high-level communications kills- managerial knowledge - co-operation ability - risk taking ability - analysing ability - idea representing ability - computer skills â€¢ Efficient, target-oriented training and extension training, needs to be organised for managers and employees of <b>small</b> <b>businesses.</b> â€¢ Transparent, clear legal frameworks must be established. â€¢ Tax burdens should be reduced, especially those exerted on labour. â€¢ Efficient capital search and credit programmes are needed for <b>small</b> <b>businesses.</b> â€¢ An efficient <b>small</b> <b>business</b> relations <b>system</b> needs to be created with research sites and higher-education institutes using the latest R&D results. â€¢ Efficient support must be given to <b>small</b> <b>businesses</b> to access new markets. â€¢ The establishment and efficient operation of the Regional <b>Small</b> <b>Businesses</b> Support <b>System</b> (REKTÃR), planned and worked out by ourselves, would basically help with <b>small</b> <b>business</b> competitiveness.

In addition, other reasons managers of <b>small</b> <b>businesses</b> may wish not to obtain a computer for their companies are evaluated.
