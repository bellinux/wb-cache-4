40|$|The {{role played}} by the micro and small {{enterprises}} (MSE) sector has increasingly been recognized and appreciated not only in the developing but also the developed countries globally. This appreciation has largely been due to the contribution of the MSE sector to economic development particularly in employment creation. Kenyan small and medium sized enterprises, however, are still not fully competitive, especially in foreign markets which require efficient production, good management structures, market capabilities, product and service development that meets international standards and strong networks in conducting business operations. Despite the importance of export to economic development among economies there is little attention has been given to the factors that influence <b>SMEs</b> <b>participation</b> in export trade. This study sought to investigate factors affecting participation of small medium enterprises (SMEs) in export trade in Kenya with focus to manufacturing SMEs in Nairobi County. The study aimed to investigate whether firm characteristics, skill workforce, government assistance and foreign investment influence <b>SMEs</b> <b>participation</b> in export trade in Kenya. The target population of this study was manufacturing SMEs registered with KRA. The study relied mostly on primary data sources. The study employed a stratified simple random sampling technique in coming up with a sample size of 114 respondents. The study generated both qualitative and quantitative data where quantitative data was coded and entered into SPSS and analyzed using descriptive statistics...|$|E
40|$|Ghana started {{commercial}} oil production in 2010 {{and as part}} of strategies to facilitate linkages between {{the oil and gas industry}} and the Ghanaian economy, a local content law was passed in 2013. This PhD thesis examines whether and how Ghana’s local content law enhances the opportunities for local participation in the petroleum sector. With a focus on Ghanaian SMEs’ and drawing on relational perspectives in geography that emphasise the embeddedness of economic action, the thesis highlights the complex social processes that shape the impacts of natural resources extraction on society. The thesis examines Ghanaian entrepreneurs’ strategies of drawing on networks to acquire information, build trust and mobilise financial capital in their attempt to gain entry and participate in the oil and gas industry. The study argues that the social and economic capitals relevant for local entrepreneurial activities in the oil industry are relatively inaccessible for SMEs. The thesis also explores the ways in which a state-led Enterprise Development Centre (EDC) enhances the opportunities for SMEs’ participation in the oil industry. While the EDC enhances the capacities of SMEs through training, this study contends that the benefits of the EDC in terms of promoting SMEs’ participation in the oil industry are limited. With emphasis on the micro-mechanisms of power embedded in the techniques and practices of MNCs, the state and local companies, the thesis examines the emerging relations of power between actors and highlights how these influence the opportunities for <b>SMEs</b> <b>participation</b> in the oil and gas sector. Through extensive fieldwork conducted in Ghana’s oil industry over a period of three years, the study concludes that Ghana’s local content law is largely beneficial to local elites and does not stimulate broad-based social and economic benefits. The case studies of Ghana entrepreneurial activities show how embedded resources and practices of actors shape local <b>SMEs</b> <b>participation</b> in the oil and gas industry. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical analysis {{of small and}} medium enterprise (<b>SME)</b> <b>participation</b> in production networks. It gauges firm characteristic determinants of <b>SME</b> <b>participation</b> in production networks. The empirical investigation utilizes results obtained from an ERIA Survey on <b>SME</b> <b>Participation</b> in Production Networks, conducted over a three month period at the end 2009 in most ASEAN countries (i. e., Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos PDR) and China. The results suggest that productivity, foreign ownership, financial characteristics, innovation efforts, and managerial/entrepreneurial attitudes are the important firm characteristics that determine <b>SME</b> <b>participation</b> in production networks. The paper extends the analysis to identify the determinants that allow SMEs to move from low to high quality or value adding participation in production networks. The results suggest that size, productivity, foreign ownership, and, to some extent, innovation efforts and managerial attitudes, are the important firm characteristics needed by SMEs to upgrade their positions in production networks. The finding suggests that SMEs really exploit competitiveness from economies of scale only when {{they are able to}} engage in production networks. ...|$|R

Previous research findings identifying influences on <b>SME</b> <b>participation</b> in training have been used as an analytical framework to examine an experience of training design and delivery in practice. Discussion and analysis of project data within the framework above identifies support for some of the relationships between <b>SME</b> <b>participation</b> and these influences. SMEs have taken up the training, participation grew over time, and positive feedback was received.

40|$|Small {{and medium}} {{enterprises}} (<b>SMEs)</b> <b>participation</b> in the Nigerian {{oil and gas}} industry has remained low despite their importance in income generation, employment, local capacity building, and poverty eradication. The purpose of this multiple case study was to explore the strategies SME owners use to improve profitability in the Nigerian {{oil and gas industry}}. The target population consisted of 5 business owners who had successfully managed SMEs in Warri, Delta State, Nigeria for more than 5 years. The resource-based view and Porter 2 ̆ 7 s 5 forces of competition served as the conceptual framework for the study. Data collection was through semistructured interviews and review of company documents to triangulate the data. Data analysis included transcription, coding, querying, interpreting and reporting the themes, and the use of member checking strengthened the trustworthiness of interpretations. Findings suggested themes of low-cost strategy, knowledge of the business environment, competent personnel, collaborative partnerships, integrity, and financial management. These findings may contribute to positive social change because SME business leaders could use low-cost strategies, hire competent personnel, collaborate with other partners, and demonstrate integrity in financial management. Doing so may improve profitability, generate employment, reduce poverty, and enhance standards of living...|$|E
40|$|For both {{developing}} and developed countries, small and medium scale firms play {{important roles in}} the process of industrialization and economic growth. Apart from increasing per capita income and output, Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) create employment opportunities, enhance regional economic balance through industrial dispersal and generally promote effective resource utilization considered critical to engineering economic development and growth. The development of SMEs is seen as accelerating the achievement of wider economic and socio-economic objectives, including poverty alleviation. Unleashing its influence on the way traditional business is conducted hitherto is the phenomenon of electronic commerce (e-commerce). The Internet through its reduction in distance-related costs is seen by many as a potential source of economic revitalization. This Internet economy has continued to grow at an unprecedented rate. Thus, this paper focused on the extent of Nigerian’s <b>SMEs</b> <b>participation</b> in this Internet economy.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore the barriers and opportunities of public procurement that SMEs and public purchasers experience. A plan of action for public purchasers and SMEs to commonly increase <b>SMEs</b> <b>participation</b> in public procurement is formulated based on the findings. Method: Qualitative interviews with both public purchasers and representatives for local SMEs are performed to answer the research question of how local SMEs and public procurement divisions jointly can increase <b>SMEs</b> <b>participation</b> in public procurement. Findings: The results are presented separately for public purchasers and SMEs, but the picture they are painting are coherent. Both procurers and SMEs testify to a difficult regulatory framework that is very resource intensive. The procurers perceive multiple benefits when sourcing from local SMEs, but the SMEs experience is that factors such as service and quality seldom is taken into consideration in public procurements. Procurers and SMEs both declare that procurement processes are of poor quality, where the procurers stresses the lack of resources needed and SMEs testify to poorly written tender documentations and a lack of knowledge about the good or the service that is the subject to the procurement. Conclusions: Previous studies have stated that the problems in public procurement experienced by SMEs that were brought to attention twenty years ago are still present. The findings of this study are coherent with that statement, since many of the experienced barriers and opportunities that are articulated by procurers and SMEs are consistent with previous research. The practical contribution of this study consists of a plan of action to enhance cooperation between municipalities and SMEs with the aim to increase local <b>SMEs</b> <b>participation</b> in public procurement. The plan of action is divided in three parts; to initiate a local cooperation, to update the local policy of public procurement and to evaluate the way public procurement is organized.

In this paper, I use data from Swedish public procurement auctions for internal regular cleaning service contracts to study the effect of contract size and number of contracts on <b>SME</b> <b>participation</b> and the probability of submitting the winning bid. I found that <b>SME</b> <b>participation</b> is negatively related to both contract size and the number of contracts in the procurement. A possible interpretation is that reduced contract size in order to stimulate <b>SME</b> <b>participation</b> is counteracted by reduced incentives for them to enter into procurements with multiple contracts.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the readiness factors of SMEs to participate in workforce skills development. Many changes have occurred regarding the workforce skills needed in the workplace operation, thus forcing the organizations to emphasize on knowledge-based workforce. Workforce needs to acquire new skills to be competitive and ready to accept the current and upcoming changes. SMEs needs to involve in on-going training of their workforce in order to guarantee its skills resources and challenges to be faced, due to the increases of competitiveness and technology advancement. Questionnaire were distributed to 200 employees of SMEs in the food manufacturing sector in Batu Pahat, Johor. The preliminary analysis of the questionnaires showed that the item regarding mutual trust and respect with mean score of 4. 12 is the most dominant factor of workforce readiness to participate in skills development, thus indicate the high central of tendency towards readiness of participation. Whilst, the overall outcome for all the readiness factors regarding <b>SMEs</b> <b>participation</b> in employees skills development showed high central of tendency with mean range from 3. 89 - 4. 12.

40|$|The {{promotion}} {{of the value of}} training amongst SMEs is a challenging task. The cost associated with training as well as the time taken-out for attending courses are often seen as key barriers for <b>SMEs</b> <b>participation</b> in training. In 2008, the European Social Fund (ESF) provided training grants for SMEs, regardless of their type of activity, in Aberdeenshire to promote participation in training. The training grants are used to develop and deliver a series of short training courses that are aimed at addressing SMEs training needs. This paper sets out an evaluation framework for the training offered (as a result of the grants) in light of the Return-On-Investment (ROI) methodology. The evaluation of training will address levels 1 and 2 out of the five levels in the ROI methodology, namely: perceived value of the course and learning achieved as a result of attending the course. A questionnaire was designed and tested in order to collect data at levels 1 and 2. However, it is envisaged that evaluation at levels 3 - 5 (results in terms of business performance and ROI) will require the tracking of participants through a 'unique identifier ' in order to establish the actual contribution of the training courses to a business. It is argued that the adoption of a structured approach for the evaluation of training, namely ROI methodology, is paramount if SMEs are to conceive the impact of training. It is concluded that for SMEs to participate in training, there should be a focus on providing evidence on its potential value and relevance to their business activity. Until this happens, the traditionally low level of participation in training by SMEs will continue, irrespective of it being offered for free through training grants...|$|E

To survive in an increasingly competitive environment requires a new growth paradigm and business strategy for SMEs that focuses upon knowledge and skill acquisition, technology upgrading, innovation and wealth creation.

40|$|In Paper [I], we {{theoretically}} assess green {{public procurement}} (GPP) as an environmental policy instrument {{and its ability to}} lead to the achievement of environmental objectives. Central to our analysis {{is the extent to which}} polluting firms choose to adapt to the public sector's environmental requirements and to invest in greener technologies. Our main finding is that the potential of GPP to function as an objective-effective instrument of environmental policy is limited and can actually be counterproductive. From an environmental policy point of view, it is crucial that GPP aims for environmental standards beyond just the technology of the polluting firms and that it is designed with reference to defined environmental objectives. In Paper [II], we use data on Swedish public procurement auctions for internal regular cleaning service contracts to provide novel empirical evidence regarding GPP and its effect on the potential suppliers' decision to submit a bid and their probability of being qualified for supplier selection. We find only a weak effect on supplier behavior, and this suggests that GPP, as used in practice, does not live up to its political expectations. However, several environmental criteria appear to be associated with increased complexity, as indicated by the reduced probability of a bid being qualified in the post-qualification process. As such, GPP appears to have limited or no potential to function as an environmental policy instrument. In Paper [III], I examine how GPP is organized in Sweden and how the potential suppliers respond to varying buyer market shares using data on Swedish public procurement auctions for internal regular cleaning service contracts. The level of GPP stringency is found to vary systematically across authority types, buyer market share, and political coalition in the relevant council or in Parliament. The results also indicate quite a substantial dispersion in GPP stringency, suggesting a low degree of coordination among contracting authorities when implementing the policy. After controlling for GPP stringency and other covariates, increased buyer market share is associated with a significant increase in the probability of potential suppliers submitting a bid. The European Commission encourages public authorities to split procurement contracts into multiple contracts in order to increase the competiveness of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). In Paper [IV], I use data from Swedish public procurement auctions for internal regular cleaning service contracts to study the effect of contract size and number of contracts on <b>SME</b> <b>participation</b> and probability of winning. The results indicate that <b>SME</b> <b>participation</b> is negatively related to both contract size and the number of contracts in the procurement. A possible interpretation is that reduced contract size in order to stimulate <b>SME</b> <b>participation</b> is counteracted by reduced incentives for them to enter into procurements with multiple contracts. Medium-sized firms are also more successful when bidding for smaller contracts relative to large firms. Nevertheless, the results indicate that the award rate for SMEs is positively correlated with the number of contracts in the procurement.

Relational capability does not. However, procedural and relational capability each has a significant and positive effect on contract win-ratio and percentage of total revenue derived from public contracts. For SMEs, these findings underline the importance of investing in tendering skills and devising buyer engagement strategies.

The most substantive and pervasive of these models has been the development of global value chains or production networks.

Despite the community development motivation, a major argument for e-marketplace development being put forward is the economic one and this has contributed to a narrow view of the e-marketplace concept and one, which for the time being at least, is likely to restrict its impact. Government sponsored e-marketplaces should consider the value of on-line business networks to share knowledge and potentially increase levels of innovation. The findings have implications for government sponsored e-marketplace initiatives around the world...|$|R
40|$|In Bangladesh, SMEs {{are very}} {{important}} players in the economy. About 90 per cent of all industrial units in Bangladesh are SMEs, which generate some 25 per cent {{of the gross domestic}} product (GDP), employ about 31 million people and provide 75 per cent of household income. There is no denying that SMEs act as the driver of the economy and {{are very important}} for national economic and social development. They serve as employers creating new jobs and providers of products for daily needs. They also act as stewards over employees and the community. However, SMEs in developing and least developed countries face considerable barriers in running their businesses and are often constrained financially and technologically. This includes inadequate and/or complex sets of policies by the respective governments. Such impediments largely contribute to the under-involvement of SMEs in international markets. This is where the nature and extent of <b>SME</b> <b>participation</b> in the global trading system needs to be highlighted. Trade facilitation is thus a crucial factor in providing SMEs with access to global markets. Trade facilitation, ICT, IT, SMEs, international trade, Bangladesh...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the agent-based model INFSO-SKIN, which provides ex-ante evaluation of possible funding policies in Horizon 2020 for the European Commission’s DG Information Society and Media (DG INFSO). Informed {{by a large}} dataset recording the details of funded projects, the simulation model is set up to reproduce and assess the funding strategies, the funded organisations and projects, and the resulting network structures of the Commission’s Framework 7 (FP 7) programme. To address the evaluative questions of DG INFSO, this model, extrapolated into the future without any policy changes, is taken as an evidence-based benchmark for further experiments. Against this baseline scenario the following example policy changes are tested: (i) What if there were changes to the thematic scope of the programme? (ii) What if there were changes to the instruments of funding? (iii) What if there were changes to the overall amount of programme funding? (iv) What if there were changes to increase Small and Medium Enterprise (<b>SME)</b> <b>participation?</b> The results of these simulation experiments reveal some likely scenarios as policy options for Horizon 2020. The paper thus demonstrates that realistic modelling with a close data-to-model link can directly provide policy advice...|$|R
40|$|The digital {{business}} ecosystem (DBE) is an infrastructure {{that is being}} designed to support the flexible development and composition of business services. Operating under open source licensing and designed according to open standards principles, the DBE is currently funded by the European Commission. The issue facing DBE project partners who include research institutions, large technology companies and {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) is how to sustain the momentum of the project once funding ceases. Responsibility for maintaining the infrastructure and ensuring that it remains open will fall to a governing body. However, the legal and organisational requirements of that body have yet to be defined. This paper provides details of research in progress which is being carried out into questions of governance and sustainability of the DBE infrastructure. Data collection will {{take the form of a}} ground-up process of consultation in which participating SMEs will be asked for their views on what form of governance the nascent DBE community should adopt. Early feedback suggests three areas of governance will take precedence during this transition phase: the constitution of a governing body; governance necessary to maintain the DBE infrastructure; and governance to support <b>SME</b> <b>participation.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|The public {{procurement}} {{market in the}} EU is worth around one-sixth of the total GDP of the EU. This huge market should be accessible to all competitors but the procedures used in many tenders {{have the effect of}} disadvantaging SMEs over larger competitors. This situation was intended to be improved with the implementation in member states of the 2004 directives reforming {{public procurement}} rules. A significant portion of the wide range of supplies, services and works required by public organisations are well within the scope of SMEs. The many barriers which discourage SMEs from engaging with public procurement have led the EU to take positive action to support them. The 2004 directives were designed to reduce administrative burdens and costs of tendering and to make procurement systems more transparent and easier to use especially through a simplified e-tendering procedure. This paper examines EU policies and strategies designed to promote <b>SME</b> <b>participation</b> in public procurement and how they are implemented at national and local level in the UK and other member states. The aim of the study is to evaluate whether the efforts being made by the EU and member states will be effective in promoting wider access to public procurement by SMEs operating in the construction industry sector...|$|R
