40|$|In {{this paper}} the noise {{propagation}} through a solid medium {{is considered to}} study how {{the parameters of the}} statistical model change. In particular the external and internal sound fields of a box are taken into account. It is experimentally shown that the variance of the real and the imaginary parts of the external <b>stationary</b> <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> change differently while going through the box walls. The generalized Rayleigh distribution is shown to be more suitable to model the noise inside the cavity instead of the classical Rayleigh distribution. Starting from this outcome it has been studied how this noise affects a signal. It is known that a signal modulus affected by <b>stationary</b> <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> can be described by using the Rice distribution if the real and imaginary parts of the noise are statistically independent and identically distributed with zero mean and equal variances. Otherwise the less popular generalized Rice distribution must be used. The main differences of using the Rice or the generalized Rice distributions are shown by considering phasors both with constant and variable phases. In this paper it is shown that the bias estimation depends on the phase of the phasor if the variances of the real and imaginary parts are different and a numerical quantification is given. The attained results are useful when performing measurements of the sound pressure field due to a sound source inside a cavity affected by external noise...|$|E

Long duration sounds were presented to listeners who had to continuously assess their unpleasantness by moving a cursor sliding along a five-levels scale (from 'not at all unpleasant' to 'extremely unpleasant'). A second experiment, using a paired comparison procedure, gave a reference of the unpleasantness of the three sounds and the background noise used to synthesize the whole stimuli.

30|$|A {{widely used}} method for image restoration, {{relevant}} to the current paper, is the classic Wiener filter [3]. The standard Wiener filter is a linear space-invariant filter designed to minimize mean squared error (MSE) between the desired signal and estimate, assuming <b>stationary</b> <b>random</b> signals and <b>noise.</b> It {{is important to note}} that there are many disparate variations of Wiener filters. These include finite impulse response, infinite impulse response, transform-domain, and spatially adaptive methods. Within each of these categories, a wide variety of statistical models may be employed. Some statistical models are very simple, such as the popular constant noise-to-signal power spectral density model, and others are far more complex. In the case of the empirical Wiener filter [4], no explicit statistical model is used at all. Rather, a pilot or prototype estimate is used in lieu of a parametric statistical model. While all of these methods may go by the name of ‘Wiener filter’, they can be quite different in their character.|$|R
40|$|Envelope {{analysis}} {{is a widely}} used method for bearing fault detection. To obtain high detection accuracy, {{it is critical to}} select an optimal narrowband for envelope demodulation. Fast Kurtogram is an effective method for optimal narrowband selection. However, fast Kurtogram is not sufficiently robust because it is very sensitive to random noise and large aperiodic impulses which normally exist in practical application. To achieve the purpose of denoising and frequency band optimization, this paper proposes a new fault detector based on modulation signal bispectrum analysis (MSB) for bearing fault detection. As MSB results highlight the modulation effects by suppressing <b>stationary</b> <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> and discrete aperiodic impulses, the detector developed using high magnitudes of MSB can provide optimal frequency bands for fault detection straightforward.

To obtain high detection accuracy, {{it is critical to}} determine an optimal frequency narrowband for the envelope demodulation. However, many of the schemes which are used for the narrowband selection, such as the kurtogram, can potentially produce poor detection results because they are sensitive to random noise and aperiodic impulses which normally occur in practical applications. To achieve the purposes of denoising and frequency band optimisation, this keynote presents a modulation signal bispectrum (MSB) based robust detector for bearing fault detection. Because of its inherent noise suppression capability, the MSB allows effective suppression of both the <b>stationary</b> <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> and discrete aperiodic noise. The high magnitude features that result from the use of the MSB also enhance the modulation effects of a bearing fault and can be used to provide optimal frequency bands for fault detection.

40|$|Abstract. We obtain {{conditions}} for L 2 and strong {{consistency of the}} least square estimators of the coefficients in a multi-linear regression model with a <b>stationary</b> <b>random</b> <b>noise.</b> For given non-random regressors, we obtain conditions which ensure L 2 -consistency for all wide sense stationary noise sequences with spectral measure in a given class. The condition for the class of all noises with continuous (i. e., atomless) spectral measures yields also Lp-consistency when the noise is strict sense stationary with continuous spectrum and finite absolute pth moment, p ≥ 1 (even without finite variance). When the spectral measure of the noise is not continuous, {{we assume that the}} non-random regressors are Hartman almost periodic, and obtain a spectral condition for L 2 -consistency. An additional assumption on the regressors yields strong consistency for strictly stationary noise sequences. We also treat the case when the regressors are random sequences, with trends having some good averaging properties and with additive stationary ergodic random fluctuations independent of the noise. When the noise and the fluctuations have disjoint point spectra and the noise is strict sense stationary, we obtain strong consistency of the LSE. The results are applied to amplitude estimation in sums of harmonic signals with known frequencies. 1. Introduction. W...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper first {{provides}} statistical {{properties of}} wavelet operators when the observation {{model can be}} seen as the product of a deterministic piece-wise regular function (signal) and a <b>stationary</b> <b>random</b> field (<b>noise).</b> This multiplicative observation model is analyzed in two standard frameworks by considering either (1) a direct wavelet transform of the model or (2) a log-transform of the model prior to wavelet decomposition. The paper shows that, in Framework (1), wavelet coefficients of the time series are affected by intricate correlation structures which blur signal singularities. Framework (2) is shown to be associated with a multiplicative (or geometric) wavelet transform and the multiplicative interactions between wavelets and the model highlight both sparsity of signal changes near singularities (dominant coefficients) and decorre-lation of speckle wavelet coefficients. The paper then derives that, for time series of synthetic aperture radar data, geometric wavelets represent a more intuitive and relevant framework for the analysis of smooth earth fields observed in the presence of speckle. From this analysis, the paper proposes a fast-and-concise geometric wavelet based method for joint change detection and regularization of synthetic aperture radar image time series. In this method, geometric wavelet details are first computed with respect to the temporal axis in order to derive generalized-ratio change-images from the time series. The changes are then enhanced and speckle is attenuated by using spatial block sigmoid shrinkage. Finally, a regularized time series is reconstructed from the sigmoid shrunken change-images.

The parameters of MTMD that are optimized include the damping ratio, the tuning frequency ratio and the frequency bandwidth of the MTMD system. The optimum parameters of the MTMD system and corresponding effectiveness are obtained for different damping ratios of the main structure and mass ratios of the MTMD system. In addition, the effectiveness of an optimally designed MTMD system is {{compared with that of}} an optimum single tuned mass damper.
