500|$|In its {{original}} American NBC broadcast on January 21, 2010, [...] "Leslie's House" [...] {{was seen by}} 4.35 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. It was a more than five percent drop in viewership from the previous week's episode, [...] "The Set Up". [...] "Leslie's House" [...] drew a 2.0 rating/5 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49. The episode received generally positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star-Ledger, said the episode was very funny and farcical, but grounded in reality enough {{to keep it from}} being too unbelievable or over-the-top.

[...] Kandell <b>said</b> <b>Mark</b> accepting a buyout {{felt like a}} [...] "perfectly sensible and organic to the story" [...] way to remove the character from the series, and described the ending scene with Ron and Wendy as an effective cliffhanger building up to the third season. Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic said, [...] "We can sum up the episode in one word: perfection." [...] Hochberger praised the characterization in the script, and particularly enjoyed that the former pit, a long-time device for the series, {{was used for the}} concert and Mark's departure. CraveOnline writer Blair Marnell described [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] {{as one of the best}} episodes of the series. He praised the writing, particularly the jokes involving Andy and Ron's love of budget cuts, but said Leslie's character ultimately carried the story and had the best jokes. Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said the episode [...] "end an already phenomenal season on a high note" [...] and said she loved the symmetry of the finale. Gallagher particularly praised Scott's new character, claiming [...] "his bruised idealism is a nice match for Leslie's blind idealism", but said Lowe's character continued to lack depth, and described the April and Andy subplot as predictable.|$|E

Her MTV VJ job allowed her to pursue other media career opportunities, and eventually led to her being cast as Peyton.

2500|$|In September 2012 the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) accused Walgreens of {{endangering}} {{public safety}} and barred the company from shipping oxycodone and other controlled drugs from its Jupiter, Florida, distribution center. The DEA said that Walgreens failed to maintain proper controls to ensure it didn't dispense drugs to addicts and drug dealers. [...] The DEA also said that six of Walgreens' Florida pharmacies ordered in excess of a million oxycodone pills a year.

[...] Another example was a Walgreens pharmacy located in Hudson, Fla., a town of 34,000 people near Clearwater, that purchased 2.2 million pills in 2011, the DEA said.
