40|$|This {{analytical}} {{study examined}} {{the potential benefits of}} applying two embodiments of adaptive lighting to the U. S. and European low-beam patterns: curve lighting that involves shifting the beam horizontally into the curve, and motorway lighting that involves shifting the beam vertically upward. The curve lighting simulations paired 80 -m radius left and right curves with a horizontal beam shift of 15 °, and 240 -m radius curves with a shift of 10 °. The motorway lighting simulations involved upward aim shifts of 0. 25 ° and 0. 5 °. For both curve and motorway lighting, changes in both visibility and glare illuminance were considered. Marketweighted model year 2000 U. S. and <b>European</b> <b>beam</b> patterns were used. We conclude that curve lighting, as simulated here, would substantially improve seeing performance on curves for both types of beams. On left curves (but not on right curves) there would be an increase in disability glare for oncoming traffic. No major discomfort glare problems would be expected. Although the shifted U. S. beams were found to perform slightly better overall than the shifted <b>European</b> <b>beams,</b> the main difference in performance is between the shifted and nominally aimed beams. Motorway lighting, as simulated here, would also substantially improve seeing performance, with the benefits already present at an upward shift of 0. 25 °. Because the increases in glare illuminance would be minor, and because motorways often incorporate median barriers or wide separations between lanes of opposing traffic, we do not expect substantial problems with increased glare. The <b>European</b> <b>beams</b> benefit more from this embodiment of motorway lighting than do the U. S. beams. (This is the case because under nominal aim the <b>European</b> <b>beams</b> provide less visibility illuminance and their vertical gradient is steeper.) Nevertheless, the nominally aimed U. S. beams tend to outperform the <b>European</b> <b>beams</b> shifted upward 0. 25 °...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is analysing of the calculating results of theoretical values of the beam flexure by the Ukrainian National <b>Standard,</b> <b>European</b> <b>Standard</b> and by the experimental data of concrete beams testing. The results of the experimental investigations of flexures of the reinforced concrete beams are shown. The theoretical comparison of the flexures of the reinforced concrete beams according to the Ukrainian National <b>Standard</b> and <b>European</b> <b>Standard</b> is done. It was proved that the flexures by these methods have an identical convergence with experimental data. The algorithm for determining deformations of materials at the known bending moments by using the method of simple iteration or method of successive approximations is proposed. The solution of this problem allows practical use of the National <b>Standard</b> and <b>European</b> <b>Standard</b> for calculating flexures.

There are still some phonological differences affected by Cantonese phonology made by those who speak Portuguese as a second language, such as a non-rhotic accent: final [...] in infinitive verbs is dropped (cf. [...] to eat, [...] to sleep, but not [...] sea), as in African Portuguese and most Brazilian speakers, and [...] is devoiced to , a trait almost unique to Macau. These phonological differences do not apply to Chinese who have higher education in Portuguese.|$|R
