25|$|The Hongwu Emperor was {{wary of the}} {{political}} and social consequences that the maritime commerce could bring, so he sought to restrain it by outlawing private maritime trade. This policy continued well into the Yongle Emperor's reign. However, the Yongle Emperor himself aimed at consolidating imperial control over the maritime commerce, stopping the coastal criminality and disorder, providing employment for mariners and entrepreneurs, exporting Chinese products to foreign markets, importing desired goods for Chinese consumers, extending the tributary system, and displaying imperial majesty to the seas. The voyages functioned as trade commissions in the government's attempts of regulating the private maritime commerce by establishing an imperial monopoly over it and incorporate it into the tributary system. There was seemingly <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> idea about a foreign policy comprising an extended foreign trade, which came to be supported by a heavy military naval presence and a cultivation of shared interests with local allies.|$|E
2500|$|Most Bond {{girls are}} {{apparently}} (and sometimes expressly) sexually {{experienced by the}} time they meet Bond. Quite often those previous experiences have not been positive, and many Bond girls have had sexual violence inflicted on them in the past which has caused them to feel alienated from all men—until Bond comes along. Tiffany Case was gang-raped as a teenager; Honey Ryder, too, was beaten and raped as a teenager by a drunken acquaintance. Pussy Galore was sexually abused at age 12 by her uncle. While there is no such clear-cut trauma in Solitaire's early life, there are suggestions that she, too, avoids men because of their unwanted sexual advances in her past. Kissy Suzuki reports to Bond that during her brief career in Hollywood, when she was 17, [...] "They thought that because I am Japanese I am <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> animal and that my body is for everyone." [...] The implication is often that these violent episodes have turned the Bond girls in question against men, though upon encountering Bond they overcome their earlier antipathy and sleep with him not only willingly but eagerly. The cliché reaches its most extreme (perhaps absurd) level in Goldfinger. In this novel Pussy Galore is portrayed as a practising lesbian when she first meets Bond, {{but at the end of}} the novel she sleeps with him. When, in bed, he says to her, [...] "They told me you only liked women," [...] she replies, [...] "I never met a man before." ...|$|E

50|$|A few episodes {{also include}} <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Geoffrey-type figure for Zippo called Vince. He {{seemed to be}} <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> brother to Geoffrey.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{always wanted}} to endow <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> institution, and I am going to begin with this," [...] said Mr. Laurie, sitting down on a stool at Mrs. Jo's feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{speak to}} him much," [...] said Mike cautiously. It is always {{delicate}} work answering a question like this unless one has <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inkling as to {{the views of the}} questioner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you {{can keep}} that for yourself," [...] said she, [...] "and we'll pay your passage back. But we {{would like you to}} wait here for a while. There may be <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> answer." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Must be <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> outlet beyond," [...] he mused. [...] "I'll try it and see," [...] and in {{a moment}} more he was inside of the cavern and {{crawling}} along on hands and knees.|$|E
6000|$|... "My coach waits to-night, gentlemen," [...] said he, with <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> accent {{that did}} not escape us. [...] "It would give me the {{greatest}} pleasure and you will sup with me in Hanover Square." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{they went}} once more, until Dave was almost certain he saw <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> opening ahead of them. He pointed it out; and {{just then the}} tiny light of the pocket lantern began to flicker.|$|E
6000|$|... "B. Henderson Asher," [...] he said severely, [...] "ought {{to be in}} <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> home. Cain killed Abel {{for telling}} him that story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fred {{was saying}} the same thing only a few days ago," [...] {{answered}} Tom. [...] "We certainly ought to have <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> blow-out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hardly, or he'd be out already," [...] {{answered}} Shep. [...] "Let us pull those branches away. They {{might give}} him <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> foothold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it {{you have}} done now?" [...] said the earl. The boy had <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> idea that the offence {{committed}} was with reference to his sister; and his tone was hardly as gracious as was usual with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "He was, up to {{five days}} ago, when they {{took him to the}} {{hospital}} to undergo <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> operation. At the hospital the operation was postponed for a day, and during the night he slipped away from the institution and disappeared." ...|$|E
60|$|Still, {{there was}} something, <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{undefined}} consciousness, {{which seemed to}} rise {{in the way of}} an off-hand proposal to stay at this inn for several days, when I had clearly stated that I wished to stop only for the night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'll {{see what}} can be done," [...] {{answered}} the stranger. [...] "Will {{you come to the}} office and make <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> complaint?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Mr. Brinsmade {{tells me}} that young Brice won rather a {{remarkable}} case last winter, and since then has had some practice. And that he writes for the newspapers.

6000|$|... "Ah, well," [...] Herr Selingman declared, [...] "opportunities will come. You have perhaps {{lost some}} post. Well, there are others.

6000|$|... "Why, I {{was just}} trying----" [...] Grief paused and drained his glass. [...] "Just {{trying to reach}} <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{equitable}} arrangement.
