40|$|For high {{temperature}} interconnection <b>sintered</b> <b>silver</b> can be used, however, it induces new {{demands on the}} thermo-mechanical design. That issue requires knowledge on the thermo-mechanical reliability of <b>silver</b> <b>sintered</b> devices, {{the subject of this}} paper. Material characteristics of the sinter layers are needed for simulation, which are addressed {{in the first part of}} the paper. Based on material properties of pure <b>silver,</b> for <b>sintered</b> <b>silver</b> with different porosities effective material characteristics have been derived by use of a micromechanical cell model. Shear loadings with in-situ deformation analyses have also been made to investigate <b>sintered</b> <b>silver</b> behavior. A complicated dependence on processing, temperature, and deformation rate is seen. Based on different effective constitutive models for the sintered interconnects, stress loadings are studied for a power module, an IGBT on DCB substrate, for passive and active thermal cycling. For the passive cycle complex interactions of the different layers of the stack are observed, which are not seen in a module with soft solder bonding. This result can be attributed to the missing decoupling by the soft soldering layer. Failure risks are evaluated by both conventional FEA and cohesive zone modeling. A quite different stress situation is depicted for active power cycling. The situation is even more complex and it is obvious from the simulations, that active power cycling can induce failure modes different from passive cycling...|$|R

Our recipe incorporates nylon fibers having a diameter of ~ 50 microns and thin wires of bulk silver in the heat exchanger.

In addition, the silver wires reinforce the structural integrity, and reduce the resistance, of the <b>silver</b> <b>sinter.</b> We have constructed a 3 -He melting curve thermometer (MCT) {{with this type of}} heat exchanger and measured the thermal time response of the liquid 3 -He inside the MCT in the temperature range T = 2 - 150 mK.

40|$|New microjoining {{materials}} {{are needed for}} the soldering of electronic components due to environmental concern, reliability concern, and designing restriction. For example, a new low melting point solder is needed due to the thermal stress becoming more harmful {{as a result of}} thinner products. Development of such new microjoining materials is helped by fast methods for the testing of more candidate alloys in shorter time. This thesis describes the development of a real time resistance monitoring method, and the use of it to improve the understanding of microjoining process and reliability with four examples: current stressing of solder joints, solder reflow process, <b>silver</b> <b>sintering</b> process, and power cycling of solder joints, respectively. In the current stressing of solder joints, a high constant DC current is applied to the Sn 3 Ag 0. 5 Cu (SAC 305) solder samples, and the sample resistance is recorded in real time. Complete resistance vs. time curves are obtained from start to failure. Four stages are identified from the resistance curve, and are explained with intermetallic layer growth, crack formation, crack healing and formation, and final open, as observed from cross sectional studies. In the solder reflow process, two SnPb solder pastes with different levels of freshness are studied. Sample resistances are recorded during the reflow process. Simultaneous multiple sample monitoring is achieved. Characteristic resistance vs. time curves are obtained for both solders. Other than the initial resistance difference between the two solders, a special event of transient high resistance is observed for the older solder, and is explained with flux segregation between the solder balls and the lead fingers, as observed from cross sections. In the <b>silver</b> <b>sintering</b> process, two special digital multimeters are integrated to cover a large range of resistance values (10 ⁻⁴- 10 ¹⁰ Ω). The setup can work in different modes, depending on the requirement of fast sampling rate, large resistance range, or massive data for statistics. The resistance vs. time signal of the <b>silver</b> <b>sintering</b> process is obtained, and typically shows three stages: 1. dropping and rising forming a “V” shape in the range of ~ 10 ⁴- 10 ¹⁰ Ω, 2. steady resistance value of ~ 10 ¹⁰ Ω followed by an abrupt resistance drop to < 1 kΩ, and 3. steady resistance drop to < 1 mΩ. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and cross sectioning are used for understanding resistance signals. As a result, the three stages are correlated to: 1. solvent evaporation, 2. capping agent degradation, and 3. <b>silver</b> <b>sintering.</b> In the power cycling of solder joints, a total of two different PCB designs, and four solder {{materials are}} studied, including SAC 305 and three solders that contain Bi. From the first PCB design with Sn 57. 6 Bi 0. 4 Ag solder, two failure modes are observed depending on the peak temperature. When the peak temperature is too high, the resistance signals show insignificant change, and the solder joints becomes grainy. When the peak temperature is moderate, resistance signals show rise until open, and cracks are observed from cross sectioning studies of failed samples. From the second PCB design with a larger resistor size, under the same stressing condition, the Sn 57. 6 Bi 0. 4 Ag solder joints show insignificant resistance change and become grainy in appearance, while all other three solders show resistance rise until open and interfacial cracks in cross sectional studies. In summary, new methods are developed with real time resistance monitoring technology to study solder joints reliability and microjoining processes. More knowledge is learned for the solder joints reliability such as the finding of crack healing events, and for the microjoining processes such as the discovery of flux segregation...|$|E
