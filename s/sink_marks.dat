50|$|Rib {{features}} help in {{strengthening the}} molded part without adding to wall thickness. In some cases, {{they can also}} act as decorative features. Ribs also provide alignment in mating parts or provide stopping surfaces for assemblies. However, projections like ribs can create cavity filling, venting, and ejection problems. These problems become more troublesome for taller ribs. Ribs need to be designed in correct proportion to avoid defects such as short shots and provide the required strength. Thick and deep ribs can cause <b>sink</b> <b>marks</b> and filling problems respectively. Deep ribs {{can also lead to}} ejection problems. If ribs are too long or too wide, supporting ribs may be required. It is better to use a number of smaller ribs instead of one large rib.|$|E

40|$|Optimal {{setting up}} of {{injection}} molding process variables plays {{a very important}} role in controlling the quality of the injection molded products. It is all the most important to control attribute defects like <b>sink</b> <b>marks.</b> <b>Sink</b> <b>marks</b> are basically a “designed in” problem and hence it is to be attended during designs stages. Owing to certain conditions and constraints, sometimes, it is rather ignored during design stages and it is expected to be handled by molders with only instruction to ‘do the best’. Handling of numerous processing variables to control defects is a mammoth task that costs time, effort and money. This paper presents a simple and efficient way to study the influence of injection molding variables on <b>sink</b> <b>marks</b> using Taguchi approach. Using the Taguchi approach, optimal parameter settings and the respective sink depth were arrived. The sink depth based on the validation trials was compared with the predicted sink depth and they are found to be in good agreement.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper a {{computer}} simulation tool, the NASPLAN code, is presented towards the intelligent design of the injection moulding process in complex and multicavity moulds, Furthermore, the NASPLAN code has been coupled with three different numerical optimisation methods in order to design the guidance of melt either by tuning the gates' geometry optimally or by introducing appropriate vacuum at specific areas. This procedure leads to flow balancing and improved part quality by minimising flow-generated defects such as warpage, non-uniform shrinkage, <b>sink</b> <b>marks,</b> etc. Furthermore, the use of vacuum results in faster filling stage with lower injection pressure requirements. Finally, three test cases have been studied to demonstrate the effectiveness and {{the usefulness of the}} proposed methods. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The goal of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the optimum value of design variables in mixed conditions of the thickness, height and draft angle of reinforcing ribs within an objective limit in ABS resin and a high glossy surface. For this purpose, we investigated the actual depths of <b>sink</b> <b>marks</b> on the surface of the specimen that was manufactured with an injection mold specifically for this study. A response surface methodology with the Box-Behnken design was used to analyze the real depths with combinations of the thickness, height and draft angle of the ribs. The result shows that the most influential factor to increase the shrinkage is the thickness of ribs and that the optimum value of the rib thickness is a multiple of 0. 31 of the section thickness. It was found that the rib height and rib draft angle are not factors that can change the sink amount...|$|E

30|$|Injection molds {{were widely}} used for mass {{production}} of thermoplastic parts {{with a high}} production efficiency [1]. The quality of injection production {{is related to the}} mold steel materials [2] and the structure [3, 4]. Particularly, cooling channels in molds greatly affect the productivity, product deformation and die life [5, 6]. Conventional straight-line channels easily cause a heterogeneous heat dissipation and cooling due to the inconsistency between channels and mold cavities. Moreover, the heterogeneous cooling will increase the cooling time [7], even result in some defects such as part warping and <b>sink</b> <b>marks</b> [2, 8]. By contrast, the emerging conformal cooling channels that conform to mold cavities can bring into a steady and homogeneous heat transfer from the cavity surfaces to the coolant, which improves directly the product quality [9]. However, it is difficult to fabricate molds with conformal cooling channels by traditional manufacturing techniques, such as machining, and electrical discharge machining (EDM).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The article {{deals with}} the basic {{technological}} aspects of injection moulding, pointing {{to the importance of}} correct product geometry design. Large differences in the wall thickness of the mould result in uneven cooling, material shrinkage, and the formation of internal stress.

The article describes the application of a specific example of one of the ways of correction of the mould wall thickness used in technological practice of the injection moulding technology. This is a case of employing the method of the so-called relief pins. After the introduction of the proposed modification of the form, the mould quality has improved, thereby increasing the production efficiency in the process of shape optimization of manufacturing the product called Installation Box Series S-BOX 106 made of polyamide PA 66.

It starts by preparing the Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawing for three types of mould designs. These drawings were then exported to Cadmould 3 D-F, as the selected Computer Aided Equipment (CAE) simulation software. This software was used to identify the injection moulding defects and to define the best parameter setting to produce the samples.

The {{results show that the}} mould design with larger runner size (Test 1) can reduce several defects such as <b>sink</b> <b>marks,</b> weld-lines and air traps, as compared with the smaller runner size (Test 2).
