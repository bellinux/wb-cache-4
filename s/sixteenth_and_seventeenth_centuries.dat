5|$|In the <b>sixteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>centuries,</b> {{the status}} of women amongst masons in Britain is likely to be similar to that codified in the minutes of the lodge at St. Mary's Chapel in Edinburgh. A burgess could pay for the Freedom to employ and {{instruct}} masons. The widow of a master mason could accept commissions from his old clients, provided that she employed a journeyman of the lodge to supervise the work.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Inns of Chancery {{was used as}} {{accommodation}} and offices by solicitors, the other branch of the English legal profession. During the <b>sixteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>centuries</b> {{the purpose of the}} Inns changed. After the outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642, the practice of teaching barristers in the Inns ceased, and as a result the Inns of Chancery became a dedicated association for solicitors instead, offering offices and accommodation. The foundation of the Society of Gentlemen Practisers and Law Society of England and Wales in 1739 and 1825 respectively as professional bodies for the solicitors profession relegated the Inns of Chancery to little more than eccentric dining clubs, and they were gradually dissolved and sold. In 1897 a popular book reported that nobody could remember the purpose of the buildings and that an 1850 investigation had failed to uncover their origins. The last Inn to be sold was Clement's Inn, which was sold in 1903, and demolished in 1934.|$|E

25|$|In 1582, Friar Phillipe de Caverell visited Lisbon and {{described}} its customs; he mentions the Portuguese people’s {{love for the}} cittern and other musical instruments.

25|$|In Europe {{the medieval}} concept of Christian care evolved during the <b>sixteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>centuries</b> into a secular one. In England, after the {{dissolution}} of the monasteries in 1540 by King Henry VIII, the church abruptly ceased to be the supporter of hospitals, and only by direct petition from the citizens of London, were the hospitals St Bartholomew's, St Thomas's and St Mary of Bethlehem's (Bedlam) endowed directly by the crown; this was the first instance of secular support being provided for medical institutions.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} atheism re-emerged {{initially}} {{as a reaction}} to the intellectual and religious turmoil of the Age of Enlightenment and the Reformation, as a charge used by those who saw the denial of god and godlessness in the controversial positions being put forward by others. During the <b>sixteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>centuries,</b> the word 'atheist' was used exclusively as an insult; nobody wanted to be regarded as an atheist. Although one overtly atheistic compendium known as the Theophrastus redivivus was published by an anonymous author in the seventeenth century, atheism was an epithet implying a lack of moral restraint.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of domes in the <b>sixteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>centuries</b> relied primarily on empirical techniques and oral traditions {{rather than the}} architectural treatises of the times, which avoided practical details.

Materials were considered homogeneous and rigid, with compression taken into account and elasticity ignored. The weight of materials {{and the size of the}} dome were the key references. Lateral tensions in a dome were counteracted with horizontal rings of iron, stone, or wood incorporated into the structure.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{evidence}} currently {{suggests that}} the point of biogeographical origin for the thrips is in Southeast Asia or on the Indian subcontinent, the original host remains unknown. Chili peppers did not arrive in India until the <b>sixteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>centuries</b> with Portuguese traders, so the host upon which S. dorsalis was first described cannot be the point of origin. Given S. dorsalis’ broad polyphagy and long history of pestilent behavior, it has been speculated that a weed such as castor that was adopted for agriculture {{may have been one}} of several hosts of origin, and that the thrips adapted and began to exploit other hosts as they became available in the changing agricultural landscape.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sense}} of {{commercial}} music enjoyed by the people, British popular music {{can be seen to}} originate in the <b>sixteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>centuries</b> {{with the arrival of the}} broadside ballad, which were sold cheaply and in great numbers until the nineteenth century. Further technological, economic and social changes led to new forms of music in the nineteenth century, including the brass band, which produced a popular and communal form of classical music. Similarly, the music hall sprang up to cater for the entertainment of new urban societies, adapting existing forms of music to produce popular songs and acts. In the 1930s the influence of American Jazz led to the creation of British dance bands, who provided a social and popular music that began to dominate social occasions and the radio airwaves.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the Song dynasty (980−1279), Hainan became part of Guangxi, {{and for the first time}} large numbers of Han Chinese arrived, {{settling}} mostly in the north. Under the Mongol Empire (1206–1368) the island became an independent province then in 1370 was placed under the administration of Guangdong by the ruling Ming dynasty. In the <b>sixteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>centuries,</b> large numbers of Han people from Fujian and Guangdong began migrating to Hainan, pushing the Li into the highlands in the southern half of the island. In the eighteenth century, the Li rebelled against the Qing Empire, which responded by bringing in mercenaries from the Miao regions of Guizhou. Many of the Miao settled on the island and their descendants live in the western highlands to this day.|$|E
25|$|Singing a Psalm {{in unison}} was a {{standard}} practice {{before and after}} the sermon in all Reformed churches in the <b>sixteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>centuries,</b> with Zurich ending their prohibition on church music in 1598. A leader sang each line with the congregation repeating. Organs were forbidden, though trumpets were gradually introduced. Works like the 1562 English Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter were very popular among the Reformed. Literal translations of the Psalms began to be preferred by the Reformed over the looser translations of the Genevan and Sternhold and Hopkins psalters {{in the latter part of}} the sixteenth century. Some of the most influential psalters of the seventeenth century were the Scottish Psalter of 1635 and the Bay Psalm Book of 1640, which was the first book printed in America.|$|E
