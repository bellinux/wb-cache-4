Prince Edward Island that the by-population French-speaking minority of Summerside PEI could exercise their Section 23 Charter right to native-language local education. The analysis of this decision by Ministry staff posits that separate-by-language buses must be operated along with separate-by-language schools, and such has been applied. In the 2014-15 school year, New Brunswick budgeted to spend $64.8-million in order to bus 90,000 students; or in other words, $720 for each student. The Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick's only Acadian MLA in March 2015 threatened to split from the party if discussion were re-opened on school bus re-unification. However, the SCC decision at paragraph 61 states that [...] "The Appeal Division erred in... concluding that buses could be considered educational facilities." [...] Tristin Hopper, a journalist for the National Post observed in 2015 that it [...] "would appear to place schoolbuses outside the realm of the Charter", which deals in Section 23 with “minority language educational facilities.” Still and all, NB Attorney-General and at the time Minister of Education Serge Rousselle mandated his department to eliminate a unified schoolbus <b>service</b> <b>arrangement</b> that had developed organically in Richibucto.|$|E

They were put into service on routes linking the Crimea and Caucasus, and another ten aircraft were ordered. The following year, services were expanded to Tehran in a joint <b>service</b> <b>arrangement</b> with Junkers Luftverkehr. On 1 May 1929, seven Ukrvozduhput K-4s flew in formation from Kharkiv to Rostov, Sochi, Mineralnye Vody and Tbilisi. Service with the airline was short, however, as the K-4 demonstrated a poor safety record. Between 23 May and 24 August, K-4s were involved in fourteen accidents, including two in which passengers were killed. The first of these fatal accidents took place on 25 June, when K-4 (registered СССР-219) crashed after take-off from Sukhumi due to engine failure, killing two passengers. The second took place on 24 August when K-4 registered СССР-217 dove suddenly into the sea shortly after takeoff from Sochi. The wooden wings of the aircraft enabled it to float long enough for rescuers to reach it, however it sank soon afterwards, taking one passenger {{and one of the}} rescuers with it. The rescuer who drowned was celebrated Latvian military commander Jan Fabricius, who had been Commander and the Commissioner of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War. Although the subsequent investigation attributed the crash to pilot error, numerous manufacturing defects were discovered throughout the K-4 fleet, leading to their withdrawal from service shortly thereafter.|$|E

40|$|This study explores refuse {{collection}} as a municipal service using qualitative methods {{to examine how}} government makes decisions about residential {{refuse collection}} services in Portland, Gresham, and Beaverton, Oregon. The study explores the history of refuse collection in these three cities to identify factors that influence bureaucratic behavior and decision making when selecting a municipal service delivery option for refuse collection. Public choice and public policy analysis theory are used to discuss those non-monetary considerations present when government makes decisions about service arrangements. Qualitative data was collected from public officials and private haulers involved in refuse collection in the three cities. This qualitative process was to capture, in context, {{the development of the}} industry. The use of a single criterion in determining choice of private organizational forms may not create the results desired by municipal governments. Choice in the selection of a <b>service</b> <b>arrangement</b> has two important aspects: (1) the array of <b>service</b> <b>arrangement</b> options that can be developed and (2) the contextual environment within which bureaucrats operate and which influences the decision making process.

So, the algorithm tries to change the <b>servicing</b> <b>arrangement</b> of trains to earn more value of satisfaction. For example, for train 7 which is considered as high priority train, the satisfaction rate was 0.27 in previous solution and increased to 0.61 in the new solution by changing to arrival time of locomotive and <b>servicing</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Hence, the suggested algorithm for serving the trains tries to maximize the satisfaction rate of high priority trains considering the other objectives, namely, traveling time, distance and waiting time.|$|R
