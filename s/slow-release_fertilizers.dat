40|$|The use of <b>slow-released</b> <b>{{fertilizer}}</b> {{has become}} a new trend to save fertilizer consumption and to minimize environmental pollution.

However, use in agriculture, especially for plant production, is an under-explored area in the research community. In this study, nano-carbon was incorporated into <b>slow-released</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and the influence on rice yield and nitrogen loss in surface water of paddy soil was conducted by field experiment. The experiment was a randomized block design with five treatments and three replications, the Control (CK), Jingzhengda <b>Slow-released</b> <b>fertilizer</b> (JSCU, N 42 %), Jingzhengda <b>Slow-released</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and nano-Carbon (JSCU+C), Stanley <b>slow-released</b> compound <b>fertilizer</b> (SSRF, N-P 2 O 5 -K 2 O = 20 : 9 : 11), Stanley <b>Slow-Released</b> compound <b>Fertilizer</b> and nano-carbon (SSRF+C), respectively. The results indicated that the total nitrogen concentration in surface water of paddy soil increased rapidly at the 2 nd day after fertilization and decreased gradually after that in all treatments. Compare to JSCU, sampling at different times after fertilization, the total nitrogen concentration in surface water of paddy soil under JSCU+C treatment was declined in the range of 19. 1 - 46. 8 %, the average was 31. 0 % and the time of nitrogen runoff loss due to rainfall was shorten 2. 2 day. For SSCU+C treatment, the average total nitrogen concentration was decreased by 29. 8 % and the time of nitrogen runoff loss was shortening 1. 8 day. The rice grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency were increased significantly after applying <b>slow-released</b> <b>fertilizer</b> added nano-carbon. The rice grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency under JSRU+C and SSRF+C treatments were 11650. 5 kg/hm 2, 21. 4 kg/kg N and 11201. 0 kg/hm 2, 18. 4 kg/kg N, respectively, increased by 11. 3 %, 7. 9 kg/kg N compared with JSRU and 5. 6 % and 4. 4 kg/kg N compared with SSRF.

Oil degradation was monitored by measuring carbon dioxide evolution and by chemical analysis of the oil.

40|$|The recent {{increase}} in fertilizer costs, especially nitrogen fertilizers, {{has resulted in}} technologies that may improve nitrogen use efficiencies in agronomic cropping systems. Many of these technologies are designed as fertilizer additives to increase fertilizer use efficiencies by increasing plant fertilizer uptake and crop yields. The resulting fertilizer formulations include some type of extra additive within the formulation or applied as a coating and are {{often referred to as}} “enhanced efficiency fertilizers ” (EEFs). The Association of American Plant Food Control Officials defines EEFs as products with characteristics that allow increased plant uptake and therefore reduce potential nutrient losses to the environment (e. g., gaseous losses, leaching, or runoff) when compared to an appropriate reference fertilizer that does not contain additives (AAPFCO 2012). When comparing nitrogen EEFs, examples of reference products would be traditional fertilizer such as anhydrous ammonia, granular urea, ammonium sulfate, and urea-ammonium nitrate solutions. The AAPFCO further breaks down EEFs into two distinct subcategories: (1) stabilized fertilizers and (2) controlled or <b>slow-release</b> <b>fertilizers.</b> 1.

Ammonia volatilization was assessed using semi-open static collectors for 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10 days after N fertilization.

50|$|Two or more {{inches of}} compost {{can be used}} alone or in {{conjunction}} with conventional mulch products to keep root zones cool, conserve moisture, and act as a <b>slow-release</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> provided the product is course textured and mature. For a weed barrier, double or triple the depth of compost can be used, placed {{on top of a}} thick layer of newspapers, to replace geomembrane weed barriers. This is obviously only true if the compost is weed free; many are not.|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} effects of {{different}} types of fertilizers and application methods on dry matter production, yield, nitrogen accumulation and use efficiency in rice cultivars, we used two rice cultivars (Nipponbare and Takanari) and five fertilizer methods, i. e. Control (0 N), Conventional method, Deep fertilizer method, Standard fertilizer method and High fertilizer method in 2009. Dry matter production was more markedly increased with nitrogen fertilizer application than in control, and it was higher with deep fertilizer application in Takanari and standard fertilizer application in Nipponbare, respectively. The differences in dry matter production resulted from CGR and mean LAI in rice cultivars. Greater dry matter production was accompanied with the nitrogen accumulation at harvesting. Rice cultivars accumulated the largest amount of nitrogen at deep fertilizer application. Higher fertilizer application increased the number of panicle and total spikelets m– 2. The higher grain yield in Takanari resulted from the larger sink capacity. The grain yield of rice cultivars tended to be higher with deep fertilizer application due to the increase in sink capacity. Both deep fertilizer application and basal application of <b>slow-release</b> <b>fertilizer</b> increased the recovery efficiency and partial factor productivity of applied N, however, using <b>slow-release</b> <b>fertilizer</b> is recommended in terms of labor saving and lower cost. 　水稲の乾物生産，収量，窒素利用効率に及ぼす肥料と施肥法の影響を試験するため，水稲品種日本晴とタカナリを供試し，対照区（無施肥），慣行施肥区（分割追肥），深層追肥区，標準緩効性肥料基肥施肥区，倍量緩効性肥料基肥施肥区の５試験区を用いて栽培を行った．窒素施肥とともに，乾物生産が増大し，最終乾物重はタカナリでは深層追肥区，日本晴では標準緩効性肥料基肥施肥区で最も高くなった．乾物重の相違には個体群成長速度と葉面積指数が主として影響していた．収穫期の乾物重が大きいほど，窒素蓄積が多くなった．窒素蓄積量は両品種ともに深層追肥区で多くなった．施肥量の増加は穂数と㎡当たり穎花数を増加させた．タカナリの収量が高いことには，シンク容量が大きいことが関係した．両品種ともに慣行施肥区に比べ深層追肥区の収量が高くなったが，これにはシンク容量の拡大が関係していた．深層追肥区，標準緩効性肥料基肥施肥区ともに慣行施肥区に比べ窒素回収効率，部分要因生産性ともに向上したが，省力・低コストの観点からは施肥効率の高い緩効性肥料の利用が推奨された...|$|R
40|$|A {{study on}} azalea (Rhododendron L.), 'Kilian' and 'Persil', was {{conducted}} in 2009 – 2010. Plants were grown in pots in the open air, in a peat substrate with a pH of 4. 8. The effect of the following fertilization methods was studied: I – traditional fertilization (single fertilizers were applied in 2 rates); II – a <b>slow-release</b> <b>fertilizer</b> (Hortiform pH); III – combined fertilization (¼ of the rate of nutrients was applied {{in the form of}} single fertilizers and ¾ in the form of Hortiform pH). The <b>slow-release</b> <b>fertilizer</b> Hortiform pH and combined fertilization were applied once in each study year when filling the pots with growing medium. Fertilizers were applied at the basic rate (D 1) and at a twice higher rate (D 2). In the first year of cultivation, the study showed no significant effect of fertilization method on shoot length in both azalea cultivars, whereas in the second year the longest shoots were found after application of the <b>slow-release</b> <b>fertilizer</b> Hortiform pH. In both years of the study, significantly longer shoots were found in the cultivar 'Persil' after application of the lower fertilizer rate (D 1) than after application of the higher fertilizer rate (D 2). On the other hand, the study showed that the fertilizer rate had no effect on shoot length in 'Kilian'. After application of the higher fertilizer rate, a higher content of nitrogen and potassium as well as a lower content of phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium were determined in the leaves of both cultivars. The study found the following percentages to be the optimal nutrient content in azalea leaves: 1. 88 – 2. 20 % N; 1. 0 – 1. 7 % K; and 0. 60 % – 1. 20 % Ca, while the phosphorus content of 0. 09 – 0. 25 % and the magnesium content of 0. 14 – 0. 25 % were shown to be the lower limit for optimal plant nutrition. After the end of the growing season, a low content of all nutrients in the medium was found in both study years, irrespective of the applied fertilizer rate and fertilization method...|$|R
