5000|$|The human ear {{is made up}} {{of three}} areas: the outer, middle and inner ear. Within the inner ear sits the cochlea. The cochlea is a snail-shaped {{formation}} that enables sound transmission via a sensorineural route, rather than through a conductive pathway. [...] The cochlea is a complex structure, consisting of three layers of fluid. The scala vestibuli and <b>scala</b> <b>media</b> are separated by Reissner’s Membrane whereas the <b>scala</b> <b>media</b> and scala tympani are divided by the basilar membrane. [...] The diagram below illustrates the complex layout of the compartments and their divisions: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{cochlear}} duct (or <b>scala</b> <b>media)</b> is an endolymph filled cavity inside the cochlea, located {{in between the}} tympanic duct and the vestibular duct, separated by the basilar membrane and Reissner's membrane (the vestibular membrane) respectively.|$|E
50|$|The basilar {{membrane}} within the cochlea {{of the inner}} ear is a stiff structural element that separates two liquid-filled tubes that run along the coil of the cochlea, the <b>scala</b> <b>media</b> and the scala tympani (see figure).|$|E
50|$|The basal {{end of the}} cochlea, where sounds enter {{from the}} middle ear, encodes the higher end of the audible {{frequency}} range while the apical end of the cochlea encodes {{the lower end of}} the frequency range. This tonotopy plays a crucial role in hearing, as it allows for spectral separation of sounds. A cross section of the cochlea will reveal an anatomical structure with three main chambers (scala vestibuli, <b>scala</b> <b>media,</b> and scala tympani). At the apical end of the cochlea, at an opening known as the helicotrema, the scala vestibuli merges with the scala tympani. The fluid found in these two cochlear chambers is perilymph, while <b>scala</b> <b>media,</b> or the cochlear duct, is filled with endolymph.|$|E
50|$|The upper {{portion of}} the spiral {{ligament}} (which forms the outer wall of the cochlear duct) contains numerous capillary loops and small blood vessels, and is termed the stria vascularis. It produces endolymph for the <b>scala</b> <b>media,</b> {{one of the three}} fluid-filled compartments of the cochlea. The stria is a somewhat stratified epithelium containing primarily three cell types (marginal, intermediate, and basal cells) and intraepithelial capillaries. The marginal cells are involved primarily in K+ transport and line the endolymphatic space of the <b>scala</b> <b>media.</b> The intermediate pigment-containing cells are scattered among capillaries. The basal cells separate stria vascularis from the underlying spiral ligament. The stria vascularis also contains pericyte, melanocyte, and endothelial cells.It is the only epithelial tissue that is not avascular (i.e. completely lacking blood and lymphatic vessels).|$|E
50|$|The {{organ of}} Corti forms a ribbon of sensory {{epithelium}} which runs lengthwise down the cochlea's entire <b>scala</b> <b>media.</b> Its hair cells transform the fluid waves into nerve signals. The journey of countless nerves begins with this first step; from here, further processing {{leads to a}} panoply of auditory reactions and sensations.|$|E
50|$|The cochlea is the tri-chambered {{auditory}} detection {{portion of}} the ear, consisting of the <b>scala</b> <b>media,</b> the scala tympani, and the scala vestibuli. Regarding mammals, placental and marsupial cochleae have similar cochlear responses to auditory stimulation as well as DC resting potentials. This leads to {{the investigation of the}} relationship between these therian mammals and researching their ancestral species to trace the origin of the cochlea.|$|E
50|$|The {{organ of}} Corti, {{in between the}} scala tympani and the <b>scala</b> <b>media,</b> {{develops}} after the formation and growth of the cochlear duct. The inner and outer hair cells then differentiate into their appropriate positions and are followed by {{the organization of the}} supporting cells. The topology of the supporting cells lends itself to the actual mechanical properties that are needed for the highly specialized sound-induced movements within the organ of Corti.|$|E
50|$|The fluids {{in these}} two tubes, the {{endolymph}} and the perilymph are very different chemically, biochemically, and electrically. Therefore, they are kept strictly separated. This separation is the main function of Reissner's membrane (between scala vestibuli and <b>scala</b> <b>media),</b> {{and it is also}} the function of tissue held by the basilar membrane such as the inner and outer sulcus cells (shown in yellow) and the reticular lamina of the organ of Corti (shown in magenta). For the organ of Corti the basilar membrane is permeable to perilymph. Here the border between endolymph and perilymph occurs at the reticular lamina, the endolymph side of the organ of Corti.|$|E
5000|$|The basilar {{membrane}} supports the organ of Corti, which sits within the <b>scala</b> <b>media.</b> [...] The organ of Corti comprises both outer and inner hair cells. There are approximately between 15,000 and 16,000 of these hair cells in one ear. [...] Outer hair cells have stereocilia projecting towards the tectorial membrane, which sits above the organ of Corti. Stereocilia respond to {{movement of the}} tectorial membrane when a sound causes vibration through the cochlea. When this occurs, the stereocilia separate and a channel is formed that allows chemical processes to take place. Eventually the signal reaches the eighth nerve, followed by processing in the brain.|$|E
50|$|The {{inner ear}} {{consists}} of the cochlea and several non-auditory structures. The cochlea has three fluid-filled sections, and supports a fluid wave driven by pressure across the basilar membrane separating two of the sections. Strikingly, one section, called the cochlear duct or <b>scala</b> <b>media,</b> contains endolymph, a fluid similar in composition to the intracellular fluid found inside cells. The organ of Corti is located in this duct on the basilar membrane, and transforms mechanical waves to electric signals in neurons. The other two sections are known as the scala tympani and the scala vestibuli; these are located within the bony labyrinth, which is filled with fluid called perilymph, similar in composition to cerebrospinal fluid. The chemical difference between the fluids endolymph and perilymph fluids {{is important for the}} function of the inner ear due to electrical potential differences between potassium and calcium ions.|$|E
50|$|The {{deflection}} of the hair-cell stereocilia opens mechanically gated ion {{channels that}} allow any small, positively charged ions (primarily potassium and calcium) {{to enter the}} cell. Unlike many other electrically active cells, the hair cell itself does not fire an action potential. Instead, the influx of positive ions from the endolymph in the <b>scala</b> <b>media</b> depolarizes the cell, resulting in a receptor potential. This receptor potential opens voltage gated calcium channels; calcium ions then enter the cell and trigger the release of neurotransmitters at the basal end of the cell. The neurotransmitters diffuse across the narrow space between the hair cell and a nerve terminal, where they then bind to receptors and thus trigger action potentials in the nerve. In this way, the mechanical sound signal is converted into an electrical nerve signal. Repolarization of hair cells is done in a special manner. The perilymph in the scala tympani has a very low concentration of positive ions. The electrochemical gradient makes the positive ions flow through channels to the perilymph.|$|E
50|$|The basilar {{membrane}} on the tympanic duct presses against the hair {{cells of the}} organ as perilymphatic pressure waves pass. The stereocilia atop the IHCs move with this fluid displacement and in response their cation, or positive ion selective, channels are pulled open by cadherin structures called tip links that connect adjacent stereocilia. The organ of Corti, surrounded in potassium rich fluid endolymph, lies on the {{basilar membrane}} {{at the base of}} the <b>scala</b> <b>media.</b> Under the organ of Corti is the scala tympani and above it, the scala vestibuli. Both structures exist in a low potassium fluid called perilymph. Because those stereocilia are in the midst of a high concentration of potassium, once their cation channels are pulled open, potassium ions as well as calcium ions flow into the top of the hair cell. With this influx of positive ions the IHC becomes depolarized, opening voltage-gated calcium channels at the basolateral region of the hair cells and triggering the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. An electrical signal is then sent through the auditory nerve and into the auditory cortex of the brain as a neural message.|$|E
50|$|The {{influx of}} cations, {{particularly}} potassium, {{through the open}} MET channels causes the membrane potential of the hair cell to depolarize. This depolarization opens voltage-gated calcium channels to allow the further influx of calcium. This results {{in an increase in}} the calcium concentration, which triggers the exocytosis of neurotransmitter vesicles at ribbon synapses at the basolateral surface of the hair cell. The release of neurotransmitter at a ribbon synapse, in turn, generates an action potential in the connected auditory-nerve fiber. Hyperpolarization of the hair cell, which occurs when potassium leaves the cell, is also important, as it stops the influx of calcium and therefore stops the fusion of vesicles at the ribbon synapses. Thus, as elsewhere in the body, the transduction is dependent on the concentration and distribution of ions. The perilymph that is found in the scala tympani has a low potassium concentration, whereas the endolymph found in the <b>scala</b> <b>media</b> has a high potassium concentration and an electrical potential of about 80 millivolts compared to the perilymph. Mechanotransduction by stereocilia is highly sensitive and able to detect perturbations as small as fluid fluctuations of 0.3 nanometers, and can convert this mechanical stimulation into an electrical nerve impulse in about 10 microseconds.|$|E

40|$|The low {{regenerative}} {{capacity of}} the hair cells of the mammalian inner ear is a major obstacle for functional recovery following sensorineural hearing loss. A potential treatment is to replace damaged tissue by transplantation of stem cells. To test this approach, undifferentiated and partially differentiated mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were delivered into the <b>scala</b> <b>media</b> of the deafened guinea pig cochlea. Transplanted cells survived in the <b>scala</b> <b>media</b> for a postoperative period of at least nine weeks, evidenced by histochemical and direct fluorescent detection of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Transplanted cells were discovered near the spiral ligament and stria vascularis in the endolymph fluid of the <b>scala</b> <b>media.</b> In some cases, cells were observed close to the damaged organ of Corti structure. There {{was no evidence of}} significant immunological rejection of the implanted ES cells despite the absence of immunosuppression. Our surgical approach allowed efficient delivery of ES cells to the <b>scala</b> <b>media</b> while preserving the delicate structures of the cochlea. This is the first report of the survival of partially differentiated ES cells in the <b>scala</b> <b>media</b> of the mammalian cochlea, and it provides support for the potential of cell-based therapies for sensorineural hearing impairment...|$|E
40|$|During {{injection}} of artificial endolymph into <b>scala</b> <b>media</b> of the guinea pig, fluid pressure was simultaneously measured in endolymph and perilymph with micropipettes. Pressure {{differences in the}} order of 10 Pa could reproducibly be measured upon {{injection of}} 2 - 4 mu l of artificial endolymph with a rate of 50 nl/s. Injection of larger volumes damaged the endolymphatic system. From the results, values were derived for the compliances of the membranes surrounding <b>scala</b> <b>media</b> and the vestibular part of the endolymphatic system. The shape of the pressure-time curve during and between repetitive injections of fluid could well be described with a two-component model for the endolymphatic system, consisting of two compartments with compliant walls, connected through a flow resistance. With this model, a larger compliance was found for the second compartment (vestibular part of endolymphatic system) than for the first compartment, into which fluid was injected (<b>scala</b> <b>media).</b> (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|AbstractAcoustic {{stimulation}} gates mechanically sensitive ion {{channels in}} cochlear sensory hair cells. Even {{in the absence}} of sound, a fraction of these channels remains open, forming a conductance between hair cells and the adjacent fluid space, <b>scala</b> <b>media.</b> Restoring the lost endogenous polarization of <b>scala</b> <b>media</b> in an in vitro preparation of the whole cochlea depolarizes the hair cell soma. Using both digital laser interferometry and time-resolved confocal imaging, we show that this causes a structural refinement within the organ of Corti that is dependent on the somatic electromotility of the outer hair cells (OHCs). Specifically, the inner part of the reticular lamina up to the second row of OHCs is pulled toward the basilar membrane, whereas the outer part (third row of OHCs and the Hensen's cells) unexpectedly moves in the opposite direction. A similar differentiated response pattern is observed for sound-evoked vibrations: restoration of the endogenous polarization decreases vibrations of the inner part of the reticular lamina and results in up to a 10 -fold increase of vibrations of the outer part. We conclude that the endogenous polarization of <b>scala</b> <b>media</b> affects the function of the hearing organ by altering its geometry, mechanical and electrical properties...|$|E
40|$|A {{cochlear}} implant {{may be used}} to electrically stimulate spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in people with severe sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). However, these neurons progressively degenerate after SNHL due to loss of neurotrophins normally supplied by sensory hair cells (HCs). Experimentally, exogenous neurotrophin administration prevents SGN degeneration but can also result in abnormal resprouting of their peripheral fibers. This study aimed to create a target-derived neurotrophin source to increase neuron survival and redirect fiber resprouting following SNHL. Adenoviral (Ad) vectors expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) alone or in combination with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or neurotrophin- 3 (NT 3) were injected into the cochlear scala tympani or <b>scala</b> <b>media</b> of guinea-pigs (GPs) deafened via aminoglycosides for 1 week. After 3 weeks, cochleae were examined for gene expression, neuron survival, and the projection of peripheral fibers in response to gene expression. Injection of vectors into the <b>scala</b> <b>media</b> resulted in more localized gene expression than scala tympani injection with gene expression consistently observed within the partially degenerated organ of Corti. There was also greater neuron survival and evidence of localized fiber responses to neurotrophin-expressing cells within the organ of Corti from <b>scala</b> <b>media</b> injections (P < 0. 05), a first step in promoting organized resprouting of auditory peripheral fibers via gene therapy...|$|E

40|$|The cochlea {{is one of}} a large {{class of}} sense organs, the mechano-receptors. This class in-cludes the non-auditory labyrinth, touch corpus-cles, muscle spindles, sensory endings in joints, tendons, the carotid sinus and elsewhere, and also the lateral-line organ of fishes. These or-gans are all stimulated by {{mechanical}} deforma-tion {{in one way or another}} although they differ widely in respect o absolute sensitivity and in respect to adaptation to a continuing steady stimulus. The cochlea seems to represent the extreme development toward great sensitivity. The ques-tions of adaptation and repetitive discharge are largely academic as the organ is mechanically sensitive only to quick transients or to repetitive vibratory stimulation. The equalization of pres-sure through the helicotrema automatically elimi-nates the problem of stimulation by steady pressure. We shall assume that the main features of the anatomy of the cochlea are familiar, including the oval and the round windows that open to the middle ear, the basilar membrane that separates the spiral cochlear canal into scala vestibuli and scala tympani, and the sensory structures of the organ of C 0 rti that lie within the membranous labyrinth (the <b>scala</b> <b>media)</b> in a long ribbon along the basilur membrane. We shall refer to the basi-lar membrane and all of the structures in the <b>scala</b> <b>media,</b> including Reissner's membrane, as the "cochlear partition. " We accept the rather general opinion that dur-ing life the tectorial membrane (attached by one edge to the limbus of the lamina spiralis) fills a large part of the <b>scala</b> <b>media</b> and that the hairs which project from the free ends of the sensory cells (the external and the internal hair cells) are intimately and probably firmly enmeshed in or attached to its substance (de Vries, 1949).

No statistically significant pressure difference between the <b>scala</b> <b>media</b> and the scala tympani was found, either in ears with EH or the control ears.

40|$|Impairment of the {{cochlear}} blood supply of guinea pigs was induced {{in order to}} {{study the effects of}} hypoxia on {{the cochlear}} action potentials. The oxygenation of the cochlear structures was decreased by perfusing the ears with polycythemic hyperviscous blood. The validity of using this model of cochlear blood flow was based on the propensity of the blood to flow in a laminar way. Because of the streamlined flow pattern, the blood supplied by the two vertebral arteries does not mix within the common trunk of the basilar artery. The retrograde injection of polycythemic hyperviscous blood into one vertebral artery will affect the ear on the injected side only. The high viscosity of the polycythemic blood decreases the rate of flow of blood through the cochlear vessels; the high oxygen content of this blood, however, avoids hypoxia of the cochlea. Therefore, {{in order to make the}} slowdown in the blood flow evident, its oxygen content was reduced to a `precritical level' before it was infused. Injecting normoviscous blood with a `precritical level' of oxygen caused a mild reduction in the <b>scala</b> <b>media</b> pO 2 of 15. 2 % for the whole group of twenty animals. The hyperviscous blood with the same level of oxygenation, however, reduced the pO 2 in the <b>scala</b> <b>media</b> to 53. 3 % of normal. These findings explain the difference in the altered click-evoked action potentials in the two groups of animals...|$|E

40|$|Sensorineural {{hearing loss}} was studied in a rabbit model of {{experimental}} bacterial meningitis using electrophysiological and ultrastructural techniques. Hearing impairment was monitored by auditory brain-stem evoked responses (ABERs) and concomitant structural lesions {{were identified by}} both transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopy. Meningitis was induced by intra-cerebrospinal fluid injection of either Escherichia coli (strain 2073 and type K- 12) or Haemophilus influenzae type b. Auditory loss of approximately equal to 10 dB occurred in all rabbits by about 10 hours post infection and progressed in severity until by 20 h following infection, hearing losses up to and > 60 dB were obtained. At levels of hearing loss < 20 dB ultrastructural damage to the organ of Corti was barely detectable. With greater levels of hearing loss, patchy structural damage to hair cells, synaptic nerve terminals, supporting cells and inner spiral sulcus cells and cells of the stria vascularis was clearly evident. Bacteria were found in scala tympani, the basilar membrane, the organ of Corti, <b>scala</b> <b>media,</b> the spiral ligament and at {{the margin of the}} stria vascularis. Evidence of bleeding was found in some cochleas; erythrocytes were found in scala tympani, <b>scala</b> <b>media,</b> amongst hair cells and beneath the tectorial membrane. The results show that hearing loss is associated with bacterial invasion and damage to the organ of Corti and that the cause of hearing loss is likely to result from multiple lesions within the cochlea. Lesions to sensory cells almost certainly will produce permanent hearing loss. Lesions to supporting cells, nerve terminals and to stria vascularis may well produce only temporary hearing loss...|$|E
