The spider is able to adjust pigment intensity relative to background light levels and color; the range of <b>spectral</b> <b>reflectance</b> is specifically adapted to insect vision.|$|E
25|$|These spiders {{change color}} by {{secreting}} a liquid yellow pigment into the outer cell {{layer of the}} body. On a white base, this pigment is transported into lower layers, so that inner glands, filled with white guanine, become visible. The color similarity between the spider and the flower is well matched with a white flower, in particular the Chaerophyllum temulum, compared to a yellow flower based on the <b>spectral</b> <b>reflectance</b> functions. If the spider dwells longer on a white plant, the yellow pigment is often excreted. It will then take the spider much longer to change to yellow, because {{it will have to}} produce the yellow pigment first.|$|E

The apparatus includes a hand-held spectroradiometer. The readings taken by the radiometer are processed to extract <b>spectral</b> <b>reflectances</b> at sixteen wavelengths between 451 and 949 nm that, taken together, {{have been found to be}} indicative of the presence of Rotylenchulus reniformis.

Principal components analysis (PCA) {{was applied to the}} <b>spectral</b> <b>reflectances</b> from the various races, and a variety of face parts. The first three principal components explain about 99. 8 % of cumulative contribution of variance of <b>spectral</b> <b>reflectances</b> for each race and each face part, and for all races as well. Color differences of spectral reconstruction either for individual races and all races or for individual face parts based on different sets of principal components were estimated. The results indicate that, when using 3 basis functions and under D 50 illumination, the basis functions based only on spectra of Pacific-Asian subjects will provide the best overall color reproduction. However, from a spectral matching point of view, three basis functions based on all spectra will provide the best spectral reproduction with minimum overall mean value of metameric indices. More analyses were applied to <b>spectral</b> <b>reflectances</b> of human facial skin from different sources and their corresponding spectral reconstruction based on different sets of principal components.

40|$|We {{measured}} the diffuse reflectance spectra (0. 25 - 2. 5 μm) of olivine and pyroxene from the ALH- 769 ordinary chondrite (L 6). We examined the systematic {{variations of the}} <b>spectral</b> <b>reflectances</b> of olivine-pyroxene mixtures. We also {{measured the}} <b>spectral</b> <b>reflectances</b> for olivine and pyroxene from the olivine sand in Hanauma Bay, Hawaii for comparison. The absolute calibration {{of the relationship between}} pyroxene chemistry and absorption band position determined by ADAMS (J. Geophys. Res., 79, 4829, 1974) is not accurate. The spectral feature of the pyroxene around 1. 25 μm is sensitive to the existence of the small amount of olivine. This observation does not, however, hold true of the results for the Hawaii clinopyroxene-olivine mixtures. The apparent peak near 0. 6 μm of the olivine is depressed by the existence of the Hawaii clinopyroxene. The absorption band depth around 2 μm is sensitive to the amount of pyroxene. With quantities of pyroxene less than 30 %, the wavelength position of the olivine absorption band near 1. 05 μm shifts drastically. This shift seems to be available for detecting the existence of the small amount of pyroxene in conjunction with the spectral feature around 2 μm. It is hoped to examine the systematic variations of the <b>spectral</b> <b>reflectances</b> of two-component mixtures by using the coexisting pair of the minerals which are separated from meteorites (or rocks) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{multispectral}} imaging system, after necessary calibration, {{can measure}} the <b>spectral</b> <b>reflectances</b> of colour samples accurately {{at a high}} spatial resolution. A limitation is that agreement of its measurements with those of a reference spectrophotometer {{is affected by the}} reflective characteristics of sample materials. The state-of-the-art methods aim to improve interinstrument agreement using the spectral values of neighbouring bands. However, it is observed that non-neighbouring bands are more effective in modelling interinstrument agreement. Inspired by this observation, the present paper proposes a method for eliminating material dependency by least-squares regression among non-neighbouring spectral bands. The fundamental issue of band selection is solved using a binary differential evolution algorithm. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method is effective in reflectance correction in terms of both spectral and colorimetric accuracy. The method is of practical application to multispectral imaging systems when measuring the <b>spectral</b> <b>reflectances</b> of colour samples with different materials.

40|$|Today’s {{spectral}} reflection prediction models {{are able to}} predict the reflection spectra of printed color images with an accuracy {{as high as the}} reproduction variability allows.

Image tiles of a color as uniform as possible are selected within the printed images. The ink spreading behavior is fitted by relying on the <b>spectral</b> <b>reflectances</b> of the selected image tiles. A relevance metric specifies the impact of each ink spreading curve on the selected image tiles. These relevance metrics are used to constrain the corresponding ink spreading curves.

40|$|Towards {{the goal}} of {{spectral}} print reproduction a few obstacles can be found comparing to reproduction of colorimetric match. Human visual system is able to sense wide spectrum of colors and placing that range on substrate, weather paper or any other, requires skills. Traditional printing reproduction is built on metamerism phenomena and now the new challenge to overcome that constraint is set. To create the communication with print mechanism is very important {{and for that reason}} spectral printer modeling represents the crucial step. With this process characterization of the printer is done. This depends on the data given and optimal way of its use needs to be established. With forward printer model the relation between the colorant combination and the resulting <b>spectral</b> <b>reflectances</b> printed on substrate is defined. The inverse process enables printer control to define the colorant separation from spectral refelectances to precise values. Very important step in the whole process is not only measuring the printed material but overcoming time and resources waste with estimating <b>spectral</b> <b>reflectances</b> and combining them with already measured ones. Several models were tested by now and our contribution is consisted of employing Kubelka-Munk theory for estimation step before testing it with cellular model that makes printed cell smaller than unity and therefore more precise. Among the rest possible theories for estimation Kubelka-Munk theory was chosen due to its consideration of light scattering. This was mainly because the study samples used for spectral reproduction were garnament products. Before the target <b>spectral</b> <b>reflectances</b> values can be printed the feasibility of the process should be considered.

Subsequent use of these indices to estimate vegetation amounts would result in substantial uncertainties. To reduce the uncertainties due to sun~view angle variations, spectral albedos, which are integrated reflectance values over a hemisphere of the surface within the specific spectral waveband, were de-rived from multidirectional measurements and bidirec-tional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models and were subsequently used in vegetation i dex computa-tions.
