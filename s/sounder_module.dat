50|$|The Yamaha MU-series {{is a line}} of <b>sound</b> <b>modules</b> {{built by}} Yamaha. All <b>sound</b> <b>modules</b> except MU5 support Yamaha XG. The <b>sound</b> <b>modules</b> were {{commonly}} used when computers had slower processors. The computer could send MIDI commands to the <b>sound</b> <b>module,</b> acting as an external sound generation device. Later MU <b>sound</b> <b>modules</b> feature A/D inputs that allow direct input from microphones and guitars.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sound</b> <b>modules</b> may use {{any number}} of {{technologies}} to produce their <b>sounds.</b> A <b>sound</b> <b>module</b> may be an analog or digital synthesizer, a sampler, or a rompler. Electronic drum <b>module</b> are <b>sound</b> <b>modules</b> which specialize in percussion <b>sounds.</b> Drum <b>modules</b> may be triggered by external trigger pads or pickups {{as well as through}} MIDI. Drum modules are distinguished from drum machines through their lack of dedicated on-board triggers and lack of an integrated sequencer. <b>Sound</b> <b>modules</b> are often rack-mountable, but might also have a table-top form factor, particularly when the intended user is a DJ or record producer. The height of a <b>sound</b> <b>module</b> is often described in rack units ("U") or unit. Small <b>sound</b> <b>modules</b> are mostly 1U in height, the larger models a multiplication e.g. 2U or 3U. Despite the name, [...] "sound module", most <b>sound</b> <b>modules</b> do not produce any audible sound until their output is plugged into a keyboard amplifier and loudspeaker or a PA system.|$|R
50|$|The {{sound source}} {{provides}} the sound for the malletkat. One sound source commonly used is a <b>Sound</b> <b>Module.</b> The <b>Sound</b> <b>Module</b> is a MIDI device which the malletkat gets directed to via a MIDI cable. One {{can also use}} a computer instead of a <b>sound</b> <b>module.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The system {{included}} a <b>sound</b> <b>module</b> and four audio receivers. The frequency of <b>sound</b> <b>module</b> was 500 Hz, and the duration was 1 second. The four audio receivers took different time {{to pick up}} the <b>sound</b> from <b>sound</b> <b>module.</b> Subtractors converted the time lags between every two receivers into phase difference. The hyperbolas were established by calculating the digital signal which was transformed from phase difference...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>sound</b> <b>module</b> {{may also}} be {{referred}} to as [...] "tone generator", [...] "synth module", [...] "MIDI sound generator" [...] or [...] "rack-mount synthesizer". With electronic drums, the <b>sound</b> <b>module</b> is sometimes colloquially called the [...] "brain".|$|R
5000|$|Troubleshooting - if a <b>sound</b> <b>module</b> {{develops}} problems, {{just this}} one unit can be removed for repair or replacement, leaving the rest of a keyboard player's rig the same (e.g., other rack-mounted <b>sound</b> <b>modules,</b> power amps, etc.).|$|R
5000|$|Because most {{electronic}} {{instruments are}} designed in a modularized way, manufacturers often release a <b>sound</b> <b>module</b> version of their fully integrated instruments. For example, the 1980s-era DX-7 synthesizer/keyboard was also {{sold as a}} standalone [...] "sound module", the TX-7. A <b>sound</b> <b>module</b> may have all the other features of the controller-equipped version, but it often has a smaller display or limited programming controls. In this case, instrument and other sounds can be loaded through MIDI or external media. In some cases, <b>sound</b> <b>modules</b> have expanded capacity for sounds {{in comparison to the}} controller-equipped version. In the 2010s, hardware <b>sound</b> <b>modules</b> have largely been replaced with software equivalents ("software synths"), due to the increased speed and processing power of computers and their decrease in price. Nevertheless, some DJs, Electronic dance music (EDM) musicians and record producers continue to use vintage 1980s <b>sound</b> <b>modules</b> for their unique, retro sound.|$|R
50|$|The Roland SC-55 (Sound Canvas) is a GS MIDI <b>sound</b> <b>module</b> {{released}} in 1991 by Roland. The SC-55 {{was the first}} <b>sound</b> <b>module</b> to incorporate the new General MIDI standard. It {{was the first in}} the Roland Sound Canvas series.|$|R
50|$|A <b>sound</b> <b>module</b> is an {{electronic}} musical instrument without a human-playable interface {{such as a}} piano-style musical keyboard. <b>Sound</b> <b>modules</b> have to be operated using an externally connected device, which is often a MIDI controller, of which {{the most common type}} is the musical keyboard (although wind controllers, guitar controllers and electronic drum pads are also used). Controllers are devices that provide the human-playable interface and {{which may or may not}} produce sounds of its own. Another common way of controlling a <b>sound</b> <b>module</b> is through a sequencer, which is computer hardware or software designed to record and play back control information for sound-generating hardware (e.g., a DJ may program a bassline and use the <b>sound</b> <b>module</b> to produce the sound). Connections between <b>sound</b> <b>modules,</b> controllers, and sequencers are generally made with MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface), which is a standardized protocol designed for this purpose, which includes special ports (jacks) and cables.|$|R
25|$|There are percussion-specific <b>sound</b> <b>modules</b> {{that can}} be {{triggered}} by pickups, trigger pads, or through MIDI. These are called drum modules; the Alesis D4 and Roland TD-8 are popular examples. Unless such a <b>sound</b> <b>module</b> also features a sequencer, it is, strictly speaking, not a drum machine.|$|R

5000|$|Audio {{interfaces}} {{are often}} erroneously called <b>sound</b> <b>modules.</b> The audio interface connects {{a computer to}} other devices; and software in the computer actually generates sound using samples or synthesis.

50|$|Using {{a feature}} called multi-sampling, the Mirage was also capable of {{assigning}} multiple samples to different keys across its keyboard. Using this technique, the Mirage essentially {{turned into a}} polyphonic mult-timbral MIDI <b>sound</b> <b>module</b> complete with a velocity-sensitive keyboard {{that could be used}} to drive other MIDI <b>sound</b> <b>modules</b> as well its own sound engine.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} dealing with design and putting into {{operation}} of <b>sound</b> <b>module</b> for evaluation kit Atmel ATSTK 1000. At the beginning, there is an introduction with properties, hardware and software equipment of the evaluation kit which is used for development of embedded devices based on AT 32 AP 7000. The microcontroller AP 7000 is a complete system on chip with an AVR 32 microprocessor core, containing additional supporting circuits, controllers and interfaces which the core itself does not have included. However, there is no {{digital to analog converter}} for audio signal processing. This has led to design an additional module performing this task. A part of thesis describes Intel AC‘ 97 standard including AC-link interface, which is used for full-duplex data transmission between realized <b>sound</b> <b>module</b> and the evaluation kit STK 1000. The <b>sound</b> <b>module</b> is designed as a plug-in card.
