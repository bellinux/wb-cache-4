5|$|Since LAGs can be obliterated by bone remodeling, this {{represents}} an underestimate {{of the true}} number of LAGs that had actually developed; McDonald and colleagues estimated three or four missing LAGs by examining the spacing between the visible LAGs. This indicates that the animal was eight to nine years old when it died. The spacing between the LAGs decreases significantly towards the outer surface, indicating that growth was slowing, {{but the lack of}} the external fundamental system (a series of tightly-spaced LAGs) indicates that growth had not yet ceased. This is consistent with the unfused <b>sutures</b> between the centra and neural spines in the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, and the unfused <b>sutures</b> between the sacral centra and their corresponding ribs. Overall, the growth rate of Eolambia appears to have been comparable to that of Hypacrosaurus and Maiasaura, which reached maturity after seven or eight years.|$|E

5|$|In {{some parts}} of the world (mainly Africa and South America), large ants, {{especially}} army ants, are used as surgical <b>sutures.</b> The wound is pressed together and ants are applied along it. The ant seizes the edges of the wound in its mandibles and locks in place. The body is then cut off and the head and mandibles remain in place to close the wound. The large heads of the dinergates (soldiers) of the leafcutting ant Atta cephalotes are also used by native surgeons in closing wounds.|$|E

5|$|Unlike semiaquatic temnospondyls, {{terrestrial}} temnospondyls have skulls {{that are}} adapted for biting land-living prey. The <b>sutures</b> between {{the bones of}} the skull in the dissorophoid Phonerpeton are able to withstand a high degree of compression. Compressive forces would have been experienced when biting down on prey. Earlier aquatic tetrapods and tetrapod ancestors differ from temnospondyls like Phonerpeton in that their skulls were also built to withstand tension. This tension would have been experienced during suction feeding underwater. Temnospondyls like Phonerpeton were among the first tetrapods that were almost exclusively terrestrial and fed by biting.|$|E
5|$|A 2017 {{histological}} {{study of}} growth lines {{found that the}} Portuguese Baryonyx specimen had died between the age of 23 and 25 years old, and was close to its maximum size and skeletal maturity. This contradicted a younger age indicated by the neurocentral <b>sutures</b> not being fused, {{and the presence of}} both mature and sub-adult traits may be due to paedomorphosis (where juvenile traits are retained into adulthood). Paedomorphic traits may be related to swimming locomotion, as they have been suggested in other extinct animals thought to have been aquatic (such as plesiosaurs and temnospondyls). The study also found that the animal had reached sexual maturity at the age of 13 to 15 years, due to a decrease in growth rate at this point.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to single layer <b>suturing,</b> two layer <b>suturing</b> generally involves <b>suturing</b> at {{a deeper level}} of a tissue followed by another layer of <b>suturing</b> at a more superficial level.

This feature helps differentiate parasaurolophins from lambeosaurins. Generally, the crests of juveniles of lambeosaurines like Corythosaurus, Lambeosaurus, Hypacrosaurus stebingeri, parasaurolophines like Parasaurolophus, and primitive lambeosaurines like Kazaklambia are quite alike, although other features can be used to distinguish them.|$|E

5|$|Matthew and Brown also {{described}} a fifth skeleton (AMNH 5664), which Charles H. Sternberg had collected in 1917 {{and sold to}} their museum.

Matthew and Brown noted that these features were characteristic of juvenile tyrannosaurids, but still described it as the holotype of a new species, G. sternbergi. Today's paleontologists regard this specimen as a juvenile G. libratus. Dozens of other specimens have been excavated from the Dinosaur Park Formation and are housed in museums across the United States and Canada.

40|$|The {{effect of}} core <b>suture</b> {{geometry}} on the mechanical {{interaction with the}} epitenon <b>suture</b> in terms of gap prevention, failure strength and mode of failure was investigated in a flexor tendon repair model.

Kessler repairs failed mainly by <b>suture</b> rupture, with and without epitenon <b>suture,</b> but cruciate repairs failed mainly by <b>suture</b> pull-out.

50|$|In {{forensic}} anthropology, the sagittal <b>suture</b> is {{one method}} used to date human remains.

50|$|The {{sagittal}} <b>suture</b> is a dense, fibrous {{connective tissue}} joint between the two parietal bones of the skull. The term {{is derived from the}} Latin word sagitta, meaning arrow.

5|$|People with TBI are {{provided}} with supplemental oxygen and may need mechanical ventilation. Employment of certain measures such as Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and ventilation at higher-than-normal pressures may be helpful in maintaining adequate oxygenation. However, such measures can also increase leakage of air through a tear, and can stress the <b>sutures</b> in a tear that has been surgically repaired; therefore the lowest possible airway pressures that still maintain oxygenation are typically used. Mechanical ventilation can also cause pulmonary barotrauma when high pressure is required to ventilate the lungs. Techniques such as pulmonary toilet (removal of secretions), fluid management, and treatment of pneumonia are employed to improve pulmonary compliance (the elasticity of the lungs).|$|E
5|$|Sheepskin is {{likewise}} used for making clothes, footwear, rugs, and other products.

Sheep intestine can be formed into sausage casings, and lamb intestine has been formed into surgical <b>sutures,</b> as well as strings for musical instruments and tennis rackets. Sheep droppings, which are high in cellulose, have even been sterilized and mixed with traditional pulp materials to make paper. Of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is lanolin: the waterproof, fatty substance found naturally in sheep's wool and used as a base for innumerable cosmetics and other products.|$|E
5|$|The head is {{enclosed}} in a hard, heavily sclerotized, unsegmented, exoskeletal head capsule, or epicranium, which contains {{most of the}} sensing organs, including the antennae, ocellus or eyes, and the mouthparts.

Here, the vertex, or the apex (dorsal region), is situated between the compound eyes for insects with a hypognathous and opisthognathous head. In prognathous insects, the vertex is not found between the compound eyes, but rather, where the ocelli are normally. This is because the primary axis of the head is rotated 90° to become parallel to the primary axis of the body. In some species, this region is modified and assumes a different name.|$|E

Although monofilament is considered to slide through the tendon tissue more smoothly, it was considered to have greater friction between the strands than the PTFE coated braided <b>suture.</b> This may have reduced tension throughout the <b>suture</b> configuration and knot tightness.|$|R
40|$|Background: This prospective, {{randomized}} {{study was}} conducted to compare clinical outcomes of the modified Broström proce-dure using <b>suture</b> anchor or transosseous <b>suture</b> technique for chronic ankle instability. Methods: Forty patients were followed for more than 2 years after modified Broström procedure. Twenty procedures using a <b>suture</b> anchor and 20 procedures using a transosseous <b>suture</b> were performed by one surgeon. The clinical evaluation consisted of the Karlsson scale and the Sefton grading system. Talar tilt and anterior talar transla-tion were measured on anterior and varus stress radiographs. Results: The Karlsson scale had improved significantly to 90. 8 points in the <b>suture</b> anchor group, and to 89. 2 points in the transosseous <b>suture</b> group. According to Sefton grading system, 18 patients (90 %) in <b>suture</b> anchor group and 17 patients (85 %) in transosseous <b>suture</b> group achieved satisfactory results.

5|$|Cladistic {{analyses}} of tyrannosaurid phylogeny often find Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa, with Daspletosaurus more basal than either. A {{close relationship between}} Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus is supported by numerous skull features, including the pattern of <b>sutures</b> between certain bones, {{the presence of a}} crescent-shaped crest on the postorbital bone behind each eye, and a very deep maxilla with a noticeable downward curve on the lower edge, among others. An alternative hypothesis was presented in a 2003 study by Phil Currie and colleagues, which found weak support for Daspletosaurus as a basal member of a clade also including Tarbosaurus and Alioramus, both from Asia, based on the absence of a bony prong connecting the nasal and lacrimal bones. Alioramus was found to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus in this study, based on a similar pattern of stress distribution in the skull.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a unique Knotless <b>suture</b> anchor for soft tissue repair to bone is described. This device allows for soft tissue repair to bone using a <b>suture</b> anchor {{without the need for}} knot tying. This provides a particular advantage for arthroscopic repairs, where knot tying can be difficult. The Knotless <b>suture</b> anchor has a short loop of <b>suture</b> secured to {{the tail end of the}} anchor. A channel located at the tip of the anchor functions to capture the loop of <b>suture</b> after it has been passed through the soft tissue. The soft tissue is ten-sioned as the anchor is inserted into bone to the ap-propriate depth. Biomechanical testing demonstrated increased <b>suture</b> strength in the Knotless <b>suture</b> an-chor compared with standard <b>suture</b> anchors. This is because of the doubled-suture configuration that is created with the Knotless <b>suture</b> anchor loop. To the author’s knowledge, this paper describes the first knot-less <b>suture</b> anchor. A secure, low-profile repair can be created without knot tying. In recent years, <b>suture</b> anchors have become popular for both open and arthroscopic repairs of avulsed ligaments or tendons, most commonly for Bankart and rotator cuff re-pairs. 12, 21 Many surgeons have been reluctant to perform arthroscopic <b>suture</b> anchor repairs, however. A good qual-ity arthroscopic <b>suture</b> anchor repair is technically diffi-cult to achieve. Satisfactory knot tying requires signifi-cant practice with special knot-tying devices and unfamiliar knot designs. This process can be difficult to master and time-consuming to perform. Arthroscopically tied knots are bulky and may be inferior to openly tied knots, even in the best of hands. 13 For these reasons, an arthroscopic <b>suture</b> anchor repair using standard <b>suture</b> anchors may not, in fact, be consistently as high quality as an open <b>suture</b> anchor repair (S. C Weber, unpublished data, 1995 and 1998). This report describes the {{development of}} a Knotles...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{presented}} Z-suture is a simple, {{rapid and}} safe knotless technique that facilitates transscleral <b>suture</b> fixation of various intraocular implants in the ciliary sulcus like <b>sutured</b> intraocular lenses, artificial iris prostheses, and iris diaphragms. As the knotless approach reliably avoids <b>suture</b> erosion, external fixation {{can be performed}} without any protecting scleral flaps or lamellar grooves. The needle is simply passed through the sulcus, and the emerging polypropylene <b>suture</b> is secured in the sclera using a zigzag shaped intrascleral <b>suture</b> (Z-suture). Each pass starts directly adjacent to the exiting site. Five passes are sufficient to reliably fix the <b>suture</b> resisting even maximum tractive forces. Once this procedure is done, the <b>suture</b> can be cut without any knot.
