The impact of extreme high waters resulting from the combination of tidal oscillations and changes <b>in</b> mean <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> and <b>in</b> <b>storm</b> surges during the 21 st century has been explored in the Bizkaian coast (northern Spain). Mean <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> variations due to temperature changes were estimated from an ensemble mean of global atmosphere-ocean general circulation models in the Bay of Biscay under A 1 B and A 2 climate change scenarios. Changes in the frequency and intensity of storm surges {{were obtained from the}} output of a barotropic regional ocean model forced by greenhouse gas concentrations during 2000 − 2100. The storm surge model was calibrated using available tide gauge observations. Based on the above estimations, return <b>levels</b> of total <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> extremes are expected to increase by up to 40 cm with respect to present-day values. The likely impacts of resulting floods on coastal and estuarine habitats of the Bizkaian coast were assessed applying the return levels to a high precision light detection and ranging (LiDAR) based Digital Terrain Model.

40|$|Abstract. TheGippsland Lakes, {{listed under}} the Ramsar Convention in 1982, have {{undergone}} chronic salinisation since the cutting in 1889 of an artificial {{entrance to the}} ocean to improve navigational access, exacerbated in the mid–late 20 th century by increasing regulation and extraction of water from inflowing rivers. Both developments have had substantial ecological impacts: a marked decline {{in the area of}} reed (Phragmites australis) beds; the loss of salt-intolerant submerged taxa such asVallisneria australis, causing a shift to a phytoplankton-dominated system in LakeWellington; and, nearer the entrance, an expansion in the area of seagrasses. Mangroves (Avicennia marina) first appeared in the late 1980 s or early 1990 s. Since 1986 recurring blooms of Nodularia spumigena have led to loss of recreational amenity and to the periodic closure of recreational and commercial fisheries. Changes to hydrological and salinity regimes have almost certainly shifted the contemporary fish community away from the pre-entrance state. Rises <b>in</b> eustatic <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> and increases <b>in</b> <b>storm</b> surgeswill exacerbate the issue of chronic salinisation. Whether or notmanagers choose to intervene to prevent, or at least minimise, ongoing environmental change will inevitably prove controversial, and in some cases no socially or technologically feasible solutions may exist...|$|R
40|$|Flood hazards are a {{pressing}} challenge in several Irish and European cities and their impacts {{seem likely to}} intensify as climate change brings <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> rise, changes <b>in</b> <b>storm</b> patterns and increases in rainfall. Drawing on the example of Cork City and the November 2009 flood in particular, this paper evaluates contemporary policy and decision-making responses to flood hazards {{to determine whether they}} are sufficient to address current and future flood risks and vulnerabilities. It is clear that current policy and practice remains heavily influenced by a risk management paradigm that emphasises physical exposure and largely ignores socio-economic vulnerability. Floods and the losses they induce are seen as identical while engineering and technological fixes are viewed as the optimal means of reducing future flood losses. This framing of flood hazards is shaped by several influences including the historic evolution of flood policy and current institutional structures. The November 2009 flood highlights the limits of current policy and practice. Recent changes in national and European policy may also prove to be ineffective in facilitating effective adaptation and further changes in policy and practice are likely to be required...|$|R

40|$|Coastal {{evolution}} is {{an increasingly important}} area of study, especially with the projected rise <b>in</b> <b>sea</b> <b>level,</b> increase <b>in</b> <b>storm</b> intensity, and population increases along the nation's coasts. In order to predict how the coastal environment will respond to these changes in the future, we need to first understand the evolution of coastal systems in the past. Here I address the late Holocene evolution of Currituck Sound, North Carolina, by examining time periods with different barrier island and inlet configurations interpreted from core data.   Chirp seismic data and 13 vibracores {{have been used to}} interpret the Holocene development of this region. Four depositional units have been defined, based on lithofacies, biofacies, geophysical, and geochronologic data. The lowermost depositional unit (Unit I) is represented by quartz sand, barren of foraminifera, and is Pleistocene in age based on an OSL age estimate of 33. 7 ka. Unit II consists of slightly muddy sand that fines upward to slightly sandy mud; it is barren of foraminifera, contains rooted horizons in several cores, and is interpreted as a fresh water swamp forest deposit (radiocarbon dating provide age estimates of ca. 4000 to 2800 cal y BP). Unit III is characterized by slightly sandy mud to mud containing a calcareous foraminiferal assemblage and oyster bioherms; these characteristics indicate a back-barrier estuarine environment with high salinity (ca. 25 to 35) due to open inlets in the barrier islands to the east. Radiocarbon age estimates for Unit IV range from ca. 1700 to 500 cal y BP.   The topmost unit (Unit IV) is composed of sediment with variable composition, ranging from clean quartz sand to mud, and contains foraminiferal assemblages that are generally mixed calcareous/agglutinated at the base overlain by entirely agglutinated assemblages. This unit represents the modern (post- ca. 1827), mid- to low salinity (less than 10), back-barrier lagoon with no inlets open in the barrier island.   Sediment and microfossil-based paleoenvironmental and geomorphic reconstructions, including variable numbers of inlets, have been used as input into the Delft 3 D hydrodynamic model to understand inlet related changes to tides and currents within the Sound. This modeling indicates that impacts of inlets are very localized and only inlets in the direct vicinity of Currituck Sound (i. e., between historic Caffey's Inlet and Kill Devil Hills) {{have a significant impact on}} the water <b>levels</b> and currents <b>in</b> the study area.   M.

40|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>level</b> rise, changes <b>in</b> <b>storms</b> {{and wave}} climate as a {{consequence}} of global climate change are expected to increase the size and magnitude of flooded and eroding coastal areas, thus having profound impacts on coastal communities and ecosystems. River deltas, beaches, estuaries and lagoons are considered particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, which should be studied at the regional/local scale. This paper presents a regional vulnerability assessment (RVA) methodology developed to analyse site-specific spatial information on coastal vulnerability to the envisaged effects of global climate change, and assist coastal communities in operational coastal management and conservation. The main aim of the RVA is to identify key vulnerable receptors (i. e. natural and human ecosystems) in the considered region and localize vulnerable hot spot areas, which could be considered as homogeneous geographic sites for the definition of adaptation strategies. The application of the RVA methodology is based on a heterogeneous subset of bio-geophysical and socio-economic vulnerability indicators (e. g. coastal topography, geomorphology, presence and distribution of vegetation cover, location of artificial protection), which are a measure of the potential harm from a range of climate-related impacts (e. g. <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> rise inundation, storm surge flooding, coastal erosion). Based on a system of numerical weights and scores, the RVA provides relative vulnerability maps that allow to prioritize more vulnerable areas and targets of different climate-related impacts in the examined region and to support the identification of suitable areas for human settlements, infrastructures and economic activities, providing a basis for coastal zoning and land use planning. The implementation, performance and results of the methodology for the coastal area of the North Adriatic Sea (Italy) are fully described in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Coastal erosion is {{a global}} problem, {{affecting}} sandy and rocky shores worldwide, and can be triggered by several causes. Local processes can generate erosion hot spots, whereas at the global scale, the main forcing are <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> rise, changes <b>in</b> <b>storm</b> climate and human interference. Beaches along the Mediterranean sea are strongly affected by coastal erosion. Recently, the Protocol on Integrated Coastal Zone Management in the Mediterranean (PAP/RAC 2007) recommended the prevention of the erosion processes by restoring the natural adaptive capacity of the coast and by improving the knowledge on the state, development and impact of coastal erosion. In order {{to achieve the objective}} of the PAP/RAC protocol, we characterized 24 sandy beaches along ~ 270 km of the western coastline of the Sardinia island (western Mediterranean). Grain size and mineralogy of the foreshore sediments were analyzed and the intertidal elevation/bathymetric profile was measured using Differential Global Positioning System. Aerial photos were used to identify the shoreline configuration, the number of bars and morphodynamic features. A digital elevation model (DEM) of the adjacent shelf was produced and acoustic backscatter, grab and box-corer sediment samples were collected in order to characterize the seafloor and to identify the substrate lithology, particularly the distribution of sandy sediments. The investigated coastline is characterized by linear, multibarred beaches and wide transgressive dune fields formed by terrigenous sand and coarse sand. These linear beaches are alternated with embayed beaches which locally show a mixed terrigenous/bioclastic carbonate composition. Large sandy bodies were found in the inner shelf, often forming dune fields uncovered by mud drape. A database was created to facilitate the characterization of the beach systems along the studied coastline and adjacent inner shelf. It is anticipated that the database will be used by policy makers in support of the implementation of coastal erosion management strategies...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{impacts on}} coastal and estuarine systems {{take many forms}} and are {{dependent}} on the local conditions, including those set by humans. We use a biocomplexity framework to provide a perspective {{of the consequences of}} climate change for coastal wetland ecogeomorphology. We concentrate on three dimensions of climate change affects on ecogeomorphology: <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> rise, changes <b>in</b> <b>storm</b> frequency and intensity, and changes in freshwater, sediment, and nutrient inputs. While <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> rise, storms, sedimentation, and changing freshwater input can directly impact coastal and estuarine wetlands, biological processes can modify these physical impacts. Geomorphological changes to coastal and estuarine ecosystems can induce complex outcomes for the biota that are not themselves intuitively obvious because they are mediated by networks of biological interactions. Human impacts on wetlands occur at all scales. At the global scale, humans are altering climate at rapid rates compared to the historical and recent geological record. Climate change can disrupt ecological systems if it occurs at characteristic time scales shorter than ecological system response and causes alterations in ecological function that foster changes in structure or alter functional interactions. Many coastal wetlands can adjust to predicted climate change, but human impacts, in combination with climate change, will significantly affect coastal wetland ecosystems. Management for climate change must strike a balance between that which allows pulsing of materials and energy to the ecosystems and promotes ecosystem goods and services, while protecting human structures and activities. Science-based management depends on a multi-scale understanding of these biocomplex wetland systems. Causation is often associated with multiple factors, considerable variability, feedbacks, and interferences. The impacts of climate change can be detected through monitoring and assessment of historical or geological records. Attribution can be inferred through these in conjunction with experimentation and modeling. A significant challenge to allow wise management of coastal wetlands is to develop observing systems that act at appropriate scales to detect global climate change and its effects {{in the context of the}} various local and smaller scale effects...|$|R
