40|$|AbstractObjectivesStroke puts a major {{financial}} burden on our healthcare system. However, carotid duplex scanning performed as {{a screening test}} for occult carotid artery stenosis (CAS) currently is not reimbursed by Medicare. The goals {{of this study were}} to develop a cost-effective <b>stroke</b> <b>screening</b> program, to determine the prevalence of potential causes of stroke in this population, and to define a population at high risk in which screening would be most effective. MethodsIn a community-based <b>stroke</b> <b>screening</b> program, patients were eligible if they were older than 60 years and had a history of either hypertension, heart disease, or cigarette smoking, or a family history of <b>stroke.</b> <b>Screening</b> included blood pressure determination, an electrocardiographic rhythm strip, and a previously validated modified carotid duplex ultrasound examination to detect CAS 50 % or greater. The relationships between standard demographic risk factors and screening outcomes were analyzed. ResultsScreening was performed in 610 patients. Unilateral or bilateral CAS was detected in 66 patients (10. 8 %). The finding of occult CAS was more prevalent than that of new hypertension (2. 6 %) or new atrial fibrillation (0. 5 %). Patients with known hypertension {{were significantly more likely to}} have CAS than were those without hypertension (12. 7 % vs 7. 8 %; P =. 05). Patients with heart disease were significantly more likely to have CAS than were those without heart disease (18. 2 % vs 8 %; P <. 0001). Patients with both risk factors were significantly more likely to have occult carotid artery disease than were patients without either risk factor (22. 1 % vs 8. 5 %; P <. 0001). Multivariate analysis with logistic regression revealed a history of heart disease as an independent predictor of occult carotid artery disease (odds ratio 95 % confidence interval, 1. 4 - 4. 4). Type of heart disease was not a significant factor in predicting occult CAS. Direct cost of the screening, including community outreach, nurses, technicians, support staff, and miscellaneous expenses, was less than $ 75 per patient. ConclusionsIn a screening program for treatable causes of potential stroke, CAS was the most commonly diagnosed disease. More than one of every five patients with known hypertension and heart disease had occult CAS. Known heart disease of any type was a significant independent predictor of occult CAS. Screening for treatable causes of potential stroke can be cost-effective. This information could help to further target populations to screen for occult CAS and to justify reimbursement for screening carotid duplex scanning examinations...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{diagnostic}} {{value of the}} Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale, the Face Arm Speech Test, the Los Angeles Prehospital <b>Stroke</b> <b>Screen</b> and the Melbourne Ambulance <b>Stroke</b> <b>Screen</b> for identifying patients with an acute stroke in a prehospital setting in Belgium. METHODS: A prospective study was performed, using a questionnaire for every primarily transported patient within emergency medial service with relevant neurological complaints. Exclusion criteria were: patients below 18 years, trauma victims, Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 8 or transported to another hospital. The questionnaire is a comprehension of different stroke scales. RESULTS: The Face Arm Speech Test and Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale demonstrate a high sensitivity (95 %) but a lower specificity (33 %). The sensitivity of the Los Angeles Prehospital <b>Stroke</b> <b>Screen</b> and Melbourne Ambulance <b>Stroke</b> <b>Screen</b> was lower (74 %), but the specificity increased (83 and 67 %). Items investigating unilateral facial paralysis and unilateral loss/absence of motor response in upper extremities seemed to be most discriminating between the stroke group (68 - 78 %) and the nonstroke group (17 %), suggesting that items related to clinical assessment are more important in stroke recognition than history items. Combination of all clinical parameters of the different scores resulted in a sensitivity and specificity of 95 and 83 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results obtained {{in this study are}} comparable with earlier investigations. Given the limitations of the study, we could not identify the most adequate stroke scale.

40|$|Introduction: Comprehensive stroke {{systems of}} care include routing {{to the nearest}} {{designated}} stroke center hospital, bypassing non-designated hospitals. Routing protocols are implemented at the state or county level and vary in qualification criteria and determination of destination hospital. We surveyed all counties {{in the state of}} California for presence and characteristics of their prehospital stroke routing protocols. Methods: Each county’s local emergency medical services agency (LEMSA) was queried for the presence of a stroke routing protocol. We reviewed these protocols for method of stroke identification and criteria for patient transport to a stroke center. Results: Thirty-three LEMSAs serve 58 counties in California with populations ranging from 1, 175 to nearly 10 million. Fifteen LEMSAs (45 %) had stroke routing protocols, covering 23 counties (40 %) and 68 % of the state population. Counties with protocols had higher population density (1, 500 vs. 140 persons per square mile). In the six counties without designated stroke centers, patients meeting criteria were transported out of county. Stroke identification in the field was achieved using the Cincinnati Prehospital <b>Stroke</b> <b>Screen</b> in 72 %, Los Angeles Prehospital <b>Stroke</b> <b>Screen</b> in 7 % and a county-specific protocol in 22 %. Conclusion: California EMS prehospital acute stroke routing protocols cover 68 % of the state population and vary in characteristics including activation by symptom onset time and destination facility features, reflecting matching of system design to local geographic resources...|$|E

40|$|Driving {{assessments}} {{are carried out}} in various ways, and diverse methods and tests are used. The British <b>Stroke</b> Driver <b>Screening</b> Assessment (SDSA) is a cognitive test, developed to evaluate driving fitness in stroke patients. For Sweden, Denmark and Norway, there is a Nordic version, the Nordic <b>Stroke</b> Driver <b>Screening</b> Assessment (NorSDSA). This cognitive test has become commonly used by driving assessors and is sometimes the only test used to evaluate driving fitness regardless of a client’s diagnoses. The objective {{of the study was}} thus to compare the off-road NorSDSA test outcome, expressed as a global pass or fail result, with an on-road driving test outcome. The results showed that 52 out of 63 patients were correctly classified in the drivers-fail group and 24 of 57 in the pass group. In total, 63 % were correctly classified, (sensitivity 42 % and specificity 83 %). The NorSDSA is thus not a valid predictor for pass or fail on the on-road test. However, only a few neuropsychological tests are made for driving assessments. The NorSDSA is one of them, but driving assessors should know its apparent limitations.

40|$|Background : Paramedics {{require an}} {{effective}} prehospital tool to eliminate stroke mimics and {{to assist in}} the identification of suitable candidates for thrombolytic therapy. The Faster Access to Stroke Therapies study combined two validated stroke assessment tools (the Los Angeles Prehospital <b>Stroke</b> <b>Screen,</b> LAPSS, and the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale, CPSS) to form the Melbourne Ambulance <b>Stroke</b> <b>Screen</b> (MASS), and performed an in-field validation by Australian paramedics. Methods : Over a 12 -month period, 18 paramedics participated in the Faster Access to Stroke Therapies study and prospectively collected data contained in the MASS on all stroke dispatches, and for other patients with a focal neurological deficit. Sensitivity and specificity analysis of the LAPSS, CPSS and MASS was calculated and equivalence analysis performed. Results : Paramedics completed 100 MASS assessments for 73 (73 %) stroke/transient ischemic attack patients and 27 (27 %) stroke mimics. The sensitivity of the MASS (90 %, 95 % CI: 81 - 96 %) showed statistical equivalence to the sensitivity of the CPSS (95 %, p = 0. 45) and superiority to the LAPSS (78 %, p = 0. 008). The specificity of the MASS (74 %, 95 % CI: 53 - 88 %) was equivalent to that of the LAPSS (85 %, p = 0. 25) and superior to the CPSS (54 %, p = 0. 007). All patients misidentified by the MASS (7 strokes, 7 mimics) were ineligible for thrombolytic therapy. Conclusion : The MASS is simple to use, with accurate prehospital identification of stroke.

40|$|IntroductionPrior {{assessments}} of {{emergency medical services}} (EMS) stroke capacity found deficiencies in education and training, use of protocols and screening tools, and planning for the transport of patients. A 2001 survey of North Carolina EMS providers found many EMS systems lacked basic stroke services. Recent statewide efforts have sought to standardize and improve prehospital stroke care. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess EMS stroke care capacity in North Carolina and evaluate statewide changes since 2001. MethodsIn June 2012, we conducted a web-based survey on stroke education and training and stroke care practices and policies among all EMS systems in North Carolina. We used the McNemar test to assess changes from 2001 to 2012. ResultsOf 100 EMS systems in North Carolina, 98 responded to our survey. Most systems reported providing stroke education and training (95 %) to EMS personnel, using a validated stroke scale or screening tool (96 %), and having a hospital prenotification policy (98 %). Many were suboptimal in covering basic stroke educational topics (71 %), always communicating <b>stroke</b> <b>screen</b> results to the destination hospital (46 %), and always using a written destination plan (49 %). Among 70 EMS systems for which we had data for 2001 and 2012, we observed significant improvements in education on stroke scales or screening tools (61 % to 93 %, P <. 001) and use of validated stroke scales or screening tools (23 % to 96 %, P <. 001). ConclusionMajor improvements in EMS stroke care, especially in prehospital stroke screening, have occurred in North Carolina in the past decade, whereas other practices and policies, including use of destination plans, remain in need of improvement...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early and {{accurate}} diagnosis of stroke by {{emergency medical service}} (EMS) paramedics is critical for reducing pre-hospital delays. The Los Angeles pre-hospital <b>stroke</b> <b>screen</b> (LAPSS) has been widely used as a validated screening tool for early identifying stroke patients by EMS paramedics. However, validation of LAPSS has never been performed in Chinese stroke population. This study is aimed to verify the LAPSS for early identifying stroke patients in a Chinese urban EMS. METHODS: 76 paramedics of five urban first aid stations attached to Beijing 120 EMS were involved. The paramedics were trained by professionals to quickly screen patients based on LAPSS. Potential "target stroke" individuals who met the base LAPSS screen criteria were identified. Sensitivity and specificity analyses of the LAPSS were calculated. RESULTS: From June 10, 2009 to June 10, 2010, paramedics transported a total of 50, 220 patients. 1550 patients who met the baseline screen criteria were identified as the potential "target stroke" population. 1130 patients had the completed LAPSS information datasheet and 997 patients were clinically diagnosed with stroke. The average time of completing the LAPSS was 4. 3 ± 3. 0 minutes (median, 5 minutes). The sensitivity and specificity of the LAPSS {{in this study was}} 78. 44 % and 90. 22 %, respectively. After adjusting for age factor by excluding patients of > 45 years old, the sensitivity was significantly increased to 82. 95 % with specificity unchanged. CONCLUSION: The paramedics of Beijing 120 EMS could efficiently use LAPSS as a screening tool for early identifying stroke patients. While the sensitivity of LAPSS in Chinese urban patient population was lower than those reported in previous LAPSS validation studies, the specificity was consistent with these studies. After excluded the item of "Age> 45 years", the sensitivity was improved...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} for rendering animations in a painterly style. The difficulty in using existing still frame methods for animation {{is getting the}} paint to “stick ” to surfaces rather than randomly change with each frame, while still retaining a hand-crafted look. We extend the still frame method to animation by solving two major specific problems of previous techniques. First our method eliminates the “shower door ” effect in which an animation appears {{as if it were}} being viewed through textured glass because brush strokes stick to the viewplane not to the animating surfaces. Second, our technique provides for frame-to-frame coherence in animations so that the resulting frames do not randomly change every frame. To maintain coherence, we model surfaces as 3 d particle sets which are rendered as 2 d paint brush <b>strokes</b> in <b>screen</b> space much like an artist lays down brush strokes on a canvas. We use geometric and lighting properties of the surfaces to control the appearanceof brush strokes. This powerful combination of using 3 d particles, surface lighting information, and rendering 2 d brush <b>strokes</b> in <b>screen</b> space gives us the painterly style we desire and forces the brush strokes to stick to animating surfaces. By varying lighting and choosing brush stroke parameters we can create many varied painterly styles. We illustrate the method with images and animated sequences and present specific technical and creative suggestions for achieving different looks...|$|R
40|$|Background: In-flight medical {{emergencies}} {{are difficult}} to manage and medical volunteers can be valuable when these events occur. The study objective {{was to examine the}} role of medical volunteers in medical emergencies which resulted in medical flight diversions. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of medical diversions in a large Hong Kong commercial airline from December 2003 to November 2008. This study is derived from a database of in-flight medical events which has been previously reported. The presence of medical volunteers, the need for diversion, and the outcome for all in-flight medical events were recorded. The records of the medical diversion incidents were reviewed in detail and symptom-based categorization applied. Results: Medical volunteers were available in 1439 (35. 4 %) of the 4068 medical events and in 39 (84. 8 %) of the 46 cases which required medical diversions. Suspected stroke cases, as categorized under the nonspecific category, was the most common, followed by chest pains and deaths. Conclusions: Medical volunteers presented more often for more serious events, and {{may be due to the}} airline medical incident policy and medical legal concerns for volunteers. This study identified measures which may reduce medical diversions, including cabin crew training for <b>stroke</b> <b>screening,</b> and promote the use of the Medical Information Form (MEDIF) and indemnity forms. Recommendations for medical diversion may require more specialized training than is currently given in undergraduate medical courses, and may benefit from better communication with ground-based medical advice services...|$|R
40|$|Objective : The {{aim of the}} Faster Access to Stroke Therapy (FAST) {{study was}} to {{determine}} the effect of educational intervention andthe use of a prehospital stroke tool on the paramedic diagnosis of stroke. Methods : Paramedics in emergency medical service units servicing a university teaching hospital were divided into two groups: FAST study paramedics (n = 18) and non-FAST study paramedics (n = 43). The FAST study paramedics received stroke education and instruction in the use of a prehospital stroke assessment tool [Melbourne Ambulance <b>Stroke</b> <b>Screen</b> (MASS) ] to assist in stroke diagnosis. Based on final hospital diagnosis, the sensitivities of paramedic stroke diagnosis in the two groups were compared for a 12 -month period before andafter the intervention. Results : The sensitivity for the FAST study paramedics in identifying stroke improved from 78 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 63 % to 88 %) to 94 % (95 % CI: 86 % to 98 %) (p = 0. 006) after receiving the stroke education session and with use of the MASS tool. There was no change in stroke diagnosis for the non-study paramedics 78 % (95 % CI: 71 % to 84 %) to 80 % (95 % CI: 72 % to 87 %) (p = 0. 695). Prenotification of impending arrival to the emergency department was associated with higher-priority triage in the emergency department, and subsequent shorter times for door to medical review (15 min vs. 31 min, p < 0. 001) and door to computed tomography (CT) scanning (94 min vs. 144 min, p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Targeted stroke education and the use of a simple clinical tool can significantly improve the diagnostic sensitivity of stroke by paramedics in the prehospital setting. Accurate diagnosis combined with prenotification of the pending arrival of stroke patients will allow for the focused and timely application of resources for the management of acute stroke. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Objective. Prehospital care {{of stroke}} and chest pain {{patients}} {{is dependent on}} adequate emergency medical services (EMS) education and evidence-based protocols. We sought to describe the amount of education offered, community outreach implemented, and protocols established for stroke and for chest pain among North Carolina EMS agencies and personnel. Methods. A survey was developed to measure EMS system characteristics regarding the prehospital care of stroke and chest pain patients. Each of the 83 primary EMS agencies in North Carolina was asked to participate. Results. Of the 83 agencies surveyed, 72 (87 %) responded. Both advanced life support (ALS) and basic life support (BLS) services were provided by 54 % of agencies; 44 % offered ALS only and 1 % offered BLS only. While 89 % of the EMS agencies provided stroke education to EMS personnel and 96 % chest pain education to EMS personnel in the previous two years, the median hours devoted to stroke was one-half that for chest pain (6. 0 vs. 12. 0 hours, respectively). In the previous six months, 14 % of EMS agencies had conducted community outreach programs for stroke compared with 17 % for chest pain. The majority of EMS agencies had protocols specifically for managing stroke (83 %) andfor managing chest pain (99 %). Diagnostic scales to identify stroke patients were used by 54 % of agencies (20 % Los Angeles Prehospital <b>Stroke</b> <b>Screen,</b> 20 % Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale, and 14 % a locally developed scale). Thrombolytic checklists were used to identify eligible stroke patients at 37 % of the EMS agencies, compared with 28 % for eligible chest pain patients. Conclusions. In North Carolina, primary EMS agencies appear to have stroke and chest pain protocols in approximately the same frequency, yet their personnel receive only one-half as much education about stroke as they do about chest pain. Many stroke protocols were lacking basic components and would benefit from standardization across the state. Community outreach programs for both stroke and chest pain are minimal...|$|E

OBJECTIVES: The aims {{of this study were}} to 1) determine the rate of recruitment of community-dwelling stroke survivors into a randomized trial of the effects of strength training in addition to task-specific gait training, 2) compare the effectiveness of various recruitment strategies on accrual rates, and 3) determine the attendance at training sessions and adherence to the intervention protocol. METHODS: Participants within six months of a <b>stroke</b> were <b>screened</b> for eligibility and invited to participate. Recruitment strategies were classified as advertisement or referral. The number of people who were screened, eligible and recruited for each strategy was recorded. Attendance at training sessions and adherence to the intervention protocol were recorded. RESULTS: Over the first 14 months, 150 <b>stroke</b> survivors were <b>screened,</b> 10 were recruited, and 35 (23 %) were eligible. Twenty-five of these patients (71 %) were unable to participate with lack of transport given as the most common reason.

40|$|Objective: Stroke is {{the leading}} cause of death and disability, and is closely related to a lack of {{exercise}}. Currently, most Chinese medical staff members lack exercise and may be at risk for stroke. We sought to determine the risk factors for stroke and study the significance of health-related physical fitness testing in stroke prevention among Chinese medical staff members. Methods: A total of 627 subjects from Urumqi, Xinjiang, China, were included in the study and a survey was conducted from 1 st January 2016 to 1 st February 2016. <b>Stroke</b> <b>screening</b> and health-related physical fitness testing were completed according to the standard protocol, and the related data were analyzed. Results: Based on the screening, 27. 6 % (n =  173) of the subjects were at high risk for stroke. The top risk factors for stroke in these subjects were dyslipidemia, lack of exercise or mild physical activity, being overweight or obese, and high blood pressure. Body weight, body mass index, body fat, visceral fat area, body fat percentage, and basal metabolic rate were significantly higher (P <  0. 01) in subjects at high risk for stroke than in subjects who were not at high risk. Lung capacity, step index, grip test, vertical jump, and sit-up/push-up index were significantly lower (P <  0. 01) in subjects at high risk for stroke than in subjects who were not at high risk. Conclusions: A large proportion of China's on-the-job medical personnel is at high risk for stroke. This may be related to the nature of the profession and warrants more attention from the society. The health-related physical fitness measurement parameters in subjects at high risk for stroke were significantly different from those in subjects who were not at high risk. Screening and health-related physical fitness testing in medical staff members may contribute to stroke prevention. More rigorous controlled clinical trials will be needed in the future.

Subjects: Of 511 people with aphasia identified, 105 had low mood and were recruited. Interventions: Behavioural therapy was offered for up to three months. Outcomes were assessed three and six months after random allocation. Main measures: Stroke Aphasic Depression Questionnaire, Visual Analog Mood Scales ‘sad’ item, and Visual Analogue Self-Esteem Scale. Results: Participants were aged 29 to 94 years (mean 67. 0, SD 13. 5) and 66 (63...|$|R
500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{function of}} [...] "drawing" [...] or [...] "painting" [...] <b>strokes</b> on the <b>screen</b> led several journalists and gamers alike {{to believe that}} Ōkami would be well-suited for the Nintendo DS or Wii, both of which feature controls capable of creating drawing motions freely. After the game's release, industry rumors of the game being ported to either console persisted, despite Atsushi Inaba of Clover Studio feeling that Ōkamis action-based gameplay would not translate well to the console and statements from Capcom that there were [...] "no plans for Ōkami on Wii".|$|R
5000|$|The E74 error has {{sometimes}} {{been described as a}} [...] "Green Screen of Death" [...] and a [...] "Black Screen of Death" [...] because early versions of these errors had an almost jet-black background with a hue of dark green. Later versions would show a completely jet-black background. Reports of impending Q4 red-light failure stem from users who report an abnormal display with poor, grainy video as well as black dots or artifacts appearing on the screen. Vertical green or red <b>strokes</b> on the <b>screen</b> can also indicate an E74.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the potential for}} predicting driving performance of a United States (US) -based population of participants using an adapted version of the <b>Stroke</b> Drivers’ <b>Screening</b> Assessment (SDSA) battery. Participants included seven first-ever stroke survivors (age 51 ± 8 years) and 11 individuals with Hoehn 2 ̆ 6 Yahr Stage 2 or 3 Parkinson’s disease (PD) (age 65 ± 8 years). We adapted the original United Kingdom (UK) version of the SDSA to make it suitable {{for use in the}} US by replacing all UK-specific traffic situations and road signs with their US equivalents. Following administration of the adapted (US) version of the SDSA, stroke participants’ driving performance was evaluated in a driving simulator. PD participants’ driving performance was evaluated in the driving simulator as well as on-road. The pass/fail SDSA equations of the original UK version of the SDSA were applied to predict the pass/fail outcome of participants’ driving evaluation. The SDSA predicted stroke participants’ simulator-based driving performance with 100...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of Fabry disease in young patients with cryptogenic stroke. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively assessed {{the prevalence of}} Fabry disease in patients aged 16 - 60 years that were admitted to ZNA Middelheim Hospital from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2004 for cryptogenic <b>stroke.</b> We <b>screened</b> for Fabry disease by measurement of alpha-galactosidase A and beta-glucuronidase activity on blood spot. In all patients with abnormal enzymatic activity and in all female patients with low normal values, genetic sequencing of the alpha-GAL-gene was performed. RESULTS: In a population of 103 young patients with cryptogenic stroke that met the in- and exclusion criteria, {{we were unable to}} identify any patient with Fabry disease. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of alpha-galactosidase A and beta-glucuronidase activity, genetic sequencing and the low prevalence of clinical signs and symptoms of Fabry disease in this population, we believe that the true prevalence of Fabry disease in patients with cryptogenic stroke may be less than currently accepted in literature...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{protocol}} for a Cochrane Review (Diagnostic test accuracy). The objectives are as follows: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of bedside screening tools for detecting dysphagia, {{which is a}} predictor of aspiration, in people with acute stroke. To assess {{the influence of the}} following potential sources of heterogeneity. • Patient demographics (e. g. age, gender, percentage of males in study, median age of study by gender). • The time post-stroke that the study was conducted (from admission to 48 hours) to ensure only hyperacute and acute <b>stroke</b> dysphagia <b>screening</b> tools are identified. • Any significant change in the participant’s condition between the index and reference tests being performed. • The definition of dysphagia used by the study. • Level of training of nursing staff, both grade and training in the screening tool. • Low-quality studies identified from the methodological quality checklist. • Type of the index test and the threshold of the index test. • Type of the reference test...|$|R
