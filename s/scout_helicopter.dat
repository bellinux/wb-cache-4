5|$|Subsequently, the Army {{decided to}} pursue {{development}} of another battlefield <b>scout</b> <b>helicopter</b> under the Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter program; this resulted in another rotorcraft, designated as the Bell ARH-70, being selected and developed with the intention to replace the OH-58D {{in place of the}} Comanche. However, during October 2008, it was announced that the ARH-70 also met with cancellation, reportedly due to cost overruns on its development.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight test}} program was {{conducted}} using {{the pair of}} prototypes produced, which had been assigned the serial numbers 94-0327 and 95-0001. Following a demonstration {{of its ability to}} meet certain key criteria, on 1June2000, it was announced that the RAH-66 had entered the $3.1billion engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase of the program. Through the early 2000s, the U.S. Army maintained its plans for the intended purchase of over 1,200 Comanches, which were to fill both the <b>scout</b> <b>helicopter</b> and light attack roles; as late as 2003, it was being anticipated that deliveries of operational RAH-66s would commence as scheduled during 2006.|$|E

25|$|During the Battle of Goose Green, on 28 May, as Lieutenant Colonel H. Jones lay dying, his men radioed for urgent {{casualty}} evacuation. However, the <b>Scout</b> <b>helicopter</b> sent {{to evacuate}} Jones {{was shot down}} by an Argentine FMA IA 58 Pucara ground attack aircraft. The pilot, Lieutenant.

25|$|Since being {{introduced}} to service in 1973, the Gazelle has been procured and operated {{by a number of}} export customers. It has also participated in numerous conflicts around the world, including by Syria during the 1982 Lebanon War, by Rwanda during the Rwandan Civil War in the 1990s, and by numerous participants {{on both sides of the}} 1991 Gulf War. In French service, the Gazelle has been supplemented as an attack helicopter by the larger Eurocopter Tiger, but remains in use primarily as a <b>scout</b> <b>helicopter.</b>|$|E

25|$|Two Pucarás {{shot down}} a Royal Marines <b>Scout</b> <b>helicopter</b> with 7.62mm machine gun fire on 28 May, {{while it was}} on a {{casualty}} evacuation mission during the battle of Goose Green. This was the only confirmed Argentine air-to-air victory of the war. One of these Pucarás crashed into Blue Mountain on the return flight to Port Stanley and was destroyed—the body of the pilot (Lt. Gimenez) was found in 1986, and was buried with military honours at Port Darwin by his family, the first Argentine relatives to visit the Falklands {{since the end of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|Training {{and local}} {{operations}} in Japanese, Okinawan, and Philippine waters preceded yet another Vietnam deployment which commenced upon Terrell County's arrival at Vũng Tàu on 8 May 1969. The next day, she relieved Westchester County {{and found that}} the tempo of operations in the lower Cà Mau peninsula had increased. With 50 men of the Mobile Strike Force embarked, as well as a U.S. Army <b>scout</b> <b>helicopter</b> and a U.S. Navy Underwater Demolition Team (UDT) detachment, Terrell County provided support for multifaceted operations designed to destroy Viet Cong factories, training and supply camps, and extortion stations. She remained on station in the Cà Mau region until 25 June.|$|E
500|$|The Army is {{implementing}} {{a plan to}} move all Apaches from the Army Reserve and National Guard to the active Army to serve as scout helicopters to replace the OH-58 Kiowa. Using the AH-64 to scout would be less expensive than Kiowa upgrades or purchasing a new <b>scout</b> <b>helicopter.</b> AH-64Es can control UAVs like the MQ-1C Grey Eagle to perform aerial scouting missions; a 2010 study found the teaming of Apaches and UAVs was the most cost-effective alternative to a new helicopter and would meet 80 percent of reconnaissance requirements, compared to 20 percent with existing OH-58s and 50 percent with upgraded OH-58s. National Guard units, who would lose their attack helicopters, criticized the proposal. [...] In March 2015, the first heavy attack reconnaissance unit was formed with 24 Apaches and 12 Shadow UAVs.|$|E
