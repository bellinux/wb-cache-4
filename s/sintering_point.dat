Their high quality, the existence of standards and the affordability are the main reasons. Together with this there is of course an appreciable need for decreasing of energy consumption, carbon dioxide emissions and utilization of secondary raw materials. The roman cement is the possible answer to all of these requests. This historically experienced hydraulic binder, relatively less demanding for the quality of the raw material, is fired by the temperature below the <b>sintering</b> <b>point</b> and even though it does not achieve as good mechanical properties as the portland cement does, in some applications it could be re-established.

For fly ash complete retention is achieved by operating the filter at 1000 DEGREESC, near the <b>sintering</b> <b>point</b> of the ash.

40|$|Issue: It is {{very simple}} to fuse {{recycled}} container glass to make tiles and relief plaques. However, information on raw material characteristics, temperature profiles, and operational issues has not been widely disseminated. Best Practice: At temperatures considerably below melting, particles of metal, ceramics, or glass begin to bond through a process called sintering. Sintering of soda-lime glass begins at about 1250 ° F. Sintering {{can be used to}} create solid glass objects by heating glass particles to above the <b>sintering</b> <b>point</b> and holding at that temperature until a dense body forms. The basic steps are described below: 1) Obtain a mold that will withstand temperatures of at least 1600 °F. For instructions on casting permanent molds, see Permanent Molds for Fusing Glass Best Practice. Coat the mold with a release. Commercial “shelf paints ” are available. A mixture of 40 % kaolin and 60 % alumina hydrate also works well. 2) Fill the mold with glass pieces. Glass of any size can be used. However, the most consistent success has been obtained with glass that has been crushed to a uniform shape and screened to a size 16 mesh and finer. There is a trade-off here between glass grain size and cleanliness. It is easier to obtain a glassy, translucent product with larger grain sizes, but smaller grain sizes minimize contamination. 3) Fire the kiln to fusing temperatures. For green or amber container glass, the following schedule is a place to start: 500 °F/hour to 1100 °F (organic contamination should be gone by this point) 500 °F/hour to 1600 °F (or go as fast as the kiln will rise) soak 5 minutes at 1600 °F (this is the critical time & temp – experiment) Natural cooling to 1020 °F Soak 15 minutes at 1020 °F (may need longer soak for thick or uneven pieces) 70 °F/hour to 950 °F Cool 300 °F/hour to 250 °F Open kiln to cool to ambient Each kiln acts differently. The maximum temperature that works best in a particular kiln may be anywhere from 1500 to 1600 °F. Fusing can also be done in cone kilns. Fire at maximum and try cone 010, 011, 012, and 013.

40|$|During water-atomisation and {{handling}} of steel powder the surface inevitably oxidises. The surface bound oxide {{is an important}} factor in the processing of powder metallurgical (PM) steels, especially in case the powder contains elements forming stable oxides, such as Cr, Mn, and Si. The surface products formed on the metallic particles may obstruct the sintering due to inadequate metallic contact between the particles. Hence, insufficient sintering may lead to limited bonding between metallic particles as well as entrapment of residual oxides in the final component. Consequently the mechanical properties of the final component are lowered. In order to understand and control the surface reactions during sintering, it is important to know the composition, morphology and amount of oxides that are present on the powder surface. Furthermore, it is vital to understand the parameters influencing the surface reactions during pressing and sintering. In the sintering stage, at least partial surface oxide reduction has to be onset in order to facilitate sintering and neck growth. An overall aim of research in this field is to achieve high density (close to theoretical density of steel) in order to compete with traditionally fabricated materials. When density is increased, the surface reactions is even more crucial, since the sintering gas into the component, as well as the reduction products out of the component may be restricted due to the low degree of open porosity in the compact. This work deal with surface product formation on Cr-alloyed water-atomised PM steel. By applying surface sensitive analytical tools, such as AES and XPS, in combination with microscopy it was found that the surface oxide on powder particles were consisting of a thin layer of Fe-rich oxide with particulates of thermodynamically stable oxides (e. g. Cr-, Mn-, and Si-oxides). This was actually found to be beneficial from a <b>sintering</b> <b>point</b> of view, since sintering starts at the Fe-oxide, which is easily reduced compared to the Cr-, Mn- and Si-oxides. Sintered materials (1120 ºC- 1250 ºC) were analysed by fractographic analyses (fracture in UHV) using AES and SEM. It was shown that the particulate surface oxide grow during the sintering stage (from about 0. 1 µm to 1 µm), whereas the thin oxide is reduced. It was also found that there is a transformation from more Cr-rich particulates to more Si-rich ones during sintering. Hence, Si, which is a trace element in the material, act as a deoxidiser of the metal particles during sintering. This was also evident by model experiments where the initial stage of sintering by annealing powder in vacuum and reducing atmosphere (H 2 /N 2 - 10 / 90) at 800 ºC - 1000 ºC,. By these experiments it was observed that the relatively stable oxides grow on expense of the less stable ones at early stage of sintering...|$|E

The measurements were performed at 4. 2 K in a sinusoidal field of amplitude 400 mT at frequencies of 1 to 90 mHz (no DC-bias field) that was applied both perpendicular and parallel to the face of the cable (the face-on, FO, and edge-on, EO, directions, respectively).

Physical vapour deposition produces the purest films on suitable substrates, and now has been investigated further for preparing nickel, chromium and nichrome films having the most reproducible electrical properties. A more precise determination of the crystal structure and reactivity of these films affords closer product control, so that the sintering of the films and their oxidation by oxygen, carbon dioxide or air has been studied by X-ray, optical and electronmicropgrapic and gas sorption techniques. Of the metal films vapour deposited on mioa and glass substrates, only the nichrome films show any tendency to grow epitaxially. The metal films sinter appreciably above temperatures of about one-third of the melting point in degrees absolute, at which surface diffusion is operative to promote grain-boundary penetration. Thus, the nichrome films with the lowest melting <b>point</b> <b>sinter</b> more readily than the nickel or chromium. Sintering is enhanced by increased temperature and becomes extensive above the Tammann temperature (about half the melting point in degrees absolute) when it is promoted also by crystal lattice diffusion. The metal films are oxidised when heated in oxygen, carbon dioxide, or air. Their sintering and oxidation behaviours are compared with that of the metals and their oxides in bulk and changes in phase composition, surface area, crystallite and aggregate mixes, are correlated with experimental conditions such as time and temperature. The electrical properties of the metal films depend strongly on their crystallinity. The nichrome (compared with the nickel and chromium) films conform more closely to the bulk metal properties and are more adherent to non-metallic substrates. Their resistance and resistivity are more uniform and less variable with temperature.

Initial baseline data {{representative of the}} state-of-the-art of thermal spray deposition of WC-Co coatings was established using Diamalloy™ 2003, a premium grade WC-Co powder, and a Sulzer-Metco Diamond Jet™ (DJ) system. An increased understanding of the HVOF thermal spray process was established via a correlation of DJ process variables to the mechanisms of WC-Co coating defect formation. The critical HVOF process variables were identified as WC-Co particle size, DJ gun-to-substrate distance, DJ gun translation velocity, and powder feed rate, and a mechanism for controlled porosity formation in coatings was identified. These data were used to formulate a HVOF optimizing procedure which was used for DJ thermal spray of nWC-Co coatings. ^ As-synthesized nWC-Co particles are hollow shells with diameters of 25 – 125 μm. Incomplete matrix melting of as-synthesized nWC-Co occurred during W thermal spray and indicated the need for higher density particles. Heat treatments at 900 – 1400 °C reveal that insignificant densification of the hollow shell nWC-Co particles occurred prior to their <b>sintering</b> at contact <b>points,</b> and indicated that mechanical reprocessing was required. To this end a process using ultrasonic disintegration of nWC-Co powder and spray dry re-agglomeration was developed. ^ DJ thermal spray of reprocessed nWC-Co and nWC-Co+VC (vanadium carbide is a WC grain growth inhibitor) powders demonstrated that VC did not effect nWC grain size of coatings. DJ thermal sprayed nWC-Co coatings were near fully dense with a mean WC grain size of ∼ 200 nm, but displayed extensive nWC oxidation. The addition of 2. 5 and 5 wt % C during reprocessing of nWC- 8 Co powder significantly lowered the oxidation of nWC during DJ thermal spray. Addition of 5 wt % C produced a slightly lower nWC- 8 Co coating hardness than 2. 5 wt% C, due to η carbide formation. The W thermal spray of nWC- 8 Co- 2. 5 C powder using nitrogen DJ gun cooling demonstrated that exclusion of oxygen from the cooling gas caused a significant additional reduction in the oxidation of nWC, yielding a coating hardness value superior to Diamalloy 2003 coatings. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} performed to determine the effect of selective laser sintering parameters such as power output, laser distance between the <b>point’s</b> <b>sintered</b> metal powder during additive manufacturing as well as the orientation of the model relative to the laser beam and substrate on the surface quality of the model. Design/methodology/approach: In research the device for the selective laser sintering of metal powders Renishaw AM 125 machine was used. On the basis of an experiment plan, 24 models sample was made, which were tested to determine the surface roughness and thus describe an influence of process parameters on the model and the orientation of the surface quality. Research model was developed and manufactured with the Autofab software, and then imported into the machine, which, based on the plan of the experiment carry out models. Findings: On the basis of studies {{it was found that the}} surface quality models using 316 L stainless steel with the assumed parameters of the experiment depends on the process parameters used during the selective laser sintering method as well as the orientation of formed walls of the model relative to the substrate and thus the laser beam. Research limitations/implications: Studies were carried out to determine the effects of only two parameters on the quality of surface. In the following, it is planned to perform metallographic studies to determine the effect of process parameters on the mechanical properties and the structure executed models. In the future planned are the investigations on the influence of laser parameters such as speed, focus offset, exposure time, diameter of laser beam and hatch parameters such as hatch type, distance and hatch distance on the quality of the elements structure and mechanical properties as well. Practical implications: Making models of metallic powders by selective laser sintering allows quickly designing and building functional models and equipment, quick verification of the project without opportunity to incur significant costs to the complex and expensive tools. Originality/value: While SLM can be used as a rapid prototyping process, it is extremely useful as a direct manufacturing process able to produce extremely complex parts with different surface quality which would be impossible to produce by other means. The ability to produce almost any 3 D shape gives engineers complete design freedom...|$|R
