40|$|Memory latency {{tolerant}} architectures support {{thousands of}} in-flight instructions without scaling cyclecritical processor resources, {{and thousands of}} useful instructions can complete in parallel with a miss to memory. These architectures however require large queues to track all loads and stores executed while a miss is pending. Hierarchical designs alleviate cycle time impact of these structures but the CAM and search functions required to enforce memory ordering and provide data forwarding place high demand on area and power. We present new load-store processing algorithms for latency tolerant architectures. We augment primary load and store queues with secondary buffers. The secondary load buffer is a set associative structure, similar to a cache. The <b>secondary</b> <b>store</b> buffer, the Store Redo Log, is a first-in first-out structure recording the program order of all stores completed in parallel with a miss, and has no CAM and search functions. Instead of the <b>secondary</b> <b>store</b> queue, a cache provides temporary forwarding. The SRL enforces memory ordering by ensuring memory updates occur in program order once the miss returns. The new algorithms eliminate the CAM and search functions in the secondary load and store buffers, and remove fundamental sources of complexity, power, and area inefficiency in load/store processing. The new organization, while being area and power efficient, is competitive in performance compared to hierarchical designs. 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} method for the {{analysis}} of <b>secondary</b> metabolites <b>stored</b> in glandular trichomes, employing negative ion `chip-based` nanospray tandem mass spectrometry. The analyses of glandular trichomes from Lychnophora ericoides, a plant endemic to the Brazilian `cerrado` and used in traditional medicine as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent, led to the identification of five flavonoids (chrysin, pinocembrin, pinostrobin, pinobanksin and 3 -O-acetylpinobanksin) by direct infusion of the extracts of glandular trichomes into the nanospray ionisation source. All the flavonoids have no oxidation at ring B, which resulted in a modification of the fragmentation pathways compared with that of the oxidised 3, 4 -dihydroflavonoids already described in the literature. The absence of the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant di-C-glucosylflavone vicenin- 2, or any other flavonoid glycosides, in the glandular trichomes was also demonstrated. The use of the,`chip-based` nanospray QqTOF apparatus is a new fast and useful tool for the identification of <b>secondary</b> metabolites <b>stored</b> in the glandular trichomes, which can be useful for chemotaxonomic studies based on metabolites from glandular trichomes.

40|$|Objective Neighbourhood {{differences}} in access to {{fresh fruit and}} vegetables may explain social inequalities in diet. Investigations have focused on variations in cost and availability as barriers to the purchase and consumption of fresh produce; investigations of quality have been neglected. Here we investigate whether produce quality systematically varies by food store type, rural–urban location and neighbourhood deprivation in a selection of communities across Scotland. Design Cross-sectional survey of twelve fresh fruit and vegetable items in 288 food stores in ten communities across Scotland. Communities were selected to reflect a range of urban–rural settings and a food retail census was conducted in each location. The quality of twelve fruit and vegetable items within each food store was evaluated. Data from the Scottish Executive were used to characterise each small area by deprivation and urban–rural classification. Setting Scotland. Results Quality of fruit and vegetables within the surveyed stores was high. Medium-sized stores, stores in small town and rural areas, and stores in more affluent areas tended to have the highest-quality {{fresh fruit and vegetables}}. Stores where food is <b>secondary,</b> <b>stores</b> in urban settings and stores in more deprived areas tended have the lowest-quality fresh produce. Although {{differences in}} quality were not always statistically significant, patterns were consistent for the majority of fruit and vegetable items. Conclusions The study provides evidence that variations in food quality may plausibly be a micro-environmental mediating variable in food purchase and consumption and help partially explain neighbourhood differences in food consumption patterns. <br/...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) is a {{universal}} Ca 2 + mobilizing second messenger. In T cells cADPR is involved in sustained Ca 2 + release and also in Ca 2 + entry. Potential mechanisms for the latter include either capacitative Ca 2 + entry <b>secondary</b> to <b>store</b> depletion by cADPR or direct activation of the non-selective cation channel transient receptor potential – melastatin type 2 (TRPM 2). Here we characterize the molecular target of the newly-described membrane-permeant cADPR agonist 8 -bromo-cyclic inosine diphosphoribose (8 -Br-N 1 -cIDPR). 8 -Br-N 1 -cIDPR evoked Ca 2 + signalling in the human T-lymphoma cell line Jurkat and in primary rat T-lymphocytes. Ca 2 + signalling induced by 8 -Br-N 1 -cIDPR consisted of Ca 2 + release and Ca 2 + entry. While Ca 2 + release was sensitive to both the ryanodine receptor blocker ruthenium red and the cADPR antagonist 8 -bromo-cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose (8 -Br-cADPR), Ca 2 + entry was inhibited by the Ca 2 + entry blockers Gd 3 + and SKF 96365 {{as well as by}} 8 -Br-cADPR. To unravel a potential role for TRPM 2 in sustained Ca 2 + entry evoked by 8 -Br-N 1 -cIDPR, TRPM 2 was overexpressed in HEK 293 cells. However, though activation by hydrogen peroxide was enhanced dramatically in those cells, Ca 2 + signalling induced by 8 -Br-N 1 -cIDPR was almost unaffected. Similarly, direct analysis of TRPM 2 currents did not reveal activation or co-activation of TRPM 2 by 8 -Br-N 1 -cIDPR. In summary, the sensitivity to the Ca 2 + entry blockers Gd 3 + and SKF 96365 is in favour of the concept of capacitative Ca 2 + entry <b>secondary</b> to <b>store</b> depletion by 8 -Br-N 1 -cIDPR. Taken together, 8 -Br-N 1 -cIDPR appears to be the first cADPR agonist affecting Ca 2 + release (and secondary Ca 2 + entry), but without effect on TRPM 2...|$|R

40|$|Warning signal {{variation}} is ubiquitous but paradoxical: low variability should aid recognition and learning by predators. However, spatial {{variability in the}} direction and strength of selection for individual elements of the warning signal may allow phenotypic variation for some components, but not others. Variation in selection may occur if predators only learn particular colour pattern components rather than the entire signal. Here, we used a nudibranch mollusc, Goniobranchus splendidus, which exhibits a conspicuous red spot/white body/yellowrim colour pattern, to test this hypothesis. We first demonstrated that <b>secondary</b> metabolites <b>stored</b> within the nudibranch were unpalatable to a marine organism.

Yellow rims remained stable in the presence of high genetic divergence among populations.

40|$|Abstract—Future routers {{will not}} only forward data packets but also provide {{value-added}} services, such as security, accounting, caching, and resource management. These services can be implemented as general programs, to be invoked by traversing packets embedding router program calls. Software programmable routers pose new challenges {{in the design of}} router operating systems (OS). First, router programs will require access to diverse system resources. The resource demands of a large community of heterogeneous resource consumers must either be coordinated to enable cooperation or arbitrated to resolve competition. Second, it is beneficial to concurrently support multiple virtual machines, each with a guaranteed share of physical resources. This allows services to be customized and to seamlessly evolve. We present the design and implementation of a next generation router OS that can meet the above challenges. We define an orthogonal kernel abstraction of resource allocation, which can schedule various time-shared and space-shared resources with quality of service (QoS) differentiation and guarantees. A scalable and flexible packet classifier enables dynamic resource binding and per-flow processing of received packets. We have prototyped our system on a network of UltraSPARC and Pentium II computers. Currently, QoS-aware schedulers for CPU time, forwarding bandwidth, memory-store capacity, and capacity for <b>secondary</b> data <b>stores</b> have been integrated.

This in turn requires reliable power supply, mainly in the form of primary or <b>secondary</b> batteries <b>storing</b> energy to supply the various functional discrete components along with accurate prediction of sensor node life time, based on estimated state of charge of the energy source. The paper presents two approaches for energy modeling of sensor node life time in ambient monitoring scenarios concerned with periodical sampling of measurable parameters from the indoor environment. The analytical approach involves modeling the individual components of a sensor node and carrying out simulations in different duty-cycling regimes to obtain an expected life time. Experimental modeling has also been carried out over short and medium term repeatable deployments in order to gather meaningful sets of data suitable for statistical interpretation. Battery discharge characteristics are determined in order to extract high level information used in system design for indoor ambient monitoring. final goal is to incorporate validated experimental results back into simulation approaches and enable a prediction framework for the Memsic IRIS XM 2110 motes in order to approach the direct and inverse problem: accurately determine node life time for various sampling and communication regimes or choose optimal configuration parameters for an imposed node life time.
