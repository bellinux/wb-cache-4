40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] Background. The objective {{of the current study}} was to measure dietary diversity in South Africans aged 16 years and older from all population groups as a proxy of food security. Methods. A cross-sectional study representative of adults from all specified ages, provinces, geographic localities, and socio-economic strata in South Africa was used (n = 3287). Trained interviewers visited participants at their homes during the survey. Dietary data was collected by means of a face validated 24 hour recall which was not quantified. A dietary diversity score (DDS) was calculated by counting each of 9 food groups. A DDS < 4 was regarded as reflecting poor dietary diversity and poor food security. Results The provinces with the highest prevalence of poor dietary diversity (DDS < 4) were Limpopo (61. 8 %) and the Eastern Cape (59. 6 %). By contrast, only 15. 7 % of participants in Western Cape had a low score. Participants in tribal areas (63. 9 %) and informal urban areas (55. 7 %) were by far the worst affected. There were significant differences in DDS by Living Standards Mean (LSM) analysis (p < 0. 05) with the lowest LSM group having the lowest mean DDS (2. 93). The most commonly consumed food groups were cereals/roots; meat/fish; dairy and vegetables other than <b>vitamin</b> A <b>rich.</b> Eggs, legumes, and <b>vitamin</b> A <b>rich</b> fruit and vegetables were the least consumed.

Methods: It was a cross sectional study conducted in Khirasara village of Rajkot district from January to April 2015. Out of total 196 mothers of pre-school children in the village, 98 (50 % of the total after convenient sampling) were selected. Ninety five mothers consented and gave complete response.

Materials and Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial in which 100 postmenopausal women aged 40 - 60 years were recruited and assigned to two groups (50 each in the intervention and control groups). Food frequency consumption was measured using a questionnaire.

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess dark adaptation threshold of {{pregnant women}} and related socio-demographic factors in Damot Sore District, Wolayita Zone, Southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was employed to collect data from 104 pregnant women selected by a two stage cluster sampling. A Dietary Diversity Score was calculated by counting the number of food groups consumed by the women in 24 hour period prior to the study. Scotopic Sensitivity Tester- 1 was used to test participant’s pupillary response to graded amounts of light in a dark tent. RESULTS: Half of the pregnant women in this study had dietary diversity score less than three. The majority of participants (87. 5 %) had consumed either animal or plant source <b>vitamin</b> A <b>rich</b> foods less than three times a week. For a unit increase in individual dietary diversity score, there was a decrease in dark adaptation measurement by 0. 29 log cd/m 2 (p= 0. 001).

Student’s two-tailed paired t test and one-way ANOVA with Scheffé corrected Post hoc test was used to determine significant methylation and expression differences. Two-tailed Pearson test was used to determine correlations between methylation level, gene expression, and DNA strand break amount. Results The intervention resulted in significantly higher CpG methylation in two particular MLH 1 promoter regions and the MGMT promoter. DNA strand breaks and methylation levels correlated significantly. The expression of MLH 1, DNMT 1, and the promoter methylation of MSH 2 remained stable. CpG methylation levels and gene expression did not correlate. Conclusion This <b>vitamin</b> and antioxidant <b>rich</b> diet affected the CpG methylation of MLH 1. The higher methylation might be a result of the ROS scavenging antioxidant rich diet, leading to lower activity of DNA demethylating enzymes. Our results suggest the hypothesis of CpG demethylation via DNA repair enzymes under these circumstances.
