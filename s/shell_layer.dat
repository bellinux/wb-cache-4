50|$|Early, {{primitive}} rostroconchs such as Ribeiroia had a hinge {{in which}} all <b>shell</b> <b>layers</b> covered the dorsal region resulting in a very rigid shell. In Conocardium, a more advanced rostroconch, the outer <b>shell</b> <b>layers</b> do not cross the entire margin, suggesting independent steps towards the bivalve flexible hinge.|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{experimental}} results described above, several new phenomena have been discovered. First, {{instead of the}} common axial growth, GaSb adopts a lateral growth mode, thus forming <b>shell</b> <b>layers</b> on GaAs core NWs. Second, unlike the widely reported ZB structure for GaSb NWs, GaSb <b>shell</b> <b>layers</b> form a WZ phase. Thirdly, there undergoes a structural transition from WZ to ZB structure when GaSb <b>shell</b> <b>layers</b> change to top bulgy GaSb nanoplates. We believe that these new phenomena may stem from the change of underlying growth mechanism of GaSb segment.|$|R

30|$|The ZnO NRAs were {{synthesized}} on (100) Si wafers by aqueous chemical growth. Before the synthesis, a 50 -nm-thick ZnO {{seed layer}} was deposited on the wafer at {{a temperature of}} 180 °C by ALD. Diethylzinc and H 2 O vapors were used as the precursors for zinc and oxygen, respectively. After the ALD deposition, the seed layer was treated by rapid thermal annealing at 950 °C for 5 min in nitrogen atmosphere to improve its crystal quality. Afterwards, the ZnO NRAs were grown in 320 ml aqueous solution, containing 10 mM zinc nitrate hexahydrate and 5 ml ammonia solution, at 95 °C for 2 h. More details of ZnO NRA synthesis have been described elsewhere [31, 32]. Finally, Al 2 O 3 and ZnO <b>shell</b> <b>layers</b> were prepared by the ALD on the as-grown ZnO NRAs to fabricate ZnO/Al 2 O 3 and ZnO/ZnO core-shell NRAs. The precursors for Al 2 O 3 deposition were trimethylaluminum and H 2 O vapors, and the deposition temperature was 180 °C. The Al 2 O 3 <b>shell</b> <b>layers</b> were 2, 5, and 10 nm in thickness. The ALD condition of ZnO <b>shell</b> <b>layers</b> {{was the same as}} that of the ZnO seed layer. The thicknesses of ZnO <b>shell</b> <b>layers</b> were 5, 10, and 15 nm, respectively.

Result revealed that the egg production, egg weight, final body weight, feed consumption, shell weight, age at first laying, feed cost, management cost, and net profit varied significantly due to different birds and different management system. Under intensive system Hybrid Layer rearing were better than Native Hen showed moderate performance in terms of higher egg production, higher weight of egg, higher body weight and lower mortality. Feed conversion efficiency, production number of eggs, egg mass, net profit and survivability was higher in White <b>Shelled</b> Hybrid <b>Layers</b> than Brown <b>Shelled</b> Hybrid <b>Layers</b> under intensive system. Under scavenging system NH was better also for the rural area of Bangladesh, because of lower production cost, higher market price of eggs, live bird price and good profit. Rural poultry plays a vital role in the existing farming systems of Bangladesh. It can be recommended here that the Native Hen farming under scavenging system without any investment and White <b>Shelled</b> Hybrid <b>Layer</b> or Brown <b>Shelled</b> Hybrid <b>Layer</b> i. e. any one under intensive system farming are obvious for efficient and profitable egg production in Bangladesh...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the modeling the drying process of <b>shell</b> mould <b>layering</b> {{process for the}} ceramic shell mould fabrication process. As this process involves the repeated drying of the different wetted/saturated layers, therefore modeling of this phenomena involve a sequent approach to tackle the whole development of <b>shell</b> mould <b>layering</b> process. In this work an Ab-Initia approach {{was selected as the}} best simulation technique to map the drying mechanism.

40|$|We {{systematically}} studied {{electrical resistivity}} and magnetoresistance (MR) of size-monodispersed oxide-coated Fe cluster assemblies with the mean cluster sizes of d = 9 - 17 nm prepared by a plasma-gas-condensation-type cluster beam deposition system. The electrical resistivity and magnetoresistance strongly {{depend on the}} temperature, surface oxidization degree of the clusters (namely O- 2 gas flow ratio R-O 2), Fe cluster size d, and magnetic field. The oxide-coated Fe cluster assemblies exhibit a large negative MR effect which is further enhanced at low temperatures due to the dominant contribution of the spin-dependent tunneling process between the Fe cores through the oxide <b>shell</b> <b>layers.</b> It {{has been found that}} the magnetic field dependence of the MR ratio at all temperatures shows no saturation tendency up to a maximum field H = 50 kOe and completely disagrees with the magnetization curves which indicate a saturation tendency. These results have been interpreted by consideration of the magnetic state of the Fe-oxide <b>shell</b> <b>layers,</b> spin-dependent tunneling mechanism, and intercluster magnetic correlation. The high-field nonsaturation behavior in the magnetoresistance effect is attributed to the spin-disordered structure, which is frozen in a spin-glass-like state at low temperatures, in the surface of the Fe-oxide shell crystallites or the whole thinner Fe-oxide <b>shell</b> <b>layers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Bivalve {{shell is}} a biomineralized tissue with various layers/microstructures and {{excellent}} mechanical properties. Shell matrix proteins (SMPs) pervade and envelop the mineral crystals and play essential roles in biomineralization. Despite that Mytilus is an economically important bivalve, only few proteomic {{studies have been}} performed for the shell, and current knowledge of the SMP set responsible for different <b>shell</b> <b>layers</b> of Mytilus remains largely patchy. In this study, we observed that Mytilus galloprovincialis <b>shell</b> contained three <b>layers,</b> including nacre, fibrous prism, and myostracum that is involved in shell-muscle attachment. A parallel proteomic analysis was performed for these three layers. By combining LC-MS/MS analysis with Mytilus EST database interrogations, {{a whole set of}} 113 proteins was identified, and the distribution of these proteins in different <b>shell</b> <b>layers</b> followed a mosaic pattern. For each layer, about a half of identified proteins are unique and the others are shared by two or all of three layers. This is the first description of the protein set exclusive to nacre, myostracum, and fibrous prism in Mytilus shell. Moreover, most of identified proteins in the present study are novel SMPs, which greatly extended biomineralization-related protein data of Mytilus. These results are useful, on one hand, for understanding the roles of SMPs in the deposition of different <b>shell</b> <b>layers.</b> On the other hand, the identified protein set of myostracum provides candidates for further exploring the mechanism of adductor muscle-shell attachment...|$|R
