5|$|On {{arriving}} in England, Plagis {{was found to}} be suffering from malnutrition, <b>scabies</b> and physical and mental fatigue. He briefly convalesced in a nursing home, then spent a year as an instructor in England. He was promoted to probationary flying officer on 1 October 1942.|$|E
5|$|Commissioned in {{the field}} as a second {{lieutenant}} on 29 September 1917, Maxwell {{took part in the}} engagements around , Belgium, the following month. He earned promotion to lieutenant on 1 January 1918 and was admitted to the 7th Australian Field Ambulance on 10 January suffering <b>scabies.</b> Having been discharged from the hospital, he rejoined the 18th Battalion on 17 January.|$|E
5|$|In October 1944, the Frank {{women were}} {{scheduled}} to join a transport to the Liebau labour camp in Upper Silesia. Bloeme Evers-Emden {{was scheduled to be}} on this transport, but Anne was prohibited from going because she had developed <b>scabies,</b> and her mother and sister opted to stay with her. Bloeme went on without them.|$|E
5|$|Bloeme was {{deported}} to Auschwitz {{on the last}} train leaving Westerbork on 3 September 1944. On the same train were the Frank family who had been discovered in hiding on 4 August. Bloeme saw Anne, Margot and their mother regularly in Auschwitz, although {{she was part of}} a separate group of eight women who stayed together, encouraging and helping one another. In October 1944, Bloeme and her group were selected for transfer to the Liebau labor camp in Upper Silesia. For the filming of the 1995 BBC documentary Anne Frank Remembered, Bloeme recalled that Anne, Margot, and their mother, Edith, also planned to join the transport, but Anne was prohibited from joining because she had developed <b>scabies.</b> Her mother and sister opted to stay with her, and Bloeme went on without them. Bloeme was also interviewed for her remembrances of the Frank women in Auschwitz in the 1988 television documentary The Last Seven Months of Anne Frank by Dutch filmmaker Willy Lindwer.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{negative}} effects of poison, which were so evident in these times, cures were being found in poison, even at such a time where it was hated by the most of the general public. An example {{can be found in the}} works of Iranian born Persian physician, philosopher, and scholar Rhazes, writer of Secret of Secrets, which was a long list of chemical compounds, minerals and appratus, the first man to distil alcohol and use it as an anti-septic, and the person who suggested mercury be used as a laxative. He made discoveries relating to a mercury chloride called corrosive sublimate. An ointment derived from this sublimate was used to cure what Rhazes described as 'the itch', which is now referred to as <b>scabies.</b> This proved an effective treatment because of mercury's poisonous nature and ability to penetrate the skin, allowing it to eliminate the disease and the itch.|$|E
5|$|On 5 August 1999, a Haringey social worker, Barry Almeida, took Climbié to an NSPCC centre in Tottenham, {{where she}} was {{assigned}} to Sylvia Henry. There was some confusion {{as to why the}} centre was being referred to for the case. Henry later contacted Almeida and was told, according to Henry, that Climbié had moved out of the borough, thereby closing the case. Almeida said he could not remember whether this conversation did take place. On the same day, Kouao met Arthurworrey and Jones at the Haringey social services department, and claimed that Climbié had poured boiling water over herself to stop the itching caused by the <b>scabies</b> and that she had used utensils to cause the other injuries. The social worker and police officer believed her, deciding that the injuries were probably accidental, and allowed Climbié to return home the following day, which she did.|$|E
5|$|With {{the other}} females not {{selected}} for immediate death, Frank {{was forced to}} strip naked to be disinfected, had her head shaved, and was tattooed with an identifying number on her arm. By day, the women were used as slave labour and Frank was forced to haul rocks and dig rolls of sod; by night, they were crammed into overcrowded barracks. Some witnesses later testified Frank became withdrawn and tearful when she saw children being led to the gas chambers; others reported that more often she displayed strength and courage. Her gregarious and confident nature allowed her to obtain extra bread rations for her mother, sister, and herself. Disease was rampant; before long, Frank's skin became badly infected by <b>scabies.</b> The Frank sisters were moved into an infirmary, which {{was in a state}} of constant darkness and infested with rats and mice. Edith Frank stopped eating, saving every morsel of food for her daughters and passing her rations to them through a hole she made at the bottom of the infirmary wall.|$|E
5|$|After {{an idyllic}} period, which is recounted {{in the first}} section of his Childhood Memories, Ion Creangă was sent to primary school, an {{institution}} then in the care of Orthodox Church authorities, where he became noted for his rebellious attitude and appetite for truancy. Among his colleagues was a female student, Smărăndița popii (known later as Smaranda Posea), for whom he developed an affection which lasted into his adult life, over decades in which the two no longer saw each other. He was taught reading and writing in Cyrillic alphabet through peer tutoring techniques, before the overseeing teacher, , was lassoed off the street and conscripted by the Moldavian military at some point before 1848. After another teacher, whom the Memories portray as a drunk, died from cholera in late 1848, David Creangă withdrew his grandson from the local school and took him to a similar establishment in Broșteni, handing him into the care of a middle-aged woman, Irinuca. Ion Creangă spent several months at Irinuca's remote house on the Bistrița River, before the proximity of goats resulted in a <b>scabies</b> infection and his hastened departure for Pipirig, where he cured himself using birch extract, a folk remedy mastered by his maternal grandmother Nastasia.|$|E
25|$|Topical {{ivermectin}} preparations {{have been}} shown to be effective for <b>scabies</b> in adults, though only one such formulation is available in the United States at present, and it is not FDA-approved as a <b>scabies</b> treatment. It has also been useful for sarcoptic mange (the veterinary analog of human <b>scabies).</b>|$|E
25|$|The elderly, disabled, {{and people}} with an {{impaired}} immune system, such as HIV, cancer, or those on immunosuppressive medications, are susceptible to crusted <b>scabies</b> (formerly called Norwegian <b>scabies).</b> On those with weaker immune systems, the host becomes a more fertile breeding ground for the mites, which spread over the host's body, except the face. The mites in crusted <b>scabies</b> are not more virulent than in noncrusted scabies; however, {{they are much more}} numerous (up to two million). People with crusted <b>scabies</b> exhibit scaly rashes, slight itching, and thick crusts of skin that contain the large numbers of <b>scabies</b> mites. Due to being infected thusly, persons with crusted <b>scabies</b> are more contagious to other persons. Such areas make eradication of mites particularly difficult, as the crusts protect the mites from topical miticides/scabicides, necessitating prolonged treatment of these areas.|$|E
25|$|Mass-treatment {{programs}} that use topical permethrin or oral ivermectin {{have been effective}} in reducing the prevalence of <b>scabies</b> {{in a number of}} populations. No vaccine is available for <b>scabies.</b> The simultaneous treatment of all close contacts is recommended, even if they show no symptoms of infection (asymptomatic), to reduce rates of recurrence. Since mites can survive for only two to three days without a host, other objects in the environment pose little risk of transmission except in the case of crusted <b>scabies,</b> thus cleaning is of little importance. Rooms used by those with crusted <b>scabies</b> require thorough cleaning.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{ivermectin}} {{is effective}} in eradicating <b>scabies,</b> often in a single dose. It is the treatment of choice for crusted <b>scabies,</b> and is sometimes prescribed in combination with a topical agent. It has not been tested on infants, and is not recommended for children under six years of age.|$|E
25|$|Rates of <b>scabies</b> were {{negatively}} related to temperature and positively related to humidity.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{typically}} appear two to {{six weeks}} after infestation for individuals never before exposed to <b>scabies.</b> For those having been previously exposed, the symptoms can appear within several days after infestation. However, symptoms may appear after several months or years. Acropustulosis, or blisters and pustules on the palms and soles of the feet, are characteristic symptoms of <b>scabies</b> in infants.|$|E
25|$|<b>Scabies</b> may be {{diagnosed}} clinically in geographical areas {{where it is}} common when diffuse itching presents along with either lesions in two typical spots or itchiness is present in another household member. The classical sign of <b>scabies</b> is the burrow made by a mite within the skin. To detect the burrow, the suspected area is rubbed with ink from a fountain pen or a topical tetracycline solution, which glows under a special light. The skin is then wiped with an alcohol pad. If the person is infected with <b>scabies,</b> the characteristic zigzag or S pattern of the burrow will appear across the skin; however, interpreting this test may be difficult, as the burrows are scarce and may be obscured by scratch marks. A definitive diagnosis is made by finding either the <b>scabies</b> mites or their eggs and fecal pellets. Searches for these signs involve either scraping a suspected area, mounting the sample in potassium hydroxide and examining it under a microscope, or using dermoscopy to examine the skin directly.|$|E
25|$|Healthcare {{workers are}} at risk of {{contracting}} <b>scabies</b> from patients, because they may be in extended contact with them.|$|E
25|$|Other {{conditions}} {{that can result}} in symptoms similar to the common form include contact dermatitis, herpes simplex virus, discoid lupus, and <b>scabies.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Scabies</b> {{is caused}} by {{infection}} with the female mite Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis. The mites burrow into the skin to live and deposit eggs. The symptoms of <b>scabies</b> are due to an allergic reaction to the mites. Often, only between 10 and 15 mites are involved in an infection. <b>Scabies</b> is most often spread during a relatively long period of direct skin contact with an infected person (at least 10 minutes) such as that which may occur during sex. Spread of disease may occur even if the person has not developed symptoms yet. Crowded living conditions, such as those found in child-care facilities, group homes, and prisons, {{increase the risk of}} spread. Areas with a lack of access to water also have higher rates of disease. Crusted <b>scabies</b> is a more severe form of the disease. It typically only occurs in those with a poor immune system and people may have millions of mites, making them much more contagious. In these cases, spread of infection may occur during brief contact or by contaminated objects. The mite is very small and usually not directly visible. Diagnosis is based on the signs and symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{of early}} <b>scabies</b> {{infestation}} mirror other skin diseases, including dermatitis, syphilis, erythema multiforme, various urticaria-related syndromes, allergic reactions, ringworm-related diseases, and other ectoparasites such as lice and fleas.|$|E
25|$|<b>Scabies</b> is endemic in many {{developing}} countries, where {{it tends to be}} particularly problematic in rural and remote areas. In such settings, community-wide control strategies are required to reduce the rate of disease, as treatment of only individuals is ineffective due to the high rate of reinfection. Large-scale mass drug administration strategies may be required where coordinated interventions aim to treat whole communities in one concerted effort. Although such strategies have shown to be able to reduce the burden of <b>scabies</b> in these kinds of communities, debate remains about the best strategy to adopt, including the choice of drug.|$|E
25|$|By November 2006, {{the use of}} lindane {{had been}} banned in 52 {{countries}} and restricted in 33 others. Seventeen countries, including the US and Canada, allowed either limited agricultural or pharmaceutical use. In 2009, an international ban {{on the use of}} lindane in agriculture was implemented under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. A specific exemption allows for it to continue to be used in second-line treatments for the head lice and <b>scabies</b> for five more years. The production of the lindane isomers α- and β-hexachlorocyclohexane was also banned. Although the US has not ratified the Convention, it has similarly banned agricultural uses while still allowing its use a second-line lice and <b>scabies</b> treatment.|$|E
25|$|Lindane, {{also known}} as gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, (γ-HCCH), gammaxene, Gammallin and {{sometimes}} incorrectly called benzene hexachloride (BHC), is an organochlorine chemical variant of hexachlorocyclohexane {{that has been used}} both as an agricultural insecticide and as a pharmaceutical treatment for lice and <b>scabies.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{resources}} {{required to}} implement such large-scale interventions in a cost-effective and sustainable way are significant. Furthermore, since endemic <b>scabies</b> is largely restricted to poor and remote areas, it {{is a public}} health issue that has not attracted much attention from policy makers and international donors.|$|E
25|$|In Europe in {{the late}} 19th through mid-20th centuries, a sulfur-bearing {{ointment}} called by the medical eponym of Wilkinson's ointment was widely used for topical treatment of <b>scabies.</b> The contents and origins of several versions of the ointment were detailed in correspondence published in the British Medical Journal in 1945.|$|E
25|$|Moxidectin {{is being}} {{evaluated}} {{as a treatment}} for <b>scabies.</b> It is established in veterinary medicine to treat a range of parasites, including sarcoptic mange. Its advantage over ivermectin is its longer half life in humans and, thus, potential duration of action. Tea tree oil appears to be effective in a Petri dish.|$|E
25|$|The mite's gut {{contains}} potent {{digestive enzymes}} (notably Peptidase 1) that persist in their feces and are major inducers of allergic reactions such as wheezing. The mite's exoskeleton can {{also contribute to}} allergic reactions. Unlike <b>scabies</b> mites or skin follicle mites, house dust mites do not burrow under the skin and are not parasitic.|$|E
25|$|The {{superficial}} burrows of <b>scabies</b> usually {{occur in}} the area of the finger webs, feet, ventral wrists, elbows, back, buttocks, and external genitals. Except in infants and the immunosuppressed, infection generally does not {{occur in the}} skin of the face or scalp. The burrows are created by excavation of the adult mite in the epidermis.|$|E
25|$|It is {{typically}} due to either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Risk factors include attending day care, crowding, poor nutrition, diabetes mellitus, contact sports, and {{breaks in the}} skin such as from mosquito bites, eczema, <b>scabies,</b> or herpes. With contact it can spread around or between people. Diagnosis {{is typically}} based on the symptoms.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century, Italian {{biologist}} Diacinto Cestoni (1637–1718) {{described the}} mite now called Sarcoptes scabiei, variety hominis, {{as the cause}} of <b>scabies.</b> Sarcoptes is a genus of skin parasites and part of the larger family of mites collectively known as scab mites. These organisms have eight legs as adults, and are placed in the same phylogenetic class (Arachnida) as spiders and ticks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Scabies</b> {{may occur}} {{in a number of}} {{domestic}} and wild animals; the mites that cause these infestations are of different subspecies from the one typically causing the human form. These subspecies can infest animals that are not their usual hosts, but such infections do not last long. Scabies-infected animals suffer severe itching and secondary skin infections. They often lose weight and become frail.|$|E
25|$|In late Ptolemaic Egypt, Cleopatra used saffron in her baths so that lovemaking {{would be}} more pleasurable. Egyptian healers used saffron as a {{treatment}} for all varieties of gastrointestinal ailments. Saffron was also used as a fabric dye in such Levantine cities as Sidon and Tyre in Lebanon. Aulus Cornelius Celsus prescribes saffron in medicines for wounds, cough, colic, and <b>scabies,</b> and in the mithridatium.|$|E
25|$|The {{reformed}} Damned toured {{regularly for}} about two years and released a new full-length album, Not of This Earth in late 1995. Promoted with a series of long tours prior to its release, by the time the album was released The Damned had yet again split, partly as the result of legal battles: Vanian and Sensible accused <b>Scabies</b> of releasing Not of This Earth without proper authorization.|$|E
25|$|The {{reduction}} in normally accepted facilities, heating, warm food, warm dry clothing, soap {{as well as}} a poor diet resulted in an increase in minor ailments such as dysentery, head lice and <b>scabies,</b> and in major ailments such as typhus, brought to the islands by Russian OT workers. This resulted in a number of deaths. Typhoid and infectious hepatitis appeared more frequently as the war progressed and clean water became scarce.|$|E
25|$|The {{conditions}} affecting {{homeless people}} are somewhat specialized and have {{opened a new}} area of medicine tailored to this population. Skin conditions, including <b>scabies,</b> are common because homeless people are exposed to extreme cold {{in the winter and}} they have little access to bathing facilities. They have problems caring for their feet and have more severe dental problems than the general population. Diabetes, especially untreated, is widespread in the homeless population. Specialized medical textbooks have been written to address this for providers.|$|E
25|$|That August, Lu Edmonds {{was added}} {{as a second}} guitarist. This {{expanded}} line-up unsuccessfully tried to recruit the reclusive Syd Barrett to produce their second album. Unable to get Barrett, they settled for his former Pink Floyd bandmate, Nick Mason. In December, this album was released as Music For Pleasure, and was quickly dismissed by critics. Its failure led to the band being dropped from Stiff Records. <b>Scabies</b> was also displeased with the album, and quit the band after the recording. He was replaced by future Culture Club drummer Jon Moss, who played with The Damned until they decided to break up in February 1978.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} some time being tutored by teacher Iordache, whom the text depicts as a drunk, a sudden outbreak of cholera kills his teacher and pushes Smaranda and Ștefan to send their child out of the village. Nică follows the path of transhumance and is assigned {{to the care of}} shepherds, but he himself falls ill with what the narrator claims was cholera, and, upon returning home with a high fever, is instantly cured with a folk remedy of vinegar and lovage. A while after, claiming insolvency, Ștefan withdraws his son from school. Owing to Smaranda's persistence, the child follows his maternal grandfather David Creangă to Broșteni, where he and his cousin Dumitru are enlisted in a more affordable establishment. This requires adaptation on the part of Nică and Dumitru, both of whom weep once their long hair is shaved off on the new teacher's orders. They are both hosted by a middle-aged woman, Irinuca, in a small house on the Bistrița, where their proximity to goats results in a <b>scabies</b> infection. Creangă then recounts how, while attempting to cure themselves with frequent baths in the river, he and his cousin dislodged a cliff which rolled down and tore through Irinuca's household. After leaving Broșteni in a hurry and spending a while in Borca, the two children hasten for David Creangă's home in Pipirig. After an eventful trip through the Eastern Carpathians, the two boys arrive in the village, where they are welcomed by David's wife Nastasia. She cures their <b>scabies</b> using another local remedy, birch extract.|$|E
