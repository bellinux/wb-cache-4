Diffuse pollution from agricultural sources is considered to be the primary cause of slight-to-moderate water pollution in Ireland, but agricultural point sources, such as farmyards, are often not considered due to their scattered spatial distribution and small areal extent. Agricultural point sources tend to be small and localised hot spots of nutrients and, therefore, can be efficiently treated using environmental technologies developed for wastewater and contaminated land treatment.

40|$|Dairy {{farming in}} Ireland generates an {{effluent}} known as dairy <b>soiled</b> <b>water</b> (DSW), {{which consists of}} a relatively dilute mixture of cow faeces, urine, spilt milk and detergents that is typically applied to grassland. However, relatively {{little is known about}} the volumes generated, nutrient content and management factors that influence volume and concentration. Sixty dairy farms that had a separate storage tank for storing DSW were selected for this study. The spatial distribution of the farms reflected the spatial distribution of dairy cows across the 26 counties of the Republic of Ireland, with each farm representing between 10, 000 and 20, 000 dairy cows. Samples were analysed for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), ammonium N (NH 4 -N), total nitrogen (TN), potassium (K), phosphorus (molybdate-reactive and total) (MRP and TP) and dry matter (DM) content. Management characteristics and parlour properties were quantified. Factors influencing volume and concentration of DSW were determined using mixed model multiple regression analysis. On average, 9784 l (standard error 209 l) of DSW, including rainfall, was produced cow− 1 year− 1 and this contained significant quantities of total N, P and K (587, 80 and 568 mg l− 1, respectively). A typical Irish dairy farm stocked at 1. 9 cows ha− 1 could therefore supply approximately 13, 2 and 12 kg ha− 1 of total N, P and K, respectively, across the farm, annually to meet some of the nutrient requirements for herbage production and potentially replace some of the synthetic fertilizer use. Seventy one percent of samples were within the regulated concentration limits of <b>soiled</b> <b>water</b> for BOD (< 2500 mg l− 1), rising to 87 % during the closed period for slurry spreading (mid October to mid-late January), while 81 % were within the concentration limits for DM (< 1 % DM), rising to 94 % during the closed period. The efficiency of a milking parlour (cows per unit, time taken) plays a key role in determining the volume of DSW generated. This, in turn, also influences the concentration of nutrients and other chemicals. Large variability was found in nutrient concentrations and this presents a challenge for effective nutrient management to maximise the fertilizer replacement value of DSW. peer-reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Dairy <b>soiled</b> <b>water</b> (DSW) is {{produced}} on dairy farms through the washing-down of milking parlours and holding areas, and is generally applied to land. However, {{there is a}} risk of nutrient loss to surface and ground waters from land application.

This novel treatment method would allow the re-use of the final effluent from the woodchip filters to wash down yards, thereby reducing water usage and environmental risks associated with land spreading. Three replicate 100 m(2) farm-scale woodchip filters, each 1 m deep, were constructed and operated to treat DSW from 300 cows over an 11 -month study duration. The filters were loaded at a hydraulic loading rate of 30 L m(- 2) d(- 1), applied in four doses through a network of pipes on the filter surface. Average influent concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD), SS and total nitrogen (TN) of 5750 +/- 1441 mg L- 1, 602 +/- 303 mg L- 1 and 357 +/- 100 mg L- 1, respectively, were reduced by 66, 86 and 57 % in the filters. Effluent nutrient concentrations remained relatively stable over the study period, indicating the effectiveness of the filter despite increasing and/or fluctuating influent concentrations.

The objective {{of this study is}} to relate changes in detailed agronomic N-loading, local weather conditions, hydrogeological and geological site characteristics with groundwater N occurrence over an 11 -year period on an intensive dairy farm with free draining soils and a vulnerable limestone aquifer. In addition, the concept of vertical time lag from source to receptor is considered. Statistical analysis used regression with automatic variable selection. Four scenarios were proposed to describe {{the relationship}}s between paddock and groundwater wells using topographic and hydrogeological assumptions. Monitored nitrate concentrations in the studied limestone aquifer showed a general decrease in the observed time period (2002 – 2011). Statistical results showed that a combination of improved agronomic practices and site specific characteristics such as thicknesses of the soil and unsaturated zone together with hydrogeological connections of wells and local weather conditions such as rainfall, sunshine and soil moisture deficit were important explanatory variables for nitrate concentrations. Statistical results suggested that the following agronomic changes improved groundwater quality over the 11 -year period: reductions in inorganic fertiliser usage, improvements in timing of slurry application, the movement of a dairy <b>soiled</b> <b>water</b> irrigator to less karstified areas of the farm and the usage of minimum cultivation reseeding on the farm. In many cases the explanatory variables of farm management practices tended to become more important after a 1 - or 2 -year time lag.

Application of pig slurry resulted in the highest total nitrogen (TN) and nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 -N) fluxes (22 and 12 kg ha 1), whereas corresponding fluxes from dairy slurries and DSWwere not significantly (p < 0. 05) higher than those from the control soil. There were no significant (p < 0. 05) differences in leachate N losses between unamended and amended dairy slurries, unamended and amended pig slurries, and unamended and amended DSW. There were no leachate P losses measured over the experimental duration. Total cumulative organic (TOC) and inorganic C (TIC) losses in leachate were highest for unamended dairy slurry (82 and 142 kg ha 1), and these were significantly (p < 0. 05) reduced when amended with PAC (38 and 104 kg ha 1). The highest average cumulative CO 2 emissions for all treatments were measured for pig slurries (680 kg CO 2 -C ha 1) followed by DSW (515 kg CO 2 -C ha 1) and dairy slurries (486 kg CO 2 -C ha 1). The results indicate that pig slurry, either in raw or chemically amended form, poses the greatest environmental threat of leaching losses and gaseous emissions of CO 2 and CH 4 and, in general, amendment of wastewater with PAC, alum or zeolite, does not mitigate the risk of these losses...|$|E

The use of aerobic filters {{is an effective}} alternative method of treatment and potentially allows the final effluent to be reused on the farm. Knowledge gaps exist concerning the optimal design and operation of filters {{for the treatment of}} DSW. To address this, 18 laboratory-scale filters, with depths of either 0. 6 m or 1 m, were intermittently loaded with DSW over periods of up to 220 days to evaluate the impacts of depth (0. 6 m versus 1 m), organic loading rates (OLRs) (50 versus 155 g COD m- 2 d- 1), and media type (woodchip versus sand) on organic, nutrient and suspended solids (SS) removals. The study found that media depth was important in contaminant removal in woodchip filters. Reductions of 78 % chemical oxygen demand (COD), 95 % SS, 85 % total nitrogen (TN), 82 % ammonium-nitrogen (NH 4 -N), 50 % total phosphorus (TP), and 54 % dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) were measured in 1 m deep woodchip filters, which was greater than the reductions in 0. 6 m deep woodchip filters. Woodchip filters also performed optimally when loaded at a high OLR (155 g COD m- 2 d- 1), although the removal mechanism was primarily physical (i. e. straining) as opposed to biological. When operated at the same OLR and when of the same depth, the sand filters had better COD removals (96 %) than woodchip (74 %), but {{there was no significant difference}} between them in the removal of SS and NH 4 -N. However, the likelihood of clogging makes sand filters less desirable than woodchip filters. Using the optimal designs of both configurations, the filter area required per cow for a woodchip filter is more than four times less than for a sand filter. Therefore, this study found that woodchip filters are more economically and environmentally effective in the treatment of DSW than sand filters, and optimal performance may be achieved using woodchip filters with a depth of at least 1 m, operated at an OLR of 155 g COD m- 2 d- 1.

40|$|Summary. Long-term {{investigations}} of soil moisture at different precipitation {{patterns in the}} black soil in Hailun county, Northeast China were made. This area is an important base for marketable grains production due to a short cultivation history, high soil organic matter content, and high yield potential. In this region, precipitation is the principal water source during the cropping season, hence <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> storage {{is very important for}} agricultural production. Estimation of the <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> retention characteristics of the black soil is necessary to assess the risk of drought, <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> potential to meet crop water requirements, and irrigation scheduling. The <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> conditions are influenced by meteorology, soil physical properties, vegetation and other related factors. Ten years of field research were the basis for our definition of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> characteristics of the black soils at Hailun Agri-ecology Experimental Station, Songnen plain, Northeast China. This paper identifies three different kinds of precipitation which affect <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> movement and <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> characteristics in different seasons.

40|$|The milking process {{produces}} dairy <b>soiled</b> <b>water</b> (DSW) {{that contains}} variable concentrations of nutrients. The most common method of disposal is by application to land. However, this practice {{can result in}} the pollution of nearby receiving water bodies. It is proposed that aerobic woodchip filters would decrease contaminant concentrations of nutrients in DSW. A laboratory-based experiment investigated woodchip as a filter medium to treat DSW. Subsequently, farm-scale filters investigated the system under normal farm conditions. The effectiveness of two types of sand filters (SFs), single-layer and stratified, were compared to treat effluent from the farm-scale woodchip filters. 0. 5, 1, and 1. 5 m-deep laboratory filters (n= 3) containing Sitka Spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) treated DSW at two loading rates: 280 g suspended solids (SS) m- 2 d- 1 (S 1) and 840 g SS m- 2 d- 1 (S 2). Average chemical oxygen demand (COD), SS and total nitrogen (TN) decreases of 95, 99 and 88 %, respectively, were achieved {{and the effect of}} depth was negligible. Based on these findings, three replicated farm-scale 1 m-deep filters, each with a surface area of 100 m 2, were constructed and loaded at 30 L m- 2 d- 1 for 11 months. Average decreases of 65, 84 and 60 % for COD, SS and TN, respectively, were achieved. Three replicated single-layer SFs and stratified SFs were operated for 82 days and loaded at 20 L m- 2 d- 1 with the effluent from the farm-scale filters. Average influent COD, SS and TN concentrations were decreased by an average of 39, 52 and 36 % for the single-layer SFs and 56, 62 and 57 % for the stratified SFs, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential use of woodchip as a filter medium for treating DSW to produce an effluent for re-use in washing yards, or for application to land as an organic fertiliser. This would reduce water usage and the environmental risks associated with land spreading. Woodchip filters are a low cost, minimal maintenance treatment system, using a renewable resource, which can be easily integrated into existing farm infrastructure...|$|E

40|$|Agricultural {{activity}} {{is a major}} source of nutrient emissions to surface and ground waters and a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Despite legislation to improve terrestrial water quality, prescribed targets are not being met. This is against a background of more intensive farming practices such as concentrated animal feeding operations, which have led to large volumes of manures being generated in relatively small areas and spread at rates that exceed plant nutrient demand. The competing demands of providing more food from the same land area, while simultaneously reducing environmental impacts, is a major challenge. While many mitigation measures to reduce nutrient losses, such as crop and land management, have been put forward, these alone will not achieve the necessary improvements in water and air quality. The main nutrients of concern are phosphorus (P), which mainly contributes to coastal and freshwater eutrophication, and nitrogen (N), which has adverse impacts on human and livestock health through leaching to groundwater. Increased losses of carbon (C) also adversely impact the atmosphere through greenhouse gas emissions. New techniques which are sustainable, economical, and which do not negatively impact the atmosphere, aquatic ecosystems or human and animal health, are therefore required to reduce this form of non-point agricultural pollution. Similarly, a greater understanding of the removal mechanisms and factors affecting the performance of existing treatment technologies, such as aerobically operated farm filters, is needed. This laboratory-based study examined the effectiveness of applying combined zeolite and either polyaluminum chloride (PAC) or alum amendments to reduce losses of N, P, C and suspended solids (SS) from surface applied dairy and pig slurries, and dairy <b>soiled</b> <b>water</b> (DSW), when subjected to varying interval rainfall events. Traditionally, such studies aimed to reduce only P in the surface runoff; however, this study aimed to identify an optimal amendment to the slurries and DSW to simultaneously reduce N, P, C and SS. Once an optimal rate of amendment was determined, their impact â if any â on leaching losses of N, P and C, and on emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4), were quantified. Separately, a passive filter study using woodchip and sand media to investigate the impacts of media depth, organic loading rates (OLRs), and media type to treat DSW, was also undertaken. The study concluded that combined use of zeolite and chemical amendments when mixed with dairy and pig slurries and DSW, reduced losses of N, P and SS in surface runoff to a much greater extent than those from unamended slurries. The combined amendments were most effective when mixed with dairy slurry, followed by pig slurry, and were least effective when used with DSW. The impact of the amendments was correlated with the dry matter (DM) content of the slurries and the relative effectiveness of the amendments to flocculate P, N and SS-enriched slurry particles. Although the amendments were also effective in reducing C losses, their use may not be economically viable, given the relatively low amounts of C measured in runoff from unamended slurries compared with the amounts applied. Use of the combined amendments did not reduce leaching losses of N, P and C, or gaseous emissions of CO 2 and CH 4 from pig slurries and DSW, when compared to unamended slurries. While they reduced leaching losses of C from dairy slurries, they also increased CO 2 emissions. The greatest short term threat of nutrient leaching and gaseous emissions of CO 2 and CH 4 was posed by pig slurry, in both amended and unamended forms. Intermittently loaded woodchip filters were assessed to be more economically and environmentally effective in treating DSW than sand filters; however, their removal mechanism for all contaminants was physical as opposed to biological. While the sand filters nitrified DSW effluent [43 Â± 18 mg nitrate-N (NO 3 -N) L- 1] for the first 85 days of operation, concentrations reduced thereafter to 7. 2 Â± 1. 6 mg NO 3 -N L- 1. The woodchip filters did not nitrify the effluent, even at relatively low loadings of 35 g chemical oxygen demand (COD) m- 2 d- 1. The final filtered effluent from both sand and woodchip filters, however, was above the concentrations at which it may be legally discharged to receiving waters. Options for its reuse may be to use the treated effluent in irrigation and, in time, to incorporate the spent timber residue into the soil. The potential of mixing zeolite and chemical amendments with agricultural slurries to mitigate environmental impacts must be considered in the context of traditional conservation and nutrient management practices, which would appear to be the most cost effective strategies over the long term. The N, P, and C mitigation measures described in this study may provide more immediate water quality benefits, at overloaded âlegacyâ sites or âcritical source areasâ, where manure additions are already restricted to crop removal rates. Prior to use of the new techniques described in this study, a cost-benefit analysis of applying amendments to organic wastes, and to on-farm filter treatment of DSW will be essential in the context of whole-farm and watershed-scale nutrient management. Such an analysis should only be carried out after long term field-scale studies, and should also address management and legislative issues related to discharge consents for on-farm treated agricultural wastes and to selected use of manure amendments...|$|E
