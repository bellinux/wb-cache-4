40|$|When an {{observer}} with a holistic viewing attitude perceives transparency in an achromatic two-dimensional pattern, {{some areas of}} the pattern form a single transparent phenomenal surface. In each of these areas the observer simultaneously perceives the gray color of the transparent surface and the gray color of the background that is visible through the transparent surface. With an analytic viewing attitude the observer perceives a single gray color in each area of the pattern. When the viewing attitude changes from analytic to holistic, the term color <b>scission</b> <b>means</b> the phenomenal replacement of the single analytically perceived gray color of an area of the pattern with the two gray colors that are perceived in the same area when such area forms a transparent surface. The concept of color scission has been used by Moore Heider and Metelli to explain phenomenal transparency. An analysis of experimental results reported in the literature shows that color scission does not occur in transparent patterns formed by only three areas and that it involves incorrect predictions of the occurrence of transparency in patterns formed by four or more areas. It is concluded that in general the concept of color scission is inadequate to explain phenomenal transparency...|$|E
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to {{calculate}} the total energy released in binary, neutron accompanied and α-particle accompanied fission of 236 U* and 252 Cf. Using measured values for the average kinetic energy released in fission, estimates are obtained for the average deformation-excitation energy of fission in each mode. The average number of neutrons emitted from the accelerated fragments in each fission mode is also evaluated and leads to estimates for the average energy required to emit a neutron in binary and ternary fission. Best values are found for the differential energetics between binary and ternary fission in 252 Cf and 236 U*. By comparing their electrostatic potential energies {{at the moment of}} <b>scission,</b> the <b>mean</b> extension of positive charge is found to be greater on average in α-particle accompanied fission, than in binary fission. A number of experimentally determined parameters of interest in fission theory are also presented...|$|R
