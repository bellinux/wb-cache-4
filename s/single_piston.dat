5|$|Flamethrower, {{double piston}} and gunpowder-activated: Although the <b>single</b> <b>piston</b> {{flamethrower}} was first {{developed in the}} Byzantine Empire during the 7th century, the 10th-century Chinese flamethrower, or Pen Huo Qi, boasted a continuous stream of flame by employing double piston syringes (which had been known since the Han Dynasty) spouting Greek fire which had been imported from China's maritime trade contacts in the Middle East. It was first used in battle 932 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907–960), and the earliest illustration {{is found in the}} early Song Dynasty military manuscript Wujing Zongyao of 1044, which also described the device in full. Unlike the Greek model which employed a furnace, the Pen Huo Qi was ignited by an incendiary gunpowder fuse.|$|E

The Zenith, which gained the designation Zenith CH 200 when Heintz produced plans for larger and smaller derivatives, is a low-winged cantilever monoplane of all metal construction. The pilot and passenger sit side-by-side under a clear, sideways opening plexiglas canopy, while the aircraft is fitted with a fixed nosewheel undercarriage.

25|$|In 1889 Samuel M. Vauclain of the Baldwin Locomotive Works {{devised the}} Vauclain {{compound}} locomotive. This design used a double-expansion engine fitted {{into the space}} occupied by a conventional single-expansion engine on the locomotive, using a <b>single</b> <b>piston</b> valve with conventional gear to control both the high- and low-pressure cylinders. The high-pressure cylinder could be placed above or below the low-pressure cylinder, each had its own piston rod connected to a common crosshead, so that one connecting rod and crank was required for each pair of cylinders. Substantial fuel efficiencies were achieved, but maintenance difficulties doomed the type. Most were converted to conventional engines.|$|E
25|$|The Skeeter {{possessed a}} {{relatively}} conventional configuration for a helicopter, being {{powered by a}} <b>single</b> <b>piston</b> engine which drove a 29-foot (8.84metre) three-bladed main rotor and a three-bladed anti-torque rotor, which was mounted {{at the end of}} a triangular-section tailboom. The main rotor-blades made used of a composite construction, utilising a steel-tube spar that was bonded to wooden veneers, formers, and ribs, as well as brass balance-weights; these reportedly delivered a cost-effective and relatively simplistic rotor blade that also possessed favourable fatigue properties. Saunders-Roe also developed a replacement metal light alloy rotor blade that possessed superior aerodynamic properties and provided increased performance. A fixed tricycle undercarriage arrangement, complete with interchangeable wheels and brake units, was also present.|$|E
25|$|The SR.N1 was {{powered by}} a <b>single</b> <b>piston</b> engine, driven by {{expelled}} air. Demonstrated at the Farnborough Airshow in 1960, it was shown that this simple craft could carry a load of up to 12 marines with their equipment {{as well as the}} pilot and co-pilot with only a slight reduction in hover height proportional to the load carried. The SR.N1 did not have any skirt, using instead the peripheral air principle that Christopher had patented. It was later found that the craft's hover height was improved by the addition of a skirt of flexible fabric or rubber around the hovering surface to contain the air. The skirt was an independent invention made by a Royal Navy officer, C.H. Latimer-Needham, who sold his idea to Westland (by then the parent of Saunders-Roe's helicopter and hovercraft interests), and who worked with Christopher to develop the idea further.|$|E

25|$|In 1900 the Italian {{engineer}} Enrico Plancher {{developed a}} new and curious design of compound engine, which first appeared on the Rete Adriatica 500 class express locomotive; it was notable for being an asymmetrical four-cylinder design, {{in which the two}} AP and the two LP cylinders were grouped together, with each couple being served by a <b>single</b> <b>piston</b> valve which admitted steam simultaneously to the opposite ends of the two cylinders. The prototype of the class was presented at the International Railway Congress of 1900 in Paris and was looked at with interest, while not meeting with outstanding success; however, on the long run the asymmetrical design, while simple, proved to be rather awkward, as it was difficult to equalize the work of each side of the locomotive and this caused hunting. The Plancher engine was used again on some Ferrovie dello Stato designs like the FS Class 680 express locomotives and the FS Class 470 heavy freight locomotives, but no further application was approved after the widespread adoption of the superheater.|$|E

50|$|The Vauclain {{compound}} was {{a type of}} compound {{steam locomotive}} that was briefly popular around 1900.

2500|$|Each engine had a <b>single</b> <b>piston</b> which {{measured}} {{12 inches}} {{on the inside}} bore, and drove a piston rod with a stroke of 48 inches.

2500|$|A {{floating}} caliper (also called a [...] "sliding caliper") moves {{with respect to}} the disc, along a line parallel to the axis of rotation of the disc; a piston {{on one side of the}} disc pushes the inner brake pad until it makes contact with the braking surface, then pulls the caliper body with the outer brake pad so pressure is applied to both sides of the disc. Floating caliper (<b>single</b> <b>piston)</b> designs are subject to sticking failure, caused by dirt or corrosion entering at least one mounting mechanism and stopping its normal movement. This can lead to the caliper's pads rubbing on the disc when the brake is not engaged or engaging it at an angle. Sticking can result from infrequent vehicle use, failure of a seal or rubber protection boot allowing debris entry, dry-out of the grease in the mounting mechanism and subsequent moisture incursion leading to corrosion, or some combination of these factors. Consequences may include reduced fuel efficiency, extreme heating of the disc or excessive wear on the affected pad. A sticking front caliper may also cause steering vibration.|$|E
