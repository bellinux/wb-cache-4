5|$|The {{concept of}} motive is also explored. When confronting Padgett, Mulder asks {{him why he}} is murdering his victims. Padgett, in turn, admits that he cannot answer the question. Kaner {{suggests}} that Padgett is representative of a version of Mulder, {{and that there is}} a direct parallel between being a criminal profiler—who must think like the criminal—and a writer—who must think like his characters. In the end, however, Padgett sacrifices his personal quest—his manuscript—in order to be free. This presents a distinct contrast to Mulder, who will never truly give up his obsession. Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X, also notes that the episode sheds light on Scully's motive throughout the series: she wants to gain Mulder's attention, something she feels <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have.</b> Padgett eventually realizes this, and sacrifices himself for her love.|$|E

Although Ted does not believe him, he still tries to grow a mustache, which Stella laughs at (a year earlier, Barney had made a ten-dollar bet with Ted {{that he could get}} him to grow a mustache). Upset, Ted says he gives up, but Lily (Alyson Hannigan) tells him to try again, as Stella is interested in him, though she says she has not been to see her. It is then revealed that Marshall (Jason Segel) had gone to see Stella to talk up Ted, and found out Stella had a crush on him. The book ended up belonging to Marshall. Happy that Stella is interested in him, Ted asks her out after his last session, but she says <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> time for dating because she has a daughter.|$|E

When Liz calls the dentist's office to say <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> anyone to pick her up, the receptionist (Shinnerrie Jackson) informs her that after her procedure she can only leave alone if she signs a liability waiver.

After {{returning}} to the town, they discover that several {{years have passed since}} they left, as time speeds up away from the spiral. The other citizens have expanded the terraced houses until they connect into a single structure forming a spiral pattern. Kirie and Shuichi decide to search for Kirie's parents, which brings them {{to the center of the}} spiral. At the center, they fall down a pit, within which they discover the corpses of Kirie's parents and an ancient city completely covered with spiral patterns. Shuichi urges Kirie to move forward and find a way to stop the curse, but she replies that <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the strength and wishes to stay with him. The two embrace each other, and their bodies twist and wrap together as a result of the curse. As they lie together, Kirie notes that the curse ended at the same time it began, for just as time speeds up away from the center, it freezes at the center, and concludes that the curse is eternal, and all the events will repeat when a new Kurōzu-cho is built where the previous one laid.|$|E

The people fear that the god, which they call Grandfather, will awaken and consume the entire universe if the song is ever interrupted. Merry begins singing, joined by a chorister at the pyramid. During the song, a mummy in a glass case at the pyramid begins to awaken. Merry panics, believing she got the song wrong. A beam of light from the pyramid envelops her, and she is pulled toward the pyramid and the mummy. The Doctor and Clara find Dor'een and rent the space bike using Clara's mother's ring as payment. They ride the bike to the pyramid where they find the mummy struggling to escape the case and consume Merry's soul. The Doctor promises Merry that <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to sacrifice herself and that he will stop Grandfather. As they attempt to leave, a group of creatures called the Vigil arrive and attempt to force Merry to sacrifice herself.

A ray of light strikes the planet, revealing that Grandfather is Akhaten itself, a planet-sized parasitic creature.|$|E
5|$|The {{major theme}} of Buffy's dream is {{her fear of}} the {{personal}} cost of {{her life as a}} Slayer, the isolation and loneliness she is forced to endure. This theme of aloneness is reiterated by several shots in which she is alone in the frame, most notably the wide shot of her in the vast and empty desert. Another source of anxiety is her relationship with her current boyfriend, Riley, whom she finds plotting world domination with Adam in his original, human, form. She fears what Riley could turn into {{as a result of his}} alliance with the military. She also fears the destabilizing effect of this alliance on their relationship, and the destabilizing effect of this relationship on her life as the slayer. She is shown putting mud on her face, mimicking the mud mask of the primal, First Slayer. By the end of her encounter in the desert with the First Slayer, Buffy realizes that <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to be entirely alone, that it is her closeness to friends and family that makes her a great Slayer, and once she experiences this revelation, the efforts of the First Slayer to continue to engage her in battle become fruitless and increasingly comical. The dream finally ends in a mundane way, as Buffy refuses to accept a tragic climax and instead insists on normality in her life.|$|E

After an accident caused by Lilith, Rosie is hospitalized and Mark and Callie {{take on the task}} to raise Lilith. In just a few weeks, she is eighteen years old and has started dating Randall. Mark takes in Twayne for a session and finds out about his arranged marriage to Lilith, and that the marriage will be a televised sex ritual.

Lilith, however, wants to the opposite of what Callie wants and tells her that she will marry him. Just before the ritual is about to commence, Lilith reveals to Mark that she plots to kill Callie and Twayne and instead join Mark at the sex altar.
