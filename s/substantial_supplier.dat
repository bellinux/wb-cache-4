The oil and gas market of Brazil {{is one of the}} fastest growing markets in the world and they are expanding beyond the capacity of their domestic oil and gas related industry, thus representing an opportunity for foreign entrants. Problem Cultural friction between two parties of different cultural background is a driver for increased levels of conflict. In a foreign entry, such friction may represent an obstacle to development and growth. Purpose This thesis aims to develop a framework on how a Norwegian company within the oil service industry can achieve its goals in Brazil. Developing such a framework, I utilized already existing theories in a new context. Research The research process was carried out in a qualitative manner. The data collection came from four in-depth interviews where the respondents represented two different areas of the oil service industry. The key topics for the interviews were; challenges in Brazil, success factors in Brazil, success factors for Norwegian firms in Brazil and cultural friction. Findings Cultural friction was determined as a severe challenge for Norwegian companies entering the Brazilian market. Further it was connected to uncertainty avoidance, power distance, individualism and long-term orientation. Norwegian companies are, in addition challenged by the local contents in labour and less loyalty. Success factors in Brazil are knowledge about how to handle time, management and local presence. Conclusion The research showed that Norwegian companies within the oil service industry that had advanced into Brazil face several challenges.

40|$|Working with {{international}} suppliers in global supply chains, manufacturing firms now {{are faced with}} <b>substantial</b> <b>supplier</b> risks which could be triggered by disruptions in either their suppliers or the supplier’s market. Reactive actions to the risks, however, have usually {{been shown to be}} inefficient and sometimes ineffective. In this dissertation, therefore, I develop a theoretical framework linking some key relationship-specific capabilities to supplier risk. My contention is that the capabilities, when developed, can help proactively mitigate the risk. Thus, the model in this study is grounded in the resource-based and the relational views. In this study, the survey method has been employed to collect data from 66 manufacturing firms in the United State who are sourcing from international suppliers. Procedural and statistical methods have been employed to guard against typical empirical issues including non-response bias, common method bias, and problems in validity and reliability of measurement instruments. Structural equation modeling with partial least squares was employed to test the model with bootstrapping to estimate t-values for the paths. The analysis results showed support for the model. A conclusion from the study is that visibility is the critical relationship-specific capability that needs to develop for buying firms to mitigate supplier risk proactively. This is because it may not be substitutable by other mechanisms like goodwill trust, and other capabilities, including absorptive capacity and IT integration, will only operate via visibility to influence risk performance. Moreover, visibility is a significant capability that helps mitigate risk regardless of the relationship duration between the buyer and the supplier and of the market conditions under which the supplier is working. This study thus adds to the risk literature with discussions of supplier risks. Nuances have also been added to the resource-based and relational views by developing the theoretical relationships among the identified capabilities and by examining the contextual conditions under which the relationships are working to mitigate supplier risk. Managers from both sides of a dyadic relationship may benefit from the study by utilizing the tools and the study results to monitor and mitigate supplier risk...|$|E

50|$|Initially, {{the area}} was sparsely populated, but after the second siege of Vienna (1683), it was more densely settled, {{primarily}} along Alser Straße. At {{the end of the}} 17th century, the population of Slovenes, Croats and Slovaks previously residing in Spittelberg were forcibly moved to the so-called Krowotendörfl (literally: 'village of Croats') north of Alser Straße. In 1753, the Alser Kaserne barracks were erected (demolished in 1912). Traditionally, many poorhouses and hospitals were located in Alservorstadt, and their high mortality rate required many cemeteries, such as the Neuer Schottenfriedhof cemetery (documented up to 1784). 1784 also saw the inauguration of the Vienna General Hospital, a then public hospital regarded as modern with respect to contemporary standards. The same period also saw the establishment of the Findelhaus, a bearing house, and the k.k. Gewehrfabrik which became a <b>substantial</b> rifle <b>supplier</b> for the Austrian Army.From 1821 to 1862, the municipality of Alservorstadt maintained a town hall in a two-storey, baroque building located at 8., Laudongasse 5.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{discusses}} {{prospects for}} increased consumption {{of natural gas}} within the European Union (EU) up to 2030. Particular {{emphasis is on the}} power generation sector, where the main growth in demand is expected to occur, on supply and infrastructural constraints and on future price of natural gas. It can be concluded that EU gas-import needs will increase substantially up to 2010, driven by a combination of rapid increase in demand in southern Europe and declining production in northern Europe. As a result there will be an increased import dependency which will affect security of supply, not only in the gas sector but also in the electricity sector. Gas demand after 2010 will partially depend on the level of continued CO 2 emission restrictions, a possible nuclear phase-out in the UK, Germany and Belgium and to what extent the option to store CO 2 in subsurface reservoirs will be applied. However, supplies of gas are plentiful, at least in the medium-term up to 2010 / 2015, and a number of new countries will emerge as <b>substantial</b> <b>suppliers</b> to the European gas market, increasing competition and possibly leading to a situation of oversupply between 2008 and 2012 which in turn may create a downward pressure on gas prices. In addition, the US market may, pending on demand and indigenous production, experience considerable oversupply between around 2008 and 2015, reducing the possibilities of conducting arbitrage between the two main markets in the Atlantic basin and further contributing to a downward pressure on the gas price. On the other hand, the oil price {{will continue to be a}} major determinant of the gas price and a tight oil supply/demand balance will create an upward pressure on the gas price. Global liquefaction and regasification capacity is expected to more than double between now and 2010 leading to a more flexible and global gas trading and increasing spot sales and although the cost of LNG has decreased substantially over the past three decades it is still more costly than piped gas at distances up to 3000 — 4000 km within comparable regions. Thus, an increased use of LNG will contribute to an increase in average gas prices locally. Problems related to gas production capacity together with abundant supply to the EU markets and increased competition points to that Russia will loose market share in the short run, in particular as piped Russian gas is not competitive on the main growth markets, i. e. UK, and Italy/Spain. Nevertheless, in the long run, it can be expected that the EU dependency on gas from Russia as well as on the Middle East will increase. The vulnerability in supply security and the high dependency on Russian gas has been highlighted by the latest events (January 2006) with Russia cutting supplies to Ukraine. A critical factor is the large and timely investments required along the entire fuel chain in order to meet rapidly increasing demand, often in regions with uncertain investment conditions. Also, the producing countries are likely to invest according to national interest rather than to supply an increasing global demand.

40|$|Background This PhD thesis aims at {{combining}} {{different perspectives}} {{from the literature}} on organizational theory, innovation, and economic geography and addresses how firms 1 communicate and connect within the contexts of innovation processes. The literature concerned with organizational theory has {{had a tendency to}} overlook the significance of external surroundings and rather overemphasize within-firm relations and capabilities 2. On the other hand, the literature on economic geography sometimes fails to consider that firms are heterogeneous leading to studying firms in a static manner. The thesis aims at contributing to the existing body of literature that connects these approaches by looking at how firms organize their innovation activities in relation to their contexts and how firms create external knowledge linkages. This in turn reflects firms’ internal competences, as firms’ internal capabilities guides firms’ ability to find new knowledge, connect to partners and innovate, hence their absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal 1990, 67). At the same time, the external environment influences firms’ internal competence. The underlying mechanism is that people are inseparable from their environments because “environments only exist through the people behaving in them knowing them” (Schneider 1987, 439). One premise is thus that innovation is an interactive process where people with different competence meet in order to solve problems (Østergaard, Timmermans, and Kristinsson 2011, Bathelt, Malmberg, and Maskell 2004, Lundvall 1992). There is a need for increased understanding of how these interactive processes are organized, which actors are involved, and how these activities play out in space, gaining such understanding by both considering firms’ internal and external knowledge and competence. One example is that having diverse human resources could lead to reaching an equally diverse marketplace (Cox 2001) and access to broader knowledge, which in turn is important for innovation (Laursen and Salter 2006). This PhD aims at gaining insight on the interdependencies of firms and external knowledge linkages in innovation, particularly focusing on the role of diversity. The overall research question is: how does diversity and space affect innovation? Research Design: Data and Methods The four individual papers take advantage of different data and methods. Paper I and III draws on large and unique datasets that consist of public enterprise registers gathered on an annual basis covering all employer firms and all workers in private sectors in Norway. These data are often referred to as Linked Employer – Employee Data (LEED). The LEED are then merged with an extended version of the Community Innovation Survey (CIS). Paper II builds on the survey data from approximately 500 firms in Norway with more than ten employees, covering all sectors and regions. Paper IV takes advantage of a panel data set consisting of 1500 firms in the Norwegian upstream oil and gas industry. All of the four individual papers aim at measuring different aspects of innovation at different stages in the innovation process. The simplified definition of innovation is: a “new idea, device or method” or “the act or process of introducing new ideas, devices or methods” (Merriam-Webster 2016). Innovation is both the process of e. g. developing new markets and/or new products, or new methods of production, as well as the outcome: e. g. increase in value added, or a new product. Although innovation is not a chronological process without any setbacks or loops (Kline and Rosenberg 1986), the innovation process goes through stages that are distinct in time, i. e. patenting, product and process innovations, and launching these product in markets and an increase in revenue at the bottom line caused by innovations. In Paper I, innovation is measured in three ways: firstly by the decision to engage in systematic development work, secondly by patent, and thirdly by product and process innovation. Paper II measures innovation by product innovation (and new-to-market product innovation) and process innovation (and new-to-industry process innovation). Paper III measures innovation by looking at whether firms have launched goods and/or services in international markets. Paper IV measures the effects of industrial agglomeration on firms’ value added, where increased innovation is an important underlying factor leading to increased productivity for firms that are geographically co-located. Hence, all of the four individual papers offer a distinct and different outlook on innovation, including product innovation, effects on productivity, and new processes or underlying mechanisms of collaboration and market entry. Various econometric analyses are employed in the different papers, and mostly similar techniques are used. Results All of the four individual papers demonstrate that different aspects of diversity and space affect innovation. The results from paper I demonstrate that exploration (patent output) responds differently to the composition of firms’ human resource bases than exploitation (new products & production processes) does. Moreover, the results demonstrate that exploration is dependent on diversity of human resources, whilst exploitation is more dependent on similar capabilities. Investments in innovation are important moderators of these effects. Paper II and Paper III investigates the role of foreign workers in firms and demonstrates some of the underlying mechanisms between foreign workers, international partners and innovation/export of goods and/or services to international markets. In Paper II, we find evidence that firms with highly educated foreign workers collaborate more frequently with international partners {{and that there is a}} positive relation between having a variety of international partners and the probability of product innovation and new-tomarket product innovation (as well as new-to-industry process innovation). The results from Paper III demonstrate that firms in core, intermediate, and peripheral regions benefit from international collaboration and foreign workers in order to be present on international markets. The results stresses that firms in peripheral regions are not detached from the global economy, but are able to partake in able to tap into global economies by e. g. collaborating with international partners. Paper IV studies a particular industry, namely the upstream oil and gas industry in Norway, and finds that firms in this industry benefit from regional agglomeration through increased productivity as measured by value added. This is particularly so when firms within the same subsector are co-located. Knowledge spillovers leading to increased innovation are believed to be an important underlying factor driving agglomeration related productivity growth. Conclusions The four individual papers all demonstrate different aspects of the interdependencies between firms and their contexts while also highlighting the role of diversity. The papers demonstrate how diversity amongst actors contributes to some types of innovation, whilst other types of innovation are facilitated through similarity between actors. The results from paper I demonstrates how exploration (patent output) is more dependent on diversity in human resources, than exploitation where similarity in experience and educational background seems more important. The results from paper II demonstrates how diversity amongst workers, as measured by foreign workers, may contribute to new collaboration patterns, which in turn prove essential for product and new-to-market product innovation as well as new-to-industry process innovation. The results from paper III demonstrate that firms in core, intermediate, and peripheral regions benefit from collaborating with international partners and hiring foreign workers in order to be present on international markets. The results paint a varied picture of different dimensions of innovation in relation to different measures of diversity, but furthermore in relation to space and context. This provides an important element of not only increasing our understanding of the role of diversity in both core, intermediate, and peripheral regions, but also since past contributions have had a tendency to study globalization and diversity in cities, the results demonstrate the capability of benefitting of diversity across space. The results from paper IV demonstrate that close communication and <b>substantial</b> interaction between <b>suppliers</b> and buyers that permeate the upstream oil and gas industry proves pivotal in increasing value added. This is particularly the case when firms within the same subsector are co-located, further stressing the importance of similarity between actors...|$|R
