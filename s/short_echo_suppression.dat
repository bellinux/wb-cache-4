40|$|Linear {{adaptive}} {{filters are}} often used for Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC) but sometimes fail to perform well in notebook computers and inexpensive telephony devices. Low-quality speakers and poorly-designed enclosures that produce vibrations often generate harmonic distortion, and this nonlinear effect degrades the performance of linear AEC algorithms considerably. In this work, we present a new AEC architecture that consists of a linear, subband adaptive AEC filter followed a nonlinear residual <b>echo</b> <b>suppression</b> (RES) stage specifically designed to address harmonic distortion. In addition to suppressing the residual echo in the primary subband, the proposed model also suppresses the residual echo in a window of bands surrounding the higher order harmonics. Results show considerable improvement over other proposed algorithms, and the new algorithm has much lower implementation costs compared to nonlinear AEC models based on Volterra filters and a previously proposed, nonlinear residual <b>echo</b> <b>suppression</b> algorithm.

40|$|The {{precedence}} effect {{describes the}} phenomenon whereby echoes are spatially fused {{to the location}} of an initial sound by selectively suppressing the directional information of lagging sounds (<b>echo</b> <b>suppression).</b> <b>Echo</b> <b>suppression</b> is a prerequisite for faithful sound localization in natural environments but can break down depending on the behavioral context. To date, the neural mechanisms that suppress echo directional information without suppressing the perception of echoes themselves are not understood. We performed in vivo recordings in Mongolian gerbils of neurons of the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL), a GABAergic brainstem nucleus that targets the auditory midbrain, and show that these DNLL neurons exhibit inhibition that persists tens of milliseconds beyond the stimulus offset, so-called persistent inhibition (PI). Using in vitro recordings, we demonstrate that PI stems from GABAergic projections from the opposite DNLL. Furthermore, these recordings show that PI is attributable to intrinsic features of this GABAergic innervation. Implementation of these physiological findings into a neuronal model of the auditory brainstem demonstrates that, on a circuit level, PI creates an enhancement of responsiveness to lagging sounds in auditory midbrain cells. Moreover, the model revealed that such response enhancement is a sufficient cue for an ideal observer to identify echoes and to exhibit <b>echo</b> <b>suppression,</b> which agrees closely with the percepts of human subjects. ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryLocating {{sounds in}} {{realistic}} scenes is challenging because of distracting echoes and coarse spatial acoustic estimates. Fortunately, listeners can improve performance through several compensatory mechanisms. For instance, their brains perceptually suppress short latency (1 – 10  ms) echoes by constructing {{a representation of}} the acoustic environment in a process called the precedence effect [1]. This remarkable ability depends on the spatial and spectral relationship between the first or precedent sound wave and subsequent echoes [2]. In addition to using acoustics alone, the brain also improves sound localization by incorporating spatially precise visual information. Specifically, vision refines auditory spatial receptive fields [3] and can capture auditory perception such that sound is localized toward a coincident visual stimulus [4]. Although visual cues and the precedence effect are each known to improve performance independently, {{it is not clear whether}} these mechanisms can cooperate or interfere with each other. Here we demonstrate that <b>echo</b> <b>suppression</b> is enhanced when visual information spatially and temporally coincides with the precedent wave. Conversely, <b>echo</b> <b>suppression</b> is inhibited when vision coincides with the echo. These data show that <b>echo</b> <b>suppression</b> is a fundamentally multisensory process in everyday environments, where vision modulates even this largely automatic auditory mechanism to organize a coherent spatial experience...|$|R

A reflection arriving later than 1 ms after the direct sound increases the perceived level and spaciousness (more precisely the perceived width of the sound source). A single reflection arriving within 5 to 30 ms can be up to 10 dB louder than the direct sound without being perceived as a secondary auditory event (echo). This time span varies with the reflection level. If the direct sound is coming from the same direction the listener is facing, the reflection's direction has no significant effect on the results.

40|$|Abstract—In this study, {{we propose}} a novel {{technique}} for acoustic <b>echo</b> <b>suppression</b> (AES) during speech recognition under barge-in conditions. Conventional AES methods based on spectral subtraction apply fixed weights to the estimated echo path transfer function (EPTF) {{at the current}} signal segment and to the EPTF estimated until the previous time interval. However, the effects of echo path changes should be considered for eliminating the undesired echoes. We describe a new approach that adaptively updates weight parameters in response to abrupt changes in the acoustic environment due to background noises or double-talk. Furthermore, we devised a voice activity detector and an initial time-delay estimator for barge-in speech recognition in communication networks. The initial time delay is estimated using log-spectral distance measure, as well as cross-correlation coefficients. The experimental {{results show that the}} developed techniques can be successfully applied in barge-in speech recognition systems.

40|$|Acoustic echoes arise {{whenever}} there is acoustic coupling between a loudspeaker and a microphone. A traditional solution for eliminating the undesired echo signal is an acoustic echo canceler (AEC), which identifies the echo path between a loudspeaker and a microphone {{by means of}} an adaptive filter. The echo signal can be canceled successfully when the modeling filter approaches the true echo path. Another way to mitigate the echo effect is through <b>echo</b> <b>suppression.</b> Unlike an AEC, an acoustic echo suppressor (AES) achieves echo attenuation by means of spectral modification. In this paper, we propose an AES without a need for the computationally complex task of acoustic echo path estimation. Instead of identifying the echo path impulse response, the proposed method estimates only the properties of the echo path which are needed for effective <b>echo</b> <b>suppression.</b> These are a delay parameter and a filter mimicking the coloration effect of the echo path on the loudspeaker signal.

40|$|The {{processing}} of acoustic cues {{is critical for}} all animals {{in a wide range}} of behaviours including orientation, predator-prey interactions and social communication. The auditory system can process these sound information with amazing precision. Echolocating bats have developed an extraordinary ability to deal with acoustic cues. Their echo-imaging system has enabled them to detect, pursue and capture tiny prey like insects, to avoid obstacles and to interact with their environment, often in total darkness. Bats heavily rely on the evaluation of echoes for orientation and hunting. The evaluation of external, echolocation- independent sounds also plays an important role for bats, e. g. while localizing prey via prey-generated noise or for social purposes. The current thesis addresses two different aspects of the very complex echo-acoustic situation these extraordinary animals are confronted with in their daily life. The first approach of this thesis is concerned with the question how bats deal with misleading spatial information of echoes. Acoustic orientation most often takes place in echoic environments. Accurate sound localization in natural, echoic environments is a vital task of the auditory system. Many behavioral studies have shown that for accurate sound localization, the auditory system relies only on the spatial information provided by the first wave front and that spatial information of the (delayed) echoes is suppressed (‘precedence effect’). For a bat, this approach is also useful when localizing external, echolocation-independent sound sources, but it is in conflict with the {{processing of}} the echoes of self-generated sounds in an echolocation context. In a two-alternative, forced choice paradigm, it is investigated whether and to what extend the echolocating bats Megaderma lyra and Phyllostomus discolor spontaneously suppress the spatial information of either a second echo of their sonar emission or echoes of different external, echolocation-independent sounds. In general, M. lyra and P. discolor did not suppress the spatial information of a second echo independent of the delay. Only one M. lyra showed significant <b>echo</b> <b>suppression.</b> However, this suppression could not be confirmed in an exact repetition of the experiment. Furthermore, it is shown that in the bat M. lyra, spatial <b>echo</b> <b>suppression</b> is restricted to an external sound which carries semantic meaning for the bat, in this case, a typal contact call. Abstract sounds like an acoustic impulse, a time-inverted contact call, or only the first syllable of the contact call do not induce spontaneous <b>echo</b> <b>suppression.</b> The current data indicate that while bats may be able to suppress the spatial information of echoes, this is not their default mode of auditory processing. The reason for this exceptional absence of spatial <b>echo</b> <b>suppression</b> may lie in the shorter time constants of cochlear processing in the ultrasonic frequency range and the strong influence of cognitive components associated with the precedence effect. This study emphasises the contribution of high-level semantic auditory processing to <b>echo</b> <b>suppression.</b> The aim of the second approach was to characterize how echolocating Phyllostomus discolor deals with size-induced variations in echoes due to different-sized ensonified objects. Echolocating bats can identify three-dimensional objects exclusively through the analysis of acoustic echoes of their ultrasonic emissions. However, objects of the same structure can differ in size and the auditory system must achieve a size-invariant, normalized object representation for reliable object recognition. This study describes the behavioral classification of echoes of complex virtual objects that vary in object size. In a phantom-target playback experiment, it is shown that the bat P. discolor spontaneously classified most scaled versions of objects according to trained standards. This psychophysical performance is reflected in electrophysiological responses of a population of cortical units received from a cooperated study, which showed an object-size invariant response. The current results indicate that echolocating bats have indeed a concept of auditory object normalization...|$|R
