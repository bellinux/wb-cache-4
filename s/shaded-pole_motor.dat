However, unlike a <b>shaded-pole</b> <b>motor,</b> the grooves are at backward positions, and the positions where the rotor settles after each cycle are well determined, which is not the case for induction motors in general, where slip and load affect the angle that the rotor turns each cycle.|$|E

5000|$|A {{reversible}} <b>shaded-pole</b> <b>motor</b> {{was made}} by Barber-Colman several decades ago. It had a single field coil, and two principal poles, each split halfway to create two pairs of poles. Each of these four [...] "half-poles" [...] carried a coil, and the coils of diagonally opposite half-poles were connected {{to a pair of}} terminals. One terminal of each pair was common, so only three terminals were needed in all.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>shaded-pole</b> <b>motor</b> is the {{original}} type of AC single-phase induction motor. A <b>shaded-pole</b> <b>motor</b> is a small squirrel-cage motor in which the auxiliary winding is composed of a copper ring or bar surrounding a portion of each pole. This auxiliary single-turn winding is called a shading coil. Currents induced in this coil by the magnetic field create a second electrical phase by delaying the phase of magnetic flux change for that pole (a shaded pole) enough to provide a 2-phase rotating magnetic field. The direction of rotation is from the unshaded side to the shaded (ring) side of the pole. [...] Since the phase angle between the shaded and unshaded sections is small, shaded pole motors produce only a small starting torque relative to torque at full speed. Shaded-pole motors of the asymmetrical type shown are only reversible via disassembly and flipping over the stator, though some similar-looking motors have small, switch-shortable auxiliary windings of thin wire instead of thick copper bars and can reverse electrically. Another method of electrical reversing involves four coils (two pairs of identical coils).|$|E

Both shading coils were probably closer to the main coil; they could have both been farther away, without affecting the operating principle, just the direction of rotation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} synchronous clocks {{from the}} 1930s were not self-starting, {{and had to}} be started by spinning a starter knob on the back. [...] An interesting flaw in these spin-start clocks was that the motor could be started in either direction, so if the starter knob was spun in the wrong direction the clock would run backwards, the hands turning counterclockwise. Later manual-start clocks had ratchets or other linkages which prevented backwards starting. The invention of the <b>shaded-pole</b> <b>motor</b> allowed self-starting clocks to be made, but since the clock would restart after a power interruption, the loss of time would not be indicated.|$|E
50|$|Earlier designs used a {{rubberized}} idler-wheel drive system. However, {{wear and}} decomposition of the wheel, {{as well as}} the direct mechanical coupling to a vibrating motor, introduced low-frequency noise ("rumble") and speed variations ("wow and flutter") into the sound. These systems generally used a synchronous motor which ran at a speed synchronized to the frequency of the AC power supply. Portable record players typically used an inexpensive <b>shaded-pole</b> <b>motor.</b> At the end of the motor shaft there was a stepped driving capstan; to obtain different speeds, the rubber idler wheel was moved to contact different steps of this capstan. The idler was pinched against the bottom or inside edge of the platter to drive it.|$|E

The most interesting output FE results are the electromagnetic torque characteristics in dependence of the slip. The effect of the rotor bars skewing on the torque is taken into consideration, too.

40|$|Evaporator {{fan motors}} used in {{commercial}} refrigeration applications are fractional horsepower in size, {{are responsible for}} moving air across the evaporator coil, and typically run at one speed. Historically, <b>shaded-pole</b> <b>motors</b> {{have been the most}} commonly used evaporator fan motors in commercial refrigeration equipment and beverage vending machines. These motors, a type of single-phase AC induction motor, are the simplest and least expensive type of fractional-horsepower motor. They are also the least efficient, with the common 9 â€“ 12 W sizes exhibiting an efficiency of approximately 20 %. Electronically commutated (EC) motors, also known as brushless DC motors, became widely commercialized in the late 1980 s, and their use in commercial refrigeration applications has increased within the last 10 to 15 years because of economic incentives and regulatory requirements. Another motor type, the permanent split capacitor (PSC) motor, offers a mid-point between <b>shaded-pole</b> and EC <b>motor</b> price and efficiency levels. Typically for commercial refrigeration evaporator fan motor applications, EC motors are 66 % efficient and PSC motors are usually about 29 % efficient. Â A new motor technology, a type of permanent magnet synchronous AC motor that can directly use grid-supplied AC current without the need to rectify to DC, has recently been commercialized. This new motor has the potential to significantly reduce the energy consumption of evaporator fans in commercial refrigeration equipment. Previously, synchronous motors have been prohibitively expensive for evaporator fan applications because of the high cost of the electronic control circuit that is required to bring the synchronous motor up to synchronous speed. However, this new motor technology makes use of a novel patent-pending controller that is simpler and lower in cost than previous synchronous motor controllers or EC motor controllers, making the new motor a cost-effective alternative in the commercial refrigeration market. Â In this paper, the results of field demonstrations, consisting of side-by-side measurements of the power consumption of the new <b>motor</b> technology versus <b>shaded-pole,</b> PSC, or EC evaporator fan motors in identical refrigerated display cases, are presented. Measured quantities include fan motor power, current, and power factor, as well as display case discharge and return air temperatures and ambient store temperature. Currently, field demonstrations are being conducted at six supermarkets and commissaries located in Kansas City, MO, San Antonio, TX and San Diego, CA, with the duration of these tests ranging from approximately one month to over six months. Initial results from the field demonstrations indicate that the new synchronous AC motor technology is approximately 20 to 30 % more energy efficient than existing EC motors and nearly 80 % more energy efficient than <b>shaded-pole</b> <b>motors.</b> In addition, the new motor exhibits a power factor of approximately 0. 86, which is on average 40 % greater than that of existing evaporator fan motors. Analyses indicate that retrofitting the installed base of commercial refrigeration evaporator fan motors with the new motors would produce a 68 % evaporator fan site energy savings, or 4. 9 Ã— 109 Â kWh/year for the installed base of commercial refrigeration evaporator fan motors. This would result in an annual cost savings of $ 516 million and reduce the annual CO 2 equivalent emissions by 8. 1 Ã— 109 Â lb...|$|R
5000|$|A common {{single-phase}} motor is the <b>shaded-pole</b> <b>motor</b> {{and is used}} in devices requiring low starting torque, such as electric fans, small pumps, {{or small}} household appliances. In this motor, small single-turn copper [...] "shading coils" [...] create the moving magnetic field. Part of each pole is encircled by a copper coil or strap; the induced current in the strap opposes the change of flux through the coil. This causes a time lag in the flux passing through the shading coil, so that the maximum field intensity moves higher across the pole face on each cycle. This produces a low level rotating magnetic field which {{is large enough to}} turn both the rotor and its attached load. As the rotor picks up speed the torque builds up to its full level as the principal magnetic field is rotating relative to the rotating rotor.|$|E

The Original employed a <b>shaded-pole</b> <b>motor</b> from its inception until 1984, at which point it was changed to a permanent split-capacitor motor. Though the fan's physical appearance remained unchanged, the motor was further downgraded in 2002 when production was shipped to Taiwan; the motor, though still oil-lubricated, was switched to a [...] "skeletal" [...] design, as discussed below. Then in 2015, when the model was revised, the motor got pre-2002 elements back, such as 4" [...] main shaft.

50|$|Haydon used a {{conventional}} electric, <b>shaded-pole</b> <b>motor</b> and simply removed the shading coils {{so it would}} run in either direction. To this he attached a coil spring. Haydon found that after the motor was initially started in one direction by hand, it would wind up the spring and stall; then be started by the spring in the reverse direction until the spring again stalled the motor and started it in the original direction. This action would continue, with each oscillation having a Simple harmonic motion characteristic, providing a time base independent of {{the frequency of the}} alternating current supply.Unfortunately, this unit was much too large and expensive for use in household clocks. Since no motors of suitable size or characteristics were available, Haydon started to work in his home workshop to develop an extremely small Induction motor which might prove to be suitable, both in cost and size, for home electric clocks. Haydon soon found that the problem of Miniaturization was extremely difficult because the torque characteristics of an induction motor decreased rapidly as size was reduced. He also found that no engineering data were available on which to base a sound design. So Haydon studied basic motor theory for a considerable length of time at the John Crerar Library in Chicago where he absorbed the works of Charles Proteus Steinmetz and others.|$|E

5000|$|Because inertia {{makes it}} {{difficult}} to instantly accelerate the rotor from stopped to synchronous speed, these motors normally require some sort of special feature to get started.

In the latter instance, applying AC power creates chaotic (or seemingly chaotic) jumping movement back and forth; such a motor will always start, but lacking the anti-reversal mechanism, the direction it runs is unpredictable.

40|$|AbstractThere {{has always}} been doubt on the {{accuracy}} of 2 D analysis of small electric machines. To investigate the validity of this doubt, in this present work a small uni-coil <b>shaded-pole</b> induction <b>motor</b> is analyzed in 2 D and 3 D {{and the results are}} compared. In order to maintain the paper size as compact, the analysis is limited to the air-gap flux density distribution, variation of the main winding inductance against current and the force acting on the rotor body; which are the important components of the motor performance. It is found that although 3 D analysis consumes several times more computing time and storage space, improvement achieved in performance by use of 3 D analysis is not very significant. % rms difference between the two cases is obtained as 0. 76 % for the main winding inductance and 0. 59 % for the force acting on the rotor body. Also the air-gap flux density distribution obtained from the two types of analysis is found to be very close to each other. Therefore it is concluded that despite more computing time, more storage requirements and more human effort in the case of 3 D analysis, the degree of improvement is not proportionally rewarding, and hence, 2 D analysis is sufficient for the analysis of small machines...|$|R
