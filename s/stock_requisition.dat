40|$|The aims of {{this study}} are twofold: to {{identify}} factors influencing the success of municipal financial performance and to design a model for key selected determinants of municipal financial performance. The study was cross-sectional and quantitative in nature and the questionnaire was an instrument used for data collection, and was distributed to only one municipality in the Kwa-Zulu Natal (KZN) Province. The sample consisted of 82 respondents, selected using a census sampling method. The proposed theoretical framework was designed following a literature review. The factors that fitted to the best were then selected {{as the basis for the}} proposed model. The results indicate a significant relationships of <b>stock</b> <b>requisition</b> (p=. 000), procurement understanding (p=. 007), human transparency (p=. 000), and understanding of information communication technology (ICT) (p=. 000) with municipal financial performance. The study recommends that other researches to test and validate a proposed model could be conducted with large sample sizes...|$|E

They included Jakub Berman and Janina Broniewska. Meanwhile, all press published by Poland was dismantled and banned by the Red Army Directive # 1 of 16 September 1939, and the Polish paper <b>stock</b> forcibly <b>requisitioned.</b>|$|R
50|$|A bill of {{materials}} or product structure (sometimes bill of material, BOM or associated list) {{is a list of}} the raw materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, sub-components, parts and the quantities of each needed to manufacture an end product. A BOM may be used for communication between manufacturing partners, or confined to a single manufacturing plant. A bill {{of materials}} is often tied to a production order whose issuance may generate reservations for components in the {{bill of materials}} that are in <b>stock</b> and <b>requisitions</b> for components that are not in stock.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA model is developed to simulate {{various aspects of}} Naval Supply Center requisition processing. The model {{is based on the}} Q-GERT simulation language. Q-GERT was selected because of the likelihood that existing stock point personnel could be easily trained to model <b>stock</b> point <b>requisition</b> throughput with a language that is coded directly from a visual display of the processes being simulated. This thesis introduces the basic Q-GERT concepts and develops the necessary symbology to model the NSC San Diego NSN requisition throughput procedure. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
50|$|A {{production}} {{order is}} an order issued within {{a company to}} produce a specific quantity of material within a certain timeframe. A production order may be issued pursuant to a sales order, and its issuance triggers a number of events. If components {{in the bill of}} materials are in stock, reservations are generated for those items; if they are not in <b>stock,</b> then <b>requisition</b> orders may be generated. Requisition orders may also be generated for production that occurs externally to the firm. Planned costs for the order are also generated and capacity requirements are generated for the work centers.|$|R

Then around 1988 reclassification of 'second class' as 'standard class' took place.|$|R
5000|$|The {{summer of}} 1793 saw sans-culotte {{disturbances}} reach a peak under a double banner: price-fixing and terror. On {{top of this}} came the news of unprecedented treason: Toulon and its squadron had been {{handed over to the}} enemy. In the name of the wretched poverty of the people, the leaders of the Enragés, with Jacques Roux at their head, called for a planned economy from a Convention which had no liking for the idea. But the revolutionary logic of the mobilization of resources by national dictatorship was infinitely more powerful than economic doctrine. In August, a series of decrees gave the authorities discretionary powers over the production and circulation of grain, as well as ferocious punishments for fraud. [...] "Granaries of plenty" [...] were prepared, to <b>stock</b> corn <b>requisitioned</b> by authorities in each district. On 23 August the decree on the levée en masse turned able-bodied civilians into soldiers.|$|R
5000|$|The American Civil War was {{the first}} war where railroads were a {{significant}} factor in moving troops and supplying forces in the field. The United States Military Railroad organization was established to coordinate this new capability for the Union Army. The USMRR organization benefited from the appointment of experienced railroad men from the private sector. Thomas A. Scott, vice-president of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), served as an Assistant Secretary of War during the period 1861-1862. [...] In January 1862 Scott prepared a report on military transportation that anticipated the creation of the USMRR. Daniel C. McCallum, former general superintendent of the New York and Erie Railroad, was appointed as Military Director and Superintendent of U.S. Railroads. Herman Haupt, former chief engineer of the PRR, was appointed as Chief of Construction and Transportation in the Virginia theater. The departments in the USMRR tended to operate autonomously, although micromanagement from the Secretary of War and overlapping authority between departments did affect their operations. Over time the USMRR would buy, build or capture 419 locomotives and 6,330 cars beyond the rolling <b>stock</b> that was <b>requisitioned</b> from the various Northern railroads. When Col. McCallum was first appointed the USMRR system consisted only of 7 miles of the Washington and Alexandria Railroad; however, by war’s end the USMRR exercised control over a network of more than 2,000 miles of military railroads and captured Southern rail lines.|$|R
