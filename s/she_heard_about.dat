Despite The Bat unusually long run, Ellsler appeared in almost every performance (including the evening after <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> her husband's death); she left the part only briefly, after collapsing onstage during the production's final week. The Bat was her last Broadway role.|$|E
25|$|In January 2009, after {{pleading}} {{not guilty}} at Winchester Crown Court, Nicholson was jailed for 11 years for conspiracy to blackmail during the SHAC campaign. Police obtained evidence {{to secure the}} conviction by bugging a 2007 meeting in a cottage in Moorcote, near Hook, Hampshire, attended by Nicholson and six other SHAC activists, as well as hired cars they had used. The bugging was part of Operation Achilles, a police operation against animal rights activists that led to 32 arrests in May 2007, carried out by 700 officers in England, Amsterdam and Belgium. Nicholson gave herself up to police when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the raids; she was arrested and denied bail.|$|E

Yet it was her mother's {{interests}} in Theosophy, the I AM Activity, and Christian Science that had the most influence on Elizabeth. In Theosophy and the I AM Activity <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the Ascended Masters, Karma, and Reincarnation; in Christian Science she was told that matter was not the only reality and that the spirit part of us made in the image of God was our true nature.

25|$|Bing {{continued}} to teach natural childbirth methods in New York, and in 1951 she was invited by Dr. Alan Guttmacher {{to teach at}} Mount Sinai Hospital, which had just opened its first maternity ward. It was here that <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the psychoprophylactic method of childbirth developed by Dr. Fernand Lamaze. Lamaze's method incorporated breathing techniques {{as well as the}} natural childbirth techniques developed by Read. Mount Sinai Hospital cound not afford to send Bing to France to learn the method from Lamaze, but she met Marjorie Karmel, who had published the book Thank You, Dr. Lamaze, in 1959. Karmel had learned the method directly from Lamaze in Paris, and she in turn taught it to Bing. In 1960, the two went on to found the American Society for Psychoprophylaxis in Obstetrics, now known as Lamaze International.|$|E
25|$|Wagner {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Bensenville, Illinois, and began to play sandlot ball with the boys of her {{neighborhood}} {{when she was a little}} girl. At age 15, she attended Bensenville Community High School, where <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Philip K. Wrigley and his remarkable experiment in creating a women professional baseball league during World War II. Wrigley, who was in charge both of the Wrigley Company and the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball club, decided to found the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League as a promotional sideline to maintain interest in baseball. By then, the military draft was depleting Major League rosters of first-line players and attendance declined at ballparks around the country. The league started its first season in 1943 with the teams Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox, and each team was made up of fifteen girls. Wagner was allocated to the Kenosha Comets, where she played her entire career in the circuit.|$|E
25|$|In 211, Cao Cao {{embarked}} on a campaign to attack a coalition of northwestern warlords led by Ma Chao and Han Sui, leading to the Battle of Tong Pass and the subsequent battles. Cao Cao's wife Lady Bian followed her husband and stayed at Meng Ford (孟津; present-day Mengjin County, Henan), while Cao Pi remained in Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei). Lady Bian fell ill during that time. Lady Zhen became worried when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> it and she cried day and night. She constantly sent messengers to inquire her mother-in-law's condition, but refused to believe them when they reported that Lady Bian was getting better, and she became filled with greater anxiety. Lady Bian later {{wrote a letter to}} her, telling her that she had fully recovered, and only then did Lady Zhen's worries disappear. About a year later, when Lady Bian returned to Ye, Lady Zhen rushed to see her mother-in-law and displayed mixed expressions of sadness and joy. Those who were present were all deeply moved by the scene before them. Lady Bian assured Lady Zhen that her illness was not serious and praised her for her filial piety.|$|E

500|$|As a young girl, Mary Alice LeGrow was not {{interested}} in comics since she grew up in Weisbaden, Germany where comics were not readily available. In her freshman year of high school, she discovered comics and anime. <b>She</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Tokyopop's Rising Stars of Manga competition from a friend at the 2003 Otakon, an anime convention in Baltimore, Maryland; the stort story LeGrow submitted won a runner-up place in the competition and was published in the 2003 Rising Stars of Manga anthology.

Timea Nagy, a former human trafficking victim and the founder of Walk With Me (an organization that supports human trafficking victims in Toronto), said that she [...] "felt a huge amount of relief" [...] when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the proposed NAP-CHT, and said, [...] "It's time for Canada to have a National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking." ...|$|E
500|$|In April and May that year, some European-Americans in Texas {{wrote to}} the editor of the Brazosport Facts {{questioning}} the fuss over her death; some were offended because Selena Day coincided with Easter Sunday. Others said, [...] "Easter is more important than Selena Day", and believed people should let Selena rest in peace and get on with their lives. Mexican-Americans living in Texas also {{wrote to the}} newspaper; some agreed that others were too critical of Selena Day, stating they did not need to celebrate the day and should not have responded to its announcement so rudely. This was also seen by the Corpus Christi Caller Times, which said it had printed several of the negative comments left by people and that many comments were [...] "unprintable". Latino filmmaker Lourdes Portillo said she did not know who Selena was when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the shooting.|$|E

500|$|Relations {{with the}} press further {{deteriorated}} when Lorne's private secretary, Francis de Winton, threw four journalists off the royal train. Although the Lornes {{had no knowledge of}} de Winton's action, it was assumed by the press that they did, and they earned an early reputation for haughtiness. Louise was horrified by the negative press, and when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> reports of [...] "a nation of flunkies" [...] at the viceregal court, taking lessons in [...] "the backward walk," [...] Louise declared that she [...] "wouldn't care if they came in blanket coats!". (A reference to the ubiquitous capote, a coat made of blanket-cloth, both durable and warm. The cultural significance of the blanket coat in genteel society, with reference to several early Governors-General and their wives, can be found in [...] "'Very Picturesque and Very Canadian': The Blanket Coat and Anglo-Canadian Identity in the Second Half of the Nineteenth Century" [...] by Eileen Stack of the McCord Museum of Canadian History.) Eventually the worries of a rigid court at Rideau Hall and the [...] "feeble undercurrent of criticism" [...] turned out to be unfounded as the royal couple proved to be more relaxed than their predecessors.|$|E
500|$|A {{few years}} later, when World War I broke out, Tatiana became a Red Cross nurse {{with her mother}} and Olga. They cared for wounded {{soldiers}} in a private hospital on the grounds of Tsarskoye Selo. According to Vyrubova, [...] "Tatiana was almost as skillful and devoted as her mother, and complained only that on account of her youth she was spared some of the more trying cases." [...] Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, who worked with her at the hospital, described in her journal how she planned to boil silk while Tatiana was otherwise occupied, fearing that Tatiana would be too tired to help her. But Tatiana guessed what Chebotareva was doing. [...] "Why can you breathe carbolic acid and I can't?" [...] she asked Chebotareva and insisted on helping her with the work. In September 1914, she was named patron of a war aid committee known simply as the Tatiana Committee. Tatiana was strongly patriotic and apologized in a 29 October 1914 letter for saying something negative about the Germans in her mother's presence. She explained that she forgot her mother had been born in Germany because she thought of Alexandra as only Russian. The Tsarina responded that she did feel completely Russian and Tatiana had not hurt her feelings with her sharp words, but Alexandra was hurt by the actions of her former countrymen and by the gossip <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> her own German connections.|$|E

That he was quite different from other people she had understood at once, but she thought the difference in his favour. Perhaps her sensitive nature divined and responded to the beauty in his. At least, in her eyes Jasper Dale was never a ridiculous figure.|$|R
