The hot, compressed refrigerant vapor {{is now at}} a temperature and pressure at which it can be condensed and is routed through a condenser. Here it is cooled by air flowing across the <b>condenser</b> <b>coils</b> and <b>condensed</b> into a liquid. Thus, the circulating refrigerant removes heat from the system and the heat is carried away by the air. The removal of this heat can be greatly augmented by pouring water over the <b>condenser</b> <b>coils,</b> making it much cooler when it hits the expansion valve.|$|R

50|$|Air-cooled and evaporatively cooled {{chillers}} {{are intended}} for outdoor installation and operation. Air-cooled machines are directly cooled by ambient air being mechanically circulated directly through the machine's <b>condenser</b> <b>coil</b> to expel heat to the atmosphere. Evaporatively cooled machines are similar, except they implement a mist of water over the <b>condenser</b> <b>coil</b> to aid in condenser cooling, making the machine more efficient than a traditional air-cooled machine. No remote cooling tower is typically required with either {{of these types of}} packaged air-cooled or evaporatively cooled chillers.|$|R
50|$|Because an air {{conditioner}} moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept clean. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean the <b>condenser</b> <b>coil.</b> Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, because the <b>condenser</b> <b>coil</b> is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as {{picked up by the}} evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.|$|R
50|$|In {{the heating}} mode the ground {{serves as the}} evaporator. Liquid {{refrigerant}} coming - through the liquid line- from the heat pump’s indoor coil (serving as the condenser) is expanded and enters the smaller diameter tube of the ground loop. Heat is then transferred from the warmer ground to the ground loop. This leads to the refrigerant boiling to a vapor (evaporation) as it progresses through the loop. The refrigerant vapor then exits the ground loop and is returned -through the vapor line- to the compressor unit. Once in the compressor, the refrigerant is compressed to a higher pressure and temperature. The hot, superheated refrigerant vapor is now delivered to the indoor <b>coil</b> (<b>condenser)</b> where it gives off heat to the cooler building’s final delivery fluid {{with the assistance of}} the indoor circulator. As the refrigerant vapor gives off heat, it gradually condenses back to the liquid state.|$|R
40|$|Heat pump {{water heaters}} can cut {{electricity}} consumption by half, as comparing {{to the conventional}} electric resistant water heaters. A conventional heat pump water heater (HPWH) usually has a water circulating pump to sample water temperature every 15 minutes in the tank, and to draw water to a condenser-water heat exchanger outside the tank, if water temperature is below the set point. The pump would be on at least once every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day. The novel design presented {{in this study was}} to insert the <b>condenser</b> <b>coil</b> through the opening {{on the top of the}} water tank. This design eliminated the need of the water circulating pumps, and may improve the efficiency of the HPWH by eliminating pumping power. Two types of <b>condenser</b> <b>coil</b> designs were considered; one was a bayonet tube (tube-in-tube) and one was the “U ” tube. Previous test data indicated that “U ” tube design performed better than the bayonet tube <b>condenser</b> <b>coil,</b> and thus only “U ” tube <b>condenser</b> <b>coil</b> was considered in the study. With straight “U ” tubes inserted into the tank, it was found that the convective heat transfer was not strong enough to break water temperature stratification in the tank, which resulted in a temperature differential of 16 ºC (30 ºF) from top to bottom. However, when the coil was built in an“L ” shape, the water stratification disappeared. A computational fluid dynamics code, CFD, was used to study the straight and “L ” shaped <b>condenser</b> <b>coils.</b> Results from CFD simulation were compared with the experimental data and found to be close to each other...|$|R

40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model is developed in ANSYS Fluent for simulating the heat transfer and fluid dynamics in the water tank of a US-type residential heat pump water heating unit that utilizes a wrap-around <b>coil</b> <b>condenser</b> that transfers heat from refrigerant to water through the tank wall. The linked modelling process involves iteration between the CFD model of the water tank and a vapor compression system model (using EES) in describing quasi-steady warm up of a heat pump water heating system. The models are connected via temperatures and heat transfer at the tank wall. The models and the linking procedure are validated experimentally based upon a quasi-steady approach. A wholesome understanding of heat distribution and fluid dynamics in the water tank can enable design optimizations of coil geometry, placement (pitch), etc. Performance is influenced by profiles of water temperature in the tank and refrigerant in the condenser, assuming constant pressure drop, during various warm-up experiments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} the results of the experimental tests of the cooling performance of a 12, 000 -Btu/h modified air conditioner (referred to as M-AC) that use the ground as a heat sink of a condenser. In the tests, cooling capacity of M-AC with an optimal length of a <b>condensing</b> <b>coil</b> as well as life expectancy of copper coil buried underground were investigated. The lengths of copper coil fabricated and used as <b>condenser</b> <b>coil</b> of M-AC were set at 67, 50, 40 and 30 m whereas that of a 12, 000 -Btu/h conventional split-type air conditioner (referred to as C-AC) was about 22 m. The results showed that the ground can absorb heat rejected from a condenser of M-AC. The coefficient of performance (COP) of C-AC was about 2. 5 whereas those of M-AC were found to be higher. It was found that the values of COP of M-AC with <b>condensing</b> <b>coils</b> of 67, 50 and 40 m long were about 6. 9, 5. 5 and 3. 3, respectively, while that of 30 -m-long one was found to be about 2. 1.

Experimental designs of an evaporator <b>coil,</b> <b>condenser</b> <b>coil</b> and capillary tube are investigated through the development of storage periods in terms of steady state and cyclic performance, by optimising the quantity of refrigerant charge, with strict adherence to the standards and requirement for maintaining an internal temperature of - 23 °C at 43 °C ambient.
