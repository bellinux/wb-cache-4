5000|$|Statisticians in {{response}} surface methodology (RSM) advocate the [...] "sequential assembly" [...] of designs: In the RSM approach, a <b>screening</b> <b>design</b> {{is followed by}} a [...] "follow-up design" [...] that resolves only the confounded interactions judged worth resolution. A second follow-up design may be added (time and resources allowing) to explore possible high-order univariate effects of the remaining variables, as high-order univariate effects are less likely in variables already eliminated for having no linear effect. With the economy of screening designs and the flexibility of follow-up designs, sequential designs have great statistical efficiency. The sequential designs of response surface methodology require far fewer experimental runs than would a sequence of Taguchi's designs.|$|E
30|$|The multi-resolution {{optimization}} {{improve the}} two-phase relaxation optimization for a large-scale reconfigurable RF front-end. The multi-resolution optimization narrows down the search space into <b>screening</b> <b>design</b> sets of available configurations in a large-scale RF front-end. The size of <b>screening</b> <b>design</b> sets {{is determined by}} the number of active reconfiguration knob bits in all RF components. The fewer active bits of knobs, the more sparsely the characteristic values of the configurations in the <b>screening</b> <b>design</b> sets are distributed. The multi-resolution optimization tries to search for two types of configurations in the two phases, from small to large active bits. If there is no improvement for one cycle of iterations for all configurations, the iterative reconfiguration is stopped. The pseudocode of the multi-resolution algorithm is given in Algorithm 3 (Appendix).|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} extend the RF {{impairments}} estimated for configurations in the <b>screening</b> <b>design</b> set to the full-factorial design set, the interpolation method is applied. Recollect that the configurations in the <b>screening</b> <b>design</b> set only use {{a few of the}} most significant bit (MSB) bits of each component, with the other bits frozen to zero. The assumption made here is that the bits of each component define a real number (or set of real numbers) and that the true RF impairment is a continuous function of this (set of) real numbers.|$|E

In practice, however, this assumption is unreasonable. We shall examine step-wise group <b>screening</b> <b>designs</b> without errors in observations when this assumption is relaxed. We shall consider cancellations of effects within group-factors. The performance of step-wise group-screening designs shall then be compared with the performance of multistage group <b>screening</b> <b>designs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Two level {{non-regular}} {{designs are}} widely used in industrial experimentation for factor screening. At the initial stage of experimentation, {{it is not possible}} to know in advance which factors are active so it is necessary to choose the <b>screening</b> <b>design</b> that can accommodate as many models as possible. In this thesis, we have used D-efficiency criteria to evaluate projections onto three dimensions with and without blocking and onto four dimensions without blocking for some <b>screening</b> <b>design</b> with small number of runs. The investigated designs are the 12 run Plackett-Burman designs (PB), the Minimum Resolution IV 10 and 12 runs design, and the John s ¾ design in 12 run. Overall, 12 run PB designs came out as the preferable choice of design. Only in a few cases, it was out performed by the 12 run Minimum Resolution IV design. </p...|$|E

The present paper introduces a formulation study of gentamicin loaded biodegradable nanoparticles (Nps). Solid-oil-in water technique was studied for gentamicin sulfate nanoencapsulation using uncapped Polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA-H) and Polylactide-co-glycolide-co-Polyethylenglycol (PLGA-PEG) blends. <b>Screening</b> <b>design</b> was applied to optimize: drug payload, Nps size and size distribution, stability and resuspendability after freeze-drying. PLGA-PEG concentration resulted most significant factor influencing particles size and drug content (DC) : 8 w/w% DC and 200 nm Nps were obtained. Stirring rate resulted most influencing factor for size distribution (PDI) : 700 rpm permitted to obtain homogeneous Nps dispersion (PDI = 1). Further experimental parameters investigated, by 23 <b>screening</b> <b>design,</b> were: polymer blend composition (PLGA-PEG and PLGA-H), Polyvinylalcohol (PVA) and methanol concentrations into aqueous phase.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{identify}} process parameters and modeling features affecting interfacial heat transfer coefficients in the casting of a semi-solid 357 aluminum alloy. A 2 -level <b>screening</b> <b>design</b> was created to evaluate the effect of 5 process parameters on these coefficients. The varied parameters were the following: set die temperature, intensification pressure, plunger velocity, lubricant type and lubricant quantity. The interfacial heat transfer coefficients were calculated with an inverse heat conduction method using as inputs the measured die temperatures obtained from the various casting conditions in the <b>screening</b> <b>design.</b> The effects of these process parameters were quantified considering 2 response variables: the peak value of the coefficients and the time the coefficients decreased to 5 % of their peak value. The intensification pressure {{was found to be}} dominant for both response variables. It was also observed that features in the finite element model used to solve the inverse heat conduction problem affected the coefficients. The features investigated in the model were: the thermocouple cavity, its depth, its base angle and the presence of the thermocouple inside the cavity. The depth at which the thermocouple cavity was modeled was found to be the prevailing feature affecting the coefficients. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
