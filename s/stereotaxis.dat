However, complex arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation require long procedures with additional risks such as X-ray exposure or serious complications such as tamponade. Given this context, the treatment of arrhythmias using robotic magnetic navigation entails a technique well suited to complex arrhythmias on account of its efficacy, reliability, significant reduction in X-ray exposure for both patient and operator, as well as a very low risk of perforation. As ongoing developments will likely improve results and procedure times, this technology will {{become one of the most}} modern technologies for treating arrhythmias. Based on the literature, this review summarizes the advantages and limitations of robotic magnetic navigation for ablation of human arrhythmias.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{assessed}} {{feasibility of}} magnetic catheter guidance {{in patients with}} atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing circumferential pulmonary vein ablation (CPVA). BackgroundNo data are available on feasibility of remote navigation for AF ablation. MethodsForty patients underwent CPVA for symptomatic AF using the NIOBE II remote magnetic system (<b>Stereotaxis</b> Inc., St. Louis, Missouri). Ablation was performed with a 4 -mm tip, magnetic catheter (65 °C, maximum 50 W, 15 s). The catheter tip was guided by a uniform magnetic field (0. 08 -T), and a motor drive (Cardiodrive unit, <b>Stereotaxis</b> Inc.). Left atrium maps were created using an integrated CARTO RMT system (<b>Stereotaxis</b> Inc.). End point of ablation was voltage abatement > 90 % of bipolar electrogram amplitude. ResultsRemote ablation was successful in 38 of 40 patients without complications. The median mapping and ablation time was 152. 5 min (range, 90 to 380 min) but was much longer in the first 12 patients (192. 5 min vs. 148 min; p = 0. 012). Median ablation time was 49. 5 min (range, 17 to 154 min), but it was much shorter in the last 28 patients than in the first 12 patients (49 min vs. 70 min; p = 0. 021). Patients receiving remote ablation had longer procedure times than control patients (p < 0. 001) with similar mapping time but shorter ablation time on right-sided pulmonary veins. Many more mapping points regardless of their location were collected remotely (p < 0. 001). ConclusionsRemote magnetic navigation for AF ablation is safe and feasible with a short learning curve.

Methods and materialsTen pairs of plans for patients with locally advanced inoperable cervical cancer were created using MR based 3 D brachytherapy and <b>stereotaxis</b> CK. The dose that covers 98 % of the target volume (HR CTV D 98) was taken as a reference and other parameters were compared. ResultsOf the ten studied cases, the dose from D 100 GTV was comparable for both devices, on average, the BT GTV D 90 was 10 – 20 % higher than for CK. The HR CTV D 90 was higher for CK with an average difference of 10 – 20 %, but only fifteen percent of HR CTV (the peripheral part) received a higher dose from CK, while 85 % of the target volume received higher doses from BT. We found a significant organ-sparing effect of CK compared to brachytherapy (20 – 30 % lower doses in 0. 1 cm 3, 1 cm 3, and 2 cm 3).

40|$|Background: Calcium channel {{blockers}} have {{an important}} role in treatment of various cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, angina pectoris and cardiac arrhythmias, so study of cardiovascular effects of derivatives of these drugs are useful. Nifedipine is one of these drugs that used widely to treat hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the central effects of synthesized dihydropyridine derivatives on systolic blood pressure and heart rate of rats and comparison to nifedipine. Methods: Sixty four male rats, after induction of anesthesia and intracerebral ventricu-lar cannulation using <b>stereotaxis</b> method, were divided into eight equal groups. One week after the <b>stereotaxis</b> surgery, the systolic blood pressure and heart rate were eval-uated in times 15 to 60 minutes after intracerebral ventricular injection of DMSO (di-methylsulfoxide) and nifedipine in doses of 80 to 320 microgram/rat and also three synthesized dihydropyridine derivatives (A, B and C) in dose of 240 microgram/rat. Effects of these drugs on systolic blood pressure and heart rate were analyzed using two way repeated measure ANOVA statistical test, followed by Bonferroni posthoc test. All data were considered significant at P< 0. 05. Results: The inhibitory effects of derivative B on systolic blood pressure and heart rate in dose of 240 microgram/rat in times of 15 and 30 minutes after injection were more potent than nifedipine (P< 0. 001), while A and C derivatives showed weaker inhibitory properties, compared with nifedipine. Also the inhibitory effects of derivative B on heart rate in dose of 240 microgram/rat were stronger than nifedipine in times of 15 to 60 minutes after injection (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Novel dihydropyridine derivatives can possess more potent and stable in-hibitory effects on systolic blood pressure and heart rate, and some part of these properties at least, can be attributed to their direct inhibitory effects on brain neurons...|$|E

40|$|The {{formulation}} of current-to-force relationships for magnetic actuators proceeds {{in a fairly}} straightforward fashion from Maxwell's equations for magnetostatic problems. However, the inverse problem of determining a set of currents to realize a desired force is less well understood.

The objective {{of this paper is}} to evaluate: (i) the performance of the 3 D reconstruction software which reproduce the anatomy of the coronary sinus (CS) and (ii) the efficacy of remotely navigating a magnetic guidewire within the CS based on this reconstruction. Methods and results: In patients undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy implantation, a 3 D reconstruction of the CS was performed using the CardiOp-B™ system. Accuracy of the reconstruction was evaluated by comparing with the CS angiogram. This reconstruction was imported into the <b>Stereotaxis</b> system. On the basis of the reconstruction, magnetic vectors were automatically selected to navigate within the CS and manually adjusted if required. Feasibility of deploying the guidewire and LV lead into the selected side branch (SB), fluoroscopy time (FT) required for cannulation of the target SB, and total FT were also evaluated. Sixteen patients were included. In one case, the software could not reconstruct the CS. The quality of the reconstruction was graded as good in 13 and poor in 2. In 10 cases, manual adjustments to the traced edges of the CS were required to perform the 3 D reconstruction, and in 5, no adjustments were required. In 13 patients, the target SB was engaged on the basis of the automatically selected vectors. In two cases, manual modification of the vector was required. Mean total FT was 23 ± 14 min and the FT required to cannulate the target SB was 1. 7 ± 1. 3 min. Conclusion: A 3 D reconstruction of the CS can be accurately performed using two angiographic views.

30|$|Because {{of their}} {{druggable}} enzymatic activity, DUBs {{can be considered}} as therapeutic targets. Although proteasome inhibitor has been approved for the therapy of multiple myeloma (Hoy, 2013), there are still no DUB inhibitors endorsed for clinical usage. However, multiple studies already revealed such possibilities. As an example, P 1130 -mediated inhibition of tumor-activated DUBs results in downregulation of antiapoptotic and upregulation of proapoptotic proteins, such as MCL- 1 and p 53, thereby causing tumor cell apoptosis (Kapuria et al., 2010). A selective inhibitor of the DUB USP 14 could be effective against neurodegenerative diseases and myeloma (Lee et al., 2010). Using <b>stereotaxis,</b> direct incubation into brain tumors with PR- 619, a broad-spectrum DUB inhibitor, could limit the concentrations of TβR-I and p-SMAD 2, in which the effective target is considered to be USP 15 (Eichhorn et al., 2012).

Despite advances in the treatment of gliomas, no effective therapeutic approach is yet available; hence, the search for a more realistic model to generate more effective therapies is essential.

Moreover, surgery {{is becoming more and more}} complex, and a basic specialist training is by far not sufficient to master all interventions. Moreover, basis surgical skills (<b>stereotaxis,</b> knotting skills, etc.) should ideally be acquired before entering the operating theater and performing surgery on patients. Since many years in the UK, there has been an ongoing debate about surgical competence. The majority view is that surgical competence should be based on clinical judgement, operative skills, and cognitive ability. The assessment of technical ability should be based on standardized checklists. Also, the call for competence checks during the professional career of surgeons (e.g., every 5  years) becomes louder [20, 21].|$|E
