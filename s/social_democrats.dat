5|$|After {{the decades}} of {{political}} disappointments, the February Revolution offered the Finnish <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> momentum for power; they held the absolute majority in the Parliament. The conservatives were alarmed by the continuous increase of the socialists' might since 1899, with the climax in 1917 without the offsetting control of Russian administration; the <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> had to be halted before {{they were able to}} markedly alter the power structure.|$|E
5|$|Drnovšek's {{announcement}} {{that he would}} not run for president again led to expectations that the <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> (SD) would nominate their leader Borut Pahor and indeed Pahor confirmed that he was ready to run for the office. The <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> had become the most popular party in opinion polls and were considered the likely winners at the next general election in 2008; opinion polls indicated that Pahor would easily win the presidential election. However, after months of mixed signals, Pahor finally announced that he would instead concentrate on the general election and would not run for the mostly ceremonial office of the president.|$|E
5|$|During the First Austrian Republic, pan-Germanists were {{represented}} by the Greater German People's Party and the agrarian Landbund.

Both the Christian Socials and the <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats</b> accepted that unification between Austria and Germany was forbidden by the Treaty of Saint-Germain. A conflict would develop, however, between those who supported an Austrian national identity, such as the Christian Socials, and those rooted in German nationalism, such as the <b>Social</b> <b>Democrats.</b>|$|E

Other critiques of the consensus policy came from anti-Vietnam War activists, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the anti-nuclear movement.|$|E

This reflected the public opinion that with the Munich attackers having left the country, the risk of further terrorist acts against German targets had diminished. Criticism evolved around the lack of sufficient airport security to prevent explosives being smuggled into passenger airliners, and Lufthansa not employing sky marshals, which at that time were already common on certain flights by El Al, Pan Am, Swissair, and others.|$|E
