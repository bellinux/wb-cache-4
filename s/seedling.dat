The disadvantages are that, they belong to tray raising <b>seedlings</b> mode which needs large fields and trays, and the labor intensity is too hard. In order to reduce the area and raise the level of raising <b>seedlings</b> mechanization, a kind of rice factory three-dimensional raising <b>seedlings</b> system was presented, which is consisted of greenhouse, <b>seedlings</b> frame, carpet seeder and so on.

Percentage of germination increased with time from 2 days till 16 days in case of <b>seedlings</b> grown on MS medium, and 10 days in case of <b>seedlings</b> grown on agar. Variations in <b>seedlings</b> length at 10, 20 and 30 days were non significant. <b>Seedlings</b> grown on agar were longer than <b>seedlings</b> grown on MS medium.

Manipulation of {{seedlings}} in the same study area showed that B. aemula grows longer roots seeking water and that seedlings do grow in wet heath, but it is as yet unclear why the species does not grow in wet heath as well as dry heath. Unlike similar situations with banksia species in Western Australia, the two species {{did not appear to}} impact negatively on each other. A field study on <b>seedling</b> recruitment conducted at Broadwater National Park and Dirrawong Reserve on the New South Wales North Coast showed that generally Banksia aemula produced seedlings in low numbers but the attrition rate was low, and that seedlings had a greater survival rate on dry rather than wet heaths. Field work including the experimental planting out of seedlings at Crowdy Bay National Park showed that Banksia aemula <b>seedling</b> roots reach the water table within six months of germination, and that they can germinate in {{the presence or absence of}} recent bushfire. The reasons for bradyspory (that is fewer seeds with greater percentage of survival) is unclear, but may be a defence against seed-eating animals. Similarly in field work on North Stradbroke Island, B.aemula was noted to shed its winged seeds over time between (as well as after) fire, and germinate and grow readily with little predation by herbivores.|$|E

5|$|Cordyline australis is a light-demanding pioneer species, and {{seedlings}} die when overtopped {{by other}} trees. To grow well, young plants require open space {{so they are}} not shaded out by other vegetation. Another requirement is water during the <b>seedling</b> stage. Although adult trees can store water and are drought resistant, seedlings need a good supply of water to survive. This stops the species from growing in sand dunes unless there are wet depressions present, and from hillsides {{unless there is a}} seepage area. The fertility of the soil is another factor—settlers in Canterbury used the presence of the species to situate their homesteads and gardens. The fallen leaves of the tree also help to raise the fertility of the soil when they break down. Another factor is temperature, especially the degree of frost. Young trees are killed by frost, and even old trees can be cut back. This is why C.australis is absent from upland areas and from very frosty inland areas.|$|E

Comparative proteomic analysis of hybrid rice shoot proteins from Shanyou 10 <b>seedlings,</b> a salt-tolerant hybrid variety, and Liangyoupeijiu <b>seedlings,</b> a salt-sensitive hybrid variety, was performed to identify new components involved in salt-stress signaling. Results Phenotypic analysis of one protein that was upregulated during salt-induced stress, cyclophilin 2 (OsCYP 2), indicated that OsCYP 2 transgenic rice <b>seedlings</b> had better tolerance to salt stress than did wild-type <b>seedlings.</b> Interestingly, wild-type <b>seedlings</b> exhibited a marked reduction in maximal photochemical efficiency under salt stress, whereas no such change was observed for OsCYP 2 -transgenic <b>seedlings.</b> OsCYP 2 -transgenic <b>seedlings</b> had lower levels of lipid peroxidation products and higher activities of antioxidant enzymes than wild-type <b>seedlings.</b> Spatiotemporal expression analysis of OsCYP 2 showed {{that it could be}} induced by salt stress in both Shanyou 10 and Liangyoupeijiu <b>seedlings,</b> but Shanyou 10 <b>seedlings</b> showed higher OsCYP 2 expression levels. Moreover, circadian rhythm expression of OsCYP 2 in Shanyou 10 <b>seedlings</b> occurred earlier than in Liangyoupeijiu <b>seedlings.</b> Treatment with PEG, heat, or ABA induced OsCYP 2 expression in Shanyou 10 <b>seedlings</b> but inhibited its expression in Liangyoupeijiu <b>seedlings.</b> Cold stress inhibited OsCYP 2 expression in Shanyou 10 and Liangyoupeijiu <b>seedlings.</b> In addition, OsCYP 2 was strongly expressed in shoots but rarely in roots in two rice hybrid varieties. Conclusions Together, these data suggest that OsCYP 2 may act as a key regulator that controls ROS level by modulating activities of antioxidant enzymes at translation level. OsCYP 2 expression is not only induced by salt stress, but also regulated by circadian rhythm. Moreover, OsCYP 2 is also likely to act as a key component that is involved in signal pathways of other types of stresses-PEG, heat, cold, or ABA. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT-Stomata 1 conductance, transpiration, {{and leaf}} water {{potential}} were measured during the 1996 growing season on baldcypress (Taxodium disfichum (L.) Rich.) <b>seedlings.</b> <b>Seedlings</b> were hand-planted from 1 -O bareroot stock in mesic and permanently Rooded soil conditions. One-half of all <b>seedlings</b> were fitted with 122 -cm tall polyethylene tree shelters, <b>Seedlings</b> were planted 1 {{year before the}} initiation of plant water relation measurements. The study was located within the boundary of the Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant, Kamack, TX. The objective of the research was to study the feasibility of artificially regenerating baldcypress along the shores of Caddo Lake. Stomata 1 conductance and transpiration were consistently higher in <b>seedlings</b> planted in mesic soils versus <b>seedlings</b> planted in permanently flooded soils. <b>Seedlings</b> fitted with shelters regularly had higher stomata 1 conductance and transpiration then <b>seedlings</b> without shelters. Leaf water potential showed little consistency among treatments...|$|R
