5|$|The colonial outpost was a {{traditional}} New England <b>subsistence</b> <b>farming</b> community. The majority of Deerfield's settlers were young families {{with women who}} had moved west in the search of land. Women's labor was essential {{to the survival of}} the settlement and its male inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Malawi is {{predominantly}} agricultural. Over 80% {{of the population}} is engaged in <b>subsistence</b> <b>farming,</b> even though agriculture only contributed to 27% of GDP in 2013. The services sector accounts {{for more than half of}} GDP (54%), compared to 11% for manufacturing and 8% for other industries, including natural uranium mining. Malawi invests more in agriculture (as a share of GDP) than any other African country: 28% of GDP.|$|E
5|$|After the {{departure}} of Massasoit and his men, Squanto remained in Plymouth to teach the Pilgrims how to survive in New England, for example using dead fish to fertilize the soil. For {{the first few years}} of colonial life, the fur trade was the dominant source of income, buying furs from Native Americans and selling to Europeans, beyond <b>subsistence</b> <b>farming.</b> Shortly after {{the departure}} of the Mayflower, Governor Carver suddenly died. William Bradford was elected to replace him and went on to lead the colony through much of its formative years.|$|E
40|$|In Romania, {{the small}} <b>subsistence</b> <b>farms</b> {{proved to be}} very durable. Structural changes led to the {{multifunctional}} development of this household, to vegetable marketing, input supply, investments and agricultural works, storage of products. Gradually, the number of <b>subsistence</b> <b>farms</b> will decrease in favour of forming a viable commercial sector and economic diversification in Romanian rural area...|$|R
50|$|Grain storage on a <b>subsistence</b> <b>farm</b> is {{primarily}} {{based on a}} minimize loss of grain basis. In modern agricultural practices there are methods of managing under 1% grain loss yet on these small <b>subsistence</b> <b>farms</b> they potential see 20% - 100% of grain loss. This cause starvation and unstable food supply. This is grain loss from mold growth, bugs, birds, or any other contamination manner. Some methods of preventing loss is hermetic grain storage. Hermetic grain storage strives to eliminate all exchange of gases within the storage system to mitigate bacterial activity as well as rodents and bugs {{from being able to}} breathe inside the storage systems. With introduction of hermetic grain storage to these <b>subsistence</b> <b>farms</b> we create a more stable food supply in the area and help with the starvation.|$|R
50|$|Over the years, Leota has {{remained}} deeply connected to agricultural roots. Much {{of the surrounding}} township remains active in agriculture through large <b>farms,</b> <b>subsistence</b> <b>farms,</b> household gardens and local husbandry.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the dry climate, timber—a main {{component}} in building earthquake-resistant homes—is scarce in Qayen; homes are instead constructed of adobe. The inhabitants of the poverty-stricken region rely on <b>subsistence</b> <b>farming,</b> raising livestock and crops such as wheat and saffron. When the earthquake struck, much of the population was already working in the fields; for the most part, these people survived. Many of those treated for injuries were found to be undernourished.|$|E
5|$|The Mesa Verdeans survived using a {{combination}} of hunting, gathering, and <b>subsistence</b> <b>farming</b> of crops such as corn, beans, and squash. They built the mesa's first pueblos sometime after 650, {{and by the end of}} the 12th century, they began to construct the massive cliff dwellings for which the park is best known. By 1285, following a period of social and environmental instability driven by a series of severe and prolonged droughts, they abandoned the area and moved south to locations in Arizona and New Mexico, including Rio Chama, Pajarito Plateau, and Santa Fe.|$|E
5|$|The park's {{land was}} once home to Native Americans, {{followed}} by settlers who cleared the forests for <b>subsistence</b> <b>farming</b> and later built sawmills. The second growth forests in and surrounding Worlds End State Park are partially {{a result of}} the efforts of the young men of the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. They helped overcome the clearcutting of the early 20th century, and built many of the park's facilities, including the cabins that earned it a place on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
50|$|Gurúè's economy depends {{mainly on}} the tea {{plantations}} (90%), though other plantation types {{can also be found}} such as coffee, fruit, etc. Most people also have small <b>subsistence</b> <b>farms</b> to supplement their irregular salaries.|$|R
50|$|Born in La Crosse, Wisconsin, O'Callaghan later {{moved to}} Sparta, where his family <b>subsistence</b> <b>farmed.</b> He lied {{about his age}} to join the U.S. Marine Corps, {{at the age of}} 16 and served from 1946 to 1948.|$|R
50|$|Manchukuo was a {{productive}} area, with many domestic animals in <b>subsistence</b> <b>farms</b> or larger properties. Japanese experts increased production {{with the introduction}} of foreign species, including pigs, cattle, and sheep, which produced milk, meat, leather and wool.|$|R
5|$|The two-sector system {{approach}} models {{the economy}} as two separate systems: one involving the standard macroeconomic variables, while the other includes gender-specific variables. William Darity developed a two-sector approach for low-income, farm-based economies. Darity shows that <b>subsistence</b> <b>farming</b> depended on the labor of women, while the production of income depended on the labor of {{both men and women}} in cash-crop activities. This model shows that when men control production and income, they seek to maximize income by persuading women to put additional effort into cash-crop production, causing increases in cash crops {{come at the expense of}} subsistence production.|$|E
5|$|Modern animal {{husbandry}} relies on production systems {{adapted to the}} type of land available. <b>Subsistence</b> <b>farming</b> is being superseded by intensive animal farming in the more developed parts of the world, where for example beef cattle are kept in high density feedlots, and thousands of chickens may be raised in broiler houses or batteries. On poorer soil such as in uplands, animals are often kept more extensively, and may be allowed to roam widely, foraging for themselves. Most livestock are herbivores, except for the pig which is an omnivore. Ruminants like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass; they can forage outdoors, or may be fed entirely or in part on rations richer in energy and protein, such as pelleted cereals. Pigs and poultry cannot digest the cellulose in forage, and require cereals and other high-energy foods.|$|E
5|$|Over 80% of Chad's {{population}} {{relies on}} <b>subsistence</b> <b>farming</b> and livestock raising for its livelihood. The crops grown and {{the locations of}} herds {{are determined by the}} local climate. In the southernmost 10% of the territory lies the nation's most fertile cropland, with rich yields of sorghum and millet. In the Sahel only the hardier varieties of millet grow, and these with much lower yields than in the south. On the other hand, the Sahel is ideal pastureland for large herds of commercial cattle and for goats, sheep, donkeys and horses. The Sahara's scattered oases support only some dates and legumes. Chad's cities face serious difficulties of municipal infrastructure; only 48% of urban residents have access to potable water and only 2% to basic sanitation.|$|E
50|$|The {{students}} at the Spanish schools would have been required {{to work on the}} <b>subsistence</b> <b>farm</b> operated by the school. Parents of {{students at}} the schools complained about the quality and nutritional value of the meals being fed to the children.|$|R
50|$|Oiseau Bay {{was settled}} as a farming {{homestead}} in the mid-19th century. In {{the tradition of}} the pioneers of the Ottawa Valley, the men in the family would <b>subsistence</b> <b>farm</b> during the summer months, and leave to work in the lumber camps during the winter.|$|R
50|$|The African-American {{community}} of Mulberry Hills was established after the Civil War for freed slaves {{who had lived}} and worked in the area prior to the war. Similar to Brown's Woods on the north shore of Mill Creek, Mulberry Hill was subdivided into approximately 5 acre <b>subsistence</b> <b>farms.</b>|$|R
5|$|Through {{the late}} 17th century, the various clans {{of the eastern}} coastal region were governed by chieftains who {{typically}} ruled over one or two villages. A zana-malata named Ratsimilaho emerged to unite these clans under his rule in 1710. His reign lasted 50 years and established a sense of common identity and stability throughout the kingdom, but his successors gradually weakened this union, leaving it vulnerable to the growing influence and presence of European and particularly French settlers, slave traders, missionaries and merchants. The fractured Betsimisaraka kingdom was easily colonised in 1817 by Radama I, king of Imerina who ruled from its capital at Antananarivo in the central highlands. The subjugation of the Betsimisaraka in the 19th century left the population relatively impoverished; under colonisation by the French (1896-1960) a focused {{effort was made to}} increase access to education and paid employment working on French plantations. Production of former plantation crops like vanilla, ylang-ylang, coconut oil and coffee remain the principal economic activity of the region beyond <b>subsistence</b> <b>farming</b> and fishing, although mining is also a source of income.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, {{thousands}} of settlers, attracted {{in part by}} the lure of free land, began emigrating west over the Oregon Trail. Leaving drought, worn-out farms, and economic problems behind, they emigrated from states like Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa in the Midwest to Oregon, especially the Willamette Valley {{in the western part of}} the state. After passage of the Homestead Act of 1862 and the discovery of gold in the upper John Day basin, a fraction of these newcomers abandoned the Willamette Valley in favor of eastern Oregon. Some established villages and engaged in <b>subsistence</b> <b>farming</b> and ranching near streams. Settlement was made more practical by a supply route from The Dalles on the Columbia River to gold mines at Canyon City in the upper John Day valley. By the late 1860s, the route became formalized as The Dalles Military Road, which passed along Bridge Creek and south of Sheep Rock. Clashes between natives and non-natives and the desire of the U.S. Government to populate the region with Euro-Americans led to the gradual removal of native residents to reservations, including three in north-central Oregon: Warm Springs, Burns Paiute, and Umatilla.|$|E

50|$|Today, {{most people}} in San Pedro have <b>subsistence</b> <b>farms</b> or work in forestry. San Pedro has {{the highest rate of}} poverty among Misiones' departments: 40% of people do not have their basic needs satisfied. Outside the town of San Pedro, only 15% of farmers own their own land.|$|R
50|$|This breed {{is uniquely}} adapted to {{extensive}} or low input farming systems. Historically, {{the most suitable}} and natural environment for these cattle has been on small scale forage-based <b>farms,</b> <b>subsistence</b> <b>farms,</b> and homesteads. It is on such farms and homesteads that the unique genetic attributes of the Randalls can be fully expressed..|$|R
50|$|Wilson {{was born}} to Eston and Jessie Richardson Wilson, who had {{migrated}} to the West Virginia coalfields from <b>subsistence</b> <b>farms</b> in Carter County, Tennessee during the Great Depression. The Wilsons had eight children, four sons and four daughters. Only six survived to adulthood, of which Quentin was third oldest, and eldest son.|$|R
25|$|<b>Subsistence</b> <b>farming</b> {{is practiced}} to satisfy family or local needs alone, with little {{left over for}} {{transport}} elsewhere. It is intensively practiced in Monsoon Asia and South-East Asia.|$|E
25|$|Forestry, farming, {{and fishing}} are also major {{components}} of GDP. <b>Subsistence</b> <b>farming</b> predominates. The {{deterioration of the}} rural economy under successive brutal regimes has diminished any potential for agriculture-led growth.|$|E
25|$|The colonial {{economy of}} {{what would become the}} United States was pre-industrial, {{primarily}} characterized by <b>subsistence</b> <b>farming.</b> Farm households also were engaged in handicraft production, mostly for home consumption, but with some goods sold.|$|E
40|$|The human {{perception}} of nonhuman primates is often one of contradiction, typi-fied by extremes. In some cultures and contexts (e. g., Hindus of Bhutan, India, Nepal) primates {{are viewed as}} sacred, in others such as China or Japan, they are mythical creatures of cunning and deviousness, while {{for most of the}} world’s <b>subsistence</b> <b>farm...</b>|$|R
50|$|Early European {{settlers}} {{had small}} <b>subsistence</b> <b>farms,</b> {{but most of}} the inhabitants' income from that time to the present have been derived from the sea.Shelburne lies at the southwest corner of Nova Scotia, at roughly the same latitude as Portland, Maine in the United States.

5000|$|During 2007-2008, {{a project}} which {{involved}} interviewing {{a number of}} different farming families was completed. This provides an audiovisual display of different types of farms from around Yorkshire, including dairy, sheep, pigs and arable crops, both organic and those using agrochemicals, an artificial inseminater and some <b>subsistence</b> <b>farms.</b> A new audiovisual room was built as part of the project.|$|R
25|$|Agriculture employs 30% of the Filipino {{workforce}} as of 2014. Agriculture {{accounts for}} 11% of Philippines GDP as of 2014. The {{type of activity}} ranges from small <b>subsistence</b> <b>farming</b> and fishing to large commercial ventures with significant export focus.|$|E
25|$|They {{settled in}} the backcountry {{throughout}} the South and relied on <b>subsistence</b> <b>farming.</b> Mostly they did not own slaves.

25|$|In particular, {{wood from}} {{tropical}} rainforests is rarely harvested for paper {{because of their}} heterogeneity. According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat, the overwhelming direct cause of deforestation is <b>subsistence</b> <b>farming</b> (48% of deforestation) and commercial agriculture (32%), which is linked to food, not paper production.|$|E
50|$|Fusarium wilt (Panama disease) is {{the most}} serious disease of banana, {{threatening}} 80% of the world's banana production, most of which is planted with the susceptible Cavendish varieties. Bananas are a staple food in the diet of millions throughout the subtropics and tropics, and the spread of Panama disease could have devastating effects on both large scale production and <b>subsistence</b> <b>farms.</b>|$|R
50|$|Two {{occupants}} {{have left}} memoirs {{of their life}} in the house. The first was John Dimon Bradley, son of Aljah and Elizabeth, who described life on what was mainly a <b>subsistence</b> <b>farm</b> in the 19th century.
