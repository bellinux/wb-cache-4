40|$|Procedural {{position}} of a person whose domicile is unknown in light of "Brussels I Regulation" One {{of the results of}} the removal of obstacles that previously used to prevent EU citizens from moving into another member state is, among others, an increase in the number of contracts entered into with nationals from other member states. Connected therewith there has been an increase in the number of cases involving a foreign element taken before courts of the member states. Many of those cases are in fact brought against persons whose domiciles are unknown. To be precise, in practice it is defendants on whom it is not possible to serve the process and at the same time the court has no information regarding their domiciles. Not only is it impossible to find out whether they are in the Czech Republic, but the question is whether they are in the EU at all. In such a case it is necessary to consider whether it is possible to apply the rules of Brussels I Regulation, whose operation is based on the principle of domicile of the <b>sued</b> <b>party,</b> for the determination of jurisdiction in proceedings against such defendants. Besides this basic issue the paper also deals with the assessment of whether it is possible to apply, in the proceedings against a person whose domicile is unknown, domestic institutes which are [...] ...|$|E

Four of the ten nations (the United States, France, Italy and Germany) had {{withdrawn}} entirely from the court's “optional clause.” Because Yugoslavia filed its complaint only three days after accepting {{the terms of the}} court's optional clause, the ICJ ruled that there was no jurisdiction to sue either Britain or Spain, as the two nations had only agreed to submit to ICJ lawsuits if a <b>suing</b> <b>party</b> had filed their complaint a year or more after accepting the terms of the optional clause.

50|$|In TDP v. Benkiser, Judge Benavides {{weighed in}} on a {{controversial}} election-year ballot dispute. After Congressman Tom DeLay resigned from Congress, the Republican Party of Texas sought to replace him with another candidate on the ballot shortly before the 2006 election. Texas law, however, forbids candidates from being replaced {{in the months leading}} up to an election unless they are ruled ineligible. The Texas Democratic <b>Party</b> <b>sued</b> the Republican <b>Party</b> to stop the switch. In court, the Republican Party argued that Tom DeLay was in fact ineligible to run for Congress in Texas because he had recently moved to Virginia.|$|R
25|$|In {{a typical}} class action, a {{plaintiff}} sues a defendant or {{a number of}} defendants {{on behalf of a}} group, or class, of absent parties. This differs from a traditional lawsuit, where one <b>party</b> <b>sues</b> another <b>party</b> for redress of a wrong, and all of the parties are present in court. Although standards differ between states and countries, class actions are most common where the allegations involve {{a large number of people}} (usually 40 or more) who have been injured by the same defendant in the same way. Instead of each damaged person bringing his or her own lawsuit, the class action allows all the claims of all class members—whether they know they have been damaged or not—to be resolved in a single proceeding through the efforts of the representative plaintiff(s) and appointed class counsel.|$|R
5000|$|Chaplin's {{half-brother}} Sydney {{directed and}} starred in a 1921 film called King, Queen, Joker in which, like Chaplin, he played the dual role of a barber and ruler of a country which {{is about to be}} overthrown. More than twenty years later, in 1947, Charles Chaplin was sued over alleged plagiarism with The Great Dictator. Yet, apparently, neither the <b>suing</b> <b>party</b> nor Chaplin himself brought up his own brother's King, Queen, Joker of the silent era. The case, Bercovici v. Chaplin, was settled, with Chaplin paying Konrad Bercovici $95,000. Bercovici claimed that he had created ideas such as Chaplin playing a dictator and a dance with a globe, and that Chaplin had discussed his five-page outline for a screenplay with him for several hours. But Chaplin insisted in his autobiography that he had been the sole writer of the movie's script. He agreed to a settlement, because of his [...] "unpopularity in the States at that moment and being under such court pressure, he was terrified, not knowing what to expect next." ...|$|R

50|$|In August 2006 Mainstream Media's {{two hundred}} news portals went offline {{for several days}} when the domain name on which its Toronto-based servers were hosted was stolen and sold on eBay for $20,000.

5000|$|The {{party had}} three councillors on South Ribble District Council by 2007.

2500|$|Legal tender is {{a narrow}} {{technical}} concept for {{the settlement of}} debt, and it has little practical meaning for many everyday transactions such as buying goods in shops. But it does apply, for example, to the settlement of a restaurant bill, where the food has been eaten prior to demand for payment and so a debt exists. Essentially, any two parties can agree to any item of value as a medium for exchange when making a purchase (in that sense, all money is ultimately an extended form of barter). If a debt exists that is legally enforceable and the debtor party offers to pay with some item that is not [...] "legal tender", the creditor may refuse such payment and declare that the debtor is in default of payment; if the debtor offers payment in legal tender, the creditor is required to accept it or else the creditor is in breach of contract. Thus, if in England party A owes party B 1,000 pounds sterling and offers to pay in Northern Irish banknotes, party B may refuse and <b>sue</b> <b>party</b> A for non-payment; if party A provides Bank of England notes, party B must acknowledge the debt as legally paid even if party B would prefer some other form of payment.|$|R
50|$|Critics {{have argued}} that climate change {{litigation}} under CEQA has been time-consuming and expensive. Considered {{as one of the}} most controversial lawsuit by some critics, San Bernardino County v State of California was opposed by several local governments and industries for these very reasons. For example, many Republican senators feared that the lawsuit would set precedent for new GHG analyses that would limit future development. As a result, some senators sought to obtain a “prohibition on CEQA climate litigation” by delaying passage of the state budget. San Bernardino County officials also argued that the litigation was unnecessary and that requiring the County to implement mitigation measures prior to implementation of AB 32 was unreasonable. Criticism has also been levied against Attorney General Settlements related to CEQA and climate change. In particular, settlement items required as part of the San Bernardino and ConocoPhillips cases dismayed some legal practitioners. Individuals {{have argued that}} the Attorney General and other <b>suing</b> <b>parties</b> have not taken a consistent approach in addressing global warming through the use of settlement agreements. For example, some allege that the San Bernardino settlement was primarily structural, requiring GHG inventories and mitigation, whereas the ConocoPhillips settlement relied heavily on carbon offsets, as opposed to onsite mitigation.|$|R
