25|$|Strategies {{to provide}} {{education}} cost effectively include deworming children, which costs about 50 cents per child {{per year and}} reduces non-attendance from anemia, illness and malnutrition, while being only a twenty-fifth as expensive as increasing school attendance by constructing schools. Schoolgirl absenteeism could be cut in half by simply providing free <b>sanitary</b> <b>towels.</b> Fortification with micronutrients was ranked the most cost effective aid strategy by the Copenhagen Consensus. For example, iodised salt costs 2 to 3 cents per person a year while even moderate iodine deficiency in pregnancy shaves off 10 to 15 IQ points. Paying for school meals is argued to be an efficient strategy in increasing school enrollment, reducing absenteeism and increasing student attention.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} and acceptability of ethamsylate, mefenamic acid, and tranexamic acid for treating menorrhagia. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: A university department {{of obstetrics and}} gynaecology. SUBJECTS: 76 women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment for five days from day 1 of menses during three consecutive menstrual periods. 27 patients were randomised to take ethamsylate 500 mg six hourly, 23 patients to take mefenamic acid 500 mg eight hourly, and 26 patients to take tranexamic acid 1 g six hourly. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Menstrual loss measured by the alkaline haematin method in three control menstrual periods and three menstrual periods during treatment; duration of bleeding; patient's estimation of blood loss; <b>sanitary</b> <b>towel</b> usage; the occurrence of dysmenorrhoea; and unwanted events. RESULTS: Ethamsylate did not reduce mean menstrual blood loss whereas mefenamic acid reduced blood loss by 20 % (mean blood loss 186 ml before treatment, 148 ml during treatment) and tranexamic acid reduced blood loss by 54 % (mean blood loss 164 ml before treatment, 75 ml during treatment). <b>Sanitary</b> <b>towel</b> usage was significantly reduced in patients treated with mefenamic acid and tranexamic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Tranexamic acid given during menstruation is a safe and highly effective treatment for excessive bleeding. Patients with dysfunctional uterine bleeding should be offered medical treatment with tranexamic acid before a decision is made about surgery...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the effect of Lavandula angustifolia (lavender) {{inhalation}} on the symptoms of dysmenorrhea and the amount of menstrual bleeding in female students with primary dysmenorrhea. Design: This study is an experimental clinical trial. The subjects were 96 female students residing in dormitory at Tehran University of Medical Sciences in 2011 and suffering from level two or three dysmenorrhea according to the verbal multi-dimensional scoring system. The inclusion criteria were as: being single, suffering from primary dysmenorrhea, having no genital organs disorder, having no systemic disease, having regular menstrual cycles, using no contraceptives, etc. The follow-up time was 4 menstrual cycles. Interventions: The subjects were randomized into two groups: experimental (n = 48) who inhaled lavender based on sesame oil, and placebo (n = 48) who inhaled sesame oil only. Main outcome measures: The severity of dysmenorrhea symptoms was measured through a questionnaire, and the amount of menstrual bleeding was measured by <b>sanitary</b> <b>towel</b> usage. Methods: Ordinal logistic regression and generalized estimating equation (GEE) were used to analyze the data. Results: The symptoms of dysmenorrhea were significantly lowered in the lavender group compared to the placebo group (p < 0. 001). The amount of menstrual bleeding in the lavender group was reduced in comparison to the placebo group but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0. 25). No significant difference was observed for blood clot among the students (p = 0. 666). Conclusions: This study showed that lavender inhalation was effective in alleviating dysmenorrhea symptoms, suggesting that it could be applied by midwives in a safe manner because of no side effects, simplicity and cost-effectiveness for all patients.
