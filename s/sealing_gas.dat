Synthetic oil mist contained in the <b>sealing</b> <b>gas</b> {{was identified as a}} significant source of contamination that caused the seal failures. Since similar dry gas seals in other compressors at the same location were operating satisfactorily, a study of a particular compressor was undertaken. The seals were instrumented with thermocouples to monitor the temperature distribution across the seals. This paper discusses the findings of the study, resulting modifications of the dry gas seals, seal controls, and the compressor itself. This paper also outlines techniques that have been developed to mitigate the situation without having to shut the unit down. Also presented is a design approach to the sealing and seal monitoring in processes where liquid ingress into the sealing area may occur, including seal material selection, control system philosophy, seal head, and bearing cavity design...|$|E
40|$|The {{sintering}} behaviour of {{a composite}} material formed by a borosilicate glass (60 SiO 2 - 24 B 2 O 3 - 16 Na 2 O mol%) and zirconia fibres has been characterised {{as a function}} of the particle size of the glass powders, the fibre volume fraction, temperature and time of sintering. This composite is suitable for <b>sealing</b> <b>gas</b> manifolds of molten carbonate fuel cells, and the sintering temperatures are close to the working temperature of the cell (650 °C). The Clusters model was extended and used to analyse the results. New considerations are included in the model to account for the presence of rigid inclusions. The parameters of the modified model are: the size distribution of the glass powder, the viscosity and surface tension of the glass, the (empirical) shape factor for the geometry of the glass powder, the number of nucleating sites per unit area, the crystal growth rate curve, the fibre volume fraction and length. The Clusters model allows one to include the effect of surface crystallisation and fibre content as an inhibitor of densification and successfully describes the sintering kinetics of the borosilicate glass/zirconia fibres system...|$|E
40|$|TutorialTutorial 19 B: Traditionally double seals {{have been}} used for low {{pressure}} applications when nitrogen gas at pressure higher than process was available for sealing. Double seals were not applied to low pressure processes where process contamination by nitrogen was not permitted. In these cases application of the process gas for sealing in a double seal was considered ?unsafe? and the preference was given to a tandem seal. In recent years this approach has been re-evaluated and additional steps to insure safety in case of a secondary seal failure undertaken. Since both tandem and double seals can be used for applications with sealing pressure below approximately 40 bar, what benefits are to be gained by double seal application? Double seal arrangement, among other things, allows for system simplification and more reliable operation, significant reduction of <b>sealing</b> <b>gas</b> volumes, prevention of seal reverse pressurization and shorter in-between the bearings shaft span. A possibility of secondary seal failure and prevention of uncontrolled process gas emission can be addressed {{in a variety of ways}} - from incorporation of flow restriction to utilization of separation seal as safety seal...|$|E
40|$|Technical BriefTechnical Brief 1 : This {{paper will}} discuss the {{challenges}} with contamination of <b>gas</b> <b>seals.</b> The reliability of <b>gas</b> <b>seals</b> is largely dependent on having a continuous supply of clean and dry <b>seal</b> <b>gas.</b> In dynamic mode, gas supply systems take product gas from a higher pressure level in the compressor, filter it {{and use it to}} create the ideal environment for the <b>gas</b> <b>seal.</b> This typically ensures that the <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> is provided with effective protection against contaminated process <b>gas.</b> Compressor <b>gas</b> <b>seals</b> are very robust sealing devices, but need to be operated in a dry and clean environment. The leading root cause of <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> failures is contamination. One of the most common sources of contamination is during compressor start up, slow-roll, standstill, or shutdown modes or because the conditioning skid is not sufficient. In these modes {{there is a lack of}} <b>seal</b> <b>gas</b> flow, which suggests no means to produce <b>seal</b> <b>gas</b> flow is available, such as a high pressure gas source or booster for the <b>seal</b> <b>gas</b> supply. This is where it pays to have a reliable, clean <b>gas</b> supply. Without <b>seal</b> <b>gas</b> flow, sufficient <b>seal</b> <b>gas</b> cannot be provided to the <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> and results in the <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> being contaminated. This paper will describe contamination to the <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> by process <b>gas,</b> during commissioning, by particle and by liquids, which are caused by inadequate <b>seal</b> <b>gas</b> supply. Then it will focus on different methods of providing <b>seal</b> <b>gas</b> flow during transient conditions. And finally, it will discuss solutions to ensure a reliable, clean gas flow to the seal at all relevant conditions together with additional possibilities to add robustness to <b>gas</b> <b>seals...</b>|$|R

40|$|Cryostar {{has been}} a world leader in radial inflow turbine {{technology}} for more than 30 years but is a relative newcomer in the geothermal business. Experience gained during the design and production of two turbo-expanders coupled to a generator for binary cycles has shown that standard expanders can easily be used for geothermal or heat recovery applications. The Main concern of the corrosion resistance of turbine elements against a corrosive working fluid like ammonia-water mixture can be solved with a rigorous selection of materials. The other concern is about <b>sealing</b> <b>gas</b> management in a close cycle loop. The Dry Gas Seal solution allows the seal gas flow to be decreased to very low values. The recompression of the leaking gas back into the cycle offers a zero leakage system. Process data for binary cycles are ideal for radial inflow turbines: pressure ratios, flows and temperatures ensure an operation {{very close to the}} maximum achievable isentropic efficiency. Other losses in gear boxes, generator and bearings typically do not exceed in total 10 % of the total isentropic enthalpy drop. For this reason the larger units can recover almost 85 % electricity compared to the total isentropic enthalpy drop. Another benefit in using radial inflow turbine in standard execution with variable inlet nozzles is the ability to smooth seasonal variations inherent to geothermal process. In fact, this device can be used to control the flow widely through the expander without wasteful throttling. All the expansion energy in the nozzles and wheel is recovered almost at constant isentropic efficiency throughout the year. The advantages of operating at higher pressure levels and with lighter organic fluid than usual are explained. It increases the recovered electrical power, whilst decreasing the expander frame size and its price. In most of the cases there is a large benefit to optimise the binary cycle process data together with the turbine design to offer the best net cycle efficiency...|$|E

As a result the ring is meant to conform closely to the cylinder surface which promotes increased friction. The compression ring is subjected to combustion pressure loading, ring tension, varying inertial force and friction. It is a slender ring of low mass, thus undergoes complex elastodynamic behaviour, when subjected to a multitude of forces. These motions occur in the ring’s radial in-plane and axial out-of-plane dynamics, which comprise flutter, ring axial jump, compression-extension, ring twist and rotational drag. An implication of these motions can be loss of <b>sealing,</b> <b>gas</b> blow-by, loss of power and lubricant degradation/oil loss, to name but a few. Consequently, understanding and accurately predicting ring dynamic behaviour under transient conditions is an important step in any subsequent modelling for evaluation of cylinder system efficiency. There have been a plethora of investigations for ring dynamics, often decoupling the ring behaviour in its in-plane and out-of-plane motions. This approach disregards any transfer of dynamic energy from one degree of freedom to another which is only applicable to rectangular ring cross-sections. Alternatively, there are computationally intensive approaches such as finite element analysis (FEA) which are not conducive for inclusion in any subsequent system level engine modelling where ring response alters in an instantaneous manner. This would require embedded FEA within a transient analysis. This paper presents a finite difference numerical analysis for coupled in-plane and out-of-plane motions of compression rings with practical cross-sectional geometries, which are mostly not rectangular. The formulated method can be integrated into a system level transient cyclic analysis of ring-bore contact. The presented approach takes into account the energy transfer between different degrees of freedom. The predictions are validated against precise non-contact measurements of ring elastodynamic behaviour under amplitude-frequency sweeps. This approach has not hitherto been reported in literature and constitutes the main contribution of the paper...|$|E

40|$|Insulating glass (IG) is {{comprised}} of two plates of glass that lie close to one another without touching. The plates are separated by a <b>sealed</b> <b>gas</b> space that consists of a spacer material that surrounds the perimeter of each plate. This spacer does not allow gas flow into {{or out of the}} IG unit. IG must consist of at least two plates of glass, but can be expanded to three plates of glass where there would be two <b>sealed</b> <b>gas</b> spaces. As a result of the configuration of IG units, the load that is distributed between the plates will vary based on the properties of the glass, the initial conditions of the unit, and the properties of the spacer material. It has long been understood that the load sharing between double pane IG units can be influenced by different factors in the unit.

40|$|Lecturepg. 69 There {{has been}} a rapid growth in the {{application}} of noncontacting double <b>seals</b> with a <b>gas</b> buffer fluid to pump sealing. The advantages of such a sealing arrangement are: ?	There is no liquid buffer fluid to maintain or dispose of. ?	Gas buffer fluid causes a minimum of contamination to the process. ?	There are no emissions, so no monitoring may be required. ?	Friction power is only a fraction of that associated with liquid seals. ?	Because there is no contact, seal life can be several times that of a liquid/contacting seal. One of the limitations of a conventional double seal arrangement, be it gas or liquid, is that there must be either considerable axial length or considerable diametral space available. There are many pump applications that could benefit from a double <b>gas</b> buffered <b>sealing</b> system where space is severely limited. Thus, {{there is a need for}} a small size double <b>gas</b> <b>sealing</b> device. The double <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> with coplanar coaxial Rayleigh pad faces has two <b>gas</b> <b>sealing</b> faces concentrically located on the same plane. Buffer gas is supplied to an annular groove between the two sealing faces. The outside <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> leaks to process and the inside <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> leaks to atmosphere. Both faces have Rayleigh step pad lifting surfaces as well as a sealing dam similar to a conventional <b>gas</b> <b>seal.</b> The process fluid is to the outside of the outer seal face so as to minimize process fluid contamination of the <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> face. With the configuration described, the double <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> with coplanar coaxial faces can be made into a small package that fits entirely into a seal gland, which itself has minimum dimensions. Thus this seal will fit to most conventional small bore ANSI pumps, and this makes it possible to apply double <b>gas</b> <b>sealing</b> technology to many existing process pumps. In this paper, the theory of the double <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> with coplanar coaxial faces is described. Considerable design work was required to find useable shapes and balance moments on the seal so that the inside and outside sealing gaps stay open under variable process and gas supply pressures. Optimization of the Rayleigh step pad bearings was performed. A complete simulation model was developed. Deflection results and predicted performance (leakage) are presented. Extensive testing has been conducted, and the paper presents predicted and measured leakage as a function of process and gas pressure. Loss-of-gas testing has also been performed, and these results are presented. Several field tests have been initiated and these are described. Observation so far has been that the seal performs as expected, so the double <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> with coplanar coaxial faces can be used to provide double <b>gas</b> <b>sealing</b> solutions for many pumps having limited available space...|$|R
