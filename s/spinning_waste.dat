40|$|The use {{of natural}} resources, {{especially}} processing wastes, as low cost and environmentally friendly alternative aiming high value-added applications is a subject of broad interest. Since the Brazilian silk production annually generates {{a large amount of}} waste during the silk fibers processing, this work explores the preparation and characterization of silk fibroin hydrogels using <b>spinning</b> <b>waste</b> silk fibers from textile processing and the processed ones. Hydrogels were obtained directly by dialyzing silk fibroin solutions against frequent changes of water until the gelation point and then lyophilized and characterized in terms of their morphology, crystallinity, thermal resistance and secondary structure. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the presence of β-sheet conformation related to sol-gel transition. FT-IR spectra indicated the coexistence of random coil (silk I) and β-sheet (silk II) structures, with predominance of β-sheet conformation for hydrogels from processed silk fibers. From thermogravimetric analysis the presence of β-sheet secondary conformation was demonstrated by a degradation peak around 292 °C for both hydrogels. Freeze-dried hydrogels presented sheet or leaf like morphology and no significant change was observed among the hydrogels from waste silk fibers and processed ones. These characteristics suggest that silk fibroin hydrogels prepared from <b>spinning</b> <b>waste</b> silk fibers and obtained directly by dialysis can be potential candidates for biomaterials application, such as drug delivery systems and for wound dressings...|$|E

40|$|Several {{thousand}} independent {{processes are}} required to produce a single semicon-doctor chip. This thesis focuses on one: the process of coating a silicon wafer with photoresist. The conventional spin coating method produces uniform photoresist coating of the desired thickness. However, conventional <b>spin</b> coating <b>wastes</b> 95 % of the photoresist applied for every batch process. As photoresist is not recyclable, spin coating method is very inefficient. Moreover, an imminent increase in cost of photoresist has raised the demand for new coating technologies. Various methods for improving coating efficiency have been investigated. Based upon a comprehensive literature search and theoretical analysis, dramatic increases in efficiency and reductions in costs proved to be possible with the optimization of the dispense stage in spin coating. In the novel dispense process developed in this thesis, extrusion-spin coating replaces the conventional dispense stage. A major advantage of this method is its compatability with current spin coating method: little modification of existing spin coaters is required for this new technology...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{fabrication of}} purely ceramic submicron fibers by rotary jet-spinning – a recently developed method. An inertial force {{is used to}} form fibrous jets made of viscous dispersions, which then solidify during solvent evaporation. Precursor suspensions were prepared {{with the use of}} water as the only solvent, non-toxic Fe 2 O 3 ceramic powder and poly(ethylene oxide) – a fiber-forming agent. The obtained fibers were in the range of 0. 2 – 1. 4 mm in diameter. This work presents a concept that utilizes ceramic fibers that could potentially be used for arsenic removal based on adsorption-enhanced filtration. We prove that ceramic fibers can be formed by simply adding non-agglomerated particles to a polymer solution. The nonwoven fiber-based approach will allow higher flow rates of the filtrate during purification and enable heat treatment for cleaning the filters.

Unfortunately, locks are not the only primitives that are needed to build concurrent programs. In particular, there are many cases where a thread wishes to check whether a condition is true before continuing its execution. For example, a parent thread might wish to check whether a child thread has completed before continuing (this is often called a join()); how should such a wait be implemented? Let’s look at an example (Figure 22. 1). What {{we would like to see}} here is the following output: parent: begin child parent: end We could try using a shared variable, as follows you see in Figure 22. 2. This solution will work (note that you don’t even have to lock the variable) but it is hugely inefficient, as the parent <b>spins</b> and <b>wastes</b> CPU time. What we would like here instead is some way to put the parent to sleep until the condition we are waiting for (e. g., the child is done executing) comes true.

40|$|Textile {{effluents}} usually contain {{high concentrations}} of inorganics as well as organics, and are therefore difficult to treat. Membrane processes {{can be used for}} many of these wastewaters in the textile industry. Two typical examples are discussed: (1) the use of nanofiltration for the treatment of exhausted dye baths, in view of water recycling, and (2) the use of ultrafiltration for the removal of <b>spin</b> finish from <b>waste</b> water resulting from rinsing of textile fibres. Both applications are in principle feasible, but in practice the process is negatively influenced by membrane fouling. In the first application, fouling is assumed to be caused by (ad) sorption of organic compounds, which has a large influence because of the high concentrations used in textile dyeing. Furthermore, the high salt concentrations result in a decrease of the effective driving force because of the high osmotic pressures obtained for typical dye baths. Experimental results are discussed, and the applicability of nanofiltration is related to the characteristics of the dye baths for different dyeing methods. In the second application, the concentration of organic compounds is relatively low, but because of the hydrophobic nature of the spin finish compounds, a significant effect of membrane fouling is expected. An improvement is suggested by using nanofiltration membranes instead of ultrafiltration membranes. status: publishe...|$|R

Waste generation involves a loss of materials and energy and imposes high environmental and economic costs to society - of collection, treatment and processing. Therefore we believe that the desire of "zero waste" is currently one of the strategic directions for sustainable development of a society based on knowledge. Suggested solutions to reduce pollution exercised by textiles products various measures were proposed, such as: sound management of waste, recycling and the increase of "green" products in the all textile products...|$|R
