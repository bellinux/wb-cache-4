40|$|This paper {{presents}} the pattern language for specification of communication protocols. The pattern language contains four levels {{which are used}} to specify communication protocol and its messages. These four levels of this pattern language are: high-level protocol specification, protocol structure <b>specification,</b> <b>message</b> specification, and detailed message specification. Several existing patterns, e. g. the Layers, are used together with new ones to specify protocol structure. Patterns for communication protocol messages are {{most important part of}} this pattern language, and also most important part of any communication protocol specification. ...|$|E
40|$|A Message Sequence Chart(MSC) {{depicts the}} desired {{exchange}} of messages between {{the processes of}} a system. They are used for scenario-based specification of systems, where a run would mean a series of message exchanges. Message Sequence Graphs (MSGs), where each vertex is a MSC, is {{a natural extension of}} this concept. From such specifications of combined behavior, it is desired to derive the individual behavior of each of the processes such that their interactions realize the given <b>specification.</b> <b>Message</b> passing automata has already been suggested as the basic model for such realizations. These automata need no synchronization to perform their actions. As a result they can realize only some special sets of MSCs. In this work, we extend the above model with limited synchronization so as to realize a specification given by any arbitrary set of MSCs or as an MSG...|$|E
40|$|Contact between English and Ghanaian {{languages}} due to Ghana’s anglophone colonial heritage {{has resulted}} in the manifestation of several language contact phenomena. The contact phenomenon of codeswitching (CS) is addressed in this study. Akan bilinguals engage in Akan-English CS in their day-to-day activities. The study investigates and provides insights into the purposes Akan-English CS serves, using data from a popular Ghanaian TV talk show called THE DELAY SHOW. A combination of theories and approaches to the study of CS are employed in this study. The main theoretical bases for data analysis are John Gumperz (1982), Conversational Analysis by Peter Auer (1984) and The Markedness Model by Carol Myers-Scotton (1993). These theories were used to investigate the conversational uses of Akan-English CS among Akan bilinguals; how the sequential order of their conversations influences their CS; and the social motivations for Akan-English codeswitching. The outcomes of the study show that Akan bilinguals use CS for quotations, interjections, reiteration, addressee <b>specification,</b> <b>message</b> qualification, personalisation verses objectivization, numbers, proper nouns, contrast, and to fill lexical gaps. The findings also show that the sequential order of a conversation has an influence on the meaning of a switch. Thus, sequential analysis led to the interpretation of certain instances of CS among Akan bilinguals as signalling changes in topic and signalling the main issue under discussion. Furthermore, the study shows some social motivations for Akan-English CS. Akan bilinguals were found to employ CS to index certain social identities and as a deferential strategy. The study recommends that more research should be undertaken on codeswitching between Ghanaian languages and English, as well as codeswitching between different Ghanaian languages to provide more insights into the topic. This is because the functions and motivations for codeswitching indicate that CS is an effective tool that the Ghanaian bilingual can use to express him/herself fully. However, future researchers should include a larger number of participants and apply attitudinal studies in their methodology to investigate what the code-switchers themselves feel about CS...|$|E

40|$|Data about {{products}} and services {{is of paramount importance}} in most inter-organizational business processes. For business-to-business (B 2 B) scenarios, a great number of XML-based <b>message</b> <b>specifications</b> are available, which cover various processes and types of transactions. These specifications support the respective data exchange tasks by providing a common representation for {{products and}} services in the form of syntactical conventions with some light-weight formal semantics. However, an analysis of the underlying models shows that technical product data and commercial product data are being represented in a fundamentally different manner. In particular show the commercial models both a higher syntactical complexity and more semantic heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose to align the representation of technical and commercial views on product data in <b>message</b> <b>specifications.</b> Our approach is based on the PLIB ontology, which was originally described in ISO 13584. We have evaluated our proposal by applying it to an industrial <b>message</b> <b>specification</b> for electronic catalogs, and can show that the novel approach reduces representational mismatches in B 2 B processes and simplifies systems integration in such scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Most {{existing}} routing mechanisms today {{differ in}} routing objectives and routing strategies, however all the existing routing protocols {{have in common}} that the routing objective and destination specification are fixed, and that the routing objective is incorporated only implicitly. In this paper, we propose a general <b>message</b> <b>specification</b> mechanism to explicitly encode the routing destinations, constraints and objectives in messages, so that general-purpose instead of objective or destination specific routing strategies can be applied. Using general-purpose routing strategies while specifying quality-of-service (QoS) properties at the application layer explicitly in messages, QoS-aware strategies for individual messages are obtained. We also propose two frameworks of general-purpose routing strategies {{for this type of}} <b>message</b> <b>specification.</b> I...|$|R
