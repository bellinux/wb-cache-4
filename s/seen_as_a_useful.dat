5|$|In August 2012, the 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron {{returned}} from a six-month tour in Afghanistan. Its 9 B-1Bs flew 770 sorties, {{the most of any}} B-1B squadron on a single deployment. The squadron spent 9,500 hours airborne, keeping one of its bombers in the air at all times. They accounted for a quarter of all combat aircraft sorties over the country during that time and fulfilled an average of two to three air support requests per day. On 4 September 2013, a B-1B participated in a maritime evaluation exercise, deploying munitions such as laser-guided 500lb GBU-54 bombs, 500lb and 2,000lb Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), and Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM). The aim was to detect and engage several small craft using existing weapons and tactics developed from conventional warfare against ground targets; the B-1 is <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> asset for maritime duties such as patrolling shipping lanes.|$|E

25|$|Chromatophores are {{sometimes}} used in applied research. For example, zebrafish larvae {{are used to}} study how chromatophores organise and communicate to accurately generate the regular horizontal striped pattern as seen in adult fish. This is <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> model system for understanding patterning in the evolutionary developmental biology field. Chromatophore biology has also been used to model human condition or disease, including melanoma and albinism. Recently, the gene responsible for the melanophore-specific golden zebrafish strain, Slc24a5, was shown to have a human equivalent that strongly correlates with skin colour.|$|E

Unfortunately, the social environment is often ignored. This leads to inappropriate systems being developed for these areas.

25|$|Catherine {{was born}} at the Ducal Palace of Vila Viçosa, as the second {{surviving}} daughter of John, 8th Duke of Braganza and his wife, Luisa de Guzmán. Following the Portuguese Restoration War, her father was acclaimed King John IV of Portugal, on 1 December 1640. With her father's new position as one of Europe's most important monarchs, Catherine became a prime choice for a wife for European royalty, and she was proposed as a bride for John of Austria, François de Vendôme, duc de Beaufort, Louis XIV and Charles II, She was <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> conduit for contracting an alliance between Portugal and England, after the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659 in which Portugal was arguably abandoned by France. Despite her country's ongoing struggle with Spain, Catherine enjoyed a happy, contented childhood in her beloved Lisbon.|$|E

[...] The character customization in World Tour was generally seen as an improvement over the limitations of Rock Band. [...] However, reviewers noted that the use of the real-life celebrities against the cartoon-like visuals, along with the emphasis on the band and not individual players, made their presence [...] "anachronistic".|$|E

The main {{attraction}} was the dock, with its large volume of coal traffic, but they purchased both the canal and the dock for £64,000, {{under the terms of}} an Act of Parliament obtained that year, which included a requirement that there should always be [...] "a good and sufficient water communication between the towns of Taunton and Bridgwater". Unlike many such acquisitions, the canal was <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> adjunct to the railway network, and was maintained in good order for several years, with the Conservators of the River Tone continuing their annual inspections, and reporting any defects to the railway company.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{weak and}} {{inconsistent}} enemy artificial intelligence {{was a common}} subject of criticism. GameSpot described the behaviour of enemies as [...] "They see, they run, they shoot - and that's about it", while N64 Magazine noted that they regularly fail to spot the player even when standing next to them. The gadgery was <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> gameplay feature, with AllGame noting that players {{need to figure out}} the proper way to use each gadget. Although GameZone highlighted the multiplayer mode for its replay value and teamplay options, critics agreed that the game felt short in comparison to Perfect Dark. The artificial intelligence of multiplayer bots was also a frequent criticism. According to GameSpot, [...] "they generally amount to nothing more than fragging".

40|$|In {{this article}} {{it will be}} shown how results from [2] {{can be used to}} decide wether, for a range of propositional paralogics and {{adaptive}} logics L, A 1, [...] ., An #L B is derivable by means of a resolution method for C 1, [...] ., Cn D, where C 1, [...] ., Cn and D are the translations of the original premisses and the conclusion respectively from L into CL. This method simplifies the use of automated deduction for non-classical logics, since the framework for these logics can be put "on top of" any existing resolution method for classical logic. This theoretical framework has been implemented in a computer program. The URL where this program is available will be given. This approach, moreover, makes it easier to compare the derivability of well formed formulas from sets of premisses between the implemented range of logics. The resulting computer program can thus be <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>useful</b> tool for research in logics...|$|R

[...] Previously the connotations of [...] "creativity" [...] were reserved for and primarily restricted to, working artists.

After the employment of the Irish Picquets in support of the Jacobite rising in Scotland showed the danger of such a policy, measures were taken to reduce the flow of Irish recruits to French service.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study that compares counts of links to the home pages of {{academic}} journals with the citation based Impact Factor for two disciplines: library and information science; and law. A significant correlation between these two measures was found for both subjects covered with law showing a weaker relationship, although neither relationship was particularly strong. The weakness may be attributable to journal specific factors that encourage more linking such as: computing-related content or particularly well developed Web sites; and wide distribution, perhaps including to a non-academic audience that may link to the journal but would not be citing it. It {{is also possible that}} insularity in a discipline may inhibit link counts but not Impact Factors. This exercise can be <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> (<b>a)</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> way to re-examine the journal Impact Factors and (b) investigating a technique that is a potential source of additional information about the impact of a journal, particularly in terms of reaching out beyond a purely academic audience.
