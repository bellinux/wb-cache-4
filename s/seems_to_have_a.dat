5|$|After {{five years}} of absence, Edie returns to Wisteria Lane with her mysterious husband, Dave (Neal McDonough), who <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> calming effect on his ill-tempered wife. Later, Dave {{receives}} {{a phone call from}} Dr. Samuel Heller (Stephen Spinella), who reminds him that monthly check-ins are a condition of his release. After the conversation, Dr. Heller reviews a taped therapy session in which Dave threatens to get revenge on the man who destroyed his life.|$|E
5|$|Bombard weaponry: The oldest {{representation}} of a bombard {{can be found in}} the Chinese town of Ta-tsu. In 1985, the Canadian historian Robin Yates visited the Buddhist cave temples when he saw a sculpture on the wall depicting a demon holding a hand-held bombard. The muzzle <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> blast and flames coming from it which some believe is proof of some type of super gun. Yates examined the cave and believed the drawings dated back to the late 12th century.|$|E
5|$|With a good {{level of}} {{socialisation}} {{at an early}} age, an American Cocker can get along with people, children, other dogs and other pets. This breed <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> perpetually wagging tail and prefers to be around people; it is not best suited to the backyard alone. Cockers can be easily stressed by loud noises and by rough treatment or handling.|$|E

5|$|Rarely {{will you}} find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or {{predictable}} three-chord blues progressions; {{and never will}} you find them spending much time on the usual pop album of romance, partying, or self-hype. Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging... Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> life of its own... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance.|$|E
5|$|To {{help with}} the {{stresses}} of her various issues – understanding her new relationship with Grayson, dealing with Travis leaving for college, and trying to fit Bobby into her life – Jules (Courteney Cox) has started {{to see a new}} therapist, Glenn (Jennifer Aniston). Jules is able to relate well to Glenn, particularly because Glenn <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> mother-son bond with her son, Gabriel, as close as Jules has with Travis. Ellie (Christa Miller) is skeptical about Glenn's qualifications, and jealous that Jules now prefers to talk about her problems with Glenn instead of her.|$|E
5|$|The {{karyotype}} generally includes 56chromosomes with a {{total of}} 54major arms (2n=56, FN=54) in specimens from both Bolivia and Brazil; a poorly prepared Paraguayan specimen <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> similar karyotype. In this karyotype, all autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) are acrocentric (with one arm so short as to be almost invisible). However, in two specimens from the Brazilian states of Tocantins and São Paulo, one pair of autosomes contains both an acrocentric and a metacentric chromosome (with two equally long arms), yielding an FN of 55. One arm of the metacentric chromosome consists entirely of heterochromatin. Apparently, a whole heterochromatic arm was added to this chromosome; cases of similar variation are known from the rodents Peromyscus, Clyomys, and Thaptomys. Both sex chromosomes are acrocentric, and X is larger than Y. In addition to heterochromatin near the centromere, the Y chromosome contains two large blocks of heterochromatin on its long arm. The karyotype is closely similar to that of Holochilus brasiliensis.|$|E

25|$|Also paeoniflorin <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> detoxifying {{effect on}} the acute {{toxicity}} of aconitine in test animals. This may result from alternations of pharmacokinetic behavior of aconitine in the animals due to the pharmacokinetic interaction between aconitine and paeoniflorin. In addition, in emergencies, one can wash the stomach using either tannic acid or powdered charcoal. Heart stimulants such as strong coffee or caffeine may also help until professional help is available.|$|E
