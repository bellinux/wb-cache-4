500|$|Unlike GoldenEye 007, Perfect Dark {{features}} three multiplayer systems. The {{first is}} a co-operative mode in which two players, or one player and up to three computer-controlled players, can tackle the missions together. If two humans play, the game uses a <b>split</b> <b>screen</b> <b>display,</b> with the option to split horizontally or vertically. Only one human player is required to survive the mission, but all the objectives must be completed. Additionally, the game features a [...] "Counter Operative" [...] mode in which one player plays the missions as Joanna while another takes {{over the role of}} an enemy and attempts to stop her. If this human-controlled guard is killed, the game continues with the Counter Operative player taking control of a different enemy in the level. The game does not tell the player controlling Joanna which enemy the Counter Operative player is controlling.|$|E

50|$|Many {{video games}} support <b>split</b> <b>screen</b> <b>displays</b> {{in order to}} show two or more players in {{different}} regions of the game. <b>Split</b> <b>screen</b> <b>displays</b> would usually <b>split</b> the main <b>screen</b> into either two or four sub-regions so that 2-4 players can roam freely within the game world. Many first-person and third-person shooter games use this technique when played in multiplayer co-op mode, such as the console versions of games in the Rainbow Six series, the Halo series or the fifth installment of the Call of Duty series, Call of Duty: World at War.|$|R

Peshawar Television Centre produced a one-off comeback programme titled Yaad Girina where Akif spoke on his musical career and performed a series of his hit songs. The show was attended by an audience of old musical associates and friends, which included producers, directors, composers, performers and lyricists such as Mohammad Azam Azam. The programme ended with a 56-year-old Akif performing his famous song [...] "Zam Da Husn Jazeero Ta" [...] in a <b>split</b> <b>screen</b> format <b>displaying</b> him singing the same song years earlier at Nishtar Hall, Peshawar.|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the ability for}} pilots to estimate traffic location in an Integrated Hazard Display, and how such estimations should be measured. Twelve pilots viewed static images of traffic scenarios and then estimated the outside world locations of queried traffic represented {{in one of three}} display types (2 D coplanar, 3 D exocentric, and split-screen) and in one of four conditions (display present/blank crossed with outside world present/blank). Overall, the 2 D coplanar display best supported both vertical (compared to 3 D) and lateral (compared to split-screen) traffic position estimation performance. Costs of the 3 D display were associated with perceptual ambiguity. Costs of the <b>split</b> <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> were inferred to result from inappropriate attention allocation. Furthermore, although pilots were faster in estimating traffic locations when relying on memory, accuracy was greatest when the display was available...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Split</b> <b>screen</b> is a <b>display</b> {{technique}} in computer graphics {{that consists of}} dividing graphics and/or text into non-movable adjacent parts, typically two or four rectangular areas. This is done {{in order to allow}} the simultaneous presentation of (usually) related graphical and textual information on a computer <b>display.</b> <b>Split</b> <b>screen</b> differs from windowing systems in that the latter allows overlapping and freely movable parts of the screen (the [...] "windows") to present related as well as unrelated application data to the user, while the former conforms more strictly to the description given in the paragraph above.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate terrain conditions in the vicinity of Daytona Beach, Florida to facilitate selection of suitable landfill sites. LANDSAT computer compatible tapes (CCT 2 ̆ 7 s) were analyzed using various techniques available on the General Electric IMAGE 100 system. Atmospheric haze correction was performed by normalizing the hazy images to a standard spectral reflectance which was obtained for the Atlantic Ocean in the winter season scenes. Histogram analyses and the Image 100 (non-parametric) cellular, or parallelipiped, classification techniques were used to develop the bias necessary for atmospheric haze correction and also to establish the water signatures. Various preprocessing techniques such as channel ratioing, normalization, and principle components (spectral) transformation were tested with <b>split</b> <b>screen</b> <b>displays</b> of scenes from different dates. This display format combined with channel and theme swapping between the quadrants was used for signature analysis and comparison. Slight shifts in registration affected the reliability of signatures developed from these techniques. The most viable approach appeared to be the use of training sites for the development of reliable themes. Signatures were established for various categories in the different test scenes. Swamp and poorly drained areas with minimal vegetative cover were easily delineated for the different time periods, with some exceptions. Hardwood swamps containing bay, maple, and cabbage palm intermixed with cypress produced substantial shifts in the IR bands during the photo-synthesizing period. Flatwoods, planted pine, turkey oak, and the sandy ridge areas were not sufficiently separable spectrally to provide meaningful delineation. Lightly vegetated sandy soils did depict the lineation of relic beach ridges and other sandy, well drained zones...|$|R
5|$|A 24-inch 1080p PlayStation branded 3D television, officially {{called the}} PlayStation 3D Display, was {{released}} in late 2011. A feature of this 3D television is SimulView.

50|$|Mixing {{multiple}} graphics modes in one {{display is}} done simply by providing different character or map mode {{instructions for the}} desired position on screen. For example, the Atari Operating System graphics modes 1 through 8 offer full <b>screen</b> <b>display,</b> or an option for a four-line text window {{at the bottom of}} the <b>screen.</b> This <b>split</b> <b>screen</b> feature is accomplished using the inherent capabilities of ANTIC and its Display List without any CPU interrupts or custom manipulation of the video hardware.|$|R
