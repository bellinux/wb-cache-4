50|$|Helenium elegans is {{an annual}} herb up to 120 cm (4 feet) tall. <b>Stems</b> have <b>wings,</b> {{meaning that they}} have flaps of tissue running down the sides. One plant can produce 200 or more small flower heads, in {{branching}} arrays. The head is very nearly spherical, nearly covered {{with as many as}} 700 disc florets, each floret yellow near the base but brown towards the tip. There are also 1-17 yellow or brown ray florets. The species grows along streambanks and in ditches.|$|R
50|$|These are annual herbs. The {{alternately}} arranged, toothed {{leaves are}} decurrent, the bases wrapping the <b>stem</b> to form <b>wings.</b> The flower heads are solitary or borne in loose panicle inflorescences. The heads contain yellow disc florets, and some species have yellow ray florets. The fruit has a pappus with an outer row of wide, membranous scales and an inner row of longer, narrower scales.|$|R
50|$|Thistles {{are known}} for their effusive flower heads, usually purple, rose or pink, also yellow or white. The {{radially}} symmetrical disc flowers are {{at the end of the}} branches and are visited by many kinds of insects, featuring a generalised pollination syndrome. They have erect stems and prickly leaves, with a characteristic enlarged base of the flower which is commonly spiny. The leaves are alternate, and some species can be slightly hairy. Extensions from the leaf base down the <b>stem,</b> called <b>wings,</b> can be lacking (Cirsium arvense), conspicuous (Cirsium vulgare), or inconspicuous. They can spread by seed, and also by rhizomes below the surface (Cirsium arvense). The seed has tufts of tiny hair, or pappus, which can carry them far by wind.|$|R

Though stepped buildings in New York City {{had been a}} common solution for Manhattan's strict 1916 zoning policies regarding adequate light and air, there were no such restrictions in Providence; nevertheless, New York architects Walker & Gillette chose to include the innovative symmetrical stepped massing, {{with the assistance of}} local architect George Frederick Hall.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{precursor}} to the current external bearings/through spindle design was developed by Sweet Parts, a micro manufacturer of high end cranks and <b>stems.</b> Their Sweet <b>Wings</b> cranks from the early 1990s incorporated the through spindle concept by attaching the two half pipes coming off each crank arm and held together with a single bolt that resided within the cavity of the spindle itself. Their bottom bracket bearing arrangement was a [...] "hybrid" [...] - the right side was internal while the left side was external (and had the 6805-RS sealed bearing, too).|$|R
5000|$|The plant {{grows to}} {{a height of}} about 30 cm and has erect <b>stems</b> with spiny <b>wings.</b> They may be simple or have many branches. The leaves are spiny with toothed or {{serrated}} margins, those at the base forming a rosette and the stem leaves being alternate. The flower stem is tomentose and the pink to lavender flowers are single and bloom in April and May. They have spiny bracts and ovate sepals which are [...] but not spiny. They are followed by fruits known as cypselae which are ovoid and slightly flattened. The calyx persists as pappus or may fall off in rings.|$|R
5000|$|Lathyrus vernus is a {{perennial}} plant with an upright <b>stem</b> without <b>wings.</b> The <b>stem</b> grows to 20 to 40 cm and is erect and nearly hairless. The leaves are alternate with short stalks and large, wide stipules. The leaf blades are pinnate with {{two to four}} pairs of ovate tapering leaflets with blunt tips, entire margins and no tendrils. The inflorescence has a long stem and three to ten purplish-red flowers, each 13 to 20 mm long, turning bluer as they age. These have five sepals and five petals and are irregular. The uppermost petal {{is known as the}} [...] "standard", the lateral two as the [...] "wings" [...] and the lowest two are joined to form the [...] "keel". There are ten stamens and a single carpel. The fruit is a long brown pod up to 60 mm in length containing eight to fourteen seeds which are poisonous. This plant flowers early in the year, in May and June. It can be distinguished from bitter vetch (L. linifolius) and black pea (L. niger) by the breadth of its ovate leaflets. It does not wither after flowering but continues to grow until autumn.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBaccharis glaziovii Baker, Asteraceae, {{also known}} as carqueja or carqueja-arbustinho, is a native shrub of Brazil that reaches 0. 5 - 2. 5 m in height. It is a {{dioecious}} species that blossoms from September to December. This species has cladodes, which are winged stems that belong to the “carquejas” and are widely used indiscriminately by the population due to their gastric and diuretic properties. Carquejas are included in section Caulopterae and are difficult to identify even for taxonomists or Baccharis specialists. In the present study, a morpho-anatomical (cladodes and leaves) analysis of the medicinal plant was undertaken to improve its identification {{and add to the}} knowledge of section Caulopterae. Fragments of cladodes and leaves were collected and prepared in accordance with standard optical and scanning electron microscopy techniques. The morpho-anatomical characteristics found in B. glaziovii, include three-winged <b>stems</b> showing <b>wings</b> in a regular arrangement around the stem axis, short and petiolate leaves, flagelliform and simple non-glandular trichomes, concave-convex midrib, petioles with a concave shape and a slight projection on the adaxial face and convex with three projections on the abaxial surface, and calcium oxalate crystals in the form of raphides, styloids and pyramidal in the perimedullary region of the cladode, when evaluated as a whole, provide support for the quality control...|$|R

50|$|Scrophularia auriculata, the {{shoreline}} figwort or water figwort, is a perennial plant {{of the genus}} Scrophularia in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is found commonly in Western Europe and North Africa, {{on the margins of}} rivers, ponds and similar damp places.It is an upright plant reaching 70 cm with blunt oval, crenate leaves in alternate pairs on the greenish-purple square stem, most leaves may have two small lobes at their base. The spikes of flowers are held stiffly on square stems which arise from the main stem in the angle of the leaf stalks. The square <b>stems</b> have a <b>wing</b> running down each corner. These wings are more obvious than on the closely related common figwort (Scrophularia nodosa). The flowers are small, maroon-brownish and globular with two small lips above and below. The five sepals are green with a white margin, broader on the water figwort than the common figwort. The plant flowers from June to September after when the flowers produce small spherical to pear-shaped capsules containing a large number of seeds.|$|R
50|$|The wood of Strasburgeria {{does not}} have growth rings. Wood vessels are mostly {{isolated}} but sometimes occur in pairs or with three together. The ending of the vessel is very oblique (almost vertical), with twenty to thirty five bars (a state called scalariform). The leaves are simple, hairless, have a short leaf stem, a long inverted egg-shape, and are arranged alternately around the stem. Stipules grow between {{the base of the}} leaf stem and the stem, a rather rare character. Leaf <b>stems</b> have narrow <b>wings</b> on each side, which is a continuation of the leaf blades. Blades are about 12 cm long and 4-5 cm wide, leathery with a rounded tip, have a foot that gradually narrows into the wings of the leaf stem, and have widely spaced teeth along the margins, particularly in the distal half. These teeth are clear to see in leaves on young shoots but become very subtle on leaves on older growth. The tip of the teeth is opaque. The stomata are restricted to the underside (or abaxial surface), and are of the anomocytic type.|$|R
500|$|Borussia {{were drawn}} against Slovan Liberec of the Czech Republic in the quarter–finals, {{the first leg}} was drawn 0–0 draw in Prague. The draw was {{significant}} {{because it was the}} first time in the competition, that Liberec had failed to win at home. Dortmund won the second leg 4–0, after goals from Márcio Amoroso on 51 minutes, Jan Koller on 57 minutes, Lars Ricken on 70 minutes, and finally Ewerthon on 89 minutes. Borussia faced stronger opponents in the semi-finals, when they were drawn with the then five times champions of Europe; Milan. Nevertheless, Borussia won the first leg 4–0, after a hat-trick from Márcio Amoroso, and a goal on 63 minutes from Jörg Heinrich. Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti admitted he was not surprised with the result, stating that, [...] "We knew they had quick strikers. I am more surprised by the terrible performance of our team. The problem <b>stemmed</b> from the <b>wings.</b> I had no reason to change the team because Rui Costa has not trained for ten days. It will be very difficult but it is our duty to give it our best and to try and qualify." [...] In the second leg, Milan won 3–1, with Filippo Inzaghi, and Cosmin Contra scoring within 18 minutes. However, Milan did not get their third goal until injury time when Serginho scored a penalty after Inzaghi was adjudged to have been pulled back by Christoph Metzelder. With Milan still needing one goal to force extra time, Lars Ricken scored for Dortmund in the fourth minute of injury time to put the club into their first European final since winning the 1997 Champions League Final.|$|R
40|$|Developing tissues are out-of-equilibrium {{systems that}} grow and reshape to form organs in adult animals. They are {{typically}} {{composed of a}} large number of cells. The constitutive cells of a tissue perform different roles in tissue development and contribute to the overall tissue shape changes. In this thesis, we construct a hydrodynamic theory of developing epithelial tissues. We use it to investigate the developing wing of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. This theory relates the coarse-grained cell scale properties to the large-scale tissue flows. We explicitly account for the active cellular processes in the tissue that drive tissue flows. In our description of the tissue, we also include the memory effects that are necessary to account for the experimental observations. These memory effects have a significant influence on the tissue rheology. Using this hydrodynamic theory we analyze shear flow in a developing fruit fly wing tissue. We find that the active cellular processes contribute to overall tissue flows and that memory effects are present in the wing tissue. We investigate consequences of these findings on the rheology of tissue shear flow. We find that the memory effects give rise to an inertial response that leads to oscillations in the tissue but it does not <b>stem</b> from the <b>wing</b> mass. Finally, we describe how the tissue rheology is affected by different boundary conditions. We then investigate the area changes during the pupal wing development and we construct a mechanosensitive model for the cell extrusion rate in the pupal wing. Analysis of cell extrusions in the context of this model also allows us to extract information about the cell division properties. Boundary connections between the wing tissue and surrounding cuticle are crucial for the proper development of the pupal wing. A dumpy mutant wing is strongly misshaped during the pupal wing morphogenesis. We use a simple model for the wing to show that the dumpy mutant wing can be described as a wild type wing with compromised boundary conditions. Finally, we analyze cell properties and tissue flows in a developing wing disc epithelium. Motivated by the observation of radially oriented active T 1 transitions in the wing disc epithelium, we use the hydrodynamic theory to investigate the influence of such T 1 transitions on stresses in the tissue. We show that sufficiently strong radially oriented active T 1 transitions can contribute to the control of the tissue size. Results obtained in this thesis extend our understanding of the fly wing tissue rheology and the role of internal and external forces in the proper shaping of the wing epithelium. The hydrodynamic theory we use to describe the fly wing development provides a set of phenomenological parameters that characterize the tissue mechanics and can be experimentally measured. Therefore, we expect that future research will include and extend the hydrodynamic theory presented in this thesis...|$|R
