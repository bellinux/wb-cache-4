5|$|Cisneros and Martínez {{were arrested}} and charged with capital murder, which in Texas is {{punishable}} with a life sentence or death by lethal injection. Cisneros was taken to the Cameron County jail. On her way there, reporters asked if she was responsible for Fischer's murder, and <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Cisneros' husband also refused to comment. The police denied her bail, but her attorney said that she was a respected member of the Brownsville community and deserved bail. Cisneros's attorney told the press that the arrest was a mistake, and that he was confident the police had no solid evidence against her. Police responded by saying they were content with her arrest, but still needed to go after other people involved in the murder plot. Martínez' family also said they were shocked by the arrest, saying they hoped it was a mistake, and {{that they did not know}} the Fischers or Cisneros. On April 13, Cisneros was released from prison on a $300,000 bond, refusing to comment as she left. According to court documents, Cisneros did not go before a judge to obtain a bond. Her attorney reached an agreement with the Cameron County Court District after her bond was denied the week before. Martínez remained in prison, and her bond was set at the same amount the next day. Her lawyer stated that she deserved a bond as well because she was a senior citizen and had a clean criminal record.|$|E
2500|$|Christopher Bowdish, a Bethlehem Police detective, stated that, {{as medical}} {{personnel}} attended to Joan Porco at her home, {{he took a}} moment to ask her whether she could identify her attacker. Bowdish said that when he asked Joan if a family member had done it, Joan used her head to indicate [...] "yes". Bowdish has maintained that when he asked her whether it had been her older son Jonathan, a Naval officer stationed in South Carolina during the attack, <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> indicating it was not, but that she nodded her head up and down, indicating [...] "yes", when he asked her whether Christopher was responsible. Joan Porco's alleged identification of her son Christopher may explain why Bethlehem Police pursued her son soon after the incident, rather than conducting a broader investigation of potential suspects. She also answered in similar ways to other separate questions.|$|E

6000|$|MR. WILLINGS. 'Your son, Mrs. Dowey--he has {{got five}} days' leave.' <b>She</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> slightly, {{or perhaps it}} only trembles a little on its stem. 'Now, now, good news doesn't kill.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> violently, and {{brow and}} neck turned crimson.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{and denied}} the {{imputation}} with much disgust.|$|E

60|$|There is {{emotion in}} Sir John's tone. It is very rough {{on him to}} find his plan of going to Kafoonistan has been outdone by Mrs. Harding's going to Balla Walla. <b>She</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Priscilla!" [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> [...] "how much {{is changed}} since then! You kneel to a dethroned princess. You, the victorious one! But he {{is waiting for}} you. Say what you wish, and leave me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We all ken what sailors are," [...] is {{her dark}} way of denouncing {{those who go}} down to the sea in ships, and then <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and purses up her mouth as if she could tell things about sailors that would make our hair rise.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> sadly, [...] "I {{have been}} exposed to his restlessness and irritability, but they have had no such effect upon me. The {{difference}} between us {{lies in the fact that}} they know this awful secret and I do not." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> and {{sheltered}} the drawing-book again {{under her}} shawl.|$|E

6000|$|The matron smiled complacently in the {{superior}} {{wisdom of the}} Shorter Catechism. 'There is neither marriage nor giving in marriage,' said <b>she,</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> 'This is the spare bedroom, sir, where Mr. Emerson slept when he was here. And now if you will step this way I will show you the study.' ...|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's deep silence. <b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> very slowly.|$|E
60|$|The colour {{faded from}} her face again, and <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> sadly.|$|E
60|$|The {{girl looked}} {{doubtful}} for a moment, and then <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
6000|$|BURNEY, the maid, a {{girl with}} one of those flowery Botticellian [...] faces only met with in England, comes in through the curtained [...] door, which she leaves open, {{disclosing}} the glimpse of a white [...] wall.

Ellen is sparing of her words for a woman; and might be taught manners at least, without spoiling her good looks." ...|$|R
60|$|Again the blankness of non-comprehension. <b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{at him and}} smiled.|$|E
