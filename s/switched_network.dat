25|$|As NBC {{affiliates}} {{in several}} larger markets <b>switched</b> <b>network</b> affiliations and/or dropped the Eyewitness News format {{over the past}} three decades, WTHR is now the largest NBC affiliate to use the Eyewitness News brand continuously to date. This is {{based on the fact that}} the branding was originally synonymous with most ABC owned-and-operated stations, as well as stations owned by Westinghouse Broadcasting (or Group W) that were later acquired by CBS. The station first used the Eyewitness News format from 1969 to 1979 as an ABC affiliate (combining it with the NewsCenter format as Eyewitness NewsCenter 13 from 1976 to 1979, which utilized a format similar to that originated by CITY-TV in Toronto, Ontario, Canada for its CityPulse newscasts) and was restored in 1995. The station debuted an hour-long weekday morning newscast titled Sunrise in February 1987; this was followed by the addition of two-hour weekend morning newscasts in 1993 (which were later retitled under the Weekend Sunrise banner), becoming the first station in the Indianapolis market to expand its morning newscasts to Saturdays and Sundays.|$|E

40|$|L (Logarithmic space) versus NL (Non-deterministic {{logarithmic}} space) {{is one of}} {{the great}} open problems in computational complexity theory. In the paper "Bounds on monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity", we separated monotone analogues of L and NL using a model called the <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> model. In particular, by considering inputs consisting of just a path and isolated vertices, we proved that any monotone <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> solving directed connectivity on N vertices must have size at least N^Ω((N)) and this bound is tight. If we could show a similar result for general <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> solving directed connectivity, then this would prove that L ≠ NL. However, proving lower bounds for general <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> solving directed connectivity requires proving stronger lower bounds on monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity. To work towards this goal, we investigated a different set of inputs which we believed to be hard for monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> to solve and attempted to prove similar lower size bounds. Instead, we found that this set of inputs is actually easy for monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity to solve, yet if we restrict ourselves to certain-knowledge <b>switching</b> <b>networks,</b> which are a simple and intuitive subclass of monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity, then these inputs are indeed hard to solve. In this paper, we give this set of inputs, demonstrate a "weird" polynomially-sized monotone <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> for directed connectivity which solves this set of inputs, and prove that no polynomially-sized certain-knowledge <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> can solve this set of inputs, thus proving that monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity are strictly more powerful than certain-knowledge <b>switching</b> <b>networks.</b> Comment: 15 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

An enhanced self-routing <b>switch</b> <b>network</b> {{with only one}} barrel shifter permutation structure and a shifter-based two-way duplicated <b>switch</b> <b>network</b> are proposed to support 19 and 3 different submatrices defined in IEEE 802. 16 e and IEEE 802. 11 n. These proposed <b>switch</b> <b>networks</b> can route the decoding message in parallel by different sizes without signal congestion. The enhanced self-routing <b>switch</b> <b>network</b> can <b>switch</b> the messages at different expansion factors with the lowest hardware complexity. Under the condition of a smaller expansion factor, the decoder throughput can be enhanced from the two-way duplicated <b>switch</b> <b>network</b> by increasing the parallelism.

Based on different target applications: we categorize WDM optical <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> into two connection models: the wavelength-based model and the fiberlink-based model. Most of existing WDM optical switching networksbelongtothefirst category. In this paper we present new designs for WDM optical <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> under both models by using sparse crossbar switches instead of full crossbar switches in combination with wavelength converters. The newly designed sparse WDM optical <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> have minimum hardware cost {{in terms of both}} the number of crosspoints and the number of wavelength converters.

The actual traversal of the message within the network {{is the responsibility of}} the switching strategy. There are basically two types of switching strategies, a circuit <b>switched</b> <b>network</b> is a network where a path is reserved and blocked off from other messages, till the message is delivered to its destination node. A famous example of circuit <b>switched</b> <b>network</b> is the telephone services, which establish a circuit through many switches for a call. The alternative approach is the packet <b>switched</b> <b>network</b> where messages are broken down into smaller compact entities called packets. Each packet contains a part of data in addition to a sequence number. This implies that each packet can now be transferred individually and assembled at the destination based on the sequence number.|$|E

Consequently, optical communication, and in particular Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technology, has become a versatile transmission medium for many applications. ^ The introduction of WDM technology has resulted in increasing the dimensionality of switching by addition of the wavelength switching domain. A main challenge in designing WDM optical <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> is to provide a nonblocking space wavelength switching capability with optimum hardware and switching complexity. In this dissertation, we address this challenge, and accordingly investigate the problem of designing nonblocking WDM optical <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> with reduced hardware complexity. ^ We propagate a new design philosophy that exploits the unique capability of optical technologies to reduce switching complexity and enhance scalability, and show that such a design philosophy enables novel classes of WDM <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> with many interesting and useful features. ^ We introduce a novel concept of Wavelength-Exchanging WDM <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> that are capable of switching signals simultaneously and seamlessly both in space and wavelength domains. This concept leads to <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> that have the following advantages: (1) reduced size and complexity, (2) a shorter signal path, (3) strict wavelength conversion between two predefined and fixed wavelengths, and (4) transparency to routing algorithms. ^ We introduce a new design approach for multicast WDM <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> based on concentrators and multi-wavelength converters (MWCs) technologies to enhance the design flexibility of nonblocking multicast <b>switching</b> <b>networks.</b> For example, we show {{that it is possible to}} design a nonblocking WDM <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> with full-multicast capability without using 2 ̆ 2 any 2 ̆ 2 power splitters. ...|$|R
