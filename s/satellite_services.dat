5|$|The {{basis for}} TrollSat was an {{agreement}} signed in 2006 between the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Space Centre and Kongsberg <b>Satellite</b> <b>Services.</b> It specified that the Space Centre would install a Kongsberg-built radome, while the Polar Institute would provide power and undertake maintenance. In exchange, they could freely use the earth station {{for their own}} transmission needs. The commercial activities would {{be carried out by}} Kongsberg <b>Satellite</b> <b>Services.</b> A concern was raised regarding if satellite downloading would violate the Antarctic Treaty, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs negated. The station started operations on 1 March 2007 and was officially opened by Prime Minister of Norway, Jens Stoltenberg.|$|E
5|$|All India Radio, the {{national}} state-owned radio broadcaster, airs several AM {{radio stations in}} the city. Kolkata has 12 local radio stations broadcasting on FM, including two from AIR. India's state-owned television broadcaster, Doordarshan, provides two free-to-air terrestrial channels, while a mix of Bengali, Hindi, English, and other regional channels are accessible via cable subscription, direct-broadcast <b>satellite</b> <b>services,</b> or internet-based television.

KSAT is not tied to a particular operator of satellites and the antennas communicate with multiple satellites, thus reducing costs compared to dedicated ground stations. For a typical satellite, data is delivered to the end customer no more than thirty minutes after downloading.|$|E

Cablevision's board proceeded to shut the Voom <b>satellite</b> <b>service</b> down: The <b>satellite</b> <b>service</b> ceased on April 30, 2005, and Rainbow-1 and VOOM's spectrum allocations were sold to EchoStar.|$|R
5|$|SvalSat {{is owned}} and {{operated}} by Kongsberg <b>Satellite</b> <b>Services</b> (KSAT), which is again equally owned by the Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace and the Norwegian Space Centre, the latter which is again owned by the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Of KSAT's 120 employees, 22 are stationed in Longyearbyen and work at SvalSat. KSAT is not tied to a particular operator of satellites and some of the antennas communicate with multiple satellites, thus reducing costs compared to dedicated ground stations. For a typical satellite, data is delivered to the end customer no more than 30 minutes after downloading.|$|E
5|$|Television {{broadcasting}} in Hyderabad {{began in}} 1974 with {{the launch of}} Doordarshan, the Government of India's public service broadcaster, which transmits two free-to-air terrestrial television channels and one satellite channel. Private satellite channels started in July 1992 with the launch of Star TV. Satellite TV channels are accessible via cable subscription, direct-broadcast <b>satellite</b> <b>services</b> or internet-based television. Hyderabad's first dial-up internet access became available in the early 1990s and was limited to software development companies. The first public internet access service began in 1995, with the first private sector internet service provider (ISP) starting operations in 1998. In 2015, high-speed public WiFi was introduced {{in parts of the}} city.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the runway itself required the filling of crevasses {{and the removal of}} stones. Troll Airfield was opened on 11 February 2005 by Queen Sonja of Norway and the new research station the following day. After the opening, another power station was built in 2005. In 2006, a satellite base station was built by Kongsberg <b>Satellite</b> <b>Services.</b> This resulted in the need for a broadband connection for the base. During the winter season of 2006, there was no overwintering due to lack of funding, but from 2007 this has been re-instated. In 2008, a windmill was taken into use to provide some of the power.|$|E
40|$|Extravehicular {{mobility}} unit (EMU) {{factors associated}} with <b>satellite</b> <b>servicing</b> activities are identified and the EMU improvements necessary to enhance <b>satellite</b> <b>servicing</b> operations are outlined. Areas of EMU capabilities, equipment and structural interfaces, time lines, EMU modifications for <b>satellite</b> <b>servicing,</b> environmental hazards, and crew training are vital to manned Eva/satellite services and as such are detailed. Evaluation of EMU capabilities indicates that the EMU {{can be used in}} performing near term, basic <b>satellite</b> <b>servicing</b> tasks; however, <b>satellite</b> <b>servicing</b> is greatly enhanced by incorporating key modifications into the EMU. The servicing missions involved in contamination sensitive payload repair are illustrated. EVA procedures and equipment can be standardized, reducing both crew training time and in orbit operations time. By standardizing and coordinating procedures, mission cumulative time lines fall well within the EMU capability...|$|R

The scope of Phase 1 included TDM definition, outlining of servicing objectives, derivation of initial Space Station servicing support requirements, and generation of the associated programmatic schedules and cost. The purpose of phase 2 of the <b>satellite</b> <b>servicing</b> study was to expand and refine the overall understanding of how best to use the manned space station as a test bed for demonstration of <b>satellite</b> <b>servicing</b> capabilities...|$|R

5|$|After Rolf Skår was {{appointed}} director of NSC, plans were launched {{to try to}} win the ground station contract for NASA's planned Earth Observing System (EOS). NASA was considering locating the ground station in Greenland, at McMurdo Station in Antarctica or at Esrange in Sweden. Skår invited a NASA delegation to visit Svalbard, and from 1996 NSC and NASA started negotiating a contract to establish a ground station at Longyearbyen. The first satellite to use SvalSat was Landsat 7, which was launched on 15 April 1999. NSC bought SSC's ownership in TSS and Lockheed Martin's ownership in SvalSat in 2001. On 1 February 2002, NSC and Kongsberg Spacetec merged their interests in satellite technology and operations into Kongsberg Satellite Station, which became the sole owner of both SvalSat and TSS. Legally, Kongsberg <b>Satellite</b> <b>Services</b> is a continuation of the operating company of TSS. KSAT opened Troll Satellite Station in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong had two {{licensed}} terrestrial broadcasters – ATV and TVB, {{the former}} {{of which has}} now been defunct. There are three local {{and a number of}} foreign suppliers of cable and <b>satellite</b> <b>services.</b> The production of Hong Kong's soap dramas, comedy series, and variety shows reach audiences throughout the Cantonese-speaking population. Magazine and newspaper publishers in Hong Kong distribute and print in both Chinese and English, with a focus on sensationalism and celebrity gossip. The media in Hong Kong is relatively free from official interference compared to Mainland China, although the Far Eastern Economic Review pointed to signs of self-censorship by media whose owners have close ties to or business interests in the People's Republic of China and states that even Western media outlets are not immune to growing Chinese economic power.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard Satellite Station {{was built}} because of Longyearbyen's {{excellent}} location to download data from satellites in polar orbit. Located at Platåberget above Hotellneset, {{it was built}} as a cooperation between NASA and the Norwegian Space Centre, but has since 2001 been operated by Kongsberg <b>Satellite</b> <b>Services.</b> EISCAT operates an incoherent scatter radar to study the northern lights. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, administered by the Global Crop Diversity Trust, is a secure underground facility capable of storing millions of crop seeds. The facility {{has been designed to}} protect against natural and human disasters, including global warming, floods and fires and nuclear holocaust. The site was chosen for a number of factors including its remoteness, sound geology and the ambient temperature of the permafrost.|$|E
