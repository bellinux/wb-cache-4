A problem also encountered in fossil feed pump applications using similar electrically low conductive feed water, referred to as Combined Water Treated (CWT) feed water operation. After a short number of operating hours, rotating <b>seal</b> <b>faces</b> made from various kinds of silicon- or tungsten carbide materials show severe forms of edge chipping and crater type damages, while the opposing carbon graphite <b>seal</b> <b>faces,</b> may display a significant loss of <b>seal</b> <b>face</b> binder material, which inevitably results {{in the formation of}} uncontrolled radial flow channels across the <b>seal</b> <b>face</b> gap.

40|$|The static metal sealing {{mechanism}} {{is essential for}} the structural design of subsea pipeline mechanical connector. By analyzing the {{sealing mechanism}} and contact pressure on <b>sealing</b> <b>face,</b> the critical condition of the seal is obtained. Based on the superposition theorem of elasticity, the formula of critical mean contact pressure ensuring seal is deduced. The finite element analysis result of critical mean contact pressure agrees with the analysis result very well and the critical mean contact pressure decreases with the increase in pipeline wall thickness and sealing width; however, the radius of pipeline has less influence on it. The critical mean contact pressure of 8 -in subsea pipeline mechanical connector is 223. 34 [*]MPa and subsea pipeline mechanical connector is designed with ANSYS. The internal pressure experiments indicate that the sealing performance of final designed subsea pipeline mechanical connectors is higher than the design pressure of 4. 5 [*]MPa and all the initial designed ones cannot seal up to 4. 5 [*]MPa. By observing the sealing indentation on pipeline surface, when the mean contact pressure is higher than the critical mean contact pressure and the contact pressure variance is smaller, a full contact is seen to form a seal.

40|$|Reliable {{performances}} of high temperature and high pressure operating steam {{pressure relief valves}} (HTHP PRVs) are extremely important {{for the safety of}} nuclear power plants. It is still a challenge to accurately describe the dynamic performance of HTHP PRVs. In this study, the accuracy of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based modelling of the transient processes is examined. For one of the HTHP PRVs named DWPRV, the effects of different parameters on the dynamic performance were investigated by combining CFD simulation and experiments. In the simulation, the domain decomposition method (DDM) and the Grid Pre-deformation Method (GPM) were adopted to handle the moving disk geometry and the large mesh deformation. The effect of damping was also studied. It is confirmed that the use of CFD simulation can improve the design and settings of a HTHP PRV in a highly energetic service that is difficult to test due to safety reasons. For the DWPRV, {{it was found that the}} maximum flow rate occurs when the curtain area is 1. 18 times the throat area. The degree of superheat ranging from 0 C to 100 C has a negligible effect on the performance of DWPRV regardless of the changes in the material mechanical properties with operating temperatures.

40|$|In {{a nuclear}} power plant, {{one of the most}} {{important}} systems for both safety and performance is the reactor cooling system. The cooling system is generally driven by one or more very large centrifugal pumps. Most reactor coolant pumps utilize a multi-stage mechanical face seal system for fluid containment. As a result, these seal systems are critical to safe, continued operation of a nuclear reactor. Without adequate sealing, loss of coolant volume can occur, and a reactor may be forced to shut down, costing the operating utility significantly until it can be brought online again. The main advantage of mechanical face seals is their self-adjusting properties. These seals are tuned so that they automatically adjust to varying fluid conditions to provide adequate leakage control. Because of the enormous pressures, complicated water chemistry, and possible large temperature transients, the mechanical seals inside a reactor coolant pump must be some of the most robust seals available. In addition, their long service life and continuous operation demand durability and the capability to adjust to a wide range of conditions. However, over time, wear, chemical deposition, or changing operating conditions can alter the face gap, which is the critical geometry between the sealing faces of a seal. An altered face gap can lead to undesirable conditions of too much or not enough leakage, which must be maintained within a certain range to provide lubrication and cooling to the seal faces without resulting in uncontrolled coolant volume loss. Nuclear power plants operate within strict leakage ranges, and long-term effects causing undesirable leakage can eventually necessitate a reactor shutdown if the seal cannot self-adjust to control the leakage. This document will examine possible causes of undesirable leakage rates in a commonly-used reactor coolant pump assembly. These causes will be examined to determine the conditions which promote them, the physical explanation for their effect on the operation of a mechanical seal, and possible methods of mitigation of both the cause and its effect. These findings are based on previous publications by utilities and technical and incident reports from reactor stations which detail actual incidents of abnormal seal performance and their root causes as determined by the utilities. Next, a method of increasing the ability of a mechanical seal to adapt to a wider range of conditions will be proposed. This method involves modifying an existing seal face to include a method of active control. This active control focuses on deliberately deforming one face of the mechanical <b>sealing</b> <b>face</b> pair. This deformation alters the face gap in order to make the fluid conditions inside the face gap more preferable, generating more or less leakage as desired. Two methods of actuation, hydraulic pressure and piezoelectric deformation, will be proposed. Finally, a model of the actively controlled seal faces will be introduced. This model includes a method of numerically solving the Reynolds equation to determine the fluid mechanics that drive the lubrication problem in the seal face and coupling the solution with a deformation analysis in a finite element model of a seal face. The model solves iteratively until a converged solution of a sealed pressure distribution, a resulting face deformation, and a calculated leakage rate is reached. The model includes a study of the effects of induced deformation in the seal via both hydraulic and piezoelectric actuation and the ability of this deformation to control the leakage rate.

40|$|A {{reduction}} of vibrations in mechanical seals increases {{the life of}} the seals in centrifugal pumps by minimizing fatigue damage. Mechanical seals consist of two smooth <b>seal</b> <b>faces.</b> one face is stationary with respect to the pump. The other rotates. Between the faces a fluid film evaporates as the fluid moves radially outward across the <b>seal</b> <b>face.</b> ideally, the film evaporates as it reaches the outer surface of the <b>seal</b> <b>faces,</b> thereby preventing leakage from the pump and effectively lubricating the two surfaces. Relative vibrations between the two surfaces affect the fluid film and lead to stresses on the <b>seal</b> <b>faces,</b> which lead to fatigue damage. As the fluid film breaks down impacts between the two <b>seal</b> <b>faces</b> create tensile stresses on the faces, which cycle at the speed of the motor rotation.
