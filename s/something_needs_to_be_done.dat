5|$|On an {{ordinary}} day, a brown bear strolls {{onto the streets}} of Springfield, frightening the town. The bear is eventually subdued by the police. Homer convinces Springfield that <b>something</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> {{to protect them from}} bears, and the town takes their complaint to Mayor Quimby, who gives in easily. Soon, the Bear Patrol is created. Homer is then shocked to see taxes have been raised five dollars to maintain the patrol, and this warrants another visit by the town to the Mayor's office. To appease them, Mayor Quimby blames the high taxes on illegal immigrants. He creates Proposition 24, which will require all illegal immigrants in Springfield to be deported.|$|E
500|$|Marc Buxton at Den of Geek {{scored the}} episode 3.5 out of 5, calling the Age of Ultron tie-in [...] "anti-climactic ... {{it felt like}} a bit of a cheat", criticizing what he saw as too much of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s own storyline being left for the film to resolve, but said that [...] "all in all, it was a rather good episode". Buxton said that Skye [...] "really shined this episode", and called her {{one-shot}} fight [...] "worthy of a rewind or two", while highlighting [...] "one of the biggest character moments" [...] in the episode with Simmons' decision to kill Ward. Rob Leane, also at Den of Geek, was more positive of the Age of Ultron tie-in, calling it [...] "the next best allusion to the movies we’ve ever had" [...] following the series' connections to Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and praising the use of List and Hill. He positively compared Skye's one-shot fight sequence to the well known single-take sequences in The Avengers and Daredevil, calling it [...] "the very welcome TV equivalent" [...] of the [...] "air-punching fan-pleasing moments" [...] often found in Marvel's films. Leane also compared Coulson's [...] "real mission-within-a-mission" [...] reveal to a similar moment in The Winter Soldier, and summarized [...] "The Dirty Half Dozen" [...] as [...] "a thoroughly entertaining episode, thanks in equal part to the tie-in stuff, some solid action and several strong character moments. Ward’s return was handled well, too, although <b>something</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> about Simmons’ growing unlikeable-ness." ...|$|E

While miners' representative Zolisa Bodlani said of the deal that [...] "it's a huge achievement.

50|$|By {{implementing}} {{the notion that}} <b>something</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> political leaders influence scientists.

With these aspects bestowed upon a person, competition to succeed before someone else has, more often than not, proven to be the answer. This relieves stress and makes both the person doing the work and the government, who now has what they wanted, happy… a cruel psychological mind game played by the government.|$|E

The game is mostly started out by one person that acknowledges <b>something</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> and shouts out 'without X' ('zonder X') where X stands for the thing that needs to be done. This way the person making the roof claims to go without doing X, and so the last person to make the roof is the one that has to perform the task.|$|E
