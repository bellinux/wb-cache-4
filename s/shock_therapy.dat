Extracorporeal <b>shock</b> wave <b>therapy</b> is effective in numerous types of tendinopathies. Hypothesis: <b>Shock</b> wave <b>therapy</b> is an effective treatment for chronic greater trochanteric pain syndrome. Study Design: Case control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Thirty-three patients with chronic greater trochanteric pain syndrome received low-energy <b>shock</b> wave <b>therapy</b> (2000 shocks; 4 bars of pressure, equal to 0. 18 mJ/mm 2; total energy flux density, 360 mJ/mm 2). Thirty-three patients with chronic greater trochanteric pain syndrome were not treated with <b>shock</b> wave <b>therapy</b> but received additional forms of nonoperative <b>therapy</b> (control). All <b>shock</b> wave <b>therapy</b> procedures were performed without anesthesia. Evaluation was by change in visual analog score, Harris hip score, and Roles and Maudsley score.

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{considerable}} controversy regarding {{the effectiveness of}} extracorporeal <b>shock</b> wave <b>therapy</b> {{in the management of}} plantar heel pain. Our aim was to conduct a systematic review of randomised controlled trials to investigate the effectiveness of extracorporeal <b>shock</b> wave <b>therapy</b> and to produce a precise estimate of the likely benefits of this therapy. Methods We conducted a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) identified from the Cochrane Controlled trials register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL from 1966 until September 2004. We included randomised trials which evaluated extracorporeal <b>shock</b> wave <b>therapy</b> used to treat plantar heel pain. Trials comparing extra corporeal <b>shock</b> wave <b>therapy</b> with placebo or different doses of extra corporeal <b>shock</b> wave <b>therapy</b> were considered for inclusion in the review. We independently applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to each identified randomised controlled trial, extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of each trial. Results Six RCTs (n = 897) permitted a pooled estimate of effectiveness based on pain scores collected using 10 cm visual analogue scales for morning pain. The estimated weighted mean difference was 0. 42 (95 % confidence interval 0. 02 to 0. 83) representing less than 0. 5 cm on a visual analogue scale. There was no evidence of heterogeneity and a fixed effects model was used. Conclusion A meta-analysis of data from six randomised-controlled trials that included a total of 897 patients was statistically significant in favour of extracorporeal <b>shock</b> wave <b>therapy</b> for the treatment of plantar heel pain but the effect size was very small. A sensitivity analysis including only high quality trials did not detect a statistically significant effect. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: There are no {{controlled}} studies {{testing the}} efficacy of various nonoperative strategies for treatment of greater trochanter pain syndrome. Hypothesis The null hypothesis was that local corticosteroid injection, home training, and repetitive low-energy <b>shock</b> wave <b>therapy</b> produce equivalent outcomes 4 months from baseline. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Two hundred twenty-nine patients with refractory unilateral greater trochanter pain syndrome were assigned sequentially to a home training program, a single local corticosteroid injection (25 mg prednisolone), or a repetitive low-energy radial shock wave treatment. Subjects underwent outcome assessments at baseline and at 1, 4, and 15 months. Primary outcome measures were degree of recovery, measured on a 6 -point Likert scale (subjects with rating completely recovered or much improved were rated as treatment success), and severity of pain {{over the past week}} (0 - 10 points) at 4 -month follow-up. RESULTS: One month from baseline, results after corticosteroid injection (success rate, 75 %; pain rating, 2. 2 points) were significantly better than those after home training (7 %; 5. 9 points) or <b>shock</b> wave <b>therapy</b> (13 %; 5. 6 points). Regarding treatment success at 4 months, radial <b>shock</b> wave <b>therapy</b> led to significantly better results (68 %; 3. 1 points) than did home training (41 %; 5. 2 points) and corticosteroid injection (51 %; 4. 5 points). The null hypothesis was rejected. Fifteen months from baseline, radial <b>shock</b> wave <b>therapy</b> (74 %; 2. 4 points) and home training (80 %; 2. 7 points) were significantly more successful than was corticosteroid injection (48 %; 5. 3 points). CONCLUSION: The role of corticosteroid injection for greater trochanter pain syndrome needs to be reconsidered. Subjects should be properly informed about {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the treatment options, including the economic burden. The significant short-term superiority of a single corticosteroid injection over home training and <b>shock</b> wave <b>therapy</b> declined after 1 month. Both corticosteroid injection and home training were significantly less successful than was <b>shock</b> wave <b>therapy</b> at 4 -month follow-up.

25|$|A {{series of}} radical {{physical}} therapies {{were developed in}} central and continental Europe in the late 1910s, the 1920s and most particularly, the 1930s. Among these we may note the Austrian psychiatrist Julius Wagner-Jauregg's malarial therapy for general paresis of the insane (or neurosyphilis) first used in 1917, and for which he won a Nobel Prize in 1927. This treatment heralded {{the beginning of a}} radical and experimental era in psychiatric medicine that increasingly broke with an asylum-based culture of therapeutic nihilism in the treatment of chronic psychiatric disorders, most particularly dementia praecox (increasingly known as schizophrenia from the 1910s, although the two terms were used more or less interchangeably until at least the end of the 1930s), which were typically regarded as hereditary degenerative disorders and therefore unamenable to any therapeutic intervention. Malarial therapy was followed in 1920 by barbiturate induced deep sleep therapy to treat dementia praecox, which was popularised by the Swiss psychiatrist Jakob Klaesi. In 1933 the Vienna-based psychiatrist Manfred Sakel introduced insulin <b>shock</b> <b>therapy</b> and in August 1934 Ladislas J. Meduna, a Hungarian neuropathologist and psychiatrist working in Budapest, introduced cardiazol <b>shock</b> <b>therapy</b> (cardiazol is the tradename of the chemical compound pentylenetetrazol, known by the tradename metrazol in the United States), which was the first convulsive or seizure therapy for a psychiatric disorder. Again, both of these therapies were initially targeted at curing dementia praecox. Cardiazol <b>shock</b> <b>therapy,</b> founded on the theoretical notion that there existed a biological antagonism between schizophrenia and epilepsy and that therefore inducing epiletiform fits in schizophrenic patients might effect a cure, was superseded by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), invented by the Italian neurologist Ugo Cerletti in 1938.|$|E
