In such an eventuality, earthquake insurance is expected to {{play a part in}} ex-post recovery efforts from the damage caused by these earthquakes, with the Japanese government developing <b>special</b> <b>support</b> <b>programs.</b> The previously low penetration rate of earthquake insurance in Japan, however, meant that it did not {{play a significant role in}} recovery efforts following the 1995 Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake. Despite recent progress in improving the system and an increasing awareness of the risks from earthquakes, the penetration rate of earthquake insurance in Japan remains at approximately 20 %.

Seventy-two current students and graduates of the program since its inception twenty years ago completed a survey about their experiences, highlights, challenges, and use of communication tools and support services at university. Findings indicated that, {{while many of the}} students used the services provided by the university's Deaf Students' Support Program, other deaf and hard of hearing students did not use these services. There were some differences in outcomes between the two groups. The study results reflect, both quantitatively and qualitatively, students' levels of satisfaction with the services they received.

30|$|On the {{question}} why do individuals select {{to work in}} agriculture, we find evidence suggesting that schooling and total household wage income reduce the probability of being employed in agriculture significantly (by 3.4 and 0.1  %, respectively). The differences in the magnitude for each of those variables are not large. The time dummies are included to show the effect of severe political closures on employment in agriculture; the 2006 dummy shows that for rural areas, the probability of selecting into agriculture increased and was significant and, for non-rural areas, it was not significant. This supports the view that more people turn to agriculture for employment when other market opportunities disappear. This confirms the employment consequences on rural and non-rural areas. Closures have a more serious impact on wages and unemployment for rural areas, thus giving agriculture <b>special</b> <b>support</b> and/or <b>programs</b> {{is important for the}} rural population. 22 We also find that if the household head is employed in agriculture, the likelihood of selecting the agricultural sector increases dramatically.

The massive increase of the number of immigrant populations in the USA in the last few decades – especially after the Immigration Act of 1965 – has brought about great changes in the demographic realities of the country, affecting, alongside other spheres of life, education first of all, and giving rise to all kinds of myths that have had to be gradually demolished. Among the demographic myths (Cummins et al. 1999 : 1 - 7), # 1 states that “the number of students who don’t speak English is going down”. On the contrary, it has been proved that “Language minority students, including limited-English proficient (LEP) students, are the fastest growing group of students in the United States today”.
