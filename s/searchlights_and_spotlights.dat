2500|$|In {{addition}} to lasers, other bright directional lights such as <b>searchlights</b> <b>and</b> <b>spotlights</b> {{can have the}} same dazzling, distracting, and flashblinding effects.

5000|$|Parabolic reflectors {{are used}} to collect energy from a distant source (for example sound waves or {{incoming}} star light). Since the principles of reflection are reversible, parabolic reflectors {{can also be used}} to focus radiation from an isotropic source into a narrow beam. [...] In optics, parabolic mirrors {{are used to}} gather light in reflecting telescopes and solar furnaces, and project a beam of light in flashlights, <b>searchlights,</b> stage <b>spotlights,</b> <b>and</b> car headlights. In radio, parabolic antennas are used to radiate a narrow beam of radio waves for point-to-point communications in satellite dishes and microwave relay stations, and to locate aircraft, ships, and vehicles in radar sets. In acoustics, parabolic microphones are used to record faraway sounds such as bird calls, in sports reporting, and to eavesdrop on private conversations in espionage and law enforcement.|$|R
