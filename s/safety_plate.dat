FHWA Publication IF- 09 - 014 provides state DOTs with important guidance for gusset plate evaluation but the methods are unnecessarily complex, requiring the use of point-in-time demands which are cumbersome to calculate, and do not investigate the likelihood of plate yielding under service loads, which may compromise <b>plate</b> <b>safety.</b> With support from WSDOT and FHWA, the PI’s are developing a simpler and consistent evaluation method using finite element analyses (FEAs).

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Gusset plate {{connections}} {{are commonly used}} to join members in steel truss bridges. Most gusset plate connections were designed to provide sufficient thickness to resist tensile and shear forces as well as compression buckling based on simple approximations. The 2007 collapse of the I- 35 W Bridge in Minnesota necessitated the safety assessment of gusset plates and prompted several studies of gusset plate behavior. The complex geometry and various loading profiles {{make it difficult to}} analyze and estimate maximum stress in gusset plates and its capacity. This research focuses on numerical simulation of steel truss bridge gusset plate connections. A simple but accurate finite element modeling methodology was developed to efficiently simulate gusset plate connection subassemblages. A rapid procedure for assessing gusset <b>plate</b> <b>safety,</b> namely Triage Evaluation Procedure (TEP), was developed to predict the onset of gusset plate yielding. This procedure considers the worst-case scenario for the interaction of stresses generated by connected truss members and conservatively identifies at risk gusset plates. A Refined Evaluation Procedure (REP) was then developed to predict stress distributions at critical sections using simple and idealized approximate stress distribution models. By using these stress distribution models at the critical sections, the location and magnitude of the maximum stress in the gusset plate connections can be estimated. The TEP and REP are two-step evaluation procedures to provide fast and accurate estimate for gusset plate yield capacity. In addition to the gusset plates, rivet shear resistance needs to be considered to evaluate the overall <b>safety</b> of gusset <b>plate</b> connections. Rivet shear strength, rivet ductility, connected member yielding, and the effect of connection length were identified as factors which affect joint strength. The current AASHTO bridge evaluation code does not consider all four factors and yields an overly-conservative estimate of joint shear resistance. A revised equation which considers ``Strong'' and ``Weak" connected elements and produces a more reasonable estimate of joint shear resistance is recommended...|$|R
50|$|The third use came in 2000. Following fatal crashes of Adam Petty and Kenny Irwin, Jr. at the New Hampshire International Speedway {{during the}} May Busch Series and July Winston Cup Series races, respectively, NASCAR adopted a one-inch (2.54 cm) {{restrictor}} plate {{to slow the}} cars headed towards the tight turns {{as part of a}} series of reforms to alleviate stuck throttle problems which were alleged to have caused both fatal crashes. For the Winston Cup race, it was used just once at the 2000 Dura Lube 300. Jeff Burton led all 300 laps in the ensuing race, despite a 23-car two-abreast battle in the first ten laps, a dramatic charge past 22 cars in 100 laps by John Andretti (who finished seventh), and two charges by Bobby Labonte in the final 50 laps where he took the lead but Burton beat him back to the stripe. The use of restrictor plates, intended as an emergency measure pending a more permanent replacement in any event, was discontinued at New Hampshire for the following race for Cup only. However, the Modifieds still use a restrictor plate because the speeds are too great for that class of racecar without them. The track has since been changed with soft walls to improve racing <b>safety.</b> Restrictor <b>plates</b> remain a permanent fixture to the Modifieds and the racing has often broken 20 official lead changes for 100-125 laps of competition.|$|R
50|$|Emission test (front <b>plate)</b> and vehicle <b>safety</b> test (rear <b>plate)</b> {{stickers}} {{were also}} {{attached to the}} plate before 2010, in which year the emission sticker became obsolete as the emission test was incorporated into the safety test and was not performed separately any more. The expiration date can be figured out as follows: The year is in {{the centre of the}} sticker, and the stickers are attached with the month of expiration pointing upwards. The black marking on the side (near the 12) thus makes it easy for the police to see the expiration month from a distance. Like a clock, the marking shows the same position of a number on the face of a clock. For example, the black marking is on the left side, so it is the ninth month (or 9 o'clock) and hence the expiry date is 30 September.

The aim {{of this study was to}} establish the effectiveness and <b>safety</b> of biodegradable <b>plates</b> and screws as potential alternatives to metallic ones. This multi-center randomized controlled trial was conducted from December 2006 to July 2009. Included were patients who underwent mandibular and/or Le Fort I osteotomies and those with fractures of the mandible, maxilla, and zygoma. The patients were assigned to a titanium control group (KLS Martin) or to a biodegradable test group (Inion CPS). The primary outcome measure was 'bone healing 8 weeks post-operatively'. The Intention-To-Treat (ITT) analysis of 113 patients in the titanium group and 117 patients in the biodegradable group yielded a significant difference (p < 0. 001), primarily because in 25 patients (21 %) who were randomized to the biodegradable group, the surgeon made the decision to switch to titanium intra-operatively. Despite this 'inferior' primary outcome result, biodegradable plates and screws could be safely used when it was possible to apply them. The benefits of using biodegradable systems (fewer plate removal operations) should be confirmed during a follow-up of minimally 5 years (Controlled-trials. com ISRCTN number 44212338) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the <b>safety</b> of bioabsorbable <b>plates</b> and screws in humans. Methods: For this purpose, an implant system based on [poly(lactic-co-glycolic acids) (85 : 15) ] was designed. The system was tested for pH, temperature, and swelling and then its surface morphology was analyzed for surface porosity using environmental electron microscopy. Then, the effects of this bioabsorbable system on the viability and profileration of osteocytes were examined on a molecular level via in vitro experiments. A [poly(lactic-co-glycolic acids) (90 : 10) ] bioabsorbable implant, which is commercially available and used in orthopedic surgery, was used as control group. For the statistical evaluation of the data obtained in the present study, the groups were compared by Tukey HSD test following ANOVA. The significance level was set as p < 0. 05. Results: It was observed that the osteocytes cultivated on the PLGA system designed in the present study included more live cells and allowed more proliferation compared to the control. Conclusion: One of the criteria in the selection of implants for orthopedic surgery is that a good implant should not need removal and thus a second surgery. In the present study, a bioabsorbable implant was designed considering this criterion. The present study is the first step to prove the safety of this new design by in vitro toxicity and viability experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} of seed osmoconditioning, {{which consists of}} a controlled hydration and dehydration, was evaluated for use in foodstuff production;In the first experiment, soybean, wheat, mungbean, and sesame seeds were hydrated in polyethylene glycol (PEG), chitosan plus water (CH), citric acid (CA), and water (W). Hydrated seeds were either dehydrated to their original moisture content or left fully-hydrated and stored at 5 °C or 15 °C for 2 or 4 weeks. Fully-hydrated and dehydrated seeds sprouted faster than untreated seeds, but the performance of fully-hydrated seeds declined during storage. Phytate content in soybean and mungbean seeds increased with the initial hydration. Phytate decreased when seeds were dehydrated, but phytate content in fully-hydrated seeds remained high. To assess microbiological <b>safety,</b> aerobic <b>plate</b> counts, total coliform counts, and yeast and mold counts were performed. Dehydrated seeds had lower microbial counts than fully-hydrated seeds. Polyethylene glycol and citric acid had an antimicrobial effect;In the second experiment, soybean and wheat seeds were surface-sterilized with NaOCl, EtOH, or a control. Seeds were hydrated in PEG, CA, or W. Following hydration, seeds were treated with calcium propionate or a control, and then dehydrated. The crops were analyzed as dry, unsprouted seeds and as 48 -hour sprouts. Citric acid and NaOCl had antimicrobial impacts on unsprouted seeds, but sprouted seeds had microbial counts up to 10 [superscript] 5 higher than unsprouted seeds regardless of treatment. The calcium propionate treatment reduced total coliform counts in wheat {{by a factor of}} 10. Some counts declined after 16 weeks of 4 °C storage. Sprouting resulted in increased phytate in soybeans (40 %) and wheat (10 %). Sprouts from osmoconditioned and untreated seeds were rated similarly in sensory analyses;In the final experiment, phytate content and phytase activity of soybean and wheat seeds were determined during the osmoconditioning process and during a subsequent 144 - 192 hour sprouting period. While phytate content in wheat seeds and sprouts did not change during osmoconditioning or sprouting, phytase activity increased throughout the sprouting period. Phytate in soybean seeds increased at 8 hours of sprouting, and decreased at 192 hours. The reduced content at 192 hours coincided with an increase in phytase activity. Osmoconditioned and untreated sprouts did not differ with regard to phytate content or phytase activity...|$|R
40|$|Steel {{plates are}} widely used {{in a variety of}} civil {{engineering}} applications for load bearing structural components, due to their favourable strength to weight ratio. Many of these plates have openings that are commonly used for reducing weight, access for utilities or for inspection in shipping and offshore installations. However the influence of these openings to the structural component’s robustness and resilience against blast loading is relatively unknown, with limited research conducted in this subject to date. Due to the high costs associated with offshore facilities they are typically very congested. This coupled with the producing, processing, storing and transporting of hydrocarbon materials means that explosions and subsequent fires are major hazards with severe consequences. In the event of an explosion, the blast load will initially impact the secondary structure (large spanning plated sections) and then transfer through to the primary structure, highlighting their critical consideration in <b>safety</b> assessments. <b>Plated</b> structures are also known to cause confinement, which in turn will results in higher overpressures, making the consequences of an event more severe. The aim of this research was to investigate the combined influence that openings have on the overpressure and the structural response of thin ductile plates subjected to extreme dynamic transverse loads. This was achieved by conducting a set of well-defined experiments investigating the response of 1 / 8 scale (0. 5 m square) mild steel plates with openings subjected to pulse pressure loading. Six central (scaled) openings were considered; circular (50, 75 and 100 mm) and extended circular (50 by 75, 75 by 100 and 100 by 125 mm) representative of typical offshore and shipping applications. Each plate design was assessed with two boundary conditions (restrained and non-restrained) and two nominal loading conditions. The boundary conditions adopted in this study allowed the response to be bounded, and enabled them to be practicably modelled in FEA-analyses and in the simplified analytical approaches. A pulse pressure test facility was used to generate nominal pulse pressure loads (25 and 50 psi) applied over a time (100 to 200 + ms load duration) representative of extreme explosion loading conditions offshore. All plates exhibited a mode I type failure (large inelastic deformation) highlighting the large reserve strength in such members. The work has shown that the inclusion of an opening...|$|R
