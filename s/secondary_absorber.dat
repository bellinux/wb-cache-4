40|$|AbstractNew {{solar energy}} systems with fixed {{concentrators}} {{have been designed}} to be integrated to buildings and adapt heat and electricity demand. The proposed systems are associated with less tracking requirements and the use of thermal, PV or hybrid PV/T absorbers. In some cases, an additional absorber can receive the diffuse radiation as well as the direct sunlight that is not captured by the main absorber. The simplest design mode of these systems is the flat absorber with flat reflector, which is static or movable to track solar radiation. A second design is the static parabolic or CPC reflector and a third one the Fresnel lens. These concentrators are combined with a primary linear absorber and tracking the converged beam solar radiation. The non-absorbed diffuse radiation and out of focus solar radiation is absorbed by a flat absorber, working as <b>secondary</b> <b>absorber,</b> so that the system to absorb almost all incident solar radiation. Thermal absorbers or photovoltaic strips can be mainly used as primary receivers, while for the concentrators, specular or diffuse reflectors can be applied in mirror type systems and linear Fresnel lenses in lens type systems.

40|$|Metamaterials {{were first}} {{introduced}} {{for dealing with}} electromagnetic waves. By creating a material with negative magnetic permeability and electric permittivity, {{it is possible to}} manufacture perfect optical lenses, electromagnetic absorbers, technologies for rendering objects invisible and so on. Later researchers began to look into metamaterials for dealing with acoustic waves. This thesis presents the modeling and analysis techniques for design of metamaterial beams as elastic wave absorbers. An acoustic metamaterial beam is designed by attaching tiny subsystems to an isotropic beam at separate locations. Each unit cell consists of a beam segment and a mass-spring-damper subsystem so that it could be modeled as a discrete system of two degrees of freedom. By integration, the idealized model becomes a dispersive medium with a frequency stopband. The work shows that the metamaterial beam uses the local resonance of subsystems to generate inertia forces to work against the external load and prevent elastic waves from propagating forward. Dispersion analysis and frequency response analysis are conducted to find the stopband of a metamaterial beam. Moreover, the working mechanisms of the metamaterial beam, the concept of negative effective mass, and acoustic and optical modes are presented. This concept is also extended to design a multi-frequency vibration absorber that works for absorbing broadband elastic waves. Numerical simulations by using finite elements validate the design and reveal a set of optimized parameter values. This work shows that, for a multi-frequency vibration absorber, a high damping ratio for the <b>secondary</b> <b>absorber</b> combines two stopbands into a broad one while a low damping ratio for the primary absorber guarantees quick response to the coming excitation elastic wave...|$|E

As the salt melts at about 210 degrees C it can be {{suitable}} as a heat storage for cooking applications. A solar salt container to be illuminated directly by the sun rays in should be heated from the top. One way of achieving this is to position the storage below a primary parabolic dish, this having a center hole to allow the rays from a secondary reflector to hit the top plate of the storage. A double reflector system becomes more sensitive to surface imperfections and to the solar tracking accuracy. A 2 m diameter parabolic dish with a secondary 0. 2 m diameter reflector has been considered as a test system for direct illumination of a heat storage. The optical performance of the system is investigated by means of a ray tracer. The ray tracer is described and a sensitivity study is made with respect to solar tracking accuracy, the effect of mirror tiles instead of smooth surfaces, the positioning and size of the secondary reflector and the effect of illumination of a the top plate from the side (the top plate remaining horizontal during the daily sun movements). A focusing effect is obtained by slightly lifting the <b>secondary</b> <b>absorber</b> above the point of the common focus of the primary and the secondary. The primary reflector should be as smooth as possible, the secondary reflector is less sensitive and could be surfaced with 1 - 2 cm mirror tiles with acceptable performance. A 10 cm diameter absorber dish is the minimum size, a 20 cm dish is more tolerant for tracking accuracy and for low solar angles.

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} design procedures, the modeling techniques {{and the working}} mechanism of metamaterial structures for wide-band elastic wave absorption and structure vibration suppression. The metamaterial structures are designed by attaching discrete mass-spring subsystems to elastic homogeneous bars, beams or plates. Dispersion analysis is used to find the band gap for infinite metamaterial structures without damping. Frequency response analysis (FRA) and transient analysis are conducted for metamaterial structures with boundary conditions and damping. The work explains the concept of negative effective mass and spring constants as well as acoustic and optical modes. The work also shows that metamaterial structures are essentially based {{on the concept of}} conventional vibration absorbers. The local resonance between the subsystems and external excitation generates concentrated forces to resist the longitudinal deformation of bars and straighten the curvature of beams and plates so that the propagation of elastic waves can be prohibited. Numerical simulation shows that boundary conditions {{have a significant effect on}} the propagation of elastic waves especially in low-frequency band, band gap can be expanded by damping, and the damping in vibration absorber is much more efficient than modal damping in homogeneous structures. Besides, a multi-frequency acoustic metamaterial plate for broadband wave absorption is designed. The metamaterial plate is designed by attaching 2 -DOF (degree of freedom) mass-spring subsystems to an isotropic elastic plate as vibration absorbers. The work shows that two stopbands are created by the multi-frequency absorber and the stopbands can be expanded by increasing the absorbers' mass or reducing the edge length of the working unit. A high damping ratio for the <b>secondary</b> <b>absorbers</b> helps to combine the two stopbands into a broad one while a low damping ratio for the primary absorber still guarantee a quick response in transient period.

The energy lost by ionization is non negligible and the proton can be kicked out of the RF bucket. The material and thickness of the scraper have to be carefully adjusted according to the position of secondary collimators and momentum aperture of the machine. We derive simple analytical expressions for a generic case. The same calculations have been applied to the case of the SNS accumulator ring.

40|$|Longitudinal {{barriers}} {{are commonly used}} to shield hazards, including stiff bridge rail ends and slopes. In some locations, a secondary roadway intersects the primary roadway within the guardrail’s length-of-need (LON). Some intersections have as little as 15 ft (4. 6 m) between the intersection and beginning of the bridge railing, which require short-radius guardrail systems. No short-radius systems have been tested and approved to current impact safety standards for shielding hazards with these conditions. Site conditions provided by the Nebraska Department of Roads {{were used to determine}} the constraints for a new safety treatment for intersecting roadways and include intersection radii, bridge railing offset distances, and clear zone distances. An examination of the site conditions determined that the bridge railing end should be treated as a hazard, as defined in the Roadside Design Guide. The hazard would begin at the bridge railing end with a width extending to the clear zone. Several design concepts were developed to treat these situations with a preference on using existing technologies that could be adapted for this hazard scenario. Fifteen concepts were brainstormed with three considered for further analysis and evaluation. These concepts included net attenuation/end terminal, inertial barrel array/end terminal, and a bullnose with a <b>secondary</b> energy <b>absorber</b> inside of it.

Optimal conditions for enhancing the transfer of energy from the main (lower) to the secondary (upper) pendulum are sought. The damping is assumed to be of a linear viscous-type.

40|$|Parabolic troughs are {{the most}} used {{technology}} for solar thermal concentrators. These systems consist of a parabolic mirror which concentrates solar radiation onto a centrally located metallic tube which absorbs this radiation. A heat exchange fluid flowing inside the tube utilizes {{a part of this}} absorbed radiation and can reach temperatures in excess of 400 °C. A typical parabolic trough only concentrates solar radiation onto the lower side of the horizontally aligned absorber tube, which leads to an inhomogeneous flux distribution around the absorber circumference. This is an undesirable effect, as it will not only affect the heat exchange performance but will also introduce non-uniform thermal stresses within the absorber material. These stresses have been known to result in deflection of the absorber, which in turn negatively affects the amount of radiation the absorber is intercepting. The addition of a secondary reflector placed above the absorber provides a more spatially uniform flux distribution and allows for a reduction of the absorber diameter. In this work, absorber tube heat transfer is compared between a standard receiver with inhomogeneous flux distribution and one with a flat secondary reflector. Numerical modeling is used to analyze the heat transfer within the <b>absorber.</b> The novel <b>secondary</b> reflector employed allows for a 20 % reduction of the absorber tube external surface area. The influence of this parameter on the temperature distribution across the absorber&# 039;s surface is analyzed.

40|$|Solar {{irradiation}} {{is approximately}} 1 kW/m 2 {{on the surface}} of the Earth and utilising only 1 % of global solar resources could be enough to achieve the recommendations of international organisations to achieve a long-term climate stabilisation. Concentration of solar energy is a possible solution to overcome the low density disadvantage and to achieve a more efficient conversion to other types of energy such as electricity. Concentration is limited by the Sun-Earth geometry. The maximum limit of concentration for an ideal concentrator is established by the laws of thermodynamics for those concentrators which concentrate the Sun onto a point-like receiver (3 D concentrators). In the past, a simplification of this limit was conducted to calculate the limits of those concentrators which concentrate the Sun onto a linear receiver (2 D), and it was called the thermodynamics limit of 2 D receivers. This limit was not directly calculated as a product of thermodynamics laws but as a simplification of the 3 D case and in this work, it will be demonstrated how this limit was underestimated by 20 %. Solar concentrators have been designed in the past considering that no rays are to be missed in the receiver after being reflected (or refracted) in the primary concentrator. This assumption makes it possible to analyse concentrators by considering a cross-section along the symmetry plane of the systems. By applying the edge-ray theorem while maintaining the etendue of the solar bundle, the receiver size can be calculated for a given concentrator. Most of solar concentrators are based on parabolic reflectors and the assumption that no rays can miss the receiver further limits the maximum concentration achievable. This limitation depends on whether the parabolic concentrator is a dish (3 D) or a trough (2 D) and ranges between &frac 14; and &frac 12; the theoretical limits of concentration. In this work, an increase of concentration ratio is explored by sacrificing optical efficiency. If rays are missed in the absorber, concentrations up to the theoretical limits are found for parabolic concentrators by maintaining the simplification of the cross-section analysis. Further research demonstrates how this simplification, though practical for designing 100 % optical efficient concentrators and accurate if no rays are missed, is not accurate if rays are missing the target. Calculations of concentration for parabolic concentrators without cross-section simplifications conducted in this work lead to the conclusion that the thermodynamic limits of concentration are achievable for ideal 3 D parabolic concentrators while there can be a concentration surpass of a 20 % the previously stated as limit of concentration for 2 D systems. These new limits are reached with a reduction in optical efficiency and they would be not practical for real concentrators. However, it is demonstrated how concentration ratios around 80 % the previous theoretical limit can be achieved for parabolic troughs with cylindrical receivers while maintaining optical efficiencies above 70 % with concentrations close to the previous limit can be achieved with troughs and flat receivers maintaining optical efficiency above 80 %. Ray tracing simulations conducted to validate the theoretical development matched the results obtained in this thesis. The missed radiation can be redirected to the receivers by the addition of a second-stage optics. Previous works have addressed complicated geometries for the secondary optics, and concentration and thermal improvements have been achieved. However, due to the complicated geometries required, the large dimensions of the secondary mirrors or to a combination of both, the proposed secondary optics have not become a practical solution. In this thesis, a flat secondary reflector is proposed as an alternative to increase the concentration ratio while maintaining simplicity. A theoretical analysis to calculate the appropriate dimensions of a secondary flat reflector for a given primary mirror is developed in this thesis and ray tracing is conducted to validate the equations obtained. A flat reflector will have a minimal economic impact in the cost of a parabolic trough and it allows larger concentration ratios for identical primary mirror areas compared to a standard parabolic trough. Increases of concentration ratio up to 80 % are observed when a secondary flat reflector is inserted in a commercial system, while the shadow area introduced in the primary mirror is usually less than 15 % of the primary mirror area. The increase in pumping power is offset by the increase in system efficiency. The inclusion of the flat secondary reflector changes the trough tolerance to misalignments and the flux distribution along the receiver&# 039;s surface. Both effects are analysed with ray tracing simulations considering the flat secondary mirrors and the original absorber of representative benchmark parabolic mirrors. In some cases, the required dimensions for the flat secondary reflector would make it a non-realistic solution due to the impossibility of encapsulating it within a glass cover. To overcome this issue a proposal of a shortened version of the secondary mirror is evaluated in the simulations. A shortened secondary flat reflector will decrease the pernicious effects of the shading that the secondary mirror projects over the primary mirror, but will change the tolerance to misalignments of the troughs as well. An additional advantage of the inclusion of a secondary optics in the parabolic trough is the increase of uniformity of the flux around the absorber; that will reduce temperature gradients and thermal stress and could have implications on the thermal performance of the troughs. Literature is not completely clear about the effect of the flux distribution on the performance of parabolic trough receivers and to offer a better understanding of them CFD simulations are conducted for an evacuated and a non-evacuated absorber under different flux profile conditions, considering as well the influence of flow rate in the heat transfer fluid and wind velocity on the glass cover. The influence of the flux distribution on the thermal performance of the absorbers is demonstrated, but the decrease of performance caused by irregular fluxes can be compensated with an increase of flow rate which will not cause a noticeable increase in pumping power. The increase of the concentration achieved with the secondary flat reflector is significant, but the associated shading will decrease the energy input to the mirror. CFD simulations for two representative benchmark absorbers and their modifications with a secondary flat receiver show a potential increase of performance, especially for an evacuated tube and a shortened flat secondary reflector. A similar performance was obtained when evaluating the receivers with no wind, maximum flow rates, and low emissivities. However, the secondary flat reflector receiver will improve the performance of parabolic trough receivers at maximum flow rates up to 3 % if emissivity and wind velocity increases and the increases are higher if the flow rate is decreased. As power plants are required to work at different flow rates depending on the solar irradiation available, the lower drop of performance when the flow rate is decreased would help to increase the efficiency of the plants. In the case of the non-evacuated absorber, the increase of performance does not happen in the range of working temperatures of those collectors, which is lower than the evacuated ones, if low emissivities are considered. However, the emissivity of non-evacuated absorbers is normally higher than the evacuated ones. The inclusion of an insulation layer in the upper part of the receiver or the modification of the secondary reflector to act as a flat plate collector in its upper surface to recover the shadow losses would make the secondary flat reflector receiver offer higher performance than the standard one. In any case, it is shown how the secondary flat reflector can improve the thermal performance of the collectors if the output temperature is increased. This would help to increase the efficiency of the Rankine cycle for electricity generation or increase the applications for industrial heat. If alternative fluids such as Molten Salts allow working temperatures near 500 &deg;C the flat secondary receivers could become a promising solution to increase parabolic troughs performance. Finally, an experimental comparison was conducted for both a standard and a <b>secondary</b> flat non-evacuated <b>absorbers.</b> Due to limitations in the experimental facility the temperature range of the test was limited to 100 &deg;C. In this case, due to real misalignments and inaccuracies on the primary mirror, the flat secondary reflector offered a higher performance than the standard one, and it is proof that, in real conditions, the optical efficiency of those collectors can be higher than the standard ones due to a better tolerance to misalignments...|$|R
