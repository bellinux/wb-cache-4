40|$|During 1978, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), under {{contract}} with the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), initiated research on imprinting salmon and steelhead trout for homing. The primary objectives of the homing research are as follows: (1) determine whether a <b>single</b> <b>imprint</b> or a series of stimuli (sequential imprinting) are necessary to assure homing for various stocks of salmonids; (2) determine a triggering mechanism to activate the homing imprint in salmonids; (3) determine {{the relationship between the}} physiological condition of fish (gill ATPase activity, etc.) and their ability to imprint. The ability to activate the imprint mechanism at the proper time should assure a suitable homing cue that, coupled with transportation, will result in high smolt survival and insure adequate return to the homing site or hatchery. For the purposes of this study, imprinting is accepted to mean a rapid and irreversible learning experience that provides fish with the ability to return to natal streams or a selected site. In our tests, we used <b>single</b> <b>imprints</b> and sequential <b>imprints.</b> <b>Single</b> <b>imprinting</b> means cueing fish to a unique, single water supply prior to release.

The potential of the technology is demonstrated by the fabrication of microcrystalline silicon thin-film prototype solar cells. The high accuracy replication of random microstructures made from sputtered and etched ZnO:Al, used to scatter the incident light in thin solar cells, is shown by local topography investigations of the same 7. 5 [*]×[*] 7. 5 [*]µm 2 area on the master and the replica. Different types of imprint resists and <b>imprint</b> <b>moulds</b> were investigated to find the optimal, high precision replication technology. Two types of thin-film silicon solar cells, in p-i-n and n-i-p configuration, were fabricated to study the potential of the imprint technology for different applications. It is shown that solar cells deposited on an imprinted glass hold similar performances compared with reference solar cells fabricated with a standard process on textured ZnO:Al. Thus, it is demonstrated that the replication of light scattering structures by using an imprint process is an attractive method to decouple the scattering properties from the layer forming the electrical front contact. Because a simple and cheap high throughput process is used, this study additionally proves the relevance for the industrial mass production in the field of photovoltaic...|$|R

5000|$|Imprint {{lithography}} {{is inherently}} a three-dimensional patterning process. Imprint molds can be fabricated with {{multiple layers of}} topography stacked vertically.

A broader range of materials with varying properties are available for use with imprint lithography. The increased material variability gives chemists the freedom to design new functional materials rather than sacrificial etch resistant polymers. [...] A functional material may be imprinted directly to form a layer in a chip with no need for pattern transfer into underlying materials. The successful implementation of a functional imprint material would result in significant cost reductions and increased throughput by eliminating many difficult chip fabrication processing steps.|$|R
30|$|In {{a recent}} work, Schmid et al. [2] {{proposed}} a damascene process based on imprint lithography to fabricate metal interconnect. Via-holes and trenches are created in a <b>single</b> <b>imprint</b> step using a mold having two pattern levels consisting of pillars {{sitting on top}} of ridges. When imprintable dielectric material is used as a UV-curable imprint resist, the number of steps of such a process is only one-third that of the standard photolithography-based dual damascene process. However, for the imprint damascene process to become a practical manufacturing method, one-first needs to fabricate a 3 D imprint mold (template) with acceptable overlay error between the two pattern levels. This is not trivial because, unlike projection optical lithography where 4 × reduction is used, imprint is a 1 × process where the overlay error in the mold will be transferred to the resist without any error reduction.|$|R

40|$|Human {{vision is}} able to {{immediately}} recognize novel visual categories after seeing just {{one or a few}} training examples. We describe how to add a similar capability to ConvNet classifiers by directly setting the final layer weights from novel training examples during low-shot learning. We call this process weight imprinting as it directly sets weights for a new category based on an appropriately scaled copy of the embedding layer activations for that training example. The imprinting process provides a valuable complement to training with stochastic gradient descent, as it provides immediate good classification performance and an initialization for any further fine-tuning in the future. We show how this imprinting process is related to proxy-based embeddings. However, it differs in that only a <b>single</b> <b>imprinted</b> weight vector is learned for each novel category, rather than relying on a nearest-neighbor distance to training instances as typically used with embedding methods.

Seven experimental groups are discussed: four steelhead, two fall chinook salmon, and one coho salmon. In four groups, survival was enhanced by the imprinting-transportation procedures.

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{regulate}} {{gene expression}} at the post-transcriptional level and {{are important for}} coordinating nervous system development and neuronal function in the mature brain. We have recently identified schizophrenia-associated alteration of cortical miRNA biogenesis and expression in post-mortem brain tissue with implications for the dysregulation of schizophrenia candidate genes. Although these changes were observed in the central nervous system, it is plausible that schizophrenia-associated miRNA expression signatures may also be detected in non-neural tissue. To explore this possibility, we investigated the miRNA expression profile of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) from 112 patients with schizophrenia and 76 non-psychiatric controls. miRNA expression analysis of total RNA conducted using commercial miRNA arrays revealed that 33 miRNAs were significantly downregulated after correction for multiple testing with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0 %, which increased to 83 when we considered miRNA with an FDR< 5 %. Seven miRNAs altered in microarray analysis of schizophrenia were also confirmed to be downregulated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

Recent evidence suggests that these dynamic and influential molecules {{play an important role in}} both brain development and the cellular response to stress. In our recent studies, we investigate the role of microRNA in the brains’ response to maternal immune activation and adolescent cannabinoid exposure, alone and in combination, as both have been identified as environmental risk factors for this disorder. We found that combined exposure to significantly altered microRNA expression in the left hemisphere of the entorhinal cortex as compared to the right. These changes were dominated by a large subgroup of microRNA transcribed from a <b>single</b> <b>imprinted</b> locus on chromosome 6 q 32 that is associated with schizophrenia. These changes correlated with altered gene expression in the combined treatment group, with microRNA-gene interactions predicted to regulate neuronal growth and differentiation; development of specific cortical layers; synaptic plasticity and transmission; axonogenesis; gamma-Aminobutyric acid neurotransmitter system; and learning and memory formation. These findings suggested that the interaction of both an early and late environmental insult enhances changes in offspring microRNA expression in the brain with possible outcomes relevant to neurological disorders in adulthood...|$|R
