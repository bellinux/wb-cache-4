It can occur in different ways, from a minor anomaly to complete absence of the radius, radial side of the carpal bones and thumb. [...] Hypoplasia of the distal humerus may be present as well {{and can lead to}} <b>stiffnes</b> of the elbow. Radial deviation of the wrist is caused by lack of support to the carpus, radial deviation may be reinforced if forearm muscles are functioning poorly or have abnormal insertions.

40|$|The {{torsional}} stiffness of a vehicle's chassis significantly affects its handling characteristics {{and is therefore}} an important parameter to measure. In this work a new twist fixture apparatus designed to measure the {{torsional stiffness}} of a Winston Cup series race car chassis is described. The twist fixture is relatively light weight, adjustable, and easily transportable by one person for quick set-up on different chassis. Measured values of torsional stiffness are reported for several different chassis. The fixture applies vertical displacements (using linear, jack-screw actuators) at the front spring perches of the chassis while holding the rear perches fixed. Conventional race car scales located under the front assembly measure the resulting reaction forces due to the displacements. Dial indicators are placed at selected locations along the chassis to measure deflections. Using the dial indicator readings, the measured reaction forces and the chassis geometry, the torsional <b>stiffne</b> [...] ...|$|R

These nonlinearities need to be to estimated either for better control or to use the parameters for diagnosis of the system. There {{is a lot of}} work done within system identification and mainly within the field of iterative parameter estimation. This thesis considers recursive grey-box identification for a nonlinear model of the transmission in an industrial robot. The nonlinearities that are identified are friction, spring <b>stiffnes,</b> hysteresis and backlash. These nonlinearities {{are a part of the}} models that are presented in this thesis.

Estimation of linear and nonlinear friction and linear spring <b>stiffnes</b> works relatively well. Nonlinear spring <b>stiffnes</b> and hysteresis have not been possible to estimate.

Then, the joint stiffness yielding the closest workspace stiffness is searched for. Experimental results are reported, which agree with the theoretical outcomes, showing that the sub-optimal joints stiffness settings allow the arm to follow the circular trajectory on the uneven surface at best.
