50|$|With {{the advent}} of digital {{sampling}} and music editing on the computer, breakbeats have become much easier to create and use. Now, instead of cutting and <b>splicing</b> <b>tape</b> sections or constantly backspinning two records at the same time, a computer program {{can be used to}} cut, paste, and loop breakbeats endlessly. Digital effects like filters, reverb, reversing, time stretching and pitch shifting can be added to the beat, and even to individual sounds by themselves. Individual instruments from within a breakbeat can be sampled and combined with others, thereby creating wholly new breakbeat patterns.|$|E

After an experiment in which Botkin sped up the recording by wrapping <b>splicing</b> <b>tape</b> around the capstan of the recorder, he and Ward agreed that the finished recording (with bird and surf sound effects added) would not be just a demo but a recording to be released as a 45 revolutions-per-minute single.|$|E

5000|$|Originally, all Eastman Color films, ECN and ECP alike, were on {{triacetate}} base (no Eastman Color {{films were}} ever made on nitrate base), but recent practice {{has been for}} ECN elements to be on triacetate base, so these may be easily spliceable (using lap-type cemented splices, also called [...] "negative assembly" [...] splices), and for ECP elements to be on polyester base, so these are not spliceable (except by using butt-type splices with polyester <b>splicing</b> <b>tapes).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Mothlight is {{a silent}} [...] "collage film" [...] that {{incorporates}} [...] "real world elements." [...] Brakhage produced the film {{without the use}} of a camera, using what he then described as [...] "a whole new film technique." [...] Brakhage collected moth wings, flower petals, and blades of grass, and pressed them between two strips of 16mm <b>splicing</b> <b>tape.</b> The resulting assemblage was then contact printed at a lab to allow projection in a cinema. The objects chosen were required to be thin and translucent, to permit the passage of light. Brakhage reused the technique to produce his later film, The Garden of Earthly Delights (1981). Mothlight has been described as boasting a [...] "three-part musical structure." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song's title, {{coined by}} the band's drummer Chuck Ruff, {{derives from the}} fact that the {{original}} recording of the song was much longer than the final version, as the band would often deviate from the arrangement into less structured jams. The track required numerous edits to shorten it. The end result was pieced together from many sections of recording tape using a razor blade and <b>splicing</b> <b>tape.</b> Winter frequently refers to the appropriateness of the name also in relation to its [...] "monster-like, lumbering beat". (One riff was first used by Winter in the song [...] "Hung Up", on his jazz-oriented first album Entrance.

5000|$|The {{show was}} {{recorded}} at NBC's Burbank facility using two-inch quadruplex videotape. Since computer-controlled online editing {{had not been}} invented at the time, post-production video editing of the montage was achieved by the error-prone method of visualizing the recorded track with ferrofluid and cutting it with a razor blade or guillotine cutter and <b>splicing</b> with video <b>tape,</b> {{in a manner similar}} to film editing. This had the incidental benefit of ensuring that the master tape would be preserved, since a <b>spliced</b> <b>tape</b> could not be recycled for further use. Laugh-In editor Arthur Schneider won an Emmy Award in 1968 for his pioneering use of the [...] "jump cut" [...] - the unique editing style in which a sudden cut from one shot to another was made without a fade-out.|$|R

5000|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, 3M {{introduced}} the first digital multi-track recorder. It utilized 1-inch wide tape and recorded 32 tracks. Unlike analog tape, edits {{could not be}} accomplished with a grease pencil, razor blades and <b>splicing</b> <b>tape.</b> So a secondary 4 track editing & mix down recorder was also created with an electronically-controlled edit controller to make effective digital edits. This early system used a 16-bit digital [...] "word". Unfortunately, the only converters of the day were 12 bit & 4 bit. So two were cascaded/daisy-chained to create the necessary 16-bit [...] "word" [...] for 96 DB of dynamic range. The signal was then sampled faster than any other digital recordings made up until that time at 50,000 times per second (50 kHz). It {{was known to be}} the best sounding of all the later digital multi-track recorders because their use of 50 kHz sampling did not become the industry standards later established as 44.1 kHz for CD's & 48 kHz for digital video.|$|E
5000|$|The {{accepted}} world {{standard was}} created by Sony along with Philips. Sony created a 24 track digital recorder and Mitsubishi Corporation created a different 32 track digital recorder. The Mitsubishi recorded their data differently {{and it could be}} edited, the old-fashioned analog way, with a razor blade and <b>splicing</b> <b>tape.</b> The Sony used 1/2 inch tape whereas the Mitsubishi used 1 inch wide tape. So the first recordings that were released produced on the 3M, 32 track digital recorder were still analog vinyl releases, since the CD had yet to be invented. These professional linear tape digital recorders established the [...] "DASH" [...] format meaning, [...] " [...] Digital Audio Stationary Head". By the time the other manufacturers released their digital multi-track recorders, the CD had already been developed. The sampling rate dictates the upper range of the frequency response, whereas the bit depth dictates the dynamic range and signal to noise ratios.|$|E
5000|$|Being an {{expensive}} album the producers {{were able to}} make early use of an eight-track professional reel-to-reel recorder, which was used to mix second generation four-track tape that had been transferred from another four-track recording for overdubs. This was during an era when most studios were still limited to four-track machines. Parks has added that the bulk of the album was done [...] "before Sgt. Pepper reared its ugly head", and that Randy Newman had written [...] "Vine Street" [...] especially for him. Many Los Angeles recording facilities were used, not because of any particular sound preference, but to maximize studio time. Song Cycle contained experimental production and recording methods, including varispeed and regenerated tape delay. Audio engineer Bruce Botnick is credited for inventing the [...] "Farkle" [...] effect, an ingenious modification to a Sunset Sound Recorders echo box. The Farkle effect was used most prominently on violins, harps, and the intro to [...] "The All Golden", and involved very thin <b>splicing</b> <b>tape</b> folded like a fan attached to a tape overhead.|$|E
50|$|The {{disadvantages}} of physically editing tapes were many. Some broadcasters decreed that edited tapes {{could not be}} reused, {{in an era when}} the relatively high cost of the machines and tapes was balanced by the savings involved in being able to wipe and reuse the media. Others, such as the BBC, allowed reuse of <b>spliced</b> <b>tape</b> in certain circumstances as long as it conformed to strict criteria about the number of splices in a given duration, usually a maximum of five splices for every half hour. The process required great skill, and often resulted in edits that would roll (lose sync) and each edit required several minutes to perform, although this was also initially true of the electronic editing that came later.|$|R
5000|$|For the recording, Reich {{used two}} normal Wollensak tape {{recorders}} {{with the same}} recording, originally attempting to align the phrase with itself at the halfway point (180 degrees). However, due to the imprecise technology in 1965, the two recordings fell out of sync, with one tape gradually falling ahead or behind the other due to minute differences in the machines, {{the length of the}} <b>spliced</b> <b>tape</b> loops, and playback speed. Reich decided to exploit what is known as phase shifting, where all possible recursive harmonies are explored before the two loops eventually get back in sync. The following year, Reich created another composition, Come Out, in which the phrase [...] "come out to show them" [...] is looped to create the same effect.|$|R
50|$|They make {{extensive}} use of reel-to-reel audio tape recording, and incorporate techniques of Musique concrète composers, which {{is not limited to}} <b>tape</b> <b>splicing</b> and re-sequencing, <b>tape</b> reverse, pitch/speed alteration etc. Their performances {{have more in common with}} avant garde happenings from the late 1950s and early 1960s than traditional rock concerts. Their music is heavily influenced by Minimalist music, such as La Monte Young and Terry Riley, and electronic composers, such as Hugh Le Caine and Karlheinz Stockhausen.|$|R
5000|$|Perrey {{was born}} Jean Leroy in France on 20 January 1929. He was {{studying}} medicine in Paris {{when he met}} Georges Jenny, {{the inventor of the}} Ondioline, a type of electronic keyboard. Quitting medical school, Perrey travelled through Europe demonstrating this precursor of the modern synthesizer. At the age of 30, Perrey relocated to New York, sponsored by Caroll Bratman, who built him an experimental laboratory and recording studio. Here he invented [...] "a new process for generating rhythms with sequences and loops", utilising the environmental sounds of [...] "musique concrète." [...] With scissors, <b>splicing</b> <b>tape,</b> and tape recorders, he spent weeks piecing together a uniquely comique take on the future. Befriending Robert Moog, {{he became one of the}} first Moog synthesiser musicians, creating [...] "far out electronic entertainment". In 1965 Perrey met Gershon Kingsley, a former colleague of John Cage. Together, using Ondioline and Perrey's loops, they created two albums for Vanguard [...] - [...] The In Sound From Way Out (1966) and Kaleidoscopic Vibrations (1967). Perrey and Kingsley collaborated on sound design for radio and television advertising. Perrey returned to France, composing for television, scoring for ballet, and continuing medical research into therapeutic sounds for insomniacs.|$|E
5000|$|The great {{advantage}} of tape for studios was twofold - it allowed a performance {{to be recorded}} without the 30-minute time limitation of a phonograph disc, and it permitted a recorded performance to be edited. For the first time, audio could be manipulated as a physical entity. Tape editing is performed simply by cutting the tape at the required point, and rejoining it to another section of tape using adhesive tape, or sometimes glue. This is called a splice. The <b>splicing</b> <b>tape</b> {{has to be very}} thin to avoid impeding the tape's motion, and the adhesive is carefully formulated to avoid leaving a sticky residue on the tape or deck. Usually, the cut is made at an angle across the tape so that any [...] "click" [...] or other noise introduced by the cut is spread across a few milliseconds of the recording. The use of reels to supply and collect the tape also made it very easy for editors to manually move the tape {{back and forth across the}} heads to find the exact point they wished to edit. Tape to be spliced was clamped in a special splicing block attached to the deck near the heads to hold the tape accurately while the edit was made. A skilled editor could make these edits very rapidly and accurately. A side effect of cutting the tape at an angle is that on stereo tapes the edit occurs on one channel a split-second before the other. Long, angled splices can also be used to create a perceptible dissolve from one sound to the next; periodic segments can induce rhythmic or pulsing effects.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} conditioning, and thus {{enabling}} retrieval of intelligence from, magnetic tapes after damage from heat {{has caused the}} tape to wrinkle and curl severely thereby reducing tape width to less than one-half its original size. The damaged tape is superposed on a first piece of <b>splicing</b> <b>tape</b> with the oxide side of the magnetic tape {{in contact with the}} adhesive side of the <b>splicing</b> <b>tape</b> and then carefully smoothed by a special tool. A second piece of <b>splicing</b> <b>tape</b> is placed on the backing side of the magnetic tape then the resulting tape stack is trimmed to the original width of the magnetic tape. After the first piece of <b>splicing</b> <b>tape</b> is carefully removed from the oxide side of the damaged magnetic tape, the resulting magnetic tape is then ready to be placed into a recorder for playback...|$|E

40|$|What are the {{benefits}} of spending 200 + hours executing highly repetitive technical tasks using old-fashioned equipment {{in order to make}} a new version of a 3 minute long piece of electronic music from 60 years ago? I give a brief account of my working methods calculating parameter values, fixing and calibrating machines, <b>splicing</b> <b>tape,</b> measuring dB values using 50 s technology and discuss issues arising including the effects of large scale repetition of physical tasks; the difficulty of implementing seemingly straightforward technical instructions; the role, hierarchy and detectability of errors; the need for reflexive practice to adapt the results of technical processes to achieve the desired results. I demonstrate the sonic implications of some of my decisions by comparing the dramatic differences in sound when different techniques are used, and show the scope for musical and aesthetic judgement – interpretation and performance practice - in a seemingly solely technical process...|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{the disco}} craze {{of the late}} 1970s led {{to the release of}} {{extended}} [...] "disco" [...] versions of songs, most of which were released on 12" [...] vinyl singles. Many of these were not easily beatmixed, so DJs started to laboriously edit songs by <b>splicing</b> reel-to-reel <b>tape</b> copies, making their own, unique versions that were better structured for a dancefloor.|$|R
50|$|These splicers use an {{ultrasonic}} {{signal to}} melt the film together. They are generally used with polyester film, {{and are used}} in splicing microfilm as the splice will not break down over time as a <b>tape</b> <b>splice</b> might.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of water-borne pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA) based on acrylics is increasing {{in a variety}} of industrial areas. The have been used for manufacturing of double sided and carrier free mounting <b>tapes,</b> <b>splicing</b> <b>tapes,</b> marking and sign films, self-adhesive labels, packaging tapes, protective films and diverse high quality medical materials. Nano-sized inorganic fillers can modify diverse adhesive and self-adhesive coating properties such as tack, peel adhesion, shear strength at 20 °C and 70 °C, and removability Amorphous synthetic silica nanoparticles in form of water dispersions: Ludox PX- 30 (30 wt. % silica stabilizing with counter ion sodium), Ludox PT- 40 (40 wt. % silica stabilizing with counter ion sodium), Ludox PT- 40 AS (40 wt. % silica stabilizing with counter ion ammonium), and Ludox PW- 50 (50 wt. % silica stabilizing with counter ion sodium) (from Grace) in concentrations between 1 and 5 wt. % were used for modifying of water-born pressure-sensitive adhesive acrylics: Acronal 052, Acronal CR 516 (both BASF) and Plextol D 273 (Synthomer) properties. It has been found in this study that the nano-technologically reinforced system containing of Acronal 052 and amorphous silica Ludox PX- 30 showed a great enhancement in tack, peel adhesion and shear strength. In this paper we evaluate the performance of Acronal 052 modified with amorphous silica Ludox PX- 30...|$|R
5000|$|Stunt Island is {{a flight}} {{simulation}} video game for MS-DOS PCs released in 1992. It {{was designed by}} Adrian Stephens and Ronald J. Fortier and published by Disney Interactive. The game, marketed as [...] "The Stunt Flying and Filming Simulation", provides an island which contains {{a number of different}} film sets, such as a city, an oil rig, a canyon, and an aircraft carrier. The player can position cameras and props around these sets, and create triggers to start actions including the camera panning and an object moving. The game also has an editing mode where the player can <b>splice</b> together <b>taped</b> footage and insert sound effects.|$|R
5000|$|The Barrons' {{music was}} noticed by the avant-garde scene. During 1952-53 the studio {{was used by}} John Cage for his very first tape work Williams Mix. The Barrons were hired by Cage to be the engineers. They {{recorded}} over 600 different sounds, and arranged them with Cage's directions in various ways by <b>splicing</b> the <b>tape</b> together. The {{four and a half}} minute piece took over a year to finish. Cage also worked in the Barrons' studio on his Music for Magnetic Tape with other notable composers, including Morton Feldman, Earle Brown, and David Tudor. It was Cage who first encouraged the Barrons to consider their creations [...] "music".|$|R
50|$|In {{his early}} teens Bradley {{developed}} {{a strong interest}} in creating and manipulating music electronically using synthesizers, turntables, <b>tape</b> <b>splicing</b> and effects units. Some electronic influences Bradley cites are experimental Toronto band Syrinx led by Anne Murray keyboardist John Mills-Cockell, early Pink Floyd, Tomita, Giorgio Moroder, Eurythmics, Yaz, Thomas Dolby, Pet Shop Boys, Depeche Mode, New Order, William Orbit and Björk.|$|R
5000|$|Human accessibility. The hole {{patterns}} can be decoded visually if necessary, {{and torn}} tape can be repaired (using special all-hole pattern <b>tape</b> <b>splices).</b> Editing text on a punched tape {{was achieved by}} literally cutting and pasting the tape with scissors, glue, or by taping over a section to cover all holes and making new holes using a manual hole punch.|$|R
50|$|Use {{of short}} samples (such as the {{orchestra}} hit) became {{popular in the}} early 1980s {{with the advent of}} digital samplers. These devices allowed sounds to be replayed at specific times and at regular intervals by sequencing, which was extremely difficult through previous methods of <b>tape</b> <b>splicing.</b> Samplers also began to allow sections of audio to be edited and played by a keyboard controller.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his early}} years he was {{influenced}} by funk, street beat and R&B, also experimenting with pitch bent <b>tape</b> loops, <b>tape</b> <b>splicing,</b> field recordings, and noise tracks. Wrote City Weekend about is sound, [...] "Edgar has transformed the sounds and energies of old-school Detroit electro and techno with suped-up eroticism and funk influences." [...] He is also seen as an innovator in the genre of glitch.|$|R
