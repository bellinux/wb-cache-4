5|$|On June 21, 2015, a 37-year-old man's leg was gashed by the ride's loading {{platform}} gates. He {{was taken to}} a local hospital where his wound was <b>sutured.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} safety {{meetings}} were scheduled {{in order to}} prevent accidents on the set. One of the items on the agenda was finding the closest hospital to the set, according to make-up effects coordinator John Vulich. Furthermore, several of the cast and crew members had a fear of snakes, including Manners, David Duchovny, and John Shiban. During one of the days that the show was being prepped, a snake wrangler brought several live rattlesnakes to the set, but one escaped. It was eventually found behind Manners' desk. In order to prevent future accidents, the mouths of the snakes were <b>sutured</b> shut.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{may also}} occur with treatment; for example a {{granuloma}} can form at the suture site. Also, the <b>sutured</b> wound can tear again, as occurs {{when there is}} excessive pressure in the airways from ventilation. However, {{for people who do}} receive surgery soon after the injury to repair the lesion, outcome is usually good; the long-term outcome is good for over 90% of people who have TBI surgically repaired early in treatment. Even when surgery is performed years after the injury, the outlook is good, with low rates of death and disability and good chances of preserving lung function.|$|E
30|$|The {{constructed}} {{finite element}} model had nine <b>sutures</b> (midpalatal <b>suture,</b> naso-maxillary <b>suture,</b> zygomatico-maxillary <b>suture,</b> pterygo-maxillary <b>suture,</b> intranasal <b>suture,</b> fronto-maxillary <b>suture,</b> naso-frontal <b>suture,</b> zygomatico-temporal <b>suture,</b> zygomatico-frontal <b>suture)</b> and the spheno-occipital synchondrosis. The model allowed independent movement of the bones adjacent to the cranial <b>sutures</b> {{in response to the}} stimulated orthopedic forces.|$|R
50|$|Examples include: trigonocephaly (fusion of the metopic <b>suture),</b> brachycephaly (fusion of the coronal <b>suture),</b> dolichocephaly (fusion of the {{sagittal}} <b>suture),</b> plagiocephaly (unilateral premature {{closure of}} lambdoid and coronal <b>sutures),</b> oxycephaly (fusion of coronal and lambdoidal <b>sutures),</b> Kleeblattschaedel (premature closure of all <b>sutures).</b>|$|R
30|$|Upon {{comparison}} of the <b>suture</b> techniques, the inside-out technique provided a more stable fixation at the repair site than the all-inside technique during the cyclic test. Among the <b>suture</b> methods, the vertical <b>suture</b> had more desirable biomechanical properties than the horizontal <b>suture</b> as demonstrated by smaller widening during the cyclic test and the larger load to failure. The stacked <b>suture</b> created a stronger fixation than the parallel <b>suture.</b> In {{terms of the number}} of <b>sutures,</b> the double <b>suture</b> had superior biomechanical properties compared with the single <b>suture.</b>|$|R
5|$|The neck {{formed a}} straighter S shape (a sigmoid curve typical of theropods) than that seen in other theropods; in fact, the neck was {{initially}} thought to lack the Scurve. The {{shape of the}} cervical vertebrae indicate that they tapered towards the head and were progressively longer front to back. The neural spines of the cervical vertebrae were low, thin, and were not always <b>sutured</b> to the centra (the bodies of the vertebrae). The axis vertebra, small relative {{to the size of}} the skull, had a well-developed hyposphene. The centra of the dorsal vertebrae were similar in size. Like other dinosaurs, Baryonyx reduced its weight (skeletal pneumaticity) with fenestrae (openings) in the neural arches and with pleurocoels (hollow depressions) in the centra (primarily near the transverse processes). From front to back, the neural spines of the dorsal vertebrae changed from short and stout to tall and broad.|$|E
25|$|The sternum is wired {{together}} and the incisions are <b>sutured</b> closed.|$|E
25|$|After this a {{longitudinal}} incision {{should be made}} over the triceps tendon in which two transverse slits are made. One end of the graft should be wrapped around the posterior deltoid and <b>sutured</b> securely to it, after which the grafted is passed through an intercutaneous tunnel towards the triceps tendon, woven through the transverse slits and <b>sutured</b> securely to the triceps tendon and itself.|$|E
50|$|The infant's skull {{consists}} of the metopic <b>suture,</b> coronal <b>sutures,</b> sagittal <b>suture,</b> and lambdoid <b>sutures.</b> The metopic <b>suture</b> is supposed to close between three and nine months of age. The coronal, sagittal, and lambdoid <b>sutures</b> are supposed to close between 22 and 39 months of age.|$|R
40|$|Dermatologists {{performing}} skin surgery mostly use {{the square}} knot. Other underused or even forgotten <b>suturing</b> techniques {{may still be}} helpful in some instances. We shall emphasize some simple techniques such as the horizontal mattress <b>suture,</b> the "cross stitch", the "corner stitch" (half buried mattress <b>suture),</b> the buried dermal <b>suture,</b> the buried vertical mattress <b>suture,</b> the continuous mattress <b>suture</b> and the running intradermal <b>suture.</b> In given circumstances, all of them may improve <b>suturing</b> and promote healing. Technical aspects, {{advantages and disadvantages of}} each type of <b>suture</b> will be briefly described. English AbstractJournal ArticleReviewinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
5000|$|The typical goniatitid has a <b>suture</b> {{with smooth}} saddles and lobes, {{which gives the}} name [...] "goniatitic" [...] to this {{particular}} <b>suture</b> pattern. In some the <b>sutures</b> has a distinctive [...] "zigzag" [...] pattern Not all goniatitid ammonoides have goniatitic <b>sutures.</b> In some the <b>sutures</b> are ceratitic, in others, even ammonitic. Nor are goniatitic <b>sutures</b> limited to the Goniatidia. The <b>sutures</b> of nautiloids are by comparison somewhat simpler, being either straight or slightly curved, whereas later ammonoids showed <b>suture</b> patterns of increasing complexity. One explanation for this increasing extravagancy in <b>suture</b> pattern is that it leads to a higher strength of the shell.|$|R
25|$|The left atrial {{appendage}} {{can also be}} surgically amputated, <b>sutured</b> or stapled simultaneously with other cardiac procedures such as a maze procedure or during mitral valve surgery.|$|E
25|$|After the breast-lift surgery, wound care {{is minimal}} when the <b>sutured</b> closure is subcuticular (under the epidermis), and {{reinforced}} with strips of absorbable adhesive tape (butterfly stitches) applied {{to maintain the}} wound closed.|$|E
25|$|The {{replaceable}} {{models of}} implantable heart valve prostheses are typically supplied with a sewing or suturing ring surrounding the valve body or stent {{that is to}} be <b>sutured</b> by the surgeon to the valvar rim.|$|E
50|$|A barbed <b>suture</b> {{is a type}} of knotless {{surgical}} <b>suture</b> {{that has}} barbs on its surface. While <b>suturing</b> tissue, these barbs penetrate inside the tissue and lock them into place, eliminating the need for knots to tie the <b>suture.</b> Conventional <b>sutures</b> rely on a surgeon's ability to tie secure knots; barbed <b>sutures</b> provide a knotless alternative in some surgical situations. Barbed <b>sutures</b> are primarily used in cosmetic surgery.|$|R
5000|$|... d) <b>Suture</b> {{techniques}} include horizontal pledgeted mattress <b>sutures,</b> {{and running}} polypropylene <b>suture.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{primitive}} {{state of}} the dorsal <b>sutures</b> is proparian. Opisthoparian <b>sutures</b> have developed several times independently. There are no examples of proparian <b>sutures</b> developing in taxa with opisthoparian ancestry. Trilobites that exhibit opisthoparian <b>sutures</b> as adults commonly have proparian <b>sutures</b> as instars (known exceptions being Yunnanocephalus and Duyunaspis). Hypoparian <b>sutures</b> have also arisen independently in several groups of trilobites.|$|R
25|$|After the nasolabial flap {{has been}} emplaced, the flap donor-site wound is <b>sutured</b> closed. For a wound of the lateral nasal wall {{that is less}} than 15mm wide, the flap donor-site can be closed primarily, with sutures. For a wound wider than 15mm—especially a wound that comprehends the alar lobule and the lateral wall of the nose—primary closure is not indicated, because such a wound closure imposes {{excessive}} stresses upon the skin flap, thereby risking either blanching (whitening) or distortion, or both. Such risks are avoided by advancing (moving) {{the skin of the}} cheek towards the nasofacial junction, where it is <b>sutured</b> to the deep tissues. Furthermore, a narrow wound, less than 1mm wide can be allowed to heal by secondary intention (autonomous re-epithelialisation).|$|E
25|$|Skin {{grafting}} is patching of {{a defect}} with skin that {{is removed from}} another site in the body. The skin graft is <b>sutured</b> {{to the edges of}} the defect, and a bolster dressing is placed atop the graft for seven to ten days, to immobilize the graft as it heals in place. There are two forms of skin grafting: split thickness and full thickness. In a split thickness skin graft, a shaver is used to shave a layer of skin from the abdomen or thigh. The donor site regenerates skin and heals over a period of two weeks. In a full thickness skin graft, a segment of skin is totally removed and the donor site needs to be <b>sutured</b> closed.|$|E
25|$|Continental {{collision}} is {{a phenomenon}} of the plate tectonics of Earth that occurs at convergent boundaries. Continental collision is {{a variation on the}} fundamental process of subduction, whereby the subduction zone is destroyed, mountains produced, and two continents <b>sutured</b> together. Continental collision is known only to occur on Earth.|$|E
30|$|Either the {{vertical}} or horizontal <b>suture</b> method is conventionally used in meniscal repair (Henning et al. 1998; Post et al. 1997; Song and Lee 1999). This {{study showed that}} {{the vertical}} <b>suture</b> method was superior in biomechanical properties to the horizontal <b>suture</b> method. Rimmer et al. also reported that failure load (67  N) of vertical <b>sutures</b> was superior to that of horizontal <b>sutures</b> (29.3  N) when performed on cadaveric menisci using the inside-out technique with No. 3 - 0 Ethibond <b>suture</b> (Rimmer et al. 1995). Becker et al. investigated the displacement of both <b>suture</b> methods after cyclic loading in a cadaver model, and reported that vertical <b>sutures</b> provided significantly less displacement {{in comparison with the}} horizontal <b>sutures</b> (Becker et al. 2002). The horizontal <b>sutures</b> encircled parallel to the circumferential meniscal fibers; whereas, the vertical <b>suture</b> encircled perpendicular to those fibers (Post et al. 1997; Rimmer et al. 1995). Therefore, higher rate of partial tissue failures could occur in the horizontal <b>suture</b> and result in lower stability during the cyclic test (Seil et al. 2000). Moreover, it was difficult to equally load to both <b>sutures</b> during tests in horizontal <b>suture</b> technique. Then, one <b>suture</b> in the horizontal <b>suture</b> might receive higher load with earlier rupture because of the distance between the two <b>sutures.</b> This imbalance of loading can exist in clinical situation {{as well as in the}} experimental setting. Thus, further caution is needed for period of weight bearing after meniscal horizontal <b>suture.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{zygomatic}}ofrontal <b>suture</b> (or frontozygomatic <b>suture)</b> is the cranial <b>suture</b> {{between the}} zygomatic bone and the frontal bone. The <b>suture</b> can be palpated just lateral to the eye.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present our initial work on {{simulating}} <b>suture</b> and <b>suturing</b> using mass-spring models. Various models for simulating <b>suture</b> were studied, {{and a simple}} linear mass-spring model of the <b>suture</b> was determined to give good performance. A novel model for pulling a <b>suture</b> through a deformable surface is presented. By connecting two separate surfaces through the <b>suture,</b> our model can simulate a <b>suturing</b> task. The results are shown using software we developed that runs on a standard PC and models the action of a <b>suturing</b> device used in minimally invasive Laparoscopic surgery...|$|R
25|$|Photograph A. – Open rhinoplasty: At rhinoplasty's end, {{after the}} plastic surgeon has <b>sutured</b> (closed) the incisions, the {{corrected}} (new) nose will be dressed, taped, and splinted immobile {{to permit the}} uninterrupted healing of the surgical incisions. The purple-ink guidelines ensured the surgeon’s accurate cutting of the defect correction plan.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the Proterozoic, Archean rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep-water sediments, such as graywackes, mudstones, volcanic sediments and banded iron formations. Greenstone belts are typical Archean formations, consisting of alternating high- and low-grade metamorphic rocks. The high-grade rocks were derived from volcanic island arcs, while the low-grade metamorphic rocks represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island frogs and deposited in a forearc basin. In short, greenstone belts represent <b>sutured</b> protocontinents.|$|E
25|$|In {{those with}} a retinal tear, efforts to prevent it {{becoming}} a detachment include cryotherapy using a cold probe or photocoagulation using a laser. Treatment of retinal detachment should be carried out in a timely manner. This may include scleral buckling where silicone is <b>sutured</b> {{to the outside of}} the eye, pneumatic retinopexy where gas is injected into the eye, or vitrectomy where the vitreous is partly removed and replaced with either gas or oil.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to single layer <b>suturing,</b> two layer <b>suturing</b> generally involves <b>suturing</b> at {{a deeper level}} of a tissue followed by another layer of <b>suturing</b> at a more superficial level. For example, Cesarean section can be performed with single or double layer <b>suturing</b> of the uterine incision.|$|R
30|$|Concerning {{the double}} <b>sutures</b> in the inside-out technique, the {{parallel}} <b>sutures</b> {{had a significantly}} lower failure load than the stacked <b>sutures.</b> As previously described, the imbalance of loading to <b>sutures</b> must occur in this comparison because {{it is difficult to}} simultaneously add the same load to both <b>sutures.</b> Thus, the stacked <b>suture</b> could be expected to provide a more stable fixation in the clinical setting.|$|R
30|$|The maximum {{stresses}} {{generated in}} the I-RME (6.98  MPa) remained high in case of pterygo-maxillary <b>suture</b> {{as compared to the}} plain RME model (3.87  MPa). The stress pattern was tensile in nature for both the cases. The literature related to stress pattern for this particular <b>suture</b> remain scanty. The stresses generated in this <b>suture</b> are greater in comparison to other <b>suture</b> except for the midpalatal <b>suture.</b> As pterygo-maxillary <b>suture</b> is nearer to the midplatal <b>suture,</b> the stresses generated are greater.|$|R
25|$|The flap {{is allowed}} to perfuse, while the donor site is <b>sutured</b> closed {{by means of the}} wide {{undermining}} deep to the frontalis muscle. At that time, diluted epinephrine can be injected to the forehead skin, but not to the area(s) near the pedicle of the forehead flap. Moreover, if the distal wound is wider than 25mm, it usually is not closed by primary intention, with sutures, but {{is allowed to}} heal by secondary intention, by re-epithelialisation.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{conventional}} surgery performed for glaucoma is the trabeculectomy. Here, a partial thickness flap {{is made in}} the scleral wall of the eye, and a window opening is made under the flap to remove a portion of the trabecular meshwork. The scleral flap is then <b>sutured</b> loosely back in place to allow fluid to flow out of the eye through this opening, resulting in lowered intraocular pressure and the formation of a bleb or fluid bubble {{on the surface of the}} eye.|$|E
25|$|When appropriate, {{a nearby}} donor {{may be used}} to supply {{innervation}} to lesioned nerves. Trauma to the donor can be minimized by utilizing a technique known as end-to-side repair. In this procedure, an epineurial window is created in the donor nerve and the proximal stump of the lesioned nerve is <b>sutured</b> over the window. Regenerating axons are redirected into the stump. Efficacy of this technique is partially dependent upon the degree of partial neurectomy performed on the donor, with increasing degrees of neurectomy giving rise to increasing axon regeneration within the lesioned nerve, but with the consequence of increasing deficit to the donor.|$|E
30|$|To our knowledge, {{the present}} study is the first to compare {{single-layer}} running <b>suturing</b> techniques with interrupted <b>sutures</b> for closure of the vaginal cuff. Additionally, cuff closure using a running vicryl <b>suture</b> with TEM clips is a newly introduced alternative to other <b>suturing</b> techniques currently in use. The safety and effectiveness of barded <b>sutures</b> already has been demonstrated in two other studies [3, 6]. However, one was non-comparative and in the other a more time-consuming double-layer <b>suturing</b> method was used. Furthermore, the barbed <b>suture</b> proved to be relatively easy to learn [6]. In our experience as well, both the single-layer barbed <b>suture</b> and the single-layer running vicryl <b>suture</b> with TEM clips proved to be easy to adopt and as safe—regarding incidence of VCD—as transvaginal and laparoscopic closure of the vaginal cuff with interrupted <b>sutures.</b>|$|R
50|$|In some {{individuals}} the <b>suture</b> can persist (totally or partly) into adulthood, {{and in these}} cases it {{is referred to as}} a persistent metopic <b>suture.</b> The <b>suture</b> can either bisect the frontal bone and run from nasion to bregma or persist as a partial metopic <b>suture</b> (see image of frontal bone) (where part of the <b>suture</b> survives and is connected to either bregma or nasion) or as an isolated metopic fissure. Persistent frontal <b>sutures</b> are of no clinical significance, although they can be mistaken for cranial fractures. As persistent frontal <b>sutures</b> are visible in radiographs, they can be useful for the forensic identification of human skeletal remains. Persistent frontal <b>sutures</b> {{should not be confused with}} supranasal <b>sutures</b> (a small zig-zag shaped <b>suture</b> located at and/or immediately superior to the glabella).|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Post {{operative}} {{adjustment of}} a single continuous <b>suture</b> is {{an effective means of}} reducing post keratoplasty astigmatism. This study evaluates post keratoplasty keratometry following <b>suture</b> adjustment with an adjusted <b>suture</b> in place and after the <b>suture</b> is removed. METHODS: Average keratometric astigmatism was measured over 24 months time in 26 patients with an adjusted continuous <b>suture</b> and 24 patients with a continuous <b>suture</b> that was not adjusted. Average keratometry in 43 patients with an adjusted continuous <b>suture</b> was compared with 37 patients with combined continuous and interrupted <b>sutures.</b> Finally, <b>suture</b> out astigmatism in 19 adjusted patients was compared to six patients with no adjustment. RESULTS: There was an increase in average corneal astigmatism over two years of 2. 2 diopters in the adjusted group and 1. 7 diopters in the non-adjusted group with <b>sutures</b> in place. One year following surgery, average keratometry flattened from 47. 5 to 42. 9 diopters in the adjusted continuous group and from 47. 0 to 46. 0 diopters in the group with combined continuous and interrupted <b>sutures.</b> Following <b>suture</b> removal, average astigmatism in patients who had <b>suture</b> adjustment was 4. 4 diopters +/- 2. 5 diopters (range 1 - 10 diopters), and 6. 01 diopters (range 4 - 7) in the non-adjusted group. CONCLUSIONS: Average post keratoplasty astigmatism increases after a continuous <b>suture</b> is adjusted but the increase is comparable to patients with acceptable astigmatism who do not require adjustment. More progressive corneal flattening over 12 months time is seen with a continuous <b>suture</b> than which combined <b>sutures.</b> Average <b>suture</b> out astigmatism was 4. 0 diopters following <b>suture</b> adjustment, compared to an average of 8. 4 diopters prior to adjustment...|$|R
