2500|$|Every adult human excretes between 200 and 1000 {{grams of}} {{phosphorus}} annually. [...] Studies of United States sewage {{in the late}} 1960s estimated mean per capita contributions of 500 grams in urine and feces, 1000 grams in <b>synthetic</b> <b>detergents,</b> and lesser variable amounts used as corrosion and scale control chemicals in water supplies. Source control via alternative detergent formulations has subsequently reduced the largest contribution, but the content of urine and feces will remain unchanged. [...] Phosphorus removal is important {{as it is a}} limiting nutrient for algae growth in many fresh water systems. (For a description of the negative effects of algae, see Nutrient removal). It is also particularly important for water reuse systems where high phosphorus concentrations may lead to fouling of downstream equipment such as reverse osmosis.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{was focused on}} the understanding of the biodegradability of <b>synthetic</b> anionic <b>detergent</b> powder available in Sri Lankan market. Eight different types of <b>synthetic</b> <b>detergent</b> powders were selected. LAS contents of the selected products were measured according to ASTM D 3049 - 89 standard. The biodegradability was measured as the reduction percentage of LAS initially present within a specific period. The phosphate content in the detergents were measured by SLS 760 1986 method and the pH of the media also was obtained to find any relationship between these parameters. The results found that the biodegradability of LAS in detergent powder is ranged between 24 - 79. This study found that the biodegradability of anionic surfactants highly depend on the phosphate content of the product. According to SLS 7601986 minimum LAS which has to be maintained in the Sri Lankan <b>synthetic</b> <b>detergent</b> and the existing legislations for the manufacturing marketing and consuming of detergent products should have modified for the health and safety environment. Therefore further studies need to be conducted to determine the maximum allowable level of phosphates lead to the highest level of biodegradability...|$|R

A literature review of studies that assessed maintenance of skin integrity in the elderly found most to be low levels of evidence but the review concluded that skin-cleansing with <b>synthetic</b> <b>detergents</b> or amphoteric surfactants induced less skin dryness than using soap and water.

The <b>synthetic</b> <b>detergent</b> industry has often introduced in business history as the case of forward integration to distribution by manufacturers in the late industrialized countries. However, this paper found that the degree of integration of forward integration was relatively weak in Thailand. There are three reasons: (1) there were not only integrations form manufacturer to wholesaler in Thailand, but also integrations from wholesaler to manufacturer by local capital, (2) Foreign retailers' actions to backwardness are rather stronger than forward integration by manufacturers in the recent years, (3) Japanese company, Kao corporation has tried to integrate its distribution channel, but Kao has to modify its marketing (brand, price and channel) policy to local conditions...|$|R
50|$|In 1969, Dr. Karsanbhai Patel, {{a chemist}} at the Gujarat Government's Department of Mining and Geology {{manufactured}} phosphate free <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Detergent</b> Powder, and started selling it locally. The new yellow powder was priced at Rs. 3.50 per kg, {{at a time}} when HUL's Surf was priced at Rs 15. Soon, there was a huge demand for Nirma in Ruppur (Gujarat), Patel's hometown. He started packing the formulation in a 10x10ft room in his house. Patel named the powder as Nirma, after his daughter Nirupama. Patel was able to sell about 15-20 packets a day {{on his way to the}} office on bicycle, some 15 km away. By 1985, Nirma washing powder had become one of the most popular, household detergents in many parts of the country.|$|R
5000|$|The {{household}} chore {{of doing}} the laundry began to change {{with the introduction of}} washing powders in the 1880s. These new laundry products were pulverized soap. New cleaning-product marketing successes, such as the 1890s introduction of the N. K.

Henkel & Cie's [...] "self-activating" [...] (or self bleaching) cleaner, Persil; (introduced in 1907); the early <b>synthetic</b> <b>detergent,</b> BASF's Fewa (introduced in 1932); and Procter & Gamble's 1933 totally synthetic creation, Dreft (marketed for use on infant-wear) [...] - all indicated significant advances in the laundry cleaning product market.|$|R

5000|$|Dispersants in oil {{drilling}} are chemicals that aid in breaking up solids or liquids as fine particles or droplets into another medium. This term is often applied incorrectly to clay deflocculants. Clay dispersants prevent formation of [...] "fish-eye" [...] globules. For dispersing (emulsification) of oil into water (or water into oils), surfactants selected {{on the basis}} of Hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) number can be used.

40|$|The heats of micellization and demicellization (DHmic and DHdemic) were {{measured}} for {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). SDS is a <b>synthetic</b> <b>detergent</b> that spontaneously forms an aggregate of individual monomers known as a micelle at and above the critical micelle concentration. The micellization process is generally a thermodynamically favored, exothermic process. At elevated temperatures, micelle stability decreases and causes the onset of demicellization. Demicellization is an endothermic process and should theoretically take in {{the same amount of}} heat as is given off during the micellization process. In our studies, the enthalpies of micellization and demicellization, as well as the critical micelle concentration for SDS were determined from DSC and ITC data. In addition, the thermodynamic parameters were obtained as a function of SDS concentration...|$|R
50|$|Soap is, by weight, {{relatively}} {{ineffective and}} it is highly sensitive to deactivation by hard water. By the 1950s, soap had almost been completely replaced by branched alkylbenzenesulfonates, but these detergents {{were found to be}} poorly biodegradable. Linear alkylbenzenesulfonates (LABs), however, proved to be both highly effective in cleaning and more biodegradable than the branched relatives. LABs remain the main detergents used domestically. Other detergents that have been developed include the linear alkylsulfonates and olefinsulfonates, which also resist deactivation by hard water. Both remain specialty products, for example only an estimated 60 million kilograms of the sodium alkylsulfonates are produced annually. During the early development of non-soap surfactants as commercial cleaning products, the term syndet, short for <b>synthetic</b> <b>detergent,</b> was promoted to indicate the distinction from so-called natural soaps.|$|R
50|$|Treatment of {{wastewater}} {{and wash}} water by EC has been practiced {{for most of}} the 20th century with increasing popularity. In the last decade, this technology has been increasingly used in the United States, South America and Europe for treatment of industrial wastewater containing metals. It has also been noted that in North America EC has been used primarily to treat wastewater from pulp and paper industries, mining and metal-processing industries. A large one-thousand gallon per minute cooling tower application in El Paso, Texas illustrates electrocoagulations growing recognition and acceptance to the industrial community. In addition, EC has been applied to treat water containing foodstuff waste, oil wastes, dyes, output from public transit and marinas, wash water, ink, suspended particles, chemical and mechanical polishing waste, organic matter from landfill leachates, defluorination of water, <b>synthetic</b> <b>detergent</b> effluents, and solutions containing heavy metals.|$|R
