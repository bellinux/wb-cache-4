5|$|Swedish <b>schoolchildren</b> tell Bellman {{jokes about}} a person named Bellman, an antihero or modern-day trickster {{with little or no}} {{connection}} to the poet. The first known Bellman joke is in a book from 1835, which quoted a letter written in 1808 by a contemporary of Bellman. 19th century Bellman jokes were told by adults and focused on Bellman's life at court; they often related to sex. In the 20th century, the 'Bellman' character became generic, the jokes were told by <b>schoolchildren,</b> and often related to bodily functions. The jokes have been studied by anthropologists and psychologists since the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|By 2005 {{there were}} 1,172 primary schools, but levels of {{enrollment}} that were low even by African standards with only around 17–19% of <b>schoolchildren</b> in primary education. Nevertheless, {{this level of}} primary enrollment was approaching pre-war levels, with secondary school enrollment also showing an increase since 1998.|$|E
5|$|Dental caries {{remains a}} major public health concern in most industrialized countries, {{affecting}} 60–90% of <b>schoolchildren</b> {{and the vast majority}} of adults. Water fluoridation reduces cavities in children, while efficacy in adults is less clear.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 {{planning}} permission was received {{for a new}} learning centre aimed at <b>schoolchildren</b> and linked to the baths by a tunnel. Funding is being sought from the Heritage Lottery Fund and, if successful, it is hoped the centre will open in 2019.|$|E

5|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} begins with Carey, revisiting her youth, wandering {{a high school}} corridor and standing inside a classroom of <b>schoolchildren</b> playing various musical instruments with inter-cutting clips of men playing on drums. Clips of a schoolgirl playing Carey are also shown, with Carey shadowing her movements, and her efforts to catch a schoolboy's attention who in turn persistently ignores her, choosing to mess about {{in the classroom and}} corridors with his friends instead. Towards the end of the video, groups of <b>schoolchildren</b> are shown dancing in the corridor as the boy she liked, now an adult, is following Carey around the school and trying to flirt with her, but Carey brushes him off. The official music video has achieved 3.3 million views on YouTube as of June 2017.|$|E
5|$|Access {{between the}} {{platforms}} is via a subway with ramps {{at the west}} end of the platforms, although the station is not considered completely accessible as the ramps are steeper than 1 in 12. The subway exits onto Fraser Street, which is the sole entrance to the station. The subway is decorated with murals painted by local <b>schoolchildren,</b> reflecting the history and culture of Bristol.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the casting}} director, Newt was the most {{difficult}} role to cast: <b>Schoolchildren</b> were auditioned, but many of them had acted in commercials and were accustomed to smiling after saying their lines. Henn, from Atwater, California was chosen out of 500 children for the role, although she had no previous acting experience. She received a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor, but chose not to pursue an acting career, and became a teacher.|$|E
5|$|Adams won the 1972 Carnegie Medal {{from the}} Library Association, {{recognising}} the year's best children's book by a British subject. He {{also won the}} annual Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, a similar award that authors may not win twice. In 1977 California <b>schoolchildren</b> selected it for the inaugural California Young Reader Medal in the Young Adult category, which annually honours one book from the last four years. In The Big Read, a 2003 survey of the British public, it was voted the forty-second greatest book of all time.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} the excavations at Mucking in 1978, the Joneses retired from field archaeology {{and returned to}} their cottage in Hereford. Margaret became the patron of the Thurrock Local History Society (the source of many volunteers to the Mucking excavation) and sat on many other archaeology committees in Essex. In this role she regularly gave lectures, guided tours and talks to <b>schoolchildren</b> across the county.|$|E
5|$|Although most English {{secondary}} schools are comprehensive, {{in some areas}} there are selective intake grammar schools, to which entrance is subject to passing the eleven-plus exam. Around 7.2% of English <b>schoolchildren</b> attend private schools, which are funded by private sources. Standards in state schools are monitored by the Office for Standards in Education, and in private schools by the Independent Schools Inspectorate.|$|E
5|$|Artist Samir Mondal {{composed}} Ishaan and Nikumbh's art-fair watercolour paintings. He held {{a workshop}} with the <b>schoolchildren,</b> and incorporated elements from their artwork into Ishaan's. Mondal also instructed Khan on a painter's typical mannerisms and movements. Gupte created {{the rest of}} Ishaan's artwork and Assistant Art Director Veer Nanavati drew Ishaan's flipbook. The art department's designs for Ishaan's school notebooks disappointed Khan, who had familiarised himself with dyslexic writing. Using his left hand, Khan instead wrote it himself.|$|E
5|$|Cemeteries, {{including}} those of war dead, are targets for vandalism. The gravestones, cemeteries and buildings of the Commission are no exception. The Commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are usually the work of young people, noting the number of incidents increases when <b>schoolchildren</b> are on school holidays. Metal theft is also a problem: determined thieves target the bronze swords from the Cross of Sacrifice, which are now replaced with replicas made of fibreglass.|$|E
5|$|Chief Guest L K Advani {{declared}} the Games open. Shooter Anjali Bhagwat took the Athlete's Oath. This {{was followed by}} a laser show, fireworks and a space cannon show. The highlight of the Opening ceremony was the Umojas - a group of professional tribal dancers from Africa. There were other international showcases - the spiritual chanting by the Chinese monks, and the peace prayers by thousands of <b>schoolchildren.</b> Singer Shankar Mahadevan sang the theme song. Bollywood divas Shilpa Shetty, Simran and Urmila Matondkar did dance performances.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{years of}} heavy promotion, the Deseret {{alphabet}} was never widely adopted. This reluctance was {{partly due to}} prohibitive costs; the project had already cost the early church $20,000, with $6,000 going to Pratt as remuneration for his transcription effort {{and most of the}} rest going to cutting metal type featuring the new alphabet and printing costs. In 1859, Parley P. Pratt estimated that the cost of supplying all Utah Territory <b>schoolchildren</b> with suitable textbooks would cost over US$5,000,000.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War the Warsaw Pact countries, {{fearing a}} food shortage, decried the beetle as a CIA plot {{to destroy the}} {{agriculture}} of the Soviet Union. Officials launched a Warsaw Pact-wide campaign {{to wipe out the}} beetle, villainizing them in propaganda posters and pulling <b>schoolchildren</b> from class to gather the bugs and drown them in buckets of benzene or spirit.|$|E
5|$|Former ACT New Zealand Member of Parliament Muriel Newman filed a {{petition}} to have New Zealand <b>schoolchildren</b> be protected from political indoctrination by putting provisions that resembled those in the UK to the Education Act. The petition {{was in response to}} concerned parents talked with Newman after An Inconvenient Truth was shown in schools in 2007. The parents were worried that teachers were not pointing out supposed inaccuracies in the film and were not explaining differing viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|From autumn 1943 the Japanese {{government}} took further steps {{to prepare the}} country's major cities for air attacks. An air defense general headquarters was established in November and a program of demolishing large numbers of buildings in major cities to create firebreaks began the next month. By {{the end of the}} war 614,000 housing units had been destroyed to clear firebreaks; these accounted for a fifth of all housing losses in Japan during the war and displaced 3.5 million people. The government also encouraged old people, children and women in cities that were believed likely to be attacked to move to the countryside from December 1943, and a program of evacuating entire classes of <b>schoolchildren</b> was implemented. By August 1944, 330,000 <b>schoolchildren</b> had been evacuated in school groups and another 459,000 had moved to the countryside with their family. Little was done to disperse industrial facilities to make them less vulnerable to attack, however, as this was logistically difficult.|$|E
5|$|He joined Southern Football League Premier Division club, Crawley Town in July 2002, {{ready for}} the 2002–03 season. Cooksey made his debut for Crawley on 26 August, against Welling United coming on as a substitute, after he {{returned}} from coaching <b>schoolchildren</b> in Las Vegas, United States for six-months. He made 34 appearances, scoring once during his spell with Crawley, helping them to finish seventh in the Southern Football League Premier Division.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, <b>schoolchildren</b> from Canton, Massachusetts {{decided that}} the book was worthy of being the {{official}} children's book of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and went to their state legislature to get a bill passed declaring it so. However, legislators from Springfield, Massachusetts blocked the legislation on the grounds the official book should be by Springfield native Dr. Seuss. Legislators reached a compromise when they agreed to make Dr. Seuss the official children's author of the commonwealth and Make Way for Ducklings the official children's book.|$|E
5|$|Riley {{returned}} {{to live near}} Indianapolis later in 1893, boarding in a private home in the Lockerbie district, then a small suburb. He developed a close friendship with his landlords, the Nickum and Holstein families. The home became a destination for local <b>schoolchildren</b> to whom Riley would regularly recite poetry and tell stories. Riley's friends frequently visited his home, and he developed a closer relationship with Eugene Debs.|$|E
5|$|Ross was {{the first}} {{governor}} to set aside a day for civic improvements, declaring the third Friday in January to be Arbor Day, when <b>schoolchildren</b> should endeavor to plant trees. He also supported the legislature's efforts to purchase the Huddle portrait gallery, a collection of paintings of each governor of Texas. These paintings continue to hang in the rotunda of the Texas State Capitol.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Kennedy {{was already}} {{known for his}} role as Ian Craig in the BBC Radio 4 soap opera The Archers. He {{mentioned}} in an interview {{the differences between the two}} roles, before quipping that they were not that dissimilar. The crew of Grafton appeared as extras throughout the series and <b>schoolchildren</b> from St. Jude's School, Southsea appeared in the families day scenes in episode six.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 {{expansion}} of the museum made space for a new education center named Art Connections.

In 1994, Art Connections received the National Award for Museum Service from the Institute of Museum and Library Services for outstanding community service.|$|E
5|$|The {{chart on}} the right depicts children's beliefs about the parity of zero, as they {{progress}} from Year 1 to Year 6 of the English education system. The data are from Len Frobisher, who conducted a pair of surveys of English <b>schoolchildren.</b> Frobisher was interested in how knowledge of single-digit parity translates to knowledge of multiple-digit parity, and zero figures prominently in the results.|$|E
5|$|The film premièred in South Africa at the 26th Durban International Film Festival (DIFF) on 17 July 2005 {{where it}} won the Best South African Film Award.

5|$|The {{flag was}} {{a tool of}} Japanese imperialism in the {{occupied}} Southeast Asian areas during Second World War: people {{had to use the}} flag, and <b>schoolchildren</b> sang Kimigayo in morning flag raising ceremonies. Local flags were allowed for some areas such as the Philippines, Indonesia, and Manchukuo. In Korea which was part of the Empire of Japan, the Hinomaru and other symbols were used to declare that the Koreans were subjects of the empire.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its range, {{the giant}} otter interacts with {{indigenous}} groups, who often practice traditional hunting and fishing. A study of five indigenous communities in Colombia suggests native {{attitudes toward the}} animal are a threat: the otters are often viewed as a nuisance that interferes with fishing, and are sometimes killed. Even when told {{of the importance of}} the species to ecosystems and the danger of extinction, interviewees showed little interest in continuing to coexist with the species. <b>Schoolchildren,</b> however, had a more positive impression of the animal.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the more}} recent {{successful}} campaigns to name a state dog have been started by <b>schoolchildren.</b> In 2007, Alaskan kindergarten student Paige Hill's idea created the campaign for the Alaskan Malamute which would convince Representative Berta Gardner to support the bill in 2009, with it becoming law in 2010. Elementary school students from Bedford, New Hampshire won their campaign for the Chinook to be accepted {{as a symbol of}} their state in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying Azzimani to the Olympics, was a {{group of}} eight <b>schoolchildren</b> from Woippy, a suburb of the French city Metz. Azzimani had {{organised}} the trip for the children, who were from an area which saw rioting following the death of a man fleeing police in January 2010. He said in an interview prior to the games that the trip for the children was more important than his own, and related it to being introduced to being introduced to skiing on a school trip of his own at the age of six years old.|$|E
5|$|Bellman {{has been}} {{translated}} into at least 20 languages, including English, most notably by Paul Britten Austin, and into German, for example by Hannes Wader. German Communist leader Karl Liebknecht liked Bellman's songs and translated some into German. Hans Christian Andersen {{was one of the}} first to translate Bellman into Danish. Bellman's songs have been translated and recorded in Icelandic (by Bubbi), Italian, French, Finnish (for instance by Vesa-Matti Loiri), Russian, Chuvash and Yiddish. English interpretations have been recorded by William Clauson, Martin Best, Freddie Langrind made some Norwegian translations in 2008. Sven-Bertil Taube, Roger Hinchliffe and Martin Bagge. <b>Schoolchildren</b> two hundred years on still learn some of his songs, and several including Gubben Noak and Fjäriln vingad are known by heart by many Swedes.|$|E
5|$|Each entry {{was limited}} to a length of 100650 words. To allow some time for {{drafting}} and proofreading, participants were allowed to upload their diary entries {{until the end of}} the month. <b>Schoolchildren</b> were encouraged to take part, with all 29,000 UK schools being invited to participate. On the day itself, the homepages of the 2,000 computers in the easyCafe network were all set to the History Matters website, and several celebrities and public figures also voiced their support of the initiative, including Stephen Fry, Bob Geldof and Tony Robinson.|$|E
