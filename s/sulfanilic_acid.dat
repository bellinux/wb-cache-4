40|$|The sulfonation of {{graphene}} by coupling {{with the}} diazonium salts of <b>sulfanilic</b> (SA) <b>acid</b> and amino- 4 -hydroxy- 2 -naphthalenesulfonic (NSA) acid is studied. Coupling with the diazonium salt of NSA gives {{the highest degree}} of sulfonation. Composites of polyaniline (PANI) and sulfonated graphene (SG) are prepared by the polymerization of aniline {{in the presence of}} the SG. The materials have been characterized by Raman, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and cyclic voltammetry. These materials are electrochemically active at pHs close to physiological pH due to the doping of PANI with the sulfonic groups in SG trapped in the polymer.

40|$|Nowadays {{environment}} has {{been suffering from}} the contamination by heavy metals and organic compounds. Modernization, urbanization and industrialization further increase the levels of contamination. In this work, the ability of bacterium CA previously isolated from textile waste water was investigated to tolerate to aluminium, copper, cobalt, zinc and manganese at different concentrations. The MIC {{were found to be}} 400, 200, 40, 60, 300 mg/L, respectively, the growth rate at MIC were 0. 1732, 0. 417, 0. 0885, 0. 2824 and 0. 4046 h- 1, respectively, and the doubling time values at MIC were 4. 005, 1. 66187, 7. 83, 2. 4539 and 1. 7128 h- 1, respectively. Different organic compounds were supplied as sole carbon sources at chemically defined media. The bacterium CA could grow on the CDM provided with casamino acids, casamino acids (as both carbon and nitrogen source), glucose and glycerol with growth rate of 0. 0297, 0. 0317, 0. 04 and 0. 0492 h- 1, respectively. Whereas the bacterium failed to grow when <b>sulfanilic</b> <b>acids,</b> acrylamide and benzene were only source of carbon. Bacterium CA was found to be sensitive to tetracycline hydrochloride and kanamycin sulfate with clear zones of 2. 8 and 2. 6 cm, respectively, while it was resistant to XY- 12 and ampicillin trihydrate. Moreover, bacterium CA was found to be closest with Bacillus thuringiensis with accession number NR_ 102506 via 16 S rRNA gene analysis. In conclusion, bacterium CA was positive to tolerate to heavy metals, results were significant in case of aluminium, manganese and copper. Bacterium CA was able to grow on different organic compounds that indicated the presence of different mechanisms of carbon source up take and metabolism in the bacterium system. The obtained results suggested the bacterium CA could be potentially used for the treatment of wastewater contamination containing heavy metals and organic compounds...|$|R

40|$|Several model {{azo dyes}} are reductively cleaved by growing {{cultures}} of an ascomycete yeast species, Issatchenkia occidentalis. In liquid media containing 0. 2 mM dye and 2 % glucose in a mineral salts base, more than 80 % of the dyes are removed in 15 h, essentially under microaerophilic conditions. Under anoxic conditions, decolorization does not occur, {{even in the}} presence of pregrown cells. Kinetic assays of azo reduction activities in quasi-resting cells demonstrated the following: (i) while the optimum pH depends on dye structure, the optimum pH range was observed in the acidic range; (ii) the maximum decolorizing activity occurs in the late exponential phase; and (iii) the temperature profile approaches the typical bell-shaped curve. These results indirectly suggest the involvement of an enzyme activity in azo dye reduction. The decolorizing activity of I. occidentalis is still observed, although at a lower level, when the cells switch to aerobic respiration at the expense of ethanol after glucose exhaustion in the culture medium. Decolorization ceased when all the ethanol was consumed; this observation, along with other lines of evidence, suggests that azo dye reduction depends on cell growth. Anthraquinone- 2 -sulfonate, a redox mediator, enhances the reduction rates of the N,N-dimethylaniline- based dyes and reduces those of the 2 -naphthol-based dyes, an effect which seems to be compatible with a thermodynamic factor. The dye reduction products were tested as carbon and nitrogen sources. 1 -Amino- 2 -naphthol was used as a carbon and nitrogen source, and N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine was used only as a nitrogen source. <b>Sulfanilic</b> and metanilic <b>acids</b> did not support growth either as a carbon or nitrogen source.
