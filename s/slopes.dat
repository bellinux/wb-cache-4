40|$|<b>Slope</b> {{stability}} issues {{become one}} of the main problems in construction industry due to nature of the topography and the weather conditions in Malaysia. Improper <b>slope</b> analysis design might cause <b>slope</b> failure which has been acknowledged {{as one of the most}} frequent disaster that can lead to great loss of properties and life. To overcome this problem, analysis of <b>slope</b> failure must be carried out to determine the <b>slope</b> stability. This <b>slope</b> failure study has contributed to local engineering studies regarding the <b>slope</b> failure that occurred at Kuala Wau-Kertau road which located in Maran. This study analyses the <b>slope</b> stability and proposes the method of ground improvement to be applied on the <b>slope</b> in term of factor of safety (FOS) and cost. Data from the soil investigation report of the <b>slope</b> is used to analyze the stability of the <b>slope</b> using GeoStudio 2007 Slope/w. From the results, the FOS of the <b>slope</b> before the failure by using Morgenstern-Price Method is 1. 710 which can be considered as stable due to the FOS value is more than 1. According to FOS value, the failure is not due to improper design at the preliminary stages of constructing the road but may be due to other factors. By comparing the analysis of remedial measures to the <b>slope,</b> the best method remedial measure to be applied on the <b>slope</b> in term of FOS value and cost is by using anchors. The FOS value of the <b>slope</b> after applying anchors on the <b>slope</b> increased to 2. 370. The overall estimated cost of applying this method on the <b>slope</b> is about RM 500, 000. The results that have been determined from this study can be made as reference for engineers in order to improve the <b>slope</b> stability of Kuala Wau-Kertau road or any other <b>slope</b> in the future...|$|R

The objective of this work is to study the impacts of a spring grassland fire on vegetation recuperation on an east-facing (A) and a west-facing <b>slope</b> (B), considering fire severity and <b>slope</b> position, 10, 17, 31 and 46 days after the fire. Because of their effects on fire behaviour, aspect, steepness and heterogeneity of topography favoured higher fire severity on <b>slope</b> B than on <b>slope</b> A. Three different <b>slope</b> positions were identified on <b>slope</b> A - flat top, middle <b>slope</b> and flat bottom - and five on <b>slope</b> B - flat top, middle <b>slope,</b> flat middle <b>slope,</b> <b>slope</b> bottom <b>slope</b> and flat bottom. Fire severity was high in top <b>slope</b> positions. The recovery of vegetation was very fast. By the end of the study, vegetation covered nearly 100 % of the study area, although fire severity, aspect and <b>slope</b> characteristics had implications on vegetation recovery. Plant cover recovered quickly on <b>slope</b> A. Ten and 17 days after the fire, plant cover was high in the bottom positions, where fire severity was relatively low.
