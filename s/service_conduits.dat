Electrical breakdown and subsequent arcing occurred repeatedly to create dominant current paths to earth that were not accounted for in pretest linear modeling.

Also surprisingly, strikes to a single grounded protection mast system resulted in internal environments that were generally comparable to those occurring during strikes to roof-mounted air terminals.

However, the development of a number of in vivo and in vitro techniques to more directly evaluate the function of the collecting duct 1 has clearly demonstrated that this segment is not simply a passive conveyor in which water and urea equilibrate with the medullary interstitium, but that it is intimately involved in the regulation of the excretion of sodium and other electrolytes. It is our purpose to summarize the recent findings which have led to this conclusion. These findings have been obtained from studies utilizing the isolated cortical collecting tubule preparation, the in vivo papillary collecting duct technique, end-distal tubule micro-injections, and from comparisons of end-distal delivery and fractional excretion of the electrolyte under study. Although the latter method is indirect and assumes homogeneity of nephron function, it will be noted that data obtained in this manner are in agreement with the results of more direct determinations in virtually each instance...|$|R

40|$|Concrete beam with {{openings}} usually use to provide building <b>services,</b> such as <b>conduits</b> and pipes {{to pass through}} the beam so that the layout on water reticulation and electrical system will be more systematic. It also provide the ease of maintenance on building utility and reduces the financial during construction of high-rise building. However, beam with opening experience great losses of load capacity. In order to regain such losses, the strengthening method is investigated so that the strength of the concrete beam will be able to cover to the maximum. In this study, the behavior of the openings were investigated in terms of load-deflection, crack pattern and stress distribution. The simulation of strengthening concrete beam {{with openings}} by using CFRP laminates were conducted on RC beam with openings. There were three different types of beam that was analyzed in this study, which were solid RC beam, RC beam with openings and the strengthening RC beam with openings by using CFRP laminates. They were modelled using finite element software, ANSYS 12. 0 in three degree of freedom. The location of the openings distinguished into zero distance, 140 mm and 280 mm from the supports. The beams were analyzed under four points loading. The result from numerical analysis was compared with the experimental result. The un-strengthened RC beams were found out that the beam reduced the ultimate load capacity at about 67 – 80 % of the control beam. When the location of the opening was shifted further away from the support, the beam experienced less reduction of the ultimate load of the solid beam. Thus, the critical location of the opening was concluded at the face of the support. However, whenever the CFRP was installed around the opening region. The beam was able to fortify and regained at about 34 – 44 % of ultimate load of the solid beam. Even though the beam was applied with CFRP laminates, they eventually failed on the shear zone. In conclusion, this research was able to prove that the beam was fortified by the CFRP strengthening method. A good agreement between numerical result and experimental result in literature was obtained based on the load-deflection relationship...|$|R
40|$|Abstract of thesis {{entitled}} THE CHARACTER OF PRODUCER SERVICE DEMAND IN MAINLAND CHINA [...] - ITS REPERCUSSION ON HONG KONG’S SERVICE INDUSTRIES Submitted by Chan Tsze-wah, Gabriel For {{the degree}} of Doctor of Philosophy At the University of Hong Kong In February 2016 A common conviction is that Hong Kong’s economic future hinges on its successful integration with Mainland China, but despite Mainland China’s vast increase in national income {{since the beginning of}} the millennium, Hong Kong‘s yearly GDP growth rate has been showing a downward trend. This thesis seeks to uncover the causes for the feebleness of the growth momentum in Hong Kong’s service economy through studying contextually the interactions between Hong Kong’s producer service industries and the demand from the mainland from the beginning of the new century to date. To deepen the understanding of the economic integration process between Hong Kong and Mainland China, in the study, the characteristics of producer service demand and the structural restraints on the demand for knowledge-intensive producer services in the Mainland market are introduced as a critical factor, and focus is also placed on the capabilities of Hong Kong’s producer service providers and whether the city can provide the producer service needs of Mainland China competitively. The thesis finds that the low income elasticities of trade and transport services provided by Hong Kong to the mainland as well as intensive competition from mainland providers in respect of those services, the under-development of demand for knowledge-intensive producer services on the mainland, the city’s weakness in scientific and technological services, the decline in the demand for financial and professional services due to reduction in overseas fund-raising activities by Mainland enterprises, and the general obstructiveness of the Mainland market to Hong Kong service providers have largely constituted the present economic woes of the service economy of Hong Kong. In the long-term, due to the expected progressive enhancement of Mainland China’s competitiveness relative to Hong Kong and the likelihood of the continuation of the present unfriendliness in the Mainland market, there is doubt whether Hong Kong can just rely on the Mainland market to anchor its long-term economic development. The thesis also finds that in Mainland China, there are deep-rooted structural restraints on the development of knowledge-intensive producer <b>services,</b> an effective <b>conduit</b> for the dissemination of knowledge, and the country needs to overcome such restraints in order to enhance the employment of knowledge-intensive producer services so as to increase the knowledge intensity of its production systems and achieve success in its present economic transformation. published_or_final_versionGeographyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Ces dernières années, la problématique de la {{relation}} de <b>service</b> a <b>conduit</b> à l’analyse de situations de travail de plus en plus prégnantes en s’intéressant de très près au déroulement de l’activité. Cette perspective peut être poussée jusqu’à étudier le caractère sollicitant d’une activité fondée sur la confrontation aux clients et les implications de cette sollicitation sur les contraintes ressenties par les salariés dans l’exercice du travail. Il s’agit donc d’examiner les effets de l’organisation de l’activité – y compris les dispositifs de gestion qui y interviennent et l’influence du travail de l’encadrement – à l’égard des contraintes que ressentent les salariés. Cette organisation peut alléger ou renforcer ces contraintes et accentue l’envie des salariés d’en discuter pour adapter les finalités et modalités du travail. Over {{the past}} few years, {{the study of the}} service relationship (that is to say, work place situations dominated by face-to-face contact with the client or the user) has perceptibly renewed the analysis of ongoing shifts in employment and work. This study is broadly based on a very highly detailed observation of occupational activity. In so doing, we were able to bring to light all of the work done by salaried workers who were being confronted by the difficulties which were a part of their work, and were finding solutions, thus focussing attention on the very demanding nature of contemporary work. By using data from a study undertaken in France involving mail distribution services and supermarket departments, the article focuses, from this perspective, on work place tensions {{in the context of the}} service relationship and on the effect that management choices and organization have on these strains. Appearing, with their slogans, to rediscover that they are at the service of their clients and users, businesses and public administrations obligate everyone in their service to subordinate their business activity less to internal constraints and to a higher degree to those of the service recipient. The postal sorting centre actors being studied, and particularly their managers, willingly comply with their administration’s statement that the business’s economic situation and other pressures make it inevitable to have to organize work in a client-centered way. On the other hand, the employees expect to discuss concrete changes and the means of action implied, showing thus the share of the social construction of reality which is involved: for instance, how to organize, to deal with the 5 % of mail which is not distributed in “J+ 1 ”? Wouldn’t it be necessary to have an additional team to deal with it? Does the target of 95 % adequately reflect the complexity of client expectations? Being “in the field,” the operational actors have direct experience with the real customer and a perception of tensions that they would like to express to those who create goals and performance indicators. Indicators inspired by industrial logic do not take into account the complexity of the reality faced by customer service relations employers and their managers, and thus, these indicators give these employees further pressures which are difficult to manage. The fact of placing service work under the tension of the client’s judgment has, from the outset, the effect of making the work process more demanding: one must do one’s work without being able to escape from the client’s presence and his subjectivity. The framework which the supervisor sets up for the activity then has an impact, either in “adding on” in terms of pressures, or, on the other hand, of supporting work. For logistical activities such as mail distribution and supermarket departments, which function under a high degree of time pressure, the client service strategies make the deadline promised to the client even more imperative, and segment the clientele and the types of services provided: in this way, these strategies increase the pressures which are experienced and simultaneously create the desire on the part of the worker to be able to discuss these new pressures. Depending on the case, operational actors within the business manage or not to find the means of organization and management which help them to deal with these pressures. Thus, the head of one of the bakery-pastry departments decides to impose on his work and on his team’s work a very rigid flow, as if the customer orientation or focus could have no other effect but to force each person to work with his “nose to the grindstone. ” His counterpart in another store contradicts this relationship by devoting a great deal of attention to the daily organization of the team’s activity, the division of labour, means of co-ordination (notebooks, etc.). The daily experience of the tensions and demands which weigh upon work appear, in this way, very dependant on organization and on management which either reinforces them or make them less apparent according to whether management provides the rules and the means to deal with these pressures. What organizes work—and influences the perception of demands—is made up of everything which enables individuals and collective groups to equip themselves to confront the action. The collectivity, in itself, more or less helps individuals carry out their work. Evaluation interviews give workers the opportunity to discuss the situation, to inform supervisors if they find anything in the organization that meets management expectations, but, in fact, discussions on the subject of work fall short. Supervisors, themselves, have very few means of gaining recognition for the adjustment carried out under their supervision at the local level, and encounter standardizing logic from service relationship models primarily based on marketing orientations. Estos últimos años, la problemática de la relación de servicio ha conducido al analisis de situaciones de trabajo cada vez mas constrictivas y a interesarse de cerca al desenvolvimiento de la actividad. Esta perspectiva puede conducir al estudio del carácter solicitante de una actividad fundada en la confrontación con los clientes y de las implicaciones de esta solicitud respecto a las coerciones resentidas por los asalariados en el ejercicio del trabajo. Se trata entonces de examinar los efectos de la organización de la actividad - incluyendo los dispositivos de gestión que intervienen y la influencia del trabajo de dirección - respecto a las coerciones resentidas por los asalariados. Esta organización puede aliviar o reforzar estas coerciones y acentúa el deseo de los asalariados de discutir sobre ello para adaptar la finalidad y las modalidades de trabajo...|$|R
