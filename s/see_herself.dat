At Wesley's office, she meets an airline pilot named Carol (Matt Damon). When she learns that Carol is a big fan of The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS), for which Liz is the head writer, she asks Carol to go with her to Cerie's wedding, which he accepts. At Cerie's wedding, Wesley is distraught that Liz ended their engagement through a text message she sent to him. Liz tells him that fate brought them together so that she would meet Carol, with whom she can <b>see</b> <b>herself</b> spending the rest of her life. Wesley is devastated and leaves. Unbeknownst to Liz, Carol, who Liz thought had stepped out from the party area, heard everything she told Wesley, which shocks Carol, prompting him to leave. At the same time, at Cerie's wedding, Nancy learns that Avery is pregnant after having a conversation with her in the ladies room, and tells Jack before she leaves him. When Jack finds Avery, he tells her he wants to marry her, which she accepts.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the turn}} of the millennium, the {{combination}} of hard and fast guitar riffs with classical female lead vocals attracted {{a great deal of attention}} in the metal scene. The new music style of Nightwish quickly achieved critical and commercial popularity; this symphonic metal style was soon dubbed [...] "opera metal". Turunen does not <b>see</b> <b>herself</b> as an opera singer. She has sung excerpts from operas at the Savonlinna Opera Festival, but she stresses that singing opera cannot be performed as a side project. She would need special training to perfectly sing an entire opera without a microphone.|$|E
500|$|After Carey Lowell {{was chosen}} to play Pam Bouvier, she watched many of the films in the series for inspiration. Lowell had {{described}} becoming a Bond girl as [...] "huge shoes to fill", as she did not <b>see</b> <b>herself</b> as a [...] "glamour girl", even coming to audition {{in jeans and a}} leather jacket. While Lowell wore a wig for the scenes set in the United States, a scene where Bouvier is given money and told by Bond to go and buy some new clothes (and, going off and doing so, also has her hair cut) was added so that Lowell's own short hair style could be used.|$|E

500|$|Though Lawson {{has enjoyed}} a {{successful}} career in cookery, {{she is not a}} trained chef, and does not like being referred to as a [...] "celebrity chef". Furthermore, she does not <b>see</b> <b>herself</b> as a cook or an expert in her field. Throughout Lawson's television programmes, she emphasises that she cooks for her own pleasure, for enjoyment, and that she finds cooking therapeutic. When deciding upon which recipes to feature in her books, she takes the view of the eater, stating, [...] "If it's something I don't want to carry on eating once I'm full, then I don't want the recipe ... I have to feel that I want to cook the thing again".|$|E
500|$|Sevigny {{has only}} had {{long-term}} relationships with men, though in 2006 she stated to the New York Post Gossip column: [...] "I've questioned issues {{of gender and}} sexuality since I was a teenager, and I did some experimenting." [...] In a later interview, she stated that she [...] "wouldn't call herself bisexual," [...] and that she could never <b>see</b> <b>herself</b> {{in a relationship with}} a woman. Nonetheless, she has been popular with the gay community throughout her career. Following her on and off relationship with Harmony Korine, which ended in the late 1990s, Sevigny dated British musician Jarvis Cocker, and later Matt McAuley, a member of the noise-rock band A.R.E. Weapons. Sevigny and McAuley ended their eight-year relationship in early 2008.|$|E

2500|$|Chytilová {{is cited}} as a militant feminist filmmaker. [...] Josef Škvorecký states that Chytilová “In a true feminist {{tradition}} Vera combined intensive intellectual effort with a feminine feeling for beauty and form”. [...] Daises {{is seen as a}} feminist film due to its attitude and active critique of male attitudes towards sex. However Chytilová did not <b>see</b> <b>herself</b> as a feminist filmmaker, but rather believes in individualism, stating that if a person does not believe in a particular set of conventions or rules then it is up to that individual to break them.|$|E

During her recovery, she started to consider a career as a medical illustrator, which would combine her interests in science and art, and began to paint. She had a specially-made easel that enabled her to paint in bed, and a mirror was placed above it so she could <b>see</b> <b>herself.</b> [...] Painting became a way for Kahlo to explore questions of identity and existence, and she later stated that the accident and the isolating recovery period made her desire, [...] "to begin again, painting things just as I saw them with my own eyes and nothing more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Onerva's {{literary}} {{career began}} when she sent {{some of her}} poems to be evaluated by Maila Talvio in 1899. Talvio did not <b>see</b> <b>herself</b> as apt to review them and introduced Onerva to [...] to ask for his comments on her poetry. Erkko mentored her, gave her writing tips and {{tried to find a}} publisher for her. She also gave her her future pen name [...] "L. Onerva". Although they could not find a publisher for her, they managed to publish some of her poems in a winter album entitled Nuori Suomi ("Yong Finland"). Onerva's first poetry collection, Sekasointuja, was published in 1904 with the help of [...] The poems in the collection were written by Onerva mainly between 1900 and 1903. The collection was well-received by both critics and readers. Young readers were particularly attracted by its boldness and unconventional nature.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the novel}} Hilde will often {{not refer to}} herself in the first person, but insists on using the third person, or she speaks without using a noun or pronoun. This relates to her self-loathing and her unwillingness to <b>see</b> <b>herself</b> {{honestly}} for fear of who she really is. Similar to the disuse of the pronoun [...] "I", Hilde also does not allow herself {{to use the word}} [...] "my" [...] in reference to her parents, husband, and daughter. She inserts an impersonal [...] "the" [...] in its place. For example, she does not say [...] "my" [...] mother, but [...] "the" [...] mother. In the original Austrian text the use of the impersonal article was meant to show estrangement between Hilde and her family, and Reichart asked that the English translation retain the article even though it did not translate directly.|$|E

2500|$|Cheryl Anderson, in {{her book}} Ancient Laws and Contemporary Controversies: The Need for Inclusive Bible Interpretation, {{discusses}} an anecdote about a student, who, when exposed to the passages in Deuteronomy, said that [...] "This is the word of God. If it says slavery is okay, slavery is okay. If it says rape is okay, rape is okay." [...] Elaborating on this, she states {{in response to these}} passages, [...] "Clearly, these laws do {{not take into account the}} female's perspective. After a rape, [...] would undoubtedly <b>see</b> <b>herself</b> as the injured party and would probably find marriage to her rapist to be distasteful, to say the least. Arguably, there are cultural and historical reasons why such a law made sense at the time. [...] Just the same, the law communicates the message that faith tradition does not (and should not) consider the possibility that women might have different yet valid perspectives." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{also paid}} tribute to the poet Luigi Alamanni, who took refuge in France after a {{conspiracy}} against Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, later Pope Clement VII. She writes about her [...] "pitiful end" [...] (miserando fine) and [...] "now that I feel my bitter end near" [...] (or ch’io sento da presso il fine amaro), which leads one to think {{she was aware of}} her imminent murder, or perhaps waiting for the natural course of her sad existence. In the last compositions she finds consolation in Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary, through whom she seems to have finally accepted her painful existence and tried to find peace of mind, apparently reconciling herself to the land she once despised. Her final hope is to <b>see</b> <b>herself</b> [...] "totally freed from the stormy terrestrial cloud, and among the blessed souls" [...] (sgombrata tutta dal terrestre nembo, e fra l’alme beate).|$|E

She reported sometimes watching herself move from above but remained aware of her unmoving [...] "real" [...] body. The participant reported no particular emotions linked to the experience. [...] "he brain functional changes associated with the reported extra-corporeal experience (ECE) were different than those observed in motor imagery. Activations were mainly left-sided and involved the left supplementary motor area and supramarginal and posterior superior temporal gyri, the last two overlapping with the temporal parietal junction that has been associated with out-of-body experiences. The cerebellum also showed activation that is consistent with the participant’s report of the impression of movement during the ECE. There was also left middle and superior orbital frontal gyri activity, regions often associated with action monitoring." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Moon by Night (1963, [...] ) rejoins Vicky when, {{at the age}} of fourteen, {{she begins}} to attract the {{attention}} of teenage boys, and her life is disrupted yet again as Maggy moves away and the family prepares to move into a New York City apartment. Having grown up outside the fictional village of Thornhill, Connecticut, Vicky is unhappy and uncomfortable with the move to the big city. [...] As her parents soften the blow by taking the family on a ten-week cross-country camping trip, Vicky meets Zachary Gray, a handsome, charming, mercurial boy who sweeps her off her feet. He follows her around the country, leaving notes and on occasion going sightseeing with the Austins. Later in the trip, Zachary has a rival with Andy Ford, who is more stable and dependable than Zach - and therefore less exciting. Vicky also struggles with her own identity issues as she begins to <b>see</b> <b>herself</b> as an individual, not just a member of the family. She is concerned about her developing looks and is even more concerned about her developing personality. Although some of her concerns are eased by Uncle Douglass in California, Vicky remains doubtful of her true identity and maturity throughout the novel.|$|E
2500|$|Bishop did not <b>see</b> <b>herself</b> as a [...] "lesbian poet" [...] or as a [...] "female poet". Because {{she refused}} to have her work {{published}} in all-female poetry anthologies, other female poets involved with the women's movement thought she was hostile towards the movement. For instance, a student at Harvard who was close to Bishop in the 60s, Kathleen Spivack, wrote in her memoir, [...] "I think Bishop internalized the misogyny of the time. How could she not? ... Bishop had a very ambivalent relation to being a woman plus poet—plus lesbian—in the Boston/Cambridge/Harvard nexus ... Extremely vulnerable, sensitive, she hid much of her private life. She {{wanted nothing to do}} with anything that seemed to involve the women's movement. She internalized many of the male attitudes of the day toward women, who were supposed to be attractive, appealing to men, and not ask for equal pay or a job with benefits." [...] However, this was not how Bishop necessarily viewed herself. In an interview with The Paris Review from 1978, she said that, despite her insistence on being excluded from female poetry anthologies, she still considered herself to be [...] "a strong feminist" [...] but that she only wanted to be judged based on the quality of her writing and not on her gender or sexual orientation.|$|E
2500|$|Following her divorce, Jackson {{decided to}} record an uptempo, optimistic album rather than songs about sadness or anger. Producer Jimmy Jam said, [...] "You {{go through all}} these {{emotions}} and then {{you come out of}} it {{on the other side and}} say, [...] "I'm going to be okay and I have a lot of things to be thankful for,' and that was the overriding feeling in her life when we were making this album." [...] Its concept focuses largely on the demise of her marriage to René Elizondo, Jr. and subsequent embrace of the single life, experiencing dating for the first time. It also contains themes of sensuality, deceit, and betrayal. Jackson said, [...] "It’s a different thing for me. Growing up, I never dated. I’m doing that now, experiencing that whole life." [...] Its upbeat tempo intended to reflect Jackson's self-esteem, described as [...] "a work in progress." [...] Jam commented, [...] "She doesn't <b>see</b> <b>herself</b> the way other people see her. You know...gorgeous and sexy and all that. That isn't the kind of person she is. Although she is closer to feeling like that person now than she was 15 years ago. Or even three of four years ago." [...] Jackson commented, [...] "I look back at pictures of myself from four years ago and I see the unhappiness in my eyes. But I'm in the greatest space now... I believe we have choices and paths, and it's about choosing the right path, the promising path." [...] While recording, Jackson listened to artists such as St. Germain, Buena Vista Social Club, Thievery Corporation, Basement Jaxx, Outkast and Papa Roach.|$|E

5000|$|The strip often {{shows an}} {{alternate}} {{point of view}} based on the characters' fantasies. Rose often <b>sees</b> <b>herself</b> as a biker chick {{when faced with a}} conflict between selfish desire and social obligations, or when confronted with challenges to her usually mild-mannered personality. On the rare occasions when she and Jimbo are fighting, she usually <b>sees</b> <b>herself</b> locked away as a prisoner in a [...] "dungeon of resentment." [...] Jimbo, who would like his wife to gain weight, sometimes fantasizes about her being plump and round-faced. Pasquale's [...] "dream ship" [...] sequences get much play, as does his relationship with his beloved guardian angel or the bathtub's dreaded drain monster. Even Peekaboo has elaborate fantasies.|$|R
