5|$|In {{northern}} France, men {{and resources}} were being marshalled {{in preparation for}} the large British-French <b>Somme</b> Offensive. The build-up in the <b>Somme</b> did not go unnoticed by the German Supreme Army Command. The German Second Army, which was holding the sector north of the <b>Somme,</b> had observed preparations for an offensive since the end of February 1916. Short of resources due to operations at Verdun, the Germans could only mount local operations in an effort to divert British resources from the <b>Somme.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{that battle}} on the <b>Somme</b> dragged on, the Canadian Corps {{was brought up}} and the AIF was {{withdrawn}} from the line to re-organise and reform, having suffered almost 23,000 casualties {{over the course of}} the 45 days that they had been involved. The 5th Division had been so badly mauled, having been incapacitated by the losses they had suffered at Fromelles, that it was not until October that the 5th Division finally returned to the line and joined the 1st, 2nd and 4th Divisions on the <b>Somme</b> near Flers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century the area around the mouth of the River <b>Somme</b> was {{considered}} a paradise for hunters interested in wildfowl. Because of quarantine restrictions in the United Kingdom, British shooters would board their dogs in the Picardy area, near the mouth of the <b>Somme.</b> This caused the infusion of English Setter blood into the local Spaniel population and developed the Blue Picardy Spaniel.|$|E

5|$|In March 1918 the Germans {{launched}} their Spring Offensive near Saint-Quentin {{and as the}} Allied line collapsed, the German forces advanced swiftly into the <b>Somme</b> valley. Believing that another attack would be directed against the forces in the Flanders sector, {{in an effort to}} reinforce the British forces there, the Allied commanders recalled the 3rd Division was recalled from its quiet sector around Armentières and sent it to Ypres. The attack came, however, at the <b>Somme</b> and so on 24 March the division was transferred south to help stem the advance and defend the approaches towards the important railhead at Amiens. Temporarily placed under the command of the British VII Corps, the division took up position to the east of Amiens in between the Ancre and <b>Somme</b> Rivers.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the <b>Somme</b> was the regiment's {{first major}} engagement, and during an assault that lasted {{approximately}} 30 minutes the regiment {{was all but}} wiped out.

Along with preserved trench lines, {{there are a number of}} memorials and cemeteries contained within the site.|$|E

5|$|The New Zealand Division {{continued}} to man its trenches along its {{section of the}} <b>Somme</b> front and regularly mounted trench raids. To the amusement of the New Zealanders, the German soldiers manning the trenches opposite were warned to avoid being captured because they might be eaten. In June, the division was withdrawn to Authie. The New Zealanders returned to the <b>Somme</b> front in early July, and settled into a sector east of Hébuterne that included Rossignol Wood. As with the division's previous stint on the <b>Somme,</b> trench raids were often carried out. During a raid mounted on 23 July, Sergeant Richard Travis performed actions {{that led to a}} posthumous award of the VC; he was killed the next day. A prominent soldier and renowned for his scouting skills, his death was mourned across the division.|$|E

5|$|During 10–11 June 1916, the {{division}} was relieved by the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division {{and moved into}} reserve. It then moved south and joined XVII Corps of the Third Army to train for the Battle of the <b>Somme.</b> New trenches were dug and {{the division}} made practice attacks on them using novel tactics: attacking in waves in conjunction with artillery and machine gun fire. Towards {{the end of the}} month, the division moved further south to the <b>Somme</b> valley. They then joined II Corps and were placed in reserve. The role of the division was as a second wave to exploit the expected success. After the breach of the German lines, the Reserve Army cavalry divisions would capture Bapaume. The 38th (Welsh) Division would then move forward to relieve the cavalry and secure the town, to allow the cavalry to advance north towards Arras.|$|E
