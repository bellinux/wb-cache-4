5000|$|While phonesthemes {{have mostly}} been {{identified}} in the onsets of words and syllables, they can have other forms. There has been some argument that sequences like [...] "-ash" [...] and [...] "-ack" [...] in English also <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> phonesthemes, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their patterning in words that denote forceful, destructive contact ("smash", [...] "crash", [...] "bash", etc.) and abrupt contact ("smack", [...] "whack", [...] "crack", etc.), respectively.|$|R

One of his descendants, Agar Sen {{acquired}} large {{territory in the}} reign of Emperor Jehangir and was bestowed the title of 'Raja' by Emperor Shah Jahan. In 1659, he was succeeded by his son Raja Guj Singh, who built the palace of the family at Bettiah. He died in 1694 A.D. The palace stands today but <b>serves</b> <b>as</b> marketplace <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the neglect of authorities.|$|R
5000|$|The first issue, {{published}} on 26 September 1946, was in French. It featured Hergé, Jacobs, Paul Cuvelier and Jacques Laudy as artists, with their mutual friend Jacques Van Melkebeke <b>serving</b> <b>as</b> editor. (<b>Due</b> <b>to</b> suspicions of incivism {{left over from}} the war, Van Melkebeke was forced to step down as editor soon after.) A Dutch edition, entitled Kuifje, was published simultaneously (Kuifje being the name of the eponymous character Tintin in Dutch). 40,000 copies were released in French, and 20,000 in Dutch.|$|R

50|$|After {{lessons learned}} from combat {{experiences}} involving modern military air capacity, the U.S. Navy's VFAX/VFX and U.S. Air Force's F-X (Fighter Experimental) reassessed their tactical direction {{which resulted in the}} U.S. Navy's F-14 Tomcat and US Air Force's F-15 Eagle. The two designs were built to achieve air superiority and significant consideration was given during the development of both aircraft to allow them to excel at the shorter ranges of fighter combat. Both aircraft also <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> interceptors <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their high maximum speed.|$|R
50|$|The {{praying mantid}} Empusa fasciata has a {{tapering}} {{head with a}} miter-like helmet, oval compound eyes, slender raptorial forelegs and a long thin thorax. E. fasciata often bends sharply upward at the abdomen, making the thorax appear even longer. The ventral abdomen and the femurs of the long thin walking legs have distinct lobules, which <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> camouflage. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> its bizarre shape and the yellowish-green striped pattern of the legs, E. fasciata is well-camouflaged in vegetation, and is noticeable only when in motion.|$|R
5000|$|Hao Chujun ( [...] ; 607-681), {{formally}} Duke of Zengshan (甑山公), was {{an official}} and {{general of the}} Chinese Tang Dynasty, <b>serving</b> <b>as</b> chancellor {{during the reign of}} Emperor Gaozong. He was known for his honesty and willingness to advise Emperor Gaozong against actions he considered unwise. One advice he gave, however (against Emperor Gaozong's plan to let his powerful wife Empress Wu (later known <b>as</b> Wu Zetian) <b>serving</b> <b>as</b> regent <b>due</b> <b>to</b> Emperor Gaozong's illness), drew Empress Wu's resentment, and later, after she became regent over her son Emperor Ruizong after Emperor Gaozong and Hao had both died, she had Hao's clan slaughtered.|$|R

30|$|Many {{microbial}} polysaccharides <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> emulsifiers <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{their ability}} to stabilise emulsions between water and hydrophobic compounds. When compared with the chemically derived compounds, the bacterial exopolymeric substances {{were found to be}} stable in extreme conditions like temperature, pH and salinity (Banat et al. 2000). Hence, an interest has been focused towards the production of biologically derived compounds. Bio-emulsifiers are essential in the formation and stabilisation of emulsion. It reduces the surface tension of oil and water interface by forming a protective layer around emulsion droplets and blocks coalescence by adsorbing with the oil/water interface.|$|R

50|$|The SVZ is a known site of {{neurogenesis}} and self-renewing neurons in {{the adult}} brain, <b>serving</b> <b>as</b> such <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the interacting cell types, extracellular molecules, and localized epigenetic regulation promoting such cellular proliferation. Along with the subgranular zone of dentate gyrus, the subventricular zone <b>serves</b> <b>as</b> a source of neural stem cells(NSCs) {{in the process of}} adult neurogenesis. It harbors the largest population of proliferating cells {{in the adult}} brain of rodents, monkeys and humans. In 2010, it was shown that the balance between neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) is maintained by an interaction between the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway and the Notch signaling pathway.|$|R
50|$|Horlock {{joined the}} Royal Field Artillery {{as a regular}} soldier before the First World War and for an unknown reason <b>served</b> <b>as</b> Harlock, {{possibly}} <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a clerical error on enlistment papers and subsequent records. His Victoria Cross was actually correctly engraved Horlock. His grave at Hadra Military Cemetery, Alexandria, bore the name Harlock until corrected by the Commonwealth Graves Commission in the late 1970s.|$|R
50|$|In {{practice}} a maximum temperature resistance (about 260 °C) {{can be obtained}} with fluoropolymers (polymers, in which the hydrogen atoms of the hydrocarbons {{have been replaced by}} fluorine atoms). Among them, PTFE has the largest market share with 65-70 %. Fluorine-containing polymers are, however, not suitable <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> construction material <b>due</b> <b>to</b> poor mechanical properties (low strength and stiffness, strong creep under load).|$|R
50|$|The jinkai {{served a}} similar {{function}} to drums and bells in signaling troop formations, setting a rhythm for marching, providing {{something of a}} heroic accompaniment to encourage the troops and confusing the enemy by inferring that the troop numbers were large enough to require such trumpeters. Many daimyōs (feudal lords) enlisted yamabushi <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> kai yaku, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their experience with the instrument.|$|R
40|$|Twenty-seven Hereford steer calves {{were divided}} as equally as {{possible}} into three lots of 9 animals each. One lot received stilbestrol {{at the rate}} of 6 milligrams per head daily for the first 56 days. The rate was increased to 10 milligrams per head daily {{for the remainder of the}} test. Previous work indicated a lower level for young calves might be more desirable during the first part of the feeding period. The other two lots <b>served</b> <b>as</b> controls. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> lack of pen 'space, they were fed together. All animals will graze bromegrass pasture without stilbestrol this summer. After returning to the feed lot, all animals accept one control lot will receive stilbestrol in the fattening ration...|$|R
30|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{concentrations of}} the (P)HCA in the supernatants {{were determined by}} ion exclusion chromatography. A Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA) DX- 500 system was used equipped with an isocratic high pressure pump IP 20, a Dionex IonPac HPICE-AS 6 separation column, and a Shimadzu (Duisburg, Germany) SPD 10 AVP UV/VIS detector, wavelength set to 210  nm. 0.55  mmol L− 1 H 2 SO 4 <b>served</b> <b>as</b> eluent. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> the fast lactonization of GLU under that conditions, the GLU signal corresponded mainly to the lactone form of the analyte. Equal lactonization degrees of the GLU calibration standard and of GLU containing samples were implied for identical analytical treatments. The sorbed amounts of (P)HCA were calculated from the difference between initial and equilibrium concentrations in solution.|$|R

Although as a university graduate he should have <b>served</b> <b>as</b> an officer, he <b>served</b> <b>as</b> a private <b>due</b> <b>to</b> his record of political activity. After {{the end of his}} service, he went to work in the Behshahr cooking oil company. In 1967, he took a position as an intern in a legal office.|$|R
50|$|The Woodbury Country Club (WCC) was {{a private}} golf club in Woodbury, New Jersey, United States. It was {{incorporated}} in August 1897 and {{had been one of}} the 100 oldest private golf clubs in the country as of August 2009. Among some of the club's original officers was George Gill Green, a patent medicine entrepreneur, who <b>served</b> <b>as</b> Vice President. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> the economy, the golf club was no longer able to sustain operations and went into foreclosure in 2010.|$|R
50|$|John Russell {{was born}} on 10 December 1842 at Chesham Place, London, the first son of Lord John Russell, himself {{the son of the}} 6th Duke of Bedford. His mother was Lord Russell's second wife, Lady Frances, {{daughter}} of the 2nd Earl of Minto. In 1846, his father became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and <b>served</b> <b>as</b> such twice. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> Lord John's elevation to peerage as Earl Russell in 1861, his son and heir apparent became known as Viscount Amberley.|$|R
5000|$|A {{few months}} later after her husband became president, she joined him in the White House, {{but she was not}} able <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> First Lady <b>due</b> <b>to</b> her poor health from tuberculosis. She {{remained}} confined to her bedroom there, leaving the social chores to her daughter Martha Johnson Patterson. [...] Mrs. Johnson appeared publicly as First Lady on only two occasions—at a reception for Queen Emma of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1866 and at the president's birthday party in 1867.|$|R
5000|$|When his {{grandfather}} Valdemar IV of Denmark died, Olaf was {{just five years}} old. He was proclaimed King of Denmark by a Danehof in Slagelse the following year. His mother, Queen Margaret, was <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> regent <b>due</b> <b>to</b> his young age. His proclamation included the title [...] "true heir of Sweden" [...] added at his mother's insistence since {{his grandfather}} had been king of Sweden until forced to abdicate. Olaf was hailed as king in Scania, including the towns controlled by the Hanseatic league since the Treaty of Stralsund in 1370. Queen Margaret signed a coronation charter on behalf of Olaf who {{was too young to}} rule until he came of age at fifteen. In the charter Olaf agreed to meet with the Danehof {{at least once a year}} and return properties his grandfather Valdemar IV had confiscated during his reign.|$|R
50|$|The 46th Arkansas Infantry (Mounted) (1864-1865) was a Confederate Army Mounted Infantry {{regiment}} {{during the}} American Civil War. While {{authorized by the}} State Military Board as an infantry regiment, the unit was mounted for Price's Missouri Expedition and <b>served</b> <b>as</b> mounted infantry. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> its mounted status, the unit is {{sometimes referred to as}} the 46th Arkansas Cavalry when a numerical designation is used. The unit is almost always referred to as either Coleman's Arkansas Cavalry Regiment or Crabtree's Cavalry in official reports from the period.|$|R
50|$|However, being a {{national}} school that draws students {{from all over}} the country, Alliance High School has a small population of non-Christian students, mostly Muslims. These students have the liberty to practise their faith. When the Christian students attend the daily morning chapel service, Muslim students congregate separately to carry out a religious service of their own. Although there is no permanent mosque in the school, there is always a room set aside that <b>serves</b> <b>as</b> a mosque. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> Islamic Sharia dietary requirements, Muslim students have separate tables in the dining hall.|$|R
50|$|The {{entry of}} Viettel also saw further {{liberalization}} {{of the communication}} sector, where the government allowed private companies to lay their own optic fiber cables. The company had promised to connect several public institutions around {{the country with the}} optic fibre network and connect over 1500 villages to the telecommunication grid that were previously not served. The company also tried to partner with state-owned energy company Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO) to use TANESCO's power poles <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> antennas, however <b>due</b> <b>to</b> high costs the plan was abandoned.|$|R
50|$|On February 7, 1910, Shaw was {{appointed}} titular bishop of Castabala and coadjutor {{bishop of the}} Diocese of San Antonio in Texas by Pope Pius X. He received his episcopal consecration on the following April 14 from Archbishop James Blenk, S.M., with Bishops Edward Patrick Allen and Cornelius Van de Ven <b>serving</b> <b>as</b> co-consecrators. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> the declining health of Bishop John Anthony Forest, he was made apostolic administrator of the diocese on May 18, 1910. Upon Forest's death on March 11, 1911, Shaw succeeded him as the fourth Bishop of San Antonio. His efforts to provide relief to Mexican refugees in Texas caused the Archbishop of Mexico City to make Shaw an honorary canon of the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe. In 1915, he opened St. John's Seminary in his personal residence. While in San Antonio, he also restored and reopened several historic Spanish missions.|$|R
40|$|For {{estimation}} of wheat end-product quality during wheat breeding programs composition of high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW GS) {{and the presence}} of 1 BL/ 1 RS translations <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> markers <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their profound effects on dough elasticity and viscous properties. Ninety-three wheat genotypes from Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops in Novi Sad have been analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in order to determine their HMW GS composition and 1 BL/ 1 RS translocation presence. Eleven alleles were found at the Glu- 1 loci. Subunits 1 and 2 *and the null allele N were determined at the Glu-A 1 locus. Subunitis 7, 7 + 9, 7 + 8, 6 + 8, 20 and 21 were found at the Glu-B 1 locus, subunits 2 + 12 and 5 + 10 at the Glu-D 1 locus. The 1 BL/ 1 RS translocation was discovered in 28 cultivars, although three of them were heterogeneous...|$|R
