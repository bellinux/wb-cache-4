The [...] "long, daunting hours" [...] on the writer's room would sometimes lead to creating episodes of the fictional show, with ten being done when the Nikki-centered episode was written. Originally, {{there was going to be}} an entire flashback episode in which Nikki was going to be a crime-fighting stripper, only to have it revealed that she was actually an actress. The idea was shortened to just one flashback spot. The role of Mr. LaShade was written with Billy Dee Williams in mind and, when he was cast, the color <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> LaShade's <b>hat</b> was chosen in reference to his costume worn in his famed role as Lando Calrissian [...]|$|R

500|$|As a subsidiary, International Hat {{continued}} operation until June 14, 1989. [...] The domestic hat apparel market {{had undergone a}} steady increase in global competition since the 1970s {{during a time of}} record sales <b>of</b> <b>hats</b> in the US. [...] The company was pressured by changing market conditions, particularly the US loss of market share from cheaper imports coming in from Brazil, Spain, Taiwan, and China. [...] In 1984, China alone exported 2.98 million dozens <b>of</b> <b>hats</b> to the United States. [...] By 1989, 6.5 million dozens <b>of</b> <b>hats</b> were being imported from China, representing 31 percent of the total market share <b>of</b> the <b>hat</b> apparel industry. [...] Demand for hats actually increased during this period, whereas the US market share <b>of</b> <b>hats</b> decreased from 27.1 percent to 22.2 percent from 1984 to 1989.|$|R

For cache efficiency, the entire set of equations is solved along pencils in the yz-plane. The advantage of solving for the magnetic vector potential is highlighted.

40|$|The maize {{transposon}} Activator (Ac) was {{the first}} mobile DNA element to be discovered. Since then, other elements were found that share similarity to Ac, suggesting that it belongs to a transposon superfamily named hAT after hobo from Drosophila, Ac from maize, and Tam 3 from snapdragon. We addressed the structure and evolution <b>of</b> <b>hAT</b> elements by developing new tools for transposon mining and searching the public sequence databases for the hallmarks <b>of</b> <b>hAT</b> elements, namely the transposase and short terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) flanked by 8 -bp host duplications. We found 147 hAT-related sequences in plants, animals, and fungi. Six conserved blocks could be identified in the transposase <b>of</b> most <b>hAT</b> elements. A total <b>of</b> 41 <b>hAT</b> sequences were flanked by TIRs and 8 -bp host duplications and, out of these, 34 sequences had TIRs similar to the consensus determined in this work, suggesting that they are active or recently active transposons. Phylogenetic analysis and clustering <b>of</b> <b>hAT</b> sequences suggest that the hAT superfamily is very ancient, probably predating the plant-fungi-animal separation, and that, unlike previously proposed, {{there is no evidence}} that horizontal gene transfer was involved in the evolution <b>of</b> <b>hAT</b> elements...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHistone {{acetylation}} {{is one of}} the key regulatory mechanisms controlling transcriptional {{activity in}} eukaryotic cells. In higher eukaryotes, a number of nuclear histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymes have been identified, most of which are part of a large multisubunit complex. This diversity, combined with the large number of potentially acetylable lysines on histones, suggested the existence of a specific regulatory mechanism based on the substrate specificity <b>of</b> <b>HATs.</b> Over the past decade, intensive characterisations <b>of</b> the <b>HAT</b> complexes have been carried out. However, the precise mode <b>of</b> action <b>of</b> <b>HATs,</b> and particularly the functional differences amongst these complexes, remains elusive. Here we review current insights into the functional role <b>of</b> <b>HATs,</b> focusing on the specificity of their action. Studies based on biochemical as well as genetic approaches suggested that HATs exert a high degree of specificity in their acetylation spectra and in the cellular processes they regulate. However, a different view emerged recently from genomic approaches that provided genome-wide maps <b>of</b> <b>HAT</b> recruitments. The careful analysis of genomic data suggests that all HAT complexes would be simultaneously recruited to a similar set of loci in the genome, arguing for a low specificity in their function. In this review, we discuss the significance of these apparent contradictions and suggest a new model that integrates biochemical, genetic and genome-wide data to better describe the functional specificity <b>of</b> <b>HAT</b> complexes...|$|R

5000|$|The {{catalytic}} activity <b>of</b> <b>HATs</b> is regulated by {{two types of}} mechanisms: (1) interaction with regulatory protein subunits and (2) autoacetylation. [...] A given HAT may be regulated in multiple ways, and the same effector may actually lead to different outcomes under different conditions. [...] Although {{it is clear that}} the association <b>of</b> <b>HATs</b> with multiprotein complexes provides a mechanism for the regulation <b>of</b> both <b>HAT</b> activity and substrate specificity in vivo, the molecular basis for how this actually occurs is still largely unknown. [...] However, data suggests that associated subunits may contribute to catalysis at least in part by facilitating productive binding <b>of</b> the <b>HAT</b> complex to its native histone substrates.|$|R
