Before the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>Project</b> Vista, DuBridge thought that only 50 scientists with half from Caltech would be necessary.

50|$|Building this {{wind farm}} was an {{initiative}} of Eneco and Econcern. Upon completion, Eneco CEO Jeroen de Haas {{complained that the}} required procedures took seven years. By contrast, it only took two years to actually build. Project manager Bernard van Hemert stated that the long delay to obtain approval led to the project using a model of wind turbine (the Vestas V80-2MW) which was state-of-the-art at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>project</b> planning, but no longer the largest-capacity wind turbine on the market {{by the time of}} construction. (For example, the Thorntonbank Wind Farm off the adjacent Belgian coast uses larger 5 MW wind turbines from REpower.) However, the V80-2MW is considered a proven design with over 2700 units installed globally by 2008, thereby reducing the project risks.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the number}} of trace {{requests}} from Mexico has increased since FY 2006, most seized guns in Mexico are not traced. [...] Moreover, most trace requests from Mexico do not succeed in identifying the gun dealer who originally sold the gun, {{and the rate of}} successful traces has declined since the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>Project</b> Gunrunner. Most Mexican crime gun trace requests that were successful were untimely and of limited use for generating investigative leads. The average age of traced Mexican guns is 14 years, and over 75 percent of traced Mexican guns were over five years old and the information considered useless for law enforcement purposes. Senior Mexican law enforcement authorities interviewed by U.S. OIG officers do not view gun tracing as an important investigative tool because it implicates only the innocent and legitimate parties in the gun production and distribution network, due to limitations in the information tracing typically provides. [...] It {{is important to note that}} Mexican law enforcement has no jurisdiction in the United States.|$|E

Pallikaranai has an average literacy rate of 74%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 80%, and female literacy is 67%. In Pallikaranai, 13% of the population is under 6 years of age. Pallikaranai area contains several water bodies and many lakes and is also the home for the reputed National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), which is the real technical arm under Govt of India. This institute has developed In-house Desalination Plant at Kavaratti under Mr Robert Singh and Dr Kathiroli. There are also many temples, parks and schools. In July 2011, Pallikaranai was joined with the Corporation of Chennai. A central grant for sewage system construction in Pallikaranai is awarded to State Government of Tamil Nadu under JnNURM scheme for which the tender and construction is expected to complete by February 2013. The effectiveness of the new sewage scheme is still in question due to the substandard contract approvals and usage of low quality construction materials. Most of the streets report damages to the underground laid sewage clay pipes and soil sinking. Way back from the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>project</b> in 2009, most of the street roads in Pallikaranai are damaged for laying sewage pipes and then left untarred causing inconvenience for transportation.|$|E
