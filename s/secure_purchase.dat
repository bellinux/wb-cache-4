40|$|Ankle {{fractures}} in adults are usually managed by open reduction internal fixation. In elderly patients the surgical dilemma relates to bone quality. Osteoporosis {{is the enemy}} of internal fixation, and <b>secure</b> <b>purchase</b> of screws in osteopenic bone {{may be difficult to}} achieve. Insufficient screw purchase may lead to loss of reduction, wound breakdown, and infection. Postoperative management after osteosynthesis usually requires an extended period of restricted weight bearing. However, this is not feasible in older patients {{as a result of their}} lack of strength in the upper extremities and frequent comorbidities. Therefore, augmen- ted methods of internal fixation and specific surgical techniques have been developed using metal and bone cement. This permits this fragile population to begin early full weight bearing in a removable brace...|$|E
30|$|Two Kirschner wires {{of equal}} {{diameter}} are selected {{depending on the}} body weight of the child (1.5 -mm diameter if the body weight is less than 15 kg, and 1.8 or 2  mm if over 15 kg). The first wire is passed from posterolateral corner of the lateral condyle, across the fracture site in the oblique direction, and proceeds proximally to gain the purchase in the anteromedial metaphyseal cortex. The second wire starts from the anteromedial corner of the medial epicondyle, crosses the lateral wire above the fracture site, and runs proximally to engage the posterolateral metaphyseal cortex. Thus, a biplanar crossed pin construct is achieved {{not only in the}} coronal plane but also in the sagittal plane (Figs. 1 and 2). Every effort is made to get this construct right at the very first attempt. Repeated attempts of pin insertion are avoided. The drilling pace of the power tool is reduced once the resistance of the opposite metaphyseal cortex is met and the <b>secure</b> <b>purchase</b> of the far cortex is achieved. Overshooting of the wires into the soft tissues is avoided. The injured elbow is kept in full flexion for lateral pin fixation and in 60 °– 70 ° of flexion for medial wire fixation.|$|E

40|$|Cross-functional {{sourcing}} {{teams have}} become a popular coordination mechanism to organize company procurement activities. However, many of these teams fail to meet management’s long-term expectations. A lack of sourcing-specific team research obstructs {{a clear understanding of}} the factors that drive sourcing team performance. In the present study, we identified three major dimensions of sourcing team success. Apart from general overall team effectiveness and supply base management effectiveness, sourcing teams need to effectively cooperate with other stakeholders within the firm in order to <b>secure</b> <b>purchasing</b> cost savings and supplier contracts. Additionally, we identified factors that underlie sourcing team success, based upon extensive survey data taken from members, leaders, and managers of 59 (cross functional) sourcing teams in twelve large, multinational companies. Our study revealed that different success factors drive different sourcing team effectiveness dimensions. Also, we found a seemingly contradictory need for both autonomy and formalization to ensure sourcing team effectiveness on all three dimensions. The latter seemed particularly important for teams with high levels of functional diversity...|$|R
