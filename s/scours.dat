The total <b>scour</b> depth of the pier is usually the sum of the depths of the local <b>scouring,</b> contraction <b>scouring</b> and general <b>scouring</b> (i.e., <b>scouring</b> without structures).

40|$|<b>Scour</b> is an {{important}} issue due to the potential great extent of loss and risks associated with <b>scouring.</b> The work described herein constitutes laboratory testing of the time development of <b>scour</b> holes in clayey soils produced by a submerged vertical circular impinging jet. Long term laboratory tests were performed on three types of manufactured pottery clays, Buffstone clay (50. 3 - 51. 7 % clay), P 300 clay (48. 7 - 50. 7 % clay), and M 370 clay (51. 1 - 51. 3 % clay). Detailed measurements of the entire <b>scour</b> hole were performed on a 2 mm grid using a computer controlled laser optical profiler after <b>scouring</b> times of 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 30 min, 40 min, 50 min, 1 h, 1. 5 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 16 h, 24 and then at every 24 h interval until the <b>scour</b> hole was considered to have reached equilibrium based on the criterion used by Mazurek et al. (2001). This resulted in long test durations ranging from 120 h to 384 h. For the time development of the <b>scour</b> hole, a three-dimensional <b>scour</b> hole surface was produced using the data taken by an optical profiler. Thereafter, four cross sections of the <b>scour</b> hole were extracted from the three-dimensional <b>scour</b> hole surface. Dimensions considered for analysis were taken from both the three-dimensional <b>scour</b> hole surface and the cross sections of the <b>scour</b> hole. The volume of the <b>scour</b> hole, and the centreline and maximum <b>scour</b> hole depths were extracted from the <b>scour</b> hole surface. The section-wise maximum <b>scour</b> depth, radius of the <b>scour</b> hole, half-width about the jet centreline, and half-width about the section-wise maximum <b>scour</b> depth were extracted for each cross-sections. The growth of these dimensions were observed with time. For a significant portion of <b>scouring,</b> the centreline and maximum <b>scour</b> hole depths increased linearly with the logarithm of time. For the majority of the tests, the half-widths decreased with time. Temporary ceasing of the increment of the centreline and maximum <b>scour</b> hole depths was observed, called “plateaus”, in the time development plot. <b>Scour</b> hole dimensions for the cross-sections showed variability from the average <b>scour</b> hole dimensions. However, for most of the tests this variability decreased with time as the <b>scour</b> test proceeded. To decide on whether the equilibrium state of the <b>scour</b> hole was achieved, all of the aforementioned <b>scour</b> hole dimensions were evaluated. The characteristic <b>scour</b> hole dimension to decide on the equilibrium condition was termed as the “critical equilibrium dimension”. Four of the <b>scour</b> tests reached an overall equilibrium state, the section wise maximum <b>scour</b> hole depth was the critical equilibrium dimension for three of those. The half-widths were the critical equilibrium dimension for one of the tests. However, previous studies did not consider the “side slope erosion” of the <b>scour</b> hole, hence neglected the section-wise maximum <b>scour</b> depth and half widths for identifying equilibrium condition. Dimensionless <b>scour</b> hole profiles were developed using the centreline <b>scour</b> depth as the scale for <b>scour</b> hole depth and the half-width about the centreline depth as the scale for radial distance from the jet centreline. A general equation of the dimensionless equilibrium <b>scour</b> hole profile was developed by fitting a sine function to the equilibrium <b>scour</b> test profiles using linear regression analysis. Dimensionless <b>scour</b> hole profiles with time during the <b>scour</b> test were compared to the dimensionless profile at equilibrium. It was observed that while for some <b>scour</b> tests the equilibrium <b>scour</b> hole shape formed quickly compared to the time to equilibrium, for some <b>scour</b> tests the equilibrium shapes did not form until the <b>scour</b> hole stopped growing...|$|R
40|$|Bridge <b>scour</b> is {{the leading}} cause of bridge failure all around the world, {{affecting}} significantly on the total construction and maintenance costs. Therefore, <b>scouring</b> around piers and abutments has been extensively studied in the past, focusing on point measurements of <b>scour</b> depth in front of a circular pier in alluvial sand beds. A literature review showed, that there is still a lack of studies on the effects of main <b>scour</b> parameters on the <b>scour</b> hole geometry, and on the mechanism of local <b>scour</b> around piers of different shape and alignment in gravel beds. This thesis attempts to fulfill this gap by experimentally investigating the development of <b>scour</b> holes around piers of different shape and alignment in gravel and sand beds. New non-intrusive, high resolution topography measurements of complete developing and equilibrium <b>scour</b> holes were performed during the experiments with an experimental installation using a laser distance sensor (LDS) and positioning systems.

40|$|Abstract: The {{equilibrium}} <b>scour</b> geometry {{around a}} circular pier protruding vertically on a <b>scoured</b> channel bed was experimentally investigated. In order {{to conduct a}} comparative study, measurements within an equilibrium <b>scour</b> hole at a square pier, an equilateral triangular pier, and a at plate with sides, facing the approaching ow, equaling {{the width of the}} circular pier were taken. Flow in an equilibrium <b>scour</b> hole under a clear water regime was considered for 4 separate tests. Tests were carried out for approaching ow having undisturbed constant ow depth greater than the pier width with a depth-averaged approaching ow velocity of about 68. 2 % representing the critical velocity of the uniform sand bed. It was observed that all the equilibrium dimensionless <b>scour</b> parameters, namely <b>scour</b> depth, length, width, area, and volume, depend on the eective pier width equal to the diameter of the smallest circumscribing circle of the pier. When the eective pier diameter increases and approaching ow depth is constant, <b>scour</b> parameters increase. Based on the results, some empirical equations are proposed for the <b>scour</b> depth, <b>scour</b> length, <b>scour</b> width, <b>scour</b> area, and <b>scour</b> volume. These equations may be utilized to estimate <b>scour</b> geometry in future studies...|$|R

The results which are summarized in this presentation include: · The pier <b>scour</b> equations (HEC- 18 and FDOT) are design equations which do not under predict observed <b>scour</b> very often. Consequently, the probabilistic reliability indexes for pier <b>scour</b> compare favorably with those used by structural and geotechnical engineers in LRFD applications for bridges. · In contrast with the pier <b>scour</b> equations, the HEC- 18 contraction <b>scour</b> equations are essentially predictive, given that they are derived from sediment transport principles and theory. Therefore, under predictions of observed <b>scour</b> are much more common, and the resulting reliability is very low compared to typical target values used in LRFD applications. · The NCHRP 24 - 20 equations for live-bed and clear-water abutment <b>scour</b> both use a calculation for contraction <b>scour</b> and then apply an amplification factor to account for the additional <b>scour</b> caused by local effects at the tip of the abutment.
