Jan {{originally}} came from Ypres, his profession was textile worker, just like his sons Daniel, Benjamin, and Pieter and many of the other Flemish immigrants in Leiden. The members of the Ringh family were specialized workers in <b>serge,</b> camlet or <b>cloth.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Buddhist pilgrim Faxian {{who stayed}} in Shanshan in 399 {{on the way}} to India, {{described}} the country: A country rugged and hilly, with a thin and barren soil. The clothes of the common people are coarse, and like those worn in our land of Han, some wearing felt and others coarse <b>serge</b> or <b>cloth</b> of hair; — this was the only difference seen among them. The king professed (our) Law, and there might be in the country more than four thousand monks who were all students of the hînayâna. The common people of this and other kingdoms (in that region), as well as the śramans, all practise the rules of India, only that the latter do so more exactly, and the former more loosely.

50|$|Paper, {{canvas and}} similar {{materials}} are particularly liable to smoulder after the gun has been fired, hence {{the necessity of}} well sponging the piece. Even with this precaution accidents often occurred owing to a cartridge being ignited by the still glowing debris of the previous round. In order to prevent this, bags of non-smouldering material, such as flannel, <b>serge</b> or silk <b>cloth</b> are used; combustible material such as woven gun-cotton cloth has also been tried, {{but there are certain}} disadvantages attending this.|$|R
50|$|Before 1659, Hondschoote {{was part}} of the Spanish Netherlands. A {{thriving}} wealthy cloth-town, it had thousands of small workshops making <b>serge</b> <b>cloth</b> from locally-grown flax. Events such as Beeldenstorm, conquest by France and the War of the Spanish Succession, however, brought an end to prosperity. The cloth-makers fled to what is now Belgium and England, taking their skills to benefit France's rivals.|$|E
50|$|In the First World War, a khaki Balmoral bonnet was {{introduced}} in 1915 for wear in the trenches by Scottish infantry serving on the Western Front. This {{came to be known}} as the 'bonnet, tam o' shanter', later abbreviated among military personnel to 'ToS'. It replaced the Glengarry - which was the regulation bonnet worn by Scottish troops with khaki field dress at the start of the war. Originally knitted, the military tam o' shanter subsequently came to be constructed from separate pieces of khaki <b>serge</b> <b>cloth.</b>|$|E

Whilst using the ports of London and Bristol as well, Topsham was a major port for the Were export trade. We have a contemporary description of the Exeter trade in serge by Celia Fiennes (1662-1741): [...] There is an Increadible quantety of serges made and sold in the town. There market day is Fryday ... the Large Market house set on stone pillars, wch runs a great Length on wch they Lay their packs of serges. Just by it is another walke wth in pillars wch is for the yarne, the whole town and Country is Employ'd for at Least 20 mile round in spinning, weaveing, dressing and scouring, fulling and Drying of the serges. It turns the most money in a weeke of any thing in England. One weeke with another there is 10000 pound paid in ready money, Sometymes 15000 pound. The weavers brings in their serges and must have their money wch they Employ to provide them yarne to goe to work againe. However, the French Revolution and the invasion of Flanders in 1793 caused very serious difficulties for Exeter cloth merchants, and in 1794 the Weres were forced to cancel major worsted yarn orders.Napoleon's Italian campaigns of 1796-7 closed the Italian market for English cloth, and then Spain entered the war as an ally of France, leading to the confiscation of Exeter cloth. Only six vessels cleared from the Exe with cloth in 1797, and two in 1798; {{a far cry from the}} 1768 despatch of 330,414 pieces of cloth. Some Exeter merchants, such as Barings, moved to London - the Weres changed production to long ells, a fine white serge, for the East India Company. A letter from Thomas Fox to Green and Walford, factors, is to be found in the Fox Brothers Letter Book archive: [...] Wellington, 15th seventh month 1788We have for a great number of years been engaged in a very considerable manufactory of various export articles, the principal of which is mixt serges for Holland, but finding of late a slackness in demand owing to the troubles in that country, and the introduction of cottons and other articles, we see it necessary to turn part of our attention to some other articles of constant demand and Long Ells appear to us the most eligible. We hope if a tryal appears to answer we may in time prove mutually useful correspondents. With the termination of the monopoly of the East India Company's charter in 1833 through the Government of India Act 1833 (3 & 4 Will. 4 c. 85), the trade in long ells to China declined, and Thomas Fox developed the production of flannel, which was sold in the home market and to America. Following his Quaker beliefs, Thomas Fox refused to sell flannel to the East India Company when he heard it would be used in the manufacture of cartridges.In 1881, as a result of losses in the First Boer War, a Parliamentary Commission sought to equip the army with khaki uniform. Fox Brothers decided to bid for the contract, reasoning that the new contract for 5,000 puttees would save lives, as well as create employment. Fox Brothers went on to be the major producer of puttees, manufacturing some 850 miles of the cloth in World War One.|$|E
50|$|Until the 19th century, Arfeuilles was {{a prosperous}} commune with {{agriculture}} {{as the main}} activity. Workshops carding wool, spinning, making <b>Serge,</b> and <b>cloth</b> were installed {{in the vicinity of}} the town. Along the river Barbenan over 14 grain mills, oil presses, and sawmills were recorded in the land registry of 1829. With rugged terrain and fragmented and dispersed rural farms, agriculture was poorly suited to agricultural mechanization and land gave way gradually to reforestation. The nearest railway station was more than seven kilometres from the village near the National Highway N7 so Arfeuilles did not benefit from the opening up of road and rail in the 19th century. The consequences were a gradual decline in activity and demographic change. Currently, a second breath of air has been brought to the region through the development of green tourism.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 17th century, Buttony {{had grown}} to become an {{important}} industry, controlled within the Case family. A great many pedlars and hawkers were registered in Shaftesbury, far more than in any other local towns. An Act of Parliament was passed in 1699 that, amongst its export restrictions on woolens, prevented the making of buttons “made of <b>cloth,</b> <b>serge,</b> drugget, or other stuffs”. The Act would remain in force for two hundred years, but in practice appears to have had little lasting effect on trade.|$|R
5000|$|In 1891 Sick Berth {{personnel}} {{received a}} new style of uniform. Instead of the blue <b>serge</b> jumper, blue <b>cloth</b> collar and bell bottom trousers, known as ‘Square Rig, they received a single or double breasted jacket and trousers with black buttons, red badges and a peaked cap. This was known as ‘fore and aft’ rig, and issued to ‘all ratings not dressed as seamen. This uniform was also issued to tradesmen known as [...] "Artificers", who were collectively known as [...] "Tiffies". So it was natural that sick berth attendants were also known as [...] "Sick Berth Tiffies".|$|R
60|$|I have endeavoured to {{make some}} {{calculation}} {{of the number of}} shopkeepers in this kingdom, but I find it is not to be done--we may as well count the stars; not that they are equal in number neither, but it is as impossible, unless any one person corresponded so as to have them numbered in every town or parish throughout the kingdom. I doubt not they are some hundreds of thousands, but there is no making an estimate--the number is in a manner infinite. It is as impossible likewise to make any guess at the bulk of their trade, and how much they return yearly; nor, if we could, would it give any foundation for any just calculation of the value of goods in general, because all our goods circulate so much, and go so often through so many hands before they come to the consumer. This so often passing every sort of goods through so many hands, before it comes {{into the hands of the}} last consumer, is that which makes our trade be so immensely great. For example, if there is made in England for our home-consumption the value of £100,000 worth of any particular goods, say, for example, that it be so many pieces of <b>serge</b> or <b>cloth,</b> and if this goes through ten tradesmen's hands, before it comes to the last consumer, then there is £1,000,000 returned in trade for that £100,000 worth of goods; and so of all the sorts of goods we trade in.|$|R
50|$|Robert Palk {{was born}} in December 1717 at Lower Headborough Farm in the parish of Ashburton, Devon, and was baptised on 16 December 1717 at the Old Mission House, Ashburton. His father was Walter Palk, born in 1686, of yeoman farmer stock {{and his mother was}} Frances Abraham, the {{daughter}} of Robert Abraham. Walter Palk supplemented his income by acting as a carrier of <b>serge</b> from the <b>cloth</b> mills at Ashburton over Haldon Hill to market at Exeter. Robert had a sister Grace Palk and a brother Walter Palk, whose son, and Robert's nephew, was Walter Palk (1742-1819) of Marley House in the parish of Rattery, Devon, a Member of Parliament for his family's Pocket Borough of Ashburton in Devon from 1796 to 1811, Sheriff of Devon (1791-2) and in 1798 a Captain in the Ashburton Volunteer Militia. It was Robert who was to bring the family fame and fortune. According to Robert's own statements, the Palk family was resident at Ambrooke in the late 15th century, which at the time of Robert's birth in 1717 was owned by the Neyle family. This would therefore appear to discount suppositions in some sources that Robert himself was born at Ambrooke.|$|R

Untwining his gold chain from his neck, Balafre twisted off, with his firm and strong set teeth, about four inches from the one end of it, and said to his attendant, [...] "Here, Andrew, carry this to my gossip, jolly Father Boniface, the monk of St. Martin's; greet him well from me, {{by the same token}} that he could not say God save ye when we last parted at midnight.--Tell my gossip that my brother and sister, and some others of my house, are all dead and gone, and I pray him to say masses for their souls as far as the value of these links will carry him, and to do on trust what else may be necessary to free them from Purgatory. And hark ye, as they were just living people, and free from all heresy, it may be that they are well nigh out of limbo already, so that a little matter may have them free of the fetlocks; and in that case, look ye, ye will say I desire to take out the balance of the gold in curses upon a generation called the Ogilvies of Angus Shire, in what way soever the church may best come at them. You understand all this, Andrew?" ...|$|R
