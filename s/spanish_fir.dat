5|$|Morchella frustrata fruit bodies grow solitary, scattered, or {{in small}} groups in spring, in mountainous forests and maquis. The exact trophic status of the fungus is not yet known with certainty, but it is {{suspected}} to be fucaltitive mycorrhizal or biotrophic. Tree species associated with the fungus include pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), oaks (Quercus spp.), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), and white fir (Abies concolor). In Europe it is often found with holm oak (Quercus ilex), strawberry trees (Arbutus andrachne), olive trees (Olea europaea), <b>Spanish</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies pinsapo), Silver fir (Abies alba) and Scot's pine (Pinus sylvestris). Although it was originally hypothesized that collections of M. frustrata from Turkey might have been recently introduced from North America, numerous collections reported since from remote and undisturbed areas in the Mediterranean and the Alps (including Bresadola's original collection from Trentino), suggest a long-time and well-established presence of this species in Europe.

50|$|Abies pinsapo (<b>Spanish</b> <b>fir)</b> is {{a species}} of fir native to {{southern}} Spain and northern Morocco. Related to other species of Mediterranean firs, it is considered the Andalusian National Tree. In Spain, it appears at altitudes of 900 - 1800 m in the Sierra de Grazalema {{in the province of}} Cádiz and the Sierra de las Nieves and Sierra Bermeja, both near Ronda in the province of Málaga. In Morocco, it is limited to the Rif Mountains at altitudes of 1400 - 2100 m on Jebel Tissouka and Jebel Tazaot.|$|E

In addition to La Torrecilla peak (1,919 m.), there are ancient woodlands of <b>Spanish</b> <b>Fir</b> and gall oak.

The channel of the Rio Grande flows through the town from northeast to south.|$|E
50|$|In broad terms, {{the typical}} {{vegetation}} of Andalusia is Mediterranean woodland, characterized by leafy xerophilic perennials, {{adapted to the}} long, dry summers. The dominant species of the climax community is the holly oak (Quercus ilex). Also abundant are cork oak (Quercus suber), various pines, and <b>Spanish</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies pinsapo). Due to cultivation, olive (Olea europaea) and almond (Prunus dulcis) trees also abound. The dominant understory is composed of thorny and aromatic woody species, such as rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), thyme (Thymus), and Cistus. In the wettest areas with acidic soils, the most abundant species are the oak and cork oak, and the cultivated Eucalyptus. In the woodlands, leafy hardwoods of genus Populus (poplars, aspens, cottonwoods) and Ulmus (elms) are also abundant; poplars are cultivated in the plains of Granada.|$|E

40|$|The genus Abies {{comprises}} 48 {{species of}} fir trees, {{making it the}} second largest genus in the Pinaceae after Pinus. Phylogenetic analyses using one nuclear and three chloroplast regions confirm the monophyly of the Pinaceae. Results also show that the Pinoideae is sister to Abietoideae and Keteleeria is sister to Abies. Results suggest {{that the number of}} sections in Abies probably need to be reduced to eight rather than ten. The Mexican species are placed in two sections currently but are shown to be monophyletic. The Mediterranean group of species is also shown to be monophyletic but there is little resolution within this clade, again reducing the sectional level of classification appears appropriate in this case. Several origins are speculated for this group including a North American origin via long distance dispersal; however, perhaps the most likely pattern is one of a pan-northern hemispherical distribution subsequently fragmented into refugia from which modem clades have diversified relatively recently. Conservation assessements have been compiled for the Mediterranean taxa, especially those of the south west Mediterranean. These assessments suggest that the level of threat is greater than previously thought for Abies pinspo var. pinsapo, Abies pinsapo var. marocana and A. numidica.

40|$|International audienceThe <b>Spanish</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies pinsapo Boiss.) is a conifer {{endemic to}} {{southern}} Spain and {{belongs to a}} Mediterranean basin group of firs considered to be relict. Megagametophyte storage proteins are {{a useful tool for}} the evaluation of genetic variability due to the haploid nature of megagametophytes in conifers. * In this paper, we report for the first time, the usefulness of megagametophyte storage proteins marker in A. pinsapo as a first investigation of the level of genetic diversity conserved in the extant stands of this relict conifer. For this, four populations were analysed from the three areas in which the species is still found. A total of thirty trees and ten megagametophytes per tree were analysed. In addition, 191 megagametophytes from two trees were assessed to identify polymorphic bands and to confirm Mendelian inheritance 1 : 1. * Albumins have proved to be a good marker to assess the genetic variability in this species, due to their high level of variation. Fourteen polymorphic bands adjusted to the expected 1 : 1 segregation ratio, two cases of allelism and eight of linkage were detected. * The genetic diversity study showed that, in the four populations, approximately half of the genetic diversity was among trees and the other half among seeds of each tree. Differentiation between populations was less than 6. 0 %. Results from this study could be useful for determining appropriate conservation management strategies for this endangered species...|$|E
