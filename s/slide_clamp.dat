DNA polymerases maintain proximity to nucleic acid templates by interacting with <b>sliding</b> <b>clamps</b> that encircle DNA and thereby link the polymerase enzyme to the DNA substrate. Although the structures of <b>sliding</b> <b>clamps</b> from Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli), eukaryotes, archaea, and T 4 -like bacteriophages are well-known, {{the structure of a}} <b>sliding</b> <b>clamp</b> from Gram-positive bacteria has not been reported previously. Results We have determined the crystal structure of the dimeric β subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme of Streptococcus pyogenes. The <b>sliding</b> <b>clamp</b> from this Gram-positive organism forms a ring-shaped dimeric assembly that is similar in overall structure to that of the <b>sliding</b> <b>clamps</b> from Gram-negative bacteria, bacteriophage T 4, eukaryotes and archaea. The dimer has overall dimensions of ~ 90 Å × ~ 70 Å × ~ 25 Å with a central chamber that is large enough to accommodate duplex DNA. In comparison to the circular shape of other assemblies, the S. pyogenes clamp adopts a more elliptical structure. Conclusion The sequences of <b>sliding</b> <b>clamps</b> from S. pyogenes and E. coli are only 23 % identical, making the generation of structural models for the S. pyogenes clamp difficult in the absence of direct experimental information. Our structure of the S. pyogenes β subunit completes the catalog of clamp structures from all the major sequence grouping of <b>sliding</b> <b>clamps.</b> The more elliptical rather than circular structure of the S. pyogenes clamp implies that the topological nature of encircling DNA, rather than a precise geometric shape, is the most conserved aspect for this family of proteins. </p...|$|R

Essential {{to the organization}} of the replication machinery are ring-shaped proteins, like PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen) or the �-clamp, collectively named <b>sliding</b> <b>clamps.</b> They encircle the DNA molecule and slide on it freely and bidirectionally. <b>Sliding</b> <b>clamps</b> are typically associated to DNA polymerases and provide these enzymes with the processivity required to synthesize large chromosomes. Additionally, they interact with a large array of proteins that perform enzymatic reactions on DNA, targeting and orchestrating their functions. In recent years there have been a large number of studies that have analyzed the structural details of how <b>sliding</b> <b>clamps</b> interact with their ligands. However, much remains to be learned in relation to how these interactions are regulated to occur coordinately and sequentially. Since <b>sliding</b> <b>clamps</b> participate in reactions in which many different enzymes bind and then release from the clamp in an orchestrated way, it is critical to analyze how these changes in affinity take place.

In the absence of other proteins, the DNA <b>sliding</b> <b>clamps</b> are thought to 'freely slide' along the DNA; however, the abundance of positively charged residues along the inner surface may create favorable electrostatic contact with the highly negatively charged DNA. We have performed single-molecule measurements on a fluorescently labeled {beta}-clamp loaded onto freely diffusing plasmids annealed with fluorescently labeled primers of up to 90 bases.

To address these questions we analyzed DNA replicases of double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of antibiotic-resistant bacteria necessitates {{the discovery of}} new classes of antibiotics acting through novel mechanisms. The bacterial <b>sliding</b> <b>clamp,</b> {{also known as the}} DNA polymerase III β subunit, engages in multiple protein-protein interactions by recognizing conserved penta- or hexapeptide motifs in various binding partners during DNA replication and repair. The central role of the <b>sliding</b> <b>clamp</b> in DNA replication and repair make it an attractive antibiotic target. Protein-protein interactions based on linear motif (LM) recognition play roles in many cell regulatory processes. The E. coli <b>sliding</b> <b>clamp</b> uses a common surface pocket composed of two sub-sites (I and II) to interact with LMs in multiple binding partners. A structural and thermodynamic dissection of sliding clamp-LM recognition has been performed, providing support for a sequential binding model. According to the model, a hydrophobic C-terminal LM dipeptide sub-motif acts as an anchor to establish initial contacts within subsite I and this is followed by formation of a stabilizing hydrogenbonding network between the flanking LM residues and subsite II. Differential solvation/desolvation effects during positioning of the sub-motifs are proposed to act as drivers of sequential binding. This model provides general insights into linear motif recognition and should guide the design of small-molecule inhibitors of the E. coli <b>sliding</b> <b>clamp.</b> Following the study of the LM recognition, fragment-based screening against the E. coli <b>sliding</b> <b>clamp</b> using X-ray crystallography, was carried out. Screening 352 fragment compounds produced hits bound at one of the two LM-binding subsites (subsites I). These fragment compounds were estimated to have millimolar binding affinity to the E. coli <b>sliding</b> <b>clamp.</b> A number of small-molecule inhibitors were designed based on the fragment hits, aided by molecular docking, and were found to bind to subsite I and inhibit LM-binding by the E. coli <b>sliding</b> <b>clamp.</b> They showed increased affinity at the micromolar level.

This dissertation highlights regulatory roles for two critical protein complexes {{at the heart of}} the replication fork: 1) the <b>sliding</b> <b>clamp,</b> the major polymerase processivity factor, and 2) the <b>sliding</b> <b>clamp</b> loader, a spiral-shaped AAA+ ATPase, which loads the clamp onto DNA. The clamp is a promiscuous binding protein that interacts with at least 100 binding partners to orchestrate many processes on DNA, but spatiotemporal regulation of these binding interactions is unknown. Remarkably, a recent disease-causing mutant of the <b>sliding</b> <b>clamp</b> showed specific defects in DNA repair pathways. We aimed to use this mutant as a tool to understand the binding specificity of clamp interactions, and investigate the disease further. We solved three structures of the mutant, and biochemically showed perturbation of partnerbinding for some, but not all, ligands. Using a fission yeast model, we showed that mutant cells are sensitive to select DNA damaging agents. These data revealed significant flexibility within the binding site, which likely regulates partner binding. Before the clamp can act on DNA, the <b>sliding</b> <b>clamp</b> loader places the clamp onto DNA at primer/template (p/t) junctions. The clamp loader reaction couples p/t binding and subsequent ATP hydrolysis to clamp closure.

The third complex is the clamp loader complex, which loads the <b>sliding</b> <b>clamp</b> onto DNA using energy from ATP binding and hydrolysis. This thesis analyses the structures of two important components of the chromosomal replicase assembly through X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations. First, a crystal structure of the DNA polymerase from archaebacterium Desulfurococcus Tok (D. Tok Pol) was solved at 2. 4 A. The structure revealed its similarity to that of the DNA polymerase from bacteriophage RB 69 in spite of a low sequence identity between these two members of the Pol II family of DNA polymerases. Secondly, a series of molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the <b>sliding</b> <b>clamps</b> from Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pyogenes. The studies demonstrated that one subunit of the dimeric clamp, when the other subunit is absent, would relax to a structure of reduced curvature (2 ̆ 2 open 2 ̆ 2 state) when compared to its structure in the dimer (2 ̆ 2 closed 2 ̆ 2 state). Free energy calculations suggest that this spontaneous structural change is driven by higher angle and dihedral energies in the 2 ̆ 2 closed 2 ̆ 2 state. This finding led to the hypothesis that <b>sliding</b> <b>clamps</b> are spring-loaded rings that relax during the loading reaction when one of their oligomeric interfaces is disrupted by the clamp loader complex.

40|$|AbstractWe {{have solved}} the crystal {{structures}} of the bacteriophage RB 69 <b>sliding</b> <b>clamp,</b> its complex with a peptide essential for DNA polymerase interactions, and the DNA polymerase complexed with primer–template DNA. The editing complex structure shows a partially melted duplex DNA exiting from the exonuclease domain at an unexpected angle and {{significant changes in the}} protein structure. The clamp complex shows the C-terminal 11 residues of polymerase bound in a hydrophobic pocket, and it allows docking of the editing and clamp structures together. The peptide binds to the <b>sliding</b> <b>clamp</b> at a position identical to that of a replication inhibitor peptide bound to PCNA, suggesting that the replication inhibitor protein p 21 CIP 1 functions by competing with eukaryotic polymerases for the same binding pocket on the clamp...|$|R
