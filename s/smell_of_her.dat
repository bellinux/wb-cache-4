500|$|Eddie helps Lars, Lita, and Ophelia {{create an}} army, named [...] "Ironheade" [...] {{to fight against}} General Lionwhyte. They {{successfully}} raid Lionwhyte's [...] "Pleasure Tower" [...] and defeat him. However, as they celebrate, Doviculus arrives, sending the group into hiding. Doviculus {{is aware of the}} presence of his spy [...] "Succoria" [...] by the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> blood as it was at the Temple; Eddie and his allies come to believe Ophelia is Doviculus' spy. Lars leaves his hiding spot to face Doviculus, but is quickly killed. As the Tainted Coil destroy the tower, Ironheade escapes into the nearby mountains; Eddie is forced to leave with Lita leaving Ophelia behind despite their shared love. Heartbroken, Ophelia is drawn toward the Sea of Black Tears, cursed waters that grant humans supernatural abilities at the cost of humanity. After leaping into the black waters, the Sea creates a dark doppelganger of Ophelia, who raises an army of other Black Tear-corrupted humans, the goth [...] "Drowning Doom". After three months, she leads an attack on Ironheade's mountain camp. Though Ironheade defeats the assault, Eddie determines they must destroy the Sea to end her threat. As they travel through exotic lands and finding more allies out of the pyromanical Fire Barons and the amazonian Zaulia tribe, they come across evidence of Eddie's father, the hero known as Riggnarok in this time. It tells that Riggnarok traveled to the future to attempt to learn the secrets of the Titans to bring back to the past in the humans' ongoing fight against the demons, but never returned.|$|E
60|$|This Lebanon, therefore, {{was a place}} {{considerable}} and {{a figure}} of great things; the countenance of the Lord Jesus is compared to it, {{and so is the}} face of his spouse, and also the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> garment (Cant 4:11, 5:15, 7:4).|$|E
60|$|Maud {{advanced}} quickly. His {{eyes had}} {{grown accustomed to}} the murk, {{and he could see}} her dimly. The <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> damp raincoat came to him like a breath of ozone. He could even see her eyes shining in the darkness, so close was she to him.|$|E
50|$|Memories of India {{reflects}} Matthew's mixed background, as she {{was born}} in England, raised in India and now is living in America.The images are a time warp, revisiting the sights, sounds, and <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> childhood impressions <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cultural homeland, India. The images are captured by the use of a simple plastic-lensed Holga camera, that makes images with a dreamy quality.|$|R
5000|$|Grumblethorpe is {{believed}} to be haunted by James Agnew and an orphan of the Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793 named Justinia. Her sightings are usually accompanied by the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> baking bread, <b>her</b> passion in life.|$|R
5000|$|The {{experiments}} supported Vugo's {{hypothesis that}} [...] "smell precedes the direct mouthing information on odor or <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> food." [...] <b>Her</b> work demonstrated the natural tendency of primates to use scent to assess an object they assume fragrant.|$|R
60|$|Happy. Happier then. Snug {{little room}} that {{was with the}} red wallpaper. Dockrell's, one and ninepence a dozen. Milly's tubbing night. American soap I bought: elderflower. Cosy <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bathwater. Funny she looked soaped all over. Shapely too. Now photography. Poor papa's {{daguerreotype}} atelier he told me of. Hereditary taste.|$|E
60|$|Yea, {{many of the}} {{features}} of the then church of God were set forth, as in figures and shadows, so by places and things, in that land. 1. In general, she is said to be beautiful as Tirzah, and to be comely as Jerusalem (Can 6:4). 2. In particular, her neck is compared to the tower of David, builded for an armoury (Cant 4:4). Her eyes to the fish-pools of Heshbon, by the gate of Bethrabbim. Her nose is compared to the tower of Lebanon, which looketh towards Damascus (Cant 7:4). Yea, the hair of her head is compared to a flock of goats, which come up from mount Gilead; and the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> garments to the smell of Lebanon (Cant 4:1,11).|$|E
6000|$|At Brinton {{she spent}} hours in her mother's garden, {{where she had}} grown up, where she {{considered}} that she was training for old age, since she meant not to depend on whist. She loved the place as, had she been a good Catholic, she would have loved the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> parish church; and indeed there was in her passion for flowers something of the respect of a religion. They seemed to her the only {{things in the world}} that really respected themselves, unless one made an exception for Nutkins, who had been in command all through her mother's time, with whom she had had a real friendship and who had been affected by their pure example. He was the person left in the world with whom on the whole she could speak most intimately of the dead. They never had to name her together--they only said [...] "she"; and Nutkins freely conceded that she had taught him everything he knew. When Beatrice and Muriel said [...] "she" [...] they referred to Mrs. Churchley. Adela had reason to believe she should never marry, and that some day she should have about a thousand a year. This made her see in the far future a little garden of her own, under a hill, full of rare and exquisite things, where she would spend most of her old age on her knees with an apron and stout gloves, with a pair of shears and a trowel, steeped in the comfort of being thought mad.|$|E
5000|$|In the webcomic Homestuck, alien troll Terezi Pyrope is blinded, but {{learns to}} see by [...] "coloring" [...] the <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> things around <b>her.</b> Likewise, her ancestor, Latula Pyrope, loses <b>her</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>smell,</b> and learns to [...] "smell" [...] using her eyes, smelling the colors.|$|R
60|$|Gyp sat quite {{still for}} a few seconds, {{and then began to}} laugh. He looked so like a sulky child, {{standing}} there. He turned swiftly on her and put his hand over her mouth. She looked up over that hand which <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> tobacco. <b>Her</b> heart was doing the grand ecart within her, this way in compunction, that way in resentment. His eyes fell before hers; he dropped his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take them--I {{will not}} haf your English money--take them." [...] And {{suddenly}} she tore them across twice, three times, let the bits flutter to the floor, {{and turned her}} back to him. He stood looking at her leaning against the plush-covered table which <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> dust; <b>her</b> head down, a dark figure {{in a dark room}} with the moonlight sharpening her outline--hardly a moment he stayed, then made for the door....|$|R
6000|$|The second parting from Miss Overmore {{had been}} bad enough, but this first parting from Mrs. Wix was much worse. The child had lately {{been to the}} dentist's and had a term of {{comparison}} for the screwed-up intensity of the scene. It was dreadfully silent, {{as it had been}} when her tooth was taken out; Mrs. Wix had on that occasion grabbed her hand and they had clung to each other with the frenzy of their determination not to scream. Maisie, at the dentist's, had been heroically still, but just when she felt most anguish had become aware of an audible shriek on the part of her companion, a spasm of stifled sympathy. This was reproduced by the only sound that broke their supreme embrace when, a month later, the [...] "arrangement," [...] as her periodical uprootings were called, played the part of the horrible forceps. Embedded in Mrs. Wix's nature as her tooth had been socketed in her gum, the operation of extracting her would really have been a case for chloroform. It was a hug that fortunately left nothing to say, for the poor woman's want of words at such an hour seemed to fall in with her want of everything. Maisie's alternate parent, in the outermost vestibule--he liked the impertinence of crossing as much as that of his late wife's threshold--stood over them with his open watch and his still more open grin, while from the only corner of an eye on which something of Mrs. Wix's didn't impinge the child saw at the door a brougham in which Miss Overmore also waited. She remembered the difference when, six months before, she had been torn from the breast of that more spirited protectress. Miss Overmore, then also in the vestibule, but of course in the other one, had been thoroughly audible and voluble; her protest had rung out bravely and she had declared that something--her pupil didn't know exactly what--was a regular wicked shame. That had at the time dimly recalled to Maisie the far-away moment of Moddle's great outbreak: there seemed always to be [...] "shames" [...] connected {{in one way or another}} with her migrations. At present, while Mrs. Wix's arms tightened and the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hair was strong, she further remembered how, in pacifying Miss Overmore, papa had made use of the words [...] "you dear old duck!"--an expression which, by its oddity, had stuck fast in her young mind, having moreover a place well prepared for it there by what she knew of the governess whom she now always mentally characterised as the pretty one. She wondered whether this affection would be as great as before: that would at all events be the case with the prettiness Maisie could see in the face which showed brightly at the window of the brougham.|$|E
5000|$|Infamous, that fifteen {{thousand}} Russian officers {{should have let}} themselves be slaughtered by the Revolution without raising a hand in self-defense! Why didnt they act like the Germans, who killed Rosa Luxemburg {{in such a way}} that not even a <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> has remained? ...|$|E
50|$|After assaulting a {{passenger}} over the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> perfume in 1998, Takuma was fired {{and got a}} new job as maintenance man at Itami Elementary School, 6 kilometers away from Ikeda.

60|$|She rushed away, and appeared, a pale terrified figure, {{with the}} <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> fire on <b>her</b> hair and white dress, {{in the room}} where Mrs. Aylward was reading her evening chapter. She could {{scarcely}} utter her message as she stood under the gaze of blank amazement; but Mrs. Aylward understood enough to make her start up without another word, and hurry away, candle in hand.|$|R
50|$|Niles' {{feelings}} for Daphne {{are the basis}} for many gags on the show, including the numerous ways he demonstrates how besotted he is with her (such as being entranced by the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hair or staring at her rear end when she bends over), but develops {{over the course of}} the series into an important plot line.|$|E
50|$|In authumn of 1941, Mirra gets pregnant. Pluzhnikov persuades Mirra {{to leave}} the {{basement}} for child sake.

5000|$|... "Pig Foot Mary" [...] is a {{character}} in Harlem.

[...] "Mary," [...] whose real name is Mrs. Mary Dean, bought the five-story apartment house at the corner of Seventh Avenue and One Hundred and Thirty-seventh Street at a price of $42,000. Later she sold it to the Y.W.C.A. for dormitory purposes.|$|E

60|$|Ailie {{went about}} the decks, looking on with mingled wonder, interest, and disgust. She stepped about gingerly, as if afraid of coming {{in contact with}} slimy objects, and with her nose and mouth screwed up after the fashion {{of those who are}} obliged to endure bad <b>smells.</b> The {{expression}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face under the circumstances was amusing.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> {{laburnum}} distracts <b>her.</b> Suddenly old Mr Tyler is {{upon her}} ringing his cycle bell.

Maddy again bemoans the loss of Minnie but refuses to be comforted by Tyler who rides off despite realising that his rear tyre is flat.|$|R
50|$|Imprinting is {{most often}} used to {{describe}} an early-life bond that can later affect an animal’s mate choice. More broadly, the term refers to a rapid and selective learning process that only can occur during certain times in an animal’s life. In sheep, ewes having just given birth imprint onto their lambs {{on the basis of}} olfactory cues, allowing mothers to distinguish their own offspring from other lambs in the flock. This olfactory-based imprinting is dependent on a ewe’s behavior after giving birth, on the presence of amniotic fluid, and on a specialized odor-influenced learning process which allows the ewe to quickly memorize the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> offspring, to whom she then forms an exclusive maternal bond.|$|E
50|$|Suspicious of Shady Palms, Charity seeks {{aid from}} Sergeant Gallagher, {{but he is}} of no help, simply telling Charity that he may {{question}} Edith if Faith does not reappear {{in a day or}} two. Taking matters into her own hands, Charity sneaks into Shady Palms, and is stabbed to death by Edith after finding the bodies in the garage. Immediately after Edith kills Charity, she receives a call from Sergeant Gallagher, who makes an appointment to speak to her about Faith. Edith tries to cover-up the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> and Gordon's victims with lime, but this backfires when the rats that were feeding on the bodies are driven out into the street by the substance, dragging pieces of human flesh with them. This prompts Sergeant Gallagher to get a warrant to scour Shady Palms. When Gallagher appears with the warrant, Edith slumps on a couch, and wordlessly sulks as Gordon calls to her from his room.|$|E

The both ladies will fight each other, and the winner will then destroy planet Earth as we know it (in some kind of Armageddon). In the final countdown, the little remaining group must {{try to find out what}} supernatural capability the baby, or the The Balancer of Power, actually has before the Dark Lady arrives. But as the [...] "mind reader" [...] attempts to read the mind of the baby,he only discover that she doesn't like water - but there is a certain smell that she longs for. Then the baby gets to strong [...] "to be read". And at the second attempt the [...] "mindreader" [...] simply dies, but before he dies, he explains that the smell the baby longs for, is the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dead mother.|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} low inside the house, and so dim, with the closed blinds, {{that they could}} {{scarcely}} see one another: Editha tall and black in her crapes which filled {{the air with the}} <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> their dyes; <b>her</b> father standing decorously apart with his hat on his forearm, as at funerals; a woman rested in a deep arm-chair, and the woman who had let the strangers in stood behind the chair.|$|R

50|$|A {{merchant}} loses all {{his money}} when his ships are lost at sea, and is forced to move his three daughters to a lonely countryside house called Rose Cottage which was left to his youngest, Beauty, in a will, and thus {{is not subject to}} his creditors. The garden of the house is full of strange thorny bushes and vines, which neither of the merchant nor his three daughters can identify. Beauty asks in the town and discovers that they are the roses the cottage are called after and begins to tend them, because she loves gardening and she remembers the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mother's rose perfume. Roses are very rare because only great magic or great love can grow them. The roses bloom under Beauty's care, and the sisters sells wreaths of them in the town. After some time, the merchant hears word that one of his ships might have made it back and journeys to find out if it's true. He asks his daughters what presents they would like him to bring back, and Beauty requests a rose, as her bush has not blossomed that year because it has been so cold and rainy and miserable.|$|E

60|$|The {{decrepit}} station fly, mouldy and <b>smelling</b> <b>of</b> stables, bore <b>her</b> almost lovingly {{towards the}} Hall. Its old driver, clean-faced, cheery, somewhat like a bird, drove her almost furiously, for, {{though he knew}} nothing, he felt that two whole days and half a day were quite long {{enough for her to}} be away. At the lodge gate old Roy, the Skye, was seated on his haunches, and the sight of him set Mrs. Pendyce trembling as though till then she had not realised that she was coming home.|$|R
