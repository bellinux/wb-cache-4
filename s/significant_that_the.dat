5|$|Despite {{the widely}} held {{view that the}} authors of the Synoptic Gospels drew upon each other (the {{so-called}} synoptic problem), other scholars take it as <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> virgin birth is attested by two separate gospels, Matthew and Luke.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only {{musician}} {{with whom}} he remained a close personal friend, Ignaz Moscheles, was of an older generation and equally conservative in outlook. Moscheles preserved this outlook at the Leipzig Conservatory until his own death in 1870.|$|E
5|$|The {{book had}} a sacramental rather than {{educational}} purpose. Such a large, lavish Gospel {{would have been}} left on the high altar {{of the church and}} removed only for the reading of the Gospel during Mass, with the reader probably reciting from memory more than reading the text. It is <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Chronicles of Ulster state the book was stolen from the sacristy, where the vessels and other accoutrements of the Mass were stored, rather than from the monastic library. Its design seems to take this purpose in mind; that is, the book was produced with appearance taking precedence over practicality. There are numerous uncorrected mistakes in the text. Lines were often completed in a blank space in the line above. The chapter headings that were necessary to make the canon tables usable were not inserted into the margins of the page. In general, nothing was done to disrupt the look of the page: aesthetics were given priority over utility.|$|E

25|$|Results of {{a medical}} study known as the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) {{demonstrated}} that patients with structural heart disease (such as a history of MI (heart attack), or left ventricular dysfunction) and also patients with ventricular arrhythmias, should not take this drug. The results were so <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> trial was stopped early and preliminary results were published.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{scholarly}} {{consensus is}} that {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth rests on a very slim historical foundation. However, some writers take it as <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> virgin birth is attested by two separate gospels, although the details of each vary. In this view, the virgin conception and birth constitute a tradition that fits within the criterion of multiple attestation, because the accounts of Matthew and Luke are taken as two independent testimonies of the tradition.|$|E
25|$|Both the {{criticism}} {{and the public}} response to it indicate a deepening level of dissent, not only within the kingdom's religious establishment, but also among the public. It is <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> question was asked and answered in a public forum, and then reprinted in the media -- including the Arabic and English language newspapers. Similar questions of legitimacy will arise in coming months, with the kingdom's religious, political and perhaps military leaderships becoming the focal points for increasingly intense criticism.|$|E

5000|$|The {{east coast}} of the sea was {{definitely}} attached to Galilee in AD 84, and Ptolemy (c. 140) places Julias in Galilee. It is therefore <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> only <b>the</b> Fourth Gospel speaks of [...] "Bethsaida of Galilee".|$|R
25|$|It is <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> main {{target of}} Tet was the GVN, the party tasked with pacification, the weak {{link in the}} defense of South Vietnam. Contrary to NLF dogma and expectations, the hoped for {{uprising}} of the masses never occurred. The South Vietnamese did not embrace the cause, and many ARVN units stood firm and fought back. Nevertheless, Tet demonstrates how Communist strategy was focused on the key element in a People's War- the population – whether to control it or demoralize it, while American strategy focused on kill ratios and attrition.|$|E
25|$|Louis Feldman {{states that}} it is <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{passages}} on James, John and the Testimonium {{are found in the}} Antiquities and not in the Jewish Wars, but provides three explanations for their absence from the Jewish Wars. One explanation is that the Antiquities covers the time period involved at a greater length than the Jewish Wars. The second explanation is that during the gap between the writing of the Jewish Wars (c. 70 AD) and Antiquities (after 90 AD) Christians had become more important in Rome and were hence given attention in the Antiquities. Another explanation is that the passages were added to the Antiquities to highlight the power of the Pharisees, but he considers the last explanation less likely than the others.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the biggest}} reason behind the spread of Islam in the region was the very weak {{presence}} of the Church in Bosnia at the time. The old competition between the Catholic and Bosnian churches (along with the Orthodox Church in certain areas) contributed to a very weak and disorganized religious structure in much of Bosnia. To many Bosnians religion {{was a combination of}} traditions and superstitions. Compared to the well-funded and organized religious institutions of their neighbors, it was relatively easy for Bosnians to switch from their folk-Christianity to Islam. It is <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only other European region under Ottoman control where {{a large segment of the}} population adopted Islam was Albania; also home to competing Christian sects. Some taxes on Muslims and orthodox Vlachs were also lighter than those on other rayah. The Hatt-ı Şerif attempted to eliminate this uneven taxation.|$|E

500|$|Julie Shultz, in {{her journal}} {{article on the}} 1925 celebration, finds it <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> medal {{has nothing to do}} with the arrival of the Restauration in an already-formed United States, but symbolizes ethnic pride in the early explorers. Noting that one of the stamps depicts a Viking ship and the other the Restauration, she concludes of these three {{government}} issues for the celebration: [...] "Though outwardly, these souvenirs were to symbolize the Norwegian immigrant heritage that began in 1825, they actually invert the dominant narrative by using an American form to proclaim that Norwegians were the first Europeans to land on American soil." ...|$|E
500|$|While Sappho's poetry was admired in {{the ancient}} world, her {{character}} was not always so well considered. [...] In the Roman period, critics found her lustful and perhaps even homosexual. [...] Horace called her [...] "mascula Sappho" [...] in his Epistles, which the later Porphyrio commented was [...] "either because she is famous for her poetry, in which men more often excel, or because she is maligned for having been a tribad". [...] By the third century AD, the difference between Sappho's literary reputation as a poet and her moral reputation as a woman had become so <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> suggestion that there were in fact two Sapphos began to develop. [...] In his Historical Miscellanies, Aelian wrote that there was [...] "another Sappho, a courtesan, not a poetess".|$|E
500|$|Alfred, by [...] in {{full control}} of Wessex and {{at the height of}} his power, was clearly bent on trying to settle the kingship on his son, Edward, to the {{exclusion}} of his brother Æthelred's heirs. That kingship was never in Alfred's gift, but clearly the greater amount of landed wealth he could entail on Edward, the stronger he made that son's position in any future contest for the kingship. We must, therefore, treat anything he tells us of the terms of the disputed inheritance of his rival nephews with the utmost caution, if not scepticism. The support which Alfred tells us he received from the witan counts for little. As king, Alfred controlled immense patronage in relation to his thegns, who stood to benefit from backing their lord against claims which his nephews made on his property. It is <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> case ever came before the witan at all. That it did, suggests that Æthelhelm and Æthelwold were by then young men who commanded some independent support and sympathy in Wessex.|$|E

500|$|DKP {{systems were}} first {{designed}} for Everquest in 1999 by Thott {{as part of}} the creation of a guild called [...] "Afterlife" [...] and named for two dragons, Lady Vox and Lord Nagafen. Since then, it has been adapted for use in other similar online games, in World of Warcraft for example an Avatar named Dragonkiller started its popular use and other programmers designed applications so that the system could work in game as an application to track data for achievements made. Unlike pen and paper or more traditional role-playing video games, massively multiplayer online games could present challenges so <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number of players required to defeat them would greatly exceed the number of items awarded to the raid following the boss kill—a raid of 25 individuals may only see two or three items 'drop'. [...] The actual number of players required to defeat a specific boss varies from game to game, but the person-hours invested are non-trivial. [...] Raid encounters may involve [...] "10-200 players organized to achieve a common goal over a period of typically around 3-6 continuous hours" [...] and demand teamwork and competence from all raid members.|$|E
500|$|The date of {{construction}} {{of the church is}} uncertain, but it is a medieval building, probably from the 15th century. The 19th-century clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones thought that the church was probably 16th-century in date, but might have been built using material from an older structure. The historian Antony Carr has suggested that Llanfair-yn-y-Cwmwd was the church dedicated to St Mary that was sacked by Normans in 1157. [...] St Mary's was formerly one of the chapels of ease to St Nidan's, Llanidan, along with St Deiniol's, Llanddaniel Fab and St Edwen's, Llanedwen. [...] St Nidan's and its chapels were owned by the Augustinian priory at Beddgelert, Gwynedd; the date of transfer is uncertain, since not all the records have survived, but St Nidan's is mentioned as belonging to the priory in a charter of 1360. [...] Carr has written that [...] "we shall never know" [...] how the [...] "distant community" [...] in Beddgelert came to possess the four Anglesey churches, but thought that it might be <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> priory also controlled two churches on the mainland, {{on the other side of}} the Menai Strait.|$|E
500|$|The third {{attempt to}} poison Litvinenko {{took place at}} around 5pm of 1 November in the Millennium Hotel in Grosvenor Square. The bus he {{travelled}} in to the hotel had no signs of radioactivity – but large amounts had been detected at the hotel. Polonium was subsequently found in a fourth-floor room and in a cup in the Pine Bar at the hotel. After the Millennium bar, Litvinenko stopped {{at the office of}} Boris Berezovsky. He used a fax machine, where radioactive contamination was found later. At 6pm, Akhmed Zakayev picked Litvinenko up and brought him home to Muswell Hill. The amount of radioactivity left by Litvinenko in the car was so <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> car was rendered unusable. Everything that he touched at home during the next three days [...] was contaminated. His family was unable to return to the house even six months later. His wife tested positive for ingesting polonium, but did not leave a secondary trail behind her. This suggested that anyone who left a trail could not have picked up the polonium from Litvinenko (possibly, including Lugovoy and Kovtun). The patterns and levels of radioactivity the assassins left behind suggested that Litvinenko ingested polonium, whereas Lugovoy and Kovtun handled it directly. The human body dilutes polonium before excreting it in sweat, which results in a reduced radioactivity level. There were also traces of Po-210 found at the Hey Jo/Abracadabra bar, Dar Marrakesh restaurant, and Lambeth-Mercedes taxis.|$|E

2500|$|Next, King {{considered}} {{whether the}} ordinance was vague {{in all its}} possible applications.
