50|$|The SmartFile design uses a {{standard}} VHS tape, with an innovative <b>stick-on</b> <b>label</b> {{that contains a}} small memory chip. The VCR contains a sensor that is able to wirelessly access the data on this memory chip, and display it on the TV.|$|E
5000|$|The only {{copies of}} the album that exist are full length promotional copies, none of which include the publicized album cover. There are two variations: one is an acetate promo which has a <b>stick-on</b> <b>label</b> and comes in an orange jewel case. The other comes in a {{cardboard}} sleeve and features Lefton in a T-shirt with a jolly roger on it. A three song sampler also exists which plays the songs [...] "My Hit Song," [...] "Ozone" [...] and [...] "Sugar Daddy".|$|E
5000|$|When signed, the Beha clocks bore {{two types}} of identifications; either a <b>stick-on</b> <b>label</b> which {{would be on the}} case back-board {{on the inside of the}} case or the name [...] "Beha" [...] {{engraved}} on one of the two brass fuseé drum ends. However, it is necessary to emphasize that most of the Beha timepieces were not signed and it is almost impossible to identify a Beha based on the case alone. The case makers that supplied Beha with their cases, sold identical cases to other manufacturers too. So today we can find identical cases, but in fact they were not made by the Beha enterprise. For example, Aaron Ketterer and Theodor Ketterer frequently used the Beha designed and their cases are nearly identical. That is why the mechanism is the crucial part to give a positive attribution.|$|E
50|$|Visa formats in Australia {{have changed}} over the years. Australia was {{possibly}} {{one of the first}} countries to replace ink based stamps with more secure <b>stick-on</b> <b>labels</b> in the 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|LightScribe is {{an optical}} disc {{recording}} technology {{that was created}} by the Hewlett-Packard Company. It uses specially coated recordable CD and DVD media to produce laser-etched labels with text or graphics, as opposed to <b>stick-on</b> <b>labels</b> and printable discs. Although HP no longer is developing the technology it is still maintained and supported by a number of independent enthusiasts.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} LightScribe {{is to allow}} users to create direct-to-disc labels (as opposed to <b>stick-on</b> <b>labels),</b> using their optical disc writer. Special discs and a {{compatible}} disc writer are required. Before or after burning data to the read-side of the disc, the user turns the disc over and inserts it with the label side down. The drive's laser then etches into the label side {{in such a way}} that an image is produced.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the 'Diana' labeled cameras, there are over fifty similar variants of the basic design, {{some of which may}} have been produced by other factories and/or manufacturers. The camera was sold under a variety of model names, often accomplished by merely affixing a different <b>stick-on</b> <b>label</b> to the same product. [...] In other cases, slight modifications to the basic design were incorporated. Some Diana clones use a slightly different molding and plastic composition, while other models have a 'bulb' setting for time exposures. Other variants incorporate a 6×6 cm negative size (like the Diana Deluxe), while others have provision for different controls or even separate flash illumination. The 3 aperture version of the classic Diana/Diana clone has apertures of , , and , and it takes 32 mm clip-on filters. The Diana Deluxe variant offers , , and , and takes a 46-49 mm step-up ring, unusual for such a low-end camera. The modern Diana F+ offers four apertures, including a pinhole. Shutter speed is often variable due to manufacturing vagaries, and can vary from 1/200th to 1/30th of a second. [...] As there is no shutter lock, and the shutter mechanism is always held in tension by a spring, multiple exposures with the Diana can be achieved by multiple operations of the shutter release without advancing the film.|$|E
50|$|The method engages {{different}} {{learning styles}} (visual, auditory and kinesthetic) with computer software games, audio CDs, sticky <b>labels</b> (peel-off <b>stick-on</b> vocabulary <b>labels),</b> cut-out menu guides, flashcards and word games.|$|R
25|$|Electric Pencil, {{released}} in December 1976, {{was the first}} word processor software for microcomputers. Software-based word processors running on general-purpose personal computers gradually displaced dedicated word processors, and the term came to refer to software rather than hardware. Some programs were modeled after particular dedicated WP hardware. MultiMate, for example, was written for an insurance company that had hundreds of typists using Wang systems, and spread from there to other Wang customers. To adapt to the smaller, more generic PC keyboard, MultiMate used <b>stick-on</b> <b>labels</b> and a large plastic clip-on template to remind users of its dozens of Wang-like functions, using the shift, alt and ctrl keys with the 10 IBM function keys {{and many of the}} alphabet keys.|$|R
5000|$|MultiMate was not marketed {{heavily to}} end-users, but was quickly popular with {{insurance}} companies, law firms, other business computer users and US {{government agencies and}} the military. While the Wang WP keyboard {{was different from the}} original PC keyboard, MultiMate compensated by providing a large plastic template that clipped on the PC keyboard, and <b>stick-on</b> <b>labels</b> for the fronts of the PC keys. The template and labels color-coded the combination keystrokes using the SHIFT, ALT and CTRL keys with all 10 of the PC's function keys and many of the character keys. Like Wang systems, MultiMate controlled most editing operations with function keys, assigning four functions to each of the 10 function keys, which IBM initially located at {{the left side of the}} keyboard in two vertical rows. It also included a [...] "document summary" [...] screen for each document, another Wang feature, which allowed more sophisticated document-management than the brief file names allowed by MS-DOS and PC DOS. As Drop-down lists were popularized by other programs, they became a later addition to MultiMate.|$|R
