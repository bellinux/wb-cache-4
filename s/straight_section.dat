5|$|Delambre used a {{baseline}} of about 10km in length along a straight road, located close to Melun. In an operation taking six weeks, the baseline was accurately measured using four platinum rods, each of length two toise (about 3.9m). Thereafter he used, where possible, the triangulation points used by Cassini in his 1744 survey of France. Méchain's baseline, {{of a similar}} length, and also on a <b>straight</b> <b>section</b> of road was in the Perpignan area. Although Méchain's sector was half the length of Delambre, it included the Pyrenees and hitherto unsurveyed parts of Spain. After the two surveyors met, each computed the other's baseline in order to cross-check their results and they then recomputed the kilometre. Their result came out at 0.144lignes shorter than the provisional value, a difference of about 0.03%.|$|E

5|$|The Ridge Route {{crosses the}} West Branch California Aqueduct with SR 138, {{splitting}} {{to the northwest}} on Gorman Post Road. It rejoins the path of I-5 at Gorman, and, from Gorman to the end at Grapevine, most of the old road has been covered over by the Ridge Route Alternate or I-5. The path of the Ridge Route is now named Peace Valley Road and Lebec Road, passing over Tejon Pass and past Lebec and Fort Tejon. Past Fort Tejon, the route descends through Grapevine Canyon to Grapevine (named for grapevines in the area). The best-known curve on the road, Deadman's Curve or Death Curve, is visible from Digier Road {{on the west side}} of I-5. The next part of the old road that still exists is near the bottom of the grade, where a number of curves brought the road down to Grapevine. The original plan was to build the road nearer to the center of the canyon, but a March1914 flood destroyed the work, and the grading was redone higher up. Deadman's Curve and the Grapevine loops were both bypassed by the Ridge Route Alternate, which was built directly over most of the old road in this area. At Grapevine, the land suddenly flattens out, and the road north of Grapevine was the longest <b>straight</b> <b>section</b> of road in the state——in 1926.

The blacktip trevally has 24 to 27 gill rakers and 24 vertebrae.|$|E
25|$|The dorsal and ventral {{profiles}} of the fish are nearly evenly , with the two lines intersecting at the pointed snout. There are two separate dorsal fins; the first consisting of eight moderately high spines and the second of a single spine followed by 22 to 25 soft rays.

The terminal soft rays of both the anal and dorsal fins are nearly {{twice as long as}} the penultimate rays, forming distinctive finlet-like structures, although are still attached to the main fin structure by interradial membranes. The lateral line is slightly arched anteriorally, with the intersection of the curved and <b>straight</b> <b>section</b> occurring below the sixth to eighth dorsal soft ray. The curved section contains between 39 and 57 scales, while the <b>straight</b> <b>section</b> has no to 10 scales and 36 to 49 scutes. Another of the major distinguishing features of the species is an adipose eyelid which fully encloses the eye except for a small vertical slit over the pupil. This feature is only observable in individuals greater than 10cm, as juveniles below this length are still developing the eyelid. Both jaws have a single row of small teeth, although two or three rows of small canine teeth are present in older individuals. There are 37 to 44 gill rakers in total and 24 vertebrae.

50|$|During the {{construction}} of the NSLS, two scientists, Renate Chasman and George Kenneth Green, invented a special periodic arrangement of magnetic elements (a magnetic lattice) to provide optimized bending and focusing of electrons. The design was called the Chasman-Green lattice, and it became the basis of design for every synchrotron storage ring. Storage rings are characterized by the number of <b>straight</b> <b>sections</b> and bend sections in their design. The bend sections produce more light than the <b>straight</b> <b>sections</b> due to the change in angular momentum of the electrons. Chasman and Green accounted for this in their design by adding insertion devices, known as wigglers and undulators, in the <b>straight</b> <b>sections</b> of the storage ring. These insertion devices produce the brightest light among the sections of the ring and thus, beamlines are typically built downstream from them.|$|R

40|$|The Green-Chasman lattice, {{which is}} the basis for both NSLS storage rings, was {{conceived}} with insertion devices in mind. Long, field-free <b>straight</b> <b>sections</b> were provided in the design.

This design concept has been followed by all high-brightness rings which were built subsequent to the NSLS. The X-Ray Ring <b>straight</b> <b>sections</b> also have a very small vertical {beta} function, in addition to the zero dispersion. This was done to optimize the brightness of wiggler sources. There is a further benefit however. The {beta} function determines the beam size and divergence at a particular point in the storage ring lattice.

Over the next few years, Walker suggested two new routes for the Higham to Strood stretch, for which Acts of Parliament were obtained and money raised. His second route was decided on but required a tunnel through the chalk hills; work on this did not start until 1819.
