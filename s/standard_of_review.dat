The Court's endorsement of strict scrutiny was much less ambiguous in Government of Malaysia v. V.R. Menon (1990). It held that the impugned Act was concerned with economic and social welfare and not fundamental rights, and therefore the trial judge had erred in applying a stricter <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>review.</b> As such, the court implicitly endorsed the application of the strict scrutiny test in cases concerning fundamental rights in Malaysia.|$|E

5000|$|This is in {{contrast}} to more relaxed <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>review</b> such as [...] "clearly erroneous" [...] or [...] "substantial evidence."

40|$|In this article, I {{discuss a}} flaw in Brazilian civil {{procedure}} observed in my practice as a Federal Labor Judge in Brazil, an issue that may be addressed by limiting appellate review {{in a similar fashion}} as the American courts do, using <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> appellate <b>review.</b> In Brazil, appellate courts tend to ignore the lower court’s decisions, replacing them for the ruling they would have made had they been the original decision makers. A simple disagreement with the lower court’s findings of fact or discretionary rulings, no matter how reasonable, is sufficient grounds for reversal. The lack <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>review</b> results in duplication of the trial court’s work at the appellate level, and provides excessive incentives for the parties to appeal. Parties often gamble for a different judgment, given the high odds of reversal that result from the lack <b>of</b> deferential <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>review.</b> With such restrictive standards, the quantity and processing time of appeals would likely decline, relieving the overburdened Brazilian courts. The introduction <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>review</b> in Brazil would not face legal impediments. They are consistent with constitutional due process guarantees, such as the reasonable duration of process, and with the recent statutory reforms that limit the types and scope of appeals, and strengthen precedents. Additionally, the lack of an express statutory basis does not prevent Brazilian courts from performing a more deferential appellate review, notwithstanding the desirability of a nationally binding statute or court regulation, to achieve consistency. Changes in legal culture, such as the long-standing unrestricted appellate review in Brazil, are not easy, but the resulting flood of often trivial appeals impose a change in that paradigm...|$|R
40|$|Why would a {{district}} court judge write about or revise an appellate court judge’s work on appellate <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>review</b> and related propositions of law in civil cases? Well, two reasons – a change in legal mind set and fifteen years’ worth of changes in appellate practice. First, and foremost, when Judge Irwin collected in a single work his 1992 <b>Standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>Review</b> and Propositions <b>of</b> Law, Civil, {{he was the first}} in recent Nebraska legal history to do so. Those of us who have used his work owe him our thanks; his contribution was invaluable to both the bench and bar of that time. At that time, the Nebraska Court of Appeals had just commenced operation. Up until that year, the district courts, in reality, had been Nebraska’s only intermediate courts of appeals from the county courts, but weren’t yet conceptualized as intermediate courts of appeals when hearing appeals from county courts. That district courts weren’t yet seen as sitting as intermediate appellate courts when hearing appeals from county courts was a historical carry over from earlier times. In 1972, the legislature reorganized the county courts and increased their jurisdiction, making them a major trial court, abolished all the various local courts (such as the justice of the peace courts, police courts, etc.) and relocated their jurisdiction in the county courts, and, transferred exclusive juvenile jurisdiction from the district courts to the county courts (outside of Douglas, Lancaster, and Sarpy Counties). Until 1972, appeals from county courts and the other local courts were tried de novo in the district courts (unless someone committed the tactical error of taking the judgments of the county courts and local courts to the district courts by petition in error). LB 1032 (1972) changed that scenario, but the mind set that district court was just a trial court that retried county court cases when appealed hung on for some time after 1972. The Nebraska Supreme Court and the Nebraska Court of Appeals both have worked diligently to change that pre- 1972 mind set. The supreme court and court of appeals continuously have taught that, when hearing appeals from county courts, the district courts act in the capacity of intermediate appellate courts. The Nebraska Supreme Court and the Nebraska Court of Appeals both have emphasized that, when acting as intermediate appellate courts, the district courts must apply the proper appellate <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>review.</b> District courts conducting first level Administrative Procedure Act judicial <b>reviews</b> <b>of</b> agency actions behave more closely to their traditional trial court roles, but still must apply appellate <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>review.</b> On appeal from the district courts’ APA judicial <b>reviews,</b> different appellate <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>review</b> may apply. In hearing error proceedings, another form <b>of</b> appellate <b>review</b> district courts perform at the first review level, the district courts must apply a different set <b>of</b> appellate <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>review</b> than they apply in APA cases. Thus, {{district court judge}}s must be aware of and appreciate the operation of the applicable appellate <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>review</b> at the district court level. Counsel and appellate litigants must be aware of and appreciate the operation of the applicable appellate <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>review</b> at all appellate levels. The second, and likely more obvious, reason one would update and revise Judge Irwin’s 1992 work lies in the evolution in Nebraska’s civil appeals practice in the fifteen-plus years since he wrote; nearly a revolution in some areas. We’re pushing up against the end of Thomas Jefferson’s idea of a generation (roughly a period of nineteen years) since Judge Irwin wrote. Major changes have occurred in some areas of civil appellate practice. Major very recent changes have occurred in civil trial practice which inevitably require more changes in civil appellate practice. What use should readers make of both editions of this collection? Judge Irwin did not offer analysis in the printed version of his edition nor do I in mine. This document should be used as a finding, or access, tool to locate the information collected herein, information which is difficult to locate in the digests and online research tools. Judge Irwin used an alphabetical arrangement; I have retained that organizational approach.

2500|$|The Silicon Valley Taxpayers case is {{also one}} of the most {{important}} and significant taxpayer protection cases in a generation (and is listed as one of the most important and influential decisions in the history of the California Supreme Court) in large part because of the California Supreme Court holding on the <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>review</b> issue.
