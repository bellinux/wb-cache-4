Compared with the conventional piezoresistive pressure sensors, {{the new one}} reported in this paper has an n-type <b>shield</b> <b>layer</b> that covers p-type piezoresistors. This <b>shield</b> <b>layer</b> aims to minimize the impact of electrical field and reduce the temperature sensitivity of piezoresistors. The proposed sensors have been successfully fabricated by bulk-micromachining techniques. A sensitivity of 0. 022 mV/V/kPa and a maximum non-linearity of 0. 085 % FS are obtained in a pressure range of 1 MPa.

40|$|AbstractHigh Temperature Superconducting (HTS) {{power cable}} {{consists}} of a conducting <b>layer</b> and a <b>shield</b> <b>layer</b> for carrying the required current. Geometrically, the conducting and <b>shield</b> <b>layers</b> each have self inductance; and the mutual inductance exists between the conducting and <b>shield</b> <b>layers.</b> Therefore, {{the direction of the}} current of <b>shield</b> the <b>layer</b> is opposite that of the conducting layer current. The value of the <b>shield</b> <b>layer</b> current is over 95 % of the conducting layer current at the steady state. However, if a fault current passes through an HTS power cable, the quench occurs in both the conducting and <b>shield</b> <b>layers.</b> After the quench, resistance appears, and the even self inductance values are not changed a great deal, but the mutual inductance value is directly affected. According to the above mentioned processes, the current distribution of the conducting and <b>shield</b> <b>layers</b> changes due to the fault current. In this paper, the authors describe the transient state analysis of a real manufactured HTS power model cable, considering both the conducting and the <b>shield</b> <b>layers.</b> The manufactured system is coupled with RTDS, in which a utility grid is composed and simulated. These results provide important data for the design of an HTS power cable...|$|R

When the electrical tree propagates into the nonlinear <b>shielding</b> <b>layer</b> sandwiched between insulation layers of cable, the electric field distribution near the tip of electrical tree is obviously improved.

40|$|When an {{electromagnetic}} signal transmits through a coaxial cable, it propagates at speed {{determined by the}} dielectrics of insulator between the cooper core wire and the metallic shield. However, we demonstrate here that, once the <b>shielding</b> <b>layer</b> of the coaxial cable is cut into two parts leaving a small gap, while the copper core wire is still perfectly connected, a remarkable transmission delay immediately appears in the system. We have revealed by both computational simulation and experiments that, when the gap spacing between {{two parts of the}} <b>shielding</b> <b>layer</b> is small, this delay is mostly determined by the overall geometrical parameters of the conductive boundary which connects two parts of the cut <b>shielding</b> <b>layer.</b> A reduced analytic formula for the transmission delay related with geometrical parameters, which is based on an inductive model of the transmission system, matches well with the fitted formula of the simulated delay. This above structure is analog to the situation that an interconnect is between two inter-modules in a circuit. The results suggest that for high speed circuits and systems, parasitic inductance should be taken into full consideration, and compact conductive packaging is favorable for reducing transmission delay of inter-modules, therefore enhancing the performance of the system...|$|R
40|$|NASA is in {{the process}} of {{designing}} the James Webb Space Telescope. This telescope will investigate images of objects in deep space (stars, galaxies, etc.) by using light in the infrared region of the light spectrum. To make such observations, the telescope must have light sensors that operate at very cold temperatures, near absolute zero. To achieve this low-temperature tolerance, designers must place the light sensors behind a <b>Sun</b> <b>shield</b> that will prevent sunlight, and its heat, from reaching the sensors. In this cold region inside the telescope, electric motors and some motor controls must operate at temperatures near 40 K (40 degrees above absolute zero). These motors will be used to position light filters needed by the telescope. There are motors that operate at the low temperatures, but there is little technology for low-temperature motor-control electronics. The drawing shows how the motors and their controls are positioned behind the <b>Sun</b> <b>shield.</b> Simplified version of the layout of the motor and control electronics that are located, as dictated by mission requirements, in the cold zone of the James Webb Space Telescope. A <b>Sun</b> <b>shield</b> provides protection and isolation of these electronics from the heat of the rays of the sun. Room temperature compoenets (control computer, motor select command, motor phase drive, power supply, parallel to serial, and <b>sun</b> <b>shield)</b> as well as 40 -kelvin components (motor select, serial to parallel, and motors) are shown.

Then, components that were determined to operate successfully at the low temperatures were used to design low-temperature motor-controller circuits. A prototype motor controller circuit was built, evaluated, and demonstrated to operate at 70 K. Next, Glenn researchers plan to determine circuit performance at much colder temperatures [...] down to 40 K.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} and explain the low-energy plasma structures observed by the PLS experiment on Voyager 2 in the Uranian inner magnetosphere, an analytic and self-consistent model of a time-dependent solar-wind driven convection system at Uranus has been developed in the corotating coordinate system. Many important results of this model agree with the observations very well. Because of the unusual orientation of the planetary rotation and magnetic dipole axes, magnetic merging on the dayside magnetopause varies {{as a function of}} planetary spin, in response to the changing orientation of the planetary magnetic field relative to the upstream interplanetary magnetic field, which is assumed to have a fixed direction for many planetary rotations. Therefore the magnitude of the solar-wind driven convection electric field varies sinusoidally in time with the 17. 2 hr planetary spin period, even though the field direction is fixed in the corotating frame in a direction analogous to the dawn-to-dusk direction in the Earth's magnetosphere. By assuming conservation of the first adiabatic invariant we find that the "hot" (few keV) protons observed by the PLS experiment in the inner magnetosphere may be convected Sunward from a pick-up source provided by electron impact ionization of the neutral torus of the outermost satellite Oberon. Under the time-dependent convection field this hot plasma forms a ring-current <b>shielding</b> <b>layer</b> in the region L = 5 âˆ¼ 7, similar to an Alfven layer because the hot plasma convection timescale (âˆ¼ 20 days) is much larger than the 17. 2 hr period of variation of the convection field. Inside of the <b>shielding</b> <b>layer</b> the time-averaged electric field is much smaller than the time average of the imposed field. The sinusoidal oscillation of the imposed electric field, however, is not significantly shielded by the <b>shielding</b> <b>layer</b> because the <b>shielding</b> timescale (âˆ¼ 30 hr) is longer than the 17. 2 hr oscillation period. A fraction of the hot plasma is therefore able to penetrate the <b>shielding</b> <b>layer</b> to form a trapped ring-current population. This trapped ring-current population is sufficiently long-lived to undergo charge-exchange and inelastic collisions with the widely distributed neutral hydrogen corona, resulting in the energy degradation of the "hot" component and the simultaneous appearance of the "intermediate" (few 100 eV) and "warm" (few 10 eV) components evident in the PLS results in the region between L = 5 and L = 7. The region 2 Birkeland current system, in our model, is concentrated near the region of the ring-current <b>shielding</b> <b>layer.</b> By analogy with the Earth's magnetosphere, the lower boundary of the Uranian aurora is predicted by mapping the location of the <b>shielding</b> <b>layer</b> in the magnetic equatorial plane along the magnetospheric magnetic field lines onto the Uranian ionosphere...|$|R

Body core and skin temperatures were measured as well as thermal comfort and thermal sensation of the hands, head and body.
