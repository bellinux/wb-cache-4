If I could repair the tug in any {{reasonable}} length of time, {{it would be another}} matter; but since that can't be done, on account of the damage to the <b>steam-chest,</b> there's a good deal of heavy work ahead." ...|$|E
60|$|The stamp-mill, {{lying to}} the extreme north of the actual workings, is {{supplied}} with water by a leat from the eastern Tákwá rivulet. The twelve head of stamps, on Appleby's 'gravitation system,' are driven by a Belleville boiler and engine; this has the merit of being portable and the demerit of varying in effective power, owing to the smallness of the <b>steam-chest.</b> The battery behaves satisfactorily; only the pump, which is worked by the cam-shaft, wants power to supply the whole dozen; consequently another and independent pump has been ordered. Krumen, who will never, I think, make good mine-workmen, are constantly employed in washing the blankets {{as soon as they}} are charged; and the resulting black sand is carried to the washing-house to be panned, or rather calabashed, by native women. In time we shall doubtless see concentrating bundles and amalgamating barrels.|$|E
40|$|The <b>steam-chest</b> {{molding process}} {{can be used to}} prepare molded bead foams, {{including}} expandable polystyrene (EPS), expanded polyethylene (EPE), expanded polypropylene (EPP), and expanded polylactide (EPLA) with complex three-dimensional shapes. A new thermoplastic elastomer bead foam, which is described as expanded thermoplastic polyurethane (ETPU), now exists. Notably, it has an excellent soft touch quality and is ductile. It has also generated widespread interest in both the academic and industrial communities. In this study, three types of ETPU foams with various sample sizes were <b>steam-chest</b> molded. We concentrated on the preparation of the molded ETPU (METPU), which was followed by a mechanical test. Our morphological observations showed that the ETPU bead foams' interfaces had effectively bonded. A high tensile strength of 1. 80 MPa and an elongation at break of 360. 1 % were reached in the METPU sample with a density of 0. 35 g/cm(3). A 200 -fold cyclic compression measurement verified that the compressed METPU sample could recover more than 95 % both in stress and modulus, after 6 days of relaxation. This suggested the presence of excellent interbead bonding in the ETPU bead foams. Based on the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results, we proposed that a formation mechanism for interbead bonding during the ETPU steam-molding process existed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In this study, {{corrosion}} of {{austenitic stainless}} steels under CH 4 -stream reforming atmosphere was investigated at 800 ºC. Two kinds of {{austenitic stainless steels}}, type 304 (18 Cr- 8 Ni) and 310 (25 Cr- 20 Ni) were exposed into CH 4 -steam gas mixture before reforming reaction and mainly H 2 -CO gas mixture after the reforming reaction. Protective Cr 2 O 3 scale was developed on type 304 under the reformed gas and 310 under the both gas mixtures. Corrosion of type 304 under the <b>steam-CH</b> 4 gas mixture developed thick duplex scale consisting of Fe 2 O 3 /Fe 3 O 4 outer scale and inner scale consisting of (Fe,Cr) 3 O 4 and Cr 2 O 3, {{which is similar with}} that formed by steam oxidation. The corrosion rate of type 304 under the reformed gas is also comparable with steam oxidation. Any carburization was not observed in all of the experiments...|$|R
40|$|Polypropylene (PP) bead foams were {{prepared}} by autoclave foaming using n-pentane and CO 2 as the blowing agents. PP foams blown with n-pentane had foaming temperatures of 92 ？ 96 °C, expansion ratios of 10 ？ 50 times, and a signal Tm at 150. 1 °C, while PP foams blown with CO 2 had foaming temperatures of 151 ？ 153 °C, expansion ratios of 8 ？ 20 times, and dual melting peaks at 164. 0 and 140. 9 °C. Polyethylene (PE) addition {{was used to}} improve the foaming behavior of PP and to induce the formation of dual and multiple Tm in PP/PE foams. A differential scanning calorimetry procedure was carried out to simulate the <b>steam-chest</b> molding of bead foams. Interbead bonding {{was found to be}} determined by the heat of fusion ofTmc (crystal melting of the newly formed crystals during fast cooling),ΔHmc. Recrystallization of the PE component contributed to the increase of ΔHmc, which potentially improved interbead bonding of the molded PP/PE bead foams...|$|E
