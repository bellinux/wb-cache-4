25|$|The broth for beef pho is {{generally}} made by simmering beef bones, oxtails, flank steak, charred onion, charred ginger and spices. For a more intense flavor, the bones {{may still have}} beef on them. Chicken bones also work and produce a similar broth. Seasonings can include <b>Saigon</b> <b>cinnamon</b> or other kinds of cinnamon as alternatives (may use usually in stick form, sometimes in powder form in pho restaurant franchises overseas), star anise, roasted ginger, roasted onion, black cardamom, coriander seed, fennel seed, and clove. The broth takes several hours to make. For chicken pho, only the meat and bones of the chicken are used in place of beef and beef bone. The remaining spices remain the same, but the charred ginger can be omitted, since its function in beef pho is to subdue the quite strong smell of beef.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Saigon</b> <b>{{cinnamon}}</b> (Cinnamomum loureiroi, {{also known}} as Vietnamese cinnamon or Vietnamese cassia and quế trà my, quế thanh, or [...] " [...] quế trà bồng" [...] in Vietnam) is an evergreen tree indigenous to mainland Southeast Asia. Despite its name, <b>Saigon</b> <b>cinnamon</b> is {{more closely related to}} cassia (C. cassia) than to cinnamon (C. verum, “true cinnamon”, Ceylon cinnamon), though in the same genus as both. <b>Saigon</b> <b>cinnamon</b> has 1-5% essential oil in content and 25% cinnamaldehyde in essential oil, which is the highest of all the cinnamon species. Consequently, of the three species, <b>Saigon</b> <b>cinnamon</b> commands the highest price.|$|E

50|$|<b>Saigon</b> <b>cinnamon</b> is {{produced}} primarily in Vietnam, both for domestic use and export. The Vietnam War disrupted production, {{but since the}} beginning of the early 21st century, Vietnam has resumed export of the spice, including to the United States, where it was unavailable for nearly 20 years. Although it is called <b>Saigon</b> <b>cinnamon,</b> it is not produced in the area around the southern city of Saigon, but instead in the central and Central Highlands regions of the country, particularly the Quảng Ngai Province of central Vietnam.|$|E
50|$|<b>Saigon</b> <b>cinnamon</b> {{contains}} the highest amount of coumarin {{of all the}} four Cinnamomum species sold as cinnamon, with one study detecting 6.97 g/kg in an authenticated sample.|$|E
50|$|<b>Saigon</b> <b>cinnamon</b> is used {{primarily}} for its aromatic bark, {{which has a}} taste quite {{similar to that of}} C. cassia, but with a more pronounced and complex aroma.|$|E
5000|$|Chinese cassia is {{produced}} in both China and Vietnam. Until the 1960s, Vietnam was the world's most important producer of <b>Saigon</b> <b>cinnamon,</b> which has a higher oil content , and consequently has a stronger flavor. Because of the disruption caused by the Vietnam War, however, production of Indonesian cassia in the highlands of the Indonesia island of Sumatra was increased to meet demand. [...] Indonesian cassia has the lowest oil content of {{the three types of}} cassia, so commands the lowest price. Chinese cassia has a sweeter flavor than Indonesian cassia, similar to <b>Saigon</b> <b>cinnamon,</b> but with lower oil content.|$|E
50|$|Nam Trà My is a rural {{district}} (huyện) of Quảng Nam Province in the South Central Coast region of Vietnam. The district {{is known for}} its production of <b>Saigon</b> <b>Cinnamon.</b> As of 2003 the district had a population of 19,876. The district covers an area of 822 km².

5000|$|Chinese cassia {{is a close}} {{relative}} to Ceylon cinnamon (C. verum), <b>Saigon</b> <b>cinnamon</b> (C. loureiroi), also known as [...] "Vietnamese cinnamon", Indonesian cinnamon (C. burmannii), also called [...] "korintje", and Malabar cinnamon (C. citriodorum) from Sri Lanka. In all five species, the dried bark {{is used as a}} spice. Chinese cassia's flavour is less delicate than that of Ceylon cinnamon. Its bark is thicker, more difficult to crush, and has a rougher texture than that of Ceylon cinnamon.|$|E

50|$|Vietnamese cuisine {{encompasses}} the foods and beverages of Vietnam, and features {{a combination of}} five fundamental tastes (Vietnamese: ngũ vị) in the overall meal. Each Vietnamese dish has a distinctive flavor which reflects {{one or more of}} these elements. Common ingredients include fish sauce, shrimp paste, soy sauce, rice, fresh herbs, fruit and vegetables. Vietnamese recipes use lemongrass, ginger, mint, Vietnamese mint, long coriander, <b>Saigon</b> <b>cinnamon,</b> bird's eye chili, lime, and Thai basil leaves. Traditional Vietnamese cooking is greatly admired for its fresh ingredients, minimal use of dairy and oil, complementary textures, and reliance on herbs and vegetables. With the balance between fresh herbs and meats and a selective use of spices to reach a fine taste, Vietnamese food is considered one of the healthiest cuisines worldwide.|$|E
50|$|The barks of {{the species}} are easily {{distinguished}} when whole, both in macroscopic and microscopic characteristics. Ceylon cinnamon sticks (quills) have many thin layers and can easily be made into powder using a coffee or spice grinder, whereas cassia sticks are much harder. Indonesian cinnamon is often sold in neat quills made up of one thick layer, capable of damaging a spice or coffee grinder. <b>Saigon</b> <b>cinnamon</b> (C. loureiroi) and Chinese cinnamon (C. cassia) are always sold as broken pieces of thick bark, as the bark is not supple enough to be rolled into quills. The powdered bark is harder to distinguish, {{but if it is}} treated with tincture of iodine (a test for starch), little effect is visible with pure Ceylon cinnamon, but when Chinese cinnamon is present, a deep-blue tint is produced.|$|E
