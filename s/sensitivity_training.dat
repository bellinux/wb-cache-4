5|$|Meanwhile, the {{homicide}} department is requiring all the detectives to take <b>sensitivity</b> <b>training</b> with therapist Carry Westin (Jennifer Mendenhall). While {{most of them}} have positive experiences with her, Bolander (Ned Beatty) flatly refuses to participate and repeatedly avoids their scheduled sessions. When Gee (Yaphet Kotto) tells Bolander he will be suspended without pay if he does not meet with her, Bolander chooses the suspension, but later reconsiders after his partner Munch (Richard Belzer) harasses him at the bar until he changes his mind. When they finally meet, Bolander explains he does not trust therapists because when going through marriage counseling with his ex-wife, the therapist actively encouraged her to leave Bolander. He feels he was cheated out of $7,000 in therapy bills, but Westin explains his anger is not from the money, but from feelings of betrayal by his ex-wife. Bolander is ultimately impressed by Westin and even decides to ask her on a date, but she strongly hints she is a lesbian.|$|E

40|$|Conventionally, a radial basis {{function}} (RBF) {{network is}} constructed by obtaining cluster centers of basis function by maximum likelihood learning. This paper proposes a novel learning algorithm {{for the construction}} of radial basis function using <b>sensitivity</b> analysis.

In classification, the minimal number of such hidden neurons with the maximal sensitivity will be the most generalizable to unknown data. Our experimental results show that our proposed sensitivity-based RBF classifier outperforms the conventional RBFs and is as accurate as support vector machine (SVM). Hence, sensitivity analysis {{is expected to be a}} new alternative way to the construction of RBF networks...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} {{was to develop a}} {{welcoming}} clinical environment for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) patients at Northern Counties Health Care (NCHC) and to {{serve as a model for}} community health centers across the nation that want to provide their LGBT communities with patient centered care that is affordable, compassionate and accessible. This was achieved by revising non-discrimination policies and new patient forms to be more inclusive of sexual orientations and gender identities, incorporating LGBT health learning modules into yearly provider and staff mandatories, and adding LGBT inclusive material into all waiting and exam rooms. The effectiveness of these interventions was evaluated using the Healthcare Equality Index (HEI) scoring criteria developed by the Human Rights Campaign. Future interventions include registering competent and <b>sensitivity</b> <b>trained</b> providers to the GLMA (Health Professionals Advancing LGBT Equality) provider directory, including data fields for sexual orientation and gender identity as part of the electronic health record (EHR) for all patients, conducting a community needs assessment with local LGBT groups such as Outright Vermont and NEK LGBTQ Advocacy Committee, developing a partnership with the DHMC Transgender Clinic for additional training in the management of hormone therapies, and measuring LGBT patient satisfaction through phone interviews.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of globalisation, all firms, large or small have become global, they ceased to be local. Even those organisations who {{consider}} themselves immune to transactions across geographical boundaries {{are connected to the}} wider network globally and this has encouraged many multinational companies to extend their operations to other countries by establishing subsidiary companies in other countries. For these companies to do well, sound human capital management practices must be embraced. This paper therefore examines the conceptual analysis of global human resource management practices, it functions and challenges. It is a conceptual paper that is based on review of scholarly articles. Objectives of the paper include; creating a local appeal without compromising the global identity; generating awareness of crosscultural sensitivities among managers globally and hiring of staff across geographical boundaries; and upon cultural <b>sensitivities,</b> <b>training</b> and development for the host communities. It is therefore concluded that success lies in a firm’s ability to build a unique competitive advantage against others. This competitive advantage will last longer if it is within the human capital of the organization rather than just a technology that others can buy. To become and remain competitive globally, it is recommended that a multinational enterprise acquaint itself with the various environmental settings that are likely to inhibit its success and design ways to beat them in advance...|$|R

Tracy and Jack point out that the African-American community has adopted the word to deprive it of its meaning.

40|$|People {{consistently}} show {{preferences and}} behaviors that benefit others {{at a cost}} to themselves, a phenomenon termed altruism. We investigated if perception of one’s body signals – interoception - may be underlying such behaviors. We tested if participants’ sensitivity to their own heartbeat predicted their decision on a choice between self-interest and altruism, and if improving this <b>sensitivity</b> through <b>training</b> would make participants more altruistic. Across these two experiments, interoceptive sensitivity predicted altruism measured through monetary generosity. Improving interoceptive sensitivity did, however, not lead to more altruistic behaviour. We conclude that there is a unique link between interoception and altruistic behaviour, likely established over an individual’s history of altruistic acts, and the body responses they elicit. The findings suggest that humans might literally ‘listen to their heart’ to guide their altruistic behavior...|$|R

We analyzed the binary maps with the optimality method {{in order to identify}} areas of endemism and compare our results regarding previous analyses. The majority of the species tend to have very low values for the minimum training presence, whereas most of the species have a value of the tenth percentile training presence around 0. 5, and the equal <b>training</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and specificity was around 0. 3.
