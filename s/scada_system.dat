40|$|AbstractSupervisory Control and Data Acquisition (<b>SCADA)</b> <b>systems</b> {{are widely}} used in {{critical}} infrastructures and contemporary industrial processes. The advancements and increased interconnections lure the adversary to plunder the reliable operations of these systems. As the persistent monitoring and remote control is necessary to ensure reliable operations of the system, fortifying the security features of <b>SCADA</b> <b>systems</b> is crucial. In this paper, by considering the efficiency requirements in such networks, we propose a key establishment scheme for <b>SCADA</b> <b>systems</b> based on polynomial key distribution scheme. In this new approach, secret key is not transmitted in the network for any device to device communications. The proposed key establishment scheme supports broadcasting, multicasting, join and leave operations and secure communications between and across MTU-SUBMTU-Field devices of <b>SCADA</b> <b>systems.</b> The scheme also considers the constraints such as communication overhead, performance, bandwidth and accuracy to provide an elegant key establishment scheme for <b>SCADA</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

Such an attack has already occurred, carried out on Maroochy Shire Council's sewage control system in Queensland, Australia. [...] Shortly after a contractor installed a <b>SCADA</b> <b>system</b> in January 2000, system components began to function erratically. Pumps did not run when needed and alarms were not reported.
