5|$|Fish ovaries may be {{of three}} types: gymnovarian, {{secondary}} gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the oocytes are released directly into the coelomic cavity and then enter the ostium, then through the oviduct and are eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed ova into the coelom from which they go directly into the oviduct. In the third type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the oviduct. Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in lungfish, sturgeon, and bowfin. Cystovaries characterize most teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct. Secondary gymnovaries are found in <b>salmonids</b> {{and a few other}} teleosts.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} {{significant}} diversity of <b>salmonids</b> present in the bay. Steelhead populations in California have dramatically declined due to human and natural causes; in the Bay Area, all naturally spawned anadromous steelhead populations below natural and manmade impassable barriers in California streams from the Russian River to Aptos Creek, and the drainages of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun Bays are listed as threatened under the Federal Endangered Species Act. The Central California Coast coho salmon population is the most endangered of the many troubled salmon populations {{on the west coast}} of the United States, including populations residing in tributaries to the San Francisco Bay. Industrial, mining, and other uses of mercury have resulted in a widespread distribution of that poisonous metal in the bay, with uptake in the bay's phytoplankton and contamination of its sportfish.|$|E

5|$|Of the 28 {{fish species}} {{present in the}} forest, 11 are not native and have been {{introduced}} by humans. Rainbow trout, chinook salmon, westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, and mountain whitefish are all native {{to some of the}} forest's waterways, while brook trout are a common invasive species that compete with the forest's <b>salmonids.</b> The forest's management indicator species is bull trout because they are sensitive to habitat changes and depend on specific habitat conditions. Sockeye salmon are native to the Salmon River watershed {{in the northern part of}} the forest, but dam construction on the Columbia and Snake rivers has hampered the migration of this anadromous fish and caused its population to collapse. Warm Lake supports the forest's only native population of Kokanee salmon, the resident (non-migratory) form of sockeye salmon. However, due to introductions by humans, Anderson Ranch, Arrowrock, Lucky Peak, and Deadwood reservoirs now support populations of Kokanee salmon. To provide additional recreational fishing opportunities, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game stocks several of the forest's waterways with rainbow trout, while reservoirs are also stocked with Kokanee or chinook salmon and Lake Cascade is stocked with coho salmon and steelhead, the anadromous form of rainbow trout.|$|E

40|$|Worldwide native <b>salmonid</b> {{populations are}} {{reported}} to be in decline. Habitat degradation, and increased anthropogenic fine sediment input in aquatic ecosystems is an important contributing factor. Suspended fine sediment can directly impair the health of free swimming juvenile <b>salmonid</b> fish, either by causing direct physical damage and/or via turbidity. Deposited fine sediment can hinder oxygen supply to <b>salmonid</b> embryos and hence impair their survival. Numerous studies have been published so far. Despite this, we still lack an integrated understanding of how fine sediment affects <b>salmonid</b> fish {{at different stages of}} their life-cycle. My thesis contributes to such an integrated understanding in juvenile <b>salmonid</b> fish (Part 1), and for <b>salmonid</b> embryo survival (Part 2). In part 1, we could demonstrate with an in vivo exposure that pulses of suspended mica clay particles affect rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) mostly via turbidity. Moreover, we found that (i.) rainbow trout could adapt within days when they cannot avoid sediment plumes, and (ii.) that exposure over 24 days can cause cellular changes in inner organs and metabolic stress, even when gill damage is absent and effects on condition are moderate. Altogether, this experiment provides the first systemic investigation of suspended mineral particle pulse effects in a <b>salmonid</b> fish. In an in vitro exposure with the epithelial gill cell-line RTgill-W 1 we could, to my knowledge, demonstrate for the first time (i.) that natural mineral particles can cause cytotoxic effects in gill epithelial cells, and (ii.) that clay particles are more cytotoxic than framework silicates. Further, the clay particles differed in the kind of cytotoxic effects induced, causing either oxidative stress or cell membrane damage. Most interesting, our results are the first empirical evidence that clay particles could induce comparable cytotoxic effects in gill epithelial cells than synthetic nano-particles In part 2, a field experiment provides an integrated perspective on the factors affecting brown trout embryo survival in a channelized river. The introduced steps created a repetitive step-pool-glide morphology (“terraces”). Up to hatch <b>salmonid</b> embryos incubate in distinct gravel nest (“redds”), and during this phase they depend on sufficient oxygen supply. Both fine sediment and a modified river structure can affect hyporheic exchange, and hence embryo survival. For such modified rivers, our experiment is, to my knowledge, the first (i.) to characterize the factors affecting fine sediment deposition, water exchange and oxygen concentrations in <b>salmonid</b> redds, and (ii.) to explicitly identify important predictors for <b>salmonid</b> embryo survival. We found that river morphology and flow dynamics causing fine sediment re-suspension, rather than fine sediment transport per se, were important for maintaining redd gravel permeability over most of the incubation season. Similarly, water exchange and oxygen concentrations in the redds were mostly controlled by processes driven on the intermediate (i. e. individual terraces) and/or regional scale (i. e. river channel). Gravel permeability and the distance of the redd to the next upstream step, which created constant upwelling of short-residence hyporheic water, were the most important predictors for brown trout embryo survival. Altogether, we demonstrated (i.) that artificial steps could benefit <b>salmonid</b> embryo survival in channelized and (ii.) that appropriate flow dynamics and river structure are essential for sustaining <b>salmonid</b> incubation success. My thesis clearly illustrates that it is essential to apply a holistic perspective to understand how fine sediment can affect <b>salmonid</b> fish. My results show that numerous factors can contribute. Fine sediment effects in juvenile <b>salmonid</b> fish could be modulated by exposure concentration and duration, the geochemical composition of the particles, but also adaptive responses of the organism. For fine sediment effects on <b>salmonid</b> embryo survival, the particular river system, with its hydrological and geomorphological setting, as well as the developmental stage of the embryo has to be considered. I believe we ultimately need to integrate fine sediment as one aspect of environmental change, and from there to develop strategies to sustain <b>salmonid</b> populations in the 21 st century. ...|$|R

25|$|Farmed <b>salmonids</b> can, {{and often}} do, escape from sea cages. If the farmed salmonid is not native, it {{can compete with}} native wild species for food and habitat. If the farmed salmonid is native, it can interbreed with the wild native <b>salmonids.</b> Such interbreeding can reduce genetic diversity, disease {{resistance}} and adaptability. In 2004, about 500,000 salmon and trout escaped from ocean net pens off Norway. Around Scotland, 600,000 salmon were released during storms. Commercial fishermen targeting wild salmon not infrequently catch escaped farm salmon. At one stage, in the Faroe Islands, 20 to 40 percent of all fish caught were escaped farm salmon.|$|E

40|$|Three {{families}} of tRNA-derived repeated retroposons in the genomes of <b>salmonid</b> {{species have been}} isolated and characterized.

The third family, the <b>salmonid</b> Hpa I family, appears to be present in all <b>salmonid</b> species but is not present in species that are not members of the Salmonidae. Thus, the genome of proto-Salmonidae was originally shaped by amplification and dispersion of the <b>salmonid</b> Hpa I family and then reshaped by amplification of the Sma I and Fok I families in the more recently evolved species of salmon and charr, respectively.

40|$|Criteria used to {{characterize}} lotic <b>salmonid</b> habitat are {{often based on}} observed correlations between physical habitat characteristics and <b>salmonid</b> abundances.

This study outlines {{the development of a}} habitat assessment approach that focuses on how invertebrate food availability interacts with stream temperatures to determine <b>salmonid</b> growth potentials. Abundances of benthic and drifting invertebrate communities, stream temperatures, and juvenile steelhead trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss gairdneri) summer growth rates and abundances were measured within 10 distinct stream segments in central Oregon. Stream temperatures and growth rates were used as inputs for bioenergetics model simulations to produce estimates of O. mykiss summer consumption rates. Measures of invertebrates providing the best description of food availability were chosen based on their ability to explain observed variation in <b>salmonid</b> consumption. Much of the variation in O. mykiss consumption estimates was explained by measurements of total drift biomass along a type II predator response curve. A random effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to partition variation in invertebrate abundances across spatial and temporal scales. Quantification of variation at multiple scales allowed identification of a relevant spatial scale at which to assess macroinvertebrates relevant to <b>salmonid</b> populations, and compare the precision associated with measures of benthic and drifting invertebrate abundances. Results suggested that spatial variation in drifting and benthic invertebrate abundances are greatest at the scale of streams. Total drift biomass and total benthic biomass were more precise at the stream and stream reach scale than drift and benthic density.
