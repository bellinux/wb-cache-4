30|$|GL {{pretreatment}} {{was developed}} for semi-chemical and kraft cookings in 1970 s. It was reported that southern pine is cooked by GL containing about 29  % total alkali charge to give a pulp with a yield of about 70  % [1]. After the concept of extended delignification was developed [2], GL pretreatment was reported to improve its selectivity and pulp quality [3, 4]. Later, GL pretreatment of wood chip for bioethanol production was developed and reported that enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> chip pretreated with GL is much more efficient than that pretreated with kraft cooking when compared at the same lignin content [5, 6]. Because lots of kraft pulp mills have recently been closed, it has become attractive to repurpose the mills into bioethanol plants [5, 6]. It is the special advantage in this repurposing that the mills already have equipments sufficient and proper as bioethanol plants [5, 6]. Moreover, an enzymatic hydrolysis subsequent to a GL pretreatment was reported to saccharify more efficiently and be freer from inhibitive substances than that subsequent to an acid pretreatment [5 – 8].|$|E
40|$|Background: Wood cell {{walls are}} rich in cellulose, {{hemicellulose}} and lignin. Hence, they are important sources of renewable biomass for producing energy and green chemicals. However, extracting desired constituents from wood efficiently poses significant challenges because these polymers are highly cross-linked in cell walls and are not easily accessible to enzymes and chemicals. Results: We show that aspen pectate lyase PL 1 - 27, which degrades homogalacturonan and is expressed {{at the onset of}} secondary wall formation, can increase the solubility of wood matrix polysaccharides. Overexpression of this enzyme in aspen increased solubility of not only pectins but also xylans and other hemicelluloses, indicating that homogalacturonan limits the solubility of major wood cell wall components. Enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> obtained from PL 1 - 27 -overexpressing trees gave higher yields of pentoses and hexoses than similar treatment of wood from wild-type trees, even after acid pretreatment. Conclusions: Thus, the modification of pectins may constitute an important biotechnological target for improved wood processing despite their low abundance in woody biomass...|$|E
30|$|Studies {{have found}} that a {{combination}} of another pretreatment process with biological pretreatment process is more effective as compared to a single pretreatment process. Wang et al. (2012) combined biological pretreatment with liquid hot water pretreatment method for better enzymatic saccharification of Populus tormentosa. This combination reported highest hemicellulose removal (92.33 %) resulting in 2.66 -fold increase in glucose yield as compared to pretreatment carried out with liquid hot water alone. Yu et al. (2009) studied the novel combination of either physical or chemical pretreatment with biological pretreatment on rice husk. Physical pretreatment was carried out using ultrasound while chemical pretreatment was carried out using H 2 O 2. Biological pretreatment was carried out using P. ostreatus. The combined pretreatment of rice husk carried out using 2 % H 2 O 2 for 48  h along with P. ostreatus was found more effective as compared to single step pretreatment using P. ostreatus for 60  days. Lignin removal was also found significantly higher as compared to one step treatment. Balan et al. (2008) studied and found that pretreatment of rice husk with P. ostreatus followed by AFEX pretreatment produced high glucan and xylan conversion as compared to a single pretreatment with AFEX. The combination of mild acid pretreatment (0.25 % H 2 SO 4) and biological pretreatment using Echinodontium.taxodii on water hyacinth was found more effective than one step pretreatment. The reducing sugars yield doubled as compared to single step acid pretreatment method (Ma et al. 2010). Sawada et al. (1995) combined steam explosion and pretreatment by P. chrysosporium for the enzymatic saccharification of plant wood. The <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> increased when treated with P. chrysosporium prior to steam explosion. Maximum production of reducing sugar was observed when wood was treated with P. chrysosporium for 28  days followed by steam explosion at 215  °C for 60 – 65  min.|$|E
30|$|Pulverized samples <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> cedar and {{eucalyptus}} {{were treated}} with 5  N NaOH solutions at 25 – 150  °C. Hemicellulose and lignin content in the samples decreased with increasing treatment temperatures, while the recovery of glucose was maintained at nearly 90  %. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that {{the content of the}} original cellulose I structure in the samples decreased with increasing temperature, and most of the cellulose in the sample treated at 150  °C was converted to cellulose II by mercerization. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the alkaline-treated samples was carried out at 37  °C using solutions comprising a mixture of cellulase and β-glucosidase. The samples treated at higher temperatures showed better enzymatic degradability. Treatment with an alkaline solution of lower concentration (1  N NaOH) at 150  °C was also used. Despite significant quantities of hemicellulose and lignin being removed, mercerization was not induced. The enzymatic degradability was much lower than that of the sample treated with a 5  N NaOH solution at 150  °C. Thus, treatment with concentrated alkaline solution at high temperature led to not only the removal of hemicellulose and lignin, but also to modification of the cellulose structure, which resulted in high efficiency <b>of</b> enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wood</b> samples.|$|R
30|$|Hiroi and Tamai [14] {{investigated}} the degradation and enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> rates <b>of</b> beech <b>wood</b> during maitake cultivation for 6  months without {{the development of}} fruit bodies. The rate <b>of</b> <b>saccharification,</b> lignin degradation and hemicellulose degradation in SMCM was lower (10, 30, and 40 %, respectively) than their observations. These differences are {{probably due to the}} difference in the contents of the media used by Hiroi and Tamai and the present study. Our medium was nutrient-rich with corn bran (about 25 %, based on wood dry weight) to obtain a high-quality fruit body. In addition, maitake prefers to consume glucans derived from corn bran rather than from wood during cultivation. By the time the fruit body was harvested, all the corn bran glucan was consumed by the maitake [16, 21]. As such, the effect of the maitake cultivation on beech wood in SMCM was less than that reported by Hiroi and Tamai. The consumption of corn bran renders the SMCM poor in nutrients, which possibly facilitates the maitake’s attack <b>of</b> the beech <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> SMCM during storage.|$|R

In addition, we have recently reported that ammonia pretreatment is also effective for improving the enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> hardwood biomasses such as birch wood with high xylan and low lignin contents [10]. The biomass recovery after ammonia pretreatment <b>of</b> birch <b>wood</b> meal was 99 % and this pretreatment did not change the neutral sugar and lignin contents, while the content of nitrogen increased {{and the content of}} acetyl group decreased after ammonia pretreatment, suggesting that the acetyl substitution of xylan was eliminated by the cleavage of ester linkages during ammonia pretreatment [10].|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{valorization}} {{of biomass}} for chemicals and fuels requires efficient pretreatment. One effectivestrategy involves the pretreatment with ionic liquids which enables enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> within a fewhours under mild conditions. This pretreatment strategy is, however, limited by {{water and the}} ionic liquids are ratherexpensive. The scarce understanding of the involved effects, however, challenges the design of alternative pretreatmentconcepts. This work investigates the multi length-scale effects of pretreatment of wood in 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazoliumacetate (EMIMAc) in mixtures with water using spectroscopy, X-ray and neutron scattering. Results: The structure of beech wood is disintegrated in EMIMAc/water mixtures with a water content up to 8. 6 wt%. Above 10. 7 wt%, the pretreated wood is not disintegrated, but still much better digested enzymatically compared tonative wood. In both regimes, component analysis of the solid after pretreatment shows an extraction of few percentof lignin and hemicellulose. In concentrated EMIMAc, xylan is extracted more efficiently and lignin is defunctionalized. Corresponding to the disintegration at macroscopic scale, SANS and XRD show isotropy {{and a loss of}} crystallinity inthe pretreated wood, but without distinct reflections of type II cellulose. Hence, the microfibril assembly is decrystallizedinto rather amorphous cellulose within the cell wall. Conclusions: The molecular and structural changes elucidate the processes of wood pretreatment in EMIMAc/watermixtures. In the aqueous regime with > 10. 7 wt% water in EMIMAc, xyloglucan and lignin moieties are extracted,which leads to coalescence of fibrillary cellulose structures. Dilute EMIMAc/water mixtures thus resemble establishedaqueous pretreatment concepts. In concentrated EMIMAc, the swelling due to decrystallinization of cellulose, dissolutionof cross-linking xylan, and defunctionalization of lignin releases the mechanical stress to result in macroscopicdisintegration of cells. The remaining cell wall constituents of lignin and hemicellulose, however, limit a recrystallizationof the solvated cellulose. These pretreatment mechanisms are beyond common pretreatment concepts and pavethe way for a formulation of mechanistic requirements of pretreatment with simpler pretreatment liquors.

In this study, enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) pre-treated Tetraselmis suecica biomass was carried out by using cellulase enzyme obtained from Trichoderma longibrachiatum. Initially, the pre-treatment conditions were optimised by changing alkali reagent concentration, retention time for reaction, and temperature. The T. suecica biomass after pre-treatment was also characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectra and Scanning Electron Microscope. These analyses revealed that the functional group such as acetyl and hydroxyl groups, structure and surface of T. suecica biomass were changed through pre-treatment, which is favourable for enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> process. Comparison <b>of</b> enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> untreated and pre-treated microalgal biomass indicated that higher level of reducing sugar can be obtained from pre-treated T. suecica. Enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> pre-treated T. suecica biomass was optimised by changing temperature, pH, and enzyme concentration to solid ratio ([E]/[S]). Highest conversion of carbohydrate into reducing sugar of 95 % amounted to reducing sugar yield of 20 (wt%) from pre-treated T. suecica was obtained from saccharification, at temperature: 40 °C, pH: 4. 5 and [E]/[S] of 0. 1 after 72 h of incubation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{conducted}} {{an investigation of}} the effect of lignosulfonate (LS) on enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> lignocelluloses. Two commercial LSs and one laboratory sulfonated kraft lignin were applied to Whatman paper, dilute acid and SPORL (sulfite pretreatment to overcome recalcitrance of lignocelluloses) pretreated aspen, and kraft alkaline and SPORL pretreated lodgepole pine. All three lignin samples inhibited cellulose <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> Whatman paper, but enhanced the <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> the four lignocellulosic substrates. The level of enhancement was related to the molecular weight and degree of sulfonation of the lignin as well as the substrate lignin structure. When different molecular weight (MW) fractions of one commercial LS (SXP), generated from sulfite pulping of hardwood, were applied to the Whatman paper, the large MW fraction (SXP 1) with the lowest degree of sulfonation inhibited cellulose saccharification while the intermediate (SXP 2) and smallest (SXP 3) MW fractions enhanced saccharification. All MW fractions enhanced <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> the four lignocellulosic substrates with maximal enhancement by the smallest MW fraction, SXP 3. The enhancement was most significant for the kraft lodgepole pine substrate and least significant for the SPORL pretreated lodgepole pine using all three LS and SXP fractions. The results suggest that LS acts as a surfactant to enhance pure cellullose saccharification.

30|$|When ethanol is {{produced}} from the SCMs, {{they need to}} be saccharified by enzymes or chemicals [5, 6]. It is known that the presence of lignin prohibits the enzyme from accessing polysaccharides during enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> lignocellulosic materials [7]. Many edible mushroom species, which are cultivated on wood meal-based media, belong to the white-rot fungi. White-rot fungi can degrade wood components such as lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose [8].

It was found that the best pretreatment strategy for M. pyrifera consisted of a pretreatment with 2 vol. % sulfuric acid, followed by <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> cellulose with a mixture of cellulases at pH 5. 2 for 4 h at 50 degrees C or by <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> alginate with the enzyme lyase/oligoalginate lyase at pH 7. 5 for 2 h at 37 degrees C. The process resulted in a release of 68. 4 wt. % of glucose (55. 74 +/- 0. 05 mg glucose/g algae) whereas in the case of alginate 85. 8 wt. % of uronic acid (193. 7 +/- 10. 6 mg uronic acid/g algae) was released. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first time that <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> both cellulose and alginate from brown algae is reported.

It was expected that the storage of SMCM would enhance the effect of sequential alkaline or vibrating ball milling treatment, because some lignin and hemicellulose would be removed from SMCM during storage (Table  1).|$|R

30|$|Various {{pretreatment}} {{methods are}} used to enhance the enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> lignocellulosic biomass [2]. Among them, {{one of the most}} promising approaches for lignocellulosic biomass from grass plants is pretreatment with liquefied ammonia, and this methodology has been extensively investigated [3 – 5]. The ammonia cleaves ester bonds in lignocellulosic biomass and generates amides [6, 7]. It has been demonstrated that ammonia pretreatment also alters the polymorphic form of crystalline cellulose with a low water content, transforming the natural crystalline form (cellulose I) to cellulose IIII [8], which is far more susceptible to enzymatic degradation [9]. Moreover, we have recently reported that ammonia pretreatment is effective for improving enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> not only grass biomasses but also hardwood biomasses with high xylan and low lignin contents such as birch wood and willow wood [10]. Nevertheless, searching for effective enzymes for the conversion of ammonia-treated hardwood biomass is still under development.|$|R
