Although {{he did not}} speak {{to her at the}} time, he later saw Julia again in Sefton Park, where he had gone with a friend to meet girls. Alf, who was dressed in a bowler hat and holding a cigarette holder, saw [...] "this little waif" [...] sitting on a wrought-iron bench. The 14-year-old Julia said that his hat looked [...] "silly", to which the 15-year-old replied that Julia looked [...] "lovely", and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> to her. Julia asked him to take off his hat, so he promptly took it off and threw it straight into the lake.|$|E

500|$|Alfred 'Freddie' Lennon—always called 'Alf' by his family—was always joking {{but never}} held {{a job for}} very long, preferring to visit Liverpool's many {{vaudeville}} theatres and cinemas, where he knew the usherettes by name. At the Trocadero club, a converted cinema on Camden Road, Liverpool, he first saw an [...] "auburn-haired girl with a bright smile and high cheekbones"; Julia Stanley. [...] He saw her again in Sefton Park, where he had gone with a friend to meet girls. Lennon, who {{was dressed in a}} bowler hat and with a cigarette holder in hand, saw [...] "this little waif" [...] sitting on a wrought-iron bench. Julia (14 years old) said that his hat looked [...] "silly", to which the 15-year-old Alf replied that she looked [...] "lovely", and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> to her.

6000|$|... "Hall right," [...] said Bird, {{and he took}} it away. He {{went out}} with a proud air, as if he felt honored by the trust Northwick had {{explicitly}} confirmed, and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> in the <b>next</b> room, so as to be within call.|$|R
500|$|She {{returned}} to the stage wearing a tank top with glittery tomboy looking suspenders and pants for a dance-oriented performance of [...] "Boys". The show continued with [...] "Stronger", in which she wore a paint-covered robe and in some shows a bowler hat. At {{the end of the}} performance, she <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> to a piano player and talked to the audience before moving into a performance of [...] "I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman". A video interlude spoofing Making the Band-type shows followed, showing Spears and her dancers as a struggling band. She took the stage again in a barge (wearing a black, silver, and gray rock star style jacket and green pants) along with four female dancers to perform [...] "I Love Rock 'n' Roll". The barge was lifted by wires, but pyrotechnics below it made it seem as if it was lifted by fire. When it was above the B-stage, Spears jumped to it with bungee cords. There was a skit in which her dancers chased her, before Spears loses the rock star jacket revealing a glittery red and purple halter top for a performance of [...] "What It's Like To Be Me" [...] in the small stage. She {{returned to}} the main stage for a performance of [...] "Lonely", in which she danced to a video projection of herself. The dancers and the band performed the [...] "Breakdown" [...] interlude. In [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know", she sang on an elevated platform wearing a white evening gown, while two of her dancers performed a routine. Artificial snow fell from the ceiling during the performance.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson fined Bryant an {{undisclosed}} amount for defying his orders to {{not talk to}} the press. O'Neal would reveal after the season that he promised Malone and Payton he would cease feuding with Bryant {{in light of his}} legal situation with the rape charge. [...] On opening night of the season, an injured Bryant <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> to O'Neal during the Lakers' victory over the Dallas Mavericks. [...] "We put it behind us", Bryant said. [...] "Shaq and I are going to move on, be teammates and help this team to a fourth title." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fifteen-year-old Eckford {{tried to}} enter the school, while {{soldiers}} of the National Guard, under orders from Arkansas Governor Faubus, stepped in her way to prevent her from entering. Eventually, she gave up and tried to flee to a bus stop through the mob of segregationists who surrounded and threatened to lynch her. Once Eckford got to the bus stop, she couldn't stop crying. A reporter, Benjamin Fine, having in mind his own 15-year-old daughter, <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> to Eckford. He tried to comfort her and told her, [...] "don't let them see you cry." [...] Soon, she was also protected by a white woman named Grace Lorch who escorted her onto a city bus.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Bucket, not unwelcome, has <b>sat</b> himself <b>down</b> <b>next</b> to Mr. George {{and taken}} Quebec and Malta on his knees. [...] "You pretty dears," [...] says Mr. Bucket, [...] "give us another kiss; it's {{the only thing}} I'm greedy in. Lord bless you, how healthy you look! And {{what may be the}} ages of these two, ma'am? I should put 'em down at the figures of about eight and ten." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was a loud}} buzz of conversation, and Philip listened attentively to {{that between}} four gentlemen who had just <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> at the <b>next</b> table to him. Three of them had come in together, and the fourth joined them, just as Philip's meal was brought to him.|$|R
60|$|His coldly even {{voice was}} in itself an aggravation, and Slavin, who {{saw one of}} the {{deputation}} move forward with a little glow in his eyes, rose sharply to his feet. He, however, <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>next</b> moment with a smile, for Sewell quietly laid his hand upon the man's arm, and the rest stood still in obedience to his gesture. Slavin was not astonished, for he, too, was a man who understood how to wield authority.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the hour}} {{preceding}} the attack, 13 people including the shooter {{participated in the}} Bible study. [...] According to the accounts of people who talked to survivors, when the shooter walked into the historic African-American church, he immediately asked for Pinckney and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> to him, initially listening to others during the study. He started to disagree when they began discussing Scripture. Eventually, after waiting for the other participants to begin praying, {{he stood up and}} pulled a gun from a fanny pack, aiming it at 87-year-old Susie Jackson. Jackson's nephew, 26-year-old Tywanza Sanders, tried to talk him down and asked him why he was attacking churchgoers. The shooter responded, [...] "I have to do it. You rape our women and you're taking over our country. And you have to go." [...] When he expressed his intention to shoot everyone, Sanders dove in front of Jackson and was shot first. The suspect then shot the other victims, all the while shouting racial epithets. He also reportedly said, [...] "Y'all want something to pray about? I'll give you something to pray about." [...] He reloaded his gun five times. Sanders' mother and his five-year-old niece, both attending the study, survived the shooting by pretending to be dead.|$|E
60|$|He {{seemed to}} find a {{momentary}} relief in the dramatic effect of his announcement. He came near to a swagger of despair upon the hearthrug, and then suddenly came and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> to Ann and rested his chin on the knuckles of his two clenched hands.|$|E
60|$|Howard <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> to his mother, {{and facing}} the wife, {{who had a}} small, fretful child in her arms. At Howard's left was the old man, Lewis. The supper was spread upon a gay-colored oilcloth, and {{consisted}} of a pan of milk, set in the midst, with bowls at each plate. Beside the pan was a dipper and a large plate of bread, and {{at one end of}} the table was a dish of fine honey.|$|E
60|$|The Barclays <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> at the <b>next</b> table; and called, in {{a foreign}} accent, for two glasses of beer. Then they spoke together, for some little time, about a journey from Saint Malo which they had just made; and Ralph then turned to Colonel Tempe, still {{speaking}} French with a strong foreign accent.|$|R
60|$|He {{dropped the}} {{curtains}} over the broad window and regal moon. He shut out sovereign and court and starry armies; he added {{fuel to the}} hot but fast-wasting fire; he lit a candle, of which there were a pair on the table; he placed another chair opposite that near the workstand; and then he <b>sat</b> <b>down.</b> His <b>next</b> movement was to take from his pocket a small, thick book of blank paper, to produce a pencil, and to begin to write in a cramp, compact hand. Come near, by all means, reader. Do not be shy. Stoop over his shoulder fearlessly, and read as he scribbles.|$|R
6000|$|And {{then the}} jury {{retired from the}} court to {{consider}} their verdict, and Mr. Gitemthruet predicted {{that they would be}} hungry enough before they <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to their <b>next</b> meal. 'His lordship was dead against us,' said Mr. Gitemthruet; 'but that was a matter of course; we must look to the jury, and the city juries are very fond of Mr. Chaffanbrass; I am not quite sure, however, that Mr. Chaffanbrass was right: I would not have admitted so much myself; but then no one knows a city jury so well as Mr. Chaffanbrass.' ...|$|R
60|$|She {{showed him}} rapidly {{how to set}} about the business. Philip was {{impressed}} by her earnestness, but repelled by her want of charm. He {{was grateful for the}} hints she gave him and set to work again. Meanwhile other people had come in, mostly men, for the women always arrived first, and the studio for the time of year (it was early yet) was fairly full. Presently there came in a young man with thin, black hair, an enormous nose, and a face so long that it reminded you of a horse. He <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> to Philip and nodded across him to Miss Price.|$|E
60|$|The Vicar {{felt that}} the heavens had fallen. He sat {{crumpled}} up in his chair, a shattered man. Lady Hammergallow <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> to him without appearing to see him. She was breathing heavily, but her face was terribly calm. Everyone sat down. Was the Angel grossly ignorant or only grossly impertinent? The Angel was vaguely aware of some frightful offence, aware that in some mysterious way he had ceased to be {{the centre of the}} gathering. He saw reproachful despair in the Vicar's eye. He drifted slowly towards the window in the recess {{and sat down on the}} little octagonal Moorish stool by the side of Mrs Jehoram. And under the circumstances he appreciated at more than its proper value Mrs Jehoram's kindly smile. He put down the violin in the window seat.|$|E
6000|$|By and by I was favoured {{with a fine}} {{exhibition}} of the spirit animating these two little things. The weather had {{made it possible for}} the crowd of visitors to go down and scatter itself over the beach, when the usual black cloud sprang up and soon burst on us in a furious tempest of wind and rain, sending the people flying back to the shelter of a large structure erected for such purposes against the cliff. It was a vast barn-like place, open to the front, the roof supported by wooden columns, and here in a few minutes some three or four hundred persons were gathered, mostly women and their girls, white and blue-eyed with long wet golden hair hanging down their backs. Finding a vacant place on the bench, I <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> to a large motherly-looking woman with a robust or dumpy blue-eyed girl about four or five years old on her lap. Most of the people were standing about in groups waiting for the storm to blow over, and presently I noticed my two wild-haired dark little girls moving about in the crowd. It was impossible not to seen them, for they could not keep still a moment. They were here, there, and everywhere, playing hide-and-seek and skipping and racing wherever they could find an opening, and by and by, taking hold of each other, they started dancing. It was a pretty spectacle, but most interesting to see was the effect produced on the other children, the hundred girls, big and little, the little ones especially, who had been standing there tired and impatient to get out to the sea, and who were now becoming more and more excited as they gazed, until, like children when listening to lively music, they began moving feet and hands and soon their whole bodies in time to the swift movements of the little dancers. At last, plucking up courage, first one, then another, joined them, and were caught as they came and whirled round and round in a manner quite new to them and which they appeared to find very delightful. By and by I observed that the little rosy-faced dumpy girl on my neighbour's knees was taking the infection; she was staring, her blue eyes opened to their widest in wonder and delight. Then suddenly she began pleading, [...] "Oh, mummy, do {{let me go to the}} little girls--oh, do let me!" [...] And her mother said [...] "No," [...] because she was so little, and could never fly round like that, and so would fall and hurt herself and cry. But she pleaded still, and was ready to cry if refused, until the good anxious mother was compelled to release her; and down she slipped, and after standing still with her little arms and closed hands held up as if to collect herself before plunging into the new tremendous adventure, she rushed out towards the dancers. One of them saw her coming, and instantly quitting the child she was waltzing with flew to meet her, and catching her round the middle began spinning her about as if the solid little thing weighed no more than a feather. But it proved too much for her; very soon she came down and broke into a loud cry, which brought her mother instantly to her, and she was picked up and taken back to the seat and held to the broad bosom and soothed with caresses and tender words until the sobs began to subside. Then, even before the tears were dry, her eyes were once more gazing at the tireless little dancers, taking on child after child as they came timidly forward to have a share in the fun, and once more she began to plead with her [...] "mummy," [...] and would not be denied, for she was a most determined little Saxon, until getting her way she rushed out for a second trial. Again the little dancer saw her coming and flew to her like a bird to its mate, and clasping her laughed her merry musical little laugh. It was her [...] "sudden glory," [...] an expression of pure delight in her power to infuse her own fire and boundless gaiety of soul into all these little blue-eyed rosy phlegmatic lumps of humanity.|$|E
6000|$|Outside of {{the cave}} by the faint starlight they saw the little shape of Nya {{creeping}} down the mound, and thence across the open space towards the wall, and went after her, thinking that she intended to pass the wall. But this she did not do, for {{when she came to}} its foot Nya, notwithstanding her feebleness, began to climb the rough stones as actively as any cat, and though their ascent seemed perilous enough, reached the crest of the wall sixty feet above in safety, and there <b>sat</b> herself <b>down.</b> <b>Next</b> they heard her beating upon the drum she bore, single strokes always, but some of them slow, and some rapid, with a pause between every five or ten strokes, [...] "as though she were spelling out words," [...] thought Rachel.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{the gentleman}} who had been so kind to her, <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> in the <b>next</b> seat to Geoffrey, and began to whisper to him, {{as he did so}} glancing once or twice towards the grating behind which she was. She guessed that he was telling him the story of the lady who was so unaccountably anxious to hear the debate, and how pretty she was. But it did not seem to {{interest}} Geoffrey much, and Beatrice was feminine enough to notice it, and to be glad of it. In her gentle jealousy, she did not like to think of Geoffrey as being interested in accounts of mysterious ladies, however pretty.|$|R
60|$|He {{came and}} <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>next</b> to me, and my {{attention}} wandered. The q-b was raging for her dinner. It must be quite half-past eight. The kid, the perfect kid would be cold and ruined. Both fire and candle were burning low. Someone {{had been out}} for a new candle, but there was evidently no means of replenishing the fire. The mate still crouched on the hearth, the dull red fire-glow on his handsome face, patiently trying to roast the kid and poking it against the embers. He had heavy, strong limbs in his khaki clothes, but his hand that held the spit was brown and tender and sensitive, a real Mediterranean hand. The girovago, blond, round-faced, mature and aggressive with all his liveliness, {{was more like a}} northerner. In the background were four or five other men, of whom I had distinguished none but a stout soldier, probably chief carabiniere.|$|R

6000|$|... 'But, in {{this one}} glimpse of the {{beautiful}} face, my uncle saw that the young lady cast an imploring look upon him, and that she appeared terrified and distressed. He noticed, too, that the young fellow in the powdered wig, notwithstanding his show of gallantry, which was all very fine and grand, clasped her tight by the wrist when she got in, and followed himself immediately afterwards. An uncommonly ill-looking fellow, in a close brown wig, and a plum-coloured suit, wearing a very large sword, and boots up to his hips, belonged to the party; and when he <b>sat</b> himself <b>down</b> <b>next</b> to the young lady, who shrank into a corner at his approach, my uncle was confirmed in his original impression that something dark and mysterious was going forward, or, as he always said himself, that [...] "there was a screw loose somewhere." [...] It's quite surprising how quickly he {{made up his mind}} to help the lady at any peril, if she needed any help.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Horn and {{his party}} <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{together}} the <b>next</b> morning on the plateau to drink their hot coffee and eat their biscuit and bacon, and it was plain that the two ladies, {{as well as the}} captain, had had little sleep the night before. Ralph declared that he had been awake ever so long, endeavoring to calculate how many cubic feet of gold there would be in that mound if it were filled with the precious metal. [...] "But as I did not know how much a cubic foot of gold is worth," [...] said he, [...] "and as we might find, after all, that there is only a layer of gold on top, and that all the rest is Incas' bones, I gave it up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{with this}} person not being at home, and that person being {{expected}} home in the afternoon, and so forth, the inquiry took me three days. On {{the evening of the}} third day, coming over Waterloo Bridge from the Surrey side of the river, quite beat, and very much vexed and disappointed, I thought I'd have a shilling's worth of entertainment at the Lyceum Theatre to freshen myself up. So I went into the Pit, at half-price, and I <b>sat</b> myself <b>down</b> <b>next</b> to a very quiet, modest sort of young man. Seeing I was a stranger (which I thought it just as well to appear to be) he told me the names of the actors on the stage, and we got into conversation. When the play was over, we came out together, and I said, [...] "We've been very companionable and agreeable, and perhaps you wouldn't object to a drain?" [...] "Well, you're very good," [...] says he; [...] "I SHOULDN'T object to a drain." [...] Accordingly, we went to a public- house, near the Theatre, <b>sat</b> ourselves <b>down</b> in a quiet room up- stairs on the first floor, and called for a pint of half-and-half, apiece, and a pipe.|$|R

50|$|The Tibetan legend {{said that}} a revered high lama, Atisha, was walking alone when he found a man {{starving}} and near death. After looking around and unable to find food for the old man, he cut flesh from his own body and offered it to the starving man. But the man refused to eat the his flesh. Being depressed and not knowing how else to help the man nearing death, Lama Atisha <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> to him.

60|$|He {{went back}} to his seat and lighted his pipe again. He had learned that Telford was a {{stranger}} and had apparently thought it advisable to account for his visiting the town. Foster saw that he ought to have guessed the fellow was not a resident when he asked for his mail, because had he been in business in the city he would have had his private box at the post office. Moreover he imagined that the clerk knew he really wanted to find out something about Telford, and thought him clumsy, but this did not matter. He had been told he had an ingenuous look, which was rather an advantage, since it suited the part he meant to play. He did not want people to think him clever, but they must not suspect that he was pretending to be dull. Remembering his mistakes, he smiled as he admitted that there was not much danger of this. By and by Telford came in and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> in the <b>next</b> chair.|$|R
