5|$|Axis forces {{employed}} {{biological and}} chemical weapons. The Imperial Japanese Army {{used a variety of}} <b>such</b> <b>weapons</b> during its invasion and occupation of China (see Unit 731) and in early conflicts against the Soviets. Both the Germans and Japanese tested <b>such</b> <b>weapons</b> against civilians and, sometimes on prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland did {{not possess}} {{biological}} weapons nor chemical weapons, {{nor did they}} see it as in their interest to acquire them. Thus the banning of <b>such</b> <b>weapons</b> was in the country's interest. Switzerland signed the Biological Weapons Convention in April 1972 and ratified the treaty in 1976 with three reservations. The country also signed the Chemical Weapons Convention in January 1993 and ratified it in March 1995.|$|E
5|$|In May 1943 Albert Speer, the Reich's Minister of Armaments and War Production, {{informed}} Adolf Hitler of {{work that}} was being carried out to produce a supergun capable of firing hundreds of shells an hour over long distances. The newly designed gun, codenamed the Hochdruckpumpe ("High Pressure Pump", HDP for short) and later designated as the V-3, {{was one of the}} V-weapons– Vergeltungswaffen ("retaliation weapons")– developed by Nazi Germany in the later stages of the war to attack Allied targets. Long-range guns were not a new development, but the high-pressure detonations used to fire shells from previous <b>such</b> <b>weapons,</b> including the Paris gun, rapidly wore out their barrels.|$|E
5000|$|Despite [...] provocations by China since 2010s, President Benigno Simeon Aquino III {{disagreed}} on {{letting the}} Philippines have nuclear weapons. He justified {{it from the}} lack of government funds to create <b>such</b> <b>weapon,</b> coupled with the fact that having <b>such</b> <b>weapon</b> would only escalate tensions between the two countries.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to finding weaponry {{out in the}} wastelands, the player can also create their own. To craft <b>such</b> <b>weapons,</b> the player must use a workbench, possess either the necessary schematics or the right Perk, and scavenge for the items needed to make them. These weapons usually possess significant advantages over other weapons of their type. Each weapon's schematic has three copies that can be found, and possessing additional copies improves the condition (or number) of items produced at the workbench, while a higher repair skill {{will result in a}} better starting condition for the related weapon. Weapon schematics can be found lying in certain locations, bought from vendors, or received as quest rewards.|$|E
5|$|In response, ETOUSA {{initiated}} Operation Peppermint. Special {{equipment was}} prepared. Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which {{were used to}} measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by air with the highest priority. Chemical Warfare Service teams were trained in its use, and Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance. The equipment was held in readiness, but the preparations were not needed, because the Germans had not developed <b>such</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|E
5|$|It was {{considered}} {{more likely that}} Germany might employ <b>such</b> <b>weapons</b> against the United Kingdom, so four officers from the European Theater of Operations United States Army (ETOUSA) were summoned to Chicago where {{they were given a}} top secret briefing by the Manhattan District's Chicago area engineer, Major Arthur V. Peterson. They were told about possible forms such an attack might take, and what the effects and symptoms of them were, and they were given survey instruments and shown how to use them. They were enjoined to tell other officers in the theater to report unexplained fogging of film or illnesses with symptoms corresponding to the effects of radiation sickness.|$|E

60|$|It was {{considered}} {{that the evidence}} given was sufficient to make a remand imperative, and Phineas Finn was committed to Newgate. He was assured that every attention should be paid to his comfort, and was treated with great consideration. Lord Cantrip, who still believed in him, discussed the subject both with the magistrate and with Major Mackintosh. Of course the strictest search would be made for a second life-preserver, or any <b>such</b> <b>weapon</b> as might have been used. Search had already been made, and no <b>such</b> <b>weapon</b> had been as yet found. Emilius had never been seen with any <b>such</b> <b>weapon.</b> No one about Curzon Street or Mayfair could be found who had seen {{the man with the}} quick step and raised collar, who doubtless had been the murderer, except Lord Fawn,--so that no evidence was forthcoming tending to show that Phineas Finn could not have been that man. The evidence adduced to prove that Mr. Emilius,--or Mealyus, as he was henceforth called,--could not have been on the spot was so very strong, that the magistrate told the constables that that man must be released on the next examination unless something could be adduced against him.|$|R
6000|$|His {{animation}} fell; {{the slight}} gesture {{of his hand}} expressed discouragement; {{but he added that}} he had asked one of the sergeants to show him the new rifle. There was no <b>such</b> <b>weapon</b> in his fighting days; and if Barrios could not-- ...|$|R
5|$|The flame fougasse has {{remained}} in army field manuals as a battlefield expedient {{to the present}} day. <b>Such</b> <b>weapons</b> are improvised from available fuel containers combined with standard explosive charges or hand grenades and are triggered electrically or by lengths of detonating cord. In some designs, detonating cord is used to rupture the container immediately before triggering the propelling charge. In order to guarantee ignition, the improvised devices frequently feature two explosive charges, one to throw {{and the other to}} ignite the fuel. Weapons of this sort were widely used in the Korean and Vietnam Wars as well as other conflicts.|$|E
5|$|The three leading clans of Quraysh at {{that time}} were Banu Hashim, Banu Abd ad-Dar and Banu Makhzum, the latter clan being {{responsible}} for the matters of warfare. As {{a member of the}} Makhzum clan, who were amongst the best horsemen in Arabia, Khalid learned to ride and use <b>such</b> <b>weapons</b> as the spear, the lance, the bow and the sword. The lance was said to be his favorite among the weapons. In youth he was admired as a renowned warrior and wrestler among the Quraysh. Khalid was a cousin of Umar, the future second Caliph, and they looked very similar.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, {{a section}} funded by MI6 {{was created for}} propaganda, headed by Sir Campbell Stuart. It was {{allocated}} premises at Electra House and was dubbed Department EH. On 25 September 1939 the unit was mobilised to Woburn Abbey where it joined a subversion team from MI6, known as Section D, and by July these teams {{became a part of}} the newly created Special Operations Executive (SOE). These SOE elements went on to form the core of the Political Warfare Executive in 1941. Their task was to spread false rumours and conduct psychological warfare. Inspired by a demonstration of petroleum warfare, one false rumour stated that the British had a new bomb: dropped from an aircraft, it caused a thin film of volatile liquid to spread over {{the surface of the water}} which it then ignited. Such rumours were credible and rapidly spread. American broadcaster William Shirer recorded large numbers of burns victims in Berlin; though it is not clear what he personally saw, it seems likely his reports were influenced by rumours. The interrogation of a Luftwaffe pilot revealed the existence of <b>such</b> <b>weapons</b> was common knowledge, and documents found after the war showed the German high command were deceived. The rumour seemed to take on a life of its own on both sides leading to persistent stories of a thwarted German invasion, in spite of official British denials. On 15 December 1940, The New York Times ran a story claiming that tens of thousands of German troops had been 'consumed by fire' in two failed invasion attempts.|$|E
6000|$|... "An arquebus, {{shoot him}} with an arquebus!" [...] shouted the men in front; {{but there was no}} <b>such</b> <b>weapon</b> in the boat, for the Spaniards, who had left in a hurry, and without expecting to meet Red Martin, had nothing but their swords and knives.|$|R
25|$|As the United States Army Chemical Corps focused {{its efforts}} on the weaponization of sarin nerve agent (GB) during the 1950s the M34 cluster bomb was the first <b>such</b> <b>weapon</b> mass-produced by the Army. The weapon was the United States' first major nerve agent weapon after World War II.|$|R
50|$|Helicopters {{have carried}} {{anti-tank}} guided missiles (ATGM) tipped with HEAT warheads since 1956. The first {{example of this}} {{was the use of}} the Nord SS.11 ATGM on the Aérospatiale Alouette II helicopter by the French Armed Forces. After then, <b>such</b> <b>weapon</b> systems were widely adopted by other nations.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the war, the {{composition}} of the infantry division gradually changed, and there was an increased emphasis on providing the infantry divisions with organic fire support. By 1918, a British division consisted of three infantry brigades, each of three battalions. Each of these battalions had 36 Lewis machine guns, making a total of 324 <b>such</b> <b>weapons</b> in the division. Additionally, there was a divisional machine gun battalion, equipped with 64 Vickers machine guns in four companies of 16 guns. Each brigade in the division also had a mortar battery with eight Stokes Mortars. The artillery also changed the composition of its batteries. At the start of the war, there were three batteries with six guns per brigade; they then moved to four batteries with four guns per brigade, and finally in 1917, to four batteries with six guns per brigade to economise on battery commanders. In this way, the army would change drastically over {{the course of}} the war, reacting to the various developments, from the mobile war fought in the opening weeks to the static trench warfare of 1916 and 1917. The cavalry of the BEF represented 9.28% of the army; by July 1918, it would only represent 1.65%. The infantry would decrease from 64.64% in 1914 to 51.25% of the army in 1918, while the Royal Engineers would increase from 5.91% to 11.24% in 1918.|$|E

5000|$|In Canada, brass knuckles, also {{referred}} to as [...] "brass monkeys", or any similar devices, are listed as prohibited weapons; possession of <b>such</b> <b>weapon</b> is a criminal offence under the Criminal Code. Plastic knuckles have been determined to be legal in Canada. Similar legislation has been instituted in Russia and Australia.|$|R
50|$|The asbaran cavalry {{were armed}} {{with a variety of}} weapons. The {{traditional}} heavy cavalry <b>weapons,</b> <b>such</b> as maces, lances, and swords would have been used, as well as a variety of other <b>weapons,</b> <b>such</b> as axes. Asbaran cavalry were not, however restricted to short-range weapons, as they often carried <b>weapons</b> <b>such</b> as darts and bows.|$|R

25|$|Twenty-five countries, {{including}} the United Kingdom, the United States, Sweden and Russia produce man-portable air defense systems. Possession, export, and trafficking in <b>such</b> <b>weapons</b> is officially tightly controlled, {{due to the}} threat they pose to civil aviation, although such efforts {{have not always been}} successful.|$|E
5000|$|Although the Soviet {{scientific}} community discussed {{the possibility of}} an atomic bomb throughout 1930s, going as far as to making a concrete proposal to develop <b>such</b> <b>weapon</b> in 1940, the full-scale program was initiated only in response to the intelligence reports collected by Soviet intelligence through their spy ring in the United States on the secretive Manhattan Project.|$|R

25|$|What is more, if <b>such</b> <b>weapons</b> were {{developed}} by both superpowers, {{they would be more}} effective against the U.S. than against the USSR, as the U.S. had far more regions of dense industrial and civilian activity as targets for large weapons than the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|NFA {{weapons are}} weapons that are heavily {{restricted}} at a federal level by the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986. These include automatic firearms (such as machine guns), short-barreled shotguns, and short-barreled rifles. Some {{states and localities}} place additional restrictions on <b>such</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|E
25|$|Opdycke's counterattack {{was joined}} by reserve {{elements}} of Reilly's division (the 12th Kentucky Infantry and 16th Kentucky Infantry) and survivors of Strickland's and Wagner's divisions. Together they sealed the breach.
