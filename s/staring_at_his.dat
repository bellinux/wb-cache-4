25|$|There were no titles for Gaudio in 2003, {{but he was}} {{involved}} in two controversies, the first of them involved compatriot Guillermo Coria in the Hamburg Masters. They were part of an all-Argentine semifinal lineup, the others being David Nalbandian and Agustín Calleri. Gaudio and Coria played in one semifinal, and Coria won the first set and Gaudio the second. Coria took an injury timeout for cramps. After the timeout, Coria, after breaking serve at the change of ends beat his left breast while <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> opponent, which Gaudio took as an insult. Coria proceeded to win the last set 6–0, and there was allegedly a confrontation after the match in the locker room.|$|E
500|$|When {{he finally}} decided to abandon Fountain City, Chabon recalls <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> blank {{computer}} for hours, before suddenly picturing [...] "a 'straitlaced, troubled {{young man with a}} tendency toward melodrama' trying to end it all." [...] He began writing, and within a couple of days, had written 50 pages of what would become his second novel, Wonder Boys. Chabon drew on his experiences with Fountain City for the character of Grady Tripp, a frustrated novelist who has spent years working on an immense fourth novel. The author wrote Wonder Boys in a dizzy seven-month streak, without telling his agent or publisher he'd abandoned Fountain City. The book, published in 1995, was a commercial and critical success.|$|E
500|$|According to Nowalk, {{the idea}} to have Lexie wear a diaper {{to get through the}} {{operation}} was inspired by an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show. He added: [...] "It wasn't that big of a leap for us to go diaper. Our doctors are hardcore by nature." [...] Nowalk said that this episode was primarily focused around Shepherd, which he considered an [...] "experiment". He commented that the idea of Isaac's storyline came from Dr. Robert Bray, a neurosurgeon in Los Angeles. Nowalk intended the nature of the episode to be [...] "different", attributing it to the fact that Heigl's character was absent. He also praised Wilson for directing the episode, commenting that [...] "she acts, she sings, and now she directs". The majority of the episode involved Shepherd <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> patient's tumor, contemplating what to do. Nowalk offered his insight on this: ...|$|E

2500|$|Henri Pélissier was {{the first}} French winner of the Tour de France since 1911, and ended a series of seven Belgian victories. Desgrange, {{who had been in}} a fight with Pélissier for three years, wrote [...] "The {{mountains}} seemed to sink lower, sunk by the victorious thrust of his muscle. More than a score of times on the most vicious gradients, hands on the tops of the bars, {{he looked down at the}} valley bottoms, like an eagle <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> prey". The French victory was good for the organising newspaper l'Auto: the circulation increased to almost half a million copies, while it peaked at one million the morning after Pélissier's victory.|$|E
