40|$|This article {{draws upon}} two {{different}} ethnographic studies – one based in Sweden, {{the other in}} the United Kingdom – to explore how private <b>security</b> <b>officers</b> working in an ambiguous and stigmatized industry construct and repair their self-esteem. While the concept of ‘dirty work’ (Hughes 1951) has been applied to public police officers, an examination of private <b>security</b> <b>officers</b> as dirty workers remains undeveloped. Along with describing instances of taint designation and management, we find that the occupational culture of <b>security</b> <b>officers</b> enhances self-esteem by infusing security work with a sense of purpose. As members of a tainted occupation, <b>security</b> <b>officers</b> employ a range of strategies to deflect scorn and reframe their work as important and necessary...|$|R

Saxton's mother signed over guardianship of her son to Scientology when he was 16 years old. Saxton was assigned to become a <b>security</b> <b>officer</b> for the organisation. According to Saxton staff in Scientology were not given sufficient drugs or medical attention, and so he removed his own teeth without usage of medication for pain.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{fieldwork}} among operational <b>security</b> <b>officers</b> {{working in}} the Hamburg and Rotterdam ports, it became clear these frontline port policing professionals possess a critical, even fearful attitude towards coercion while performing their duties in the ports. The power of arrest {{and the possibility of}} being weaponised were especially problematic. Overall, they revealed a rather different attitude towards coercion than is generally ascribed to <b>security</b> <b>officers</b> and accounted for in (critical) criminological literature. This paper will explore the extent to which (the stereotype of) <b>security</b> <b>officers</b> being power hungry and trigger-happy cowboys is a correct reflection of port security occupational realities in Northwest Europe. Empirical evidence is provided on security officers’ worry and fear of using power, weaponisation, and accountability. It will show that the <b>security</b> <b>officers,</b> responsibilised for making port communities feel safer and the port as highly important global critical infrastructure more secure, are fearful and risk-averse themselves. Meaning that, if <b>security</b> <b>officers</b> fear to coerce (with weapons) due to accountability fear, which turns them idle, it implies we are witnessing the delivery of a placebo security that deserves further scrutiny...|$|R

Herbert Skinner suggested to Pontecorvo that he apply for a newly created professorship at the University of Liverpool, where Skinner held the Lyon Jones chair of experimental physics. In June 1950, Pontecorvo was offered the position.|$|E

5|$|The prison officer's {{role in the}} 20th century did {{not change}} much, with the job still entailing a boredom-inducing daily routine focused on <b>security.</b> <b>Officer</b> {{training}} became a priority under Campbell's administration, from the late 1960s.
