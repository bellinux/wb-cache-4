50|$|Direct {{hydrogen}} cooling {{is employed}} in the stator terminals. The rotor forging is of nickel chromium molybdenum vanadium steel having a minimum yield point of 33.2 ton/in.2. The <b>shaft</b> <b>end</b> which connects to the turbine is deferentially tempered to give additional strength to withstand the severe forces which could be applied under fault conditions on the generator. The first three critical speeds are arranged to be below the running speed. The hydrogen-cooled rotor conductors are formed from silver-bearing hard drawn copper tube. Two tubes in parallel form one conductor and there are six conductors per slot except for the slots adjacent to the pole centres, which contain five. The generator is ventilated by cold gas fed {{to a number of}} radial ducts at the slipring end of the core, which communicate with the axial vent holes in the core and stator teeth. After passing through the axial holes the gas is discharged into the ‘air’ gap through further radial ducts at the turbine end of the core. The gas discharged from the core passes along the ‘air’ gap, together with the hot gas discharged from the outlet holes in the rotor body, to the region between the end windings and a baffle at the slipring end, and thence through one half of each axial cooler to the blower intake. After leaving the blower, the gas is passed through the other halves of the coolers and is delivered to the various inlet regions of the stator core and rotor. Gas is fed to the turbine end of the rotor through axial holes machined in the hub of the blower rotor from an annulus formed between the end bracket and the blower outlet diffuser. Large diameter tubes passing longitudinally through the stator frame connect this annulus to the extreme end section at the slipring end, from which the slipring end of the rotor is fed. The three-stage axial blower mounted on the generator shaft comprises a shaft-mounted sleeve upon which is mounted the bladed rotor disc, a bladed stator casing, a diffuser and an inlet fairing.|$|E

However, the subject of stresses on the pedestal bolts and casing is a critical area that must also be analyzed. An in-depth study was made on the deformation and stress analysis of centerline mounted end suction pumps, whose stiffness were relatively low and were frequently required to withstand rather high nozzle loads. The nozzle load analysis consisted of deformation and stress measurements, combined with finite element calculation. The analysis resulted in a versatile empirical formula for end suction, centerline mounted pumps {{that can be used to}} estimate the <b>shaft</b> <b>end</b> displacement, pedestal bolt stress and casing stress for arbitrary nozzle loads.

These externally imposed variable loads come from sources like compressor surge, misalignment between turbine shaft, and the driven machine, to name a few. These loads can be bending or torsional in nature. To assure reliability, the design method should include the influence of such loads on the final sizing of the <b>shaft</b> <b>end.</b> The design method should also include the effects of shrink fits, keyways, fillets, chrome plating and fretting on the fatigue properties of the shaft material.

40|$|LecturePg. 77 - 90 Clearances between sealing {{devices of}} {{rotating}} and stationary components of turbomachinery {{have always been}} important to engineers in controlling gas leakages. One way of accomplishing this is {{by the use of}} abradable seals which reduces clearances and limits the risk of damage to the rotating/stationary member if a rub occurs. The program presented evaluates various candidate abradable materials through performance in a test rig and the development of the final process parameters. The results of the tests indicated that for centrifugal compressor applications, the mica filled tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), silicone rubber, aluminum polyester and nickel graphite are all acceptable materials for abradable seals. Temperature limits were specified for each of these materials. For steam turbines, nickel chromium and nickel graphite are suitable and, again, temperature limits were specified. Application of abradable seals to centrifugal compressors has shown efficiency improvements of up to 0. 5 percent per stage for high flow machines, and up to 2. 5 percent per stage for low flow machines. Performance improvements in excess of two percent have been calculated for noncondensing steam turbines utilizing abradable materials in <b>shaft</b> <b>end</b> packing, blade tip and stage diaphragm seals...|$|E
40|$|Fluid-induced {{instability}} of a rotor-bearing system occurs frequently in rotating machinery. This involves {{two types of}} instability, i. e., fluid whirl and whip. Whirl is a predominately rigid-body mode and tracks at around one-half shaft running speed. Its threshold speed can be arbitrarily raised by using externally-pressurized fluid bearings, which allow for adjustable pressure for high stiffness. Whip is mainly a rotor-bending mode and locks into the rotor natural frequency. It appears when increases in bearing stiffness no longer influence the instability threshold. As demonstrated both analytically and experimentally in this paper, however, use of an externally-pressurized gas seal in the mid-span of the rotor can successfully eliminate whip. Its threshold speed can be greatly raised beyond running speed by adding the mid-span seal, to nearby the antinode of the rotor-bending mode. An experimental rig was operated at speed up to 10, 000 rpm, far above the rotor natural frequency of less than 2000 rpm without the seal. Gas supply pressure could be adjusted to yield stiffness required for eliminating whip, which would otherwise appear even with an externally pressurized fluid bearing at the <b>shaft</b> <b>end.</b> This approach encourages utilization of existing process gas as the supporting medium to eliminate fluid-induced instability...|$|E
40|$|The {{destabilizing}} {{influence of}} the internal friction on the supercritical rotor whirl can be efficiently counterbalanced by other external dissipative sources and/or anisotropic suspension systems. The theoretical approach may take the internal dissipation into consideration either by dry or viscous models. Nevertheless, several numerical results and a new perturbation technique of the averaging type prove that similar rotor motions and stability limits are achievable by both models, whence the linear viscous assumption appears preferable. Thus, the internal hysteretic force may be expressed by {{the product of an}} equivalent viscous coefficient and the rotor centre velocity relative to a reference frame rotating with the <b>shaft</b> <b>end</b> sections. After calculating the natural frequencies and the response to dynamic imbalances, the stability of the steady motion is checked by the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, focusing the analysis on the individual influence of several characteristic properties, like the gyro structure, the stiffness anisotropy of the supports and their asymmetry, and searching for the external damping level needed for stability. A fairly interesting result is that the benefit of the suspension anisotropy is most effective for a symmetric rotor mounted at the shaft mid-span and decreases significantly on increasing the configuration asymmetry, even moderately. It is also observed how the stability may somehow be associated with the coupling between progressive and retrograde recession motions...|$|E
