500|$|Kinsler, {{who already}} had 30 stolen bases, hit his 30th home run on September 25, {{becoming}} the only major leaguer to join the 30–30 club in 2009, and the 34th major leaguer ever. He became only the second player in Rangers' history to have a 30–30 season (joining Alfonso Soriano, who did it in 2005), and joined Soriano (who also had 30–30 seasons in 2002 and 2003 for the Yankees) and Brandon Phillips (2007) as the only 30–30 second basemen in Major League history. [...] "It's an incredible accomplishment", <b>said</b> <b>Michael</b> Young. [...] "I've played with guys who have had some incredible seasons here, but 30–30 is something special. He deserves a lot of credit. He battled all season long. That's what separates the great players from the good ones." ...|$|E
500|$|The process {{used by the}} {{character}} Watney to produce water was accurate and is being used by NASA for a planned Martian rover. The radioisotope thermoelectric generator was also appropriately used for heat. When his rations begin to run low, Watney builds an improvised garden using Martian soil and the crew's feces as a fertilizer. [...] "We could probably grow something on Mars", <b>said</b> <b>Michael</b> Shara, curator, Department of Astrophysics, Division of Physical Sciences at the American Museum of Natural History. It is also believed that microbial organisms {{have the potential to}} live on Mars. In one scene, the glass face shield on Watney's helmet cracks; as oxygen momentarily drops below the critical level, he quickly patches the helmet with duct tape and avoids suffocation. According to Shara, [...] "As long as the pressure on the inside is around 30 percent, you could hold it together before your eyes blow out or you had an embolism." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall, {{television}} {{writer for}} The Star-Ledger, <b>said</b> <b>Michael</b> acted so [...] "nakedly selfish and unfeeling" [...] {{that it made}} the episode unpleasant to watch: [...] "If last week's 'Blood Drive' gave us Michael at his most human and sympathetic, then 'Golden Ticket' showed how a human Michael {{could also be a}} monster." [...] However, Sepinwall said he did think the subplot involving Kevin receiving romantic advice was funny and sweet: [...] "Brian Baumgartner's just been aces the last two weeks, and if it hadn't been for this story, I might have found 'Golden Ticket' unbearable." [...] Dan Hopper of VH1's Best Week Ever strongly criticized the episode and the behavior of the characters: [...] "Why was every single character on last night’s Willy Wonka episode acting like a complete idiot? Not 'idiot' {{in the sense that the}} characters are always dumb and goofy in an amusing way, but 'idiot' as in 'none of these human beings would ever act this way and this is really frustrating to watch? ...|$|E

500|$|As the {{controversy}} unfolded, the Wikipedia community began {{a review of}} Essjay's previous edits and some felt he had relied upon his fictional professorship to influence editorial consideration of edits he made. [...] "People have gone through his edits and found places where he was basically cashing in on his fake credentials to bolster his arguments", <b>said</b> <b>Michael</b> Snow, a Wikipedia administrator {{and founder of the}} Wikipedia community newspaper, the Signpost. [...] "Those will get looked at again." [...] For instance, Essjay had recommended sources such as Catholicism for Dummies, a book granted the nihil obstat and imprimatur by the Roman Catholic Church. Essjay defended his use of the book by telling fellow Wikipedia editors in a disagreement over the editing of the article Imprimatur: [...] "This is a text I often require for my students, and I would hang my own Ph.D. on it's [...] credibility." [...] In another case (a discussion of the liturgical use of the psalms), he cited personal experience from [...] "the Abbey of Gethsemani, where I was a monk." ...|$|E
500|$|Brian Howard of The Journal News {{said the}} episode flowed well {{and he liked}} the payoff at the end when Pam joined Michael's new paper company, {{but he said the}} moments with Michael {{crawling}} on the floor felt like [...] "unnecessary padding". Nevertheless, he said, [...] "I’m looking forward to rewatching this episode, probably the first time I’ve done that since '.'" [...] Andy Shaw of TV Fodder <b>said</b> <b>Michael</b> was much more likable in [...] "Two Weeks" [...] than in other recent episodes, and said, [...] "Steve Carell was at his best, with great throwaway lines and getting to the heart of Michael's love for Dunder-Mifflin and paper." [...] Will Leitch of New York magazine said the episode marked a [...] "major step" [...] for the series and had some particularly sweet moments between Michael and Pam. He also particularly liked the moment when Charles Miner, who is played by the same actor who played drug dealer Stringer Bell on the HBO series The Wire, threatened to attack Michael: [...] "Michael Scott being beaten up by Stringer Bell. That's one for the TV annals." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to time constraints, a team {{of writers}} was {{assigned}} to write the teleplay. In addition to the story credit to Ganino and Stillwell, Moore, Ira Steven Behr, Hans Beimler and Richard Manning would work on the teleplay, and Piller would provide the finishing touches. Because the Writers Guild would not allow more than three staff writers {{to appear in the}} credits (four after a special waiver was granted), Piller agreed to not feature his name in the credits. A partial first draft was submitted on November 30 so that preproduction for the episode could commence. The altered timeline provided a chance to show the Enterprise crew in a much more dramatic and human light than would be allowable in a normal episode. Behr explained that since the original timeline was to be restored, the writers had the freedom to include more action. [...] "Even though it was an alternate universe, [...] and I got all excited because we realized we were going to kill everyone on screen", he <b>said.</b> <b>Michael</b> Okuda and Rick Sternbach submitted technical memos regarding the type of anomaly that might drag the Enterprise-C through time, and suggested interstellar, super-dense strings as a possibility. The first draft teleplay was completed by December 4, and a preproduction meeting was held the same day. Given the scale of the story, various departments argued over costs and what items could be cut to reduce the budget. The final draft was finished and submitted on December 8.|$|E

Winton told him Michael believes Natasha needs {{to deal with}} her own mistakes herself as she is eighteen. He <b>said</b> <b>Michael's</b> choice was valid, but was unsure if it was the right one. On whether the storyline would explore why Natasha has been acting out so much, Winton said [...] "I think the storyline will and does explore that. If you look at the fact she has a single father who is raising her and she's a woman at the age where she is wanting to discover herself, it is a tough time. I think not having a good cop, bad cop or not having a mother around to help with the disciplining in order to look after her as a woman coming into the world, it's got to be a fairly tough thing." [...] Natasha and Michael eventually make amends, but it is not an easy journey and they have a lot to work through. Bower later teased a storyline which shows the beginning of Natasha wanting {{to find out more about}} her late mother. Bower told Kilkelly that the secret would be revealed in three parts, which would change Natasha and Michael's lives forever." ...|$|R
