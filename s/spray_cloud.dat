40|$|A {{program for}} {{simulating}} ice accretion on an offshore structure due to spray generation from wave-structure impacts {{is presented in}} this paper. The program is an upgraded version of RIGICE that was first developed in 1987 and incorporates a number of improvements, specifically: a more accurate expression for the equilibrium freezing point of seawater, an empirical expression for sponginess of marine ice {{as a function of}} air temperature, a spray liquid water content versus height model that is matched with field data, and a new algorithm for estimating the frequency of significant spray events that generate <b>spray</b> <b>clouds</b> above 10 m high. Comparisons of ice accretion predictions are presented between the current version, RIGICE 04 and a previous version, N_RIGICE. Generally, RIGICE 04 predicts lower total ice accretion mass than N_RIGICE. RIGICE 04 results are also compared with measured ice accretion duration on an offshore rig operating on the East coast of Canada. The current prediction is in good agreement with the measured duration; while the N_RIGICE prediction was more than twice the measured duration.

They could hear the soft splash and tinkle of water rippling among the stones, but now and then this sound was drowned as the roar of the reef grew louder and deeper. Presently a dim, filmy whiteness in front of them resolved itself into a glimmering <b>spray</b> <b>cloud</b> and fountains of spouting foam, and when at length they stopped among a cluster of wet boulders they could see a black ridge of rock thrusting itself out, half buried, into a mad turmoil of frothing water.

40|$|Mosquito control aerial adulticiding sprays rely on {{the drift}} of aerosol spray clouds with drop sizes less than 50 microns in diameter. These sprays {{by their very nature}} will drift for a long distance. In order to {{minimize}} biologically significant off-target drift, careful planning derived from a good understanding of all aspects influencing <b>spray</b> <b>cloud</b> dispersal is essential. Three phases of vertical <b>spray</b> <b>cloud</b> dispersal occur between emission at the aircraft nozzle and depositing out at ground level: entrainment within the descending aircraft vortices, general atmospheric turbulence and sedimentation. These three phases of movement are influenced by four major factors (assuming aircraft type, speed and weight are constant) : Droplet size, Spray altitude, horizontal wind speed and atmospheric stability. For the small drop sizes effective against adult mosquitoes, sedimentation velocity is very small and so sedimentation plays a minimal role in their vertical transport from aircraft to ground level. But it may be important in regards to the larger droplet fraction produced by inefficient “conventional ” spray systems which produce a <b>spray</b> <b>cloud</b> with a VMD between 50 and 100 microns.

Tests include varying cloud LWC (0. 5 to 5 au gm), cloud median volume diameter (MVD) (15 to 26 microns), temperature (- 29 to 20 C), and air speeds (50 to 285 mph). Comparisons were based upon evaluating probe estimates of cloud LWC and median volume diameter for given tunnel settings. Variations of plus or minus 10 % and plus or minus 5 % in LWC and MVD, respectively, were determined of <b>spray</b> <b>clouds</b> between test made at given tunnel settings (fixed LWC, MVD, and air speed) indicating cloud conditions were highly reproducible. Although LWC measurements from JW and Leigh devices were consistent with tunnel values, individual probe measurements either consistently over or underestimated tunnel values by factors ranging from about 0. 2 to 2. Range amounted to a factor of 6 differences between LWC estimates of probes for given cloud conditions. For given cloud conditions, estimates of cloud MVD between probes were within plus or minus 3 microns and 93 % of the test cases. Measurements overestimated tunnel values in the range between 10 to 20 microns. The need for improving currently used calibration procedures was indicated.

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{description}} of the interacting multiscale processes governing spray vaporization and combustion downstream from the near-injector atomization region in liquid-fueled burners. One of the main objectives is to emphasize the progress made in the mathematical description and understanding of reactive spray flows by incorporation of rationally derived simplifications based on the disparity of length and time scales present in the problem. In particular, we aim to show how the disparity of the scales that correspond – with increasing values of their orders of magnitude – to the droplet size, interdroplet spacing, and width of the spray jets, ensures the validity of their homogenized description. The two-way coupling associated with exchanges of mass, momentum, and energy between the gas and the liquid phases is dominated by the homogenized exchanges with the gas provided collectively by the droplets, and not by the direct interaction between neighboring droplets. The formulation is used as a basis to address nonpremixed spray diffusion flames in the Burke-Schumann limit of infinitely fast chemical reactions, with the conservation equations written in terms of chemistry-free coupling functions that allow for general nonunity Lewis numbers of the fuel vapor. Laminar canonical problems that have been used in the past to shed light on different aspects of spray-combustion phenomena are also discussed, including spherical <b>spray</b> <b>clouds</b> and structures of counterflow spray flames in mixing layers.

For solution of a set of problems which is connected with ecology, theory of combustion and explosion, engine design, fire safety, etc. the knowledge of spray combustion behaviour is required. To investigate the influence of a variety in density and transport coefficients and flame front structure, combustion of pure gas cloud is studied numerically. Combustion of a small-scale spherical pocket of fuel droplets in a calm environment may be considered as a model enabling the transient combustion process to be studied conveniently in one-dimensional geometry. Apart from pure academic interest, such a study provides useful estimations of burning <b>spray</b> <b>cloud</b> characteristics which can be applied for the analysis of more complicated situations. An analytical approach is used to find quasi-steady state distributions of gas temperature and fuel mass fraction for both pure evaporating and burning clouds.

Numerical method is used to solve the problem of <b>spray</b> <b>cloud</b> combustion using more common unsteady statement. Two types of ignition are used at the centre or from penphery of cloud.
