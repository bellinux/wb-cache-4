25|$|The Atlantic {{noted that}} Daenerys and Queen Cersei share the {{parallels}} of being forced into marriage, having powerful strengths of will, and being utterly ruthless toward their enemies. As bloodline and succession are the quickest and <b>surest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> assert strength in Westeros, Cersei {{takes advantage of}} motherhood by procreating with her brother Jaime and having children fathered by her hated husband Robert aborted, thereby leaving him without a true heir in revenge. Martin said that Cersei's walk of public penitence in A Dance with Dragons may be read as misogynistic or feminist. Jane Shore, mistress of King Edward IV, was punished similarly after Edward's death. Cersei is defined by her pride, and this punishment was directed at women to break their pride, but was never inflicted on men.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 18th century, Guria faced an {{increasing}} {{political and economic}} downfall due to the Ottoman encroachments as well as repeated occasions of civil strife. Attempts by the Gurian princes to enter into alliances with other Georgian rulers and Russia resulted {{in a series of}} Turkish punitive raids. By 1723, the Gurieli had lost Batumi and Chakvi to the Ottomans and the whole coastline of Guria had been garrisoned by the Turks. The Gurian support to the Russians during the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774) caused a severe reaction from the Ottoman government. Kobuleti and the surrounding area were detached from Guria and subjected to Islamization, an apostasy being the <b>surest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> escape slavery. The rest of Christian population had to move to safer regions of Georgia. This, combined with extensive slave trade and Turkish inroads, resulted in a virtual depopulation of several areas of Guria towards the late 18th century. The population of Guria was estimated by Güldenstädt at 5,000, and by Reineggs at 6,000 families in the 1770s.|$|E

There are very few differences between the authenticated version and the replica version. The <b>surest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> identify one version from the other is to check the engraving for the 1984 Stanley Cup winning Edmonton Oilers.

Traffickers can be [...] "caught" [...] at any one of the three steps of trafficking: recruitment, movement, and/or exploitation; anti-trafficking laws as well as child labour laws must then be appropriately enforced and having them properly implemented. The development of grassroots surveillance systems has also been suggested by UNICEF which would enable communities to immediately report signs of child trafficking to legal authorities.|$|E

[...] She has said that giving IVF fertility treatment to lesbians would [...] "help destroy our understanding of human identity", and expressed her opinion that opposition to it represents [...] "a fightback to save our civilisation". She said the UK government was brainwashing children by including references to gay people in lessons about censuses and population movement. Philips called it [...] "an abuse of childhood", part of a [...] "ruthless campaign by the gay rights lobby to destroy the very concept of normal sexual behaviour". She received the 'Bigot of the Year' award from gay equality organisation Stonewall in 2011.|$|E

2500|$|Keble countered against {{rebellion}} against an apostatised state: [...] "On the same principle, come what may, we have ill learned {{the lessons of}} our Church, if we permit our patriotism to decay, together with the protecting care of the State. “The powers that be are ordained of God,” whether they foster the true church or no. Submission and order are still duties. They were so {{in the days of}} pagan persecution; and the more of loyal and affectionate feeling we endeavour to mingle with our obedience, the better". Instead, [...] "the <b>surest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> uphold or restore our endangered Church, will be for each [...] of her anxious children, in his own place and station, to resign himself more thoroughly [...] to his God and Saviour in those duties, public and private, which are not immediately [...] affected by the emergencies of the moment: the daily and hourly duties, I mean, of piety, purity, charity, justice".|$|E

In 1930, Tahar Haddad, himself influenced by the reformist current begun in the Nineteenth Century by Kheirredine Pasha, Ibn Ahmad ibn Abi Diyaf, Muhammad Snoussi, Salem Bouhageb, Mohamed Bayram V and other thinkers who all defended the concept of modernism, published [...] "Our Women in Sharia and Society."
