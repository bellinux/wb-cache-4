40|$|A {{modified}} circumferential <b>segmented</b> <b>ring</b> seal {{was designed}} for direct replacement of a helicopter transmission elastomeric lip seal operating on a shaft diameter of 13. 91 centimeters (5. 481 in.) at sliding velocities to 52. 48 m/sec (10 330 ft/min). The modifications involved the garter spring tension, shaft roundness, seal housing flatness, and pumping grooves to inhibit leakage. Operation of the seals in bench tests under simulated helicopter transmission conditions revealed that the seal leakage rate was within acceptable limits and that the wear rate was negligible. The low leakage and wear rates were confirmed in flight tests of 600 and 175 hours (sliding speed, 48. 11 m/sec (9470 ft/min)). An additional 200 hours of air worthiness qualification testing (aircraft tie down) demonstrated that the seal can operate at the advanced sliding conditions of 52. 48 m/sec (10 330 ft/min) ...|$|E

The simulation results indicate that segment floating will reduce by shortening slurry’s initial solidification time, slowing shielding speed, improving the tunnel longitudinal stiffness as well as increasing the frictional force between <b>segment</b> <b>rings.</b> And some measures are given such as applying new rapid-setting slurries, shear pins, rubber mats with high friction coefficient and pre-stressed bolts...|$|R

40|$|The D-Zero Central Calorimeter Module Assembly is a <b>segmented</b> <b>ring</b> {{structure}} {{consisting of}} {{an assemblage of}} trapezoidal modules. It is housed inside a vessel containing liquid argon. The modules contain specialized equipment for use in particle physics experiments. The design review of the D-Zero Central Calorimeter Module Assembly evaluated all major structural elements for adequacy for their design loads. They were evaluated in accordance with applicable specifications from Reference 1. The allowable stresses of the Specifications provide an approximate safety factor of 2. 0 or more on failure and 1. 67 on serviceability of the structure. This margin is typical of buildings, bridges, and other large structures executed in steel. To the extent that calculated stresses are less than the allowable stresses, the margin is proportionately greater. For additional conservatism to account for inherent uncertainties in estimating design loads, an arbitrary load factor of 1. 25 was also applied. Design loads were calculated for deadwe 1 ghted plus thermal expansion, neglecting the effects of friction, and for deadweight only, considering postulated effects of friction. All of the major structural elements {{were found to be}} provisionally acceptable for their intended service and the predicted design loads. The provisions are as follows: (1) That the connect pins be fabricated of Inconel 718 or functional equivalent, instead of the originally specified Type 304 stainless steel; and (2) That conditions on bearing surfaces be modified to effectively reduce the potential coefficient of friction. The affected bearing interfaces include those between the CH, FH, and EM rings, and between the CH ring and its support members.

ABSTRACT: In this study, isovolumic bronchial <b>segments</b> and bronchial <b>rings</b> {{were used to}} investigate the influence of airway diameter on smooth muscle force generation and acetylcholine responsiveness. Segments with internal diameters ranging from 1. 0 – 6. 0 mm {{were obtained from the}} mainstem bronchus of eight pigs. Responses to increasing acetylcholine con-centrations were quantified in segments by intralumenal pressure (cmH 2 O), and in rings by tension (g·cm- 1). The negative log of the concentration producing half the maximal effect (EC 50) (i. e. pD 2) to acetylcholine was calculated for each <b>segment</b> and <b>ring.</b> Ring tension was used to calculate a theoretical lumen pressure for each ring, and this, along with the pD 2, was compared with values obtained from seg-ments of the same diameter. Intermediate-sized segments produced significantly greater intralumenal pres-sures than did large or small segments. Small segments were 160 times more sen-sitive to acetylcholine than large segments. In contrast to the <b>segments,</b> bronchial <b>rings</b> showed no effect of size on acetylcholine sensitivity. Theoretical ring lumen pressures matched those measured for large and intermediate segments, but not for small segments.

40|$|An {{ion trap}} source has been {{designed}} for use with time-of-flight (TOF) mass analysis. Two thin diaphragms make up a <b>segmented</b> <b>ring</b> electrode; the end cap electrodes are planar wire mesh. The potential field produced by the rf voltage applied between the ring and end cap electrodes resembles that of the cylindrical ion trap. The trapped ion population for ions created by electron impact exhibits linear growth against a first-order loss that has a time constant of about 50 μs; no ion loss occurs when the electron beam is off. The observed value of qz. gif"> at low-mass cutoff for rf ion storage is − 0. 84. Pulsed extraction of all ions is accomplished by switching the trap electrodes from rf to voltages required to provide a linear dc extraction field. The TOF flight path includes a wide energy range reflectron. Better than unit mass resolution is achieved through m/z 500 without collisional ion cooling. With an extraction rate of 1 kHz and a recording rate of 4 spectra per second, a linear working curve is obtained between 36 pg and 18 ng of chlorobenzene delivered chromatographically.

In {{order to provide}} better {{information}} on veneer production and utilization, in this {{study the effects of}} wood juvenility and veneer thickness on lathe checks of jabon rotary-cut veneer were evaluated. Before veneer manufacturing, the jabon log was boiled at 50 and 75 °C for 4 and 8 hours respectively. The boiled logs were peeled to produce veneer of 1 and 2 mm thick. Lathe checks of veneers were measured under an optical video microscope. The rotary-cut veneer was grouped and evaluated separately at every <b>segmented</b> <b>ring</b> of 1 cm from pith to bark.

A magnetic field is aligned with the longitudinal axis of the vacuum chamber. The magnetic field is time invariant and uniform in strength over the containment region. An electric field is also aligned with the longitudinal axis of the vacuum chamber and the magnetic field. The electric field is time invariant, and forms a potential well over the containment region. One or more means are disposed around the cloud of particles for inducing a rotating electric field internal to the vacuum chamber.

In {{order to provide}} better {{information}} on veneer production and utilization, in this {{study the effects of}} wood juvenility and veneer thickness on lathe checks of rotary-cut sengon veneers were evaluated. Before veneer manufacturing, sengon logs were boiled at 50 oC and 75 oC for 4 and 8 hours respectively. The boiled logs were peeled to produce veneer of 1 mm, 1. 5 mm, 2 mm in thickness. Lathe checks of veneers were measured on the loosed side at every 5 mm veneer length under an optical video microscope and their frequency, depth, and length were characterized. Twenty sampling points of 5 mm veneer length were prepared from each <b>segmented</b> <b>ring</b> of 1 cm width from pith to bark. Isocyanate resin adhesive were used to produce laminated veneer lumber (LVL) of 20 mm thick, which consisted of 24 -ply of 1 mm veneer thick, 14 -ply of 1. 5 mm veneer thick, and 11 -ply of 2 mm veneer thick, for glue bond and bending strength test. Results showed that wood juvenility and veneer thickness determined the frequency, depth and length of lathe checks for the sengon rotary-cut veneers. In general, the frequency of lathe checks of the veneer increases with increasing veneer thickness, and also increases from pith to bark. Boiling of logs before rotary-cutting could decreases the frequency of lathe check of the veneer. The results indicated that boiling of logs at 50 oC for 8 h and at 75 oC at least 4 h before peeling the logs could minimize the frequency of lathe check in manufacturing rotary cut veneer thickness of 1 mm, 1. 5 mm, and 2 mm from juvenile wood of fast growing sengon. The frequency of lathe check affect significantly the glue bond and bending strength, in which the glue bond, Modulus of Elasticity (MOE), and Modulus of Rupture (MOR) decrease as the frequency of lathe checks increases.

40|$|The image {{intensity}} in high-angle annular dark field STEM images shows a strong chemical sensitivity. As {{it is also}} influenced by specimen thickness, crystal orientation as well as characteristics of illumination and detector, a standard-free quantification of composition requires a comparison with accurate image simulation, for which we use the frozen lattice approach of the STEMsim program taking the non-uniform detector sensitivity into account. The experimental STEM intensity is normalized {{with respect to the}} incident electron beam. For the quantification of a STEM image it is subdivided into Voronoi cells in which the intensity is averaged. Analysis of the composition in a ternary semiconductor layer such as InxGa 1 -xN requires measuring the specimen thickness in regions with known composition by comparison with the simulated STEM intensity. Interpolation of the obtained thickness into the layer with unknown composition yields a map of the specimen thickness. Finally, specimen thickness and STEM intensity are compared with simulations computed as a function of composition resulting in a map of the In-concentration x. In alloys containing atoms with different covalent radii (e. g. In and Ga in InxGa 1 -xN) static atomic displacements occur, which are computed with empirical potentials and included in the simulation. As an application example Fig. 1 a shows an array of core-shell nanowires. One single nanowire is depicted in Fig. 1 b. The core-shell area marked by a yellow frame is shown in Fig. 1 c. Figs. 1 d and 1 f show high-resolution STEM images of the core-shell regions corresponding to the top and the bottom of a nanowire, respectively. The maps of the measured In-concentration given in Figs. 1 e and 1 g reveal an increasing thickness of the layer along the growth direction. In the upper part, the layer shows variations of the In-concentration clearly beyond the random-array fluctuations as was shown by a comparison with image simulation. In {{the second part of the}} talk we present results on measurements of atomic electric fields. Differential phase contrast STEM detects the field-induced angular deflection of the electron beam with a <b>segmented</b> <b>ring</b> detector (J. Chapman et al., Ultramicroscopy 3 (1978), 203) assuming that the Ronchigram is homogeneously filled and shifted as a whole in the presence of electromagnetic fields (N. Shibata et al., Nat. Phys. 8 (2012), 611). These assumptions were tested by simulation for 1. 3 nm thick GaN. Fig. 2 b shows Ronchigrams simulated for 6 x 6 scan positions within the region marked in Fig. 2 a. The dominant effect of the atomic electric field is a complex redistribution of intensity within a Ronchigram. By fundamental quantum mechanical arguments, we take the complex intensity distribution in the Ronchigram into account (K. Müller et al., Nat. Commun. 5 (2014), 5653). The {{intensity in}} a certain pixel of the recorded Ronchigram is proportional to the probability that the corresponding momentum is observed. Thus, a center-of-gravity type summation yields the expectation value for the momentum. To relate the electric field in the specimen to the observed momentum transfer, Ehrenfest's theorem is applied. For thin specimens, the expectation value of the momentum is found to be proportional to the projection of the electric field along the optical axis, convolved with the intensity distribution of the incident STEM probe. We demonstrate the potential of this approach in both simulation and experiment. For the GaN simulation in Fig. 2 c we find the electric field depicted in Fig. 2 d. Atomic sites appear as sources of the field which has a magnitude of up to 1. 5 V/pm. As only the convolution of the true field with the probe intensity can be measured, the field strength decreases in the direct vicinity of atomic sites. In a first experiment, 20 x 20 Ronchigrams of SrTiO 3 with a thickness of 2. 5 nm have been recorded on a conventional charge-coupled device (CCD), yielding the electric field in Fig. 2 e. We also report on pilot experiments with the ultrafast pnCCD camera (K. Müller et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 101 (2012), 212110) which was operated at read-out rates of up to 4 kHz. For example, Fig. 2 f shows the momentum transfers recorded at a MoS 2 mono/bilayer interface, demonstrating that fast detectors are the key for atomic-scale materials analyses at a reasonable field of view...|$|E
