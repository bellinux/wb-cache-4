5|$|Although Warren {{departed}} soon afterwards leaving just a frigate squadron behind, {{the siege}} continued throughout August. French forces dominated Elba but {{were unable to}} make an impression {{on the walls of}} the fortress while Royal Navy forces controlled access to the island by sea, providing <b>supplies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> defenders and denying them to the French. Halsted and Phoenix maintained a blockade of the port of Piombino on the Italian mainland, ensuring the interception of French supplies.|$|E

5|$|Intent {{on making}} more money, Forbes in November 1922 began selling {{valuable}} hospital supplies under his control in large warehouses at the Perryville Depot in Maryland. The government had stockpiled huge quantities of hospital supplies {{during the first}} World War, which Forbes unloaded {{for a fraction of}} their cost to the Boston firm of Thompson and Kelly {{at a time when the}} Veterans' Bureau was buying <b>supplies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> hospitals at a much higher price.|$|E
5|$|Like her {{brothers}} and sisters, Hańska was educated {{by her parents}} about family lineage and religion. Her mother was a devout Catholic, but her father also taught the children about Voltairian rationality. The family was secluded in Pohrebyszcze, with only occasional trips away. Once a year, the family visited Kiev for a market gathering, during which Rzewuski sold grain and her mother purchased clothing and <b>supplies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> estate.|$|E
5|$|Once forces began {{assembling}} at Oswegatchie, Lorimier {{made arrangements}} with a sympathetic priest near The Cedars for the provisioning of <b>supplies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> troops.

5|$|Six {{months after}} an {{extraterrestrial}} invasion, history professor Tom Mason is made second-in-command of the 2nd Mass, {{a group of}} soldiers and civilians. Weaver, 2nd Mass' commanding officer, sends Tom, Hal and {{a small group of}} soldiers on a mission for <b>supplies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of the troop. While on the mission, Hal catches a glimpse of his missing brother Ben, who has been enslaved by the aliens.|$|E
5|$|The final {{source of}} supply was Allied air drops. This {{was the only way}} to obtain more exotic, highly useful {{equipment}} such as plastic explosives and antitank weapons such as the British PIAT. During the war, 485 air-drop missions from the West (about half of them flown by Polish airmen) delivered some 600 tons of <b>supplies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Polish resistance. Besides equipment, the planes also parachuted in highly qualified instructors (Silent Unseen), 316 of whom were inserted into Poland during the war.|$|E
5|$|The next {{recorded}} {{activity of}} El Sol was on 3 August, {{when she was}} transferred from the Army to the U.S. Navy and commissioned the same day with Lieutenant Commander G.

5|$|With Caen {{north of}} the River Orne in Allied hands, mine-clearance {{operations}} were launched, bulldozers were set to work to clear the streets and a convoy of trucks carrying <b>supplies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> civilian population was brought in. On 10 July, the French flag was raised over the city and three days later a parade {{was held in the}} Place Saint-Martin during which a second flag was raised to the strains of Scottish bagpipers playing La Marseillaise.|$|E
5|$|As the Anzac Mounted Division {{approached}} Um Zughla at 02:00 on 21 December, a halt {{was called}} until 03:30 when the column continued on to El Arish. At 07:45, the advanced troops entered the town, unopposed, {{to contact the}} civil population and arrange water <b>supplies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mounted force. One prisoner was captured, while lines of observation were set up, which maintained a close watch over the country east {{and south of the}} town. By 16:00 the 1st and 3rd Light Horse, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and the Imperial Camel Brigades were in bivouac at El Arish, the only casualties during the day being two members of the 1st Light Horse Brigade, who were blown up by a stranded mine on the beach.|$|E
5|$|As the Seven Years' War entered its {{later stages}} through 1758 and 1759, French forces and colonies in northeastern North America came under renewed attacks from British armies. In 1758 after defeat in July at the Battle of Carillon, the British took Louisbourg in August, causing Atlantic Canada {{to fall into}} British hands, and opening the sea route to attack Quebec. Fort Frontenac fell to the British in the same month, costing the French <b>supplies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Ohio Valley campaign. When some of the Indian {{supporters}} of the French made peace with the British, France was forced to draw its troops back. French leadership, specifically Governor de Vaudreuil and General Montcalm, were unsettled by the British successes. However, Quebec {{was still able to}} protect itself as the British prepared a three-pronged attack for 1759.|$|E

5|$|Following their {{transfer}} to the Army, the Chinooks were used in similar roles to those they had undertaken in RAAF service. The first operational deployment of the Army Chinooks began in October 1997, when two of the helicopters and three Black Hawks which were in Papua New Guinea {{as part of a}} training exercise were tasked with delivering food supplies to the highlands of the country following a severe drought. The Chinooks were also used to transport fuel <b>supplies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other ADF aircraft and helicopters involved in this effort. At this time, the deployment of two Chinooks was the largest the Army could undertake as the other helicopters were undergoing maintenance or were needed for training purposes. The Chinooks returned to Australia in March 1998.|$|E
5|$|From the 1830s onward, Mobile {{expanded}} into {{a city of}} commerce with a primary focus on the cotton and slave trades. Many slaves were transported by ship in the coastwise slave trade from the Upper South. There were many businesses in the city related to the slave trade – people to make clothes, food, and <b>supplies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> slave traders and their wards. The city's booming businesses attracted merchants from the North; by 1850 10% of its population was from New York City, which was {{deeply involved in the}} cotton industry. Mobile was the slave-trading center of the state until the 1850s, when it was surpassed by Montgomery.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated {{with the}} legal hassles that went with land speculation, in 1788, Boone moved upriver to Point Pleasant, Virginia (now West Virginia). There he {{operated}} a trading post and occasionally worked as a surveyor's assistant. When Virginia created Kanawha County in 1789, Boone was appointed lieutenant colonel of the county militia. In 1791, {{he was elected to}} the Virginia legislature for the third time. He contracted to provide <b>supplies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Kanawha militia, but his debts prevented him from buying goods on credit, so he closed his store and returned to hunting and trapping.|$|E

5|$|Hindman set to {{work and}} issued a series of harsh {{military}} edicts, instituting conscription, authorizing guerrilla warfare and requisitioning <b>supplies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> defense of the State. Hindman also commenced a campaign of misinformation designed to mislead Federal authorities about {{the strength of the}} state's defenses. He also diverted Texas troops bound for Virginia for use in defense of Arkansas. This series of events, combined with harassing tactics, confused the Federal authorities, causing them to fear {{that they did not have}} an adequate supply line to conquer the state and soon diverted from a course towards the capital and instead moved to Helena to reestablish a solid supply line.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to volunteers, Jefferson also {{arranged for a}} regiment of 200 regular Continental soldiers under Colonel John Gibson to accompany Clark. Longstanding tensions between Continental Army officers and the militia made such cooperation problematic, however. Colonel Daniel Brodhead, the Continental Army commander at Fort Pitt, refused to detach men for Clark's campaign because he was staging his own expedition against the Delaware Indians, who had recently entered {{the war against the}} Americans. Brodhead marched into the Ohio Country and destroyed the Delaware Indian capital of Coshocton in April 1781. This resulted in the Delaware becoming more determined enemies, and deprived Clark of badly needed men and <b>supplies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Detroit campaign.|$|E
5|$|In late 1775, Benjamin Church, the Director General, {{assigned}} McKnight to the Putnam House building, {{one of six}} hospitals of the army's Hospital Department in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He {{remained in}} that division, which supported Washington's army, until, {{during a period of}} great scarcity of medical and surgical <b>supplies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sick and wounded, McKnight went with other surgeons and physicians to North Castle, New York with Washington's army when the Battle of White Plains began in October 1776. The Continental Army lost the battle, and the British took Fort Washington and Fort Lee, which pushed Washington's ragged army south toward New Jersey in December 1776, which {{set the stage for the}} Battle of Trenton.|$|E
