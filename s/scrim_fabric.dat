40|$|A lightweight, battery {{construction}} {{for lead}} acid batteries in which biplates are formed from a continuous strip of thermoplastic material, one face of the strip being provided with a plurality of electrically isolated lead strip arrays, each having a transverse axis about which the strip is folded or pleated to provide pleated biplate walls. The pleated continuous strip is sealed along edge longitudinal portions to provide chambers for receiving a plurality of non-conductive thermoplastic separator-plates and to contain electrolyte liquid. Separator-plates support resilient yieldable porous glass mats and <b>scrim</b> <b>fabric</b> in which active material is carried. The assembly of pleated biplates and separator-plates is maintained in pressure relation by exterior resilient means. A method of making such a continuous pleated biplate construction and of assembling one or more battery modules which may be connected in series or in parallel. A biplate construction having continuously wound lead stripes attached to a substrate...|$|E
40|$|High {{temperature}} structural resins {{are required}} for use on advanced aerospace vehicles as adhesives and composite matrices. NASA-Langley developed polyimide resins were evaluated as high temperature structural adhesives for {{metal to metal bonding}} and as composite matrices. Adhesive tapes were prepared on glass <b>scrim</b> <b>fabric</b> from solutions of polyamide acids of the semicrystalline polyimide LARC-CPI, developed at the NASA-Langley Research Center. Using 6 Al- 4 V titanium adherends, high lap shear bond strengths were obtained at ambient temperature (45. 2 MPa, 6550 psi) and acceptable strengths were obtained at elevated temperature (14. 0 MPa, 2030 psi) using the Pasa-Jell 107 conversion coating on the titanium and a bonding pressure of 1. 38 MPa (200 psi). Average zero degree composite tensile and compressive strengths of 1290 MPa (187 ksi) and 883 MPa (128 ksi) respectively were obtained at ambient temperature with unsized AS- 4 carbon fiber reinforcement...|$|E
40|$|A {{composite}} flexible blanket insulation (CFBI) system {{considered for}} use as a thermal protection system for space vehicles is described. This flexible composite insulation system consists of an outer layer of silicon carbide fabric, followed by alumina mat insulation, and alternating layers of aluminized polyimide film and aluminoborosilicate <b>scrim</b> <b>fabric.</b> A potential application of this composite insulation would be as a thermal protection system for the aerobrake of the aeroassist space transfer vehicle (ASTV). It would also apply to other space vehicles subject to high convective and radiative heating during atmospheric entry. The thermal performance of this composite insulation as exposed to a simulated atmospheric entry environment in a plasma arc test facility is described. Other thermophysical properties which affect the thermal response of this composite insulation is included. It shows that this composite insulation is effective as a thermal protection system at total heating rates up to 30. 6 W/sq cm...|$|E
5000|$|The PVC coating (vinyl Organisol or Plastisol) {{contains}} {{chemicals to}} achieve the desired color, water, mildew resistance, and flame retardancy. Fabric can also be manufactured with levels of light transmission that range from very transparent to completely opaque. After the coating {{has been applied to}} the <b>scrim,</b> the <b>fabric</b> is put through a heating chamber that dries the liquid coating.|$|R
50|$|With an open-weave or mesh {{polyester}} scrim, {{the exterior}} vinyl films bond to themselves through the {{openings in the}} <b>fabric.</b> Heavier <b>fabric</b> <b>scrims,</b> however, are too tightly woven to allow the same bonding. In this case, an adhesive is used to bond the exterior films to the base fabric.|$|R
50|$|The PVC coating liquid (vinyl Organisol or Plastisol) {{contains}} {{chemicals to}} achieve the desired properties of color, water and mildew resistance, and flame retardancy. Fabric can also be manufactured that contains high levels of light transmission or can be made completely opaque. After the coating {{has been applied to}} the <b>scrim,</b> the <b>fabric</b> is put through a heating chamber that dries the liquid coating. PVC coatings are available in a range of colors, although non-standard colors can be pricey. Colors may be subject to minimum order runs that allow the coating machine to clear out traces of any previous color.|$|R
5000|$|The edge of {{the pond}} liner is {{generally}} rolled {{over the top of}} the soil slope and secured in an anchor trench or it can be fixed to a vertical wall made of wood or concrete. Box-shaped pond liners can be made for rectangular structures. The vast majority of flexible pond liners (aka, geomembranes) are available commercially and are manufactured using the following polymers; HDPE, LLDPE, fPP, PVC, EPDM. They can also be manufactured with a <b>fabric</b> <b>scrim</b> between two plys of the polymer, e.g., PE-R, CSPE-R, fPP-R and EPDM-R. Geomembranes can also be made in-situ by spraying a polymer (polyurea, or equal) directly on a geotextile substrate. The lifetime of these various ponds liners depends greatly on whether they are exposed or covered. [...] Clay liners can also be used which have extremely long lifetimes as long as they do not dry and crack by shrinkage and/or settlement.|$|R
40|$|WO 2010028740 A 1 UPAB: 20100326 NOVELTY - The plaster has a heat {{developing}} layer i. e. matrix layer (2) comprising {{a content}} of carbon nanotubes (CNT) that {{are embedded in}} a matrix such as silicone matrix, coating matrix, web matrix and paper matrix, where the nanotubes contacts {{with each other and}} forms a conductive network. The layer is connected with a supporting material (1) such as polymer films, <b>fabric,</b> knitted <b>fabrics,</b> <b>scrim,</b> nonwoven material, laminate, web, film, foam, paper, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane or metallocene-polyethylene nonwoven fabric.

Uses include {{but are not limited to}} relaxing skin of face after shaving, warm wraps for colds, hot mud packs for muscle cramps and stomachaches. ADVANTAGE - The plaster has the heat developing layer comprising the content of carbon nanotubes, thus providing a uniform heat plaster, and ensuring controlled heat development for a consumer...|$|R
30|$|Often {{described}} as tiered, {{up to four}} tiers excluding the OEMs, tier 1 supplies interior compartments, e.g. seats, engines, floors; tier 2 carries out subassembly activities such as cut and sew and supply parts such as headliners; tier 3 supplies the manufacturing for the upholstery whilst tier 4 supplies the materials (Shishoo 2008). Tiers 1 and 2 companies may be integrated, and ‘cut and sew’ operations may {{be carried out by}} the same company. Fabric laminators supply their services the cut and sew operations (Tier 2). The fabric formation companies may also conduct fabric lamination in-house or out-source. There are many permutations; companies may supply yarn directly to the fabric formation company, foam and scrim directly to a fabric lamination company or only yarn to the fabric formation company and the fabric formation company supplies the <b>scrim</b> to the <b>fabric</b> lamination company. Moreover, the three companies may be integrated (Taylor 2012). An example is the consolidation by tier 1 companies. The OEMs, frustrated by the increasingly longer lead times and operational constraints, only worked with fabric suppliers with cut and sew operations. Tier 1 companies (e.g. Johnson Controls) have bought out fabric companies and become vertically integrated companies with control of upstream and downstream activities making the full range of products from seats, instrument panels, headliners, etc. With 25 % of the market, Johnson Controls vertical integration captures increasing amount of value along the chain but loses flexibility and speed. The independent status of Sage AI is advantageous because it affords flexibility and speed within the system (Taylor 2012).|$|R
