500|$|In 1977, O'Neill saw {{the peak}} of {{interest}} in space colonization, along {{with the publication of}} his first book, [...] He and his wife were flying between meetings, interviews, and hearings. On October 9, the CBS program 60 Minutes ran a segment about space colonies. Later they aired responses from the viewers, which included one from Senator William Proxmire, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee responsible for NASA's budget. His response was, [...] "it's the best argument yet for chopping NASA's funding to the bone .... I <b>say</b> <b>not</b> a penny for this nutty fantasy". He successfully eliminated spending on space colonization research from the budget. In 1978, Paul Werbos wrote for the L-5 newsletter, [...] "no one expects Congress to commit us to O'Neill's concept of large-scale space habitats; people in NASA are almost paranoid about the public relations aspects of the idea". When it became clear that a government funded colonization effort was politically impossible, popular support for O'Neill's ideas started to evaporate.|$|E
500|$|Breckinridge's {{communication}} with his supporters between the meetings indicated greater willingness {{to become a}} candidate, but he instructed Clay to nominate him only if his support exceeded Guthrie's. Many believed that Buchanan supported Breckinridge, but Breckinridge wrote to Beck that [...] "The President is not for me except as a last necessity, that is to <b>say</b> <b>not</b> until his help will not be worth a damn." [...] After {{a majority of the}} delegates, most of them Douglas supporters, voted to replace Alabama and Louisiana's walk-out delegates with new, pro-Douglas men in Baltimore, Virginia's delegation led another walk-out of Southern Democrats and Buchanan-controlled delegates from the northeast and Pacific coast; 105 delegates, including 10 of Kentucky's 24, left, and the remainder nominated Douglas. The walk-outs held a rival nominating convention, styled the National Democratic Convention, at the Maryland Institute in Baltimore. At that convention on June 23, Massachusetts' George B. Loring nominated Breckinridge for president, and he received 81 of the 105 votes cast, the remainder going to Daniel S. Dickinson of New York. Oregon's Joseph Lane was nominated for vice-president.|$|E

2500|$|Paradoxically, if {{this logic}} is accepted, signals in nature evolve {{not to be}} {{efficient}} but, on the contrary, to be elaborate and wasteful {{of time and energy}}. A peacock's tail is the classic illustration. Zahavi's theory is that since peahens are on the look-out for male braggarts and cheats, they insist on a display of quality so costly that only a genuinely fit peacock could afford to pay. Needless to <b>say,</b> <b>not</b> all signals in the animal world are quite as elaborate as a peacock's tail.

A 48-inch (120cm) pipe spilled arsenic and other heavy metals into the river for a week, but was successfully plugged by Duke Energy.

[...] Even though [...] "t might be argued that the brevity of the book and the amount of ground it covers should excuse the less-than-rigorous fashion in which it advances its more controversial arguments... the demands of brevity should clarify and hone, whereas Hitchens manages to be both short and sloppy." ...|$|E

The Latest Decalogue's couplet on murder, [...] "Thou shalt not kill; but needst not strive officiously to keep alive:" [...] is often quoted – usually out of context – in debates on medical ethics {{in the sense that it}} is not right to struggle to keep terminally ill people alive, especially if they are suffering. Further, this couplet influenced Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics (in particular, the First Law's [...] "or through inaction" [...] clause).|$|E

Though it was Brown's vehicle, Houston was a prominent figure throughout the show, receiving as much screen time as Brown. The series aired in 2005 and featured Houston in, what some would <b>say,</b> <b>not</b> her most flattering moments. The Hollywood Reporter said it was [...] "undoubtedly the most disgusting and execrable series ever to ooze its way onto television". Despite the perceived train-wreck nature of the show, the series gave Bravo its highest ratings in its time slot and continued Houston's successful forays into film and television. The show was not renewed for a second season after Houston stated that she would no longer appear in it, and Brown and Bravo could not {{come to an agreement}} for another season.|$|E
2500|$|The Italian {{anthropologist}} Giuseppe Sergi (1901) {{believed that}} ancient Egyptians were the Eastern African (Hamitic) {{branch of the}} Mediterranean race, which he called [...] "Eurafrican". According to Sergi, the Mediterranean race or [...] "Eurafrican" [...] contains three varieties or sub-races: the African (Hamitic) branch, the Mediterranean [...] "proper" [...] branch and the Nordic (depigmentated) branch. Sergi maintained in summary that the Mediterranean race (excluding the depigmentated Nordic or 'white') is: [...] "a brown human variety, neither white nor Negroid, but pure in its elements, that is to <b>say</b> <b>not</b> {{a product of the}} mixture of Whites with Negroes or Negroid peoples". Grafton Elliot Smith modified the theory in 1911, stating that the ancient Egyptians were a dark haired [...] "brown race", [...] most closely [...] "linked by the closest bonds of racial affinity to the Early Neolithic populations of the North African littoral and South Europe", and not Negroid. Smith's [...] "brown race" [...] is not synonymous or equivalent with Sergi's Mediterranean race.|$|E

[...] Film critic Roger Ebert made a similar appraisal of the character in his review of Purple Noon, Rene Clement's 1960 film adaptation of The Talented Mr. Ripley: [...] "Ripley is a criminal of intelligence and cunning who gets away with murder. He's charming and literate, and a monster. It's insidious, the way Highsmith seduces us into identifying with him and sharing his selfishness; Ripley believes that getting his own way is worth whatever price anyone else might have to pay.
