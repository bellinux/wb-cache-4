40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review {{literature}} on <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> in Japanese manufacturing environment. It examines the changes in the manufacturing environment in Japan that has lowered the significance of <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> in Japanese firms and investigates the current level of its applicability in Japanese firms. Design/methodology/approach – The paper systematically categorizes the relevant literature and reviews it methodologically. Findings – The paper finds that <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> is still being used by a large number of firms both in developing and developed countries. Overall, the research suggests that the importance of <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> has not declined to such a low level despite the technological changes. In Japan <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> is still used for different purposes despite its apparent weaknesses. Research limitations/implications – This is not an empirical investigation of <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> in Japanese manufacturing firms. Originality/value – The paper will be useful to researchers, cost accountants and others concerned with product costing to understand the importance of <b>standard</b> <b>costing.</b> It is also expected that the current research will help reveal whether or not one should continue teaching <b>standard</b> <b>costing</b> in the classroom...|$|R

5000|$|Backflush {{accounting}} is {{a certain}} type of [...] "postproduction issuing", it is a product costing approach, used in a Just-In-Time (JIT) operating environment, in which costing is delayed until goods are finished. Backflush accounting delays the recording of costs until after the events have taken place, then <b>standard</b> <b>costs</b> are used to work backwards to 'flush' out the manufacturing costs. The result is that detailed tracking of costs is eliminated. Journal entries to inventory accounts may be delayed until the time of product completion or even the time of sale, and <b>standard</b> <b>costs</b> are used to assign costs to units when journal entries are made. Backflushing transaction has two steps: one step of the transaction reports the produced part which serves to increase the quantity on-hand of the produced part and a second step which relieves the inventory of all the component parts. Component part numbers and quantities-per are taken from the standard bill of material (BOM). This represents a huge saving over the traditional method of a) issuing component parts one at a time, usually to a discrete work order, b) receiving the finished parts into inventory, and c) returning any unused components, one at a time, back into inventory.|$|E

50|$|Under most {{circumstances}} it is {{not necessary}} to calculate product or service costs. Traditional manufacturing companies usually calculate a fully absorbed product cost using complex methods for the allocation of overhead costs, and they use these product costs for decision-making, inventory valuation, and performance measurements in the form of variance analysis and such metrics as individual efficiency. Similar methods are used in service organizations to estimate the cost of each service they provide. Companies employing lean accounting methods recognize that <b>standard</b> <b>costs</b> and other methods for fully absorbed product or service costing lead to poor decisions and motivate anti-lean behavior. These companies also find that there is no need to calculate a product cost because all the uses of product costs within traditional companies can be addressed in lean accounting using simpler and better methods. Decision-making, inventory valuation, performance measurements, and other uses of fully absorbed product costs are all achieved using other lean accounting methods. If a product cost is required - for reporting international transfer pricing, for example - then these can be calculated using simpler and more lean-focused methods like Features & Characteristics costing.|$|E
