5|$|Calleia excelled as {{the villain}} in Hollywood films, but he fought against typecasting {{and created a}} {{succession}} of darkly mysterious characters edged with humor in films including Algiers (1938), Five Came Back (1939), Golden Boy (1939), The Glass Key (1942) and Gilda (1946). During World War II Calleia led the Malta War Relief organization in the US. After the war he continued to work <b>steadily</b> <b>in</b> motion pictures and television, and he starred in the 1948 London stage premiere of Arthur Miller's Tony Award-winning play, All My Sons.

5|$|Greater London's {{population}} declined <b>steadily</b> <b>in</b> {{the decades}} after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6million in 1939 to around 6.8million in the 1980s. The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury, with the London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration, including the Canary Wharf development. This was borne out of London's ever-increasing role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s. The Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of Scotland grew <b>steadily</b> <b>in</b> the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901. Even {{with the growth}} of industry there were insufficient good jobs, as a result, during the period 1841–1931, about 2 million Scots emigrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England. By the 21st century, there were about as many people who were Scottish Canadians and Scottish Americans as the 5 million remaining in Scotland. Scots born migrants played {{a leading role in the}} foundation and principles of the United States (John Witherspoon, John Paul Jones, Andrew Carnegie), Canada (John A MacDonald, James Murray, Tommy Douglas), Australia (Lachlan Macquarie, Thomas Brisbane, Andrew Fisher) and New Zealand (James Mckenzie, Peter Fraser).|$|E
5|$|When {{a cluster}} of stars is formed {{at about the same}} time, the life span of these stars will depend on their {{individual}} masses. The most massive stars will leave the main sequence first, followed <b>steadily</b> <b>in</b> sequence by stars of ever lower masses. Thus the stars will evolve in order of their position on the main sequence, proceeding from the most massive at the left toward the right of the HR diagram. The current position where stars in this cluster are leaving the main sequence is known as the turn-off point. By knowing the main sequence lifespan of stars at this point, it becomes possible to estimate the age of the cluster.|$|E

5|$|NWOBHM bands {{had been}} touring <b>steadily</b> <b>in</b> the United States, {{but had not}} yet {{received}} enough FM radio airplay there to make a significant impression on American charts. Def Leppard remedied that, releasing Pyromania {{at the beginning of}} 1983, an album with a more melodic and FM-friendly approach in comparison with the more aggressive sound of their earlier music. The band's goal of reaching a wider international audience, which included many female fans, was attained completely in the US, where Pyromania peaked at No.2 on the Billboard 200 chart behind Michael Jackson's Thriller. Thanks to a string of hit singles and the heavy rotation of their music videos on the recently launched MTV, the album had sold more than six millions copies in the US by 1984 and made Def Leppard superstars. The overwhelming international success of Pyromania induced both American and British bands to follow Def Leppard's example, giving a decisive boost to the more commercial and melodic glam metal and heralding the end of the NWOBHM.|$|E
5|$|On the {{accession}} of Queen Victoria, {{he took up}} {{roles in}} the Royal Household, becoming a groom-in-waiting on 27 July 1837, and {{taking part in the}} coronation procession the following year. He still retained his army commission, and progressed <b>steadily</b> <b>in</b> rank through his retirement, becoming a major-general on 23 November 1841, lieutenant-general on 11 November 1851, and full general on 14 August 1859; on 1 September 1848, he took the colonelcy of the 83rd (County of Dublin) Regiment of Foot. In 1855, he accompanied the young Prince Alfred to Geneva to supervise his studies there. In 1858 he was appointed a member of the Royal Commission set up to look into the functioning of the militia. He resigned his role as groom in waiting on 18 November 1859, because of ill-health; he was appointed an extra groom in waiting on 28 March 1860, and promoted Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 18 May 1860.|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gas}} atoms, like atoms in most groups, {{increase}} <b>steadily</b> <b>in</b> atomic radius from one period {{to the next}} due to {{the increasing number of}} electrons. The size of the atom is related to several properties. For example, the ionization potential decreases with an increasing radius because the valence electrons in the larger noble gases are farther away from the nucleus and are therefore not held as tightly together by the atom. Noble gases have the largest ionization potential among the elements of each period, which reflects the stability of their electron configuration and is related to their relative lack of chemical reactivity. Some of the heavier noble gases, however, have ionization potentials small enough to be comparable to those of other elements and molecules. It was the insight that xenon has an ionization potential {{similar to that of the}} oxygen molecule that led Bartlett to attempt oxidizing xenon using platinum hexafluoride, an oxidizing agent known to be strong enough to react with oxygen. Noble gases cannot accept an electron to form stable anions; that is, they have a negative electron affinity.|$|E

5|$|Following its {{evacuation}} from Tobruk, the 2/43rd was {{landed in}} Alexandria, after which it moved by buses to Amiriya {{and then by}} train, crossing the Suez at Kantara, and arriving in camp at Kilo 89 in Palestine on 20 October. There, the battalion was rested, and received several drafts of reinforcements, mainly consisting of volunteers from Western Australia. In mid-December, after the battalion had moved to Khassa, Crellin handed over command of the battalion to Lieutenant Colonel William Wain, a former Militia officer who had served with the 7th Battalion during World War I, and who came on promotion from the 2/16th Battalion, where he had served as battalion second-in-command. After a bitterly cold Christmas in Palestine, early in the new year, the 9th Division was ordered to move to Syria, where it was to join the Allied garrison that had been established there following the brief Syria–Lebanon campaign to counter a possible Axis attack on the Allied flank through the Caucasus Mountains. The 9th Division was assigned to guard the Tripoli area, in the northern sector of the Allied defence system. Under this plan, the 2/43rd was assigned winter quarters at Arbe, and it spent four months in the Lebanese mountains near Jebel Tourbol, before moving to Bechmezzine in May. Guard duties included manning checkpoints {{at the mouth of}} the Chekka Tunnel, while brigade-level exercises were conducted in the Syrian desert around Forgloss in early June. At the end of the month, the 9th Division received orders to move back to Egypt as the situation in North Africa became critical for the Allies, as the Afrika Korps advancing <b>steadily</b> <b>in</b> the Western Desert.|$|E
5|$|This period saw {{a process}} of {{rehabilitation}} for Highland culture. In the 1820s, {{as part of the}} Romantic revival, tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe, prompted by the popularity of Macpherson's Ossian cycle and then Walter Scott's Waverley novels. However, the Highlands remained very poor and traditional. The desire to improve agriculture and profits led to the Highland Clearances, in which much {{of the population of the}} Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout Britain, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. One result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, or further afield to England, Canada, America or Australia. The population of Scotland grew <b>steadily</b> <b>in</b> the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901.
