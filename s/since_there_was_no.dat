5|$|All Operation Crossroads {{operations}} {{were designed to}} keep personnel from being exposed to more than 0.1 roentgen (R) per day.

5|$|In late 1974, the CFA {{decided to}} {{schedule}} a special championship. Although board members were uncertain whether Nea Salamina should play (due to the refugee problem), they decided to participate so the team could remain in the Cypriot First Division and stay alive. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> permanent stadium, the team used GSZ Stadium in 1974–75, the Deryneia municipal stadium in 1975–76, the GSZ Stadium again in 1976–77, Dasaki Stadium in Dasaki Achnas in 1977–78 and GSZ Stadium from 1978 to 1980.|$|E
5|$|On May 21, 1952, {{large numbers}} of trucks were spotted by Jersey City police {{entering}} {{the city on the}} skyway. Upon pulling over the drivers, they were told that the exit in Newark for the truck route was closed for construction. A call to Newark police confirmed the situation. Hudson County police refused to force trucks to exit before Jersey City, <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> state law banning trucks from the skyway. Jersey City Police Chief James McNamara gave in, and trucks were temporarily allowed to use the skyway, though only in one direction.|$|E

5|$|Plante's {{first foray}} into {{organized}} hockey came at age 12. He was watching his school's team practice, when the coach ordered the goaltender off the ice after a heated argument over his play, and Plante asked to replace him. The coach permitted him to play <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> other available goaltender; it was quickly apparent that Plante could hold his own, despite the other players being many years older than he was. He impressed the coach and stayed on as the team's number one goaltender.|$|E

5|$|Schmeisser helped {{organize}} and {{played on the}} Mount Washington Lacrosse Club, a highly successful Baltimore-based amateur team. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> professional league, many former college lacrosse stars played for Mount Washington.

In 1904, Schmeisser and Abercrombie co-authored Lacrosse: From Candidate to Team, a book which became the sport's standard text for the next fifty years. He also helped promote lacrosse at the University of Maryland and the Naval Academy.|$|E
5|$|The 114th IOC Session, in 2002, {{limited the}} Summer Games {{programme}} {{to a maximum}} of 28 sports, 301 events, and 10,500 athletes. Three years later, at the 117th IOC Session, the first major programme revision was performed, which resulted in the exclusion of baseball and softball from the official programme of the 2012 London Games. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> agreement in the promotion of two other sports, the 2012 programme featured just 26 sports.

5|$|When Lancaster {{arrived at}} the town of Boroughbridge, Harclay was already in {{possession}} of the bridge crossing the river.

5|$|As it grew {{beyond its}} {{regional}} affiliations in the 1930s, college football garnered increased national attention. Four new bowl games were created: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, the Sun Bowl in 1935, and the Cotton Bowl in 1937. In lieu {{of an actual}} national championship, these bowl games, along with the earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way to match up teams from distant {{regions of the country}} that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the Associated Press began its weekly poll of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> national championship game, {{the final version of the}} AP poll was used to determine who was crowned the National Champion of college football.|$|E
5|$|Communications {{with the}} outside world went through a single Forest Service line until April 1943, when it was {{replaced}} by five Army telephone lines. This was increased to eight in March 1945. There were also three teletypewriters with encoding machines. The first was installed in March 1943, and two more were added in May 1943. One was removed in November 1945. There were telephones in the offices, but none in private residences, as the Army regarded this as a security hazard. There were some public phones in the township for emergencies. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> way to prevent the lines being tapped, classified information could not be discussed over the phone lines. Initially the phone lines were operable only during business hours until enough WACs arrived to man the switchboard around the clock.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{were raised}} by Antonio Saldías (pen name Don Antonio de Petrel) {{regarding}} {{the appropriateness of the}} date used to celebrate the anniversary of Pichilemu, which commemorated the creation of the commune, on 21 December 1891, a date also used in the coat of arms. Saldías pointed out that, <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> act of foundation of Pichilemu nor record of date of the first inhabitation of the area by the Promaucaes, the date of 24 January 1544, specified in the title of encomienda of Topocalma given by Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia to Juan Gómez de Almagro, another conquistador, was the most correct date to be used to commemorate the anniversary of Pichilemu. The current territory of Pichilemu was part of the encomienda of Topocalma.|$|E

5|$|In the afternoon, PT-41 and PT-32 {{made their}} way to Tagauayan, where they found PT-34. There was a {{discussion}} about whether to proceed to Mindanao, or wait for Permit. Bulkeley warned that the seas might even be higher. But, <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> assurance that the submarine would make it, MacArthur decided to continue, departing in daylight at 18:00 so as to be sure to meet their air transport there. Since PT-32 had no fuel to make Mindanao, its passengers were divided between PT-41 and PT-34. Soon after they had departed, PT-35 belatedly arrived at rendezvous point. Akers found the crew of PT-32 there, and discovered that the other two boats had been and gone. He therefore set out for Cagayan de Oro as well.|$|E
5|$|Books were expensive, {{since each}} copy {{had to be}} written out {{individually}} on a roll of papyrus (volumen) by scribes who had apprenticed to the trade. The codex—a book with pages bound to a spine—was still a novelty {{in the time of}} the poet Martial (1st century AD), {{but by the end of}} the 3rd century was replacing the volumen and was the regular form for books with Christian content. Commercial production of books had been established by the late Republic, and by the 1st century AD certain neighbourhoods of Rome were known for their bookshops (tabernae librariae), which were found also in Western provincial cities such as Lugdunum (present-day Lyon, France). The quality of editing varied wildly, and some ancient authors complain about error-ridden copies, as well as plagiarism or forgery, <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> copyright law. A skilled slave copyist (servus litteratus) could be valued as highly as 100,000 sesterces.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, United States Supreme Court justice Stephen Johnson Field {{assigned}} Deady {{to serve}} as a circuit court judge for the United States circuit court located in San Francisco, California. Deady did the same in 1868 and 1869 <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> circuit court judge assigned to the West Coast at that time, spending three months in San Francisco each year. This was a common practice during this period, as United States Supreme Court justices still rode circuit, and often assigned federal district court judges to serve on the appellate level circuit courts. The Judiciary Act of 1869 reduced much of this process, as did the Judiciary Act of 1891 that established the current United States courts of appeals with Oregon in the Ninth Circuit. While serving on the district court, Deady {{served as president of the}} Board of Regents of the State University (later University of Oregon) from 1873 to 1893. He also designed the university’s seal, which is still used by the school.|$|E

5|$|In 221BC, {{the state}} of Qin {{completed}} its conquest over the other Warring States and united China under Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China. These conquests, combined with the Legalist reforms started by Shang Yang in the 4th century BC, transformed China from a loose confederation of feudal states to an authoritarian empire. With the transformation, Qin became able to command a far greater assembly of labourers {{to be used in}} public works than the prior feudal kingdoms. Also, once unification was achieved, Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no more internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them. Soon after the conquests, in the year 215 BC, the emperor sent the famed general Meng Tian to the Ordos region to drive out the Xiongnu nomads settled there, who had risen from beyond the fallen marginal states along the northern frontier. Qin's campaign against the Xiongnu was preemptive in nature, <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> pressing nomadic menace to be faced at the time; its aim was to annexe the ambiguous territories of the Ordos and to clearly define the Qin's northern borders. Once the Xiongnu were chased away, Meng Tian introduced 30,000 settler families to colonize the newly conquered territories.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December, at {{approximately}} 07:00, the independent HV armoured-mechanised unit advanced northwest along the Kupa, towards Gračanica. During the advance, {{one of the}} tanks was captured and its crew killed after the capture. Nearly simultaneously, the JNA commenced a tank and mortar attack against Stankovac and the river crossing at Šišinec. The HV armoured-mechanised unit and the 1st Battalion of the 102nd Infantry Brigade panicked, believing the crossing point was lost, and started to fall back to Šišinec in disarray, sustaining considerable casualties. <b>Since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> way to transport the remaining HV armour across the Kupa River, the tanks were destroyed {{by one of the}} force's own tanks. That tank was then destroyed with explosives to prevent its capture. As there were too few boats at the river crossing to allow a quick retreat, some of the troops swam across the river, causing several to drown in very cold water. The command post of the brigade fell back to Galdovo, while the troops started to retreat to Zagreb. The entire brigade was back in Zagreb by 15 December.|$|E
5|$|On 6August1860 the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway (A), {{with the}} 3rd Duke (then still Marquess of Chandos) as {{chairman}} and Sir Harry Verney as deputy chairman, was incorporated by Act of Parliament with the object of connecting the Buckinghamshire Railway (by now operated by the LNWR) to Aylesbury. The 2nd Duke used his influence to ensure the new route would run via Quainton, near his remaining estates around Wotton, instead of the intended more direct route via Pitchcott. Beset by financial difficulties, the line took over eight years to build, eventually opening on 23September1868. The new line {{was connected to the}} Wycombe Railway's Aylesbury station, and joined the existing Buckinghamshire Railway lines {{at the point where the}} Oxford–Bletchley line and the line to Buckingham already met. Verney Junction railway station was built at the point where the lines joined, named after Sir Harry who owned the land on which it was built, <b>since</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> nearby town. Aylesbury now had railways to the east, north and southwest, but no line southeast towards London and the Channel ports.|$|E
