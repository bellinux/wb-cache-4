50|$|The <b>Adonis</b> <b>blue</b> {{is found}} across Europe from Eastern and Central Europe across to {{southeast}} England and the Iberian Peninsula.|$|R
50|$|German {{entomologist}} S. A. von Rottemburg {{described the}} <b>Adonis</b> <b>blue</b> in 1775 as Papilio bellargus, noting {{it was very}} rare locally but came to his garden in June.|$|R
50|$|The {{reserve is}} home to plants and {{butterflies}} of chalk grassland. The flowers include a number of orchids and the Chiltern gentian; the butterflies include the silver-spotted skipper and the <b>Adonis</b> <b>blue.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Adonis</b> <b>blue</b> (Polyommatus bellargus) is a {{butterfly}} {{in the family}} Lycaenidae. It {{is found in the}} Palearctic ecozone (Western Europe, Central Europe, South Europe, South Russia, Iraq, Iran, Caucasus, Transcaucasus, Turkey).|$|R
50|$|The chalk {{grassland}} habitat is particularly attractive to {{many species of}} butterflies such as the <b>Adonis</b> <b>blue,</b> the chalkhill blue, marbled white, silver-spotted skipper, the dark green fritillary, and the silver-washed fritillary. Over 30 species of butterflies have been recorded on the reserve.|$|R
50|$|The site {{is notable}} for (in the {{grassland}} areas) Festuca ovina (sheep's fescue), Avenula pratensis (meadow oat-grass), Brachypodium pinnatum (tor-grass), and Polyommatus bellargus (<b>Adonis</b> <b>Blue)</b> - a nationally scarce species of butterfly, {{and in the}} scrub areas, Crataegus monogyna (common hawthorn), and Hedera helix (ivy).|$|R
50|$|The hill {{is now a}} National Nature Reserve (NNR) {{with common}} plants {{including}} milkwort, salad burnet, horseshoe vetch, squinancywort, pyramidal orchid and wild thyme. Rarer species include bastard toadflax, meadow saxifrage, early gentian and dwarf sedge. Butterflies include dingy skipper, grizzled skipper, chalkhill <b>blue</b> and <b>adonis</b> <b>blue.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hippocrepis comosa is the {{exclusive}} food plant of the caterpillars of chalkhill blue (Polyommatus coridon) and <b>Adonis</b> <b>blue</b> (Polyommatus bellargus) butterflies. Populations that support such butterflies occur on longstanding ungrazed meadows, quarries, edges of paths and wasteland; outside of southern England and the Midlands (e.g. the Gower and Yorkshire populations) {{the climate is}} unsuitable for the butterflies.|$|R
50|$|Several {{species of}} {{butterfly}} became extinct {{owing to the}} loss of habitat to scrub, notably the <b>Adonis</b> <b>blue,</b> silver-studded blue, dingy skipper, and dark green fritillary. Others such as the chalkhill blue and small blue were at the brink of extinction, but are now flourishing again. Indeed, the hill has now probably the largest metapopulation of the small blue in the UK.|$|R
5000|$|This is a {{steeply sloping}} hill, {{which is a}} fine example of grazed chalk {{grassland}} in the southern Buckinghamshire Chilterns. There is a wide variety of plants, some of which provide food for the larvae of important butterflies on the site. Two butterflies are rare, the silver spotted skipper [...] and the <b>Adonis</b> <b>blue.</b> Another rare invertebrate is the orange clearwing moth.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} notable things about Lydden is the {{surrounding}} landscape. Lydden is set in a steep sided valley with grazing pasture and pockets of woodland along the valley side facing north west and an extensive National Nature Reserve (The Lydden Temple Ewell NNR) facing south west. The NNR is famous for its chalk grassland habitat and species including the <b>adonis</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly.|$|R
5000|$|... "Anthills {{produced}} by the yellow meadow ant Lasius flavus are a feature of several slopes. The grassland supports a variety of butterfly species including dingy skipper, dark green fritillary and common <b>blue.</b> The <b>adonis</b> <b>blue</b> is also found where its larval food plant, horseshoe vetch Hippocrepis comosa grows in favourable conditions. In Britain this butterfly is confined to {{a limited number of}} chalk and limestone grassland sites in the south." ...|$|R
50|$|The scrub and {{woodland}} provide breeding habitats {{for many}} species of birds. Folkestone Downs is particularly notable for its insect fauna. Up to 32 species of butterfly have been recorded on the downs including the <b>Adonis</b> <b>blue</b> (Lysandra bellargus), chalkhill blue (Polyommatus coridon) and small blue (Cupido minimus). Several rare species of moth have been recorded including the straw belle (Aspitates gilvaria) and the annulet moth (Charissa obscurata).|$|R
50|$|More {{than thirty}} species of {{butterfly}} {{have been reported}} from the area, several of which—the marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia), Duke of Burgundy (Hamearis lucina), chalkhill blue (Polyommatus coridon), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne) and <b>Adonis</b> <b>blue</b> (Polyommatus bellargus)—are declining in the United Kingdom on account of habitat destruction. Other insects reported include the uncommon burrowing bug species Canthophorus dubius, the green forester (Adscita statices), cistus forester (A. geryon), and scarce forester (Jordanita globulariae).|$|R
50|$|Chalk {{grassland}} {{also supports}} a rich fauna, particularly insects. Notable butterfly species include <b>Adonis</b> <b>blue</b> (Lysandra bellargus) and silver-spotted skipper (Hesperia comma) {{which may be}} found on warm, sheltered, south facing slopes. The chalk downland above the Stour Valley is the only British site for the black-veined moth (Siona lineata). Other notable moth species that occur on the North Downs include the fiery clearwing moth (Bembecia chrysidiformis) and the straw belle moth (Aspitates gilvaria).|$|R
25|$|The site is of high entomological interest, with 29 {{varieties}} of resident breeding species of butterfly recorded. The horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa) is locally plentiful and supports both the chalkhill blue (Lysandra coridon) and the <b>Adonis</b> <b>blue</b> (Lysandra bellargus) butterflies. Other butterfly species {{to be found}} on and around the site include for the Duke of Burgundy (Hamaeris lucina), the grizzled skipper (Pyrgus malvae), the dark green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja), and the small blue (Cupido minimus).|$|R
50|$|Found across Europe; in Britain, the <b>Adonis</b> <b>Blue</b> {{is at the}} {{northern}} extreme of its range and has always been restricted to the warmer dry calcareous grasslands of southern England. It has suffered a huge decline in the past 200 years, and has been lost from Cambridgeshire, Essex, Suffolk, and the Chilterns. The strongholds are Dorset, Wiltshire, Sussex and the Isle of Wight. Over the whole of Britain {{there has been a}} decline of over 90% in numbers of this species since 1950.|$|R
50|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the <b>Adonis</b> <b>blue</b> is calcareous grasslands with hot and dry conditions. This {{is because the}} larva feeds on horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa) which is largely restricted to these habitats. This plant flourishes on sheep-grazed pastures and disappears {{after a few years}} when cattle graze. Sometimes human-created landforms provide refuges for the plant and the butterfly; an example of this is on Martin Down in Dorset, where horseshoe vetch only occurs on ancient earthworks with thin calcareous soils.|$|R
50|$|The main chalk {{grassland}} communities are CG4 Brachypodium pinnatum and CG5 Bromus erectus - Brachypodium pinnatum. The reserve supports a rich flora and is notable for its orchids {{which include the}} nationally scarce Burnt Orchid (Neotinea ustulata) and Early Spider Orchid (Ophrys sphegodes). The {{chalk grassland}} is an important site for insects. It is the only site in Kent for the Wart-biter (Decticus verrucivorus) and also supports the Silver-spotted Skipper (Hesperia comma), <b>Adonis</b> <b>Blue</b> (Polyommatus bellargus) and Chalkhill Blue (Polyommatus coridon).|$|R
5000|$|Both sexes have {{a row of}} red spots {{along the}} edge of the hindwings and {{extending}} onto the forewings, though they are generally fainter there, particularly in the males, where they are sometimes missing altogether. There are about a dozen black-centred white spots on the hindwings, nine on the forewings. These usually include one in the middle of the forewing cell, absent in Chapman's and Escher's blues. The fringes on the outer edge of the wings are uniform white, not crossed with black lines(lack checkering), as it is in the chalkhill <b>blue</b> and <b>Adonis</b> <b>blues.</b>|$|R
50|$|The plain is an {{important}} stronghold for declining downland butterflies. A high concentration of colonies of three nationally scarce species, the <b>Adonis</b> <b>blue</b> (Polyommatus bellargus), Duke of Burgundy (Hamearis lucina), and the largest population of marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) on the chalk, occur. A colony of brown hairstreak (Thecla betulae) is present on East Salisbury Plain at one of its two Wiltshire localities. Strong populations of other downland species such as chalkhill blue (Polyommatus coridon) and dark green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja) are found, and of note here is the occurrence of grayling (Hipparchia semele), a butterfly rarely found away from the coast.|$|R
5000|$|The main grass {{species in}} the {{community}} are sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) and red fescue (Festuca rubra) {{and there is an}} absence of the dwarf sedge (Carex humilis), which is common at other downland sites nearby. Flowering plants found in the reserve include such rarities as the early gentian (Gentianella anglica), the burnt-tip orchid (Neotinea ustulata), the lesser butterfly orchid (Platanthera bifolia) and the frog orchid (Coeloglossum viride). These, along with other wildflowers, provide the nectar on which many species of butterfly feed. The butterflies found on the reserve include the internationally rare marsh fritillary, the <b>adonis</b> <b>blue</b> and the chalkhill blue.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Adonis</b> <b>blue</b> is at {{the most}} northerly edge of its range in Britain and has always been {{restricted}} to chalk grassland in the south. It has been declining over {{the last fifty years}} because its habitat has been disappearing through changing agricultural practices. There are efforts from conservation organisations and local Biodiversity Action Plans to encourage the populations of chalk-grassland butterflies through managed grazing programs. The recent hot and dry weather associated with climate change seems to be beneficial for this species by making more habitats suitable. In 2006 it had returned to a site in the Cotswolds in Gloucestershire, where it had vanished 40 years previously.|$|R
50|$|The {{slopes of}} all three {{properties}} form {{one of the largest}} remaining areas of chalk grassland in the county and support a wide range of flowers and butterflies. Plants found in the grassland include autumn gentian, clustered bellflower, blue fleabane, vervain, common rock-rose, horseshoe vetch, kidney vetch, marjoram, yellow-wort, purging flax, wild carrot, chalk milkwort, stemless thistle, eyebright, mouse-ear hawkweed, salad burnet, ragwort, wild thyme, hairy violet, squinancywort, hawkweed ox-tongue, common spotted orchid and pyramidal orchid. Scattered bands of hawthorn scrub provide shelter for insect life and several butterfly species can be found, including chalkhill <b>blue,</b> marbled white, <b>adonis</b> <b>blue,</b> grizzled skipper and dingy skipper.|$|R

50|$|The hill is the Site of Special Scientific Interest and a National Nature Reserve {{managed by}} Natural England. This {{unimproved}} chalk downland {{is home to}} a number of butterfly species, including the <b>Adonis</b> <b>blue,</b> chalkhill blue, common blue, dark green fritillary, Essex skipper, marbled white, meadow brown, silver-spotted skipper, small heath, small skipper, and the speckled wood. There is also a diverse bird population, including the European green woodpecker, commonly seen feeding amongst the many anthills (which are also very important for the lifecycle of the Lycaenidae butterflies) and the turtle dove. Many species of orchid {{can be found on the}} hill or in the immediate vicinity including the fly, bee and frog orchids.|$|R
50|$|Queendown has {{the usual}} plants of chalk grassland, and orchids are well represented, {{particularly}} the fragrant orchid, with scattered groups of early spider, bee and man orchids. Later {{in the year}} autumn lady's-tresses may be found. A good variety of chalk grassland butterflies {{can be seen in}} summer, including the <b>Adonis</b> <b>Blue,</b> re-introduced in 2002. At the bottom of the bank, there is a colony of rabbits which, together with grazing cattle, help to maintain the short sward, essential for the maintenance of many orchid populations. The West Bank has several patches of fly orchid and white helleborine in the scrub and woodland edges. Some particularly good examples of the many large beech trees on the reserve can be seen in this section.|$|R
50|$|Draycott Sleights {{supports}} extensive {{areas of}} traditionally managed species-rich unimproved calcareous grassland. Additional interest {{lies in a}} rich invertebrate fauna. The site is situated on steep south-west facing slopes of the Mendip Hills and ranges in altitude from 90 m to 270 m. 165 species of flowering plant have been recorded. The varied topography together with the widespread scrub provide a number of locations with ideal conditions for invertebrates supporting a rich butterfly fauna typical of unimproved calcareous grassland. 32 species of resident breeding butterfly have been recorded. The occurrence of <b>Adonis</b> <b>blue</b> (Lysandra bellargus), silver-studded blue (Plebejus argus) and small blue (Cupido minimus) is of particular interest. Two nationally scarce species of fly, Symphoromyia immaculata and Bombylius canescens and one nationally scarce species of ant, Myrmica schencki have been recorded for this site.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} species of {{butterfly}} {{to be seen in}} the reserve. Most notable is the silver-studded blue, which remains very abundant in the area, having established a colony on the limestone. Other butterfly species include small blue (seen in May/June and July/August), chalkhill blue (seen in July), dark green fritillary and <b>Adonis</b> <b>blue.</b> Grassland species include dingy skipper, small and large skipper, ringlet, meadow brown and marbled white, while there are migrant species such as the painted lady and clouded yellow. Moth species include the day-flying species six-spot burnet, four-spotted moth and cinnabar, as well as the night flying species Portland ribbon wave, beautiful gothic and valerian pug. Some of the {{many species of}} birds seen at the reserve include warblers and other migrants such as the green woodpecker, raven, peregrine falcon and kestrel.|$|R
40|$|Landscape {{restoration}} has {{the potential}} to mitigate habitat loss and fragmentation. However, restoration can take decades to reach the ecological conditions of the target habitats. The National Trust’s Stonehenge Landscape Restoration Project provides an opportunity to evaluate the ecological benefits against the economic and temporal costs. A field survey between June and September 2010 using Lepidoptera as bio-indicators showed that restored grasslands can approach the ecological conditions of the target chalk grassland habitat within 10 years. However, specialist species like Lysandra bellargus (<b>Adonis</b> <b>blue)</b> were absent from restored grasslands and may require additional management to assist their colonisation. Analysis of the Lepidoptera communities showed that both small-scale habitat heterogeneity and age of the habitat were important for explaining Lepidoptera occurrence. These results demonstrate that habitat restoration at the landscape scale combined with appropriate site-scale management can be a relatively rapid and effective method to restore ecological networks and buffer against future climate change...|$|R
50|$|The area of {{the site}} is 86.7 ha. It is a chalk downland and thus part of the Dorset Downs. The site {{includes}} grassland, scrub and {{a small amount of}} woodland (mostly ash and oak, with a hazel and field maple understory); within the grassland there is a difference in character, and the species that it supports, which varies according to the gradient and aspect of the slopes. While the invertebrates on the site have not been extensively studied, it is known that species such as the rare <b>Adonis</b> <b>blue</b> and marsh fritillary butterflies can be found there; this is in addition to more common species such as the green hairstreak, common blue and gatekeeper. Fungi, particularly grassland varieties, are very well represented at Hog Cliff; the SSSI citation indicates over 60 genera as having been identified, whilst Natural England claim 100 species for the NNR. Cattle and sheep graze the site throughout the year to keep the grassland open.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the south}} of the parish is the Valley of Stones, which in 1906 was {{described}} by Sir Frederick Treves as [...] "a mysterious glen among the downs, on whose grassy slopes many huge stones are scattered." [...] In prehistoric times it was used as a source of building material for nearby constructions such as tombs and stone circles, and within 4 miles are two-thirds of all such structures in the county. Folklore attributes the origin of the stones to have been two giants playing stone-throwing games, but they are the result of conditions {{at the end of the}} last ice age, when freezing and thawing caused sandstone on surrounding hilltops to break up and slump downhill. They form one of the best British examples of a sarsen stone boulder train. The stones and the surrounding dry chalk valley provide habitats for a variety of flora and fauna—including clustered bellflower, autumn gentian, lichens, bryophytes and the <b>adonis</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly—and the area is designated a National Nature Reserve.|$|R
40|$|Five {{microsatellite}} DNA markers {{were isolated}} {{and used to}} quangify population genetic structure among a subset of UK populations of the <b>Adonis</b> <b>blue</b> (Polyommatus bellargus Rottemburg). Specifically, whether population size, degree of isolation or history of bottlenecking in 1976 – 1978 can explain current patterns of genetic variation. The butterfly is at its northern range limit in the UK, where it exists as a highly fragmented metapopulation on isolated pockets of calcareous grassland. Most populations were affected by a severe bottleneck in the late 1970 s, when a drought caused the host plant (Hippocrepis comosa) to wilt. Mantel tests and spatial autocorrelation analysis indicated a significant effect of isolation by distance among the UK populations, a relationship that broke down at greater geographical scales (> 23. 85 km), probably because of large areas of unsuitable habitat presenting barriers to gene flow. Similarly, amova revealed that variation among geographical regions was almost double that observed within regions. Larger populations were found to support {{significantly higher levels of}} genetic diversity, suggesting that small populations may lose genetic diversity through drift. If, as in other butterfly species, low genetic diversity increases the probability of population extinction, then these populations are likely to be under threat. Neither isolation nor a history of bottlenecks appeared to influence genetic diversity. The results indicate that adequate population size a crucial factor in the conservation of genetic diversity in P. bellargus in the...|$|R
