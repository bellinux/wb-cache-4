25|$|A small, {{elongated}} oval <b>static</b> <b>port</b> {{appeared on}} the rear starboard fuselage in late 1944. This was apparently used to more accurately measure the aircraft's altitude.|$|E
25|$|As in all mass-produced aircraft, {{there may}} have been some overlap of these {{features}} as new components became available. In mid-to-late 1944 other features were introduced to both the Typhoon and Tempest: A Rebecca transponder unit was fitted, with the associated aerial appearing under the portside centre section. A small, elongated oval <b>static</b> <b>port</b> appeared on the rear starboard fuselage, just above the red centre spot of the fuselage roundel. This was apparently used to measure the aircraft's altitude more accurately.|$|E
5000|$|... 2 October 1996 - Aeroperú Flight 603 crashed {{because of}} {{blockage}} of the <b>static</b> <b>ports.</b> The <b>static</b> <b>ports</b> {{on the left}} side of the aircraft had been taped over while the aircraft was being waxed and cleaned. After the job was done, the tape was not removed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>static</b> <b>ports</b> {{are located}} on the {{exterior}} of the aircraft, at a location chosen to detect the prevailing atmospheric pressure as accurately as possible, that is, with minimum disturbance from the presence of the aircraft. Some aircraft have <b>static</b> <b>ports</b> {{on both sides of the}} fuselage or empennage, in order to more accurately measure static pressure during slips and skids. Aerodynamic slips and skids cause either or both <b>static</b> <b>ports</b> and pitot tube(s) to present themselves to the relative wind in other than basic forward motion. Thus, the alternative placements on some aircraft.|$|R

500|$|The static {{pressure}} is obtained through a <b>static</b> <b>port.</b> [...] The <b>static</b> <b>port</b> {{is most often}} a flush-mounted hole on the fuselage of an aircraft, and is located where it can access the air flow in a relatively undisturbed area. [...] Some aircraft may have a single <b>static</b> <b>port,</b> while others may have more than one. [...] In situations where an aircraft {{has more than one}} <b>static</b> <b>port,</b> there is usually one located {{on each side of the}} fuselage. [...] With this positioning, an average pressure can be taken, which allows for more accurate readings in specific flight situations. [...] An alternative <b>static</b> <b>port</b> may be located inside the cabin of the aircraft as a backup for when the external static port(s) are blocked. [...] A pitot-static tube effectively integrates the static ports into the pitot probe. [...] It incorporates a second coaxial tube (or tubes) with pressure sampling holes on the sides of the probe, outside the direct airflow, to measure the {{static pressure}}. When the aircraft climbs, static pressure will decrease.|$|E
500|$|A blocked <b>static</b> <b>port</b> is a {{more serious}} {{situation}} because it affects all pitot-static instruments. One {{of the most common}} causes of a blocked <b>static</b> <b>port</b> is airframe icing. [...] A blocked <b>static</b> <b>port</b> will cause the altimeter to freeze at a constant value, the altitude at which the <b>static</b> <b>port</b> became blocked. [...] The vertical speed indicator will become frozen at zero and will not change at all, even if vertical speed increases or decreases. [...] The airspeed indicator will reverse the error that occurs with a clogged pitot tube and cause the airspeed to be read less than it actually is as the aircraft climbs. [...] When the aircraft is descending, the airspeed will be over-reported. [...] In most aircraft with unpressurized cabins, an alternative static source is available and can be selected from within the cockpit.|$|E
500|$|The pitot-static {{system of}} {{instruments}} uses {{the principle of}} air pressure gradient. It works by measuring pressures or pressure differences and using these values to assess the speed and altitude. These pressures can be measured either from the <b>static</b> <b>port</b> (static pressure) or the pitot tube (pitot pressure). [...] The static pressure is used in all measurements, while the pitot pressure is used only to determine airspeed.|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} {{pitot static}} system has two redundant channels. Each channel has a pitot static tube having two <b>static</b> <b>ports</b> and one pitot tube. The altimeter and vertical speed indicator are connected {{to one of the}} <b>static</b> <b>ports</b> of both the systems. The airspeed indicator and airdata computer are connected to the P and S ports of both systems. This method of connecting the {{pitot static system}} to the service improves the system servicability with adequate redundancy...|$|R
25|$|The <b>static</b> <b>ports</b> {{are vital}} to the {{operation}} of virtually all of those flight instruments that provide basic aerodynamic data such as airspeed, altitude and vertical speed, {{not only to the}} pilots but also to the aircraft's computers, which provide additional functions such as warnings when flight characteristics approach dangerous levels. The blockage of all of the <b>static</b> <b>ports</b> {{is one of the few}} common-failure modes resulting in total failure of multiple basic flight instruments and as such is regarded as one of the most serious faults that can occur within the avionics systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{position}} of <b>static</b> <b>ports</b> must be selected carefully by an aircraft designer because position error must be small at all speeds within the operating {{range of the}} aircraft. A calibration chart specific {{to the type of}} aircraft is usually provided.|$|R
500|$|The {{pressure}} altimeter, {{also known}} as the barometric altimeter, is used to determine changes in air pressure that occur as the aircraft's altitude changes. [...] Pressure altimeters must be calibrated prior to flight to register the pressure as an altitude above sea level. [...] The instrument case of the altimeter is airtight and has a vent to the <b>static</b> <b>port.</b> [...] Inside the instrument, there is a sealed aneroid barometer. [...] As pressure in the case decreases, the internal barometer expands, which is mechanically translated into a determination of altitude. [...] The reverse is true when descending from higher to lower altitudes.|$|E
500|$|The {{airspeed}} indicator {{is connected to}} both the pitot and static pressure sources. [...] The difference between the pitot pressure and the static pressure is called dynamic pressure. The greater the dynamic pressure, the higher the airspeed reported. A traditional mechanical {{airspeed indicator}} contains a pressure diaphragm that {{is connected to the}} pitot tube. [...] The case around the diaphragm is airtight and is vented to the <b>static</b> <b>port.</b> [...] The higher the speed, the higher the ram pressure, the more pressure exerted on the diaphragm, and the larger the needle movement through the mechanical linkage.|$|E
500|$|A pitot-static {{system is}} a system of {{pressure-sensitive}} instruments that is most often used in aviation to determine an aircraft's airspeed, Mach number, altitude, and altitude trend. [...] A pitot-static system generally consists of a pitot tube, a <b>static</b> <b>port,</b> and the pitot-static instruments. Other instruments that might be connected are air data computers, flight data recorders, altitude encoders, cabin pressurization controllers, and various airspeed switches. [...] Errors in pitot-static system readings can be extremely dangerous as the information obtained from the pitot static system, such as altitude, is potentially safety-critical. [...] Several commercial airline disasters have been traced to {{a failure of the}} pitot-static system.|$|E
25|$|Later {{the same}} year (1996), Aeroperú Flight 603, also {{operated}} with a Boeing 757, suffered a similar but far more difficult situation (<b>static</b> <b>ports</b> blocked by tape, rendering all airspeed indicators and pressure altimeters unusable) and crashed in the ocean off Peru.|$|R
50|$|Instead of {{separate}} pitot and <b>static</b> <b>ports,</b> a pitot-static tube (also called a Prandtl tube) may be employed, {{which has a}} second tube coaxial with the pitot tube with holes on the sides, outside the direct airflow, to measure the static pressure.|$|R

500|$|Another {{class of}} {{inherent}} errors {{is that of}} position error. [...] A position error is produced by the aircraft's static pressure being different from the air pressure remote from the aircraft. [...] This error {{is caused by the}} air flowing past the <b>static</b> <b>port</b> at a speed different from the aircraft's true airspeed. [...] Position errors may provide positive or negative errors, depending on one of several factors. [...] These factors include airspeed, angle of attack, aircraft weight, acceleration, aircraft configuration, {{and in the case of}} helicopters, rotor downwash. [...] There are two categories of position errors, which are [...] "fixed errors" [...] and [...] "variable errors". [...] Fixed errors are defined as errors which are specific to a particular model of aircraft. [...] Variable errors are caused by external factors such as deformed panels obstructing the flow of air, or particular situations which may overstress the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|The variometer, {{also known}} as the {{vertical}} speed indicator (VSI) or the vertical velocity indicator (VVI), is the pitot-static instrument used {{to determine whether or not}} an aircraft is flying in level flight. [...] The vertical speed specifically shows the rate of climb or the rate of descent, which is measured in feet per minute or meters per second. [...] The vertical speed is measured through a mechanical linkage to a diaphragm located within the instrument. [...] The area surrounding the diaphragm is vented to the <b>static</b> <b>port</b> through a calibrated leak (which also may be known as a [...] "restricted diffuser"). [...] When the aircraft begins to increase altitude, the diaphragm will begin to contract at a rate faster than that of the calibrated leak, causing the needle to show a positive vertical speed. [...] The reverse of this situation is true when an aircraft is descending. [...] The calibrated leak varies from model to model, but the average time for the diaphragm to equalize pressure is between 6 and 9 seconds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pitot tube}} and <b>static</b> <b>port</b> on an {{aircraft}} {{are used to}} determine the airspeed of the aircraft. These two devices are connected to the airspeed indicator, which determines the dynamic pressure of the airflow past the aircraft. [...] Dynamic pressure is the difference between stagnation pressure and static pressure. [...] Bernoulli's principle is used to calibrate the airspeed indicator so that it displays the indicated airspeed appropriate to the dynamic pressure.|$|E
25|$|Later {{investigation}} into the accident revealed that adhesive tape had been accidentally left over {{some or all of}} the <b>static</b> <b>ports</b> (on the underside of the fuselage) after the aircraft was cleaned, eventually leading to the crash. Employee Eleuterio Chacaliaza had left the tape on by mistake.|$|R
50|$|In aircraft, {{the static}} {{pressure}} is generally measured using the <b>static</b> <b>ports</b> {{on the side}} of the fuselage. The dynamic pressure measured can be used to determine the indicated airspeed of the aircraft. The diaphragm arrangement described above is typically contained within the airspeed indicator, which converts the dynamic pressure to an airspeed reading by means of mechanical levers.|$|R
25|$|An {{airspeed}} indicator is a {{differential pressure gauge}} with the pressure reading expressed in units of speed, rather than pressure. The airspeed {{is derived from the}} difference between the ram air pressure from the pitot tube, or stagnation pressure, and the static pressure. The pitot tube is mounted facing forward; the static pressure is frequently detected at <b>static</b> <b>ports</b> on one or both sides of the aircraft. Sometimes both pressure sources are combined in a single probe, a pitot-static tube. The static pressure measurement is subject to error due to inability to place the <b>static</b> <b>ports</b> at positions where the pressure is true static pressure at all airspeeds and attitudes. The correction for this error is the position error correction (PEC) and varies for different aircraft and airspeeds. Further errors of 10% or more are common if the airplane is flown in “uncoordinated” flight.|$|R

Severe <b>Static.</b> <b>Port</b> Washington tried to call the Cavalier for the next 15 minutes but did not get a reply.

50|$|The pilots {{struggled}} {{to navigate the}} aircraft after the failure of several of its cockpit instruments.

The cause of the instrument failure was a maintenance worker's failure to remove tape covering the <b>static</b> <b>ports</b> necessary to provide correct instrument data to the cockpit.|$|R
5000|$|October 2, 1996: Flight 603, an AeroPerú Boeing 757-23A {{registration}} N52AW {{flying the}} Miami-Lima-Santiago, Chile route {{crashed into the}} Pacific Ocean some minutes after its take off from Jorge Chávez International Airport, killing all on board.

50|$|The {{pitot tube}} is {{installed}} in the nose air intake, which gives it good protection during ground handling. The <b>static</b> <b>ports</b> are located 14 inches (35.6 cm) aft of the nose and the fuselage sides.

50|$|All {{aircraft}} {{are equipped with}} a small hole in {{the surface of the}} aircraft called the <b>static</b> <b>port.</b> The air pressure {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>static</b> <b>port</b> is conveyed by a conduit to the altimeter and the airspeed indicator. This <b>static</b> <b>port</b> and the conduit constitute the aircraft's static system. The objective of the static system is to sense the pressure of the air at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying. In an ideal static system the air pressure fed to the altimeter and airspeed indicator is equal to the pressure of the air at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying.|$|E

2500|$|Because a {{maintenance}} worker {{had failed to}} remove tape covering the <b>static</b> <b>ports,</b> the air data computers were unable to report the correct airspeed and altitude.
