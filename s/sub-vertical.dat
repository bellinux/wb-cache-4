60|$|On another {{occasion}} some fine plants, {{after having been}} left for 2 hrs. in the gas, were immediately given bits of meat in the usual manner, and on their exposure to the air most of their tentacles became in 12 m. curved into a vertical or <b>sub-vertical</b> position, but in an extremely irregular manner; some only {{on one side of}} the leaf and some on the other. They remained in this position for some time; the tentacles with the bits of meat not having at first moved more quickly or farther inwards than the others without meat. But after 2 hrs. 20 m. the former began to move, and steadily went on bending until they reached the centre. Next morning, after 22 hrs., all the tentacles on these leaves were closely clasped over the meat which had been carried to their centres; whilst the vertical and <b>sub-vertical</b> tentacles on the other leaves to which no meat had been given had fully re-expanded. Judging, however, from the subsequent action of a weak solution of carbonate of ammonia on one of these latter leaves, it had not perfectly recovered its excitability and power of movement in 22 hrs.; but another leaf, after an additional 24 hrs., had completely recovered, judging from the manner in which it clasped a fly placed on its disc.|$|E

The cliffs extend inland for about 1900 to 2300 ft, rising to about 180 m above sea level. Fossilized wood and leaf remains were discovered {{near the base}} of these cliffs in 1996. The cliffs were named for Robert George Carruthers (1880-1965), an English stratigrapher, invertebrate palaeontologist, and quaternary geologist with the British Geological Survey.

50|$|The Pieniny Klippen Belt is in geology a tectonically and orographically {{remarkable}} {{zone in the}} Western Carpathians, with a {{very complex}} geological structure. It is a narrow (only 0.4 to 19 km) and extremely long (about 600 km) north banded zone of extreme shortening and <b>sub-vertical</b> strike-slip fault zone, with complex geological history, where only fragments of individual strata and facies are preserved.

5000|$|A {{rockfall}} or rock-fall {{refers to}} quantities of rock falling freely from a cliff face. The term {{is also used}} for collapse of rock from roof or walls of mine or quarry workings. A rockfall is a fragment of rock (a block) detached by sliding, toppling, or falling, that falls along a vertical or <b>sub-vertical</b> cliff, proceeds down slope by bouncing and flying along ballistic trajectories or by rolling on talus or debris slopes,” (Varnes, 1978). Alternatively, a [...] "rockfall is the natural downward motion of a detached block or series of blocks with a small volume involving free falling, bouncing, rolling, and sliding".

50|$|A {{volcanic}} crater is {{a circular}} negative morphology formed after an explosive eruption. The eruption forms breccia with large clasts, called explosion breccia. The DRM-RJ states the crater {{is present in}} a horseshoe-shaped valley situated about 2 kilometers {{to the south of}} the urban zone. Vieira & Klein presented the north-south geologic cross-section of the supposed crater, showing a prominent volcanic cone. However, the topographic map of this area does not exhibit morphologic characteristics. The inner walls of the valley are not <b>sub-vertical,</b> but have a shallow angle of 15 to 20°, comparable to a slope formed by erosion. Klein & Vieira inferred that the supposed crater area might be underlain by volcanic agglomerate, that is, volcanic breccia with large clasts. The rock is trachyte and thus disproves the volcanic crater theory.|$|E
50|$|Extraction of ore to {{the surface}} was done by tunnels above Level 0 and then through several {{vertical}} shaft. With the relocation of production areas to southwest of the plant, {{in order to reduce}} the operational complexity of the various extraction shafts, increase capacity and centralize the extraction with modern means closer to the new center of gravity of the exploration areas, a crushing chamber was installed (530m elevation) and a 17% sloped conveyor belt that transports the crushed ore to several surface storage bins that feeds the plant and allows the necessary flexibility between the mine and the plant. This system, began operation in 1981 and is still in use today. For ore extraction below Level 2 (Level 3) a <b>sub-vertical</b> shaft installed in 1996 (Poço Eng. Cláudio dos Reis) is used, which brings the ore up to level 2 (560m).|$|E
5000|$|The veins {{that present}} a greater {{inclination}} (30º to 40º), found near the greisenized cupola are called [...] "Galo" [...] veins. Usually {{these types of}} veins are also well mineralized. Sometimes they show variable gradients between 1 and 5m and, after dipping these veins return to normal, that is, horizontal.A different and relatively frequent structure in both the Mine {{and the surrounding area}} are quartz structures called [...] "Seixo Bravo". This connotation is mainly due to the hardness it presents and {{to the fact that they}} do not present useful mineralization. These are lenticular, irregular, with <b>sub-vertical</b> inclination, structures whose arrangement is in agreement with the main schistosity and there width can easily reach 3m. It is an exudation quartz, barren, product of segregation and recrystallization of quartz by regional metamorphism. They are prior to mineralized veins and often form 90º angles.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{technique}} conceived and developed in France, which works like the system of isolated drainage wells but overcoming the inconvenience of installing a pump for each well. Once motion is triggered in the siphon tube, without the entry of air into the loop, {{the flow of water}} is uninterrupted. For this reason, the two ends of the siphon tube are submerged in the water of two permanent storage tanks. This drain is created vertically starting from the campaign level but can also be <b>sub-vertical</b> or inclined. The diameter of the well can vary from 100 to 300 mm;. Inside a PVC pipe is placed or a perforated or microperforated steel pipe, filled with draining material. The siphon drain in this way carries off drainage water by gravity without the need for drainage pumps or pipes linking the bottom of each well. This system proves to be economically advantageous and relatively simple to set up, but requires a programme of controls and maintenance.|$|E
50|$|The parish {{is located}} on layers of {{volcanic}} materials {{referred to as the}} Capelo Volcanic Complex. It is a line of volcanic escoria cones of fissural nature lying on a west-northwest-east-southeast orientation consisting of basaltic volcanism of low explosivity. The peninsula shows varying volcanic shapes and products resulting from surtseyan, Hawaiian and strombolian phases of volcanism. It is area of young rock (less than 10.000 years), overlying the older pyroclasts of the Caldeira Formation, and includes two historical eruptions (the 1672 Cabeço do Fogo and 1957 Capelinhos eruptions). This fractural zone is defined by the Capelo Fault, a fracture system of cones and craters displaying right lateral echelon geometry, which extends to Capelinhos volcano in the western tip of Faial. In this particular area, Capelo Fault is expressed by tens of <b>sub-vertical</b> fractures, concentrated in a 250 meter wide zone, cutting through the pyroclastic sequence of a surtseyan cone exposed in a paleo-sea cliff east of Capelinhos volcano. An example of these fractures {{can be found on the}} surface of the Capelinhos volcano; a warm vent on its eastern flank belies the active nature of this volcanism.|$|E
30|$|The {{vertical}} anisotropy is 2 {{orders of}} magnitude or greater (Figure  3) only {{in the case of}} sub-horizontal fractures with a dip of less than 6 °. In the case of <b>sub-vertical</b> fractures (dip greater than 60 °), the vertical permeability is greater than the horizontal permeability. Note that natural fractures in deep granite rocks are mostly <b>sub-vertical,</b> which leads to insignificant anisotropy in vertical direction.|$|E
30|$|Our {{simulations}} for {{the different}} fracture settings demonstrated that the best heat extraction conditions are {{in the case of}} horizontal fractures. Even gently dipping fractures impact the heat extraction in a negative way and make it similar to the worst case of <b>sub-vertical</b> fractures. Because the natural fractures in granite rock are <b>sub-vertical,</b> the extraction of heat with vertical wells will likely be limited.|$|E
40|$|Pervasive {{fracture}} {{networks are}} common in many reservoir-scale carbonate bodies {{even in the absence}} of large deformation and exert a major impact on their mechanical and flow behaviour. The Upper Cretaceous Jandaíra Formation is a few hundred meters thick succession of shallow water carbonates deposited during the early post-rift stage of the Potiguar rift (NE Brazil). The Jandaíra Formation in the present onshore domain experienced 1000 km 2. The carbonates have a gentle, 400 - 500 m. Deformation was accommodated by a dense network of <b>sub-vertical</b> mode I and hybrid fractures associated with <b>sub-vertical</b> stylolites developed in a stress field characterised by a sub-horizontal σ 1 and <b>sub-vertical</b> σ 2. The development of a network of hybrid fractures, rarely reported in the literature, activated the circulation of waters charged in the mountainous region, flowing along the porous Açu sandstone underlying the Jandaíra carbonates and rising to the surface through the fractured carbonates. With persisting subsidence, carbonates reached depths of 800 - 900 m entering a depth interval characterised by a <b>sub-vertical</b> σ 1. At this stage, sub-horizontal stylolites developed liberating calcite which sealed the <b>sub-vertical</b> open fractures transforming them in veins and preventing further flow. During Tertiary exhumation, several of the pre-existing veins and stylolites opened and became longer, and new fractures were created typically with the same directions of the older features. The simplicity of our model suggests that most rocks in passive margin settings might have followed a similar evolution and thus display similar structures. Basin Research Applied Geolog...|$|E

40|$|Structural {{elements}} of a syn-kinematic pluton in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia reflect evolving rheology during progressive crystallisation, representing a transition from magmatic, through high-temperature sub-solidus to low-temperature deformation. Magmatic elements include: (1) NNE-trending, <b>sub-vertical,</b> kilometre-scale folds (outlined by xenolith trains) that have a magmatic axial planar foliation defined by aligned K-feldspar, (2) cross-cutting, ENE-trending, <b>sub-vertical</b> shear zones intruded by numerous ≤metre-scale granite sheets, and (3) a narrow, concordant magmatic K-feldspar foliation in the granite host-rock adjacent to the shear zones. Microstructures, such as fractured feldspars healed by quartz that is continuous with matrix grains, further suggest that deformation occurred while the pluton was magmatic. High-temperature structural elements include ‘checkerboard’ sub-grain boundaries in quartz, whereas deformation at lower temperatures is indicated by kinked feldspar, recrystallised microcline and undulose quartz. A NNE-trending, <b>sub-vertical</b> sub-solidus foliation, defined by elongate quartz aggregates, overprints all the above mentioned features. Generation of these sequential structural elements correspond to the transition from Newtonian-fluid, through Bingham-type, to Newtonian-solid behaviour as the crystal fraction of the felsic magma increased. The orientation of the structures {{is consistent with a}} regional ESE–WNW shortening direction throughout magma crystallisation.

40|$|To explore aftershock-triggering {{mechanisms}} for the 2003 Big Bear, California earthquake sequence, we determined differential travel-times and applied the double-difference technique to relocate these events, which formed three clusters.

The other two <b>sub-vertical</b> clusters, located {{at opposite ends of}} the mainshock rupture, are almost perpendicular to the mainshock fault, contradicting the 60 ° separation angle of conjugate faults as predicted from frictional laws. Allowing for a 30 ° uncertainty in the cataloged strike, dip and rake values about 75 % of the aftershocks are strike-slip as determined from first motion and complete waveform moment tensor inversions. We use a mainshock conceptual slip model to derive Coulomb Failure Stress regions, and assess correlations between stress increases and aftershock locations.

40|$|The {{current work}} investigates the {{potential}} of two low-cost off-the-shelf quadcopters for multi-view reconstruction of <b>sub-vertical</b> rock faces. The two platforms used are a DJI Phantom 1 equipped with a Gopro Hero 3 + Black and a DJI Phantom 3 Professional with integrated camera. The study area is a small <b>sub-vertical</b> rock face. Several flights were performed with both cameras set in time-lapse mode. Hence, images were taken automatically but the flights were performed manually as the investigated rock face is very irregular which required manual adjustment of the yaw and roll for optimal coverage. The digital images were processed with commercial SfM software packages. Several processing settings were investigated {{in order to find}} out the one providing the most accurate 3 D reconstruction of the rock face. To this aim, all 3 D models produced with both platforms are compared to a point cloud obtained with a terrestrial laser scanner. Firstly, the difference between the use of coded ground control targets and the use of natural features was studied. Coded targets generally provide the best accuracy, but they need to be placed on the surface, which is not always possible, as <b>sub-vertical</b> rock faces are not easily accessible. Nevertheless, natural features can provide a good alternative if wisely chosen as shown in this work. Secondly, the influence of using fixed interior orientation parameters or self-calibration was investigated. The results show that, {{in the case of the}} used sensors and camera networks, self-calibration provides better results. To support such empirical finding, a numerical investigation using a Monte Carlo simulation was performed...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis work {{combines}} {{structural and}} geochronological data {{to improve our}} understanding of the mechanical behaviour of continental crust involving large amount of magma or partially melted material in an abnormally hot collisional belt. We performed a magnetic and geochronological (U/Pb) study on a huge tonalitic batholith from the Neoproterozoic Araçuaí belt of East Brazil to determine the strain distribution through space and time. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility, combined with rock magnetism investigations, supports that the magnetic fabric is a good proxy of the structural fabric. Field measurements together with the magnetic fabrics highlight the presence in the batholith of four domains characterized by contrasted magmatic flow patterns. The western part is characterized by a gently dipping, orogen-parallel (∼NS) magmatic foliation that bears down-dip lineations, in agreement with westward thrusting onto the São Francisco craton. Eastward, the magmatic foliation progressively turns <b>sub-vertical</b> with a lineation that flips from sub-horizontal to <b>sub-vertical</b> over short distances. This latter domain involves an elongated corridor in which the magmatic foliation is sub-horizontal and bears an orogen-parallel lineation. Finally the fourth, narrow domain displays sub-horizontal lineations on a <b>sub-vertical</b> magmatic foliation oblique (∼N 150 °E) to the trend of the belt. U/Pb dating of zircons from the various domains revealed homogeneity in age for all samples. This, together with the lack of solid-state deformation suggests that: 1) the whole batholith emplaced during a magmatic event at ∼ 580 Ma, 2) the deformation occurred before complete solidification, and 3) the various fabrics are roughly contemporaneous. The complex structural pattern mapped in the studied tonalitic batholith suggests a 3 D deformation of a slowly cooling, large magmatic body and its country rock. We suggest that the development of the observed 3 D flow field was promoted by the low viscosity of the middle crust that turned gravitational force as an active tectonic force combining with the East-West convergence between the São Francisco and Congo cratons...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe present new {{analytical}} {{solutions for}} examining the influence, during a pumping test in a well, of an infinite linear and anisotropic strip-aquifer that drains shallow aquifers of different diffusivity and thickness. The whole system is confined and the aquifer geometry {{can be represented}} by a 'T', an aquifer geometry resembling a <b>sub-vertical</b> fault or a <b>sub-vertical</b> vein cross-cutting shallower aquifers. The proposed solutions are based upon an unconventional application of well-image theory, without limitation of the diffusivity contrast between the three domains. Solutions for drawdown were developed for the three domains, i. e. the strip-aquifer and the two shallow compartments, and flow signatures are discussed in detail and compared to numerical modelling. The proposed solutions are not shown to be exact solutions to the appropriate partial differential equation, but very good and useful approximations. The solutions were applied to a 63 -day pumping test in a steep fault zone in crystalline aquifer rock of Brittany, France. After that, the flow contributions of the fault zone and of the shallow aquifers deduced from groundwater dating were compared to analytical solutions. The solutions and theoretical type-curve examples can help in understanding flow processes from tests conducted in settings {{that are similar to}} such a conceptual model...|$|E
40|$|Although {{orogenesis}} commonly lasts 100 million years, {{a maximum}} of three foliations are usually preserved within any outcrop. They record little of the total history due {{to the effects of}} preferential partitioning of progressive shearing along S 0. Such reactivation eventually destroys or rotates multiple successive foliations into parallelism with any layering that is present. Plate motion subjects a collisional orogen to spatially partitioned, episodic, but non-stop deformation. The bulk forces operating are horizontal and intermittently vertical (associated with gravitational load due to crustal thickening) forming <b>sub-vertical</b> and sub-horizontal foliations. These orientations are preserved in the strain shadows of anything competent that hinders reactivation of the compositional layering. Deformation partitioning results in portions of rock remaining unaffected for many events. Gravitational collapse of over-thickened orogen cores leads to significant extrusion in orogen rims and a dominance of sub-horizontal foliations in the latter and episodically continues throughout orogenesis. Reactivation causes decrenulation and/or rotation of foliations into parallelism with S 0, destroying evidence that multiple <b>sub-vertical</b> and sub-horizontal foliations have developed except where preserved as inclusion trails in porphyroblasts and multiply truncated foliations in mylonites. However, the same processes operate in both the cores of orogens and ductile portions of their margins...|$|E
