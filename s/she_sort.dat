Venus tears her clothes and bashes her head into the ground, and mocks her for conceiving {{a child in a}} sham marriage.

But when Venus withdraws to attend a wedding feast, a kind ant takes pity on Psyche, and assembles a fleet of insects to accomplish the task.

2500|$|Because {{the films}} {{were being made}} as the novels were being published, the filmmakers {{had no idea of}} the story's outcome until the release of the final novel in 2007. Kloves spoke of his {{relationship}} with Rowling when adapting the novels by saying, [...] "The thing is about Jo, which is remarkable for someone who had no experience with the filmmaking process, was her intuition. We had a conversation the very first day I met her where she said, 'I know the movies can't be the books... because I know what's coming and it's impossible to fully dramatise on screen what I'm going to write. But I just ask you to be true to the characters; that's all I care about.'"

Then in a hoarse voice, mangling the language, she began warbling a sentimental Russian song, [...] "Ptichka Kanareyka", dearest little canary, about a young man who sends out a canary with a greeting for his beloved. The old beggar woman's screechy voice and outlandish appearance made a terrible impression on me. I gave her some coins and tried to hurry off.
