40|$|The {{entry of}} {{antibiotics}} into phagocytes {{is necessary for}} activity against intracellular pathogens. The ability of <b>sanfetrinem,</b> {{the first member of}} a new class of antibiotics, to penetrate human polymorphonuclear granulocytes and its consequences upon subsequent phagocytosis and killing of ingested penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae have been evaluated. <b>Sanfetrinem</b> penetrated into human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) at all concentrations tested, with cellular concentration/extracellular concentration ratios of 6. 6 to 5. 03 and 4. 21 when <b>sanfetrinem</b> was used at 0. 25 to 0. 5 and 1 μg/ml, respectively, within 30 min of incubation. The uptake was complete within 5 min and was not energy dependent, since it was not affected by cell viability, environmental temperature, or the addition of a metabolic inhibitor. At a concentration of one-half the MIC, <b>sanfetrinem</b> significantly enhanced human PMN phagocytosis and increased intracellular bactericidal activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae. Following preexposure of PMNs to a concentration of one-half the MIC of <b>sanfetrinem,</b> there was a significant increase in both phagocytosis and killing compared with that for the controls, indicating the ability of <b>sanfetrinem</b> to interact with biological membranes and remain active within PMNs. Preexposure of streptococci to <b>sanfetrinem</b> made penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae more susceptible to the bactericidal mechanisms of human PMNs than untreated organisms...|$|E

Previous reports have demonstrated that san-fetrinem has high stability to many b-lactamases and to human renal dehydropeptidase I and has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) (2, 8 – 10, 13). In this study, we evaluated the in vivo activities of san-fetrinem cilexetil and compared them with those of cefdinir and amoxicillin. <b>Sanfetrinem</b> cilexetil and <b>sanfetrinem</b> were supplied by Glaxo Wellcome SpA (Verona, Italy).

40|$|<b>Sanfetrinem</b> is a trinem β-lactam {{which can}} be {{administered}} orally as a hexatil ester. We examined whether its β-lactamase interactions resembled those of the available carbapenems, i. e., stable to AmpC and extended-spectrum β-lactamases but labile to class B and functional group 2 f enzymes. The comparator drugs were imipenem, oral cephalosporins, and amoxicillin. MICs were determined for β-lactamase expression variants, and hydrolysis was examined directly with representative enzymes. <b>Sanfetrinem</b> was a weak inducer of AmpC β-lactamases below the MIC and had slight lability, with a kcat of 0. 00033 s− 1 for the Enterobacter cloacae enzyme. Its MICs for AmpC-derepressed E. cloacae and Citrobacter freundii were 4 to 8 μg/ml, compared with MICs of 0. 12 to 2 μg/ml for AmpC-inducible and -basal strains; MICs for AmpC-derepressed Serratia marcescens and Morganella morganii were not raised. Cefixime and cefpodoxime were more labile than <b>sanfetrinem</b> to the E. cloacae AmpC enzyme, and AmpC-derepressed mutants showed much greater resistance; imipenem was more stable and retained full activity against derepressed mutants. Like imipenem, <b>sanfetrinem</b> was stable to TEM- 1 and TEM- 10 enzymes and retained full activity against isolates and transconjugants with various extended-spectrum TEM and SHV enzymes, whereas these organisms were resistant to cefixime and cefpodoxime. <b>Sanfetrinem,</b> like imipenem and cefixime but unlike cefpodoxime, also retained activity against Proteus vulgaris and Klebsiella oxytoca strains that hyperproduced potent chromosomal class A β-lactamases. Functional group 2 f enzymes, including Sme- 1, NMC-A, and an unnamed enzyme from Acinetobacter spp., increased the <b>sanfetrinem</b> MICs by up to 64 -fold. These enzymes also compromised the activities of imipenem and amoxicillin but not those of the cephalosporins. The hydrolysis of <b>sanfetrinem</b> was examined with a purified Sme- 1 enzyme, and biphasic kinetics were found. Finally, zinc β-lactamases, including IMP- 1 and the L 1 enzyme of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, conferred resistance to <b>sanfetrinem</b> and all other β-lactams tested, and hydrolysis was confirmed with the IMP- 1 enzyme. We conclude that <b>sanfetrinem</b> has β-lactamase interactions {{similar to those of}} the available carbapenems except that it is a weaker inducer of AmpC types, with some tendency to select derepressed mutants, unlike imipenem and meropenem...|$|E
40|$|The trinem <b>sanfetrinem</b> (GV 104326) was {{administered}} as the oral hexetil prodrug GV 118819 X in two dose levels to six healthy volunteers. A single dose equivalent to 125 mg of <b>sanfetrinem</b> {{was administered}}, followed 6 weeks later {{by a single}} dose equivalent to 500 mg of <b>sanfetrinem.</b> The concentrations of the drug in plasma, cantharidin-induced inflammatory fluid, and urine were measured with a microbiological assay. The stability of <b>sanfetrinem</b> was studied in serum and inflammatory fluid. The mean peak concentrations in plasma of 0. 77 and 2. 47 microg/ml were attained at 1. 1 and 2. 0 h after the 125 - and 500 -mg doses, respectively. Mean peak concentrations in inflammatory exudate of 0. 26 and 0. 86 microg/ml were attained at 2. 80 and 2. 67 h after the 125 - and 500 -mg doses, respectively. The mean terminal elimination half-lives in plasma were 1. 33 and 1. 97 h for the 125 - and 500 -mg doses, respectively. The half-lives in the inflammatory fluid were 1. 66 and 1. 74 h for the 125 - and 500 -mg doses, respectively. The overall penetration of the drug into the inflammatory fluid was 51. 4 and 47. 0 % for the 125 - and 500 -mg doses, respectively. Mean urine recovery was greater following 500 mg (24. 15 %) than after 125 mg (18. 4 %) of <b>sanfetrinem.</b> <b>Sanfetrinem</b> was relatively unstable in the inflammatory exudate in vitro (half-life, 5. 5 h), and this could explain the poor penetration of the drug in the inflammatory exudate observed in this study...|$|E

40|$|The postantibiotic effect (PAE) and postantibiotic sub-MIC effect (PAE-SME) of <b>sanfetrinem</b> were {{compared}} to those of penicillin G, amoxicillin, cefpodoxime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, and clarithromycin against four penicillin-susceptible, four intermediately susceptible, and four resistant pneumococci. The MICs of imipenem were the lowest against all of the strains (0. 03 to 0. 5 microg/ml), followed by those of <b>sanfetrinem</b> (0. 016 to 1. 0 microg/ml), amoxicillin and ceftriaxone (0. 016 to 2. 0 microg/ml), and cefpodoxime (0. 03 to 8. 0 microg/ml). High-level resistance to clarithromycin (MIC, > 64. 0 microg/ml) was seen in three selected strains. The PAEs {{of all of the}} oral beta-lactams tested were similar for all of the strains, ranging from 1 to 6. 5 h. The PAEs of ceftriaxone and imipenem ranged from 1 to 8 h, and those of clarithromycin ranged from 1 to 7 h. The mean PAEs of all of the beta-lactams and clarithromycin were 2. 8 to 4. 3 and 2. 5 h, respectively. PAE-SMEs could not be determined for all of the strains due to complete killing, especially at high subinhibitory concentrations. However, the overall pattern with all of the compounds tested was that PAE-SMEs were longer than PAEs. Measurable PAE-SMEs of <b>sanfetrinem</b> at the three subinhibitory concentrations (0. 125, 0. 25, and 0. 5 times the MIC) were 2 to 7, 2 to 7, and 3 to 6 h, while those of amoxicillin and cefpodoxime were 1 to 7. 5, 2 to 4, and 4 to 9 and 2 to 7, 4 to 7, and 4 to 6 h, respectively. Measurable PAE-SMEs of ceftriaxone and imipenem were 1 to 6. 5, 2 to 9, and 2 to 9 and 1. 5 to 6, 2 to 5. 8, and 4 to 7. 7 h, respectively. Measurable clarithromycin PAE-SMEs were 1 to 5, 1 to 5, and 1 to 6 h at the three concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Agar {{dilution}} MIC methodology {{was used}} to test the activities of GV 118819 X (<b>sanfetrinem),</b> ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefpodoxime, loracarbef, levofloxacin, clarithromycin, ceftriaxone, imipenem, and vancomycin against 53 penicillin-susceptible, 84 penicillin-intermediate and 74 penicillin-resistant pneumococci isolated in the United States. GV 118819 X was the most active oral beta-lactam, with MIC at which 50 % of the isolates were inhibited (MIC 50) /MIC 90 values of 0. 008 / 0. 03, 0. 06 / 0. 5, and 0. 5 / 1. 0 micrograms/ml against penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate, and -resistant stains, respectively. Amoxicillin and amoxicillin in the presence of clavulanate (2 : 1) were the second most-active oral beta-lactams, followed by ampicillin and cefpodoxime; loracarbef was not active against penicillin-intermediate and -resistant strains. Clarithromycin was most active against penicillin-susceptible strains but was less active against intermediate and resistant stains. All pneumococcal stains were inhibited by ceftriaxone and imipenem at MICs of < or = 4. 0 and < or = 1. 0 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activities of levofloxacin and vancomycin were unaffected by penicillin susceptibility. Time-kill studies of three penicillin-susceptible, three penicillin-intermediate, and three penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed that all compounds, at the broth microdilution MIC, yielded 99. 9 % killing of all strains after 24 h. Kinetic patterns of all oral beta-lactams, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin were similar relative to the MIC, with 90 % killing of all strains first observed after 12 h. However, killing by amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and levofloxacin was slightly faster and that by clarithromycin was slower than that by the above-described drugs. At 2 x the MIC, more strains were killed earlier than was the case at the MIC, but the pattern seen at the MIC prevailed. When MICs and kill kinetics were combined, <b>sanfetrinem</b> was the most active oral antipneumococcal agent in this study...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} demonstrated that some antimicrobial agents enhance activities of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). The effect on the release of cytokines in an inflammatory context from PMNs by these antibiotics was evaluated. We studied {{the effect of the}} release of some cytokines by human PMNs RT-PCR analysis on a clinical strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae by comparing the effect with that observed in the presence of co-amoxiclav, <b>sanfetrinem,</b> clarithromycin, prulifloxacin and tobramycin. All the drugs tested were capable of modulating PMN synthesis in vitro of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 8, IL- 1 β, TNF-α and IL- 6, but not that of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10. The degree of their stimulatory or inhibitory potency varied with the cytokine examined. © 2003 Elsevier B. V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of the trinem <b>sanfetrinem</b> (formerly GV 104326) (GV) was {{compared with that of}} vancomycin, ampicillin, and/or nafcillin against 287 gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multiresistant enterococci, by the agar and microbroth dilution methods. GV demonstrated 2 to 16 times more activity than ampicillin and nafcillin against the majority of these organisms. The MIC range of GV was 16 to 64 micrograms/ml for 19 Enterococcus faecium strains that were highly resistant to ampicillin (ampicillin MIC range, 64 to 512 micrograms/ml) and vancomycin resistant and 0. 25 to 32 micrograms/ml for resistant Rhodococcus spp. Similar activities (+/- 1 dilution) were observed by either the agar or the broth microdilution method. GV demonstrated bactericidal activity against a beta-lactamase-producing Enterococcus faecalis strain and against two methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains in 10 (5) -CFU/ml inocula. Synergy between GV and gentamicin was observed against an E. faecalis strain that lacked high-level gentamicin resistance. The activity of GV suggests this compound warrants further study...|$|E
