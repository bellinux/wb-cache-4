500|$|In 1957 he {{was passed}} over for the {{captaincy}} and was named as the deputy of Ian Craig, who had played just six matches, as Australia sought to rebuild the team with a youth policy following {{a decline in the}} team. Craig later offered to demote himself due to poor form, but Harvey prevented him from doing so. Craig fell ill the following season, but Harvey moved interstate and Richie Benaud was promoted to the captaincy ahead of him. Harvey continued in the deputy's role until the end of his career, and was captain for only one Test match. In the Second Test at Lord's in 1961, when Benaud was injured, Harvey led the team in the [...] "Battle of the Ridge" [...] on an erratic <b>surface,</b> <b>grinding</b> out a hard fought victory. Only Bradman had scored more runs and centuries for Australia at the time of Harvey's retirement. Harvey was best known for his extravagant footwork and flamboyant stroke play, as well as his fielding. Harvey was particularly known for his innings in conditions unfavourable to batting, performing when his colleagues struggled, such as his 151 not out in Durban, his 92 not out in Sydney in 1954–55 and his 96 on the matting in Dhaka. In retirement, he became a national selector for twelve years but in recent times {{is best known for his}} strident criticism of modern cricket. In 2000, he was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in and selected in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century. In 2009, Harvey was one of the 55 inaugural inductees into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.|$|E
