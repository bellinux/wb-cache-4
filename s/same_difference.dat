500|$|... "When You Believe" [...] was {{recorded}} by The X Factor winner Leon Jackson in December 2007. The single {{was available to}} download from midnight after {{the result of the}} show on December 15, 2007, and a CD was rush-released mid-week, on December 19, 2007. This was unusual as most new singles were released on a Monday to gain maximum sales for the UK Singles Chart the following Sunday. Exceptions included the previous two X Factor winners whose were singles released in this fashion, {{in order for them to}} compete to be the Christmas number-one single, which they all became. A video for the single was made by each of the final four of the series; Jackson, Rhydian Roberts, <b>Same</b> <b>Difference</b> and Niki Evans. However, only the winner's version of the song and video was released.|$|E
500|$|Sounds {{as part of}} a {{linguistic}} system are called phonemes. Phonemes are abstract units of sound, defined as the smallest units in a language that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different words, a so-called minimal pair. In English, for example, the words bat [...] and pat [...] form a minimal pair, in which the distinction between [...] and [...] differentiates the two words, which have different meanings. However, each language contrasts sounds in different ways. For example, in a language that does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants, the sounds [...] and [...] (if they both occur) could be considered a single phoneme, and consequently, the two pronunciations would have the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically between aspirated and non-aspirated pronunciations of consonants, as many other languages like Korean and Hindi do: the unaspirated [...] in spin [...] and the aspirated [...] in pin [...] are considered to be merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such variants of a single phoneme are called allophones), whereas in Mandarin Chinese, the <b>same</b> <b>difference</b> in pronunciation distinguishes between the words [...] 'crouch' and [...] 'eight' (the accent above the á means that the vowel is pronounced with a high tone).|$|E

500|$|Smilodon {{was around}} the size of modern big cats, but was more robustly built. It had a reduced lumbar region, high scapula, short tail, and broad limbs with {{relatively}} short feet. Smilodon is most famous for its relatively long canine teeth, which are the longest found in the saber-toothed cats, at about [...] long in the largest species, S. populator. The canines were slender and had fine serrations {{on the front and}} back side. The skull was robustly proportioned and the muzzle was short and broad. The cheek bones (zygomata) were deep and widely arched, the sagittal crest was prominent, and the frontal region was slightly convex. The mandible had a flange {{on each side of the}} front. The upper incisors were large, sharp, and slanted forwards. There was a diastema (gap) between the incisors and molars of the mandible. The lower incisors were broad, recurved, and placed in a straight line across. The p3 premolar tooth of the mandible was present in most early specimens, but lost in later specimens; it was only present in 6% of the La Brea sample. There is some dispute over whether Smilodon was sexually dimorphic. Some studies of S. fatalis fossils have found little difference between the sexes. Conversely, a 2012 study found that, while fossils of S. fatalis show less variation in size among individuals than modern Panthera, they do appear to show the <b>same</b> <b>difference</b> between the sexes in some traits.|$|E
500|$|Even {{with the}} {{hardware}} designed, Vicarious Visions spent additional time refining the game play. According to lead designer Jeremy Russo, {{the team had}} {{the largest number of}} playtesters brought in for any Vicarious Vision project in order to refine the touchscreen [...] "strumming" [...] action, using a range of testers, including those that had never played a Guitar Hero game, the [...] "'DragonForce' Expert" [...] players, and real guitar players. In addition, the team wanted to expand the [...] "Guitar Duel" [...] mode to include several DS-specific mini-games that could not be recreated on other consoles, but found themselves running out of time. [...] RedOctane wanted to see On Tour as a [...] "polished AAA title on a handheld" [...] and insisted that the [...] "Guitar Duel" [...] be a key feature of the game, giving Vicarious Visions more time to complete the game. The additional time allowed the team to develop the software to recognize every type of strumming approach, including finding a solution to handle the expert players that strummed faster than could be previously recognized. This time also was used to strengthen the [...] "Guitar Duel" [...] gameplay, and as a result, this mode became the testers' favorite feature of the game. While some tracks were brought over from Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, Vicarious Visions recreated all the note tracks for the game, aiming to keep the <b>same</b> <b>difference</b> in difficulty from Easy to Expert as in the console versions. Each song has been divided into three separate compressed tracks that play back simultaneously during gameplay. Vicarious Visions developed a method to overcome the 2,000-polygon drawing limit imposed by the Nintendo DS hardware in order to allow the characters, each composed of about 2,000 polygons, to be recognizable.|$|E

60|$|As {{with plants}} {{of the same}} species and parentage, some {{individuals}} are self-sterile and others self-fertile, of which fact Reseda odorata offers the most striking instances, {{it is not at all}} surprising that species of the same genus differ in this same manner. Thus Verbascum phoeniceum and nigrum are self-sterile, whilst V. thapsus and lychnitis are quite self-fertile, as I know by trial. There is the <b>same</b> <b>difference</b> between some of the species of Papaver, Corydalis, and of other genera.
