40|$|This article investigates how {{a change}} in minimum nurse <b>staffing</b> {{regulation}} for California skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) affects nurse employment and how induced changes in nurse <b>staffing</b> affect patient mortality. In 2000, legislation increased the minimum nurse <b>staffing</b> standard and altered the calculation of nurse <b>staffing,</b> which created incentives to shift employment to lower skilled nurse labor. SNFs constrained by the new regulation increase absolute and relative hours worked by the lowest skilled type of nurse.
