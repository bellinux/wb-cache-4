500|$|... "Ali's Smile" [...] by William Burroughs is a {{short story}} {{originally}} published by Unicorn in 1971 and later republished in Burroughs's collection of short stories, Exterminator! (1973). At {{the opening of the}} story, Clinch Smith, a former colonial official, is living in an English town overshadowed by a giant <b>slag</b> <b>heap.</b> He is upset when he receives a letter from a Scientologist friend saying that he will [...] "disconnect" [...] from Smith, describing him as a [...] "suppressive person". A kris hanging on the wall of his room reminds Smith of Ali, whom he had met 30 years ago in Malaya. Ali had been put under a latah spell by an old woman, forcing him to dance in the marketplace. Smith rescued Ali, making the young man his houseboy. Ali returned to the market, however, and ran amok, killing several of the women with the kris. Smith was forced to shoot Ali, and kept the kris as a souvenir. Back in the present, Smith feels compelled to take the kris from the wall and goes to town, where there is a fight going on between hippies and locals, with members of Scientology's Sea Org in the crowd as well. Smith goes on a killing spree with the kris, which seems to have a life of its own. He stabs Lord Westfield, a Home Office official who has asked a private investigator to infiltrate a Scientology organization, a woman, and several Sea Org members, and then a bystander shoots him dead. Police and more combatants prepare to join the fight. As they do so, the <b>slag</b> <b>heap</b> collapses and buries everyone. At the end, the [...] "ghost face" [...] of Ali smiles over all.|$|E

2500|$|The Hohenzollern Redoubt was a German {{defensive}} {{position on}} the Western Front during the First World War. The redoubt was north of Loos-en-Gohelle (Loos), a mining town north-west of Lens in France. The redoubt was fought over by the British and German armies from the Battle of Loos [...] {{to the beginning of}} the Battle of the Somme on 1 July 1916. Over the winter of 1915–1916, the 170th Tunnelling Company RE dug several galleries under the German lines in the Hohenzollern Redoubt area, which had changed hands several times since September 1915. In March 1916, the west side was held by the British and the east side was occupied by the Germans, with the front near a new German trench known as The Chord. The Germans had an unobstructed view of the British positions, from a <b>slag</b> <b>heap</b> called [...] and in previous mining operations no man's land had become a crater field.

2500|$|Home Park was {{originally}} {{used by the}} now defunct Devonport Albion rugby team from 1893 to 1898. Following a dispute with the ground's owners over rent, Albion left and the ground was not used for three years. In 1901 the Argyle Athletic Club obtained a lease on the ground, then an oval-shaped bowl and cinder track surrounded by allotments and farmland. The new owners staged their first event, an athletics meeting, on Whit Monday in 1901, however, leaseholder Clarence Spooner was keen for it to stage football. Following a series of successful trial matches involving Argyle Football Club, which attracted healthy crowds, Spooner {{made the decision to}} focus on establishing the first professional football club in Devon. The club, formed in 1886, changed its name to Plymouth Argyle in 1903 and became professional that same year. Home Park played host to its first competitive match, against Northampton Town, on 5 September 1903 in front of a crowd of 4,438. At the time the ground had one wooden grandstand which could accommodate 2,000 people, while the other three sides of the ground were surrounded by <b>slag</b> <b>heap</b> banking with a waist-high fence.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a multifaceted {{approach to the}} investigation of iron <b>slag</b> <b>heaps,</b> focusing {{on one of the}} <b>slag</b> <b>heaps</b> at the Royal City of Meroe in Sudan. This study marries together geoprospection data (gradiometry and electrical resistivity transects), topographic data and quantitative excavation data, to provide an analysis and comparison of the total volume, slag component and slag composition of a slag-heap. Significantly, the results demonstrate the limitations of using a topographic only model, but also demonstrate how volumetric modelling must be integrated within quantitative characterisation of slag-heap composition. In this case, quantitative sampling of the slag deposits revealed the composition of the slag assemblage was dominated by a newly defined category of slag which has major implications for reconstructing iron technologies in the Meroitic civilisation. This research highlights the dangers of applying simplistic models and basic investigative strategies to iron <b>slag</b> <b>heaps</b> and furthers the debate on applying volumetric modelling and excavation sampling to unexcavated areas of the finite and important resource of archaeometallurgical deposit sequences...|$|R
