25|$|Hager {{provides}} numerous {{incidents of}} dirty {{politics in the}} book. He describes multiple email exchanges between Cameron Slater and National Party <b>spin</b> <b>doctor</b> Jason Ede who works for Prime Minister John Key. Up till August 2011 Mr Ede was employed by Ministerial Services and, in effect, was paid by the taxpayer. Hager says Ede tried to avoid scrutiny by using a 'dynamic' IP address, one that changed frequently {{making it difficult for}} him to be identified. When the book was published, Mr Ede was employed by the National Party, rather than by John Key, but was still working from the Prime Minister's office. He resigned the day before the election.|$|E

Gayle {{was a former}} employee of Prentiss McCabe and Charles's former girlfriend, {{with whom she had}} a heavily sexual relationship (they often made love whilst listening to classical music). However, the relationship fell apart after Gayle told Charles that she was already married to an insect specialist from Philadelphia. She now runs a rival firm to Prentiss McCabe, which is a much larger company, and is often trying to win Archie's contract, or is the agent of a rival client to Prentiss McCabe's current one. For example, whilst Charles and Martin work for the PM via Archie, Gayle is the <b>spin</b> <b>doctor</b> for the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Prentiss McCabe always {{come up with a plan}} to keep Archie on their side, despite Gayle's attempts to stop them, even trying to make Charles a partner in her firm.|$|E
25|$|Further {{controversy}} erupted {{when two}} days later the tabloid daily, Ekstra Bladet, {{reported that they had}} also been offered the confidential information that was made public during the election campaign. The source of the leak was determined to be Peter Arnfeldt, <b>spin</b> <b>doctor</b> for then Minister for Taxation Troels Lund Poulsen. This led to intense media speculation that the former government, and specifically Troels Lund Poulsen, were engaged in leaking confidential tax information and trying to pressure the revenue service into changing its decision in the case, in an active attempt to discredit the opposition leader in the then imminent election. This would constitute a hitherto unseen level of abuse of power in Danish political life. The commission of inquiry that had already been announced two days previously, was broadly supported by the Danish Parliament to also look into whether the former government was involved in, or knew of, the leak. On the same day Troels Lund Poulsen announced he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence from the Danish Parliament. Peter Arnfeldt has been reported to the police by the Ministry for Taxation. In March 2012 Peter Loft was suspended from his post as deputy chief, {{for the duration of the}} two-year investigation period.|$|E

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is the topic of <b>spin</b> <b>doctoring.</b> We {{understand}} the term of <b>spin</b> <b>doctoring</b> as a one-sided manipulative form of communication whose aim is to influence public opinion and attitudes. The thesis deals with both historic concepts and present day definitions of spin. Based on academic work, this text examines the phenomenon of <b>spin</b> <b>doctoring</b> in relation to political communication, public relations, propaganda, corporate spin and journalistic professions. We elaborate particular techniques and methods of spin on the background of important cases related to <b>spin</b> <b>doctoring.</b> These specific cases refer to anglo-american countries. The field of interest of political communication, the relation of politics and media {{and their impact on}} democratic order of society is examined from the perspective of pluralistic pessimists and neo- liberal optimists. The position of journalists {{in the context of their}} cooperation with the <b>spin</b> <b>doctors</b> is also taken into account. The research part of this work deals with the <b>spin</b> <b>doctoring</b> in the case of "Radar". The aim of the research is to find out whether or not manipulative techniques were employed in order to gain consent and support of the public in the case of building an American radar base in the Czech territory.

His performance in The Deal was acclaimed by Charlie Whelan, Gordon Brown's former <b>spin</b> <b>doctor,</b> and Tim Allan, a deputy press secretary of Tony Blair. A BBC News Online writer praised Morrissey's grasp of Brown's physical tics in a review that criticised the rest of the film. Morrissey's performance won the RTS Programme Award for Best Male Actor the next year, this time beating Nighy. The RTS jury wrote of Morrissey, [...] "The strength of this performance brought to the screen, and to life, all of the characteristics and traits of the man he portrayed {{in a way that was}} both credible and convincing." [...] In 2009, Morrissey declined the opportunity to play Brown again in The Special Relationship, Morgan's third Blair film, as he did not want to get into the mindset of playing Brown for just one scene.|$|E
