For this reason, the 1907 Isle of Man TT Race used the 15 miles, 1,470 yards (25.49 km) St. John's Short Course. The 1906 Isle of Man Tourist Trophy Race for automobiles the Highroad Course was reduced from 52.12 mi to 40 miles, 2 furlongs and 60 yards. For the 1908 Tourist Trophy race for automobiles, the course was again reduced to 37.5 mi with the removal of the Peel and Sandygate loops and was known as the Four Inch Course. The name of the course derives from the regulations for the 1908 Tourist Trophy adopted by the Royal Automobile Club which limited the engines of the competing automobiles to a cylinder diameter of four-inches (102 mm) [...] The Four-Inch Course was adopted by the Auto-Cycle Club for the 1911 Isle of Man TT Races.
