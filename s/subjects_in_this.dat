25|$|Because its {{monopoly}} licence {{granted by}} the British Government forbade any activity besides the fur trade, the HBC created the PSAC to sidestep this issue. The PSAC was formed to produce or manufacture enough agricultural and livestock products to meet the Russian supply demands. In correspondence with British officials, the PSAC was long touted {{as a means to}} promote the British position in the Oregon boundary dispute with the United States. For years now the British had insisted that the Pacific Northwest be partitioned along the Columbia River, rather than a westward extension of the 49th parallel. This would have left most of modern Washington state under British control, notably the important Puget Sound. Through its company stations, the PSAC would promote settlement by British <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> disputed area, although it largely failed in this particular aspect.|$|E

2500|$|Panopticon was an overtly {{political}} release, {{and arguably}} the clearest statement made within their music yet. It displayed fears of surveillance and of tacit governmental influence; its namesake, the panopticon, was Jeremy Bentham's concept for a prison {{system in which}} all the prisoners can be viewed by one guard in a central tower, without being able to know whether they are being observed or not. Bentham described the Panopticon as [...] "a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind, in a quantity hitherto without example." [...] Quizzed on government conspiracies, Turner states: [...] "I do believe that each and every day our government and the huge corporate entities of this country lie to us about numerous <b>subjects.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> respect we are all victims of a huge conspiracy—most of those in power are only concerned with the advancement of their agendas and have no qualms about deceiving and hurting the American people." ...|$|E

2500|$|All {{considered}} it was unsurprising that Sir George was recalled in 1859.

[...] He was still working for this support when, war with the Māori having broken out, it was decided that Grey should again be appointed governor of New Zealand. [...] When he left his popularity among the people of Cape Colony was unbounded, and the statue erected at Cape Town during his lifetime described him as a governor who by his high character as a Christian, a statesman, and a gentleman, had endeared himself to all classes of the community, and who by his zealous devotion to the best interests of South Africa and his able and just administration, has secured the approbation and gratitude of all Her Majesty's <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> part of her dominions.|$|E
