The angles given to rail fins are a compromise generating straight drag and oppositions in maneuvers. The center fin merit {{of being able to}} adjust its <b>suction</b> <b>face</b> and its angle with the direction of the turn to avoid the hydrodynamic stall. The fin camber and attack angle needed to accord to the different phases of trajectory. When turning left or right the fins need to adjust the camber and attack angles to avoid hydrodynamic stall, so the Adaptive Dynamic Attack & Camber system (ADAC) brought a solution to this hydrodynamic problem. This surf fin technology introduced adaptable structures with variable geometry inspired by aeronautics and biomimetic in the surf.|$|E
30|$|Similarly, {{based on}} Table  11, by {{decreasing}} {{the value of}} injection parameter I_ 0 and reducing {{the thickness of the}} sheet β ^ 2, free temperature and skin friction coefficient of suction side are increased, while heat flux is decreased for fixed values of the remaining parameters. Usually, it happens that due to the higher pressure at the injection face, the fluid is forced out through medium, and due to the lower pressure at the <b>suction</b> <b>face,</b> the fluid enters at the discharge side. Excellent agreements are observed between both the techniques, shooting method and HAM, for a variety of physical parameter values as displayed in Table  5.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this article}} is to present {{experimental}} results obtained on a fan composed of a radial impeller matched with a vaned diffuser. There is no volute downstream to the diffuser. Consequently the diffuser outlet is at free air. The particularity of this machinery is that the diffuser design flow rate corresponds to 80 % of the impeller one. Investigations have been made for five different flow rates. Global performances of the machine are evaluated thanks to pressure measurements and averaged velocities obtain with a three holes probe, at nine angular positions at diffuser inlet and outlet just as five radial positions in a middle section of a blade-to-blade passage. In order to better characterize separations observed in previous experimental and numerical studies unsteady pressure measurement campaigns have been carried out. The transducers are located at five positions on the pressure face and four positions on the <b>suction</b> <b>face</b> on diffuser vanes in a blade-to-blade plane. For each position, three transducers are located at three different heights, from hub to shroud. Unsteadinesses revealed by these measurements just as theirs effects on the diffuser performance are analysed...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} performed to understand the development and suppression of the secondary flow structures within a compact, serpentine jet engine inlet duct. By employing a variety of flow diagnostic techniques, {{the formation of a}} pair of counter-rotating vortices was revealed. A modular fluidic actuator system that would apply several different methods of flow control was then designed and manufactured to improve duct performance. At the two bends of the inlet, conformal flow control devices were installed to deliver varying degrees of boundary layer suction, suction and steady fluid injection, and suction and oscillatory injection. Testing showed that suction alone could delay flow separation and improve the pressure recovery of the duct by as much as 70 %. However, this technique was not able to rid the duct completely of the nonuniformities that exist at the engine <b>face</b> plane. <b>Suction</b> with steady blowing, however, increased pressure recovery by 37 % and reduced distortion by 41 % at the engine <b>face.</b> <b>Suction</b> with pulsed injection had the least degree of success in suppressing the secondary flow structures, with improvements in pressure recovery of only 16. 5 % and a detrimental impact on distortion. The potential for gains in the aerodynamic efficiency of serpentine inlets by active flow control was demonstrated in this study...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{propeller}} erosion {{tests have}} been conducted at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division 24 inch variable pressure water tunnel (VPWT), shown in Figure 1, to establish testing procedures for evaluating various coatings to minimize cavitation erosion damage to marine propellers. A severe wake field was produced using a two dimensional, thick foil ahead of a downstream driven propeller model. This approach was derived from similar tests conducted by Miller [11]. Conventional cavitation viewing was performed with cameras viewing through the tunnel side window. Images were acquired using high speed (up to 6000 fps) and high resolution (2 K x 2 K) cameras. In addition, a waterproof camera was mounted inside the foil looking directly downstream at the <b>suction</b> <b>face</b> of the blade. Two propellers were tested, a 16 inch (0. 406 m) diameter propeller 5388 and a 12 inch (0. 305 m) diameter propeller 4119 [8]. The foil wake field was measured with LDV surveys. Accelerometers were mounted in the water tunnel test section to measure acoustic emissions of cavitation activity. Cavitation erosion was observed {{at the tip of}} the 16 inch diameter propeller due to excessive tip vortex, and complicated vortex collapse. Moderate erosion was also observed at the inner radii, where leading edge sheet cavitation collapsed. Scanning techniques for quantifying propeller erosion damage were evaluated. These studies will transition to the 36 -inch VPWT where a number of geosym propellers of different materials and coating will be assessed in a similar wake field...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{measurements}} of the piezometric head from sand flume experiments of an idealised coastal aquifer forced by a simple harmonic boundary condition across a vertical boundary are presented. The measurements focus on the pore pressures {{very close to the}} interface View the MathML source and throw light on the details of the boundary condition, particularly with respect to meniscus <b>suction</b> and seepage <b>face</b> formation during the falling tide. Between the low and the mean water level, the response is consistent with meniscus suction free models in terms of both the vertical mean head and oscillation amplitude profiles and is consistent with the observation that this area of the interface was generally within the seepage face. Above the mean water level, the influence of meniscus formation is significant with the mean pressure head being less than that predicted by capillary free theory and oscillation amplitudes decaying faster than predicted by suction free models. The reduced hydraulic conductivity in this area due to partial drainage of pores on the falling tide also causes a delay in the response to the rising tide. The combined influence of seepage <b>face</b> formation, meniscus <b>suction</b> and reduced hydraulic conductivity generate higher harmonics with amplitudes of up to 26...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{oil and gas}} mining has moved into {{increasingly}} deeper water in search of undeveloped fields. As water depths approach and exceed 3000 m conventional offshore foundation systems become inefficient and ineffective in stabilising platforms and floating production storage units. The trend of supporting structure design in deep water has been to install catenary and taut leg mooring systems. Consequently, many types of anchoring systems are being developed and used in order to withstand large mooring forces. The SEPLA (Suction Embedded Plate Anchor) is ideal for use in this situation. This project has employed advanced numerical techniques and centrifuge testing to study pullout behaviour of plate anchor foundations in different soil profiles and suction caisson installation effect {{with the aim of}} generating a robust framework for design. The behaviour of strip and circular plate anchors during vertical pullout in uniform and normally consolidated clays has been studied by means of small strain and large deformation finite element analyses. Both fully bonded (attached), and ‘vented’ (no <b>suction</b> on rear <b>face),</b> anchors have been considered. The current numerical results were compared with existing laboratory test data, finite element results and analytical solutions. This study showed that the ultimate pullout capacity factors (Nc) for deep embedment were 11. 6 and 11. 7 for smooth and rough strip anchors and 13. 1 and 13. 7 for smooth and rough circular anchors respectively. When the anchor base was vented, the soil stayed attached to the anchor base for deep embedment, and the pullout capacity was therefore the same as for the attached anchor. The separation depth ratio, Hs/B or Hs/D was found to increase linearly with the normalised strength ratio, su/γ'B or su/γ'D. Numerical simulation has been conducted to assess the bearing capacity for inclined pullout plate anchors. This bearing capacity analysis was performed by embedding the anchors in clay with different initial inclinations and different embedment ratios. Both the attached anchor base and vented base were evaluated. The results showed that the bearing capacities of the inclined plate anchors were associated with the inclination angles and base conditions. The separation depth of the plate anchors can be assessed by a simple equation from vertically pulled out plate anchors. Large deformation finite element analyses of plate anchor keying in clay has been performed. The effects of anchor thickness, anchor padeye eccentricity, anchor-soil interface roughness, soil shear strength, anchor submerged weight and soil disturbance have been studied with anchors in uniform or normally consolidated clays. The numerical results were compared with transparent soil test and existing centrifuge test data. The study showed that the RITSS method works well in simulating the anchor keying process. Anchor padeye eccentricity {{played an important role in}} anchor keying. A normalised anchor geometry ratio was used to estimate the loss in embedment during plate anchor’s keying. Both finite element analysis and centrifuge tests have been conducted to study the suction caisson installation effect. In finite element analysis, the soil disturbed zone varied from 3 times the caisson wall thickness to a full area inside a caisson. Centrifuge tests of suction embedded plate anchors were conducted in normally consolidated kaolin clay and transparent uniform soil. It can be concluded that the reduction in anchor capacity due to soil disturbance after suction caisson installation depends on re-consolidation time and soil sensitivity. The soil disturbance also reduced the loss of embedment during the anchor keying process...|$|R
