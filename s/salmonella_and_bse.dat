40|$|Introduction: It {{has been}} {{previously}} reported that the same `prion strain' causes vCJD <b>and</b> <b>BSE</b> [Hill et al. Nature 1997; 389 : 448]. The scrapie isoform of prion protein (PrP) detected in vCJD has a ratio of glycoforms that closely resembles that of BSE passaged in several species [Collinge et al. Nature 1996; 383 : 685]. FVB mice inoculated with vCJD produced mouse PrPSc with vCJD-like glycoform ratios and fragment sizes indistinguishable from those in FVB mice expressing human PrP [Hill et al. Nature 1997; 389 : 448]. Striking similarities have also been noted in the patterns of PrP deposition between <b>BSE</b> <b>and</b> vCJD-inoculated mice. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to assess further the characteristic immunophenotypical patterns of prion deposition associated with transmission of vCJD <b>and</b> <b>BSE</b> to mice. Materials and Methods: Tg 152 mice expressing human PrP alone [HuPrP+/+ Prnp 0 / 0] and wild-type FVB mice were inoculated with 30 ml of a 1 : 10 homogenate of vCJD or BSE-infected CNS material. PBS inoculated animals were used as controls. The brains of these aimals were subsequently screened for deposition of PrP by immunocytochemistry using antibodies 3 F 4, 12 F 10 and sp 40. Results: The pattern of PrP deposition included diffuse, diffuse-punctate, plaque and pericellular deposits associated with transmission to both wild-type and transgenic mice. Specifically, <b>BSE</b> <b>and</b> vCJD markedly up-regulated pericellular reactivity in transgenic animals; a feature not demonstrable in wild-types. The distribution of PrP was similar in vCJD <b>and</b> <b>BSE,</b> primarily targeting deep grey nuclei, midbrain, medulla and cerebellum Conclusion: These results demonstrate that vCJD <b>and</b> <b>BSE</b> display similar neuropathological and immunophenotypical characteristics of transmission...|$|R

30|$|The {{evidence}} supporting {{the value of}} combining CBE <b>and</b> <b>BSE</b> as methods to reduce breast cancer mortality is limited and mostly inferential (Drukteinis et al. 2013). Canadian guidelines recommend against <b>BSE</b> <b>and</b> CBE; (Tonelli et al. 2011) USPSTF recommends against <b>BSE</b> <b>and</b> cites insufficient evidence to recommend CBE; (US Preventive Services Task Force 2009) and ACOG recommends annual CBE to women > 40  years <b>and</b> <b>BSE</b> only for high risk patients (American College of Obstetricians-Gynecologists 2011). Ultrasound is an established adjunct to mammography in imaging evaluation, can be an option for additional screening in women at high risk, similarly in candidates for magnetic resonance imaging (Smith et al. 2003; Henderson et al. 2003). With routinely MS, CBE/BSE may not improve outcome, however, in LDCs, training of BSE by increasing cancer awareness, may also improve early detection. Limited evidence showed that women who had CBE {{were more likely to}} undergo MS in Malaysia, (Dahlui et al. 2012) and ultrasound combined with mammography may result in effective protection for Chinese women based on the younger age at tumor onset (Huang et al. 2001).|$|R

In addition to that prevalence of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>and</b> Mycoplasma infection in MBPFs during rainy and winter seasons were also recorded. The results of serological tests were analyzed statistically. The overall prevalence of <b>Salmonella</b> <b>and</b> Mycoplasma infection in six MBPFs were recorded as 23. 46 % and 46. 88 % respectively.

The objective of our study was to investigate the suitability of molecular strain typing methods as a surveillance tool for studying scrapie strain variations and for differentiating PrP(Sc) from sheep scrapie, <b>BSE,</b> <b>and</b> sheep <b>BSE.</b> We studied 38 Italian sheep scrapie cases from 13 outbreaks, along with a British scrapie case, an experimental ovine <b>BSE,</b> <b>and</b> 3 <b>BSE</b> cases, by analyzing the glycoform patterns and the apparent molecular masses of the nonglycosylated forms of semipurified, proteinase-treated PrP(Sc). Both criteria were able to clearly differentiate sheep scrapie from <b>BSE</b> <b>and</b> ovine experimental <b>BSE.</b> PrP(Sc) from <b>BSE</b> <b>and</b> sheep <b>BSE</b> showed a higher glycoform ratio and a lower molecular mass of the nonglycosylated form compared to scrapie PrP(Sc). Scrapie cases displayed homogeneous PrP(Sc) features regardless of breed, flock, and geographic origin. The glycoform patterns observed varied with the antibody used, but either a monoclonal antibody (MAb) (F 99 / 97. 6. 1) or a polyclonal antibody (P 7 - 7) was able to distinguish scrapie from BSE PrP(Sc). While more extensive surveys are needed to further corroborate these findings, our results suggest that large-scale molecular screening of sheep populations for BSE surveillance may be eventually possible.

This hospital-based study was conducted at the Ocean Road Cancer Institute in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 130 women aged 20 - 69 years without a known history of breast cancer. Demographic data and subjects responses to a questionnaire addressing the knowledge of the women on breast anatomy and physiology; breast cancer causes; symptoms; breast self examination and treatment were recorded. Our results showed that correct scores ranged between 3 % and 95. 5 % with a mean correct score of 36. 1 %. Since the average total correct scores fell below 50 %, one might conclude that subjects possessed little knowledge related to breast cancer <b>and</b> <b>BSE.</b> However a closer look of the results showed that although correct and incorrect responses were dispersed throughout all content areas, the majority (80 - 90 %) of subjects were more likely to correctly answer items assessing symptoms than any other subset of items but had knowledge deficits regarding when to get medical consultation. In this study, only 47 % of subjects knew that they needed to see a doctor when they developed a breast lump.

This study describes and compares antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica (<b>Salmonella)</b> <b>and</b> Escherichia coli recovered from dairy BTM. BTM from more than 400 dairies in a dairy-intense region of California were sampled eight times at 2 - to 3 -month intervals over a 29 -month period. From <b>Salmonella</b> positive <b>and</b> <b>Salmonella</b> negative herds any one <b>Salmonella</b> <b>and</b> three E. coli isolates per sample were tested for susceptibility to 12 antimicrobials. The prevalence of multiple drug resistant (MDR) E. coli was assessed in relation to Salmonella on the farm, farm size, season, MDR <b>Salmonella,</b> <b>and</b> serovar. At each sampling period, 10 - 21 % and 54 - 77 % of the dairy farms were positive for <b>Salmonella</b> <b>and</b> E. coli, respectively. The most commonly recovered Salmonella serovars were Montevideo (33 %), Typhimurium (14 %), Dublin (13 %), and Give (11 %).

Further, to test whether a lack of perceived control over exposure to GM food accounts for the heightened vulnerability it is typically associated with. Two consecutive questionnaires were administered in various regions of the UK. The first asked 200 participants to indicate whether they regarded GM food as a health risk, and to spontaneously identify issues similar to GM food. The second asked a further 200 to rate the similarity between GM food <b>and</b> <b>BSE,</b> <b>Salmonella,</b> <b>and</b> food irradiation, and to give personal and general risk ratings for consuming GM food, and tolerance ratings for its availability and availability if always clearly labelled. The results indicate GM food is overwhelmingly identified as a health risk, <b>and</b> that <b>BSE</b> is widely held to be analogous with GM food. However, BSE was rated as less similar to GM food than food irradiation. The widespread identification of BSE as an analogue is explained in terms of it representing a worst-case scenario. The risk ratings are consistent with the heightened sense of vulnerability associated with GM food; the tolerance ratings are greater for the availability of GM food if always clearly labelled, indicating a perceived lack of control over exposure to GM food accounts, in part, for GM food risk perceptions. However, the results also indicate that, in terms of practical risk management, labelling may only be effective with respect to a younger age group. ...|$|R
