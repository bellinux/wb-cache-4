50|$|The dune soil is {{calcareous}} {{because of}} the high percentage of seashell fragments which leads to a flora with lime-loving plants that are otherwise rare in Cornwall. The flora also includes at least sixty-six species of moss, making it one of richest sites in Cornwall. A number of rare plant species have been recorded on the site, these include Babington's leek (Allium babingtonii), brackish water buttercup (Ranunculus baudotii), Cornish gentian (Gentianella anglica subsp. cornubiensis), fragrant evening-primrose (Oenothera stricta), Italian lords-and-ladies (Arum italicum), Portland spurge (Euphorbia portlandica), shore-dock (Rumex rupestris), <b>slender</b> spike <b>rush</b> (Eleocharis acicularis), variegated horsetail (Equisetum variegatum) and wild leek (Allium ampeloprasum). Due to its importance as a site for lichens and rare plant species, Plantlife has designated the dunes an Important Plant Area.|$|R

50|$|Gero Island {{is a large}} island on Chesuncook Lake in Piscataquis County, Maine. The {{island is}} 3175 acre in area, with all but 133 acre regulated. It is known for {{exemplary}} natural communities of <b>slender</b> <b>rush</b> as well as white pine forest and lower elevation spruce-fir forest. Chesuncook Lake was created by damming the West Branch Penobscot River in the 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Slender</b> <b>rush</b> {{grows in}} landscapes, crops, roadsides, and {{all types of}} fields. It can grow on both wet and dry sites, in soils {{consisting}} mainly of sand or clay. Because of its high tolerance of compacted soils, it can outcompete other plant species in such places, hence the name [...] "path rush". It is native throughout all fifty states of United States, most of Canada, and parts of northern Europe.|$|E
60|$|The Estremedura's whistle hooted just then, and as Jacinta looked round a lordly four-masted ship, {{carrying}} {{everything to}} her royals, swept {{up out of}} the night. She was driving down the trade-breeze a good twelve knots an hour, and the foam flew up in cascades as her bows went down, swirled in a broad, snowy smother along the <b>slender</b> streak of <b>rushing</b> hull. Above it four tapered spires of sailcloth swung back against the moonlight at every stately roll, and she showed as an exquisite cameo cut in ebony on a ground of silver and blue. Still, it was not the colour that formed the strength of that picture, but the suggestion of effort and irresistible force that was stamped on it. She drove by majestically, showing a breadth of wet plates that flashed in a leeward roll, and Jacinta's eyes rested on the bent figure high on the lifted poop grappling with her wheel.|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile, we hear {{little of}} the North. The almost utter {{destruction}} of its records during the heathen domination restricts us for information to the West Saxon chronicles; and they have little {{to tell us about}} any but their own affairs. In 866, however, we learn that there came a great heathen host to East Anglia–an organised expedition under two chieftains–"and took winter quarters there, and were horsed; and the East Anglians made peace with them." [...] Next year, this permanent host sailed northward to Humber, and attacked York. The Northumbrians, as usual, were at strife among themselves, two rival kings fighting for the supremacy. The burghers of York admitted the heathen host within the walls. Then the rival kings fell upon the town, broke the <b>slender</b> fortifications, and <b>rushed</b> into the city. The Danes attacked them both, and defeated them with great slaughter. Northumbria passed at once into the power of the heathen. Their chiefs, Ingvar and Ubba, erected Deira into a new Danish kingdom, leaving Bernicia to an English puppet; and Northumbria ceases to exist for the present as a factor in Anglo-Saxon history. We must hand it over for sixty years to the Scandinavian division of this series.|$|R

40|$|General Description: Low, erect {{perennial}} {{with leaves}} ranging from 4 to 12 inches long. Mature plants have 2 to 6 leaves. The plant is glabrous, or smooth, without hairs, and is rarely greater than 16 inches tall. It is taprooted, with the caudex usually located about 1 to 2 inches below the ground surface. Its yellow flowers {{are small and}} compact. Inflorescences have from 5 to 14 umbellets. Fruits are oblong, to inch long, with thickened outer margins known as wings. Identification Tips: Lomatium bradshawii is most easily identified by the involucels (small bracts beneath the inflorescence) that are 3 cleft to the middle with the lobes often cleft again and by the corky-thickened wings on the fruit. L. utriculatum, which occurs {{within the range of}} L. bradshawii, has shallowly cleft involucels and thin winged fruit. Lomatium bradshawii appears to be most closely related to Lomatium cookii of the Rogue River and Illinois River valleys in southwestern Oregon. Phenology: The peak blooming period occurs from the last week of April through the first week of May, with few plants still blooming in early June. Fruit is present on plants from mid-May to early July, and is shed at maturity. Range: Endemic to the southern portion of western Washington in the Puget Trough physiographic province and to the central and southern portions of the Willamette Valley physiographic province in western Oregon. Habitat: The species occurs in remnant fragments of the once widespread low elevation grasslands and prairies. The habitat type is described as wet, seasonally flooded prairies and grasslands common around creeks and small rivers. Associated species include tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia cespitosa), <b>slender</b> <b>rush</b> (Juncus tenuis), sawbeak sedge (Carex stipata), and one-sided sedge (Carex unilateralis) ...|$|E
40|$|The dual {{character}} of Loch Lomond, its {{size as the}} largest area of fresh water in Great Britain and its diverse communities of plants and animals, make it of major importance locally, nationally and internationally and it will undoubtedly be the 'Jewel in the Crown' of the proposed Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park. The greatly contrasting bathymetry, with a long narrow deep northern trough and a broad shallow southern basin, is unique for any lake in Europe. This division, by the Highland Boundary Fault, is reflected also in the catchment and in {{the flora and fauna}} of the loch. Among the flora are found notable species such as the Scottish Dock (Fig. 1), <b>Slender</b> <b>Rush,</b> Elongated Sedge and two species of Waterworts. Rare invertebrates also occur in Loch Lomond: the worm Arcteonais lomondi was new to science when it was discovered there and named accordingly. Nineteen species of fish occur in Loch Lomond — the largest number in any Scottish loch. Fifteen are native and four introduced. Two are of particular importance -Powan (Fig. 2) and an unusual local race of River Lamprey. Other aquatic vertebrates of significance are the Greenland White-fronted Goose and the Otter. Within the Loch Lomond catchment there is a great variety of aquatic habitats that make a substantial contribution to the diversity and importance of the natural heritage of the area. Notable among these waters is the River Endrick. The importance of the loch itself has been recognised by the creation of the Loch Lomond National Nature Reserve, which itself was designated in 1976 as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. In spite of this, the loch's high amenity value — to tourists and for recreational purposes, as a fishery and a source of water supply — poses various threats and those with interests in tourism, camping, boat hire, cabin cruising, power boating, water skiing, canoeing, bathing, picnicking, natural history, angling, research, conservation and water supply are likely to be involved in conflicts of interests. Of particular concern are the number of alien plants and animals which have been introduced to the area; some of these are now well established. The problems concerned are likely to be resolved successfully only if some form of co-ordinated programme involving the integration of conservation and multi-purpose usage is developed for the loch and its catchment. Such a programme and its relevant monitoring must {{be one of the first}} tasks of the new National Park Authority...|$|E
