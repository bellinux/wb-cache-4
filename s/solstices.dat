5|$|Because Ariel, like Uranus, orbits the Sun {{almost on}} its side {{relative}} to its rotation, its northern and southern hemispheres face either directly towards or directly away from the Sun at the <b>solstices.</b> This means it is subject to an extreme seasonal cycle; just as Earth's poles see permanent night or daylight around the <b>solstices,</b> so Ariel's poles see permanent night or daylight for half a Uranian year (42 Earth years), with the Sun rising close to the zenith {{over one of the}} poles at each solstice. The Voyager 2 flyby coincided with the 1986 southern summer solstice, when nearly the entire northern hemisphere was dark. Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an equinox and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth, mutual occultations of Uranus's moons become possible. A number of such events occurred in 2007–2008, including an occultation of Ariel by Umbriel on 19 August 2007.|$|E

50|$|The June <b>solstice,</b> {{also known}} as the {{northern}} <b>solstice,</b> is the <b>solstice</b> on the Earth that occurs each June falling on the 20th to 22nd according to the Gregorian calendar. In the Northern Hemisphere, the June <b>solstice</b> is the summer <b>solstice,</b> whilst in the Southern Hemisphere it is the winter <b>solstice.</b>|$|R
50|$|The December <b>solstice,</b> {{also known}} as the {{southern}} <b>solstice,</b> is the <b>solstice</b> that occurs each December, typically between the 20th and the 22nd day of the month according to the Gregorian calendar. In the southern hemisphere, the December <b>solstice</b> is the summer <b>solstice,</b> whilst in the northern hemisphere it is the winter <b>solstice.</b>|$|R
50|$|The night {{length is}} {{inconsistent}} during a year. It's 60 centiday {{in the winter}} <b>solstice,</b> and 40 centiday in the summer <b>solstice.</b> So the start of night is from 0 to 1 gong. In practice, the start are postponed for 0.5 centiday after each 9 days from the winter <b>solstice</b> to the summer <b>solstice,</b> and moved up for 0.5 centiday after each 9 days from summer <b>solstice</b> to the winter <b>solstice.</b>|$|R
5|$|The exact instants of {{equinoxes}} or <b>solstices</b> are {{the times}} when the apparent ecliptic longitude (including the effects of aberration and nutation) of the Sun is 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°. Because of perturbations of Earth's orbit and peculiarities of the calendar, the dates of these are not fixed.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no clear}} {{evidence}} that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod, Michael Grofe, Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni, have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided. There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on <b>solstices</b> or equinoxes. It is possible that only the earliest among Mesoamericans observed <b>solstices,</b> but {{this is also a}} disputed issue among Mayanists. There is also no evidence that the classic Maya attached any importance to the Milky Way; there is no glyph in their writing system to represent it, and no astronomical or chronological table tied to it.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{northern}} latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 2 minutes of daylight. The difference in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter <b>solstices</b> is 10 hours and 30 minutes.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>solstice</b> {{can also}} be used in a broader sense, as the day when this occurs. The day of the <b>solstice</b> has either the most {{sunlight}} of the year (summer <b>solstice)</b> or the least sunlight of the year (winter <b>solstice)</b> for any place other than the equator. Alternative terms, with no ambiguity as to which hemisphere is the context, are June <b>solstice</b> and December <b>solstice,</b> referring to the months of year in which they take place.|$|R

5|$|Structure 4 (or Structure IV) is a {{group of}} three temples {{on the east side of}} the Central Plaza. It is divided into three sections, {{labelled}} Structures 4a, 4b and 4c. The central Structure 4b is built upon a substructure dating to the Preclassic period. Together with Structure 6 on the opposite side of the plaza, these buildings form an E-Group that may have been used to determine the <b>solstices</b> and the equinoxes.|$|E
5|$|The Maya were keen {{observers}} of the sun, stars, and planets. E-Groups were a particular arrangement of temples that were relatively common in the Maya region; they take their names from Group E at Uaxactun. They consisted of three small structures facing a fourth structure, and were used to mark the <b>solstices</b> and equinoxes. The earliest examples date to the Preclassic period. The Lost World complex at Tikal started out as an E-Group built {{towards the end of}} the Middle Preclassic. Due to its nature, the basic layout of an E-Group was constant. A structure was built on the west side of a plaza; it was usually a radial pyramid with stairways facing the cardinal directions. It faced east across the plaza to three small temples on the far side. From the west pyramid, the sun was seen to rise over these temples on the <b>solstices</b> and equinoxes. E-Groups were raised across the central and southern Maya area for over a millennium; not all were properly aligned as observatories, and their function may have been symbolic.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{core of the}} Mundo Perdido was an E-Group astronomical complex. The east stairway of the Lost World Pyramid (5C-54) was {{the observation}} point and the three original temples on the East Platform (5D-84, 5D-86 and 5D-88) were markers used to plot the sunrise on the equinoxes and the <b>solstices.</b> Over the course of Tikal's history the E-Group underwent seven distinct construction phases, with the earliest dating {{to the end of}} the Middle Preclassic period.|$|E
50|$|The winter <b>solstice</b> (or hibernal <b>solstice),</b> {{also known}} as midwinter, is an astronomical {{phenomenon}} marking the day with the shortest period of daylight and the longest night of the year.In the Northern Hemisphere this is the December <b>solstice</b> and in the Southern Hemisphere this is the June <b>solstice.</b>|$|R
50|$|At this {{latitude}} the sun {{is visible}} for 15 hours, 37 minutes during the summer <b>solstice</b> and 8 hours, 46 minutes during the winter <b>solstice.</b> The midday sun stands 21.6 degrees above the southern horizon at the December <b>solstice,</b> 68.4 degrees at the June <b>solstice,</b> and exactly 45.0 degrees at the two equinoxes.|$|R

5|$|Because of Copenhagen's {{northern}} latitude, {{the number}} of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter <b>solstices.</b>|$|E
5|$|By astronomical convention, {{the four}} seasons can be {{determined}} by the solstices—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the equinoxes, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter solstice currently occurs around 21 December; summer solstice is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter <b>solstices</b> exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.|$|E
5|$|More {{problematic}} {{are those}} {{cases where the}} movement of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with petroglyphs. A widely known example is the Sun Dagger of Fajada Butte at which a glint of sunlight passes over a spiral petroglyph. The location of a dagger of light on the petroglyph varies throughout the year. At the summer solstice a dagger can be seen through the heart of the spiral; at the winter solstice two daggers appear to either side of it. It is proposed that this petroglyph was created to mark these events. Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico. It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the <b>solstices.</b> The Sun Dagger site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, stands out for its explicit light markings that record all the key events of both the solar and lunar cycles: summer solstice, winter solstice, equinox, and the major and minor lunar standstills of the moon’s 18.6 year cycle. In addition at two other sites on Fajada Butte, there are five light markings on petroglyphs recording the summer and winter <b>solstices,</b> equinox and solar noon. Numerous buildings and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon and outlying areas are oriented to the same solar and lunar directions that are marked at the Sun Dagger site.|$|E
5000|$|For an {{observer}} on the North Pole, the Sun reaches the highest {{position in the}} sky once a year in June. The day this occurs is called the June <b>solstice</b> day. Similarly, for {{an observer}} on the South Pole, the Sun reaches the highest position on the December <b>solstice</b> day. When it is the summer <b>solstice</b> at one Pole, it is the winter <b>solstice</b> on the other. The Sun's westerly motion never ceases as Earth is continually in rotation. However, the Sun's motion in declination {{comes to a stop}} at the moment of <b>solstice.</b> In that sense, <b>solstice</b> means [...] "sun-standing".|$|R

5|$|While {{the stars}} are fixed to their declinations the Sun is not. The rising point of the Sun varies {{throughout}} the year. It swings between two limits marked by the <b>solstices</b> {{a bit like a}} pendulum, slowing as it reaches the extremes, but passing rapidly through the midpoint. If an archaeoastronomer can calculate from the azimuth and horizon height that a site was built to view a declination of +23.5° then he or she need not wait until 21 June to confirm the site does indeed face the summer solstice.

5|$|Egyptian shadow clocks divided daytime into 12 {{parts with}} each part further divided into more precise parts. One type of shadow clock {{consisted}} of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon. Obelisks functioned {{in much the same}} manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the summer and winter <b>solstices.</b> A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500, was similar in shape to a bent T-square. It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at noon, so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|Many ancient civilizations {{observed}} astronomical bodies, {{often the}} Sun and Moon, to determine times, dates, and seasons. The first calendars {{may have been}} created during the last glacial period, by hunter-gatherers who employed tools such as sticks and bones to track the phases of the moon or the seasons. Stone circles, such as England's Stonehenge, were built {{in various parts of}} the world, especially in Prehistoric Europe, and are thought to have been used to time and predict seasonal and annual events such as equinoxes or <b>solstices.</b> As those megalithic civilizations left no recorded history, little is known of their calendars or timekeeping methods. Methods of sexagesimal timekeeping, now common in both Western and Eastern societies, are first attested nearly 4,000years ago in Mesopotamia and Egypt. Mesoamericans similarly modified their usual vigesimal counting system when dealing with calendars to produce a 360-day year.|$|E
5000|$|The summer <b>solstice</b> {{occurs during}} the hemisphere's summer. [...] This is the {{northern}} <b>solstice</b> in the Northern Hemisphere {{and the southern}} <b>solstice</b> in the Southern Hemisphere. Depending on the shift of the calendar, the summer <b>solstice</b> occurs some time between June 20 and June 22 in the Northern Hemisphere and between December 20 and December 23 {{each year in the}} Southern Hemisphere. The same dates in the opposite hemisphere are referred to as the winter <b>solstice.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Summer <b>solstice</b> {{and winter}} <b>solstice</b> {{are the most}} common names, {{referring}} to the seasons they are associated with. However, these can be ambiguous since the northern hemisphere's summer is the southern hemisphere's winter, and vice versa. The Latinate names estival <b>solstice</b> (summer) and hibernal <b>solstice</b> (winter) are sometimes used to the same effect, as are midsummer and midwinter.|$|R

5|$|To {{test this}} idea he {{surveyed}} hundreds of stone rows and circles. Any individual alignment could indicate a direction by chance, but {{he planned to}} show that together the distribution of alignments was non-random, showing {{that there was an}} astronomical intent to the orientation of {{at least some of the}} alignments. His results indicated the existence of eight, sixteen, or perhaps even thirty-two approximately equal divisions of the year. The two <b>solstices,</b> the two equinoxes and four cross-quarter days, days half-way between a solstice and the equinox were associated with the medieval Celtic calendar. While not all these conclusions have been accepted, it has had an enduring influence on archaeoastronomy, especially in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In the Babylonian star {{catalogues}} {{dating from}} at least 1100 BCE, what later became known as Corvus was called the Raven (MUL.UGA.MUSHEN). As with more familiar Classical astronomy, it was placed sitting on {{the tail of the}} Serpent (Greek Hydra). The Babylonian constellation was sacred to Adad, the god of rain and storm; in the second Millennium it would have risen just before the autumnal rainy season. John H. Rogers observed that Hydra signified Ningishzida, the god of the underworld in the Babylonian compendium MUL.APIN. He proposed that Corvus and Crater (along with Hydra) were death symbols and marked the gate to the underworld. These two constellations, along with the eagle Aquila and the fish Piscis Austrinus, were introduced to the Greeks around 500 BCE; they marked the winter and summer <b>solstices</b> respectively. Furthermore, Hydra had been a landmark as it had straddled the celestial equator in antiquity. Corvus and Crater also featured in the iconography of Mithraism, which is thought to have been of middle-eastern origin before spreading into Ancient Greece and Rome.|$|E
5|$|The Moon's {{appearance}} is considerably more complex. Its motion, like the Sun, is between two limits — known as lunistices rather than <b>solstices.</b> However, its travel between lunistices is considerably faster. It takes a sidereal month to complete its cycle {{rather than the}} year-long trek of the Sun. This is further complicated as the lunistices marking {{the limits of the}} Moon's movement move on an 18.6 year cycle. For slightly over nine years the extreme limits of the moon are outside the range of sunrise. For the remaining half of the cycle the Moon never exceeds the limits of the range of sunrise. However, much lunar observation was concerned with the phase of the Moon. The cycle from one New Moon to the next runs on an entirely different cycle, the Synodic month. Thus when examining sites for lunar significance the data can appear sparse due the extremely variable nature of the moon. See Moon for more details.|$|E
