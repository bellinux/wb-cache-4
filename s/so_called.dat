5|$|To {{strengthen}} the city's firefighting capabilities, the city established a reserve unit called the Exempt Fireman's Company, <b>so</b> <b>called</b> {{because it was}} made up of firemen who were exempt from militia and jury duty. The company was led by veteran fireman Zophar Mills, who had helped stop the great 1835 fire from crossing Wall Street.|$|E

5|$|At {{this crucial}} juncture, Uxbridge ordered his two brigades of British heavy cavalry—formed unseen behind the ridge—to charge {{in support of}} the hard-pressed infantry. The 1st Brigade, known as the Household Brigade, {{commanded}} by Major-General Lord Edward Somerset, consisted of guards regiments: the 1st and 2nd Life Guards, the Royal Horse Guards (the Blues), and the 1st (King's) Dragoon Guards. The 2nd Brigade, also known as the Union Brigade, commanded by Major-General Sir William Ponsonby, was <b>so</b> <b>called</b> as it consisted of an English, the 1st (The Royals); a Scottish, 2nd ('Scots Greys'); and an Irish, 6th (Inniskilling); regiment of heavy dragoons.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, German {{mathematician}} Petra Gummelt {{demonstrated that}} a covering (<b>so</b> <b>called</b> to {{distinguish it from}} a non-overlapping tiling) equivalent to the Penrose tiling can be constructed using a single decagonal tile if two kinds of overlapping regions are allowed. The decagonal tile is decorated with colored patches, and the covering rule allows only those overlaps compatible with the coloring. A suitable decomposition of the decagonal tile into kites and darts transforms such a covering into a Penrose (P2) tiling. Similarly, a P3 tiling {{can be obtained by}} inscribing a thick rhomb into each decagon; the remaining space is filled by thin rhombs.|$|E
5|$|Other {{rooms in}} the state suite include the Red Room— <b>so</b> <b>called</b> because its walls are covered in red brocade— a large drawing room {{containing}} paintings by Jan Brueghel and Charles Le Brun. Like much of the palace the room contains ornate 18th-century French-style furniture. From the Red Room leads the York Room. Furnished as a state bedchamber, this room is frescoed with illustrations of the four seasons by Gregorio de Ferrari. The following room, known as the Yellow Room (or sometimes as the Louis XV Bedchamber), is another state bedroom.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of war, Congress Heights (<b>so</b> <b>called</b> because the Capitol building in downtown Washington could {{be seen from the}} tops of the hills) were owned by the Berry family, who also owned much of the Anacostia River bottomland {{to the west of the}} Heights. In the days following the First Battle of Bull Run, panicked efforts by the Union were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack. These makeshift entrenchments were largely confined to the direct approaches to Washington and the bridges that spanned the Potomac.|$|E
5|$|The Buffalo Lawn is <b>so</b> <b>called</b> {{because of}} the replica of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Silver Buffalo Award that was {{presented}} by the Boy Scouts of America in 1926. This was to honour the Unknown Scout that helped William D. Boyce bring Scouting to the United States. Located there is a signpost with the directions and distances to all the World Scout Jamborees from Gilwell Park. Surrounding the Buffalo Lawn {{is part of the}} original balustrade of London Bridge which was re-built in 1820. The sections were moved to Gilwell Park after being purchased at auction in 1826.|$|E
5|$|The T-26 Model 1933 carried 122 {{rounds of}} 45mm ammunition, firing armour-piercing 45mm rounds with a muzzle {{velocity}} of , or lower-velocity high-explosive munitions. Tanks intended for company commanders were {{equipped with a}} radio set and a hand-rail radio antenna on the turret (<b>so</b> <b>called</b> radio tanks). Later the hand-rail antenna was replaced with a buggy-whip antenna, because experience in the Spanish Civil War and Battle of Lake Khasan showed that the hand-rail antenna drew fire onto commander tanks.|$|E

5|$|The orbital angular {{momentum}} of electrons is quantized. Because the electron is charged, it produces an orbital magnetic moment that {{is proportional to the}} {{angular momentum}}. The net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to the vector sum of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and the nucleus. The magnetic moment of the nucleus is negligible compared with that of the electrons. The magnetic moments of the electrons that occupy the same orbital (<b>so</b> <b>called,</b> paired electrons) cancel each other out.|$|E

Among the more famous are the Edict (hatt-ı şerîf) of Gülhane of 1839 and the Imperial Reform Edict (hatt-ı hümayun) of 1856. For this last one, the Turkish term Tanzimat Fermanı is more accurate. This decree, which started the so-called Tanzimat reforms, is <b>so</b> <b>called</b> because it carries a handwritten order by the sultan {{to the grand}} vizier to execute his command.|$|E
5|$|The bayside {{residential}} area called La Playa lies somewhat {{north of the}} original La Playa, the beach where commercial and military ships anchored during {{the early days of}} the city. La Playa includes some of the most expensive homes in San Diego. Some bayfront homes have private piers for small boats. The hills above La Playa are known as the Wooded Area on the bay side of Catalina Boulevard (<b>so</b> <b>called</b> because of the many mature trees in the area), and the College Area on the ocean side (because of the proximity of Point Loma Nazarene College). The Sunset Cliffs neighborhood is on the west side, above ocean bluffs, and is known for its views of the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
