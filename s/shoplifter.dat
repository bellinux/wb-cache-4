5|$|Peter Neal, an American {{writer of}} violent horror novels, is in Italy {{to promote his}} latest work, Tenebrae. He is {{accompanied}} by his literary agent, Bullmer and his assistant, Anne. Neal is unaware that {{he has also been}} followed to Rome by his embittered ex-wife, Jane. Just before Neal arrived in Rome, Elsa, a young female <b>shoplifter,</b> was murdered with a razor by an unseen assailant. The murderer sends Neal a letter informing him that his books have inspired him to go on a killing spree. Neal is soon contacted by the police in the form of Detective Giermani and his female partner, Inspector Altieri.|$|E
5|$|The pilot, {{along with}} the other 23 episodes from the first season, was {{released}} on a six-disc DVD and Blu-ray Disc set in the United States on September 20, 2011. The box-set had a series of deleted scenes from most episodes, including the pilot. The deleted scenes shown included Mary Ann during John's funeral, Chin Ho interrogating an underaged <b>shoplifter,</b> and Hesse waking up on shore. The episode also contained an audio commentary track by Peter M. Lenkov, Len Wiseman and Roberto Orci, along with its own featurette entitled Picture Perfect – The Making of the Pilot.|$|E

25|$|The centre has {{not gone}} without its share of local controversy. In 2006, a {{security}} guard and disgraced former officer of the Western Australia Police working at the centre received a 12-month suspended sentence {{for the destruction of}} crucial evidence in the trial of a police assault against an alleged teenage <b>shoplifter.</b> The security officer, then head of the security at the centre gave evidence at a Corruption and Crime Commission hearing in June 2006 that he had taped over the footage showing the assault, because he did not understand why the Constable hit the alleged offender and did not want the officer to lose his job.|$|E
500|$|References to Shaun of the Dead {{are also}} present in the film. In one scene, Nicholas wants to chase a <b>shoplifter</b> by jumping over garden fences; however, Danny is reluctant. Nicholas says, [...] "What's the matter, Danny? You never taken a {{shortcut}} before?" [...] He smiles assuredly before jumping over {{three in a row}} (according to the DVD commentary, Pegg vaulted over three fences, and a stunt man did a back flip over the fourth). When Danny attempts it, he trips and falls through the fence. This is almost identical to a scene in Shaun of the Dead, including the fall-through-fence gag, albeit with the pratfalling role reverse: in Shaun of the Dead it happens to Pegg's character rather than Frost's, and he falls over the fence rather than through it. The DVD commentary says that Frost purposely looked back at the camera after crashing through the fence, to show that he had done the stunt rather than someone else.|$|E
500|$|As {{in many of}} Argento's films, {{which tend}} to eroticize the murder of {{beautiful}} women, gender, sexuality and power are major issues foregrounded by the film. The fictional novel within the film is described as being [...] "about human perversion {{and its effects on}} society". Male and female sexual deviancy are a central theme, with the victims being sexually liberated women who the first killer – conservative TV presenter Cristiano Berti – refers to as [...] "filthy, slimy perverts". The first victim is a sexually promiscuous <b>shoplifter,</b> and his next two are the lesbian reporter and her bisexual lover. Berti murders the comparatively normal Maria only because she inadvertently discovers his twisted compulsion. His [...] "moral crusade" [...] is inspired by – and in his mind given credibility by – Neal's novel. Neal's own motivations for becoming a killer are revealed in [...] "Freudian flashbacks". As summarized by McDonagh, these flashbacks [...] "expose how the misogyny evident in his books actually stems from being sexually humiliated by a beautiful woman in his youth." [...] McDonagh also notes that Tenebrae expands on the themes of sexuality and transvestitism found in Argento's earlier films, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, The Cat o' Nine Tails, Four Flies on Grey Velvet (1972), and Deep Red (1975), but believes that Tenebraes [...] "overall sensuality sets it apart from Argento's other gialli." [...] She says that the film's sexual content and abundant nudity make it [...] "the first of Argento's films to have an overtly erotic aspect", and further notes that [...] "Tenebrae is fraught with free-floating anxiety that is specifically sexual in nature." [...] Gracey notes that in several scenes the victims gaze directly into the camera, which demonstrates Argento's [...] "preoccupation with voyeurism and spectacle".|$|E

500|$|Writing for the Wiltshire Gazette and Herald, the Liberal Democrat MP Duncan Hames {{argued that}} the {{programme}} would contribute little to the subject: [...] "We do {{need to have a}} rational, informed debate about how to improve our welfare system, but the editorial line taken by supposedly factual ‘reality TV’ adds very little to that." [...] The programme was condemned by the current Ladywood MP, Labour's Shabana Mahmood: [...] "I found it shocking that Channel 4 or any other organisation would present poverty as entertainment. It was profoundly wrong." [...] In the Radio Times, Clare Short, who represented the constituency prior to Mahmood, said the series was [...] "totally unrepresentative" [...] of the area, and condemned it as [...] "crummy and misleading". Others have also criticised Benefits Street, arguing it does not present a balanced view of the subject. Labour MP Anne Begg, chair of the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee, said that the programme was a [...] "misrepresentation" [...] of people claiming benefits, arguing that it focused on those claiming unemployment benefits which makes up a small proportion of the overall welfare bill. Referring to the first episode that featured a <b>shoplifter,</b> Chris Williamson (also a Labour MP) said it was [...] "irresponsible" [...] to portray him as a typical benefits claimant. Owen Jones, a columnist for The Independent, described the series as [...] "medieval stocks updated for a modern format". In an article for the Birmingham Mail, writer and television personality Samantha Brick, a native of Birmingham, said that the series was an [...] "atrociously unbalanced" [...] view of the city. Shadow Welfare Minister Chris Bryant claimed that the residents of The Bishop's Avenue in Hampsteadknown as Billionaire's Row because of its expensive propertieswere as likely to have drink and drugs problems as the residents of James Turner Street.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his second}} film, City Across the River (also in 1949), he was {{credited}} as [...] "Anthony Curtis".

He {{could also be}} spotted in Francis (1950), Woman in Hiding (1950), and I Was a <b>Shoplifter</b> (1950).|$|E
2500|$|Justice Breyer {{conceded that}} {{successful}} proportionality challenges to criminal sentences should be rare, but argued that Ewing's sentence could be successfully challenged as disproportional. [...] For Breyer, three {{characteristics of a}} sentence bear on whether it is proportional: {{the length of the}} sentence in real time, the conduct that triggered the sentence, and the offender's criminal history. [...] Although Ewing was a recidivist, his present crime was not violent, and so he should not have been sentenced as harshly as a recidivist who had committed yet another violent crime. [...] The experience of some federal judges, as described by data aggregated by the United States Sentencing Commission, suggested that Ewing would not have been treated so harshly under federal sentencing law. [...] Finally, the fact that Ewing's sentence would have been the same if he had been convicted of a violent crime, like rape or murder, suggested it was too harsh a sentence for a <b>shoplifter,</b> even a recidivist <b>shoplifter</b> like Ewing. [...] "Outside the California three strikes context, Ewing's recidivist sentence is virtually unique in its harshness for his offense of conviction, and by a considerable degree." ...|$|E

2500|$|A serious {{challenge}} to the Baumes law concerned {{the case of a}} <b>shoplifter</b> named Ruth St. Clair, who was arrested for the fourth time after stealing items from a department store in December 1929. St. Clair had three prior convictions of a similar nature in 1920, 1924, and 1926, for stealing items such as coats and dresses from stores. [...] When she was convicted of the 1929 offense, the Baumes law imposed a life sentence, the first given to a woman since its enactment. St. Clair's case attracted much media attention, but the United States Supreme Court upheld her sentence in 1930. St. Clair eventually spent eight years in prison, before her sentence was commuted to time served.|$|E
2500|$|A key {{recurring}} {{character was}} Geri Tyler (Geri Jewell), Blair's cousin who has cerebral palsy. Other recurring characters included the judgment-impaired Miko Wakamatsu (Lauren Tom), the delivery boy Roy (Loren Lester) who was enamored with Jo, [...] the royal princess Alexandra (Heather McAdam) and the snobbish Boots St. Clair (Jami Gertz). <b>Shoplifter</b> Kelly (Pamela Segall) {{was billed as}} a regular during the fifth season. Other guest roles included the boyfriends of the girls; Jo's parents, played by Alex Rocco and Claire Malis; Blair's parents, played by Nicolas Coster and Marj Dusay (Blair's mother was played by Pam Huntington in one episode during the first season); Tootie's parents, played by Kim Fields' real-life mother, actress Chip Fields, and Robert Hooks; and Natalie's parents, played by Norman Burton and Mitzi Hoag. (Natalie's grandmother was played by Molly Picon, and appeared in two episodes.) Hugh Gillin appeared in four episodes as Howard. Officer Ziaukus was played by Larry Wilmore, and appeared in 2 episodes. A 1984 episode was built around Natalie {{coming to terms with}} the sudden death of her father. Characters from Diff'rent Strokes also appeared in some episodes of both season one and season two. Shawnte Northcutte from The New Mickey Mouse Club appeared as Madge in the 1980 episode [...] "Who Am I?". Other recurring characters included Tootie's boyfriend Jeff Williams (Todd Hollowell), Blair's boyfriend Cliff (Woody Brown), and Mr. Charles Parker (Roger Perry), who served as headmaster of Eastland following Lawlor's exit from the show.|$|E

5000|$|Researchers divide <b>shoplifters</b> {{into two}} categories: [...] "boosters," [...] {{professionals}} who resell what they steal, and [...] "snitches," [...] amateurs who steal items for their personal use. Motivations for shoplifting are controversial among researchers, although they generally agree that <b>shoplifters</b> {{are driven by}} either economic or psychosocial motives. Psychosocial motivations may include peer pressure, a desire for thrill or excitement, impulse, stealing because judgment is clouded by intoxication, or doing so because of a compulsion. Depression is the psychiatric disorder most commonly associated with shoplifting. Shoplifting is also associated with family or marital stress, social isolation, having had a difficult childhood, alcoholism or drug use, low self-esteem, and eating disorders, with bulimic <b>shoplifters</b> frequently stealing food. Some researchers have theorized that shoplifting is an unconscious attempt {{to make up for}} a past loss.|$|R

60|$|Martin {{had still}} {{proceeded}} as gravely as he began, and doubtless would have delivered an admirable lecture of morality, {{which might have}} exceedingly contributed to my reader's repose both of body and mind (the true ultimate end of ethics), but Jack was already gone a flight-shot beyond his patience. And as in scholastic disputes nothing serves to rouse the spleen of him that opposes {{so much as a}} kind of pedantic affected calmness in the respondent, disputants being for the most part like unequal scales, where the gravity of one side advances the lightness of the other, and causes it to fly up and kick the beam; so it happened here that the weight of Martin's arguments exalted Jack's levity, and made him fly out and spurn against his brother's moderation. In short, Martin's patience put Jack in a rage; but that which most afflicted him was to observe his brother's coat so well reduced into the state of innocence, while his own was either wholly rent to his shirt, or those places which had escaped his cruel clutches were still in Peter's livery. So that he looked like a drunken beau half rifled by bullies, or like a fresh tenant of Newgate when he has refused the payment of garnish, or like a discovered <b>shoplifter</b> left to the mercy of Exchange-women {111a}, or like a bawd in her old velvet petticoat resigned into the secular hands of the mobile {111b}. Like any or like all of these, a medley of rags, and lace, and fringes, unfortunate Jack did now appear; he would have been extremely glad to see his coat in the condition of Martin's, but infinitely gladder to find that of Martin in the same predicament with his. However, since neither of these was likely to come to pass, he thought fit to lend the whole business another turn, and to dress up necessity into a virtue. Therefore, after as many of the fox's arguments as he could muster up for bringing Martin to reason, as he called it, or as he meant it, into his own ragged, bobtailed condition, and observing he said all to little purpose, what alas! was left for the forlorn Jack to do, but, after a million of scurrilities against his brother, to run mad with spleen, and spite, and contradiction. To be short, here began a mortal breach between these two. Jack went immediately to new lodgings, and in a few days it was for certain reported that he had run out of his wits. In a short time after he appeared abroad, and confirmed the report by falling into the oddest whimsies that ever a sick brain conceived.|$|E
