50|$|Thread protectors {{are widely}} used on {{firearms}} to protect threaded barrels. Some firearms are manufactured with thread and protectors in the factory, but most thread protectors {{are part of the}} aftermarket process of fitting a <b>sound</b> <b>moderator</b> (silencer) or a muzzle brake. They protect the threads from mechanical damage and ensure the center lines line up when the muzzle device is replaced.|$|E
5000|$|A suppressor, sound suppressor, <b>sound</b> <b>moderator,</b> or {{silencer}} is {{a device}} attached to {{or part of}} the barrel of a firearm or air gun which reduces the amount of noise and visible muzzle flash generated by firing. Suppressors are typically constructed of a metal cylinder with internal mechanisms to reduce the sound of firing by slowing the escaping propellant gas. (A flash suppressor specifically cools or disperses burning gases typically exiting from the muzzle of a carbine-length weapon, without reference to sound reduction.) ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1977 Weihrauch {{produced}} the HW 35 Lochschaft (HW 35LS Thumb-hole stock) verstion, then in 1986 the HW 35 Safari, {{a variant of}} the HW 35 standard with a green tinged stock. Perhaps the most sought after by collectors is one of a limited run of 1000 [...]22 (5.5 mm) Jubilee 55 Edition (HW 35 KLS [...] ) to celebrate 55 years of continuous production of the HW 35 in 2006. This model had a screw cut barrel with a <b>sound</b> <b>moderator,</b> a blue laminate stock and was supplied without open sights.|$|E
40|$|This {{report has}} been {{prepared}} as {{a summary of}} the key findings of a study investigating the feasibility of using <b>sounds</b> <b>moderators</b> on firearms in New South Wales (NSW) for the purposes of hunting game and feral animals. The study was commissioned by the Game Council for NSW (hereafter referred to as the ‘Council’) with the intent of identifying any known impediments to the use of <b>sound</b> <b>moderators</b> for hunting purposes. While based largely on secondary data, the investigative panel found no link between <b>sound</b> <b>moderators</b> and their use in petty or organised criminal activity. Further, and based upon a review of other legislative regimes where moderator use is legally permitted, the panel submits that the benefits pertaining to moderator use by the civilian, hunting, law enforcement and military communities points to a need for a more informed debate on legislative change within NSW...|$|R
5000|$|Suppressors (also {{referred}} to as silencers or <b>sound</b> <b>moderators</b> in Ireland) may be licensed; these are legally classed as firearms {{in and of themselves}} but are usually dealt with by authorisations on a firearms certificate (signified by a capital 'S' printed on the certificate itself) rather than a separate licence.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a summary of}} a 2011 {{academic}} study commissioned by the New South Wales Government (Game Council) investigating the possible legalizing of firearm <b>sound</b> <b>moderators</b> for hunting and shooting. The study examined the pragmatic {{advantages and disadvantages of}} this product in the event it could be made available to the general public in Australia. A comparison between Australia and New Zealand vis-à-vis public access to <b>sound</b> <b>moderators</b> highlights not only the opposite ends of the continuum adopted by two similar countries, but also the arbitrary nature of how attitudes influence product acceptability and availability. Advantages of de-criminalisation in Australia include; hearing-loss prevention, increased accuracy, reduced recoil, reduced stock disturbance, reduced noise pollution, increased safety and an increase in the potential for humane culling. Disadvantages include cost, a deleterious shift in the firearm’s centre of gravity, and the potential of criminal and civil misuse. While based largely on secondary data, the investigation found no obvious link between <b>sound</b> <b>moderators</b> and their use in petty or organized criminal activity. Further, and based upon a review of other legislative regimes where moderator use is legally permitted, the authors conclude that the benefits pertaining to moderator use by civilian shooting communities points to a need for a more informed debate on legislative change within Australia. While the author’s note the logical consequence of such findings should be a move towards de-criminalisation in Australia they also appreciate that entrenched attitudes relating to firearms, both as a product and consumer lifestyle, will likely result in impassioned minority resistance to any change in the status quo...|$|R
50|$|The XM177 uses {{a unique}} flash {{suppressor}} sometimes called a flash or <b>sound</b> <b>moderator</b> for its 10 in barrel. This device is 4.2 in long and was designed {{primarily as a}} counterbalance measure as the shorter barrel makes the weapon unwieldy. This device reduces flash signature greatly and sound signature slightly, making the normally louder short barreled carbine sound like a longer barreled M16A1. Although it has no internal baffles and does not completely reduce the sound signature to subsonic levels, because it alters the sound level of the weapon, the US Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives has declared this muzzle device to be a sound suppressor and regulates its civilian purchase in the United States.|$|E
50|$|The SR-3M is an {{improved}} {{variant of the}} SR-3 Vikhr. It features {{an improved}} polymer furniture, a more convenient charging handle, AS-style controls (safety lever, semi-automatic/full automatic selector switch inside the trigger guard, charging handle), AS-style side-folding shoulder stock, a redesigned handguard with a folding foregrip and where the rear sight is now located, a specially developed quick-detachable suppressor (<b>sound</b> <b>moderator),</b> a Warsaw Pact rail for mounting day or night optics and other various optical sights {{on the left side}} of the receiver and a new magazine with a 30 round capacity which provides a more reliable feeding during automatic fire and it is still compatible with the 10- and 20-round magazines from the SR-3, AS Val and VSS Vintorez.|$|E
5000|$|The {{internal}} {{action on}} all 35s was identical but the rifle {{was available in}} three [...] "custom" [...] versions {{with varying degrees of}} aesthetic refinements and three different lengths of barrel. The HW 35 STD (Standard) has a beech stock while the HW 35L (DeLux) a Walnut finished one with a raised cheek piece. The top of the range was the HW 35E (Export) with a selected walnut stock, palm swell, rosewood pistol grip cap with a white line spacer and a 60mm longer barrel (the longer barrel did not increase power). Later this version also had a <b>sound</b> <b>moderator</b> on the muzzle. Both the Standard and the DeLux were available as a [...] "K" [...] for Karabiner (Carbine) style with a shorter barrel.|$|E
5000|$|A rifle is {{used that}} {{complies}} with the minimum requirements of the Deer Act (1991) in England and Wales or in the Deer (Scotland) Act 1996 in calibre and ballistic performance. Not only are there differences in the law regarding the calibre and ballistic performance between Scotland and England & Wales, (popular calibres are [...]243, [...]270, [...]303, [...]308, 6.5×55mm, [...]25-06, and [...]30-06) {{there are differences in}} the deer open seasons too. In recent times the use of <b>sound</b> <b>moderators</b> has greatly increased as a health and safety measure.|$|R
5000|$|The tiny {{case of the}} [...]22 LR and the subsonic {{velocities}} (when using subsonic ammunition) make it {{well suited}} for use with a firearm suppressor (also known as silencers or <b>sound</b> <b>moderators).</b> The low volume of powder gases means that [...]22 LR suppressors are often {{no larger than a}} bull barrel; the Ruger 10/22 and Ruger MK II are common choices, because of their reliability and low cost, and the resulting product is often nearly indistinguishable from a bull barrel model (although weighing far less). Where firearm suppressors are only minimally restricted, a [...]22 LR firearm with a suppressor is often favored for plinking, as it does not require hearing protection or disturb the neighbors. Local government agencies sometimes use suppressed rimfire weapons for animal control, since dangerous animals or pests can be dispatched in populated areas without causing undue alarm.|$|R
500|$|Lee {{writes that}} the {{silencer}} evidence became confused {{because of the way}} the exhibit was named. It was first called SBJ/1, because it was handed over by DS Stan Jones (SBJ). When it was learned that David Boutflour had found it and Jones had merely handed it over, the silencer was renamed exhibit DB/1. But because there was a DC David Bird, it was renamed again to DRB/1. The name changes led to confusion in later documents, giving the impression that more than one silencer had been found. In 2011, Lee writes, Bamber's blog announced: [...] "We can now prove 100% that there were two <b>sound</b> <b>moderators</b> obtained by police at different times". The CCRC responded that year that the claims were [...] "not supported by the material that exists...". Again in 2013 Bamber's blog said: [...] "I can now prove with 100% certainty that Essex police seized on Parker Hale (MM1 type) suppressor from the house on 7 August 1985" [...] (the day of the murder, rather than the day the cousin found it). According to The Times in 2013, Bamber said he intended to show the police took four silencers from his family members, including the one in the gun cupboard, and that evidence and paperwork from them—and from an additional laboratory silencer—was mixed up.|$|R
5000|$|The AK-9 {{features}} the same tried and proven gas operated, rotary bolt action and same [...] "Kalashnikov-style" [...] controls including reciprocating bolt handle, safety/fire selector lever and overall layout with side-folding polymer buttstock. The Polymer furniture is improved {{with the addition}} of accessories such as a Picatinny rail {{on the bottom of the}} forend and the left side of the receiver is fitted with a Warsaw Pact rail. The barrel can be fitted with a specially designed quick-detachable suppressor (<b>sound</b> <b>moderator),</b> which is especially effective with the 9×39mm subsonic cartridge. The magazine is made of black polymer, holds 20 rounds of ammunition and appears to be of proprietary design, not compatible with other (competing) weapons of the same caliber, which are already in service with Russian military and law enforcement.|$|E
50|$|The {{latest version}} (Ultra SE) {{features}} BSA's redesigned magazine, which boasts improved reliability {{over the previous}} model. The two-stage multi-shot system (MMC) has been replaced with a traditional bolt action assembly that increases the reload speed, and makes fitting and using a bipod considerably easier (due to {{the removal of the}} front plunger style cocking system). The hammer/valve assembly has been changed to a new 'Fast Strike' design which is claimed to increase consistency and shot count by around 20%. The factory fitted <b>sound</b> <b>moderator</b> has been replaced with a muzzle brake. The safety has been moved from the right to left hand side so as to not interfere with the bolt action. A pressure gauge is now present on the underneath of the stock, which enables the user to see how much charge is in the rifle.|$|E
40|$|Health and Safety {{regulations}} are becoming ever more stringent {{in order to}} protect us in all aspects of our daily lives to prevent noise pollution and damage to hearing. For those in the military and some areas of civilian life working with firearms there is a definite need to reduce the sound levels from them. In order to do this a working knowledge of <b>sound</b> <b>moderators</b> and suppressors is considered vital in order to assess their capabilities and optimise their performance. The project looks at a theoretical model of an integral suppressor for a modified 12 bore shotgun. The model was used to determine the area of holes through the barrel, allowing gas into the suppressor, has the greatest effect on the pressure within the suppressor. It was found that the volume of the suppressor and position of the hole through the barrel did not have such a significant effect on the pressure. The theoretical work was supported by experimental trials which confirmed the barrel hole size has a significant effect on the pressure. The experimental work also showed for the low pressure system the hole size through the baffles did not {{have a significant effect on}} the pressure. Work was carried out to establish whether current practice for proofing suppressors was sufficient. The results show that proof rounds give a lower pressure in an external suppressor than standard ammunition. Tests on improvised suppressors showed they are effective and allowed a visual analysis on suppressors. Baffles were shown to be advantageous in a suppressor configuration.

40|$|With {{increased}} {{stressful situations}} {{in the society}} the demands for restorative environments with a high ability to reduce stress increase. Studies of urban soundscapes have mainly focused {{on what kind of}} sounds that cause annoyance, or increase stress. Fewer have addressed the opposite: how may sound decrease perceived stress levels? Visual modality studies show a high correlation between preferred environments and their ability to reduce stress levels. Hypothetically the same should apply within the auditory modality. In order to study the possible effect of preferred <b>sounds</b> as a <b>moderator</b> for stress reduction: 24 participants were exposed to a stress inducing computer game and a subsequent rest while listening to either preferred or non-preferred sounds. The sounds were environmental sounds and rated by each participant in terms of preference before the experiment started. Experienced stress was measured right after the stress induction and after 20 minute long rests. The results show a significant decrease of perceived stress when exposed to preferred environmental sounds. When listening to the less preferred sounds during the rest there was no significant reduction of perceived stress. The results will be discussed in relation to theories of emoacoustics and attention restoration...|$|R
