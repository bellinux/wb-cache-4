40|$|According to the {{principle}} of reciprocal faith among the judicial systems of the Member States of the European Union, it is for the court seized with an action falling within the scope of application of EC Regulation n. 44 / 2001 to determine the validity and enforceability of an arbitration clause within the assessment which it is expected to make of its own jurisdiction pursuant to the Regulation. In its decision of 10 February 2009 concerning case C- 185 / 07, Allianz S. p. A. (formerly Riunione Adriatica di Sicurtà) v. West Tankers Inc., the European Court of Justice seems to have departed somewhat from its previous case law, notably the Marc Rich and Van Uden cases, attributing decisive relevance to the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> which would have been affected by the anti-suit injunction, instead of adequately considering whether the application for the injunction could be considered in itself as falling within the scope of application of the Regulation...|$|E
40|$|Rule 40 (1) of Dicey, Morris and Collins 1 {{reads as}} follows: A court {{of a foreign}} country has {{jurisdiction}} {{to give a judgment}} in rem capable of enforcement or recognition in England if the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> wherein that judgment was given was immovable or movable property which was {{at the time of the}} proceedings situate in that country. Its application seems to be simple enough. But the commentary to r 40 warns us, “[t]he question whether a foreign judgment is in personam or in rem is sometimes a difficult one on which English judges have been divided in opinion”. This warning, however, still falls rather short. As two opinions recently handed down by the Privy Council illustrate, r 40 (1) raises two distinct issues: one, whether for purposes of recognition or enforcement, a foreign judgment is to be characterized as being in rem or in personam, and two, whether the foreign “judgment” is a judgment at all...|$|E
