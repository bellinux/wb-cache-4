[...] "Jason was so stoic and didn't {{really get to}} show a lot of personality, unless it was with Spinelli or Sam," [...] he said. Dylan {{has a sense of}} humor, and the actor felt that it would bring out a [...] "lighter side" [...] of his acting. In addition to his [...] "entire makeover" [...] which included a new hairstyle, Burton lost weight to play Dylan, as the costume department wanted him to look younger. Burton admitted during an interview with Entertainment Weekly that he was worried about how Dylan would be received, considering the [...] "persona" [...] of Jason is out there; he hoped [...] "people will buy" [...] Dylan, although <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> [...] "You are Jason and that's it." [...] Burton told Yahoo! that: [...] " [...] extremely different. That's the biggest thing for me, that after playing a character, which I loved, for 21 years, coming here and trying to do something different - 'cause I know fans are always gonna see me as that character if they watch the show and if they watch both shows... So, it's definitely a challenge because I was so used to playing that character." [...] Jason's [...] "confined" [...] ways allowed Dylan to have a [...] "little more" [...] of Burton's own personality.|$|E
2500|$|Proponents of Japanese whaling (including the Government of Japan) often {{argue that}} it is a {{cultural}} practice which foreigners should not oppose on the basis of cultural differences. Joji Morishita of Japanese Fisheries Agency in 2001 noted that the Japanese public also feels that anti-whaling groups are covertly racist. With Norway and Iceland hunting whales on a commercial basis, according to Morishita, [...] "Singling out [...] whaling is cultural imperialism – <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> it's racism. Norway and Iceland are also whalers, but the criticism of Japan is stronger." [...] However, critics have forcibly attacked the [...] "cultural" [...] defense, with for example Sea Shepherd Conservation Society representatives comparing it to forced female genital cutting in Sudan, saying that although it is a practice that may have cultural roots, it still should be opposed out of necessity. A professor of environmental studies in Japan wrote in his book that Japan's modern commercial whaling bears little resemblance to the small-scale subsistence whaling that, until the dawn of the 20th century, was limited to certain coastal regions, and Japan's whale-eating culture was also very limited in scope and an invented tradition, only lasting 20 years from the end of World War II to the early 1960s to augment Japanese school lunch programs during the U.S. occupation.|$|E

Finally, 19. 1 DEFINITION OF A SOUND TEXTURE In this chapter we present a method for resynthesis of sound textures, like the sound of rain, large crowds, fish tank bubbles, photocopiers and myriad others. Defining sound texture is no easy task.

The sound of rain, or of a crowd are perhaps better textures. But few will say that one voice makes a texture. ...|$|R

[...] "I {{came to him}} with some rare disco references and he made it very clear he didn't like them. There wasn't a great deal of understanding. Sometimes I thought we were on the same level, but then from the production that would come to light, I didn't feel that we were. I wasn't happy with the way some of the demos were sounding", Jackson explained. She also told The Sun that she was displeased with the public perception of her partnership with Langmaid: [...] "I <b>would</b> plainly <b>say</b> in interviews that I play all the parts. He doesn't even play an instrument but I wouldn't say that because I would never have been that blunt—you can't say anything because it makes you look petty so you end up shutting up. I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> we co-wrote and co-produced but <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> just <b>say</b> he wrote all the parts and he produced—that classic male/female thing which became infuriating.

40|$|The Nigerian {{economy is}} largely oil-based. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>say</b> it is a mono-product economy. The {{economy has been}} in dire straits over the years, because of a {{combination}} of the neglect of education, especially technical and vocational education and science-based technology education, poor leadership and governance, corruption, as well as poor monetary and fiscal policies. All these have made a review of the poor investment in human capital development and infrastructure and institutions that drive the Nigerian economy and national development rather compelling. The political leaders have always raised the people’s hope by painting glowing pictures of their development plans and how they would stimulate the economy and improve the people’s living conditions. Thus, they swore that they would give priority attention to human capital development and national development, and empower the citizens, particularly the poorly educated, unskilled, and unemployed youths, with relevant human skills capital and entrepreneurial skills to enable them to contribute profoundly to national development. Yet the political leaders have, over the years, failed to adequately fund education and strengthen the infrastructure and institutions that would drive the economy and create employment for the teeming population. Both the new-breed politicians, like the old politicians before them, are promising to transform the nation into an industrialized society and the people cannot hold their expectations. The reality though is that Nigeria cannot become an industrialized society without investing abundantly in human capital development (education and health), leadership, and technological capabilities, which means investing in the future development of the nation...|$|R

Yes; she is deeply read in Peter Parley's tomes and has an increasing love for fairy-tales, though seldom met with nowadays, and she will subscribe next year to the Juvenile Miscellany. But, truth to tell, she is apt to turn away from the printed page and keep gazing at the pretty pictures, such as the gay-colored ones which make this shop-window the continual loitering-place of children. What would Annie think if, in the book which I mean to send her on New Year's day, she should find her sweet little self bound up in silk or morocco with gilt edges, there to remain till she become a woman grown with children of her own to read about their mother's childhood?

6000|$|But Grabantak's strongholds were remarkably strong. A {{good deal}} of killing was done, and some {{destruction}} of property accomplished, {{but that did not}} effect the conquest of the great northern Savage. Neither did it prove either party to be right or wrong! Grabantak retired to impregnable fastnesses, and Amalatok returned to Poloeland [...] "covered with glory,"--some of his followers also covered with wounds, a few of which had fallen to his own share. The success, however, was not decided. On the whole, the result was rather disappointing, but Amalatok was brave and high-spirited, as <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>say.</b> He was not going to give in; not he! He would fight as long as a man was left to back him, and bring Grabantak to his knees--or die! Either event would, of course, have been of immense advantage to both nations. He ground his teeth and glared when he announced this determination, and also shook his fist, but a sharp twinge of pain in one of his unhealed wounds caused him to cease frowning abruptly.|$|E

On {{the point of}} reading the letter at last, I once more drew back voluntarily; {{it was too soon}} yet to drink that draught--the sparkle in the cup was so beautiful--I would watch it yet a minute. Then I remembered all at once that I had not said my prayers that morning. Having heard papa go down to breakfast a little earlier than usual, I had been afraid of keeping him waiting, and had hastened to join him as soon as dressed, thinking no harm to put off prayers till afterwards. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> I ought to have served God first and then man; but I don't think heaven could be jealous of anything I might do for papa. I believe I am superstitious. A voice seemed now to say that another feeling than filial affection was in question--to urge me to pray before I dared to read what I so longed to read--to deny myself yet a moment, and remember first a great duty. I have had these impulses ever since I can remember. I put the letter down and said my prayers, adding, at the end, a strong entreaty that whatever happened, I might not be tempted or led to cause papa any sorrow, and might never, in caring for others, neglect him. The very thought of such a possibility, so pierced my heart that it made me cry. But still, Lucy, I felt that in time papa would have to be taught the truth, managed, and induced to hear reason.|$|E
6000|$|We have {{considered}} Bernard Shaw as an Irishman. The {{next step is}} to consider him as an exile from Ireland living in Ireland; that, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> is a paradox after his own heart. But, indeed, such a complication is not really difficult to expound. The great religion and the great national tradition which have persisted for so many centuries in Ireland have encouraged these clean and cutting elements; but they have encouraged many other things which serve to balance them. The Irish peasant has these qualities which are somewhat peculiar to Ireland, a strange purity and a strange pugnacity. But the Irish peasant also has qualities which are common to all peasants, and his nation has qualities that are common to all healthy nations. I mean chiefly the things that most of us absorb in childhood; especially the sense of the supernatural and the sense of the natural; the love of the sky with its infinity of vision, and the love of the soil with its strict hedges and solid shapes of ownership. But here comes the paradox of Shaw; the greatest of all his paradoxes and the one of which he is unconscious. These one or two plain truths which quite stupid people learn at the beginning are exactly the one or two truths which Bernard Shaw may not learn even at the end. He is a daring pilgrim who has set out from the grave to find the cradle. He started from points of view which no one else was clever enough to discover, and he is at last discovering points of view which no one else was ever stupid enough to ignore. This absence of the red-hot truisms of boyhood; this sense that he is not rooted in the ancient sagacities of infancy, has, I think, {{a great deal to do}} with his position as a member of an alien minority in Ireland. He who has no real country can have no real home. The average autochthonous Irishman is close to patriotism because he is close to the earth; he is close to domesticity because he is close to the earth; he is close to doctrinal theology and elaborate ritual because he is close to the earth. In short, he is close to the heavens because he is close to the earth. But we must not expect any of these elemental and collective virtues in the man of the garrison. He cannot be expected to exhibit the virtues of a people, but only (as Ibsen would say) of an enemy of the people. Mr. Shaw has no living traditions, no schoolboy tricks, no college customs, to link him with other men. Nothing about him can be supposed to refer to a family feud or to a family joke. He does not drink toasts; he does not keep anniversaries; musical as he is I doubt if he would consent to sing. All this has something in it of a tree with its roots in the air. The best way to shorten winter is to prolong Christmas; and the only way to enjoy the sun of April is to be an April Fool. When people asked Bernard Shaw to attend the Stratford Tercentenary, he wrote back with characteristic contempt: [...] "I do not keep my own birthday, and I cannot see why I should keep Shakespeare's." [...] I think that if Mr. Shaw had always kept his own birthday he would be better able to understand Shakespeare's birthday--and Shakespeare's poetry.|$|E

This exquisite national park, with a combined natural and historical background, covers an area of 341 km2, and was declared to be a national park on October 27, 1980. High hills and steep cliffs, some over 1,200 metres above sea level, together with fascinating falls and different species of plants and wildlife, are some of the major attractions available in this park offered to nature-loving tourists or visitors. Furthermore, the archaeological and historical sites with ancient remains and relics make the park even more attractive, especially for critics and theologians. The park also contains a lot of natural beauties, such as the Khao Luang mountain range, Sai Rung Waterfall, an herbal garden, and the Savannah located in the high country of the Khao Luang range. High country of the Khao Luang mountain range: The four main peaks of the park are within the high country. These peaks offer beautiful views.
