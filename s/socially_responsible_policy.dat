The concept of social responsibility was defined by situating the essence and extent of social responsibility within the theory of public relations. The' discussion of social responsibility was done within the perspective of the social system, and a system theoretical 'orientation -to social responsibility and public relations was explored. A clear distinction was drawn between internal and external social responsibility. The situation of social responsibility within the public relations domain was investigated by means of a critical analysis. This showed that the role of the public relations officer will have to change to accommodate new demands, and that a new corporative communications image of social responsibility has become necessary.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{evidence}} of connections between sustainability policy goals included in public procurement tenders and offers and their achievement through contract award. Design/methodology/approach – Two hypotheses based on extant literature and the inducement–contribution theory were tested by means of a survey of 281 procurement files from 2007 to 2009 relating to eight product categories and four European Union (EU) member states. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings – Findings indicate that public procurement was more effective in influencing socially responsible goals than environmental goals. In terms of supplier readiness, vendors achieved greater progress in delivering green than socially responsible operations. Research limitations/implications – The collection and analysis of data are based on procurement files, which is a new but also a complex procedure. In comparison to survey data, the data from procurement file analysis are less biased. Practical implications – Public procurement practitioners and sustainability policymakers should consider the use of public procurement as a lever to attain environmental and socially responsible goals. Social implications – Evidence has been provided to demonstrate the strategic use of public procurement impacts on environmental and socially responsible goals, thereby benefiting society. Originality/value – This study contributes in three main ways: first, by adding to existing, limited research on the use of public procurement as a lever of policy goals attainment; second, by examining environmental and <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>policy</b> in one study; and third, through providing evidence across EU member states...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>policies</b> have a {{positive}} impact on a firm’s brand equity in the short-term as well as in the long-term. Moreover, once we distinguish between different stakeholders, we posit that secondary stakeholders such as community are even more important than primary stakeholders (customers, shareholders, workers and suppliers) in generating brand equity. Policies aimed at satisfied community interests act as a mechanism to reinforce trust that gives further credibility to social responsible polices with other stakeholders. The result is a decrease in conflicts among stakeholders and greater stakeholder willingness to provide intangible resources that enhance brand equity. We provide support of our theoretical contentions making use of a panel data composed of 57 firms from 10 countries (the US, Japan, South Korea, France, the UK, Italy, Germany, Finland, Switzerland and the Netherlands) for the period 2002 to 2007.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is to {{identify}} {{the extent to which}} the perception of <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>policies</b> and the behaviour of employers may be considered important by employees in guiding their career decisions. In order to understand and outline the possible relationship between Corporate Social Performance and applicant attraction, we employ the theoretical frameworks of Stereotype Content Model (SCM), the BIAS Map and the subjective meaning of work. It appears that people relate to organisations or brands in a similar manner to the way they relate to individuals, making decisions based on how they perceive social actors on the fundamental dimensions of social perception—Warmth and Competence. Thus, the SCM and BIAS Map together may not only explain how people perceive the social world, but also allow the prediction of their emotions and behavioural intentions towards perceived agents, including organisations. Introducing this well-developed and cross-culturally tested theory of social perception into Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) discourse may, in our opinion, provide the grounds for an inspiring theoretical and profoundly practical perspective on developing sound CSR organisational practices. The chapter draws heavily on the theories of social cognition, social identity, and signalling, as well as, with regard to the moderating impact of the subjective meaning of work, on the Job–Career–Calling distinction. By analysing candidates’ preferences and perceptions, the possible relationship between the subjective meaning of work, the various types of social perceptions of corporate social policies, and applicant attraction are analysed, and a new model for understanding applicant attraction is presented...|$|R

Therefore, the role of exchange rate policy, capital controls and counter-cyclical fiscal policy in generating or avoiding crisis is analyzed.

The Portuguese higher education system is binary, including university and polytechnic institutions that can be public or private. On the one hand, the university and polytechnic subsystems are mainly differentiated by their formative role in research: the polytechnics are vocationally or professionally oriented and do not carry out fundamental research as the universities do; and the universities conducted applied research. On the other hand, specifically, the polytechnics institutions have as main objectives the regional development and a close interaction with its operational environment that provided a flexible reaction to changes in its environment. This differentiation mission between the two types of HEI justifies the promotion of diverse <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>policies</b> to support students with financial difficulties. Methodologically, this research presents two research approaches. The theoretical framework is based on literature review of arguments to mitigating the adverse economic and social impact of the crisis, {{in the context of the}} austerity imposed by the Memorandum of Understanding (2011) that launched Portugal into a deep recession that had devastating impacts on some sectors of the economy, as the higher education system.

Through the connection of both frameworks and research findings, HEI are able to improve their contribution to society in result of social support to students and public funding following a CSR strategy. The results of the research show that economic crisis severely affected Portugal.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop an {{integrated}} framework that aims to support the commitment of managers to green management and environmental strategies. Design/methodology/approach - Relevant literature is reviewed and critically assessed. A framework is provided with the objective of supporting the process of green management adoption and the success of environmental strategies. Findings - Green management issues have the potential to inform a wide range of business processes. The proposed framework clarifies that a multi-criteria approach (including the activity sector, drivers of green management adoption, strategic horizon and level of strategy) is needed to analyze the many critical actions that firms can develop to embrace green management.

We intend to add to this literature by introducing unique explanatory and contextual variables. The study explains the impact of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) on employee attitudes through justice within the context of cooperative employee relations. We argue that the concept of justice, which is implied in both <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> organizational <b>policies</b> and cooperative employee-employer relations, may be an important addition as a mediating variable. In essence, the study explores the mediating effects of the two primary types of justice, i. e., distributive and procedural, on the relationship between perceived corporate social responsibility, and job satisfaction, and affective commitment. Additionally, we introduce ethics-based psychological foundations, i. e., heuristic and deontic fairness theories to explain the studied relationship. The study also examines the moderated mediation effects of the cooperative industrial relations climate on perceived corporate social responsibility and justice perceptions. Our analysis supports the mediating role of both distributive and procedural justice perceptions. However, a moderated mediation role of the industrial relations climate was only found in the relationship between perceived corporate social responsibility, procedural justice, and employee attitudes.
