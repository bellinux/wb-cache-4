40|$|Human {{activity}} hotspots are {{the clusters}} of activity locations {{in space and}} time, and {{a better understanding of}} their functionality would be useful for urban land use planning and transportation. In this article, using trajectory data, we aim to infer the functionality of human activity hotspots from their scaling pattern in a reliable way. Specifically, a large number of <b>stopping</b> <b>locations</b> are extracted from trajectory data, which are then aggregated into activity hotspots. Activity hotspots are found to display scaling patterns in terms of the sublinear scaling relationships between the number of <b>stopping</b> <b>locations</b> and the number of points of interest (POIs), which indicates economies of scale of human interactions with urban land use. Importantly, this scaling pattern remains stable over time. This finding inspires us to devise an allometric ruler to identify the activity hotspots, whose functionality could be reliably estimated using the <b>stopping</b> <b>locations.</b> Thereafter, a novel Bayesian inference model is proposed to infer their urban functionality, which examines the spatial and temporal information of <b>stopping</b> <b>locations</b> covering 75 days. Experimental results suggest that the functionality of identified activity hotspots are reliably inferred by <b>stopping</b> <b>locations,</b> such as the railway station...|$|R

50|$|Bus <b>stop</b> <b>location</b> {{is another}} {{important}} consideration. Where there are far-side bus stops, an advance signal does not provide any benefit to the bus because {{it will not be}} able to merge into traffic during the advance signal phase. Where near-side stops are present, an advance signal can be highly effective in giving the bus a head start, however the bus <b>stop</b> <b>location</b> needs to consider the detection strategy used for the advance signal phase so that the bus is detected only after it is done serving the bus stop.It is preferable to provide a receiving lane on the far side of the intersection to provide an acceleration/merging area, however this is not always a requirement when an advance signal is used.|$|E

50|$|In the Detour, teams chose between Horse Sense and Horse Power. In Horse Sense, {{teams were}} given a set of {{directions}} by a gunslinger and - using only a stationary compass as a navigational aid - {{had to find a}} bag of loot buried in a field. They then had to deliver the bag to the lead bandit, and if the markings on their bag matched the coordinates given to them, he would give the team a coin with the name of the Pit <b>Stop</b> <b>location</b> on it as their next clue. In Horse Power, teams went down to a polo field and - using a wooden practice horse - had to get a goal within 9 strokes and received the trophy with the name of the Pit <b>Stop</b> <b>location</b> on its base as their next clue.|$|E

40|$|Quantifying {{factors that}} affect bus travel time along arterials is {{necessary}} to prioritize investments to reduce bus travel time and its variability and to design advanced prediction and traveler information systems. The joint effects of bus <b>stop</b> <b>location</b> (near vs. far side), intersection delay and traffic conditions on travel time have not been addressed in the literature. To fill this research gap, this study integrates detailed transit, signal phase and traffic data at the stop-to-stop level. Statistical modeling results indicate that red time {{and the proportion of}} red time per cycle are the key traffic signal timing {{factors that affect}} bus stop-to-stop travel time variability. Bus <b>stop</b> <b>location</b> also has a statistically significant effect on intersection signal delay and passenger boarding times.
