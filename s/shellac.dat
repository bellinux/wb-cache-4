5|$|Dyestuffs {{including}} carmine (cochineal), <b>shellac,</b> and kermes {{have been}} made from the bodies of insects. In classical times, Tyrian purple was extracted from sea snails such as Stramonita haemastoma (Muricidae) for the clothing of royalty, as recorded by Aristotle and Pliny the Elder.|$|E
5|$|A {{similarly}} {{enormous number}} of lac bugs are {{needed to make a}} kilogram of <b>shellac,</b> a brush-on colourant and wood finish. Additional uses of this traditional product include the waxing of citrus fruits to extend their shelf-life, and the coating of pills to moisture-proof them, provide slow-release or mask the taste of bitter ingredients.|$|E
5|$|After signing to Doghouse, {{the band}} drove to Chicago {{to record their}} debut {{full-length}} album with producer Bob Weston of <b>Shellac.</b> The album was recorded in only two days, with the band leaving on Friday after Ryan Pope got {{out of school and}} finishing {{in the early hours of}} Sunday morning. Two months after recording the album, the band embarked on their first national tour with Braid and Ethel Meserve with the first date of the tour taking place the day after Ryan's high school graduation.|$|E

5|$|The {{color of}} the <b>shellac</b> was matched to closets where the wood had not been darkened by {{exposure}} to light. The mosaic floors were recreated by Italian craftsmen {{at a cost of}} $50 per square foot ($538.12 per square meter). A local firm was found that could reproduce the complicated process of sandblasting and hide glue application used to create the original feather chipped glass. This reproduced glass was used to restore the partitions and naturally lit corridors of Root's design. To recreate the doors and wood trim, Donnell purchased the firm that had created the original oak woodwork—and still used the same 19th century machinery. Perfect replicas of the original aluminum light fixtures were fabricated from early photographs and carbon filament light bulbs were obtained to recreate the original lighting effect. A single surviving aluminum staircase was discovered behind a wall, restored, and used as a model to rebuild the lobby stairways and metalwork. The wainscoting on the upper floors was restored with marble salvaged from the recently modernized, nearby 19 LaSalle and Manhattan Buildings. Marble was purchased from the same Italian quarry that supplied Root's original construction to restore the lobby walls and ceilings.|$|E
25|$|A {{widely used}} old {{adhesive}} that is orange or very dark brown in appearance. Once dried, the adhesive {{is very hard}} and becomes increasingly more brittle over time. <b>Shellac</b> does not break down easily with commercially available products. Additionally, the resin has naturally-occurring dyes that can stain ceramic pink or black. The solvent that works best on this resin is Industrial methylated spirit or (IMA). <b>Shellac</b> is prepared by dissolving flakes of <b>shellac</b> in hot alcohol. The properties of <b>shellac</b> make it vulnerable to climatic conditions and inclined to deteriorate over time. Damage can even occur to <b>shellac</b> under the hot light of photography.|$|E
25|$|<b>Shellac</b> is {{produced}} from a resin secreted by the lac bug on specific trees in Asia. In {{addition to its}} use in industry, <b>shellac</b> is incorporated into some fruits, coffee beans, and candies as confectioner's glaze. Some vegans avoid confectioner's glaze because lac bugs may be killed during <b>shellac</b> production. Lac used to produce red dye {{may be even more}} injurious to lac bugs because while <b>shellac</b> comes from lac-bug secretions, lac dye's color comes from the insect bodies themselves.|$|E
50|$|Natural <b>shellacs,</b> lacquers, and {{varnishes}} {{were used}} in the past, as were waxes, often blended with oils.|$|R

25|$|Vinyl's lower {{surface noise}} level than <b>shellac</b> was not forgotten, nor was its durability. In the late 1930s, radio {{commercials}} and pre-recorded radio programs {{being sent to}} disc jockeys started being pressed in vinyl, so they would not break in the mail. In the mid-1940s, special DJ copies of records started being made of vinyl also, for the same reason. These were all 78rpm. During and after World War II, when <b>shellac</b> supplies were extremely limited, some 78rpm records were pressed in vinyl instead of <b>shellac,</b> particularly the six-minute 12-inch (30cm) 78rpm records produced by V-Disc for distribution to United States troops in World War II. In the 1940s, radio transcriptions, which were usually on 16-inch records, but sometimes 12-inch, were always made of vinyl, but cut at rpm. Shorter transcriptions were often cut at 78rpm.|$|E
5000|$|Tiny Mix Tapes Simon Chandler was {{initially}} {{critical of the}} album, saying that while it maintained [...] "the band's adherence to Spartan instrumentation, minimalist structures, and a brutally dry approach … it doesn’t throw up too many surprises." [...] Chandler later wrote positively about {{the consistency of the}} album and noted that it [...] "doesn't suffer from any missteps or indulgences" [...] of <b>Shellac's</b> prior releases, such as Terraform (1998). He ultimately rated the album four out of five stars.|$|R
5000|$|Come Pick Me Up is {{the seventh}} studio album by Superchunk, {{released}} in 1999. It {{is marked by}} the presence of co-producer Jim O'Rourke, a well-known figure in underground circles. Superchunk drummer Jon Wurster said that O'Rourke was selected because the band wanted someone [...] "coming from a different head-space." [...] O'Rourke helped the band decorate the album with string and horn touches that were not typical of their guitar-based sound. One of the horn players who appeared on the album is another well-known figure in underground circles, <b>Shellac's</b> Bob Weston.|$|R
50|$|Excellent Italian Greyhound is {{the title}} of <b>Shellac's</b> fourth album. It was {{released}} on June 5, 2007. The album's title is a reference to drummer Todd Trainer's Italian Greyhound, Uffizi. The album was recorded at Electrical Audio and mastered at Abbey Road by Steve Rooke. The drawings for Excellent Italian Greyhound were created by Jay Ryan from the band Dianogah. As well as a hand screened obi sleeve surrounding the jacket, there are several pictures taken by Joel Larson. As with 1000 Hurts, the vinyl pressing of the album includes an unmarked CD version at no extra charge (CD and LP+CD releases are similarly priced). The band encourages listeners to purchase the vinyl to hear the record as it was intended.|$|R
25|$|Once {{the wood}} surface is {{prepared}} and stained, the finish is applied. It usually consists of several coats of wax, <b>shellac,</b> drying oil, lacquer, varnish, or paint, and each coat is typically followed by sanding.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{polymeric}} {{materials such as}} <b>shellac,</b> amber, wool, silk and natural rubber {{have been used for}} centuries. A variety of other natural polymers exist, such as cellulose, which is the main constituent of wood and paper.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} or, in some cases, use of {{the following}} substances may result in exposure to n-butanol: artificial leather, butyl esters, rubber cement, dyes, fruit essences, lacquers, motion picture, and photographic films, raincoats, perfumes, pyroxylin plastics, rayon, safety glass, <b>shellac</b> varnish, and waterproofed cloth.|$|E
50|$|Benzyl {{alcohol is}} used as a general solvent for inks, waxes, <b>shellacs,</b> paints, lacquers, and epoxy resin coatings. Thus it can be used in paint strippers, {{especially}} when combined with compatible viscosity enhancers to encourage the mixture to cling to painted surfaces. It is a precursor to a variety of esters, used in the soap, perfume, and flavor industries. It is also used in e-liquid for e-cigarettes to enhance the flavors used. When applied to damaged skin or mucous membranes at a 10% concentration it acts as a local anesthetic and antimicrobial agent, and is sometimes included as a degreaser in rug cleaning products. As a dye solvent, it enhances the process of dying wool, nylon, and leather. It also has use as a photographic developer, and as an insect repellent.|$|R
40|$|REMPI laser mass {{spectrometry}} {{is a combination}} of resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization spectroscopy and time of flight {{mass spectrometry}}, This technique enables the collection of mass specific optical spectra as well as of optically selected mass spectra. Analytes are jet-cooled by entrainment in a molecular beam, and this low temperature gas phase analysis has the benefit of excellent vibronic resolution. Utilizing this method, mass spectrometric analysis of historically relevant samples can be simplified and improved; Optical selection of targets eliminates the need for chromatography while knowledge of a target's gas phase spectroscopy allows for facile differentiation of molecules that are in the aqueous phase considered spectroscopically indistinguishable. These two factors allow smaller sample sizes than commercial MS instruments, which in turn will require less damage to objects of antiquity. We have explored methods to optimize REMPI laser mass spectrometry as an analytical tool to archaeology using theobromine and caffeine as molecular markers in Mesoamerican pottery, and are expanding this approach to the field of art to examine laccaic acid in <b>shellacs...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Brothers Chaps have partnered up {{with rock}} band They Might Be Giants and {{supplied}} animation for a music video of their song [...] "Experimental Film". The creators of Homestar Runner {{spent time with}} the band and wrote songs that have been released on the website as [...] "Puppet Jam", a spin-off of [...] "Puppet Stuff", where Puppet Homestar sings with TMBG. TMBG also wrote the music for Strong Bad Email #99, different town, and the band wrote and vocalized the intro song of the 200th Strong Bad Email. Another group, The Skate Party, helped The Brothers Chaps create [...] "The Cheat Theme Song". The band Y-O-U helped with the Strong Bad Sings and Other Type Hits CD, as well as songs on the strongbad_email.exe DVDs. The Brothers Chaps also employed the services of the a cappella band DaVinci's Notebook to create a theme song for the Old-Timey version of The Cheat, called [...] "Ballad of The Sneak". Matt Chapman provided guest vocals as Strong Bad on The Aquabats' [...] "Pink Pants!" [...] from their 2011 album, Hi-Five Soup!. [...] Strong Bad's voice also appears on <b>Shellac's</b> [...] "Genuine Lulabelle" [...] off the album [...] "Excellent Italian Greyhound" [...] from 2007.|$|R
25|$|Another {{problem with}} <b>shellac</b> {{was that the}} size of the disks tended to be larger because it was limited to 80–100 groove walls per inch before the risk of groove {{collapse}} became too high, whereas vinyl could have up to 260 groove walls per inch.|$|E
25|$|Food boluses (or boli; {{singular}} bolus) {{carry the}} archaic and positive meaning of bezoar, and {{are composed of}} loose aggregates of food items such as seeds, fruit pith, or pits, {{as well as other}} types of items such as <b>shellac,</b> bubble gum, soil, and concretions of some medications.|$|E
25|$|<b>Shellac</b> 78s are brittle, {{and must}} be handled carefully. In {{the event of a}} 78 breaking, the pieces might remain loosely {{connected}} by the label and still be playable if the label holds them together, although there is a loud pop with each pass over the crack, and breaking of the stylus is likely.|$|E
40|$|There are {{approximately}} 600, 000 paint spray {{workers in the}} United States applying paints and coatings with some type of sprayer. Approximately 5 % of these spray workers are in the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). These spray workers apply paints or other coatings to products such as bridges, houses, automobiles, wood and metal furniture, and other consumer and industrial products. The materials being sprayed include exterior and interior paints, lacquers, primers, <b>shellacs,</b> stains and varnishes. Our experimental findings indicate that the Airjacket does not significantly reduce the exposure of spray workers to paint fumes during HVLP spraying. The difference between ideal and actual spray paint procedures influence the mechanisms driving spray workers exposures to paint fumes and influence {{the viability of the}} Airjacket technology. In the ideal procedure, for which the Airjacket was conceived, the spray worker's exposure to paint fumes is due largely to the formation of a recirculating eddy between the spray worker and the object painted. The Airjacket ejects air to diminish and ventilate this eddy. In actual practice, exposures may result largely from directing paint upstream and from the bounce-back of the air/paint jet of the object being painted. The Airjacket, would not be expected to dramatically reduce exposures to paint fumes when the paint is not directed downstream or when the bounce-back of paint on the object creates a cloud of paint aerosols around the spray worker...|$|R
25|$|<b>Shellac</b> {{should be}} {{considered}} in two different ways. It is used thinned with denatured alcohol as a finish and as a way to manipulate the wood's ability to absorb other finishes. The alcohol evaporates almost immediately to yield a finish that will attach to virtually any surface, even glass, and virtually any other finish can be used over it.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} World War II began, major labels were experimenting with {{laminated}} records. As stated above, {{and in several}} record advertisements of the period, the materials that make for a quiet surface (<b>shellac)</b> are notoriously weak and brittle. Conversely the materials that make for a strong disc (cardboard and other fiber products) are not those known for allowing a quiet noise-free surface.|$|E
25|$|Both the {{microgroove}} LP rpm {{record and}} the 45rpm single records are made from vinyl plastic that is flexible and unbreakable in normal use, {{even when they are}} sent through the mail with care from one place to another. The vinyl records, however, are easier to scratch or gouge, and much more prone to warping compared to most 78rpm records, which were made of <b>shellac.</b>|$|E
25|$|This type of resin is {{typically}} used post-1930s {{and is an}} indication of modern conservation work. Generally epoxy is very hard but unlike <b>shellac</b> is not brittle. The color of epoxy resin can range from yellow/green to a dark yellow/brown. Yellowing of the resin {{is an indication of}} aging. Warm to hot water or acetone are known to be the solvents of this adhesive.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} the Second World War and the {{resultant}} shortage of <b>shellac</b> for production of records led to most labels cutting back on releases. The York Brothers were trimmed from the Decca roster after releasing six sides, although their popularity in the Midwest and South remained strong. They began performing with an expanded group and released several records on the Detroit-based Mellow label. By the start of 1944, however, both brothers were in the Navy, with George serving in the Pacific and Leslie in Europe.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s Rhino Records {{issued a}} series of boxed sets of 78rpm reissues of early rock and roll hits, {{intended}} for owners of vintage jukeboxes. The records were made of vinyl, however, {{and some of the}} earlier vintage 78rpm jukeboxes and record players (the ones that were pre-war) were designed with heavy tone arms to play the hard slate-impregnated <b>shellac</b> records of their time. These vinyl Rhino 78's were softer and would be destroyed by old juke boxes and old record players, but play very well on newer 78-capable turntables with modern lightweight tone arms and jewel needles.|$|E
25|$|As {{time passed}} and the method moved more into the {{mainstream}} some disagreement arose as to {{the problems associated with}} cutting off air to skin contact, and also some improvements were made. Eventually Pirogov's method gave way to Mathijsen's. Among the improvements suggested as early as 1860 was that of making the dressing resistant to water by painting the dried plaster of Paris with a mixture of <b>shellac</b> dissolved in alcohol. The first commercial bandages were not produced until 1931 in Germany, and were called Cellona. Before that the bandages were made by hand at the hospitals.|$|E
25|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1920s, the Scranton Button Company (founded in 1885 and a major maker of <b>shellac</b> buttons) {{became one of the}} primary makers of {{phonograph}} records. They pressed records for Emerson (whom they bought in 1924), as well as Regal, Cameo, Romeo, Banner, Domino, Conqueror. In July 1929, the company merged with Regal, Cameo, Banner, and the U.S. branch of Pathe (makers of Pathe and Perfect) to become the American Record Corporation. By 1938, the Scranton company was also pressing records for Brunswick, Melotone, and Vocalion. In 1946, the company was acquired by Capitol Records, which continued to produce phonograph records {{through the end of the}} vinyl era.|$|E
