Allocated payments (including merit pay and profit sharing) appear to shift doctors ’ practice to meet targets (e. g. population coverage, reduced spending) while generating possible perverse effects (e. g. emphasis on quantity vs. quality).

40|$|Artículo científico [...] Universidad de Costa Rica. Instituto de Investigaciones en Salud, 1986 The Republic of San Marino (RSM) {{is a small}} {{independent}} {{nation on}} the Italian peninsula located within the Emilia-Romagna region near the Adriatic sea. The population in 1980 was 21500. Until 1950 the economy was essentially based on agriculture, but since 1950 {{there has been a}} noticeable development of tourism. Traditions and ancient laws have increased the isolation of people living in the RSM and the population still shows characteristics of 'genetic segregation'. In 1949 Suzzi-Valli noted the possible relationship between this phenomenon and mortality rates for neoplasms.

40|$|Emerging {{technologies}} such as smart cards, electronic cash and the Internet have been heralded as {{the next step in}} the evolution of money laundering. Australian and international law enforcement agencies have however, found little evidence that these new technologies are being used in this way. Legislation and law enforcement capabilities need to be developed to deal with emerging technologies that can be used to launder money. The techniques used to launder money in 1999 – 2000 were much the same as those used in previous years. There is, however, a change in how the methods are being used to avoid detection. Concern about the use of alternative remittance and underground banking systems is growing. Australia is an attractive ‘host ’ country for these systems because of factors such as the multiplicity of ethnic backgrounds represented in the population, the nation’s developed status, and its advanced financial sector. If the effectiveness of asset confiscation in Australia is to be measured, national uniform guidelines for <b>statistical</b> <b>recording</b> of asset confiscation are necessary.

40|$|The {{so-called}} Environmental Sector produces technologies, {{products and}} services that prevent or reduce environmental damages. On the background of growing environmental problems such as climate protection this sector {{seems to be more}} and more important. Contrary to that, a theoretical model shows that this hypothesis may not be true for all sections of the environmental sector. End-of-pipe solutions that operate independently from production processes are mostly driven by environmental regulation so that the demand for these products reacts rather inelastic. This may not be the case for cleaner technologies that are in most cases an integrated part of the production process. Cost-savings are a major motivation to introduce these technologies and products. Unfortunately, the <b>statistical</b> <b>recording</b> of cleaner technologies is very problematic because these technologies or products can not easily be identified separately. This is also the case for our empirical analysis using data from the establishment panel of the Institute for Employment Research. Our analysis of structural change shows a drastic decline of the number of firms and employment in environmental sectors dominated by end-of-pipe but there are positive employment developments and expectations for those cleaner technologies that are captured by our data. This observation is confirmed by an econometric analysis explaining the driving forces of the market shares of firms in the environmental sector.

40|$|High {{performance}} modern tennis is characterised by high dynamism, {{speed in}} thinking and action, precision and high technical and tactical skills. In this study, we used direct observation and <b>statistical</b> <b>recording</b> of nine matches during two competition {{years in the}} tennis players Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andre Agassi. In these tennis players, we studied mainly the return of serve, {{one of the most}} important shots in tennis, together with serve, as first shots in a point. We have chosen the three tennis players because they are the best example of return of serve as shown by the matches recorded and interpreted. The study we have carried out shows that return of serve makes Agassi a winner in most matches. The high percentage in Federer’s serves makes his adversaries have a lower percentage in return of serve, which prevents them to win against his serve. High percentage in return of serve results in more points on the adversary’s serve and an opportunity to start the offensive point. After comparing the three tennis players mentioned above, we can see that the highest percentage of points won on return of serve belongs to Agassi, which ranks him among the best return of serve tennis players in the world. The tennis player with the highest percentage in return of service is the one who wins the match, which shows, once again, the importance of the return of serve. Return of serve can be a strong counter-attack weapon if used at its highest level...|$|E

40|$|Cash pooling is a {{bank service}} that allows {{corporates}} to externalise the intra-group cash management, and thus manage their global liquidity effectively with lower costs. Although {{there is little}} quantitative information on {{the significance of the}} phenomenon, cash pooling appears to have become increasingly popular after the onset of the financial crisis when, in an environment characterised by limited access to capital markets, reduced bank lending, low returns and higher risks on banks' deposits, corporate groups started to maximise their use of internal sources of financing. In particular, cash pooling is currently very relevant in Western and Northern European countries, and is mainly offered in the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands. This paper first analyses cash pooling agreements with a focus on the aspects that are relevant from a statistical viewpoint. It then addresses their <b>statistical</b> <b>recording</b> in compliance with ESA 2010 and, specifically, the methodological framework of Monetary Financial Institutions (MFI) balance sheet item statistics. It is proposed that positions related to cash pooling shall be recorded on a gross basis vis- 0 -vis the actual beneficiaries and obligors of the corresponding accounts. However, the proposed treatment goes beyond MFI balance sheet statistics and affects other data domains as well, ranging from financial accounts to balance of payments and international investment positions. While the statistical approach may seem straightforward, applying it in practice is more difficult, not least because of the treatment of cash pooling contracts in accounting terms. The analysis is complemented by numerical examples and also includes data for the Netherlands, which show the importance of clarifying the statistical treatment of cash pooling in light of the large impact it may have on macroeconomic aggregates...|$|E

Also comparison of parameters of technological effectiveness of the extracting and processing sectors of economy of Russia and the USA is made. The carried-out calculations testify to repeatedly lagging behind absolute values of a technical structure of the equity in industries of the processing economy sector, and also to availability of a technology gap between extracting and processing sectors of the Russian economy.

40|$|This study defines various fiscal {{indicators}} for different analytical purposes, adjusting for the distorting effect of creative accounting. It presents these indicators using {{the example of}} Hungary. The study abandons the general view that an identical balance is produced from the two traditional definitions of the general government deficit, as deficit indicators resulting from the flow of funds calculated as the balance of revenues and expenditures (above the line) and changes in financial assets and liabilities (below the line) may vary. Firstly, {{the treatment of the}} loss of contributions transferred to private pension funds causes a difference, as in contrast to a tax cut, this does not constitute a flow of funds, but nevertheless increases the amount of public debt. Secondly, while accrualbased accounting is justified for defining assets and liabilities, accrual-based and cash-flow recording may be applied in relation to flow of funds, depending on which is more appropriate for estimating the effect or fiscal impulse on the economy. Accrual-based accounting adjusts fluctuations in cash-flow recording, but it identifies the economic impact only if there are neither liquidity constraints nor unexpected fiscal measures in the economy. In this case namely, the economic agents do not react to cash-flow fluctuations. If, however, the economic agents are either subject to liquidity constraints or unexpected measures are taken, they are also affected by the sudden changes in cash-flows. Contrary to conventions, the study draws a distinction between the two types of deficit indicators through the introduction of different terms. It continues to define the indicator identifying flow of funds as deficit, while it terms changes in assets and liabilities as a financing requirement. On the one side, the indicator defined as deficit constitutes the basis of the calculation of the impact on the economy and external balance (‘impulse’). The composition of this fiscal impulse plays a decisive role, particularly the impulse on households and changes in indirect taxes. On the other side, the analysis of the financing requirement – that is, changes in assets and liabilities – provides the basis for determining which revenues and expenditures are deemed to be temporary and which are of a permanent (‘underlying’) nature. The study determines the categories of the augmented deficit, indicating flow of funds, and the augmented financing requirement, measuring changes in financial assets and liabilities, {{on the basis of the}} IMF method for filtering the effects of creative accounting. <b>Statistical</b> <b>recording,</b> namely, needs to be augmented with the financial requirement of organisations conducting quasi-fiscal operations and the simultaneously accumulating quasi-fiscal debt. The ‘one-off’ capital transfer related to the subsequent assumption of this quasi-fiscal debt needs to be filtered out. In our experience, the augmented deficit has advantage of being consistent in a macroeconomic sense and methodologically more stable than the statistical deficit, as the latter frequently requires revisions. Naturally, the actual figures of the augmented deficit may change to a certain degree, as the analytical adjustments need to augment data with estimates in the case of the quasi-fiscal operations and creative accounting. As a favourable change in relation to the data requirement, from 2010 theofficial budget accounting includes public investments which are statistically recorded as private investments. cyclical adjustment, creative accounting, fiscal impulse, structural (underlying) deficit...|$|E
