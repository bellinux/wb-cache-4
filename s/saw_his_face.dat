5|$|Back in London, the Claimant {{employed}} a solicitor, John Holmes, {{who agreed to}} go with him to Paris to meet Lady Tichborne. This meeting took place on 11 January at the Hôtel de Lille. As soon as she <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> Lady Tichborne accepted him. At Holmes's behest she lodged with the British Embassy a signed declaration formally testifying that the Claimant was her son. She was unmoved when Father Châtillon, Roger's childhood tutor, declared the Claimant an impostor, and she allowed Holmes to inform The Times in London that she had recognised Roger. She settled an income of £1,000 a year on him, and accompanied him to England to declare her support before the more sceptical members of the Tichborne family.|$|E
25|$|In their rooms, Raoul expresses disgust {{that their}} host would send circus freaks to receive them ("What a Dreadful Town!..."). He upsets Gustave {{by refusing to}} play with him and storms out to find a bar, leaving Christine to explain his {{behavior}} to their son ("Look With Your Heart"). When Gustave goes to bed, the Phantom enters and reveals to a stunned Christine that {{it was he who}} summoned her to sing at Phantasma. Initially outraged, Christine eventually succumbs to the memory of a clandestine evening the two shared before she was married. As they recall their one night of passion, it is revealed that Christine was prepared to abandon Raoul for the Phantom, but awoke in the morning to find herself alone. The Phantom explains that he fled out of fear that she would reject him again when she <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> in the morning light ("Beneath a Moonless Sky"). Both concede that they once thought their love had a chance, but the circumstances of the present day make it impossible ("Once Upon Another Time"). They are startled by a scream from Gustave, who awakens from a nightmare and rushes into the room. Christine introduces the Phantom as an old friend named Mr. Y, and he promises to show the boy around Phantasma the next day ("Mother Please, I'm Scared!").|$|E
500|$|At this time, Archduke Charles {{was in his}} {{twenties and}} {{did not expect to}} become emperor for some time, {{especially}} while Franz Ferdinand remained in good health. This changed on 28 June 1914 when the heir and his wife Sophie were assassinated in Sarajevo by Bosnian Serb nationalists. Charles and Zita received the news by telegram that day. She said of her husband, [...] "Though it was a beautiful day, I <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> go white in the sun.|$|E

2500|$|The {{police and}} {{prosecution}} maintained that he cable tied her hands {{behind her back}} in the bedroom in preparation for rape, and then used a cable tie as a ligature to murder her when her blindfold slipped and she <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> When asked why he had abducted Tiernan, he replied: [...] "I have no idea". When police challenged his version of taking the body to Lindley Woods soon after the murder, he claimed that he had first kept the body hidden underneath pallets in his back garden, and then stored her inside his sofa.|$|E
2500|$|After waiting, Roller {{testified that}} the then robbed the Hi-Way Check Cashing Service. [...] A customer, Colin McCormick {{identified}} Roller, {{but was unable to}} reliably identify Landano, stating that he never <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> [...] The owner, Jacob Roth, and his son, Jonathan, also testified. [...] Jacob stated that when the business was being robbed, he activated the silent alarm and [...] "hit the deck", never looking up as the robbers took the cash. [...] He tentatively identified Landano, saying that he [...] "resembled" [...] one of the robbers. [...] Jonathan also identified Landano with uncertainty, noting that he only saw the robber for a second or two. [...] John De Maritz, another customer, testified that Roller was the individual that entered the business and that he heard shots from outside.|$|E
2500|$|Resistance when {{it first}} began {{in the summer of}} 1940 was based upon what the writer Jean Cassou called refus absurde ("absurd refusal") of refusing to accept that the Reich would win and even if it did, it was better to resist. Many résistants often spoke of some [...] "climax" [...] when they saw some {{intolerable}} act of injustice, after which they could not longer remain passive. The résistant Joseph Barthelet told the British SOE agent George Miller that his [...] "climax" [...] occurred when he saw the German military police march into the Feldgendarmerie in Metz a group of Frenchmen, one of whom was a friend. Barthelt recalled: [...] "I recognized him only by his hat. Only by his hat, I tell you and because I was waiting on the roadside to see him pass. I <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> all right, but there was no skin on it, and he could not see me. Both his poor eyes had been closed into two purple and yellow bruises". The right-wing résistant Henri Frenay who had initially sympathized with the Révolution nationale stated that when he saw the German soldiers in Paris in the summer of 1940, he knew he had do to something to uphold French honor because of the look of contempt he saw on the faces of the Germans when viewing the French. In the beginning, resistance was limited to activities such as severing phone lines, vandalizing posters and slashing tyres on German vehicles. Another form of resistance was underground newspapers like Musée de l'Homme (Museum of Mankind) which circulated clandestinely. The Musée de l'Homme was founded by two professors, Paul Rivet and the Russian émigré Boris Vildé in July 1940. In the same month, July 1940 Jean Cassou founded a resistance group in Paris while the liberal Catholic law professor François de Menthon founded the group Liberté in Lyon.|$|E
