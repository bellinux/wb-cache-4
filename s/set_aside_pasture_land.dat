25|$|It was {{originally}} an area <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> as communal <b>pasture</b> by Albany's city council {{in the late}} 17th century and deeded to the Dutch Reformed Church. As the city began to grow following its designation as New York's state capital a century later, it was subdivided into building lots, {{some of which were}} developed with small rowhouses. Many open areas remain today, and the houses have not been significantly altered. In 1972 the city designated it as a historic district and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. All but two buildings in the district are considered historic.|$|R

The <b>pasture</b> <b>land</b> where Ratner's cattle roamed and the since broken up runways where military flight crews trained has been divided into some 152,000 0.25 acre and 0.5 acre lots for housing, along over 1,400 miles of roads. Strips of land along major thoroughfares, such as Homestead Road and Lee Boulevard, were <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> for commerce. In 1997, nearly 90% of Lehigh Acres' lots remained vacant.|$|R

40|$|In {{this report}} microeconometric methods {{are applied to}} explain the {{voluntary}} <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> of arable land of Austrian farms. The descriptive {{analysis of the data}} shows {{that the majority of the}} small scale farms do not <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> arable land. But if they do <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> land, they <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> substantial shares. The microeconometric estimations confirm that the decision to <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> consists of two steps. The first step is whether to <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> at all and the second step is how much to <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b> The type of a farm has the biggest effect on the decision. Soil quality, the distribution of the soil quality, off farm work and the participation in the ÖPUL-program have significant, but generally small, influence as well. The results vary somewhat for different major production areas. If the two step model is used to calculate the expected <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> of a farm, it generally is low as farms have low probabilities to <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b> Most of the farms under the general regulation <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> small shares of arable land. That is due to the fact that every <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> that is more than the mandatory 10 percent is defined a voluntary <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b> Therefore, unfortunately, the statistical estimations are almost impossible to render and hence <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> is not as well explained by the model for farms under the general regulation as for the small scale farms. The main conclusion of the research is that there were no factors that lead to massive <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b> This can be interpreted as a sign that cultivating arable land generally still pays in Austria. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} a systematic global review {{of differences between}} timber plantations and <b>pasture</b> <b>lands</b> in terms of animal and plant species richness and abundance, and assessed the results using meta-analysis techniques. Our principal aim was {{to test the hypothesis}} that plantations contain higher species richness or abundance than pasture. Of the 1967 studies of potential relevance, 66 provided biological monitoring information and 36 met the requirements for meta-analyses. Sufficient data were available for meta-analyses to be conducted comparing the species richness and abundance of plantations and <b>pasture</b> <b>lands</b> for five taxonomic groups: plants, invertebrates, reptiles/amphibians, mammals, and birds. Within each taxon there was considerable variation in the difference between species richness and abundance between plantations and <b>pasture</b> <b>lands.</b> Birds and reptile/amphibians exhibited significantly higher species richness, and mammals exhibited significantly higher abundance, in plantations than in <b>pasture</b> <b>lands</b> which lacked remnant vegetation. Reptile/amphibian species richness was significantly higher in plantations in general. No significant differences in species richness were found for mammals, plants, or invertebrates, and no significant differences in abundance were found for birds, reptiles/amphibians, invertebrates, or plants. It is only within the presence of taxonomic caveats (i. e. reptiles/amphibians), or specific landscape features (i. e. absence of remnant vegetation within pasture), that it can be concluded that plantations support higher species richness or abundance than <b>pasture</b> <b>land.</b> We emphasize that caution is warranted when making general statements about the inherent biodiversity value of diverse and broadly-defined land-uses...|$|R
