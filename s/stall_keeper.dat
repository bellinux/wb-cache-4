This was now bustling with passengers; the train for Liverpool {{was just about to}} start, another had but recently arrived; and the double tide made movement difficult. As the pair reached the neighbourhood of the bookstall, however, they came into an open space; and here the attention of the plotter was attracted by a Standard broadside bearing the words: ‘Second Edition: Explosion in Golden Square.’ His eye lighted; groping in his pocket for the necessary coin, he sprang forward—his bag knocked sharply {{on the corner of the}} stall—and instantly, with a formidable report, the dynamite exploded. When the smoke cleared away the stall was seen much shattered, and the <b>stall</b> <b>keeper</b> running forth in terror from the ruins; but of the Irish patriot or the Gladstone bag no adequate remains were to be found.|$|E

50|$|The {{town has}} two small {{supermarkets}} (Proxy Market and 8 à huit) {{and a range}} of typical shops such as butcher, baker, fishmonger, and newsagent. The town has an indoor market, open Thursdays and Saturdays off season and every day during the summer. Many local shop <b>keepers</b> have a <b>stall</b> in the market. Due to the proximity of the fishing fleet at Dives-sur-Mer, fishmongers and market <b>stall</b> <b>keepers</b> sell fresh seafood, usually harvested in the early morning (depending on the tide).|$|R
50|$|At ennichi {{or summer}} festival stalls, {{the game is}} not a competition. Participation {{typically}} costs around 100 yen and players can take the scooped goldfish home in a special bag provided by the <b>stall</b> <b>keeper.</b> The game is unlimited, so players can scoop until their pois are completely broken. If they cannot scoop any goldfish, the <b>stall</b> <b>keeper</b> may be kind enough to give them one or two free goldfish. Each stall usually has its own rules. For example, there are some stalls where players can get a stronger poi if they pay more. Other stalls give players special presents if they scoop a lot. In some variations, there are also medaka (Japanese killifish) that are faster and harder to catch than goldfish. Usually, for every four goldfish, there is one medaka, so in ennichi, if you catch one, it counts as four goldfish.|$|E

Niño of Pagadian, a great fire brought {{disaster}} on the first year of this decade. About a hundred houses and commercial establishments were burned down but luckily, no one was hurt. This caused an economic breakdown of the municipality as it was estimated to cost 2 million of the properties lost. Aid from the government through DSWD and some NGOs helped the townsfolk stand again from the ashes.|$|R

5000|$|In 1871 {{a writer}} for The Australasian {{recalled}} {{the early years of}} the market in less than flattering terms:""It was originally a dreary waste with an ugly looking gaol shrinking away in the farthest corner of it, as if ashamed both of its purpose and of its appearance. Then hawkers, miscellaneous dealers, and houseless new arrivals pitched their tents upon it, and spread their motley merchandise along the edge of the footpath to allure the attention of passers-by. One summer morning as I turned out of Spring-street into Bourke-street I saw a whiff of flame spring from one of the tents and flash from end to end with inconceivable rapidity. It is no exaggeration to say that by the time I reached Stephen-street the encampment was a heap of ruins, and the owners of the tents were surveying their blackened ite with such a look of incredulity and amazement that there was quite as much of the ludicrous as of the pathetic in the incident.After this, I think, no more tents were suffered to be erected; but hay and corn factors set up their sentry-boxes on the scene of the fire; and then <b>stall</b> <b>keepers</b> were permitted to utilise the vacant ground; and there might be found the strangest assortment of damaged provisions to be met with outside of the New Cut, the Whitechapel-road or the High-street, Shoreditch. There were cheeses strong enough to waft their odour to Carlton, dried fruits that had been honeycombed by insects, salt fish of perdurable toughness, tins of jam and bottles of pickles with the shabbiest of anonymous labels, sides of bacon of wonderful antiquity, and a conglomerate of so-called dates which appeared to have been cemented together with paste blacking. Who bought those things? And, oh! by whom were they consumed? Sometimes I fancy that the vendors, finding no market for such unconsidered trifles, were driven to consume them themselves, and so perished miserably." ...|$|R
25|$|Soon {{after that}} first event, the Highland Games began being held at the Basin Reserve. The games were {{organised}} by the Wellingtonian Caledonian Society, of which their headquarters, The Caledonian Hotel, still stands towards {{the south of the}} Basin Reserve. The society offered up prize money which brought many competitors to the region. Due to their success, the society petitioned to have new grandstands built at the western end of the Basin Reserve. They would measure 44ft by 20ft and would cost approximately £250–£300. The stands would also hold food <b>stalls</b> and ground <b>keepers.</b> However, for the following years, even up until reportedly 1872, the Basin Reserve grounds were still extremely swampy, with small pools of swamp water and various weeds and shrubs sprouting over the fields. In late 1872, horses were used {{to level the playing field}} and this greatly improved the conditions.|$|R
