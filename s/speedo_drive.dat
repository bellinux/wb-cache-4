The Rekord bodywork was slightly altered to accommodate the different grille. The steering was also from Vauxhall, as was the suspension, which gave the car a somewhat wider track than the Opel. Early cars came in for some criticism {{as some of the}} parts did not quite match up; for instance, while the car's gearing was raised, the <b>speedo</b> <b>drive</b> was unchanged, causing grossly inaccurate readings. The brand was discontinued after only a few years. The engines were referred to by their displacement in cubic inches, part of an attempt of differentiating the car from its Opel counterpart. There were the 130, the 153, and the 153HC (high compression) to choose from, with the more powerful SS version added later.|$|E
