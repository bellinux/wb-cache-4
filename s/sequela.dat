40|$|Abstract The {{development}} of paediatric intensive care {{has contributed to}} the improved survival of critically ill children. Physical and psychological <b>sequelae</b> and consequences for quality of life (QoL) in survivors might be significant, as has been determined in adult intensive care unit (ICU) survivors. Awareness of <b>sequelae</b> due to the original illness and its treatment may result in changes in treatment and support during and after the acute phase. To determine the current knowledge on physical and psychological <b>sequelae</b> and {{the quality of life in}} survivors of paediatric intensive care, we undertook a computerised comprehensive search of online databases for studies reporting <b>sequelae</b> in survivors of paediatric intensive care. Studies reporting <b>sequelae</b> in paediatric survivors of cardiothoracic surgery and trauma were excluded, as were studies reporting only mortality. All other studies reporting aspects of physical and psychological <b>sequelae</b> were analysed. Twenty-seven studies consisting of 3, 444 survivors met the selection criteria. Distinct physical and psychological <b>sequelae</b> in patients have been determined and seemed to interfere with quality of life. Psychological <b>sequelae</b> in parents seem to be common. Small numbers, methodological limitations and quantitative and qualitative heterogeneity hamper the interpretation of data. We conclude that paediatric intensive care survivors and their parents have physical and psychological <b>sequelae</b> affecting quality of life. Further well-designed prospective studies evaluating <b>sequelae</b> of the original illness and its treatment are warranted...|$|R

40|$|Cerebral malaria (CM) in {{children}} {{is associated with}} a high mortality and long-term neurocognitive <b>sequelae.</b> Both erythropoietin (Epo) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) {{have been shown to be}} neuroprotective.

Prospective study in 624 children admitted with cerebral malaria to two hospitals in The Gambia, West Africa.

40|$|Background and aim. During childhood, elbow {{frames are}} the {{fractures}} which {{are most likely}} to cause subsequent complications. Not all the complications observed are followed by <b>sequelae</b> provided treatment is adequate. The most common <b>sequelae</b> are those affecting the bone (axial deviations, joint restriction, etc.) followed in the long term by the <b>sequelae</b> of vasculo-nervous lesions. It is important not to understimate ingravescent nervous damage caused by the progressive stretching of the ulnar nerve due to valgus deviation of the elbow. Methods.

40|$|Abstract Background This is a {{long-term}} follow-up clinical study of adolescents and adults, survivors of childhood cancer. We evaluate and analyze the late somatic <b>sequelae</b> of childhood cancer treatment. Many such studies are susceptible to a strong selection bias, i. e., they employ a limited non-systematic sample of patients, based on a clinical hospital that provided the cancer treatment or performed the follow-up. To {{address the issue of}} selection bias, we perform here an analysis of late <b>sequelae</b> on a systematic database of the entire population of the children treated for cancer in Slovenia. Due to the specifics of cancer treatment procedures in Slovenia, they have all been treated and followed-up in the same clinic. Methods The data are based on the centralized registry of cancer patients in Slovenia and present a controlled and homogeneous collection. Late <b>sequelae</b> are evaluated following a modified CTCAE, i. e., the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3. 0. We use survival analysis method to estimate the incidence of and risk for late <b>sequelae,</b> where the time variable is measured in years from the diagnosis date, while we follow the event of incidence of late <b>sequelae</b> scored other than none. Survival analysis is performed using KaplanMeier estimator and Cox regression model. Results The incidence of mild, moderate, or severe late <b>sequelae</b> of childhood cancer treatment significantly decreased from 75 % in the group of patients diagnosed before 1975 to 55 % for those diagnosed after 1995. The Cox regression analysis of the risk factors for the incidence of late <b>sequelae</b> identifies three significant factors: treatment modalities, age at diagnosis, and primary diagnosis. Conclusions The change of treatment modalities in terms of replacement of surgery and radiotherapy with chemotherapy is the main reason for the decrease of the incidence and the risk for late <b>sequelae</b> of childhood cancer treatment; treatment modalities including surgery significantly increase the risk ratio of late <b>sequelae,</b> while those based on chemotherapy only significantly decreases the risk. Risk of late <b>sequelae</b> increases with the diagnosis age: younger children are more susceptible to late effects of treatment. Finally, primary diagnosis significantly influences the risk for late <b>sequelae,</b> but mostly due to the dependency of the treatment modality on the primary diagnosis. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{retrospective}} study aimed at determining the predicted risks of clinical and radiographic complications in primary teeth following traumatic dental injuries, according to injury type, severity and child’s age. Data {{were collected from}} records of children treated at a Dental Trauma Center in Brazil for nine years. Records of 576 children were included; clinical <b>sequelae</b> were assessed in 774 teeth, and radiographic <b>sequelae,</b> in 566 teeth. A total of 408 teeth (52. 7 %) had clinical <b>sequelae</b> and 185 teeth (32. 7 %), radiographic <b>sequelae.</b> The type of injury with {{the highest number of}} clinical <b>sequelae</b> was the crown-root fracture (86. 4 %). Clinical <b>sequelae</b> increased with injury severity (p < 0. 001), whereas radiographic <b>sequelae</b> did not (0. 236). The predicted risk of color change was 29. 0 % (95 %CI 19 – 41) for teeth with enamel fracture, and 26. 0 % (95 %CI 14 – 40) for teeth with enamel dentin fracture as well as enamel dentin pulp fracture. Risk of periapical radiolucency was higher for teeth with enameldentinpulp fracture (61. 1 % 95 %CI 35 – 82) and those with subluxation (15. 8 % 95 %CI 10 – 22). Risk of premature loss was 27. 3 % (95 %CI 13 – 45) for teeth with extrusive luxation, and 10. 2 % (95 %CI 5 – 17) for those with intrusive luxation. The assessment of predicted risks of <b>sequelae</b> showed that teeth with hard tissue trauma tended to present color change, periapical radiolucency and premature loss, whereas teeth with supporting tissue trauma showed color change, abnormal position, premature loss and periapical radiolucency as the most common <b>sequelae.</b> Knowledge about the predicted risks of complications may help clinicians establish appropriate treatment plans...|$|R
