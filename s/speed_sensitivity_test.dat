40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the affecting factors and to build the predicating model of sensitivity in Luxiang depression, this paper firstly analyzes the sensitivity results and some parameters, including porosity, permeability, contents of different kinds of clay minerals tested in laboratory. Then it analyzes the relationship between sensitivity and porosity, permeability, contents of different kinds of clay minerals, throat type, and the distribution of clay minerals, integrated with the lab methods, such as core casting slices, microscope scanning, etc. Next, parameter prediction models are built by relating with sedimentary facies and depth. The porosity, permeability, contents of different clays, contents of quartz and feldspar were predicted based on these models which were used for sensitivity prediction. At last, sensitivity predicating models are built for <b>speed</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> water sensitivity, acid sensitivity and alkali sensitivity using Elman neural network. Results show that the Elman is efficient in sensitivity prediction; there are strong <b>speed</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> acid sensitivity, alkali sensitivity and salt sensitivity in Wuxing structural zone; whereas there is strong <b>speed</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in the center and northwest of Luxiang depression...|$|R

40|$|Motion {{in depth}} can be {{perceived}} from binocular cues alone, {{yet it is}} unclear whether these cues support <b>speed</b> <b>sensitivity</b> {{in the absence of the}} monocular cues that normally co-occur in natural viewing. We measure threshold contours in space-time for the discrimination of three-dimensional (3 D) motion to determine whether observers use speed to discriminate a test 3 D motion from two identical standards. We compare thresholds for random-dot stereograms (RDS) containing both binocular cues to 3 D motion-interocular velocity difference and changing disparity over time-with performance for dynamic random-dot stereograms (DRDS), which contain only the second cue. Threshold contours are tilted along the axis of constant velocity in space-time for RDS stimuli at slow speeds (0. 5 m/s), evidence for <b>speed</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> However, for higher speeds (1. 5 m/s) and DRDS stimuli, observers rely on the component cues of duration and disparity. In a second experiment, noise of constant velocity is added to the standards to degrade the reliability of these separate components. Again there is evidence for speed tuning for RDS, but not for DRDS. Considerable variation is observed in the ability of individual observers to use the different cues in both experiments, however, in general the results emphasize the importance of interocular velocity difference as a critical cue for <b>speed</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to motion in depth, and suggest that <b>speed</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to stereomotion from binocular cues is restricted to relatively slow speeds. 16 page(s...|$|R

Materials and Methods: We investigated the paradoxical effect of caspofungin and micafungin on the growth and cell viability of 38 clinical isolates of Candida albicans using a microbial <b>sensitivity</b> <b>test</b> and growth curve methodology. Results: When cells were incubated in the presence of antifungal agents for 48 h, the paradoxical effect was observed in 50 % and 47. 4 % of the isolates incubated with caspofungin and micafungin, respectively. Growth curves indicated the occurrence of the paradoxical effect varied between different echinocandins. Moreover, increased turbidity in the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>test</b> did not correlate with increased fungal cell growth. For caspofungin, the paradoxical effect appeared earlier than in the microbial <b>sensitivity</b> <b>test,</b> while for micafungin, the effect observed in the microbial <b>sensitivity</b> <b>test</b> was not a true paradoxical effect.

Direct <b>sensitivity</b> <b>tests</b> are attractive because they involve only one stage of handling (i. e. cultures need not be set up), are simpler and less expensive, and consume less time. Although the direct <b>sensitivity</b> <b>test</b> introduced by Middlebrook and co-workers (Middlebrook and Cohn, 1958; Russell and Middlebrook, 1961) using 7 H 10 agar medium yielded satisfactory results, it has certain disadvantages.
