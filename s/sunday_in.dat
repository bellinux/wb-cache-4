5|$|Start and end dates {{vary with}} {{location}} and year. Since 1996, European Summer Time {{has been observed}} from the last <b>Sunday</b> <b>in</b> March to the last <b>Sunday</b> <b>in</b> October; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union. Starting in 2007, most of the United States and Canada observe DST from the second <b>Sunday</b> <b>in</b> March to the first <b>Sunday</b> <b>in</b> November, almost two-thirds of the year. The 2007 U.S. change {{was part of the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005; previously, from 1987 through 2006, the start and end dates were the first <b>Sunday</b> <b>in</b> April and the last <b>Sunday</b> <b>in</b> October, and Congress retains the right {{to go back to the}} previous dates now that an energy-consumption study has been done. Proponents for permanently retaining November as the month for ending DST point to Halloween as a reason to delay the change—to provide extra daylight on October 31.|$|E
