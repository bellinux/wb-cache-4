50|$|The veiltail, a name {{coined by}} William T. Innes, {{originated}} in the United States in the 1890s when Franklin Barrett of Philadelphia crossed a Japanese-bred fringetail ryukin to a telescope eye goldfish that exhibited a short, square-edged caudal. According to William Seale this fringetail {{was one of many}} imported by the Wisconsin State Fish Commission for the World's Fair. However, these fish became sick with fungus and were not shown in the 1893 fair. Mr. Seale saved 5 or 6 of these fish and returned home to Philadelphia with them. Mr. Seale then sold one of these fish to Franklin Barrett for $15 and this was the fish Barrett used to cross to a short but square tailed telescope eye goldfish. The telescope eye goldfish used for this cross were obtained as imports by John Cugley of Philadelphia. This resulted in a <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> soon to be known throughout the world as Philadelphia veiltails. Although some have suggested that Philadelphia Veiltails died out in America, a man named Al Thomma was able to obtain stock from a John (Andy) W. Anderson of Philadelphia who possessed fish from the original Barrett line. Mr. Anderson worked for Innes Publishing as advertising editor and publisher of The Aquarium Magazine. Through the work of Al Thomma and Al Foster we still have the Philadelphia Veiltail today.|$|E

It consists of two big brood stock tanks and 14 nursery ponds. The total outlay on setting up this hatchery was 3.68 lacks. In beginning the farms activities were limited to meet the seed stocking requirements of Gobind Sagar reservoir, but its targets were increased year to year and research, training, technique and demonstration brought under the farm programmed. During 1978 fish species being record at the farm were demonstrated to the people by constructing a small aquarium and its aim was to apprise the popular. During 1989 a training center and Hostel were constructed within the farm premises so that training course be imparted to the departmental personnel and interested fish farmers. Now training camps are being conducted with modern fish breeding and culture technique training are imparted. This farm has not only historic importance but is can {{be known as a}} center breeding excellent training in fish culture and research programmed. Keeping in view the commendable work done in the field of breeding, the Punjab University extended its recognition for undertaking research work at this farm. The Deoli fish farm has {{played a major role in}} breeding fish population in Gobind Sagar reservoir, income of the reservoir fishermen and their lives prosperous. For the first time Silver Carp fish was stocked in Gobind Sagar reservoir from Deoli farm. Every year 30-40 lacks mirror carp fingerlings are being produced at the farm and these are stocked in Gobind Sagar reservoir and other water bodies in the State and distributed to the private fish farms. Due to regular stocking in Gobind Sagar reservoir for the last decade at has a unique capacity of fish production per hectare in the country and this credit goes to Deoli farm. The scientists of ICAR and State Fisheries Department initiated a joint research project viz. ‘Genetic Rejuvenation of Fish Stock in HP’. The ‘Bio-Science Department’ started this project entire funded about 18.00 lacks. A quality <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> is being reared under this project and distributed to the fish farmers. Under this technique demonstration programme a new scheme namely ‘Fish Culture in Running Water’ was introduced for the first time at the farm. This scheme was observed suitable especially in high altitude of Himachal Pradesh on the basis of success of this technique the Govt of India incorporated this scheme under the Centrally Sponsored Fish Farmers’ Development Agency subsidy programme. The NABARD Bank has also approved this scheme namely ‘Fish Culture in Running Water’ which resulted in setting up of about 1000 units in the State. In recent years sport fisheries is fostering in the Gobind Sagar reservoir which clearly indicates vast potential of attracting tourists. The Deptt regularly organizes angling completions every year. In Gobind Sagar and Mahseer fish which is a famous and most liked fish of the anglers is an important fish of this reservoir. As the breeding of Mahseer fish is not an easy job hence the Punjab University and State Fisheries Department jointly prepared a project of Rs. 19.00 lacks it was got approved from ICAR. Present hatchery set up at the Deoli farm has been constructed under this scheme. Under this scheme matured Mahseer fish would be brought from his habitat and bred in comfortable situation.|$|E

Chemotherapy using antimicrobial agents and criteria is effective but users should {{pay attention to}} avoid the increases of multiple drug resistant <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> pathogenic bacteria. Vaccination by injection, immersion and oral methods is important to prevent diseases. Besides formalin-killed and heat-treated vaccines, {{there are several other}} types of vaccines, such as attenuated, subunit, and DNA vaccines. Fish rely more on their innate immunity to prevent diseases and immunostimulants generally stimulate innate immune components. Many immunostimulants such as glucans, levamisole, chitin, lipopolysaccharides and nucleotides have been reported to increase protection against bacterial, viral and parasitic diseases in fish. Diagnostic methods are indispensable to fish farm management and will help in identifying proper therapeutic measures and preventing the spread of diseases. Diagnostic methods currently used are antibody-based diagnosis, detection of specific genes in the target pathogen by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method. In aquaculture, one way to prevent fish diseases is to develop disease-resistant <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> through the use of marker-assisted selection (MAS). MAS requires an understanding of the linkage between quantitative trait loci of a target trait and DNA markers. Transgenic technology is applicable to obtain disease-resistant <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish.</b> Recent advances in the fish transgenesis for disease-resistance are discussed.

40|$|The toxic {{effects of}} cadmium and other heavy metals {{have been well}} established, {{and many of these}} and other {{environmental}} pollutants are known to be embryotoxic or teratogenic. However, it has proven difficult to identify individual cells that respond to toxicants among the wide range of cell populations in an intact animal, particularly during early development when cells are continually changing their molecular and physiologic characteristics as they differentiate. Here we report the establishment of an in vivo system that uses hsp 70 gene activation as a measure of cadmium toxicity in living early larvae of transgenic zebrafish carrying a stably integrated hsp 70 -enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter gene. We demonstrate that eGFP expression in this <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> acts as an accurate and reproducible indicator of cell-specific induction of hsp 70 gene expression. Furthermore, the transgene responds in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations similar to those observed for morphologic indicators of early-life-stage toxicity and is sensitive enough to detect cadmium at doses below the median combined adverse effect concentration and the median lethal concentration. The stable nature of this trangenic line should allow for extremely rapid and reproducible toxicologic profiling of embryos and larvae throughout development.

However, the use <b>of</b> improved <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> as a means of reducing hunger and improving livelihoods has proved to be difficult to sustain, especially as a public good, when external (development) funding sources devoted to this area are minimal 1. In addition, the more complicated problem of delivery of an aquaculture system, not just improved fish strains and the technology, can present difficulties and may go explicitly unrecognized (from Sissel Rogne, as cited by Silje Rem 2002). Thus, the involvement of private partners has featured prominently in the strategy for transferring to the public technology related to improved Tilapia strains. Partnering with the private sector in delivery schemes to the poor should take into account both the public goods aspect and the requirement that the traits selected for breeding “improved” strains meet the actual needs of the resource poor farmer.

This technique may be used with very high degrees of confidence to assign to or exclude animals or products from their claimed origin, paternity or strain, and may be used as evidence in court proceedings. The second section of this paper describes the traceability of live molluscs for restocking and for human consumption. In these applications, genetic markers have been demonstrated to be suitable. Mechanical tagging on a small scale for research purposes has also been used. Otherwise, the only means of tracing live molluscs are the movement documents and the labelling on boxes that certifies the origin of the commodity. The third section describes the methods available for tracing live and dead crustaceans. A large variety of physical tagging methods for decapod crustaceans is described, such as the injection of biological stains (fast green, Niagara sky blue, trypan red and blue) and external tags such as coloured streamer tags, wire tags and a variety of anchor tags. Furthermore, a number of different internal coding methods, such as the coded micro-wire tags and injected elastomer tags are discussed in detail. As is the case for fish, genetic molecular techniques are also applied in population studies of crustaceans; some of the molecular genetic methods are described. Prawns for human consumption are most frequently packed whole or as tails after the necessary sorting, washing and freezing and the only way of performing a traceback is through documents relating to movement, invoices, health certificates and labelling of the boxes. The minimum requirements for labelling would be the content of the packages, i. e. species, quantity, identification of the manufacturer (name and address), packing place, importer/exporter or vendor of the product, in addition to the loading bill number.

40|$|The aim of {{environmental}} enrichment is {{to alter the}} environment of a captive animal {{in a way that}} results in improved mental and physical welfare. The technique has been utilised effectively for many years for captive mammals in a variety of settings. However, until now it has never been considered as a way of improving the welfare of aquatic animals such as fish. Fish that are used in regulatory toxicology studies are at present maintained solely in barren tank environments. Little is known about how these types of environments affect the well-being of the animals residing there and whether they impact either physiological heath or behavioural repertoire. This thesis aims to address this gap in the knowledge regarding the potential for environmental enrichment to improve the welfare of fish used in regulatory toxicology. More specifically it looks at two types of enrichment and the effects of these on the commonly used model species, the zebrafish (Danio rerio). The first type of enrichment studied was glass rod structures of varying heights provided to increase tank complexity and provide refuge. The glass structures did not produce any quantifiable benefits in unstressed fish and appeared to delay the formation of stable social hierarchies. When fish were stressed by a period of chasing, the presence of the glass rods appeared to reduce the magnitude of the cortisol response. Whilst this could be viewed as a potential benefit, it was felt that it would not outweigh the costs of this type of enrichment. The second type of enrichment studied was provision of airstones. Again, no clear evidence was found that fish in tanks with airstones experienced an improvement in welfare. The main observation was the vast increase in mortality in tanks containing these airstones, in particular, those of a smaller size. Regardless of the physiological cause underlying this result, this can only be viewed as a negative consequence and one that appears to rule out airstones as an effective form of enrichment for this species and <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish.</b> It was also observed that both stress and the presence of enrichment influenced the absolute deviation from the mean in several endpoints. Since changes in endpoint variation will have effects both on the number of animals required to statistically measure environmentally relevant effects this is a factor that should be considered when researching methods {{of environmental}} enrichment. Finally, results from these studies suggest the possibility that laboratory zebrafish do not require the addition of environmental enrichment to tanks in order to promote maximum welfare. Furthermore, as considerable costs would be involved in implementing many types of enrichment (relating to manufacture, cleaning, incompatibility of results with previous studies etc.) it is likely that observed benefits would have to be both substantial and well established in order for changes in regulatory guidelines to take place. For a species such as zebrafish that are extremely easy to breed and maintain in the laboratory with minimal amounts of disease, social problems or mortalities, it may be that current conditions are satisfactory.

Conjugations of R plasmids between a resistant bovine pathogenic E. coli strain and a susceptible E. coli <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> human origin were performed on a hand towel contaminated with milk from a cow with mastitis. A similar conjugation event between a resistant porcine pathogenic E. coli <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> human origin was studied in minced meat on a cutting board. Conjugation of R plasmids between a resistant <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fish</b> pathogenic bacterium A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida and a susceptible E. coli <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> human origin was performed in raw salmon on a cutting board. R plasmids in a <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida and a human pathogenic E. coli strain were conjugated to a susceptible porcine E. coli strain in porcine feces. Transfer of the different R plasmids was confirmed by plasmid profile analyses and determination of the resistance pattern of the transconjugants. The different R plasmids were transferred equally well under simulated natural conditions and under controlled laboratory conditions, with median conjugation frequencies ranging from 3 x 10 (- 6) to 8 x 10 (- 3). The present study demonstrates that conjugation and transfer of R plasmids is a phenomenon that belongs {{to the environment and}} can occur between bacterial <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> human, animal, and fish origins that are unrelated either evolutionarily or ecologically {{even in the absence of}} antibiotics. Consequently, the contamination of the environment with bacterial pathogens resistant to antimicrobial agents is a real threat not only as a source of disease but also as a source from which R plasmids can easily spread to other pathogens of diverse origins...|$|R
40|$|Post-stress plasma {{cortisol}} levels, {{following a}} standardized confinement stress, were monitored {{on a monthly}} basis for 5 months in 240 individually marked rainbow trout from each <b>of</b> two <b>strains.</b> At the end of this period individuals showing a consistent high or low response to stress were segregated. Post-stress plasma cortisol levels in selected high- and low-responding fish were similar for each strain (high 148. 6 ± 3. 2, 144. 7 ± 2. 4 ng ml− 1; low 80. 3 ± 2. 3, 72. 9 ± 2. 7 ng ml− 1). The difference in magnitude of response between the two selected groups was maintained for at least 28 months, post-stress plasma cortisol values in strain 1 at this point being, high responders 404. 1 ± 28. 2 ng ml− 1, low responders 172. 8 ± 20. 0 ng ml− 1. Despite this stability of response within the selected <b>fish,</b> analysis <b>of</b> the complete data set (480 fish) failed to demonstrate unequivocally whether a stable response level to stress is characteristic of all individuals. The implications of these results are discussed with reference to the potential benefits <b>of</b> producing <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> with a reduced sensitivity or responsiveness to common forms of aquacultural stress...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates whether {{two lines}} of rainbow trout {{displaying}} genetically determined variation in stress responsiveness and behavior also show differences in brain monoaminergic activity. In several brain regions, <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> rainbow trout selected for consistently high or low post-stress cortisol levels displayed differences in tissue concentrations of monoamines and/or monoamine metabolites, or in metabolite/monoamine ratios. High-responsive trout reacted to stress {{by an increase in}} the concentrations of both serotonin (brain stem), dopamine (brain stem), and norepinephrine (optic tectum, telencephalon), whereas low-responsive fish did not. Brain stem and optic tectum concentrations of monoamine metabolites were also elevated after stress in high responders, but not in low-responsive fish. The simultaneous increase in the concentration of monoamines and their metabolites suggests that both synthesis and metabolism of these transmitters were elevated after stress in high-responsive trout. A divergent pattern was seen in the hypothalamus, where low-responsive fish displayed elevated levels of 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid (a serotonin metabolite) and 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxyphenylglycol (a norepinephrine metabolite). In the telencephalon, both populations had elevated concentrations of these metabolites after stress. These results clearly suggest that selection for stress responsiveness in rainbow trout is also associated with changes in the function of brain monoaminergic systems. The possible functional significance of these observations is discussed with respect to the physiological and behavioral profile <b>of</b> these <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish.</b> Literature is reviewed showing that several factors affecting brain monoaminergic activity might be altered by selection for stress responsiveness, or alternatively be under direct influence of circulating glucocorticoids. ...|$|R

The differential ability <b>of</b> <b>strains</b> to produce a surface protein array crucial to their virulence, the A layer, and to produce smooth lipopolysaccharide is found to be important in the partitioning behavior of Aeromonas salmonicida. The presence of the A layer is shown to decrease the surface hydrophilicity of the pathogen, and to increase specifically its surface affinity for fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol. The method has application to the analysis of surface properties crucial to bacterial virulence, and to the selection <b>of</b> <b>strains</b> and mutants with specific surface characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel {{electrophoresis}} {{was used to}} analyze the lipopolysaccharides of typical and atypical <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fish</b> pathogen Aeromonas salmonicida. 32 P intrinsically radiolabeled lipopolysaccharide in sarcosinate-extracted outer membrane preparations, lipopolysaccharide stained by silver in proteinase K-digested outer membrane preparations and whole cell lysates, as well as purified lipopolysaccharide, displayed O-polysaccharide chains which were unusually homogeneous with respect to chain length. Chemical analysis further revealed that the sugar composition of the smooth lipopolysaccharide purified from three typical strains was very similar. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescent staining with both polyclonal and monoclonal antibody showed that the O-polysaccharide chains were strongly immunogenic and were antigenically cross-reactive on typical and atypical strains from diverse origins. Immunofluorescence analysis and phage binding studies demonstrated that a number of these O-polysaccharide chains traversed the surface protein array <b>of</b> virulent <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> A. salmonicida and were exposed on the cell surface...|$|R

In addition, {{the spread of}} drug resistance factors by conjugation was investigated. Regardless of the source <b>of</b> isolation, the <b>strains</b> exhibited variable reactions mainly for arginine dihydrolase, ornithine decarboxylase, and fermentation of sucrose, melibiose, amygdalin, and salicin. Total fatty acid methyl ester analysis by gas chromatography proved to be useful for an intratypic differentiation within the C. freundii strains studied. In fact, although all of the isolates exhibited similar fatty acid methyl ester profiles, {{significant differences in the}} major fatty acids 16 : 1 and 16 : 0 and in the 17 : 0 delta region were observed between the isolates from salmonids and the remaining strains. Serological studies using agglutination tests, analysis of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and the corresponding immunoblots with 13 antisera indicated a great antigenic diversity among the strains. Common LPS patterns were shared only by some isolates showing high cross-agglutination titers. In contrast, although all strains exhibited very similar surface protein patterns, only two common outer membrane proteins of 54 and 58 kDa were immunologically related. Infectivity trials performed in mice and rainbow trout indicated that all of the C. freundii strains were not pathogenic for mice (50 % lethal dose of > 5 x 10 (7)). Although the isolates displayed a low degree of virulence for trout, inoculated strains were always recovered from the survivors in pure culture. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{limitations}} for aquaculture development in developing countries is the limited availability of trained personnel {{in the areas of}} genetics and statistics. Technical staff involved in aquaculture often have little or no training in quantitative genetics and applied statistics to conduct well designed breeding programs for aquatic animal species. As a result there have been very few genetically improved <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> or crustaceans developed and used for aquaculture. In response to the prevailing situation the WorldFish Center has placed a strong emphasis on the enhancement of research capacity and training of national scientists in the area <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> breeding and genetics. Annually we run at least one course in quantitative genetics and its application to genetic resource management. Almost all participants come from National Aquaculture Research Institutions in different countries. Overall, the main aim of our courses is providing students with basic principles in quantitative genetics applied to performance improvement for aquatic animal species. Advanced courses are sometimes organised upon request from partner countries or due to a need for the implementation of projects activities. Areas of genetics covered in our courses include basic Mendelian and population genetics, quantitative genetics, and application of molecular information and reproductive technologies to practical breeding programs. In particular, we focus on aspects of quantitative genetics applied to fish improvement. Topics normally covered in-depth include strain collection and evaluation, establishment of the foundation population, design and implementation of the selection program, effective population size and control of inbreeding, selection index, genetic evaluation systems, estimation of genetic parameters, breeding structure, strategies for the effective dissemination <b>of</b> the improved <b>strain,</b> and use <b>of</b> DNA information in selective breeding programs. Currently, we are broadening the scope of our training program by including other topics such as genetic conservation, risk assessment in relation to the use <b>of</b> improved <b>strains,</b> and resource management and biodiversity. The application of genomic selection will be also included in due course...|$|R

It has also been confirmed {{that there are other}} <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> undefined Vibrio spp., readily isolated from estuarine environments, which are capable of lactose fermentation. Relatively extensive phenotypic analysis may be necessary to differentiate these strains from V. vulnificus. <b>Strains</b> <b>of</b> a Vibrio sp., pathogenic to eels commercially cultured in Japan, have been shown by DNA base composition and DNA homology to be members of the species V. vulnificus. Differences in phenotype and host specificity however, indicate that the eel isolates represent a different biogroup of V. vulnificus. It is proposed that strains similar in phenotype to the type <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> the species be classified as V. vulnificus biogroup 1, and that the eel isolates be classified as V. vulnificus biogroup 2. A group of organisms, phenotypically similar to the human pathogen Vibrio fluvialis, have been isolated from oysters suspected as the source of several cases of gastroenteritis in Louisiana, and from water, sediment, and shellfish in the Pacific Northwest. DNA base composition and DNA homology analyses have shown these organisms to actually be <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fish</b> pathogen V. anguillarum. These V. anguillarum are atypical in some of their phenotypic properties and in their sources of isolation.
