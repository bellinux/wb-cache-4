5|$|Drier {{parts of}} the country are highly prone to dust storms. These include areas west of Buenos Aires, which can average more than eight dust storms per year, and parts of Patagonia, owing to its aridity and windy climate. Certain areas in the Altiplano are also highly prone to dust storms owing to {{extensive}} areas of closed depressions and the presence of salt flats that erode the rock, which becomes a source of fine material that can travel large distances during periods of strong wind. Dust storms are more frequent during droughts, particularly in agricultural areas. Dust storms can effect large areas, leading to numerous impacts. These dust storms can lead to loss of crop and livestock, affecting the local economy. Productive topsoil may be lost during dust storms, leading to loss in <b>soil</b> <b>productivity,</b> which can increase soil erosion and negatively affect crop productivity in the long term. In addition to the impact on agriculture, dust storms can damage cars and buildings, lower visibility on roads, affect air quality, and affect water quality in rivers and lakes.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- An {{overview}} of the various agroforestry systems and practices that exist around the tropics and subtropics indicates that there are various ways in which farmers deliberately incorporate trees and shrubs ou farm production fields. Many of the species so incorporated are legumes. The role of woody perennials in agroforestry systems can be productive and/or protective. The former includes the production of food, fodder, fuelwood, mulch, green manure, wood and various other useful products. The most important protective funetions entail lhe use of woody perennials for soil protection and conservation, and for enhance-ment of <b>soil's</b> <b>productivity</b> ou a sustainable basis, especially ou account of the nitrogen [...] fixing capacity of lhe vast majority of them. Legumes {{are not the only}} group of woody species that have potential role ia agroforestry, but they offer by far the maximum range of choice of woody species for agroforestry iii terms of their economie uses as well as ecological adaptabiity.
