5000|$|In November 1885 {{electrical}} engineer William Stanley, Jr., a sometimes Great Barrington resident working for George Westinghouse, began installing a demonstration transformer based alternating current lighting system. Stanley felt AC was {{an improvement over}} the direct current system being used by Thomas Edison, and Stanley {{was trying to get}} Westinghouse to adopt it. Stanley had developed a <b>series</b> <b>transformer</b> that he thought would make AC practical. He built his components at the [...] "Old Rubber Factory" [...] south of Cottage Street and installed a Westinghouse steam engine powering a 500 volt Siemens generator. Stringing the power lines from tree to tree down the street, in March 1886 Stanley powered the system up and was able to expand it {{to the point where it}} could light 23 businesses along Main Street with very little power loss over 4000 feet. The system's 500 AC volt current was stepped down to 100 volts using the new Stanley transformer to power incandescent lamps at each location. This was the world's first practical demonstration of a transformer/alternating current system and the basis of the AC systems that Westinghouse would begin installing later that year.|$|E

40|$|The UPFC {{can provide}} {{simultaneous}} {{control of all}} basic power system pa-rameters (transmission voltage, impedance and phase angle). The controller can fulll functions of reactive shunt compensation, series compensation and phase shifting meeting multiple control objectives. From a functional per-spective, the objectives are met by applying a boosting transformer injected voltage and a exciting transformer reactive current. The injected voltage is inserted by a <b>series</b> <b>transformer.</b> Besides transformers, the general structure of UPFC contains also a "back to back " AC to DC voltage source converters operated from a common DC link capacitor, Figure 1. First converter (CONV 1) is connected in shunt and the second one (CONV 2) in series with the line. The shunt converter is pri-marily used to provide active power demand of the series converter through a common DC link. Converter 1 can also generate or absorb reactive power, if it is desired, and thereby provide independent shunt reactive compensation for the line. Converter 2 provides the main function of the UPFC by inject-ing a voltage with controllable magnitude and phase angle in series with the line via an voltage source, Figure 2. The reactance xs describes a reactance seen from terminals of the <b>series</b> <b>transformer</b> and is equal to (in p. u. base on system voltage and base power) xS = xkr 2 max(SB=SS) (1) where xk denotes the <b>series</b> <b>transformer</b> reactanse, rmax the maximum per unit value of injected voltage magnitude, SB the system base power, and SS the nominal rating power of the series converter.
