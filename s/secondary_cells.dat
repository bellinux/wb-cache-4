40|$|Xylem {{vessels are}} cells that develop a {{specifically}} ornamented <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall {{to ensure their}} vascular function, conferring both structural strength and impermeability. Further plasticity is given to these vascular cells by a range of different patterns described by their <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> walls that—as {{for the growth of}} all plant organs—are developmentally regulated. Microtubules and their associated proteins, named MAPs, are essential to define the shape, the orientation, the position and the overall pattern of these <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> walls. Key actors in this process are the land-plant specific MAP 70 proteins which not only allow the <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall to be positioned at the cell cortex but also determine the overall pattern described by xylem vessel <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> walls...|$|R

25|$|A {{wet cell}} battery has a liquid electrolyte. Other names are flooded cell, since the liquid covers all {{internal}} parts, or vented cell, since gases produced during operation can {{escape to the}} air. Wet cells were a precursor to dry cells and are commonly used as a learning tool for electrochemistry. They can be built with common laboratory supplies, such as beakers, for demonstrations of how electrochemical cells work. A particular type of wet cell known as a concentration cell is important in understanding corrosion. Wet cells may be primary cells (non-rechargeable) or <b>secondary</b> <b>cells</b> (rechargeable). Originally, all practical primary batteries such as the Daniell cell were built as open-top glass jar wet cells. Other primary wet cells are the Leclanche cell, Grove cell, Bunsen cell, Chromic acid cell, Clark cell, and Weston cell. The Leclanche cell chemistry was adapted to the first dry cells. Wet cells are still used in automobile batteries and in industry for standby power for switchgear, telecommunication or large uninterruptible power supplies, but in many places batteries with gel cells have been used instead. These applications commonly use lead–acid or nickel–cadmium cells.|$|E

40|$|Lignocellulosic biomass {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} raw materials on earth that can be utilized to created carbon-neutral biofuels as a replacement for conventional fossil fuels. In order to create ideal energy crops, the regulation and deposition of cell wall polysaccharides must first be fully understood. Improved understanding of cell wall regulation will enable selection of traits that can optimize biofuel feedstocks. Herein, I utilize the grass model system Brachypodium distachyon in order to understand the transcriptional regulation of <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall deposition. Gene expression profiling was used to elucidate transcription factors that regulate <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall biosynthesis. Through this method, WALL REGULATOR INTERACTING bHLH (WRIB) was identified and its role as a <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall regulator was tested. Yeast-one- and yeast-two-hybrid assays showed that WRIB is capable of binding to promoters of <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall biosynthesis genes, as well as interacting with known <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall transcription factor proteins and also Phytochrome B. These results suggest that WRIB plays an important role in the <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall regulatory network and could perhaps be modulated by Phytochrome B. Discovery of this novel and interesting gene furthers the overall understanding of <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall development with the goal of improving our ability to engineer biofuel feedstocks...|$|R
40|$|Forward genetic screens {{have led}} to the {{isolation}} of several genes involved in <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall formation. A variety of evidence, however, suggests that the list of genes identified is not exhaustive. To address this problem, microarray data have been generated from tissue undergoing <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall formation and used to identify genes that exhibit a similar expression pattern to the <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall–specific cellulose synthase genes IRREGULAR XYLEM 1 (IRX 1) and IRX 3. Crossreferencing this analysis with publicly available microarray data resulted in the selection of 16 genes for reverse genetic analysis. Lines containing an insertion in seven of these genes exhibited a clear irx phenotype characteristic of a <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall defect. Only one line, containing an insertion in a member of the COBRA gene family, exhibited a large decrease in cellulose content. Five of the genes identified as being essential for <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall biosynthesis have not been previously characterized. These genes are likely to define entirely novel processes in <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall formation and illustrate the success of combining expression data with reverse genetics to address gene function...|$|R
40|$|Tracheary element {{differentiation}} requires strict {{coordination of}} <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall synthesis and {{programmed cell death}} (PCD) to produce a functional cell corpse. The execution of cell death involves an influx of Ca 2 + into the cell and is manifested by rapid collapse of the large hydrolytic vacuole and cessation of cytoplasmic streaming. This precise means of effecting cell death {{is a prerequisite for}} postmortem developmental events, including autolysis and chromatin degradation. A 40 -kD serine protease is secreted during <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall synthesis, which may be the coordinating factor between <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall synthesis and PCD. Specific proteolysis of the extracellular matrix is necessary and sufficient to trigger Ca 2 + influx, vacuole collapse, cell death, and chromatin degradation, suggesting that extracellular proteolysis plays a key regulatory role during PCD. We propose a model in which <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall synthesis and cell death are coordinated by the concomitant secretion of the 40 -kD protease and <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall precursors. Subsequent cell death is triggered by a critical activity of protease or the arrival of substrate signal precursor corresponding with the completion of a functional <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall...|$|R

40|$|The <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> {{walls of}} tracheary {{elements}} and fibers {{are rich in}} cellulose microfibrils that are helically oriented and laterally aggregated. Support cells within the leaf midribs of mosses deposit cellulose-rich <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> walls, but their biosynthesis and microfibril organization have not been examined. Although the Cellulose Synthase (CESA) gene families of mosses and seed plants diversified independently, CESA knockout analysis in the moss Physcomitrella patens revealed parallels in CESA functional specialization of Arabidopsis and P. patens, with roles for both sub-functionalization and neo-functionalization. The similarities include use of different CESAs for primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall synthesis, a requirement for two or more functionally distinct CESA isoforms for <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall synthesis, interchangeability of some primary and secondary CESAs, and some CESA redundancy. The cellulose-deficient midribs of ppcesa 3 / 8 knockouts provided negative controls for structural characterization of stereid <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> walls in wild type P. patens. Sum frequency generation spectra collected from midribs were consistent with cellulose microfibril aggregation, and polarization microscopy revealed helical microfibril orientation only in wild type leaves. Thus, stereid secondary walls are structurally distinct from primary cell walls, and they share structural characteristics with the secondary walls of tracheary elements and fibers. A link between uncoupling of secondary CESAs from the regulatory constraints associated with primary cell wall deposition through sub-functionalization {{and the capacity to}} synthesize cellulose-rich <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> walls with aggregated and helically oriented microfibrils is discussed with respect to convergent evolution of structurally similar <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> walls...|$|R
40|$|Cellulose {{biosynthesis}} {{in plant}} <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> walls {{forms the basis}} of vascular development in land plants, with xylem tissues constituting {{the vast majority of}} terrestrial biomass. We used plant lines that contained an inducible master transcription factor controlling xylem cell fate to quantitatively image fluorescently tagged cellulose synthase enzymes during cellulose deposition in living protoxylem cells. The formation of <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall thickenings was associated with a redistribution and enrichment of CESA 7 -containing cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs) into narrow membrane domains. The velocities of <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall–specific CSCs were faster than those of primary cell wall CSCs during abundant cellulose production. Dynamic intracellular of endomembranes, in combination with increased velocity and high density of CSCs, enables cellulose to be synthesized rapidly in <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> walls...|$|R

40|$|Using co-expression network analysis, we {{identified}} 123 transcription factors (TFs) as candidate <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall regulators in rice. To validate whether these TFs are asso-ciated with <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall formation, six TF genes be-longing to the MYB, NAC or homeodomain-containing TF families were overexpressed or downregulated in rice. With {{the exception of}} OsMYB 58 / 63 -RNAi plants, all transgenic plants showed phenotypes possibly related to <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall alteration, such as dwarfism, narrow and dark green leaves, and also altered rice cinnamyl alcohol dehydro-genase 2 (OsCAD 2) gene expression and lignin content. These results suggest {{that many of the}} 123 candidate <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall-regulating TFs are likely to function in <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall formation in rice. Further analyses were performed for the OsMYB 55 / 61 and OsBLH 6 TFs, the former being a TF in which the Arabidopsis ortholog is known to participate in lignin biosynthesis (AtMYB 61) and the latter being one for which no previous involvement in cell wall formation has been reported even in Arabidopsis (BLH 6). OsMYB 55 / 61 and OsBLH 6 –GFP fusion proteins localized to the nucleus of onion epidermal cells. Moreover, expression of a reporter gene driven by the OsCAD 2 promoter was enhanced in rice calli when OsMYB 55 / 61 or OsBLH 6 was transiently ex-pressed, demonstrating that they function in <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall formation. These results show the validity of identifying potential <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall TFs in rice by the use of rice co-expression network analysis...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} {{reported that the}} cwa 1 mutation disturbed the deposition and assembly of <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall materials in the cortical fiber of rice internodes. Genetic analysis revealed that cwa 1 is allelic to bc 1, which encodes glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored COBRA-like protein with the highest homology to Arabidopsis COBRA-like 4 (COBL 4) and maize Brittle Stalk 2 (Bk 2). Our results suggested that CWA 1 /BC 1 {{plays a role in}} assembling <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall materials at appropriate sites, enabling synthesis of highly ordered <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall structure with solid and flexible internodes in rice. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of CWA 1 /BC 1, as well as its orthologs (COBL 4, Bk 2) and other BC 1 -like proteins in rice, shows weak similarity to a family II carbohydrate-binding module (CBM 2) of several bacterial cellulases. To investigate the importance of the CBM-like sequence of CWA 1 /BC 1 in the assembly of <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall materials, Trp residues in the CBM-like sequence, which is important for carbohydrate binding, were substituted for Val residues and introduced into the cwa 1 mutant. CWA 1 /BC 1 with the mutated sequence did not complement the abnormal <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> walls seen in the cwa 1 mutant, indicating that the CBM-like sequence is essential for the proper function of CWA 1 /BC 1, including assembly of <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall materials...|$|R
