40|$|Natural gas {{can readily}} {{be stored in}} {{depleted}} gas reservoirs, but when under storage in the <b>storage</b> <b>horizon,</b> this gas may experience some anomalies that may affect its inventory and performance. Evaluation and performance of the natural gas stored was determined by inventory analysis and by primary depletion performance. This made use pressure-content plots of P/Z versus inventory to determine gas migration into or away from the storage reservoir and its magnitude. The optimal performance of the stored gas {{was carried out by}} comparing the various stored volumes, the amount of non effective gas present and how much of it could be recovered. This was done for the storage reservoir when it was not subject to gas gain or loss, when it was subject to gas loss and when it was subject to gas gain. It was shown that gas storage in depleted gas storage reservoir subjected to gas gain is the best form of underground natural gas storage...|$|E
40|$|The Yucca Mountain Project has an {{opportunity}} to evaluate possible mobilization and transport of radioactive materials away from the <b>storage</b> <b>horizon</b> in the proposed repository. One scenario by which such transport could occur involves water leaving the storage area and carrying radioactive particulates of colloidal size. The colloids could move along the gas-liquid interface in partially filled fractures within the vadose zone. It should be possible to check the reality of this proposed scenario by examining ``anthropogenic analogs`` of the repository. These are sites of nuclear tests conducted in unsaturated tuff at the Nevada Test Site (NTS). We propose to drill under one or more such sites to determine if radionuclides have moved from their original confinement in the puddle- glass {{at the bottom of the}} cavity. This document examines the characteristics of an ideal test site for such a study, suggests several possible locations that have some of the desired characteristics, and recommends one of these sites for the proposed drilling...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs {{part of the}} Ketzin pilot test site, {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) has been {{injected}} into a saline formation around 650 m deep since June 2008. Analysis of measured well temperature and pressure data at two observation wells after the arrival of CO 2 has shown that two-phase fluid conditions are prevailing in the upper 400 m of the wells. This significantly hampers the ability to accurately describe the density – and temperature – profile of a well, which is essential to predict the relationship between well-head and reservoir pressure. The pressure and temperature profile depends crucially on {{the depth of the}} liquid CO 2 free surface, which can be obtained by wrapping a radial temperature simulator in an optimization algorithm that imposes closure of the heat transport at the well scale. Vertical heat transport, necessary for balancing the heat in- and outflow, relies on the upward movement of CO 2 vapor bubbles in the liquid-dominated zone and by a descending liquid CO 2 film in the upper vapor-dominated zone. A vertical bubble velocity of around 45 mm/s was derived from heat balance and confirmed by camera inspection movie. Temperature and pressure profiles also showed that Ktzi 200 acted as a distillation column: the injected CO 2 (with purity > 99. 9 %), picked up water during the residence in the <b>storage</b> <b>horizon.</b> The extremely accurate equation of state for CO 2 can accurately predict fluid properties in the two-phase zone and reveals that both light and heavy components in the gas entering the well are not present in the two-phase zone. This, together with an analysis of the thermodynamic behavior of the gas mixture suggests that a distillation process purified CO 2, at least in {{the upper part of the}} well...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGeoelectrical {{methods are}} {{particularly}} suited for CO 2 injection monitoring {{due to their}} high sensitivity to fluid displacement processes in porous rock formations. The use of borehole electrodes is favorable for deep <b>storage</b> <b>horizons.</b> Yet data acquisition based on permanently installed borehole electrodes can be challenged by the finite extent of the electrodes, unintended borehole deviation and complex borehole completion. Such conditions can lead to systematic errors in the electrical data sets, distortions of tomograms, and ultimately misinterpretations. We systematically analyze the effects of different borehole related error sources on tomographic inversion results and present respective methods for mitigation. Specifically, we incorporate the finite extent of the ring electrodes and the borehole completion into the electrical finite-element models and discuss the opportunity to infer borehole deviations solely based on geoelectrical data {{by means of a}} coupled inversion. While the finite extent of ring electrodes can be neglected if the electrode spacing is sufficiently large (> 5 m), different borehole completion materials used to fill the well annulus can cause potentially strong resistivity contrasts between the borehole completion and the rock formation, i. e., close to the electrodes. Resulting inversion artifacts are generally less severe when the borehole completion is more resistive compared to the surrounding rock. It is also shown that 2. 5 D inversion approaches are not adequate for imaging injection experiments in the presence of borehole completion. Unintended borehole deviation can result in geometric errors. Especially, vertical electrode shifts cause strong and localized inversion artifacts. Coupled inverse schemes potentially provide the opportunity to infer electrode shifts solely based on geoelectrical data provided the availability of high quality measurements (< 5 % data error). After discussing the effects of the different borehole related error sources, the mitigation methods are validated using synthetic data sets. Subsequently, relevant methods are applied to a field data set from the Ketzin CO 2 storage site, Germany, where crosshole electrical resistivity imaging is used for CO 2 migration monitoring. The mitigation methods presented can improve estimates of the subsurface resistivity distribution, which, in our particular example, is an essential basis for the quantification of CO 2 saturation from time-lapse geoelectrical measurements...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the valuation of gas <b>storage</b> on finite <b>horizon.</b> Focusing on the timing optionality of storage we construct a stochastic control model that reduces to solving an optimal switching problem with inventory. Extending the methodology from Carmona and Ludkovski (2005), we then construct a robust numerical {{scheme based on}} Monte Carlo regressions. The idea is to simultaneously approximate the optimal switching times along all the simulated paths. The main difficulty {{is dealing with the}} path-dependent inventory. The scheme is compared to the traditional quasi-variational framework and illustrated with a variety of concrete examples. We also consider related problems of interest, such as supply guarantees and natural resource management...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} pillars of modern {{cosmology}} theory {{is a period of}} accelerating expansion in the early universe. This accelerating expansion, or inflation, must be sustained for at least 30 e [...] foldings. One mechanism used to drive the acceleration is the addition of a new energy field, called the Inflaton; often this is a scalar field. We propose an alternative mechanism which, like our approach to explain the late-time accelerating universe, uses the entropy and temperature intrinsic to information holographically stored on a surface enclosing the observed space. The acceleration is due in both cases to an emergent entropic force, naturally arising from the information <b>storage</b> on the <b>horizon.</b> Comment: 12 pages; version to appear in IJMP...|$|R

40|$|To {{accommodate}} the observed accelerated {{expansion of the}} universe, one popular idea is to invoke a driving term in the Friedmann-Lemaitre equation of dark energy which must then comprise 70 % of the present cosmological energy density. We propose an alternative interpretation which {{takes into account the}} entropy and temperature intrinsic to the horizon of the universe due to the information holographically stored there. Dark energy is thereby obviated and the acceleration is due to an entropic force naturally arising from the information <b>storage</b> on the <b>horizon</b> surface screen. We consider an additional quantitative approach inspired by surface terms in general relativity and show that this leads to the entropic accelerating universe.

40|$|Precipitation and {{catchment}} {{characteristics of}} mountainous headwaters can vary largely within short distances. It remains unclear how {{these two factors}} determine the contribution of event water and pre-event water to stormflow. We investigated this in five neighboring headwaters with high annual precipitation amounts (> 2, 000 mm y⁻¹) in a steep pre-alpine region in Switzerland. Rainfall and streamwater of 13 different rainstorms were sampled (P: 5 mm intervals, Q: 12 to 51 samples per events) to perform a two-component isotope hydrograph separation. Pre-event water contributions based on δ¹⁸O or δ²H computation were similar. The pre-event water contributions of headwaters depended largely on rainfall (amount and intensity) and varied more between events than between catchments, despite clear differences in land cover between the catchments. Furthermore, antecedent wetness was not found to control pre-event water contribution. With increasing rainfall amount, the proportion of rainfall in runoff increased and changed from pre-event to event water dominated. The variable rainfall amount and small active <b>storage</b> (organic soil <b>horizon,</b> 20 – 50 cm) resulted in a threshold in the upper soil horizon with subsequently more variable pre-event water contribution. Our results show the necessity of sampling in different headwaters and events to better understand controlling factors in runoff generation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{expands the}} {{discussion}} about future balancing reserve provision to the long-term perspective of 2050. Most pathways for a transformation towards a decarbonized electricity sector rely on very high shares of fluctuating renewables. This {{can be a challenge}} for the provision of balancing reserves, although their influence on the balancing cost is unclear. Apart from the transformation of the generation portfolio, various technical and regulatory developments within the balancing framework might further influence balancing costs: i) dynamic dimensioning of balancing reserves, ii) provision by fluctuating renewables or new (battery) storage technologies, and iii) exchange of balancing reserves between balancing zones. The first part of this paper discusses and transforms these developments into quantitative scenario definitions. The second part applies these scenarios to dynELMOD (dynamic Electricity Model), an investment model of the European electricity system that is extended to include balancing reserve provision. In contrast to other models applied in most papers on balancing reserves, this model is capable of evaluating the interdependencies between developments in balancing reserve provision and high shares of fluctuating renewables jointly. The results show that balancing reserve cost can be kept at current levels for a renewable electricity system until 2050, when using a dynamic reserve sizing horizon. Apart from the sizing <b>horizon,</b> <b>storage</b> capacity withholding duration and additional balancing demand from RES are the main driver of balancing costs. Renewables participation in balancing provision is mainly important for negative reserves, while storages play an important role for the provision of positive reserves. However, only on very few occasions, additional storage investments are required for balancing reserve provision, as most of the time sufficient storage capacities are available in the electricity system...|$|R
40|$|TILOS is an Innovation Action EU-funded project {{under the}} Local/Small Scale <b>Storage</b> Call of <b>Horizon</b> 2020, {{engaging}} {{a total of}} 15 partners. The project aims to demonstrate the optimal integration of local scale energy storage in a fully-operated, smart island microgrid that will also communicate with a main electricity grid. The main objective of the project will be the development and operation of a prototype battery storage system, based on NaNiCl 2 batteries, provided with an optimum, real-environment smart grid control system and coping {{with the challenge of}} supporting multiple tasks, ranging from microgrid energy management, maximization of RES penetration and grid stability, to export of guaranteed energy amounts and provision of ancillary services to the main grid. The battery system will support both stand-alone and grid-connected operation, while proving its interoperability with the rest of microgrid components, including demand side management aspects and distributed, residential heat storage in the form of domestic hot water. TILOS project addresses the high-priority area of island regions. In doing so, apart from Tilos island, TILOS also engages Pellworm, La Graciosa and Corsica, aiming to create an island platform that will enable transfer of technological experience. Finally, by also addressing social issues, through public engagement, and by developing novel business models and policy instruments, TILOS puts emphasis on the market diffusion of both battery storage systems and the integrated energy solution implemented on the island of Tilos. Having already covered the fist year of project implementation, the aim {{of this paper is to}} give an overall presentation of the TILOS project and at the same time illustrate the main accomplishments and issues arising during this early stage. Furthermore, the current work aims to also reflect upon the realization of an actual, demonstration project and elaborate on the application prospects deriving from the project successful implementation...|$|R
40|$|The podzol-ferralsol soil systems, which cover great {{areas of}} Amazonia and other {{equatorial}} regions, are frequently associated with kaolin deposits and store and export {{large amounts of}} carbon. Although natural organic matter (NOM) {{plays a key role}} in their dynamics, little is known about their biogeochemistry. In order to assess the specific role of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on NOM <b>storage</b> in deep <b>horizons</b> and to determine possible relationships between kaolin formation and DOM properties, we studied the groundwater composition of a typical podzol-ferralsol soil catena from the Alto Rio Negro region, Brazil. Groundwater was sampled using tension-free lysimeters placed according to soil morphology. DOC, EH, pH, and dissolved Si, Al 3 +, Fe 2 +, and Fe 3 + were analyzed for all samples and values are given in a database. Quantification of other dissolved ions, small carboxylic acids and SUVA 254 index and acid-base microtitration was achieved on selected samples. Part of the DOM produced by the hydromorphic podzols is directly exported to the blackwater streams; another part percolates at greater depth, and more than 90 % of it adsorbs in the Bh-Bhs <b>horizons,</b> allowing carbon <b>storage</b> at depth. Humic substances are preferentially adsorbed with regard to small carboxylic compounds. With regard to kaolin genesis, kaolinite precipitation is favored by Al release from NOM mineralization within the Bh-Bhs and kaolin bleaching is ensured by iron reduction due to acidity and relatively low EH. Fe 2 + mobility can be related to small EH variations and enhanced by the significant concentration of small carboxylic acids. The long-term result of these processes is the thickening of the kaolin, and it can be inferred that kaolin is likely to occur where active, giant podzols are close to a slope gradient sufficient enough to lower the deep water table...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} {{the fate of}} root and litter derived carbon into soil organic matter and dissolved organic matter in soil profiles, in order to explain unexpected positive effects of plant diversity on carbon storage. A time series of soil and soil solution samples was investigated at the field site of The Jena Experiment. In addition to the main biodiversity experiment with C 3 plants, a C 4 species (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) naturally labeled with 13 C was grown on an extra plot. Changes in organic carbon concentration in soil and soil solution were combined with stable isotope measurements to follow the fate of plant carbon into the soil and soil solution. A split plot design with plant litter removal versus double litter input simulated differences in biomass input. After 2 years, the no litter and double litter treatment, respectively, showed an increase of 381 g C m ? 2 and 263 g C m ? 2 to 20 cm depth, while 71 g C m ? 2 and 393 g C m ? 2 were lost between 20 and 30 cm depth. The isotopic label in the top 5 cm indicated that 11 and 15 % of soil organic carbon were derived from plant material on the no litter and the double litter treatment, respectively. Without litter, this equals {{the total amount of}} carbon newly stored in soil, whereas with double litter this corresponds to twice the amount of stored carbon. Our results indicate that litter input resulted in lower carbon storage and larger carbon losses and consequently accelerated turnover of soil organic carbon. Isotopic evidence showed that inherited soil organic carbon was replaced by fresh plant carbon near the soil surface. Our results suggest that primarily carbon released from soil organic matter, not newly introduced plant organic matter, was transported in the soil solution and contributed to the observed carbon <b>storage</b> in deeper <b>horizons...</b>|$|R
