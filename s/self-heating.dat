5|$|Plutonium {{isotopes}} undergo radioactive decay, {{which produces}} decay heat. Different isotopes produce different amounts of heat per mass. The decay heat is usually listed as watt/kilogram, or milliwatt/gram.

5|$|Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} metal. The berkelium-249 isotope emits low-energy {{electrons and}} thus is relatively safe to handle. It decays with a half-life of 330days to californium-249, which is a strong emitter of ionizing alpha particles. This gradual transformation is an important consideration when studying the properties of elemental berkelium and its chemical compounds, since the formation of californium brings not only chemical contamination, but also free-radical effects and <b>self-heating</b> from the emitted alpha particles.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium(III) oxide (Es2O3) was {{obtained}} by burning einsteinium(III) nitrate. It forms colorless cubic crystals, which were first characterized from microgram samples sized about 30 nanometers. Two other phases, monoclinic and hexagonal, are known for this oxide. The formation of a certain Es2O3 phase depends on the preparation technique and sample history, {{and there is no}} clear phase diagram. Interconversions between the three phases can occur spontaneously, as a result of self-irradiation or <b>self-heating.</b> The hexagonal phase is isotypic with lanthanum(III) oxide where the Es3+ ion is surrounded by a 6-coordinated group of O2− ions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract − <b>Self-heat</b> of {{platinum}} resistance thermometers (PRTs) is {{a well-known}} phenomenon that occurs when measurement current additionally heats up a PRT sensor. This temperature increase depends on measurement current, PRT design, operating temperature and surrounding medium. <b>Self-heat</b> temperature increase can be corrected with some residual uncertainty, but this applies mainly to calibration of PRTs, while in practical temperature measurements <b>self-heat</b> measurement or estimation is difficult due to poor temperature stability and/or short measurement time that does not allow temperature transient effects to fade away. If not handled properly, <b>self-heat</b> uncertainty {{can be one of}} the largest, but often neglected uncertainty contributions in temperature measurement.

An {{investigation}} path {{starting from}} (Mn,Ni,Co,Fe) 3 O 4 nanometric powder preparation, NTC thick-film characterization, realization and optimization of new planar thermistor geometries to custom design thermistors and their application for temperature and volume airflow sensors was recently determined.

5|$|Polonium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Po and atomic number 84. A rare and highly radioactive metal with no stable isotopes, polonium is chemically similar to selenium and tellurium, though its metallic character {{resembles that of}} its horizontal neighbors in the periodic table: thallium, lead, and bismuth. Due to the short half-life of all its isotopes, its natural occurrence is limited to tiny traces of the fleeting polonium-210 (with a half-life of 138days) in uranium ores, {{as it is the}} penultimate daughter of natural uranium-238. Though slightly longer-lived isotopes exist, they are much more difficult to produce. Today, polonium is usually produced in milligram quantities by the neutron irradiation of bismuth. Due to its intense radioactivity, which results in the radiolysis of chemical bonds and radioactive <b>self-heating,</b> its chemistry has mostly been investigated on the trace scale only.|$|E
5|$|Two {{forms of}} {{berkelium}}(III) bromide are known, a monoclinic with berkelium coordination 6 and orthorhombic with coordination 8; {{the latter is}} less stable and transforms to the former phase upon heating to about 350 °C. An important phenomenon for radioactive solids has been studied for these two crystal forms: the structures of fresh and aged 249BkBr3 samples were studied using X-ray diffraction over a period longer than 3 years, so that various fractions of 249Bk had beta decayed to 249Cf. No change in structure was observed upon the 249BkBr3—249CfBr3 transformation, even though the orthorhombic bromide was previously unknown for californium. However, other differences were noted for 249BkBr3 and 249CfBr3. For example, the latter could be reduced with hydrogen to249CfBr2, but the former could be not – this result was reproduced on individual 249BkBr3 and 249CfBr3 samples, as well on the samples containing both bromides. The intergrowth of californium in berkelium occurs {{at a rate of}} 0.22% per day and is an intrinsic obstacle in studying berkelium properties. Besides a chemical contamination, 249Cf, as an alpha emitter brings undesirable self-damage of the crystal lattice due to the resulting <b>self-heating.</b> This can be avoided by performing measurements as a function of time and extrapolating the obtained results.|$|E

To determine a suitable system for natural gas liquid (NGL) fractionation trains, rigorous analysis and comparative study of several HPAD and SHRT options for the retrofitting of a single column were studied in the present work. The retrofit options considered were vapor compression (VC), mechanical vapor recompression (MVR), thermal vapor recompression (TVR), bottom flashing (BF), side heat exchanger (SHE), intermediate heating and cooling (IHC), <b>self-heat</b> recuperative (SHR) and modified <b>self-heat</b> recuperative (MSHR) distillation.

The analysis shows that the MVR gives the highest energy cost reduction of 68. 11 % as compared to that of the base case (BC) conventional column.

25|$|A {{thermocouple}} produces small signals, often microvolts in magnitude. Precise {{measurements of}} this signal require an amplifier with low {{input offset voltage}} and with care taken to avoid thermal emfs from <b>self-heating</b> within the voltmeter itself. If the thermocouple wire has a high resistance for some reason (poor contact at junctions, or very thin wires used for fast thermal response), the measuring instrument should have high input impedance to prevent an offset in the measured voltage. A useful feature in thermocouple instrumentation will simultaneously measure resistance and detect faulty connections in the wiring or at thermocouple junctions.|$|E
25|$|Resistance {{thermometers}} and thermistors {{are generally}} used in two ways. First, {{they can be}} used as thermometers: By measuring the resistance, the temperature of the environment can be inferred. Second, {{they can be used}} in conjunction with Joule heating (also called self-heating): If a large current is running through the resistor, the resistor's temperature rises and therefore its resistance changes. Therefore, these components {{can be used in a}} circuit-protection role similar to fuses, or for feedback in circuits, or for many other purposes. In general, <b>self-heating</b> can turn a resistor into a nonlinear and hysteretic circuit element. For more details see Thermistor#Self-heating effects.|$|E

25|$|Many {{compounds}} {{of thorium}} are known: {{this is because}} thorium and uranium are the most stable and accessible actinides and are the only actinides that can be studied safely and legally in bulk in a normal laboratory. As such, they have the best-known chemistry of the actinides, along with that of plutonium, as the <b>self-heating</b> and radiation from them {{is not enough to}} cause radiolysis of chemical bonds as it is for the other actinides. While the later actinides from americium onwards are predominantly trivalent and behave more similarly to the corresponding lanthanides, as one would expect from periodic trends, the early actinides up to plutonium (thus including thorium and uranium) have relativistically destabilised and hence delocalised 5f and 6d electrons that participate in chemistry in a similar way to the early transition metals of group 3 through 8: thus, all their valence electrons can participate in chemical reactions, although this is not common for neptunium and plutonium.|$|E
25|$|Wegner {{suggests}} {{that a combination of}} naval ship design, and a change in the type of coal used to fuel naval ships, might have facilitated the explosion postulated by the Rickover study. Up to the time of Maines building, he explains, common bulkheads separated coal bunkers from ammunition lockers and American naval ships burned primarily smokeless anthracite coal. With {{an increase in the number}} of steel ships, the U.S. Navy switched to bituminous coal, which burned at a hotter temperature than anthracite coal, and allowed ships to steam faster. However, Wegner explains, while anthracite coal is not subject to spontaneous combustion, bituminous coal is considerably more volatile. In fact, bituminous coal is known for releasing the largest amounts of firedamp, a dangerous and explosive mixture of gases (chiefly methane). Firedamp is explosive at concentrations between 4% and 16%, with most violence at around 10%. In addition, there was another potential contributing factor in the bituminous coal – this was iron sulfide, also known as pyrite, that was likely present. The presence of pyrites presents two additional risk factors. The first involves oxidation. Pyrite oxidation is sufficiently exothermic that underground coal mines in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally had serious problems with spontaneous combustion in the mined-out areas of the mine. This process can result from the disruption caused by mining from the seams, or other processing, which then exposes the sulfides in the ore to air and water. The presence of pyrites in coal has been recognized to be <b>self-heating.</b> The second risk factor involves an additional capability of pyrites to provide fire ignition under certain conditions. Pyrites, which derive their name from the Greek root word pyr, which means fire, can cause sparks when struck by steel or other sufficiently hard surfaces. Before the use of flintlock guns, for example, pyrites were used to strike sparks to ignite gunpowder in an earlier model type gun, known as a wheellock. In the presence of combustible gasses issuing from the bituminous coal, the pyrites could therefore have provided the ignition capability needed to create an explosion. A number of bunker fires of this type had, in fact, been reported aboard U.S. warships before Maines explosion, in several cases nearly sinking the ships. Wegner also cites a 1997 heat transfer study which concluded that a coal bunker fire, of the type suggested by Rickover, could have taken place and ignited the ship's ammunition.|$|E
