5|$|The Red <b>Spot</b> <b>was</b> {{reportedly}} {{lost from}} sight {{on several occasions}} between 1665 and 1708 before becoming quite conspicuous in 1878. It was recorded as fading again in 1883 and {{at the start of}} the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's win {{marked the}} first time a team had {{retained}} the trophy since Tottenham Hotspur in 1982. They later played against league champions Manchester United in the 2003 FA Community Shield. Given Arsenal had already qualified for Europe via their league position, their UEFA Cup <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> awarded to runners-up Southampton.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the Great Dark Spot, an anti-cyclonic storm system {{spanning}} 13,000×6,600km, {{was discovered}} by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft. The storm resembled the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. Some five years later, on 2 November 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope {{did not see the}} Great Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark <b>Spot</b> <b>was</b> found in Neptune's northern hemisphere.|$|E
5000|$|A typical <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> [...] "zonal", {{meaning it}} has a {{definite}} edge and often has a darker border. When lots of <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> present, they can grow together and become a blight or a blotch. Fungal <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> usually round or free-form in shape.|$|R

5|$|It was {{reported}} that Madonna's appearance on the show was to promote her album American Life (2003). Many believed that the guest spot on the show {{would be good for}} the singer, following her appearance in the film 2002 film Swept Away, which was a box office disappointment. Her manager, however, insisted that Madonna's guest <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> not an attempt to showcase her acting abilities.|$|E
5|$|Leftover {{heat from}} this hot <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> later liberated by Basin and Range-associated rifting {{and created the}} many {{overlapping}} lava flows {{that make up the}} Lava Beds of Idaho. The largest rift zone is the Great Rift; it is from this 'Great Rift fissure system' that Craters of the Moon, Kings Bowl, and Wapi lava fields were created. The Great Rift is a National Natural Landmark.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} was immediately suppressed by the authorities. A story invented on the <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> {{that it was}} an accident caused by drinking vodka and smoking, or spontaneously combusting, aiming to divert interest to gossip and portray Siwiec as an irresponsible drunk. He was also declared mentally ill.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 18 mm. The forewings are grey-whitish with a minute fuscous stigmata. The first discal <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> {{found at the}} middle and the plical <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> placed beyond it. The second discal <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> found at three-fourth {{and there are some}} minute obscure costal and terminal dots. The hindwings are whitish.|$|R

50|$|Café au lait <b>spots</b> can <b>be</b> removed with lasers. Results are {{variable}} as the <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> {{often not}} completely removed or {{can come back}} after treatment. Often, a test <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> treated first to help predict the likelihood of treatment success.|$|R
5|$|The <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> lensed by {{director}} of photography Daniel Bronks, and edited by Jo Guest at Final Cut, London. Post production was handled by London companies The Moving Picture Company (main body, producer Graham Bird) and Golden Square (end frame, producer Jessica Mankowitz). Sound {{was designed and}} arranged by Parv Thind at Wave Studios, London.|$|E
5|$|The victory meant Liverpool won the FA Cup for {{the seventh}} time. They later played against league champions Chelsea in the 2006 FA Community Shield. Given Liverpool had already {{qualified}} for Europe via their league position, their UEFA Cup <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> awarded to runners-up West Ham.|$|E
5|$|After plans by WWF {{writers to}} turn the Ultimate Warrior against Savage were {{scrapped}} due to the Warrior's refusal to turn heel, the two were scheduled to face Flair and Ramon at Survivor Series 1992. However, as the Warrior quit the promotion on November 21, his <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> surprisingly offered to Mr. Perfect, who accepted it in spite of Flair, thereby turning face and initiating a feud with Flair which culminated in Flair leaving the WWF in January 1993.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{the quota}} law {{mandates}} {{a certain percentage}} of candidate <b>spots</b> <b>be</b> reserved for women, it is not compulsory that those <b>spots</b> <b>be</b> filled by women.|$|R
30|$|To {{confirm the}} {{successful}} enzymatic formation of sugar esters the extracts were analyzed via TLC. In negative controls without lipase or fatty acid two slightly <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> visible. These <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> identical {{with the standards}} of pure glucose (Rf 0.1) and xylose (Rf 0.16) which demonstrated that these <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> sugars of the sugar mix in the used DES.|$|R

5|$|After {{serving as}} a judge on the program for four seasons, Dickinson's <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> filled with Twiggy Lawson in 2005 for the show's fifth season. In December of the same year, Oxygen Network hired Dickinson for its new reality {{modeling}} television program {{which at the time}} was initially titled The Janice Dickinson Project. It centered on her efforts to launch her own business with a modeling agency. Her television show launched in 2006, titled: The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Sheridan {{was hired}} as an {{assistant}} writer for the sitcom Shaky Ground. During his time on the show, he also worked elsewhere as a freelance writer. Following that show's cancellation in 1993, Sheridan {{was hired as}} an assistant on the show Living Single, where he wrote four episodes. Sheridan was promoted to writer, and worked on the show until it was cancelled in 1998. Shortly after, Sheridan {{received a call from}} his agent, where he was told that the only show with an open <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> Family Guy, which Sheridan did not want to do, thinking that writing for an animated show would end his career.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} the release of the iPhone 5S, on March 25, 2014, Apple {{announced}} that sales of the iPhone brand had exceeded 500 million units. By May 2014, despite having been on the market for eight months, the iPhone 5S reportedly outsold the newly released Samsung Galaxy S5 by 40%, with 7 million iPhone 5S units versus 5 million Galaxy S5 units. The Galaxy S5's failure to oust the iPhone 5S from the top selling <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> a major setback for Samsung Mobile, as the preceding Samsung Galaxy SIII and Samsung Galaxy S4, {{in the first quarter of}} their releases, had outsold the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 respectively.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time, 30-second {{television}} <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> shown on TV — short trailers providing {{a glimpse of}} the story to unfold in Freedom 1. The 5th advertising <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> currently being shown on Japanese television , and reveals major plot advances from Freedom 3. Some of these <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> made available on the limited-edition Freedom Previsited DVD (see release notes below).|$|R
5000|$|Menil: <b>Spots</b> <b>are</b> more {{distinct}} than {{common in}} summer and no black is seen around the rump patch or on the tail. In winter, <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> still clear on a darker brown coat.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{specimens}} {{have on the}} upperside of the hindwings a small, ochraceous,submarginal spot {{between the}} lower median nervules below, the series of submarginal <b>spots</b> <b>is</b> always complete, but the <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> often very feebly marked.|$|R
5|$|Six years later, the Voyager {{missions}} {{vastly improved}} {{the understanding of}} the Galilean moons and discovered Jupiter's rings. They also confirmed that the Great Red <b>Spot</b> <b>was</b> anticyclonic. Comparison of images showed that the Red Spot had changed hue since the Pioneer missions, turning from orange to dark brown. A torus of ionized atoms was discovered along Io's orbital path, and volcanoes were found on the moon's surface, some in the process of erupting. As the spacecraft passed behind the planet, it observed flashes of lightning in the night side atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The 1979 team {{not only}} posted their first winning record, but earned {{a playoff spot}} by winning the NFC Central {{division}} title. The playoff <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> secured in the final week in a rain-sodden game against the Kansas City Chiefs, with the only score being a 19-yard field goal by Neil O'Donoghue. They then recorded their first-ever playoff win by defeating the Philadelphia Eagles behind Bell's 142 yards rushing. Tampa Bay hosted the 1979 NFC Championship Game the following week, but lost 9–0 to the Los Angeles Rams.|$|E
5|$|The Snake River Plain is a {{volcanic}} province {{that was created}} {{by a series of}} cataclysmic caldera-forming eruptions which started about 15 million years ago. A migrating hotspot thought to now exist under Yellowstone Caldera in Yellowstone National Park has been implicated. This hot <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> under the Craters of the Moon area some 10 to 11million years ago but 'moved' as the North American Plate migrated southwestward. Pressure from the hot spot heaves the land surface up, creating fault-block mountains. After the hot spot passes the pressure is released and the land subsides.|$|E
50|$|Candy <b>Spots</b> <b>was</b> one of {{the best}} American juveniles of his generation, winning the Arlington-Washington Futurity Stakes among his 3 for 3 record at 2. Candy <b>Spots</b> <b>was</b> undefeated in starts going into the Kentucky Derby.|$|R
50|$|Localized dry spots, more {{commonly}} known as hot <b>spots,</b> <b>are</b> a common occurrence on sand-based turf systems. Hot <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> small areas of turf that are dry and often become hydrophobic. They can be first seen when the grass plants in the area begin to wilt. If the hot <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> not taken care of, the turf in that area will eventually die. Once the soil becomes hydrophobic, {{it is very hard}} to get water to penetrate. The best way to alleviate a hot <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> through long, light irrigation or rainfall. It may also help to use a pitchfork to poke holes into the soil to increase percolation.|$|R
5000|$|A {{total of}} 176 {{international}} roster <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> divided among the 22 clubs. These <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> tradable, such that some clubs {{may have more}} than eight and some clubs may have fewer than eight. There is no limit {{on the number of}} international roster spots on each club's roster. The remaining roster <b>spots</b> must <b>be</b> filled by domestic players.|$|R
5|$|The two-story IDF outpost sat {{northwest}} of the junction. Two six-story Palestinian blocks (known as the twins or twin towers and described variously as offices or apartments) lay directly behind it. South of the junction, diagonally across from the IDF, there was a Palestinian National Security Forces outpost {{under the command of}} Brigadier-General Osama al-Ali, a member of the Palestine National Council. The concrete wall that Jamal and Muhammad crouched against was in front of this building; the <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> less than 120 metres from the most northerly point of the Israeli outpost.|$|E
5|$|After the hot start, a {{prolonged}} slump through January and February occurred {{during which the}} Senators won only seven of 21 games, and Murray fired Head Coach Paddock and Assistant Coach Ron Low on February 27, 2008, taking over the coaching duties himself. After the coaching switch, team performance improved but did not match {{the performance of the}} beginning of the season. A playoff <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> in doubt until the Senators' last game of the season, a loss to Boston, but the team qualified due to the Carolina Hurricanes losing. After all other games were played, the team ended up as the seventh seed and faced the Pittsburgh Penguins in the opening round, a repeat of the 2007 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. The Senators lost the series four games to none, the third time they were swept in a first-round series. The result, after going to the Finals the previous season, led to speculation by the media that the team would make a large change in personnel before next season, including the buy-out of Ray Emery and the Senators not re-signing their free agents.|$|E
5|$|Dundee United's first trophy came in 1925, {{when they}} won the 1924–25 Division Two championship. After two seasons in the top tier, they were relegated, but {{they won the}} Division Two title {{for a second time}} in 1928–29. Immediate relegation {{followed}} and the club finished runners-up in 1931–32. Another runners-up <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> claimed in 1959–60, in manager Jerry Kerr's first season, and from then club remained in the top division for the next 35-years. Under Jim McLean's management, the club won the Premier Division title for the only time, in 1982–83, resulting in European Cup football the following season. The title win was United's last league success, although they finished runners-up in the First Division in 1995–96, after nearly avoiding relegation the previous season, and in third place in their first season back in the Premier Division.|$|E
50|$|It {{is similar}} in forewing and hindwing shape to Hippotion stigma, but the ground colour is much darker. The {{yellowish}} <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> present below the apex and tornus with a very clear W-shaped spot. The discal <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> comma-shaped.|$|R
50|$|From 2014-15 season, new format was introduced. It {{was still}} 20 teams, but 16 <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> awarded to teams from First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina while {{remaining}} 4 <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> filled with teams from cantonal cups.|$|R
50|$|The {{relationship}} between hydrocarbons and direct hydrocarbon indicators, such as bright <b>spots,</b> <b>is</b> not straightforward {{and not all}} bright <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> caused {{by the presence of}} hydrocarbons and therefore they should not be treated as conclusive evidence of hydrocarbon accumulations.|$|R
