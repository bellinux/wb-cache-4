5|$|Samarium was {{discovered}} in 1879 by the French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran and named after the mineral <b>samarskite</b> from which it was isolated. The mineral itself was earlier named after a Russian mine official, Colonel Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets, who thereby became {{the first person to}} have a chemical element named after him, albeit indirectly. Although classified as a rare-earth element, samarium is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth's crust and is more common than such metals as tin. Samarium occurs with concentration up to 2.8% in several minerals including cerite, gadolinite, <b>samarskite,</b> monazite and bastnäsite, the last two being the most common commercial sources of the element. These minerals are mostly found in China, the United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia; China is by far the world leader in samarium mining and production.|$|E
5|$|Boisbaudran {{named his}} element samaria after the mineral <b>samarskite,</b> {{which in turn}} honored Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets (1803–1870).

In this sense samarium was the first chemical element to be named after a person. Later the name samaria used by Boisbaudran was transformed into samarium, to conform with other element names, and samaria nowadays is sometimes {{used to refer to}} samarium oxide, by analogy with yttria, zirconia, alumina, ceria, holmia, etc. The symbol Sm was suggested for samarium; however an alternative Sa was frequently used instead until the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is {{estimated}} to make up about 1ppm or 2ppm of the Earth's crust by weight. There are many species of tantalum minerals, only {{some of which are}} so far being used by industry as raw materials: tantalite, microlite, wodginite, euxenite, polycrase. Tantalite (Fe, Mn)Ta2O6 is the most important mineral for tantalum extraction. Tantalite has the same mineral structure as columbite (Fe, Mn) (Ta, Nb)2O6; when there is more tantalum than niobium it is called tantalite and when there is more niobium than tantalum is it called columbite (or niobite). The high density of tantalite and other tantalum containing minerals makes the use of gravitational separation the best method. Other minerals include <b>samarskite</b> and fergusonite.|$|E

In 1846-47, his brother and colleague-mineralogist Heinrich Rose found that the major component of the mineral is niobium and suggested altering the name to avoid confusion. The newly chosen name <b>samarskite</b> merely acknowledged the role of Samarsky-Bykhovets in granting access to the mineral samples.

The chemical composition of the sample confirmed the affiliation to the <b>samarskite</b> group giving general formula (REE 0. 322 Ca 0. 269 Fe 0. 231 U 0. 142 Mn 0. 031 Pb 0. 011 Th 0. 010 Zr 0. 010 Al 0. 004 Sc 0. 002 Na 0. 001 K 0. 001) Σ 1. 034 (Nb 0. 707 Ta 0. 267 Ti 0. 069 W 0. 017 Sn 0. 007) Σ 1. 067 O 4 which corresponds well to the general ABO 4 stoichiometry of the <b>samarskite</b> group. The structure identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques is well related to the proposed low-temperature <b>samarskite</b> modification (Sugitani et al. 1985) crystallizing in Pbcn space group with the cell parameters a= 5. 69 (2) Å, b= 4. 91 (2) Å, c= 5. 21 (2) Å. The original mineral sample showed to be X-ray amorphous. Gradual recrystallisation in air in the temperature range between 400 and 1000 °C yielded a pyrochlore phase being stable at all experimental temperatures. At 800 °C a high-temperature <b>samarskite</b> phase (s. g. P 2 /c) co-crystallised with an increase in crystallinity at 1000 °C. Recrystallisation in a reducing atmosphere (Ar/H 2) did not yield the high-temperature <b>samarskite</b> phase solely. Unsuccessful recrystallisation of the high-temperature <b>samarskite</b> modification is mainly related to an alteration which shifted the composition of <b>samarskite</b> to pyrochlore as evidenced by occurrence of altered domains in the sample. Raman spectra of thermally untreated <b>samarskite</b> showed generally metamict nature of the mineral, although a few normal Nb-O vibration modes can be resolved indicating BO 6 arrangement similar to the one of columbite.

40|$|The current {{definition}} of samarskite-group minerals suggests that ishikawaite is a uranium rich variety of <b>samarskite</b> whereas calciosamarskite is a calcium rich variety of <b>samarskite.</b> Because these minerals are chemically complex, usually completely metamict, and pervasively altered, their crystal chemistry and structure are poorly understood. Warner and Ewing (1993) proposed that <b>samarskite</b> is an A 3 +B 5 +O 4 mineral with an atomic arrangement related to a-PbO 2. X-ray diffraction {{analyses of the}} recrystallized type specimen of ishikawaite and the Ca-rich <b>samarskite</b> reveal {{that they have the}} same structure as samarskite-(Y) recrystallized at high temperatures. Electron microprobe analyses show that the only significant difference between samarskite-(Y), ishikawaite, and calciosamarskite lies in the occupancy of the A-site. The A-site of samarskite-(Y) is dominated by Y+REE whereas the A-site of ishikawaite is dominantly U+Th and calciosamarskite is dominantly Ca. Additionally, a comparison of these data to those of Warner and Ewing (1993) show that in several cases Fe 2 + or Fe 3 + are dominant in the A-site. We propose that the name samarskite-(REE+Y) should be used when one of these elements is dominant and that the mineral be named with the most abundant of these elements as a suffix. The name ishikawaite should be used only when U+Th are dominant and the name calciosamarskite should only be used when Ca is the dominant cation at the A-site. Finally, because of the inability to quantify the valence state of iron in these minerals, the exact nature of the valence state of iron in these minerals could not be determined in this study...|$|E
