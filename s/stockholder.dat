5|$|Mississippi based Grapico Bottling Company {{troubles}} did not {{end with}} its union problems. In September 1924, John Henry Ennis of Ellisville, Mississippi purchased a Grapico. On drinking it, Ennis discovered that the contents were filled with flies, some of which he swallowed and became sick. On filing a lawsuit against Grapico Bottling Company and its sole <b>stockholder,</b> Philip Carriere, Ennis learned that Grapico Bottling Company had filed for and successfully dissolved itself as a corporation between the time Ennis consumed the flies and filed suit against Grapico Bottling. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Mississippi issued an opinion that serve as precedent in Mississippi for the rule that a <b>stockholder</b> of a corporation is not liable for the debts, liabilities, and other acts of the corporation. After Grapico Bottling Company (Mississippi) dissolved in 1925, Rochell's Grapico Bottling Works became the sole supplier of Grapico to Mississippi.|$|E

40|$|This {{study showed}} the perceptional {{differences}} between corporate managers 1 and <b>stockholders</b> 2 regarding good governance. The study is conducted among 25 pairs of senior managers and <b>stockholders</b> from 25 randomly chosen corporations 3 in Bangladesh. Different statistical tools like numeric scale, discriminant analysis, descriptive analysis, t-test, F-test {{were used for}} the comparative analysis. Regarding good governance, it is found that the corporate managers and <b>stockholders</b> possess opposing view. While managers of the studied firms find governance of their companies is quite well but <b>stockholders</b> view that it is very poor. This happened especially in terms of turnover, production, capital, leverage, debt service, credit policy, solvency, human resource, recruitment, technology, customer satisfaction, internal control, strength, opportunity, competition, industry position, collective bargaining agent (CBA) issues and economic remedies which the study found the groups differ in perception; whereas, they have similar view in terms of adequacy of research fund, company weaknesses and threats, contingency plans, presence of political influence. The managers think that the companies do not have enough retained earnings and these should not be distributed among <b>stockholders,</b> but the <b>stockholders</b> think otherwise. Managers always perceive that they are underpaid whereas <b>stockholders</b> express the opposite view. Each group believes that it is the other group that dominates the decision-making. While both the groups want to have mutual interaction but <b>stockholders</b> want to interact more than the mangers. No doubt this attitudinal differences are not good for smooth functioning of the corporations, what is needed is openness, more dialogues, mutual trust and understanding of each other. The study also noted that corporate managers' tenure is more with the company than a <b>stockholder's</b> holding of stock. It is also found that the managers are better educated than the <b>stockholders.</b> The study observed more male domination both in management position and stockholding of the corporations. Though both of the groups belong to same age level but their distribution shows that the <b>stockholders</b> entering the share market at an early ag...|$|R

5|$|After {{months of}} speculation, on May 23, 1994, Top Rank {{successfully}} purchased the franchise for $152.5 million {{with the intention}} of relocating it to New Orleans. The purchase occurred following an agreement between Top Rank and Timberwolves ownership that allowed Top Rank to purchase the franchise if no local ownership groups were found by May 20, 1994. On June 6, 1994, Top Rank officially filed the paperwork to the NBA seeking to relocate the Timberwolves to New Orleans for the 1994–95 NBA season.

Conversely, when total liabilities are greater than total assets, <b>stockholders</b> have a negative stockholders' equity (negative book value) — also sometimes called stockholders' deficit. A stockholders' deficit {{does not mean that}} <b>stockholders</b> owe money to the corporation as they own only its net assets and are not accountable for its liabilities, though {{it is one of the}} definitions of insolvency. It means that the value of the assets of the company must rise above its liabilities before the <b>stockholders</b> hold positive equity value in the company.|$|R

25|$|Bonds {{and stocks}} are both securities, {{but the major}} {{difference}} between the two is that (capital) <b>stockholders</b> have an equity stake in a company (i.e., they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in the company (i.e., they are lenders). Being a creditor, bondholders have priority over <b>stockholders.</b> This means they will be repaid in advance of <b>stockholders,</b> but will rank behind secured creditors in the event of bankruptcy.|$|R

5|$|In 1902, facing {{cash flow}} problems, John Cleveland Osgood turned to George Jay Gould, a {{principal}} <b>stockholder</b> of the Denver and Rio Grande, for a loan. Gould, via Frederick Taylor Gates, Rockefeller's financial adviser, brought John D. Rockefeller {{in to help}} finance the loan. Analysis of the company's operations by John D.

Control was passed from the Iowa Group to Gould and Rockefeller interests in 1903 with Gould in control and Rockefeller and Gates representing a minority interests.

5|$|UNITA's {{ability to}} mine {{diamonds}} {{and sell them}} abroad provided funding for the war to continue even as the movement's support in the Western world and among the local populace withered away. De Beers and Endiama, a state-owned diamond-mining monopoly, signed a contract allowing De Beers to handle Angola's diamond exports in 1990. According to the United Nation's Fowler Report, Joe De Deker, a former <b>stockholder</b> in De Beers, worked {{with the government of}} Zaire to supply military equipment to UNITA from 1993 to 1997. De Deker's brother, Ronnie, allegedly flew from South Africa to Angola, directing weapons originating in Eastern Europe. In return, UNITA gave Ronnie bushels of diamonds worth $6million. De Deker sent the diamonds to De Beer's buying office in Antwerp, Belgium. De Beers openly acknowledges spending $500million on legal and illegal Angolan diamonds in 1992 alone. The United Nations estimates Angolans made between three and four billion dollars through the diamond trade between 1992 and 1998. The UN also estimates that out of that sum, UNITA made at least $3.72billion, or 93% of all diamond sales, despite international sanctions.|$|E
