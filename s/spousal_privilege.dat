5|$|Because of Peter's {{imprisonment}} Alicia, {{a lawyer}} herself, is {{working as a}} junior associate at a law firm. Alicia serves as second chair for senior partner Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) in a murder trial. Their client, Brad Broussard (Tom Degnan), is charged with shooting Miles Wagner. Wagner was an unpopular mutual fund manager who defrauded Broussard and many other out of their life savings by assisting in Bernard Madoff's investment scandal. Broussard was found covered in blood next to Wagner's body, but insists on his innocence. Diane consults ballistics expert Kurt McVeigh (Gary Cole), a mustachioed country man with a strict principle {{that he will not}} work if the client is guilty. Kurt testifies that Wagner was shot inside a car despite being found on the floor. Wagner's partner, Martin Knox (Kevin O'Rourke), had a strong financial motive to kill Wagner. Knox's wife, Rachel (Geraldine Hughes), strongly dislikes her husband and is willing to implicate him, but is bound by <b>spousal</b> <b>privilege</b> laws. Alicia discovers a conspiracy tactic that will allow Rachel to testify, and Broussard is vindicated and set free. The firm's investigator Kalinda Sharma (Archie Panjabi) visits FBI agent Lana Delaney (Jill Flint) inquiring about the investigation into Peter. Delaney asks Kalinda to feed her information about Peter, but Kalinda declines.|$|E
25|$|At trial, Mrs. Crawford {{could not}} be {{compelled}} to testify by the state, since under Washington's <b>spousal</b> <b>privilege</b> law, a spouse cannot testify in court without the defendant spouse's consent (except when a spouse is a complainant).|$|E
25|$|Defense counsel {{objected to}} the {{admission}} of the wife's statement, {{on the ground that}} Mr. Crawford would be unable to confront (i.e. cross-examine) Mrs. Crawford on her statement without waiving <b>spousal</b> <b>privilege,</b> and {{that this would be a}} violation of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.|$|E
50|$|A <b>spousal</b> {{communications}} <b>privilege</b> applies {{in civil}} and criminal cases.|$|R
50|$|Both {{types of}} {{privilege}} {{are based on}} the policy of encouraging spousal harmony and preventing spouses from having to condemn, or be condemned by, their spouses: the <b>spousal</b> communications <b>privilege</b> or confidences privilege is a form of privileged communication that protects the contents of confidential communications between spouses during their marriage from testimonial disclosure, while <b>spousal</b> testimonial <b>privilege</b> (also called <b>spousal</b> incompetency and spousal immunity) protects the individual holding the privilege from being called to testify in proceedings relating to his/her spouse.|$|R
50|$|Both the witness-spouse and the party-spouse {{hold the}} <b>spousal</b> {{communications}} <b>privilege,</b> so either may invoke it {{to prevent the}} other from testifying about a confidential communication made during marriage.|$|R

Reeves is currently the docket Judge for the Australian Securities and Investment Commission's litigation against the collapsed Storm Financial Ltd.

50|$|Nicky Wilson (Beatty) and Oscar Sullivan (Nicholson) are inept 1920s scam {{artists who}} see pay dirt {{in the guise}} of Fredericka Quintessa Bigard (Stockard Channing), the millionaire heiress to a {{sanitary}} napkin fortune. She loves the already married Nicky, but because the Mann Act prohibits him from taking her across state lines and engaging in immoral relations, he proposes that she marry Oscar and then carry on an affair with the man she wants. Oscar, who is wanted for embezzlement and anxious to get out of town, is happy to comply with the plan, although he intends to claim his <b>spousal</b> <b>privileges</b> after they are wed.|$|R
5000|$|The psychotherapist-patient privilege, {{like the}} attorney-client and <b>spousal</b> <b>privileges,</b> flows from society's desire to {{facilitate}} certain relationships {{of confidence and}} trust. [...] "Effective psychotherapy... depends upon an atmosphere of confidence and trust in which the patient is willing to make a frank and complete disclosure of facts, emotions, memories, and fears. Because of the sensitive nature of the problems for which individuals consult psychotherapists, disclosure of confidential communication made during counseling sessions may cause embarrassment or disgrace. For this reason, the mere possibility of disclosure may impede disclosure of the confidential relationship necessary for successful treatment." [...] These are the important societal interests the psychotherapist-patient privilege works to protect.|$|R
2500|$|In 2011, Gosnell, {{his wife}} Pearl, and eight other clinic {{employees}} were {{charged in the}} case. Eight, including Gosnell's wife, subsequently pleaded guilty, most of whom would testify against Gosnell, and three of these pleaded guilty to third-degree murder, carrying a 20- to 40-year term. [...] A gag order was imposed on both defense and prosecution in April 2011, to bar them from talking to the media before the trial. In December 2011 Pearl Gosnell pleaded guilty to performing illegal abortions, conspiracy, criminal conspiracy and corrupt organization; due to <b>spousal</b> <b>privilege,</b> {{she would not have}} to testify against Gosnell, although she could still go to prison. She had testified to the grand jury that she alone assisted on Sundays, and that her role was to “help do the instruments” in the procedure room and to monitor patients in the recovery room. Another employee testified that she assisted with late-term abortions “on Sundays or days we were closed [...] do special cases.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The series finale {{picked up}} where the {{previous}} episode left off, where Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) and Bart argue on the roof ending with Bart falling off the building. Chuck and Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) leave the scene and hide from the police as Chuck is considered [...] "a person of interest" [...] in the case. Jack Bass (Desmond Harrington), Chuck's uncle, comes to help him and suggests the two get married since <b>spousal</b> <b>privilege</b> prevents a wife from unwillingly testifying against her husband. Chuck thus proposes to Blair who tearfully accepts. Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively) discovers the alternate chapter about her that Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley) wrote and put in her bag before she left for Los Angeles. She reads the chapter and decides to stay in New York to confront Dan. William van der Woodsen (William Baldwin) shows up to support Lily Bass (Kelly Rutherford) and tells Ivy Dickens (Kaylee DeFer) that he used her {{to get back to}} Lily.|$|E
2500|$|On February 26, 2004, O'Donnell married Kelli Carpenter, {{a former}} Nickelodeon {{marketing}} executive, in San Francisco {{two weeks after}} San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom authorized the granting of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Her {{decision to go to}} San Francisco to marry Carpenter was seen as a show of defiance against then-U.S. President George W. Bush over his support for the Federal Marriage Amendment. She said in 2004, [...] "We were both inspired to come here after the sitting President made the vile and hateful comments he made ... ne thought ran through my mind on the plane out here – with liberty and justice for all." [...] The couple was married by San Francisco Treasurer Susan Leal, one of the city's highest ranking lesbian officials, and serenaded by the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus. O'Donnell said during the trial over Rosie magazine she had decided to marry Carpenter, in part because even though they acted as spouses they legally were no closer than friends: [...] "We applied for <b>spousal</b> <b>privilege</b> and were denied it by the state. As a result, everything that I said to Kelli, every letter that I wrote her, every e-mail, every correspondence and conversation was entered into the record ... I am now and will forever be a total proponent of gay marriage." ...|$|E
5000|$|Under U.S. federal common law, the <b>spousal</b> {{testimonial}} <b>privilege</b> {{is held by}} the witness-spouse, not the party-spouse, {{and therefore}} does not prevent a spouse who wishes to testify from doing so. [...] The rationale of this rule {{is that if a}} witness-spouse desires to testify against the party-spouse, there is no marital harmony left to protect through the obstruction of such testimony. This common law principle is the view in a minority of U.S. states. A majority of U.S. jurisdictions, however, do not follow U.S. federal common law; in most states, the party-spouse, and not the witness-spouse, is the holder of <b>spousal</b> testimonial <b>privilege.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Spousal</b> {{testimonial}} <b>privilege</b> may not {{be invoked}} if the spouses are suing each other or each other's estates in a civil case; {{if one of the}} spouses has initiated a criminal proceeding against the other; or in a competency proceeding regarding one of the spouses.|$|R
50|$|The most {{prevalent}} {{research on the}} topic on intimate-partner relationships pertains to heterosexual romantic relationships with one incarcerated partner. Due to recent legislation in the United States, homosexual married couples in the United States receive equivalent <b>spousal</b> <b>privileges</b> as heterosexual married couples regarding criminal trials and testifying. These rights are reflected regarding contact with spouses while incarcerated (e.g. conjugal visits). That being said, California, Connecticut, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York, and Washington are the only six states that allow conjugal visits. Of these, only Mississippi denies married homosexual coupes the privilege of conjugal visits LGBT rights in the United States. Therefore, IPRs with one incarcerated partner will {{be referred to as}} such regardless of the sexual orientation of the couple.|$|R

50|$|The <b>spousal</b> {{communications}} <b>privilege</b> may not {{be invoked}} if the spouses are suing each other or each other's estates in a civil case; {{if one of the}} spouses has initiated a criminal proceeding against the other; or in a competency proceeding regarding one of the spouses. These three scenarios are identical to the limitations which also apply to limit the <b>spousal</b> testimonial <b>privilege.</b> Two further scenarios apply to defeat the attachment of the spousal communications privilege: if the confidential communication was made in order to plan or commit crime or fraud, or if a defendant-spouse wishes, in a criminal trial, to testify in their own defense, about a confidential marital communication. In these five cases, a court will not allow either spouse to assert the privilege to block the testimony.|$|R
5000|$|On February 10, 2014, the Justice Department {{instructed}} all of {{its employees}} to give lawful same-sex marriages {{the same rights as}} heterosexual married couples in all programs it administers, whether or not the activity occurs in a jurisdiction that recognizes same-sex marriage. Included are the right to decline to testify against a spouse, <b>spousal</b> <b>privileges</b> for prison inmates, eligibility for joint bankruptcy filing, and access to such federal programs as the Sep 11 fund to compensate victims of the terrorist attacks and the compensation program for the surviving spouse of a public safety officer killed in the line of duty. The policy also affects domestic support obligations, such as alimony owed to a former same-sex spouse, as well as the exclusion of certain debts to a current or former same-sex spouse.|$|R
50|$|The witness-spouse may invoke {{testimonial}} privilege regarding events which occurred (1) during the marriage, if the spouses are still married; and (2) {{prior to the}} marriage if he is married to his spouse in court proceedings {{at the time of}} trial. If, by the time the trial occurs, the spouses are no longer married, the former spouse-witness may testify freely about any events which occurred prior to, after, or even during the marriage. <b>Spousal</b> testimonial <b>privilege,</b> in other words, only lasts as long as the marriage does.|$|R
