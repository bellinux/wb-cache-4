40|$|As of today, {{software}} development does not revolve around {{a piece of}} source code but also around large volume of software project related information that exists in different <b>software</b> <b>repositories</b> hosting a <b>software</b> project. These <b>software</b> <b>repositories</b> produce a variety of software artifacts (i. e., source code, bugs, source control commit logs, emails, documentation etc.) during the whole {{software development}} lifecycle. Apart from the software project information that is distributed across different <b>software</b> <b>repositories</b> of a <b>software</b> project, software project related information is also distributed on the Web in heterogeneous open source <b>software</b> <b>repositories.</b> Examples of these open source <b>software</b> <b>repositories</b> are: collaborative infrastructure for software project development (i. e., code forges), social networking infrastructure (e. g., Twitter) to disseminate software project related information to a wider audience and statistical services that provides statistical information about software project development. Hence, {{we can say that}} information related to software projects are distributed on the Web. The information contained inside these heterogeneous <b>software</b> <b>repositories</b> is vital to software stakeholders for their day to day development needs. However, this information is not readily accessible due to the distributed nature and lack of integration among <b>software</b> <b>repositories.</b> In this thesis, we propose to integrate <b>software</b> <b>repositories</b> by exploiting a Linked Data approach that allows an easy integration and identification of related information about software artifacts across heterogeneous <b>software</b> <b>repositories.</b> We start by describing our approach to publish and integrate <b>software</b> <b>repositories</b> (based on <b>software</b> artifacts) using Linked Data and show how the interlinked information can be delivered to software stakeholders in their development environments. Further, we present our approach to identify and interlink different and multiple IDs of a software developer, which he/she uses to interact with different <b>software</b> <b>repositories</b> of a <b>software</b> project. Moreover, we present some use case scenarios that can be realized by interlinking multiple IDs of a software developer. With respect to hosting of software projects on publicly available development infrastructures (i. e., code forges), we propose to integrate different code forges based on metadata, similar software projects and software developers. We demonstrate the integration of software project and software developer related information across different code forges as well as relevant information that are available through statistical services. Further, we show that it enables software stakeholders to not only query statistical information about a software project as well as software developer but also allow them {{to keep track of the}} involvement of software developers in multiple software projects across different code forges. In regards to the social aspects, we present evidence that software project and software developer related information also exists on social media channels. Based on our case study of the usage of Twitter by software developers, we motivate the integration of social media channels and <b>software</b> <b>repositories.</b> Finally, we exploit our linked datasets to investigate the evolving social dependencies and social relations among software developers over the period of time...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Open source {{projects}} for example Eclipse and Firefox have open source bug repositories. User reports bugs to these repositories. Users of these repositories are usually non-technical and cannot assign correct class to these bugs. Triaging of bugs, to developer, {{to fix them}} is a tedious and time consuming task. Developers are usually expert in particular areas. For example, few developers are expert in GUI and others are in java functionality. Assigning a particular bug to relevant developer could save time and would help to maintain the interest level of developers by assigning bugs according to their interest. However, assigning right bug to right developer is quite difficult for tri-ager without knowing the actual class, the bug belongs to. In this research, we have classified the bugs in different labels {{on the basis of}} summary of the bug. Multinomial Naïve Byes text classifier is used for classification purpose. For feature selection, Chi-Square and TFIDF algorithms were used. Using Naïve Bayes and Chi- square, we get average of 83 % accuracy Key-Words: Text mining, classification, <b>software</b> <b>repositories,</b> open source <b>software</b> projects, triaging, feature 1. 1 Mining <b>Software</b> <b>Repositories</b> To understand constantly evolving software systems is a very daunting task.
