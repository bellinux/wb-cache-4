40|$|AbstractIn this paper, an activity-based {{bottleneck}} {{model with}} staggered work hours (SWHs) is proposed. Commuters’ departure time choice {{is assumed to}} follows user equilibrium (UE) principle in terms of total activity utility. The equilibrium departure rates of the activity-based bottleneck model with both single work <b>start</b> <b>time</b> and double work <b>start</b> <b>times</b> are analytically derived. Analytical results show {{that there are three}} possible travel patterns for the bottleneck model with double work <b>start</b> <b>times,</b> and the formulations of the departure rates with respect to double work <b>start</b> <b>times</b> are the same as that with respect to single work <b>start</b> <b>time.</b> However, SWHs indeed change commuters’ travel choice behavior, and can result alternative cumulative departure flows...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{elucidate}} the impact of earlier school <b>start</b> <b>times</b> on elementary school children. Research demonstrates that adolescents are chronically sleep deprived due to shifting biological rhythms and early school <b>start</b> <b>times.</b> As a result, some schools have restructured their schedules to allow for later <b>start</b> <b>times</b> for {{middle and high school}} students. This change has inadvertently resulted in earlier <b>start</b> <b>times</b> for the elementary school students. Although studies demonstrate a positive impact of later <b>start</b> <b>times</b> for adolescents, no studies have examined younger children. This project, therefore, examined the effect of an earlier <b>start</b> <b>time</b> on the sleep patterns of elementary school students, as well as assessed correlations between sleep and cognitive functioning. Two groups of second graders (an experimental and control group) were followed for one-year; one experienced an earlier school <b>start</b> <b>time</b> in third grade, and the other did not. Measures of actigraphy and survey data were obtained. Results demonstrated that changing to an earlier school <b>start</b> <b>time</b> may cause school-aged children to obtain less quality of sleep, and experience a higher rate of daytime sleepiness. Because of the limited sample size included in this study, results are dependent on a larger scale experiment which will be completed within the next year...|$|R
40|$|Duration and <b>start</b> <b>time</b> of {{respirometry}} {{experiments have}} significant {{effects on the}} measurement of basal values for several commonly measured physiological variables (metabolic rate, evaporative water loss and body temperature). A longer measurement duration reduced values for all variables for all <b>start</b> <b>times,</b> and this was an effect of reduced animal activity rather than random sampling. However, {{there was also an}} effect of circadian rhythm on the timing of minimal physiological values. Experiment <b>start</b> <b>time</b> had a significant effect on time taken to reach minimal values for all variables, ranging from 0400 hours ± 38 min (body temperature, <b>start</b> <b>time</b> 2300 hours) to 0854 hours ± 52 min (evaporative water loss, <b>start</b> <b>time</b> 1700 hours). It also influenced the time of day that minimal values were obtained, ranging from 2224 hours ± 40 min (carbon dioxide production, <b>start</b> <b>time</b> 1500 hours) to 0600 hours ± 57 min (oxygen consumption, <b>start</b> <b>time</b> 2300 hours), and the minimum values measured. Consequently, both the measurement duration and the experiment <b>start</b> <b>time</b> should be considered in experimental design to account for both a handling and a circadian effect on the animal’s physiology. We suggest that experiments to measure standard physiological variables for small diurnal birds should commence between 1700 and 2100 hours, and measurement duration should be at least 9 h. 9 page(s...|$|R

5000|$|When a new {{batch job}} is submitted, the {{scheduler}} searches available nodes (Step.1). After the nodes and the estimated <b>start</b> <b>time</b> are {{allocated to the}} batch job, stage-in process starts (Step.2). The job waits until the estimated <b>start</b> <b>time</b> after stage-in process is finished. If the scheduler find the earlier <b>start</b> <b>time</b> than the estimated <b>start</b> <b>time,</b> it allocates the new <b>start</b> <b>time</b> to the batch job. This process is called [...] "Job Escalation" [...] (Step.3). When the estimated <b>start</b> <b>time</b> has arrived, the scheduler executes the batch job (Step.4). The scheduler terminates the batch job and starts stage-out process after the job execution is finished or the declared elapsed time is over (Step.5).To execute the batch job, the user logs into the login-server and submits the batch script to ES. And the user waits until the job execution is done. During that time, the user can see {{the state of the}} batch job using the conventional web browser or user commands. The node scheduling, the file staging and other processing are automatically processed by the system according to the batch script.|$|R
30|$|The {{decoding}} scheme turns an encoded solution into a schedule. We set the <b>starting</b> <b>time</b> of {{the first}} job in part 1 as 0. Then, to find the earliest possible <b>starting</b> <b>time</b> of the subsequent job, we first set the <b>starting</b> <b>time</b> to be 0. The first operation of that job is scheduled. If any overlap happens between this operation and previously scheduled operations on the same machine, the <b>starting</b> <b>time</b> is set to as the first possible <b>starting</b> <b>time</b> that avoids any overlap. The second operation in the processing route of the job is then scheduled. Again, if any overlap occurs between this operation and previously scheduled operations on that machine, we have to restart from the first operation in order to hold no buffer constraints. The procedure repeats until all {{the operations of the}} job are scheduled.|$|R
40|$|Local {{school districts}} often stagger daily <b>start</b> <b>times</b> for their schools {{in order to}} reduce busing costs.

Using variation in <b>start</b> <b>times</b> within and across schools, I find that starting school one hour later leads to a three percentile point gain in both math and reading test scores. Using only variation in <b>start</b> <b>times</b> within schools over time, the effect is a two percentile point gain.

40|$|A mixed-integer {{program is}} {{presented}} for scheduling canal irrigation {{among a group}} of users where the duration of flow of each outlet and a target <b>start</b> <b>time</b> is specified by the users. Two models are developed. The first is a single-period model which uses as input a minimized demand {{at the head of the}} canal. This will allow the discharge at the head of the canal to be set once at the beginning of the irrigation period. Within this constraint, the single-period model minimizes the sum over all outlets of the difference between the scheduled <b>start</b> <b>time</b> of flow to each user and the requested target <b>start</b> <b>times.</b> The second model is a multiperiod model. This model favors those users who had been disadvantaged in the previous irrigation periods by giving them priority in scheduling their actual <b>start</b> <b>times</b> with target <b>start</b> <b>times</b> for the subsequent irrigation period.
