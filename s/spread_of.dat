5|$|In February 2016, in {{response}} to the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the Zika virus, the Obama administration requested that Congress appropriate $1.9billion to fight the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the disease. Congress did not initially take action, leaving Burwell to direct the Department of Health and Human Services to reprogram $589million in funds previously designated as part of the response to Ebola, to fight the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the Zika virus. Of the initial Zika funding, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) received $222million to lead the domestic fight against the virus with the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority splitting $152million for the domestic effort. In response to Congressional complaints that the money was not being spent fast enough, Burwell informed Congress that without further funding the CDC's funding to fight Zika would be depleted by September30, 2016. After Burwell moved funding from other HHS programs, Congress finally appropriated $1.1billion to fight the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> Zika in the United States. By the end of September 2016, the United States reported 23,000 cases in the territory of Puerto Rico, 3,000 cases in the states, and 21babies born in the United States with microcephaly testing positive for Zika.|$|E
5|$|The Neolithic age, {{which began}} in the Middle East in about 9500BC, was a time when humans became farmers.

By using the theory <b>of</b> asymptotic <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> nonautonomous equations, the asymptotic speeds <b>of</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> unknown functions formulated by a coupled system are estimated. Our results imply that the asymptotic <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> one species can be significantly fastened by introducing a mutual species, which indicates the role of cooperation described by the coupled nonlinearities.

5|$|The <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> {{disease was}} {{significantly}} more rampant {{in areas of}} poverty. Epidemics ravaged cities, particularly children. Plagues were easily spread by lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation. Children were hit the hardest because many diseases, such as typhus and syphilis, target the immune system, leaving young children without a fighting chance.

5|$|Armillaria luteobubalina {{was first}} {{described}} in 1978, {{after having been}} discovered several years earlier growing in a Eucalyptus plantation in southeastern Australia. It distinguished itself from other known Australian Armillaria species by its aggressive pathogenicity. It may take years for infected trees {{to show signs of}} disease, leading to an underestimation of disease prevalence. Studies show that the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> disease in eucalypt forests is associated with infected stumps left following logging operations. Although several methods have been suggested to control the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> disease, they are largely economically or environmentally unfeasible. Phylogenetic analyses have determined that A.luteobubalina is closely related to A.montagnei and that both of these species are in turn closely related to the Brazilian species A.paulensis. The distribution of A.luteobubalina suggests that it is an ancient species that originated before the separation of the precursor supercontinent Gondwana.|$|E
