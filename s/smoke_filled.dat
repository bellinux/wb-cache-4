40|$|More than 35 % of atria in Hong Kong can be {{classified}} as linear with large transverse dimensions. The <b>smoke</b> <b>filling</b> process due to fires in these atria was studied.

25|$|Commander John Charles Dalrymple Hay led the Royal Navy vessels which {{encountered}} Chui A-poo's fleet. His {{ship was}} the 12-gun brig HMS Columbine, with about 80 crewmen and 20 marines. The steamer Canton also participated, her number of crew and armament {{is not known}} but she was chartered and armed by a Lieutenant Bridges from the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. She arrived unsuspected at the battle area and assisted in attacking the pirates. On 27 September 1849, the Columbine left Hong Kong for Harlaim Bay and arrived at noon the following day. There they found the village to have been attacked and burnt by the pirates, who fled further northeast {{to the village of}} Tysami so the expedition went further until within plain view of the village.

25|$|To the west, Maréchal Bernadotte, {{in command}} of the Saxon IX Corps, was {{preparing}} his own assault, planning to attack the Austrians at Deutsch-Wagram from the west. This attack was delayed, as Bernadotte had to wait for the arrival of Zezschwitz's division, but at around 21:00 the Saxons moved towards the village. As Lecoq's Saxon brigade approached the position, they were instantly met with sustained musketry fire from the Austrian defenders, two battalions of infantry regiment 17 (Reuss-Plauen) and the 2nd Jäger regiment, but the Saxons pushed on and entered the village. Once they reached the vicinity of the village church, the Saxons were steadily met by the third battalion of infantry regiment 17 and the attack at once broke down, with the attackers forced to take shelter in the buildings nearby. Moments later, Zeschau's Saxon brigade, with Prince Maximilian's regiment attached to it, came in support, but these troops had been much disordered when crossing the Russbach, and upon entering the <b>smoke</b> <b>filled</b> streets of the village, they too lost impetus. With visibility much reduced by smoke, the situation at Deutsch-Wagram soon turned into chaos as all the troops inside spoke German and all, except the Austrian Jägers, wore white uniforms. There were thus several instances in which Saxon troops fired at each other and their situation took {{a turn for the worse}} towards 22:30, when Generalmajor Hartizsch brought fresh Saxon troops against the position. Hartizsch was not informed that friendly troops were already in the village and, as he was coming up for the attack, he saw a large number of white-coats moving out of the position. The commander at once ordered his men to fire and minutes of friendly fire and hand-to-hand combat ensued before it became obvious that these men were actually Saxons too. This fortuitous event had a significant impact on the attack, as the Saxons in the village now thought themselves surrounded and at once broke and retreated in disorder. The Saxon troops of the IX Corps were now completely demoralised and any attempts to rally and reform them at Aderklaa towards 23:00 failed.|$|E

Within five minutes, the aircraft's fire extinguishers were depleted, electrical power was lost and <b>smoke</b> <b>filled</b> the cockpit {{to the point that the}} pilots could not read their instruments. As the situation worsened, the captain realized he would not be able to land the aircraft and told the crew to prepare to abandon it.

40|$|Numerical {{studies on}} hot smoke tests {{at an airport}} {{terminal}} were performed. In that airport terminal, field measurements on the <b>smoke</b> <b>filling</b> process with and without operating the ventilation system were {{carried out in the}} actual site, giving sufficient experimental results for verifying fire models. In this paper, a fire field model is assessed. The computational fluid dynamics program selected was CC-EXACT, a package modified from the EXACT program developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The fire was taken as a heat source with two sets of numerical simulations carried out. The first set was on natural <b>smoke</b> <b>filling</b> for understanding the <b>smoke</b> <b>filling</b> process when the ventilation system is shut down. The second set was on assessing the performance of the mechanical ventilation system. Results predicted by the field model are compared with those measured at the site. It is found that results predicted from this computational fluid dynamics program agreed reasonably well with th ose experimental data.

40|$|The {{concept of}} using a time constant, a {{parameter}} describing the <b>smoke</b> <b>filling</b> process including atrium geometry and design of the fire, is further reviewed. Time constants of 138 local atria were investigated. The <b>smoke</b> <b>filling</b> time required to fill 80 % of the space volume of 69 atria to satisfy the criteria for applying the NFPA <b>smoke</b> <b>filling</b> equation was evaluated with a slow t 2 -fire. The two-layer zone model ASET was {{used to calculate the}} <b>smoke</b> <b>filling</b> time for all 138 atria. The time for the smoke front to reach the ceiling is included to modify the calculation. The time constant has to be considered with the maximum allowed population density at the atrium floor.

It is confirmed that time constant is a better parameter than space volume that is used in the current fire codes, and is thus recommended to the Authority for smoke management in atria.

40|$|ABSTRACT Experimental {{studies on}} fire <b>smoke</b> <b>filling</b> in an atrium {{were carried out}} in a new {{full-scale}} burning facility: the USTC/PolyU Atrium. Three kind of pool size was designed: discs with diameter of O. 6 m and I. Om, square tray with side length of 2. 0 m. The pools were located at the floor with all the windows and vents of the atrium closed, leaving just a horizontal gap near the floor for supplying fresh air. Transient mass losses of the burning fuel, vertical temperature distributions and descending time of the smoke layer were measured. A simple model based on the zone model was compared with the tests and some <b>smoke</b> <b>filling</b> models appeared in the literature.

500|$|The video {{opens with}} the view of a city {{populated}} with skyscrapers, intermingling railway lines and aero-crafts. Steam blows out of the funnels of a factory as big machines are shown. Madonna, wearing black lingerie, appears {{on the back of}} a statue of an angry looking swan, and utters the line: [...] "Come on girls, do you believe in love?"

Amidst the <b>smoke</b> <b>filled</b> environment, the chiseled torso of the male workers are shown, as they strip off their shirts, with water splashing all around. Madonna is then shown in a light-green gown, holding a black cat in her lap, looking across the factory from her sitting room of her penthouse office. As she sings the first verse, the workers perform choreographed dance routine inside the factory. Madonna lies down on a sofa and the cat escapes from her lap, as her singing reaches the owner of the factory, through a series of speakers. He becomes nervous hearing her voice and looks down to find one of the workers staring up and looking for the source of the voice.|$|E
500|$|The name, [...] "Britannia" [...] {{was chosen}} in April 1950 with Britannia 101 the {{designation}} for first two prototypes {{powered by the}} early series Proteus 625, the follow-up from the 600 series engine that had successfully completed its type trials. The first prototype, registered G-ALBO, with Bristol Chief Test Pilot A.J. [...] "Bill" [...] Pegg at the controls, flew {{for the first time}} on 16 August 1952 at Filton Aerodrome. The maiden flight was eventful as the over-sensitive flying controls led to a wild pitching before Pegg restored control. During the landing approach, <b>smoke</b> <b>filled</b> the cockpit and the main undercarriage bogie was stuck in its cycle, only fully deploying seconds before landing. The [...] "snags" [...] proved to be minor and by September, the prototype was cleared to perform at the 1952 SBAC Display at Farnborough where spectators commented on the [...] "quietness" [...] of the giant airliner. In November 1952, Popular Science reported that by 1954 BOAC would have 25 of these aircraft on routes such as London-to-Tokyo over the Arctic and North Pole. However, in 1953 and 1954, three de Havilland Comets crashed without explanation, and the Air Ministry demanded the Britannia undergo lengthy tests. Further delays were attributed to teething problems with the engine resulting in the loss in December 1953 of the second prototype, G-ALRX, caused by a failed reduction gear that led to an engine fire and the aircraft landing on the mudflats of the Severn Estuary. Resolving easily avoidable inlet icing issues – by selecting a slightly different cruising height than that specified – which were exaggerated by BOAC destroying the Britannia's sales prospects and delaying the Britannia's introduction by two years, also took time. The first prototype G-ALBO was subsequently modified to more closely approximate a production standard but was retained by the company to undergo engine testing and development.|$|E

The war lasted for only another four years during which some remnants of the Song held up last desperate defenses. In 1277, 250 defenders under Lou Qianxia conducted a suicide bombing and set off a huge iron bomb when it became clear defeat was imminent. Of this, the History of Song writes, [...] "the noise was like a tremendous thunderclap, shaking the walls and ground, and the <b>smoke</b> <b>filled</b> up the heavens outside.

2500|$|On 18 November 1996, at 21:48 CET a fire about 2m by 2m (6ft by 6ft) {{was seen}} on HGV Shuttle No. 7539, {{carrying}} 31 passengers and three crew, as it entered the French portal.

After stopping, power from the overhead line was lost and <b>smoke</b> <b>filled</b> the tunnel; crew members could not see the service tunnel doors. Smoke began to enter the coach and the crew and passengers suffered from smoke inhalation. The supplementary ventilation system was turned on and ran for seven minutes with the blades set incorrectly. Once the blades were set correctly, the smoke cleared sufficiently for the passengers and crew to evacuate. Twenty six passengers and the driver were taken out of the tunnel by a tourist shuttle that had stopped in the adjacent running tunnel. The remaining people were treated on site before being evacuated via the service tunnel. All passengers and crew were taken to a hospital in France for observation.|$|E
40|$|The <b>smoke</b> <b>filling</b> {{process in}} the atria of {{shopping}} malls in Hong Kong is studied. The atrium is located adjacent to a shop which is assumed to have a fire. Atria classified into seven different shapes with volumes varying from 2, 500 to 35, 000 m 3 were considered. The <b>smoke</b> <b>filling</b> time in those atria was simulated by the fire zone model CFAST Version 2. 0. A total number of 63 atria were considered with the probable fire environment simulated. A time constant derived from the free plume expressions is proposed to specify the geometry of the atrium hall for studying the <b>smoke</b> <b>filling</b> process. It is found that the times required to fill 80 % and 50 % of the atrium space volume with smoke are related to this time constant. Linear relations between them were derived.

40|$|The {{performance}} efficiency of natural smoke ventilation in atria spaces are influenced greatly by several design decisions such as atrium shape, height, size and openings location. This paper investigates {{the impact of}} atrium shape (horizontal profile) on smoke ventilation performance in naturally ventilated atria. Three different configurations (square, rectangular and triangular prism) with the same area, height, and hence, volume were tested. The smoke ventilation performance is being assessed in terms of <b>smoke</b> <b>filling</b> time using a computational fire dynamic simulator (FDS). FDS is used to simulate the natural <b>smoke</b> <b>filling</b> resulting from atrium fire in the three configurations. The smoke layer interface height {{as a function of}} time and soot mass fraction and temperature as a function of height have been registered during the simulation. The predicted transport lag time for initial formation of the smoke layer beneath the ceiling (ceiling jet) was compared for the three tests. In order to test sensitivity of the shapes, all other parameters were designed to be similar in the three tests, and the same fire scenario was applied including inlet and outlet area, and fire size and location. The results showed that the rectangular configuration contributes better to smoke ventilation, and that the triangular configuration is the most critical in terms of <b>smoke</b> <b>filling</b> time, followed by the square configuration...|$|R
