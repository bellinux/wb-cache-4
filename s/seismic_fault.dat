5|$|Two hazards {{are uniquely}} {{identified}} with the dam. One is that sedimentation projections are not agreed upon, {{and the other is}} that the dam sits on a <b>seismic</b> <b>fault.</b> At current levels, 80% of the land in the area is experiencing erosion, depositing about 40million tons of sediment into the Yangtze annually. Because the flow is slower above the dam, much of this sediment will now settle there instead of flowing downstream, and there will be less sediment downstream.|$|E
5|$|The dam {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the 1950s; construction work commenced in 1968, involving the diversion of the North Fork American River through a tunnel {{and the construction of}} a massive earthen cofferdam. Following a nearby earthquake and the discovery of a <b>seismic</b> <b>fault</b> that underlay the dam site, work on the project was halted for fears that the dam's design would not allow it to survive a major quake on the same fault zone. Although the dam was redesigned and a new proposal submitted by 1980, spiraling costs and limited economic justification {{put an end to the}} project until severe flooding in 1986 briefly renewed interest in Auburn's flood control potential. The California State Water Resources Control Board denied water rights for the dam project in 2008 due to lack of construction progress.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn an ophiolitic nappe of Alpine Corsica, a major {{fault zone}} superimposes metagabbro over serpentinite and peridotite. Ductile and brittle {{deformation}} structures are {{observed in the}} fault damage zones. In the metagabbro damage zone, early deformation culminates in blueschist or eclogite facies conditions and consists of west-verging mylonitization alternating with pseudotachylyte-forming faulting with undetermined vergence. This early deformation is likely coeval with west-verging <b>seismic</b> (pseudotachylyte-forming) reverse <b>faulting</b> in the footwall peridotite or with aseismic distributed cataclastic deformation of footwall serpentinite. These early events (aseismic mylonitization or distributed cataclasis and <b>seismic</b> <b>faulting)</b> are interpreted as reverse faulting/shear in an east-dipping subducting oceanic lithosphere in Cretaceous to Eocene times. Late deformation events consist of ductile shear and <b>seismic</b> <b>faulting</b> having occurred under retrograde greenschist conditions. Kinematics of the ductile shear is top-to-the-east. These events are interpreted {{as the result of}} syn-to post-collision extension of Alpine Corsica in Eocene to Miocene times. The heterogeneous distribution of pseudotachylyte veins along the fault zone (abundant at peridotite-metagabbro interfaces, rare or absent at serpentinite-metagabbro interfaces) is interpreted as the consequence of contrasted frictional properties of the rocks in contact. High-friction peridotite-metagabbro contacts could correspond to asperities whereas low-friction serpentinite-metagabbro contacts could correspond to creeping zones...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, the {{exploitation}} of hydrocarbons reserves in deep seas and oceans, {{in combination with the}} need to transport hydrocarbons among countries, has made the design, construction and operation of offshore pipelines very significant. Under this perspective, it is evident that many more offshore pipelines are expected to be constructed in the near future and in particular in the wider Mediterranean region. Given the fact that offshore pipelines are crossing extended areas, they may face a variety of geo-hazards that cause substantial permanent ground deformations and potentially threaten the integrity of the pipeline. The present study focuses on the impact of permanent ground deformations induced by active <b>seismic</b> <b>faults</b> on offshore pipelines. For this purpose, a numerical simulation (through finite-element modeling and strain-based criteria) is made, in order to study the distress of offshore pipelines subjected to PGDs induced by active normal and reverse <b>seismic</b> <b>faults</b> at the seabed. Factors, such as the geometrical properties of the fault, the mechanical properties of the ruptured soil formations, and the pipeline characteristics, are examined. Beginning with an extended introduction to the subject, by presenting some general aspects of offshore pipelines and marine geo-hazards, the problem under investigation and the motivation of the study are explained. Subsequently the geo-hazard of <b>seismic</b> <b>faults</b> is further analyzed as well as the special seismic characteristics of the Mediterranean region. After a literature review on similar researches, a validation of the numerical model, developed in the present study, is performed, through the comparison of the numerical results with the analytical predictions of another study. Having validated the numerical model, a range of critical parameters is examined and their impact on the pipeline is presented. After some interesting conclusions regarding the seismic vulnerability of offshore pipelines, potential cost-effective mitigation measures are proposed taking into account constructability issues...|$|R
