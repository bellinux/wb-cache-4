40|$|Benchmarking is {{a method}} {{used to measure the}} products, {{services}} and processes in comparison to an entity recognized as a leader in terms of performance of its operations. Used in the years 1970 - 1980 in the strategic management of the company currently has proven to be increasingly useful in many areas, including in international analysis models. In the European Union benchmarking indicators are used especially in the digital economy and as perspective indicators for 2011 - 2015 (Eurostat, Database). In the introduction we present and define forms of benchmarking, {{as well as a number}} of specific terms, which contribute to a better understanding of the content of this scientific work. Time series are used to highlight advances in labor productivity in EU countries, and the analysis is particularized for two countries: Romania and Germany. Quantitative data were collected from the <b>source</b> <b>Eurostat</b> website. A comprehensive indicator at macroeconomic level is resource productivity, representing GDP in relation with domestic consumption of material (DCM). DCM measures the amount of materials used directly by an economy. It is presented in tabular form for all European Union countries and Switzerland, as evolving over a period of eight years. Benchmarking method is used to highlight some differences (gaps) between EU countries regarding productivity and particularly the one between Germany and Romania is highlighted, concerning the performance of manufacturing industries. It is expected that this gap will diminish. The gap was highlighted by relevant graphics and interpretations. The second part of the paper focuses on comparative analysis of factors productivity using the production function. We analyze labor and capital productivity and other factors that determine the level of production. For highlighting the contribution of the labour factor we used the number of hours worked, considering that it reflects the analyzed phenomenon more realistically. For highlighting the contribution of capital factor we used as an indicator the capital stock in euros, available for Germany in the Eurostat database, and for Romania in the Statistical Yearbook 2009, expressed in RON, as comparable prices and then converted into euros at the average rate calculated by the NBR. The results for the entire manufacturing industry represent the basis for further expansion of benchmarking to the main components of this industry, especially automobile building, transportation vechicules, furniture, clothing, leather chemical, etc [...] , providing a scientific basis to fundament the economic policies including commercial ones. benchmarking, labour productivity, resource productivity, capital productivity, sustainable development strategy...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to shed some light on European {{regional}} diversity in terms of knowledge accumulation and socio-economic performances. Dynamic links between knowledge, innovation and performance are complex to address because they take place in different contexts, involving heterogeneous agents interacting through different institutions. Studies on national systems of innovation (Edquist, 1997) stressed the role of the institutional context in these dynamics and identify various configurations associated with these national systems. This conceptual framework, used at the regional level, leads to the identification of regional systems of innovation (Cooke, 2001) and thus underlines the limits of a regional scoreboard only based on high-tech indicators as it is usually proposed. This paper constitutes a first attempt to propose a more exhaustive effort in characterizing the diversity of "regional knowledge an innovation systems" within Europe. The study is performed through data analysis using the conceptual framework of "social systems of innovation and production" (SSIP) proposed by Amable, Barré and Boyer (1997). A Social System of Innovation and Production can be defined as a coherent combination of different components referring to Science-technology-industry (STI) configurations articulated with financial system, labour relations, education and training and economic performances. This framework can be adapted at the regional level by identifying specific arrangements of each part of the system even if the concept of system is questionable at this level. The analysis is performed combining data from three <b>sources</b> (<b>Eurostat,</b> the Cambridge Econometrics database and OST (Observatoire des Sciences et des Techniques)) over a sample of NUTS-II european regions and using multivariate data analysis (principal component analysis, hierarchical anova). Putting together the SSIP and local economic performances allows defining different regional configurations in order to identify regional trajectories and patterns of articulation between knowledge dynamics and performance. Our hypothesis is that regional growth in not a problem of best practice but of coherent knowledge combination: institutional differences may lead similar (or different) STI structures to different (respectively same) performances.

40|$|Accessibility is {{a greatly}} {{significant}} concept for evaluating spatial interactions and transport systems attractiveness. The ability to accurately measure accessibility {{is becoming more}} and more crucial for setting up policies aimed to increase the competitiveness of a transport system by fostering resource efficient modes such as rail. Nevertheless, several rail accessibility studies consider only static variables, such as distance, average speed and travel time, neglecting the temporal components of the considered variables. These limitations are often due to the lack of detailed data. In order to overcome the mentioned weaknesses, this paper presents a comprehensive methodology aimed to evaluate passenger rail accessibility using open data from both time-based GTFS <b>sources</b> and <b>Eurostat</b> geographical layers. Based on passenger train timetable, a set of accessibility indicators are built for allowing a comprehensive analysis of railway connections. The analysis is performed taking into account the Eurostat Local Administrative Units (LAU level 2, municipalities or equivalent units) and the main urban centers definition based on the concept of Greater City established by EC DG REGIO and OECD. The developed methodology is then applied to three European countries (Netherlands, Great Britain and France) where GTFS data are currently available. JRC.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the {{residential}} electricity price in most EU Member States has been increasing. Even after the introduction of significant reforms such as the liberalisation of the electricity market. This upward trend {{is in response to}} the development of different price components along the electricity supply chain. In order to identify and analyse these components for EU-Member States, a more detailed price apportionment than those offered by public <b>sources</b> like <b>Eurostat</b> and IEA is necessary. The methodology proposed in this study analyses the development of the residential electricity price and its main components between 2002 and 2012 for Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. The main drivers of the price trends observed for these four countries are subsequently identified, quantified and compared. Furthermore, the residential expenditure on electricity in each country is examined in connection with the evolution of residential electricity consumption. The results show how and to what extent the residential electricity price for the selected EU Member States depends on price components such as the electricity wholesale price, the gross margin, network expenditures, energy taxes and other levies related to the decarbonisation of the national energy system. Furthermore, this detailed analysis of residential electricity prices throughout {{the last decade}} provides a sufficient data basis to draw some prospective conclusions in terms of a short-term price outlook...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the structure}} of air traffic and its distribution among the different countries in the European Union, as well as traffic with an origin or destination in non-EU countries. Data <b>sources</b> are <b>Eurostat</b> statistics and actual flight information from EUROCONTROL. Relevant variables such {{as the number of}} flights, passengers or cargo tonnes and production indicators (RPKs) are used together with fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions data. The segmentation of air traffic in terms of distance permits an assessment of air transport competition with surface transport modes. The results show a clear concentration of traffic in the five larger countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK), in terms of RPKs. In terms of distance the segment between 500 and 1000 km in the EU, has more flights, passengers, RTKs and CO 2 emissions than larger distances. On the environmental side, the distribution of CO 2 emissions within the EU Member States is presented, together with fuel efficiency parameters. In general, a direct relationship between RPKs and CO 2 emissions is observed for all countries and all distance bands. Consideration is given to the uptake of alternative fuels. Segmenting CO 2 emissions per distance band and aircraft type reveals which flights contribute the most the overall EU CO 2 emissions. Finally, projections for future CO 2 emissions are estimated, according to three different air traffic growth and biofuel introduction scenarios...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCyclists, while {{relatively}} small in proportion {{with respect to}} motorized vehicles, have {{a high level of}} vulnerability, creating a significant need to better understand the characteristics specific to this user group. A good insight into the problem provides an opportunity to improve the road safety of this cheap, convenient and environmentally friendly mode of transport. In 2013, more than 2. 000 cyclists were killed in road traffic accidents in 27 EU countries, constituting almost 8 % of all road accident fatalities for that year. Although a considerable decrease by 32 % in the total number of bicycle fatalities in noted within the decade 2004 – 2013, it is still smaller than the respective reduction of the overall road fatalities by 45 %. The objective of this research is the analysis of basic road safety parameters related to cyclists in European countries, by the use of the EU CARE database with disaggregate data on road accidents, as well as of other international data <b>sources</b> (OECD/IRTAD, <b>Eurostat,</b> etc.). Time-series data on road accidents involving cyclists from 27 EU countries over a period of 10 years (2004 – 2013) are correlated with basic safety parameters, such as road type, season of the year, age and gender. Data from the EU Injury Database are used to identify injury patterns and improve the assessment of injury severity, and additional insight into accident causation for cyclists is offered through the use of in-depth accident data from the EC SafetyNet project Accident Causation System.

The results indicate that Finland has joined the top league of countries in many sectors of manufacturing. There have also occurred favourable developments in many sectors of private services relative to other countries. On the other hand, Finland has thus by now lost most of its earlier source of productivity growth, i. e. its position as a catching-up country. Consequently, it will be more difficult to raise productivity faster than other industrialised countries in the future. Meanwhile, our separate analysis of available data sources indicates that cross-country comparisons of productivity involve a lot of uncertainties, especially when using data at very disaggregated sectoral levels. productivity, measurement of productivity...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a scenario-based study carried out at the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre aimed at analyzing the future growth of aviation, the resulting fuel demand and the deployment of biofuels in the aviation sector in Europe. Three scenarios have been produced based on different input assumptions and leading to different underlying patterns of growth and resulting volumes of traffic. Data for aviation growth and hence fuel demand have been projected on a year by year basis up to 2030, using 2010 as the baseline. Data <b>sources</b> are <b>Eurostat</b> statistics and actual flight information from EUROCONTROL. Relevant variables such as the number of flights, the type of aircrafts, passengers or cargo tonnes and production indicators (RPKs) are used together with fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions data. The target of the European Advanced Biofuels Flightpath to ensure the commercialization and consumption of 2 million tons of sustainably produced paraffinic biofuels in the aviation sector by 2020, has also been taken into account. Results regarding CO 2 emission projections to 2030, reveal a steady annual increase in the order of 3 %, 1 % and 4 % on average, for the three different scenarios, providing also a good correlation compared to the annual traffic growth rates that are indicated in the three corresponding scenarios. In absolute values, these ratios correspond to the central, the pessimistic and the optimistic scenarios respectively, corresponding to 360 million tonnes CO 2 emissions in 2030, ranging from 271 to 401 million tonnes for the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios, respectively. This article also reports on the supply potential of aviation biofuels (clustered in HEFA/HVOs and biojet) based on the production capacity of facilities around the world and provides an insight on the current and future trends in aviation based on the European and national policies, innovations and state-of-the art technologies that will influence the future of sustainable fuels in aviation.
