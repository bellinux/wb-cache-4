5000|$|Rosary, {{a set of}} prayers {{which are}} {{typically}} said {{with the aid of}} prayer beads. A <b>saying</b> <b>of</b> the rosary consists (in total) of 53 recitations of the Hail Mary, six recitations of the Our Father, six instances of the Glory Be to the Father, one <b>saying</b> <b>of</b> the Apostles' Creed, and one <b>saying</b> <b>of</b> the Hail Holy Queen. Additionally, each <b>saying</b> <b>of</b> the rosary involved a private meditation upon one of the Mysteries. The Plan of Life calls for members of Opus Dei to say the rosary once each day.|$|R

25|$|Tolkien <b>says</b> <b>of</b> the Valar (including the Maiar) {{that they}} can change their shape at will, and move unclad in the raiment of the world, meaning {{invisible}} and without form. But it seems that Morgoth, Sauron, and their associated Maiar could lose this ability: Morgoth, for example, was unable to heal his burns from the Silmarils or wounds from Fingolfin and Thorondor; and Sauron lost his ability to assume a fair-seeming form after his physical body was destroyed in the downfall of Númenor.|$|E
25|$|Some {{priests in}} some parishes (six out of 80) bless {{permanent}} faithful relationships.

Ingham <b>says</b> <b>of</b> the practice: I insist only that those on all sides of the issue respect one another and that everyone should maintain the order of the church. Our goal in the Anglican Church in the Greater Vancouver area is to be a church that accommodates differences.|$|E
25|$|Heinz Hopf, who {{had been}} in Berlin before his {{appointment}} to Zurich at the ETH Privatdozent, held - as is clear from oral statements and also from letters - Issai Schur as a mathematician and greatly appreciated man. Here, this appreciation was based entirely on reciprocity: in a letter of 1930 to George Pólya {{on the occasion of the}} re-appointment of Hermann Weyl, Schur <b>says</b> <b>of</b> Hopf: Hopf is a very excellent teacher, a mathematician of strong temperament and strong effect, a master's discipline, trained excellent in other areas. - If I have to characterize him as a man, it may suffice if I say that I sincerely look forward to each time I meet with him.|$|E

25|$|Their {{influence}} certainly existed but it {{is difficult}} to define in its totality. Writers who followed them doubtlessly thought about them while they were creating their dark and tormented worlds such as Thomas Hardy in Jude the Obscure or Tess of the d'Urbervilles, or George Eliot with Adam Bede and The Mill on the Floss. There were also more conventional authors such as Matthew Arnold, who in a letter from 1853, <b>says</b> <b>of</b> Charlotte, that she only pretends to heartless: ' nothing but hunger, rebellion and rage'. In contrast, Mrs Humphry Ward, author of Robert Elsmere and morality novels, only finds didactic among the works of Charlotte, while she appreciates the happy blend of romance and realism in the works of Emily. There is however nothing that could constitute a literary vein.|$|E
25|$|Ashur-dugul, inscribed maš-šur-du-gul, “Look to (the god) Ashur!”, (c. 1665 BC – c. 1659 BC), apparently, “son of a nobody”, {{seized the}} throne {{from the three}} unpopular Amorite vassals. The Assyrian King List <b>says</b> <b>of</b> Ashur-dugul {{that he was a}} “son of a nobody, without right to the throne” meaning that he was not of royal descent and {{consequently}} unqualified to govern according to the patrilineal principle of legitimacy relied upon by later monarchs. During Ashur-dugul's reign six other kings, “sons of nobodies also ruled at the time”. This may suggest a fragmentation in the small Assyrian kingdom, with rival claims to the throne. Ashur-dugul was unable to retain control for long, and was soon deposed by a rival claimant, Ashur-apla-idi.|$|E
25|$|On July 8, 2017, Reinhart {{was arrested}} for battery after {{allegedly}} punching a bouncer. Reinhart's lawyer, Dina LaPolt, <b>says</b> <b>of</b> the incident that Reinhart was assaulted by bouncers at Lamplighter Inn in Palatine, Illinois without provocation and forcefully removed from the establishment while a friend in her party was violently beaten, sustaining multiple injuries. LaPolt expressed plans to take legal action against the bouncers involved in the incident. An active investigation into the event is underway, with police confirming on July 12, 2017, that a person was injured during the altercation, without revealing {{the identities of the}} injured person or their attacker. Reinhart appeared in court on August 2, 2017, and plead not guilty to a charge of misdemeanor battery. Her next court date is scheduled for October 6, 2017, at which time the case may go to trial. During the hearing, Reinhart's lawyer, Carmine Trombetta, described Reinhart as a victim, not a perpetrator in this case, and stated he is working on obtaining security footage to corroborate witness statements he already obtained in regards to the incident.|$|E

25|$|Melba made {{numerous}} gramophone (phonograph) {{records of}} her voice in England and America between 1904 (when she was already in her 40s) and 1926 for the Gramophone & Typewriter Company and the Victor Talking Machine Company. Most of these recordings, consisting of operatic arias, duets and ensemble pieces and songs, have been re-released on CD. The poor audio fidelity of the Melba recordings reflects {{the limitations of the}} early days of commercial sound recording. Melba's acoustical recordings (especially those made after her initial 1904 session) fail to capture vital overtones to the voice, leaving it without the body and warmth it possessed– albeit to a limited degree– in life. Despite this, they still reveal Melba to have had an almost seamlessly pure lyric soprano voice with effortless coloratura, a smooth legato and accurate intonation. Melba had perfect pitch; the critic Michael Aspinall <b>says</b> <b>of</b> her complete London recordings issued on LP, that there are only two lapses from pitch in the entire set. Like Patti, and unlike the more vibrant-voiced Tetrazzini, Melba's exceptional purity of tone {{was probably one of the}} principal reasons why British audiences, with their strong choral and sacred music traditions, idolised her.|$|E
