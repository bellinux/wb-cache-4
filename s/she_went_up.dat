25|$|In 1878, Lookout was wrecked in the Japan Sea. She was {{en route}} to Puget Sound from Shanghai, and was {{partially}} dismasted in a typhoon on September 12. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> on a reef near the island of Kutsonoshima. Three crewmen drowned attempting to land the ship’s boats; the rest managed to land {{with the help of}} local fishermen.|$|E
25|$|The {{bottom half}} quarter-final line-up was {{scheduled}} to play today, with only two women's singles matches taking the court. The first pitted seven-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams against Shahar Pe'er of Israel. The unseeded Williams lost the first set 6–3 but grew in confidence in the second set to take it 6–2 and push it to a deciding set. Pe'er looked on-form for victory when <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> 6–5 in the final set, {{and just a few}} points from her first major semi-final, but it was Williams who then showed her fighting spirit by winning the next three games to wrap up the 3–6, 6–2, 8–6 victory and become one of the ten lowest-ranked women in the Open Era to compete in a Grand Slam semi-final.|$|E
500|$|Later that day, Solanas {{arrived at}} the Factory and waited outside. Morrissey arrived and {{asked her what she}} was doing there, and she replied [...] "I'm waiting for Andy to get money". Morrissey tried to get rid of her by telling her that Warhol was not coming in that day, but she told him she would wait. At 2:00pm <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> into the studio. Morrissey told her again that Warhol was not coming in and that she had to leave. She left but rode the {{elevator}} up and down until Warhol finally boarded it.|$|E

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2007, Lady Gaga's {{management}} company introduced her to songwriter and producer RedOne, whom they also managed. By 2008, Gaga relocated to Los Angeles {{in order to work}} extensively with her record label to complete her debut album, The Fame, and set up her own creative team called the Haus of Gaga. [...] "LoveGame" [...] was one of the songs written by Gaga and RedOne who also produced the track. With Rolling Stone, Gaga explained that she was at a nightclub and had a [...] "sexual crush" [...] on somebody. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> to the person and uttered the line, [...] "I wanna ride on your disco stick". Thinking it to be a thoughtful metaphor for penis, Gaga went to the recording studio the next day and wrote the song in roughly four minutes. Gaga also had ideas for the live performance of the song where she used [...] "an actual stick—it looks like a giant rock-candy pleasuring tool—that lights up".|$|E
2500|$|This {{includes}} hearsay {{of multiple}} degree (that is, hearsay evidence of hearsay evidence: for example [...] "Jack {{told me that}} Jill told him that <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> the hill").|$|E
2500|$|<b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> {{one story}} {{and stopped in}} between floors. The gentleman started to yell, [...] "What's wrong!" [...] I said, [...] "The {{elevator}} operator wants to kiss you." [...] Shocked, the gentleman said, [...] "But I'm a married man!" [...] The girl said, [...] "I don't mind that." [...] She walked toward him, and he stepped back and said, [...] "You start the elevator." [...] So she started it. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> to about the fourth floor and stopped it again between floors. She said, [...] "I just have a craving for a kiss." [...] He said, [...] "You go about your business." [...] He wanted that elevator moving, not standing still. She replied, [...] "Well, let's go down {{and start all over}} again," [...] and she began to take the elevator down. He said, [...] "Not down, up!" [...] since he didn't want to go through that all over again.|$|E
50|$|Passionate by {{the comedy}} {{since she was}} small (<b>she</b> <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> on stage {{when she was just}} 10 years), she cut her teeth in the theater at 17 years old.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am. <b>She's</b> <b>gone</b> <b>up</b> {{herself to}} tell madam, and take she to Pearson's, and her said you'd better go there, back ways, or else {{stay here with}} governess till 'twas quieted down." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{drew her}} hand away to find her {{handkerchief}} and wipe her tears. [...] "I suppose you've come to see Suzette; but <b>she's</b> <b>gone</b> <b>up</b> to the village to talk with Mr. Putney; he's our lawyer." ...|$|R
2500|$|Captain West {{could not}} obtain a {{passenger}} license for the ship without having her re-caulked, so {{the small number}} of passengers were signed as crew members. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> to Nome carrying expedition equipment and general cargo and from about June 3–10 was occupied with the rescue and salvage of the barkentine Catherine Sudden, which had suffered a punctured hull and two broken masts hitting ice. A little later she set out on a prospecting expedition to Cape Chaplino and stopped at St Lawrence Island about June 17. [...] There she encountered the Russian steamer Progress, chartered by American mining engineer Washington Vanderlip and his Russian backers. [...] Vanderlip hired the Corwin to clear a channel through the ice so Progress could reach Cape Chaplino and the clear water just off the Siberian coast.|$|E
2500|$|Murdoch {{was educated}} in {{progressive}} independent schools, entering the Froebel Demonstration School in 1925 and attending Badminton School in Bristol as a boarder from 1932 to 1938. In 1938 <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> to Somerville College, Oxford, {{with the intention}} of studying English, but switched to Classics. At Oxford she studied philosophy with Donald M.

2500|$|Deryn (Dylan) Sharp: [...] Despite {{her father}} having {{been killed in}} a {{ballooning}} accident, Deryn longs to be in the sky and free, as her mother and aunts try to dress her up and force to her be a proper lady. [...] Deryn spends the remainder of her inheritance to come to London and live with her brother, where she studies to take the Midshipman exams to get into the British Air Service like her brother, but the toughest part is acting the role of boy, which she'll have to pull off in order to be accepted. It is her lucky day when her airman test goes awry and she is scooped up by the Leviathan and finishes her tests up there in order to serve aboard as a Midshipman. [...] She is able to best many of the Middies at learning the ropes because <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> so frequently with her father and because she pays attention during class. [...] She does her best to hide that she is a girl from everyone on board, though the observant eye of Dr. Barlow has noticed the lack of a beard on her chin. Luckily, Barlow has attributed it to Deryn lying about her age rather than being a girl. [...] As she gets to know Alek, she realizes that she owes him her life and, after he hugs her, that she may even have feelings for him, though she quickly tries to squelch that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Get {{back into}} the kitchen," [...] he said, [...] "before she comes out again. I shall keep in the garden. When <b>she</b> <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> into her room for the night, show {{yourself}} at the back-door--and I shall know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll try, but <b>she</b> <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> {{to read to}} Uncle, you know, {{and since}} he has had the gout, she stays later, so I see little {{of her in the}} evening. There <b>she</b> <b>goes</b> now. I think she will captivate the old one as well as the young one, she is so devoted." ...|$|R
6000|$|JULIA. Thanks: I {{shall be}} very pleased. (<b>She</b> <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> with {{affected}} purposelessness towards the recess.

6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> to JOHNNY {{and touches}} his forehead. He comes to himself [...] and hurries to the door, but {{suddenly}} MRS MARCH utters a little [...] feathery laugh.

60|$|Ralph looked his thanks, and softly, but quickly, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> the stairs. At {{a little}} landing she stopped.|$|E
