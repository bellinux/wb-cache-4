40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{experimental}} and theoretical {{investigation of the}} photorefractive properties of barium titanate and tungsten bronze ferroelectrics, and applications thereof. In the first part, the physics of the photorefractive effect is presented. The band transport equations are solved for three cases that describe the photorefractive mechanism in a crystal with one photorefractive species and either one or two types of charge carriers, or in a crystal with two photorefractive species, but only one type of charge carrier. In the second part, the coupled wave theory of two-wave mixing in photorefractive crystals is reviewed. Effects of energy coupling between the two interacting beams are discussed along with experimental methods for determining the two-beam coupling coefficient and the photorefractive response time. The photorefractive crystals barium titanate, <b>strontium</b> <b>barium</b> <b>niobate,</b> and barium strontium potassium sodium niobate are described in the third part. A summary of their optical, physical and electrical properties is presented for use in subsequent sections of the thesis. In the fourth part, the photorefractive properties of these crystals are presented. Data from two-beam coupling experiments are used to obtain the two-beam coupling coefficients and the photorefractive response times of the crystals {{under a variety of}} experimental conditions. The band transport models are then applied to these results. Figures of merit are defined in the fifth part that are then used in a comparison of several photorefractive materials, including the barium titanate, the <b>strontium</b> <b>barium</b> <b>niobate,</b> and the barium strontium potassium sodium niobate crystals. Both ferroelectric and non-ferroelectric materials are considered. In the last part, applications using barium titanate and the tungsten bronze ferroelectrics are described.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of investigations into the thermal and optical control of ferroelectric domains within lithium tantalate and <b>strontium</b> <b>barium</b> <b>niobate</b> crystals. The aim of the work was to develop techniques for optically pattering domain inverted structures within ferroelectric crystals. Initial studies involving <b>strontium</b> <b>barium</b> <b>niobate</b> revealed an enhanced temperature sensitivity for transient repoling occurring at room temperatures for this material. This has important consequences for the optical manipulation of domains in this material. Further work indicated that the optical control of domains in this material were limited by the variation in crystal properties of <b>strontium</b> <b>barium</b> <b>niobate</b> crystals. Subsequent work concentrated on lithium tantalate, in which domain pattering was successfully accomplished at room temperature via the simultaneous application of optical and electric fields. The technique consisted of illuminating the x-face of a 200 µm thick lithium tantalate z-cut crystal which had been polished to form a biprism. The resulting interferometric pattern, formed between planar electrodes applied to the +z and -z crystal faces, had a period of ~ 6 µm. This optical pattern defined where poling occurred by effectively increasing the coercive field within the illuminated regions of the crystal. This effect was used to inhibit ferroelectric switching within the illuminated regions so that the optical pattern is thereby translated into a corresponding domain structure. The increase in coercive field is a consequence of internal field relaxation within the crystal, for which the underlying principles of light induced ferroelectric switching are addressed. This is the first demonstration of optical periodic domain pattering using interferometric techniques...|$|E

These components are associated mainly with the static ferroelectric nanodomain structure and the dynamic order-parameter (polarization) fluctuations. Moreover, high-resolution neutron backscattering experiments allowed us to resolve characteristic frequencies of the order-parameter fluctuations and prove that this component is caused by the same polar fluctuations that are responsible for the Vogel-Fulcher dielectric relaxation, the hallmark of relaxor ferroelectrics.
