40|$|Thirteen {{drugs have}} been tested for their {{choleretic}} activity, biliary excretion of PSP and sulfuthiazole acetrlation ability of the liver. <b>Sodium</b> <b>dehydrocholate</b> (DHC) and reduced <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydrocholate</b> (R-DHC) had a preminent choloretic action, while they had no ability to increase the biliary excretion of PSP and acetylation ability of the liver. Adenine hydrochloride (AND), sodium adenosine triphosphate (ATP), sodium α-(1 -hydroxy-cyclohexy 1) -butylate (OHBA), para-hydroxy-phenylsalicilamide (PHPS), orotic acid (OTA) and magnecium and potassium aspartate (ASP) had an ability to increase biliary excretion, but the degree of the increasing rate of the liver functions was variable. Sodium ursodesoxycholate (U-DHC), sodium taurodesoxycholate (T-DHC) and 4 -amino- 5 -imidazole caeboxamide (AICA) decreased the sulfathiazole acetylation ability of the liver as well as biliary excretion of PSP. Sodium tioctate (TA) and thiamine- 8 -(methyl- 6 -dihydrothioctate) -disulfide hydrochloride (TATD) increased the biliary excretion of PSP and decreased the sulfathiazole acetylation of the liver and the bile excretion...|$|E
40|$|The biliary {{excretion}} rates of bile acid, lecithin, and cholesterol were measured in unanesthetized dogs after interruption of enterohepatic circulation and during infusions of sodium taurocholate, sodium glycocholate, <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydrocholate,</b> SC 2644 (a bicyclic organic acid with high choleretic potency), and secretin. Both lecithin output and cholesterol output were {{directly related to}} bile acid excretion rate. The curves describing these relationships were concave downward. Molar concentration ratios of lecithin-to-bile acid declined gradually from approximately 0. 4 to 0. 2 as bile acid output increased from approximately 1 to 70 μmoles/min. Cholesterol-to-lecithin molar ratios were highest (0. 05 - 0. 15) at very low rates of bile acid excretion, but descended rapidly to a plateau (0. 03 - 0. 04) which was constant over {{the entire range of}} bile acid excretion rates from 10 to 70 μmoles/min...|$|E
40|$|A study {{aimed at}} the {{characterization}} of five compounds with different chemical characteristics and gustative perceptions by measuring the variations of the electrical impedance of a composite sensor array is presented. The array was composed of five sensors of three different types based on carbon nanotubes or carbon black dispersed in polymeric matrices and doped polythiophenes. Measurements were carried out by evaluating the electrical impedance of the sensor array at a frequency of 150 Hz, and the data acquisition process was automated; a mechanical arm and a rotating platform controlled by a data acquisition card and a dedicated software allowed the sequential dipping of sensors in the test solutions. Fifty different solutions eliciting the 5 basic tastes (sodium chloride, citric acid, glucose, glutamic acid and <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydrocholate</b> for salty, sour, sweet, umami and bitter, respectively) at 10 concentration levels comprising the human perceptive range were analysed.

40|$|The flow of bile {{from the}} liver {{is known to}} be {{increased}} by a variety of sub-stances. Agents which stimulate the output of a bile characterized by increased water content and low specific gravity, viscosity and total solids, have been defined as hydrocholeretics (Ivy, 1944). The specific mechanisms involved in hydrocholeresis have not been elucidated. Increases in hepatic arterial blood flow have been observed following intravenous injections of <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydrocholate,</b> ketocholanic acids and cinchophen (Grodins, 1941). However, studies in the isolated rat liver (Brauer and Pessotti, 1952) in which potential regulatory fac-tors can be controlled, demonstrated hydrocholeresis in the presence of constant portal blood flow. Experiments in dogs (Wirts and Cantarow, 1942; Cantarow et al., 1948) indicated that dehydrocholate delayed the biliary excretion of bromsulfalein (BSP). A similar situation was found in the human (Mendeloff et aL, 1949). In the latter report, measurements of BSP concentration in peripheral blood suggested that dehydrocholate blocked the liver uptake of BSP. In an earlier report (Cook et al., 1952) evidence was presented that two prin...|$|E
40|$|Dehydrocholic {{acid and}} deoxycholic acid have been {{isolated}} and made avail-able for many years. Their properties and actions have been extensively reported upon and reviewed. Dehydrocholic acid, or <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydrocholate,</b> {{has been described}} as the least toxic and most choleretic of the bile acids and salts (1). Deoxycholic acid {{has been described as}} the most effective bile acid in aiding absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the gastro-intestinal tract (2). Based upon the estimation of a few properties of hepatic bile, dehy-drocholic acid has been classified as a “hydrocholeretic ” drug, since it has been reported to augment the volume but not the daily output of solids in bile (3). Such has not been our experience in a study {{of a wide variety of}} properties of hepatic bile; we have found both dehydrocholic and deoxycholic acids to augment the output of hepatic bile of normal composition in chronic, unanesthetized, biliary fistula dogs. Sixteen dogs, of 10 to 20 kilos body weight, were prepared for the continuous collection of hepatic bile by the technique of Rous and McMaster (4). Th...|$|E
40|$|An impedentiometric {{electronic}} tongue {{based on}} {{the combination of a}} composite sensor array and chemometric techniques aimed at the discrimination of soluble compounds able to elicit different gustative perceptions is presented. A composite array consisting of chemo-sensitive layers based on carbon nanotubes or carbon black dispersed in polymeric matrices and doped polythiophenes was used. The electrical impedance of the sensor array was measured at a frequency of 150 Hz by means of an impedance meter. The experimental set-up was designed in order to allow the automatic selection of a test solution and dipping of the sensor array following a dedicated measurement protocol. Measurements were carried out on 15 different solutions eliciting 5 different tastes (sodium chloride, citric acid, glucose, glutamic acid and <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydrocholate</b> for salty, sour, sweet, umami and bitter, respectively) at 3 concentration levels comprising the human perceptive range. In order to avoid over-fitting, more than 100 repetitions for each sample were carried in a 4 -month period. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to detect and remove outliers. Classification was performed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). A fairly good degree of discrimination was obtained...|$|E
40|$|The {{intravenous}} administration of decolin sodium has been recommended {{under certain conditions}} in functional insufficiency of the liver to outline the bile ducts in cholecystography. This recommendation {{has been made in}} spite of the fact that knowl-edge of its action upon the intestine is meager. With the use of the fluoroscope Freude (1) observed increased peristalsis of the stomach following the administration of decolin sodium. D#{ 252 }ker’(2) reported increased peristalsis of the intestine with the use ” of <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydrocholate.</b> There seem to have been no experiments made to determine the action of decolin sodium upon the intact intestine of the non-anesthetized dog. We have, therefore, undertaken this work using dogs with Thiry-Vella loops. METHOD The dogs used in this research were the same as those employed in a number of earlier investigations. Two animals had Thiry-Vella loops of the ileum and four similar fistulae of the jejunum. The methods of operation and experimental, procedure were the same as those previously employed and require no further de-scription. The balloon method of recording general tonus and activity of the gut was employed. The pressure within the bal-loon was never more than 15 cm. of water and the balloons wer...|$|E
40|$|For {{many years}} the {{hemodynamics}} of thyrotoxi-cosis {{have been of}} interest to clinicians. Blood flow through the extremities {{was assumed to be}} increased in thyrotoxicosis because of the high rate of heat elimination when the hand was placed in a calorimeter (1). Several workers found an in-crease in cardiac output in thyrotoxic subjects using the oxygen content of arm vein blood in the Fick formula (2 - 4). Similar findings were obtained using the nitrous oxide (5) and acetyl-ene methods (6, 7). The velocity of circulation, as determined by the rate of transit of radioactive materials through the cardiovascular system is accelerated in thyrotoxicosis and becomes normal after effective treatment (8, 9). Circulation time measured by <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydrocholate</b> in patients with thyrotoxicosis is more rapid than normal (10). Blalock and Harrison using oxygen content of right ventricular blood in the Fick formula showed that in dogs thyroid feeding produced an increase in cardiac output while thyroidectomy produced a decrease in output (11). Experiments concerning the myocardium di-rectly have shown an increase in 02 uptake/gram of muscle. Direct measurement of 02 consump-tion in the Warburg apparatus demonstrated an increase in oxygen utilization by the thyroid stimu-lated myocardium as shown in the isolated beating iThis investigation {{was supported in part by}} grants to the Cardio-Pulmonary Research Laboratory of th...|$|E
40|$|A study {{aiming at}} the {{discrimination}} of basic tastes {{by measuring the}} variations of the electrical impedance of a sensor array is presented. In the last decade many kinds of partially selective sensors have been developed, both for gaseous and liquid compounds, to be used into arrays capable of generating characteristic fingerprints of complex samples. Relevant data are analysed by pattern recognition techniques, mimicking the functionality of the human sense of smell and taste. In the case of electronic tongues, three measurement techniques are mainly used for sample analysis, i. e. potentiometry, voltammetry and conductimetry. In this work, the electrical impedance of a sensor array was measured at a frequency of 150 Hz {{by means of an}} impedance meter. The measurement process was automated; a mechanical arm and a rotating platform controlled by a data acquisition card and a dedicated software allowed the sequential dipping of sensors in the test solutions. The array was composed of five sensors of three different types based on carbon nanotubes or carbon black dispersed in polymeric matrices and doped polythiophenes. Measurements were carried out on 15 different solutions representing the five basic tastes (sodium chloride, citric acid, glucose, glutamic acid and <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydrocholate</b> for salty, sour, sweet, umami and bitter respectively) at three concentration levels comprising the human perceptive range. More than one hundred measurements were carried out for each sample in a six month period to evaluate the system repeatability and robustness.

40|$|To {{measure the}} {{velocity}} of blood flow in infants and young children, a completely objective proce-dure is required. Most of the methods (as for example determining the time elapsed between the injection of a sweet substance (saccharin) or a bitter substance (<b>sodium</b> <b>dehydrocholate)</b> and the arrival on the tongue of its characteristic taste) used for adults need {{the cooperation of the}} subject. The respiratory stimulation caused by potas-sium cyanide, injected intravenously, was utilized as an objective method by Robb and Weiss (1). We have not tried to apply this method to infants because of the danger in adjusting small doses to small patients. The lethal dose is said to be only about ten times the stimulating dose. Further-more, the end point would be difficult to evaluate since the infant's respirations would almost cer-tainly be irregular and disturbed by crying and emotional excitement. A satisfactory method for infants calls for a test material which can be accurately and objectively measured in small amounts and which, in the doses, used, is completely harmless. Radioactive sodium appeared to satisfy these requirements. The principle of using a radioactive substance was developed by Blumgart and Weiss (2), who injected the active deposit of radon into the ante-cubital vein of one arm, detecting its arrival in the other arm by a properly shielded cloud chamber. The active deposit consists of radium B and its products in equilibrium. It decays with a half-life of 26 minutes. The dose which they used, usually about 5 millicuries, was so small as to present no immediate danger. However, the residue is ra-dium D, a radioactive isotope of lead, with the very long half-life of 22 years. Although the activity of radium D, resulting from the disinte-gration of 5 millicuries of active deposit is ver...|$|E
40|$|Glucose {{is absent}} from human bile and present in low {{concentrations}} in bile from the rat. To study {{the mechanisms of}} this blood-bile glucose concentration difference, infusions of glucose were administered i. v. to 300 - 400 g male Sprague-Dawley rats with ligated renal pedicles and to two postcholecystectomy patients with indwelling t-tubes. Glucose was assayed in plasma, bile, and rat liver by a hexokinase method specific for D-glucose. In man, glucose was detected in bile when plasma glucose increased above 350 mg/ 100 ml. In animals studies, low concentrations of bile glucose were observed at plasma levels between 100 and 300 mg/ 100 ml. However, when plasma concentrations increased between 400 and 900 mg/ 100 ml, glucose appeared more rapidly in bile, defining by extrapolation an apparent plasma glucose threshold of 280 mg/ 100 ml. Intraportal phlorizin, a competitive inhibitor of glucose transport, significantly increased bile glucose concentrations. Plasma-bile concentration differences were also observed in rats after i. v. [3 - 14 C]O-methyl glucose (3 -O-MG) but not after [3 H]mannitol. Hepatic glucose levels were never lower than plasma levels and liver-plasma 3 -O-MG ratios were 0. 92 +/- 0. 22 indicating that entry of glucose and 3 -O-MG into hepatocyte water was not limiting. Furthermore, when <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydrocholate</b> augmented canalicular secretion, biliary glucose excretion increased proportionally suggesting that glucose entry into bile was not impeded. When estimates of hepatic glucose secretion were compared with biliary glucose excretion, the latter increased progressively when estimated secretion rates exceeded 50 micrograms/min or when phlorizin was given. Finally, during bile stop-flow experiments, [3 - 14 C]O-MG and [14 C]glucose were selectively removed from bile compared with [3 H]mannitol. The findings suggest that glucose and 3 -O-MG are reabsorbed from bile after entry at the hepatocyte, accounting for their low bile-plasma ratio. The biliary glucose transport process may be described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics and is analogous to recently defined kinetics for renal tubular reabsorption of glucose. These studies provide evidence that certain products of bile secretion may undergo a "biliohepatic" circulation...|$|E
