5|$|The {{field of}} the stadium {{combines}} a number of elements {{for use in the}} jumping and throwing events. The long jump and triple jump areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board—typically a small <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> with a plasticine marker attached—which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The pole vault area is also a 40-metre running track and has an indentation in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto cushioned landing mats. The high jump is a stripped down version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it.|$|E
25|$|Both {{repetitions of}} the 4th version {{are no longer}} in their {{original}} state. In the Amsterdam version a <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> was added at the top—probably by van Gogh himself. The Tokyo version, however, was enlarged on all sides with strips of canvas, which were added at a later time—presumably by the first owner, Émile Schuffenecker. The series is perhaps van Gogh's best known and most widely reproduced. In the 2000s debate arose regarding the authenticity of one of the paintings, and {{it has been suggested that}} this version may have been the work of Émile Schuffenecker or of Paul Gauguin. Most experts, however, conclude that the work is genuine.|$|E
2500|$|Harpsichords vary in {{size and}} shape, but {{all have the same}} basic mechanism. The player {{depresses}} a key that rocks over a pivot in the middle of its length. The other end of the key lifts a jack (a long <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood)</b> that holds a small plectrum (a wedge-shaped piece of quill, often plastic in the 2010s), which plucks the string. [...] When the player releases the key, the far end returns to its rest position, and the jack falls back. The plectrum, mounted on a tongue that can swivel backwards away from the string, passes the string without plucking it again. [...] As the key reaches its rest position, a felt damper atop the jack stops the string's vibrations. These basic principles are explained in detail below.|$|E
50|$|The Glass House sits upon {{solid rock}} {{overlooking}} Kootenay Lake and is constructed of approximately 500,000 empty embalming fluid bottles, {{which would have}} otherwise been discarded as waste. Built with a single layer of bottles laid with the short neck towards the inside, <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> were wired between the necks and reinforced with cement. The <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> then support the inner walls formed of cedar boards.|$|R
50|$|Steam bending is a {{woodworking}} technique where <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> are steam heated using a steam box. The applied {{heat and}} moisture makes the wood pliable enough to easily bend around a former {{to create a}} specific shape. The moulding process is usually done by clamping the <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> to a positive form, with the <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> often reinforced on the outside with a metal band to prevent blowout. The method {{has been used in}} the manufacturing of a diverse range of products, some examples being wooden boat building where it is used in the shaping of hull's ribs and lap boards, the production of traditional wooden lacrosse sticks, musical instruments such as violins and in the manufacture of wooden furniture like the Windsor chair and much of Michael Thonet's work.|$|R
50|$|The term is also {{applied to}} <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> metal or plastic laid across the washing tables during gravity {{separation}} {{of gold in}} alluvial or placer mining.|$|R
2500|$|Nor is {{this form}} entirely {{new in the}} history of the plastic arts. The negroes of the Ivory Coast have made use of a very similar method of {{expression}} in their dance masks. These are constructed as follows: a completely flat plane forms the lower part of the face; to this is joined the high forehead, which is sometimes equally flat, sometimes bent slightly backward. While the nose is added as a simple <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> two cylinders protrude about eight centimeters to form the eyes, and one slightly shorter hexahedron forms the mouth. The frontal surfaces of the cylinder and hexahedron are painted, and the hair is represented by raffia. It is true that the form is still closed here; however, it is not the [...] "real" [...] form, but rather a tight formal scheme of plastic primeval force. Here, too, we find a scheme of forms and [...] "real details" [...] (the painted eyes, mouth and hair) as stimuli. The result in the mind of the spectator, the desired effect, is a human face." ...|$|E
60|$|A long <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> {{fell to his}} ax--long {{enough to}} require cutting in two. He turned it, and stooped over it. Something caught his eye--letters carved in the wood. He looked closer. The letters were very faintly and badly cut. He could only make out the first three of them; and even of those he was not quite certain. They looked like C L A--if they looked like anything. He threw down the <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> irritably.|$|E

For {{a few hundred}} yards they coursed along the bottom of a hollow; then turning to the right they entered the <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> and in a few minutes gained the edge of it. Here Dick dismounted.|$|E
60|$|I {{cut from}} a tree a score of long, blunt thorns, tough and black as whalebone, and drove them through a <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> in which I had burnt a row of holes to receive them, and made myself a comb, and combed out my long, tangled hair to improve my appearance.|$|E
60|$|There were {{a number}} of fallen trees near the house and the Quadling got his axe and chopped them into logs of equal length. He took his wife's clothesline to bind these logs {{together}}, so that they would form a raft, and Ojo found some <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> and nailed them along the tops of the logs, to render them more firm. The Scarecrow and Dorothy helped roll the logs together and carry the <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> but it took so long to make the raft that evening came just as it was finished, and with evening the Quadling's wife returned from her fishing.|$|R

60|$|Gaiters.--If {{the country}} {{be full of}} briars and thorns, the insteps suffer cruelly when riding through bushes. It is easy to make gaiters either with buttons or buckles.

60|$|WE {{made our}} best speed across the <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> that now divided {{us from the}} stockade, and at every step we took {{the voices of the}} buccaneers rang nearer.

60|$|But {{the deed}} had been {{witnessed}} by {{the relatives of}} the poor woman. Without sound or cry, fifty Red men leaped on their horses and swept {{with the speed of}} light along {{the other side of the}} bluff, which concealed them from the white men's sight. Thus they managed to head them, and when Jake and his gang came to the end of the <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> the Red men, armed with rifle and revolver, were in front of them.|$|E

60|$|I {{had covered}} quite a little distance, and I was pass-ing through a <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> which {{lay at the}} foot of one of the flat-topped hills, when I became {{conscious}} of the sensation of being watched. My life within Pellucidar has rather quickened my senses of sight, hearing, and smell, and, too, certain primitive intuitive or instinctive qualities that seem blunted in civilized man. But, though I was positive that eyes were upon me, I could see no sign of any living thing within the wood other than the many, gay-plumaged birds and little monkeys which filled the trees with life, color, and action.|$|E
60|$|No man {{in all the}} country-side {{could beat}} the stout farmer at a race either short or long, but he soon found that four legs {{are more than a}} match for two. The troopers soon gained on him, though he ran like a {{mountain}} hare. Having the advantage, however, of a start of about three hundred yards, he reached the bend in the road where it begins to descend towards the ford before his pursuers overtook him. But Andrew felt that the narrow <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> beside which he was racing could not afford him shelter and that the ford would avail him nothing. In his extremity he made up his mind to a desperate venture.|$|E

50|$|Purfling was {{originally}} made <b>of</b> laminated <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> often contrasting in color {{as a visual}} accent.

6000|$|He {{dropped the}} plank, and turned deadly pale in a moment. His eyes wandered furtively {{backward}} and forward between the <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> {{on the floor}} and the half-demolished berth. [...] "Oh, God! what has come to me now?" [...] he said to himself, in a whisper. He snatched up the ax, with a strange cry--something between rage and terror. He tried--fiercely, desperately tried--to go on with his work. No! strong as he was, he could not use the ax. His hands were helpless; they trembled incessantly. He went to the fire; he held his hands over it. They still trembled incessantly; they infected the rest of him. He shuddered all over. He knew fear. His own thoughts terrified him.|$|E
6000|$|Sir Lionel was livid with rage. Strange as it {{may appear}} to any {{reasoning}} mind, the man really believed he had a natural right to prevent people from crossing that <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> where his pheasants were sitting. His ancestors had assumed it from time immemorial, and by dint of never being questioned had come to regard the absurd usurpation as quite fair and proper. He placed himself straight across the narrow path, blocking it up with his short and stumpy figure. [...] "Now look here, young man," [...] he said, with all the insolence of his caste: [...] "if you try to go on, I'll stand here in your way; and if you dare to touch me, it's a common assault, and, by George, you'll have to answer at law for the consequences." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{corners of}} the cloth should be secured by simple hitches in the rope, and never by knots.
