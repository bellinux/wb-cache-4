60|$|My Lady's lips move, {{but they}} utter nothing. <b>She</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|CHARTERIS (recoiling). Who {{told you}} that? (<b>She</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> mysteriously, {{and he turns}} away from her moodily and adds) You had much better not have asked.|$|E
6000|$|MR. WILLINGS. 'Your son, Mrs. Dowey--he has {{got five}} days' leave.' <b>She</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> slightly, {{or perhaps it}} only trembles a little on its stem. 'Now, now, good news doesn't kill.' ...|$|E
60|$|Anderssen {{held out}} the chubby infant, but <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> violently, and {{brow and}} neck turned crimson.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{and denied}} the {{imputation}} with much disgust.|$|R
60|$|There is {{emotion in}} Sir John's tone. It is very rough {{on him to}} find his plan of going to Kafoonistan has been outdone by Mrs. Harding's going to Balla Walla. <b>She</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "We all ken what sailors are," [...] is {{her dark}} way of denouncing {{those who go}} down to the sea in ships, and then <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and purses up her mouth as if she could tell things about sailors that would make our hair rise.|$|E
6000|$|BURNEY, the maid, a {{girl with}} one of those flowery Botticellian [...] faces only met with in England, comes in through the curtained [...] door, which she leaves open, {{disclosing}} the glimpse of a white [...] wall. PAYNTER looks up at her; <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> with an [...] expression of concern.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{interrupting}} {{him with}} a quick little gesture.|$|R
60|$|Lady Conyers {{watched her}} {{daughter}} searchingly. Then <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{girl was}} silent a moment; then <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> lightly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} calling Ellen Wade, {{who is on the}} rock keeping the look-out, to know if there is any thing to be seen," [...] {{observed}} the eldest of the young men; [...] "and <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> for an answer. Ellen is sparing of her words for a woman; and might be taught manners at least, without spoiling her good looks." ...|$|E
6000|$|STEVE, soothingly, 'Come now, we won't go {{into that}} again. It was just a mistake; and {{now that it is}} all settled and done with, I'll tell you what we shall do. You will let me get you a cab--' <b>She</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> 'I promise not to listen to the address; and after you have had a good night you--you will see things differently.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! You {{know what}} Ma is, Esther," [...] she returned. [...] "It's {{impossible}} to say whether she knows it or not. She has been told it often enough; and when she IS told it, she only gives me a placid look, as if I was I don't know what--a steeple in the distance," [...] said Caddy with a sudden idea; [...] "and then <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and says 'Oh, Caddy, Caddy, what a tease you are!' and goes on with the Borrioboola letters." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{without looking}} at him, like an abashed child.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> and {{sheltered}} the drawing-book again {{under her}} shawl.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{smiling as}} though not ill-pleased at the compliment.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} seem to have much to do with it," [...] she said doubtfully, [...] "and yet, perhaps it does. You know my mother is not quite of the same opinion as my father, {{although}} she never says so to him; but, when we are alone together, sometimes <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and says she fears that trouble is coming, and it makes her very unhappy. One day I was in the garden, and they were talking loudly in the dining room--at least, he was talking loudly. Well, he said--But I don't know whether I ought to tell you, Charlie." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ashley, without noting her protest: [...] "I had {{forgotten}} that I had a corkscrew in my pocket-knife. Don't trouble yourself to ring for one." [...] He produces {{the knife and}} opens the bottle; then, as Miss Ramsey rises and stands aghast, he pours out a glass and offers it to her, with mock devotion. As <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and recoils: [...] "Oh! I thought you liked cocktails. They are very good after cigarettes--very reviving. But if you won't--" [...] He tosses off the cocktail and sets down the glass, smacking his lips. [...] "Tell your brother I commend his taste--in cocktails and"--puffing his cigarette--"tobacco. Poison for poison, let me offer you one of my cigarettes. They're milder than these." [...] He puts {{his hand to his}} breast pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "And a most {{remarkable}} recovery too," [...] Alban informed her. [...] "It {{is the first}} case on record of any person getting over such an injury as she has received. Doctor Allday looked grave when he heard of it. 'I begin {{to believe in the}} devil,' he said; 'nobody else could have saved Mrs. Rook.' Other people don't take that view. She has been celebrated in all the medical newspapers--and she has been admitted to come excellent almshouse, to live in comfortable idleness to a green old age. The best of it is that <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> when her wonderful recovery is mentioned. 'It seems such a pity,' she says; 'I was so fit for heaven.' Mr. Rook having got rid of his wife, is in excellent spirits. He is occupied in looking after an imbecile old gentleman; and, when he is asked if he likes the employment, he winks mysteriously and slaps his pocket. Now, Miss Ladd, I think it's my turn to hear some news. What have you got to tell me?" ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} her {{expression}} was almost hopeless. <b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's deep silence. <b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> very slowly.|$|R
60|$|The colour {{faded from}} her face again, and <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> sadly.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is one of}} my expiring efforts," [...] she declared, {{sinking into}} the chair by his side. [...] "You know whose party it is, of course? Old Lady Torrington's. Quite a boy and girl affair. Twenty-four of us had dinner in the worst corner of the room. I can hear the old lady {{ordering}} the dinner now. Charles with a long menu. <b>She</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and taps him on the wrist with her fan. 'Monsieur Charles, I am a poor woman. Give me what there is--a small, plain dinner--and charge me at your minimum.' The dinner was very small and very plain, the champagne was horribly sweet. My partner talked of a new drill, his last innings for the Household Brigade, and a wonderful round of golf he played last Sunday week. I was turned on to dance with a man who asked me to marry him, a year ago, and I could feel him vibrating with gratitude, as he looked at me, that I had refused. I suppose I am very haggard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (They {{slip through}} the French window, but not quickly enough to have escaped the notice of PAUL, {{returning}} from his midnight stroll. The VICOMTE stands for a moment {{looking up at the}} empty balcony. He laughs softly to himself, and, throwing his cigarette away, passes through the glass door into the house. All is now silent, save for the nightingales and the distant bells. The curtain comes down for a moment to indicate the passage of several hours. It rises again with the sun. LUCREZIA's window opens and she appears on the balcony. She stands a moment with one foot over the threshold of the long window in a listening pose. Then her eyes fall on the better half of a pair of pink pyjamas lying crumpled on the floor, like a body bereft of its soul; with her bare foot she turns it over. A little shudder plucks at her nerves, and <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> as though, by this symbolic act, to shake off something clinging and contaminating. Then she steps out into the full glory of the early sun, stretching out her arms to the radiance. She bows her face into her hands, crying out loud to herself.) LUCREZIA. Oh, why, why, why? (The last of these Why's is caught by the WAITER, who has crept forth in shirt-sleeves and list-slippers, duster in hand, to clean the tables. He looks up at her admiringly, passes his tongue over his lips. Then, with a sigh, turns to dust the tables.) ...|$|E
6000|$|VALENTINE. Thank you. (He {{brings the}} stool {{from the bench}} in the corner; places it between them; and sits down with a {{judicial}} air. They attend to him with extreme gravity. He addresses himself first to Dolly.) Now may I ask, to begin with, {{have you ever been}} in an English seaside resort before? (<b>She</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> slowly and solemnly. He turns to Phil, who shakes his head quickly and expressively.) I thought so. Well, Mr. Clandon, our acquaintance has been short; but it has been voluble; and I have gathered enough to convince me that you are neither of you capable of conceiving what life in an English seaside resort is. Believe me, it's not a question of manners and appearance. In those respects we enjoy a freedom unknown in Madeira. (Dolly shakes her head vehemently.) Oh, yes, I assure you. Lord de Cresci's sister bicycles in knickerbockers; and the rector's wife advocates dress reform and wears hygienic boots. (Dolly furtively looks at her own shoe: Valentine catches her in the act, and deftly adds) No, that's not the sort of boot I mean. (Dolly's shoe vanishes.) We don't bother much about dress and manners in England, because, as a nation we don't dress well and we've no manners. But - and now will you excuse my frankness? (They nod.) Thank you. Well, in a seaside resort there's one thing you must have before anybody can afford to be seen going about with you; and that's a father, alive or dead. (He looks at them alternately, with emphasis. They meet his gaze like martyrs.) Am I to infer that you have omitted that indispensable part of your social equipment? (They confirm him by melancholy nods.) Them I'm sorry to say that {{if you are going to}} stay here for any length of time, it will be impossible for me to accept your kind invitation to lunch. (He rises with an air of finality, and replaces the stool by the bench.) ...|$|E
60|$|The {{girl looked}} {{doubtful}} for a moment, and then <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|Again the blankness of non-comprehension. <b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{at him and}} smiled.|$|R
60|$|Amanda Trivett listened attentively, but, when I had finished, <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the video}} for [...] "Inevitable", Shakira is singing the song to an {{audience}} in a circular stage in November 1998. The video starts out with candlelights coming from the audience. As the song progresses, strobe lights shine on Shakira and her band as <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Toward {{the end of the}} video, bubbles and confetti fall from above, the song slows to almost an a cappella, and the video exits with Shakira holding her microphone over her head.|$|E
5000|$|Agent Cooper and Sheriff Truman (Michael Ontkean) are in Ronette Pulaski's {{hospital}} room, interrogating her; when shown {{a portrait}} of Leo Johnson, <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> while seeing {{a portrait of}} BOB causes her to convulse violently and knock over her I.V. Wondering whether to burn the real ledger or the fake one redacted by Josie, Ben Horne (Richard Beymer) and his brother Jerry end up not burning either, decicing to toast marshmallows instead. In the Double R Diner, Deputy Andy Brennan tries to tape a poster of BOB to the door. After Norma Jennings (Peggy Lee) scolds her for spitting her chewing gum on the counter, the Log Lady (Catherine E. Coulson) tells Major Briggs (Don S. Davis) that her log tells him to [...] "deliver the message", to which the Major replies that he understands.|$|E
50|$|Gertrud Sand (Carsten Knudsen) is {{a farmer}} {{who lives on}} a farm in Jutland, who farms with potatoes. She has a husband named Oluf who lives along with her. She is very loud, often talking {{non-stop}} about how nice everything would be if this and that etc. She spends the entire series asking for the big crate with Christmas stuff. She also spends most episodes talking about her wish for a foodprocessor, but is told that they can't afford it. When Oluf doesn't listen to what she says <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> while breaking the fourth wall. When Oluf talks in the telephone about his potato-selling, Gertrud is told that it was wrong number when she asks. When she accidentally gives The Book away to some scouts for charity, she is confronted by Benny Jensen who screams and yells at her. She has a sister (known simply as Sister) and a brother-in-law named Kaj. When her sister calls her on the telephone she can talk for hours. She likes to listen to the radio. For Christmas she receives a foodprocessor from Oluf.|$|E
60|$|Patsey {{had spoken}} very few words during the day. <b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{and smiled}} up at him. She was immensely interested.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> emphatically, {{and said}} {{something}} that I failed to catch.|$|R
