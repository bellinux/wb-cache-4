Reports of the atrocities in Nanking had reached the Japanese government and some within the Army General Staff blamed Matsui for mishandling the crisis and causing Japan international embarrassment. Some even wanted him court-martialed for negligence. Even so, the Japanese government was not planning on dismissing Matsui <b>solely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the Nanking Massacre. The Foreign Ministry was displeased by anti-Western statements Matsui had made after becoming CCAA commander, including his comment {{that he did not}} recognize the neutrality of foreign concessions in Shanghai, and the Army General Staff was concerned about Matsui's severe personality conflicts with his subordinate commanders, which were interfering with the chain of command. The Army Minister Hajime Sugiyama told General Shunroku Hata that the inability of Matsui and his subordinates to coordinate and cooperate with one another was the reason he was being removed.|$|E

40|$|Mixed demand {{systems have}} been {{virtually}} ignored in empirical work <b>solely</b> <b>because</b> derivation <b>of</b> these systems requires closed forms for both direct and indirect utility functions. This article proposes the alternative of using a conditional cost function to generate empirical mixed demand models.

Evidence of this concerning trend has been revealed as stories have begun to emerge in the Australian community, regarding the effects of WorkChoices on women, families and young people. These groups have experienced worsening pay and conditions <b>solely</b> <b>because</b> the <b>of</b> the WorkChoices legislation, thus setting Australian workers up for potential loss of income, lifestyle and an effective employment relationship...|$|R

Since 2005, more than 710 Baha'is have been arrested, and the number of Baha'is in prison has risen from fewer than five to a current figure of 136; roughly 600 more are engaged with the penal system: awaiting trial, for example, or awaiting sentencing. The incarcerated now include young mothers of nursing children (imprisoned with their infants). Since the summer of 2013, escalation of attacks has included both murder and attempted murder.

25|$|In the event, the {{industrial}} web theory {{failed to achieve}} its goals. Various targets were chosen and attacked serially, without evaluating the results {{in light of their}} interdependence. American bombing leaders maintained that precision attacks were being carried out, but in early 1944 poor weather over Europe prevented visual sighting, and bombs were dropped indiscriminately by inaccurate radar methods through cloud cover, resulting in general population destruction. By September 1944, all pretense to precision was abandoned when General Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered the area bombing of Berlin. By that time, bombing had become as much tactical as strategic, to soften Germany for invasion by ground troops. Thousand-bomber raids were not able to diminish industrial production of materiel in time to prevent invasion. When arms production in Germany finally faltered {{in the third quarter of}} 1944, only 30% of the total of eventual bomb tonnage had been dropped on the country—this after the French-German border had been reached and the war on the ground had seen its decisive breakthrough. Germany was conquered by invasion; it did not surrender <b>solely</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> bombing. The morale of the enemy was not significantly affected—no population that was bombed in World War II lost their will to resist, and it was the Emperor, not the people, who decided Japan must surrender.|$|E

30|$|It is {{important}} to note that we only consider technological measures, not behavioral changes: for example, we consider changing the type of vehicle, not a reduction of average speeds on roads, efficient driving or a change in mobility demand. We thus limit the analysis to such measures whose effects can be estimated reliably. Behavioral changes, although very interesting and potentially highly effective, are excluded <b>solely</b> <b>because</b> the costs <b>of</b> the various tools to achieve them are very difficult to estimate: Advertising and awareness programs, price incentives, prohibitions, etc. All these tools incur administrative costs and welfare reductions which are hard to measure (although one could calculate them by changes in consumer surplus in some cases). Another problem when integrating these measures would arise when defining the reaction of consumers to these programs and thus the reduction potential. Anyway, these behavioral changes could always be included ex-post.|$|R
40|$|When cassava is intercropped with legumes the {{cassava root}} yield {{generally}} decreases compared with when cassava is planted alone. This {{is due to}} the competition of the component crops for light, water and nutrients. However, cassava-legume intercropping systems usually increase the land use efficiency and economic return over <b>solely</b> cassava. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> the current low market price for cassava roots, dual-purpose production of cassava for both root and fodder should be developed. Cassava hay is a good fodder for dairy cows, and legume crops, such as cowpea and peanut whose residues also provide good fodder for livestock, can be intercropped with cassava. When cowpea was row and strip intercropped with cassava, it produced fodder yields of 1. 7 to 2. 4 tons/ha, depending on the cowpea cultivar. Cowpea seeds and young green pods are eaten by humans. A food-feed system based on cassava-cowpea strip intercropping has been successfully developed by dairy farmers in Mahasarakham province in Northeast Thailand. Peanuts and mungbean are also high-potential legume crops for food-feed systems for dairy farmers...|$|R
