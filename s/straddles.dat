5|$|The geology is {{dominated}} by rocks Carboniferous in age but, as the parish <b>straddles</b> a complex section of the North Craven Fault, it is varied. To the north-east of the village the rocks are predominantly Bowland sandstones and shales, and to the south-east are largely massive limestones. The River Wharfe runs across the limestone, through an impressive gorge at Loup Scar. The mineral veins of the Bowland series have been exploited for lead ore.|$|E
50|$|Action {{begins with}} the player {{to the left of}} the <b>straddle.</b> If action returns to the <b>straddle</b> without a raise, the <b>straddle</b> has the option to raise. (This is part of what makes a <b>straddle</b> {{different}} from a sleeper because a sleeper does not have the option to raise if everyone folds or calls around to him.) Some casinos permit the player to the left of a live <b>straddle</b> to re-straddle by placing a blind bet raising the original <b>straddle.</b> Most public cardrooms do not permit more than one re-straddle. Depending on house rules, each re-straddle is often required to be double the previous <b>straddle,</b> so as to limit the number of feasible re-straddles.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Straddle</b> - {{holding a}} {{position}} in both a call and put with the same strike price and expiration. If the options have been bought, the holder has a long <b>straddle.</b> If the options were sold, the holder has a short <b>straddle.</b> The long <b>straddle</b> is profitable if the underlying stock changes value in a significant way, either higher or lower. The short <b>straddle</b> is profitable {{when there is no}} such significant move; ...|$|R
5000|$|The player {{immediately}} {{to the left of}} the big blind ("under the gun", UTG) may place a live <b>straddle</b> blind bet. The <b>straddle</b> must be the size of a normal raise over the big blind. A <b>straddle</b> is a live bet; but does not become a [...] "bigger blind". The <b>straddle</b> acts as a minimum raise but with the difference being that the straddler still gets their option of acting when the action returns to them. In a No-Limit game if any other player wants to make a raise with a <b>straddle</b> on board, the minimum raise will be the difference between the big blind and the <b>straddle.</b>|$|R
5|$|There are, loosely speaking, {{three main}} wine {{producing}} regions {{with a major}} presence {{in the state of}} Oregon, as defined by non-overlapping American Viticultural Areas. Two of them—the Willamette Valley AVA and the Southern Oregon AVA—are wholly contained within Oregon; a third, the Columbia Gorge AVA <b>straddles</b> the Columbia River and includes territory in both Oregon and Washington; however, this AVA is considered to be an Oregon AVA. Portions of the Walla Walla Valley AVA, an area primarily in Washington (along with the Columbia Valley AVA, which contains it), descend into Oregon in the Milton-Freewater area. The Southern Oregon AVA was recently created as the union of two Southern Oregon winegrowing regions long considered distinct, the Rogue Valley and the Umpqua Valley. Several other smaller AVAs are found within some of these larger regions. The Snake River Valley AVA, which <b>straddles</b> Oregon's border with Idaho along the Snake River, is the first AVA to include a part of Eastern Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{was asked}} to write an essay for the layman {{describing}} what mathematics is, and produced a beautiful analysis. He explained that mathematics <b>straddles</b> the world between the empirical and logical, arguing that geometry was originally empirical, but Euclid constructed a logical, deductive theory. However, he argued, that {{there is always the}} danger of straying too far from the real world and becoming irrelevant sophistry.|$|E
5|$|Wagga Wagga is at {{the eastern}} end of the Riverina region where the slopes of the Great Dividing Range flatten and form the Riverina plain. The city <b>straddles</b> the Murrumbidgee River, one of the great rivers of the Murray-Darling Basin, and the city centre is on the {{southern}} bank, protected by a levee from potential flooding.|$|E
50|$|<b>Straddling</b> stock can be {{compared}} with transboundary stock. <b>Straddling</b> stock range both within an EEZ {{as well as in}} the high seas. Transboundary stock range in the EEZs of at least two countries. A stock can be both transboundary and <b>straddling.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mississippi straddle: Alice posts $1, Dianne posts $2, Ellen, on the button, posts a Mississippi <b>straddle</b> of $4. Because of the <b>straddle,</b> Alice, {{the small}} blind, is now first to act; she folds. Dianne calls the <b>straddle</b> by putting an {{additional}} $2 in the pot. Carol folds. Joane calls the <b>straddle.</b> Ellen has {{the option of}} checking or raising; she checks, ending betting on this round.|$|R
50|$|<b>Straddling</b> is {{considered}} poor long-term strategy by most experts, since {{the benefit of}} obtaining last action is more than offset by the cost of making a blind raise. Because <b>straddling</b> {{has a tendency to}} enrich the average pot size without a corresponding increase in the blinds (and antes if applicable), players who sit at tables that allow <b>straddling</b> can increase their profits considerably simply by choosing not to <b>straddle</b> themselves.|$|R
5|$|As {{knowledge}} has increased, paleontology has developed specialised subdivisions. Vertebrate paleontology concentrates on fossils of vertebrates, {{from the earliest}} fish to the immediate ancestors of modern mammals. Invertebrate paleontology deals with fossils of invertebrates such as molluscs, arthropods, annelid worms and echinoderms. Paleobotany focuses {{on the study of}} fossil plants, but traditionally includes the study of fossil algae and fungi. Palynology, the study of pollen and spores produced by land plants and protists, <b>straddles</b> the border between paleontology and botany, as it deals with both living and fossil organisms. Micropaleontology deals with all microscopic fossil organisms, regardless of the group to which they belong.|$|E
5|$|During the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Arizona was bombed. After a bomb detonated in a powder magazine, the {{battleship}} exploded violently and sank, {{with the loss}} of 1,177officers and crewmen. Unlike many of the other ships sunk or damaged that day, Arizona was irreparably damaged by the force of the magazine explosion, though the Navy removed parts of the ship for reuse. The wreck still lies at the bottom of Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona Memorial, dedicated on 30 May 1962 to all those who died during the attack, <b>straddles</b> the ship's hull.|$|E
5|$|In {{southeast}} Broken Arrow, the Creek Turnpike {{crosses the}} county line into Wagoner County and swings towards the north-northeast. It then meets SH-51, {{followed by the}} Muskogee Turnpike (SH-351) near that highway's western terminus. The Creek Turnpike passes through {{the third and final}} barrier toll after re-entering Tulsa. From the toll plaza, the turnpike proceeds north to end at the I-44/US-412 interchange, which <b>straddles</b> the Wagoner–Rogers County county line. The portion of the interchange that sits in Rogers County also lies in the town of Fair Oaks. The mainline Creek Turnpike becomes the Will Rogers Turnpike as eastbound I-44 merges onto the roadway.|$|E
5000|$|A short <b>straddle</b> is a {{non-directional}} options trading {{strategy that}} involves simultaneously selling a put and a {{call of the}} same underlying security, strike price and expiration date. The profit {{is limited to the}} premium received from the sale of put and call. The risk is virtually unlimited as large moves of the underlying security's price either up or down will cause losses proportional to the magnitude of the price move. A maximum profit upon expiration is achieved if the underlying security trades exactly at the strike price of the <b>straddle.</b> In that case both puts and calls comprising the <b>straddle</b> expire worthless allowing <b>straddle</b> owner to keep full credit received as their profit. This strategy is called [...] "nondirectional" [...] because the short <b>straddle</b> profits when the underlying security changes little in price before the expiration of the <b>straddle.</b> The short <b>straddle</b> can also be classified as a credit spread because the sale of the short <b>straddle</b> results in a credit of the premiums of the put and call.|$|R
50|$|Highly {{migratory species}} can be {{compared}} with <b>straddling</b> stock and transboundary stock. <b>Straddling</b> stock range both within an EEZ {{as well as in}} the high seas.

5|$|Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike (signed as Union Turnpike–Kew Gardens on {{overhead}} and entrance signs) is an express {{station on the}} IND Queens Boulevard Line of the New York City Subway. Located at Union Turnpike and Queens Boulevard {{on the border of}} Kew Gardens and Forest Hills, Queens, it is served by the E and F trains at all times. Despite the station's name, Union Turnpike forms the border between Kew Gardens and Forest Hills, and the station <b>straddles</b> that border, with multiple entrances located in each neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|NY286 {{begins at}} the ramp {{connecting}} NY590 southbound to Browncroft Boulevard just inside the Rochester city limits. It heads east through residential surroundings as a four-lane highway, proceeding through the remainder of NY590 exit7 as it enters the northernmost portion {{of the town of}} Brighton. East of NY590, NY286 widens to become a divided highway. It passes into Penfield upon crossing Irondequoit Creek and curves southeast as it <b>straddles</b> the northern boundary of Ellison Park. During this stretch, it intersects with Old Browncroft Boulevard, the pre-divided highway alignment of Browncroft Boulevard which is now discontinuous near its midpoint.|$|E
5|$|NY33A {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY33 {{just east of}} the village of Bergen in the town of the same name. From this point, NY33 travels to the west and to the northeast while NY33A heads east. Less {{than a quarter of a}} mile (0.4km) from its western terminus, NY33A meets Interstate490 (I-490) at exit2. In this area, I-490 <b>straddles</b> the border between Genesee County and Monroe County; thus, the westbound portion of the interchange is in Genesee County while the eastbound half is in Monroe County.|$|E
50|$|Straddle: Alice posts $1, Dianne posts $2, Carol posts a <b>straddle</b> of $4. The hole {{cards are}} dealt. Because of the <b>straddle,</b> Joane is now first to act; she folds. Ellen calls the <b>straddle.</b> Alice folds. Dianne, the big blind, calls the <b>straddle</b> by putting an {{additional}} $2 in the pot. Carol has {{the option of}} checking or raising; she makes a raise of $8. Ellen folds. Dianne calls the raise, ending betting on this round.|$|R
50|$|Matzdorf {{utilized}} the bent-leg <b>straddle</b> jumping style, {{a modification of}} the classic straight-leg <b>straddle</b> which dominated the sport in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the {{scissors}} or flop style of jump, where the jumper approaches the bar {{so as to}} take off from the outer foot, the <b>straddle</b> jumper approaches from the opposite side, so as to take off from the inner foot. In this respect the <b>straddle</b> resembles the western roll. However, in the western roll the jumper's side or back faces the bar; in the <b>straddle</b> the jumper crosses the bar face down, with legs <b>straddling</b> it. With this clearance position, the <b>straddle</b> has a mechanical advantage over the western roll, since {{it is possible to}} clear a bar that is higher relative to the jumper's center of mass. In simple terms, the western roll jumper has to raise the width of the body above the bar; the <b>straddle</b> jumper has only to get the thickness ofthe body above it.|$|R
5|$|New York State Route394 (NY394) is a {{state highway}} located within Cattaraugus and Chautauqua {{counties}} in southwestern New York in the United States. Its western terminus {{is located on the}} shore of Lake Erie at an intersection with NY5 in the Westfield hamlet of Barcelona. The eastern terminus is located at an interchange with the Southern Tier Expressway (Interstate86 or I-86 and NY17) at the Coldspring hamlet of Steamburg. From Mayville to Jamestown, NY394 follows the western edge of Chautauqua Lake. East of Jamestown, the route <b>straddles</b> the Southern Tier Expressway and connects to the highway in four different locations, including at its eastern terminus.|$|E
5|$|Scarborough is {{represented}} by five ridings for the Provincial government and five full ridings plus one partial riding for the Federal government. The Federal riding of Pickering—Scarborough East <b>straddles</b> the border between Scarborough and Pickering. Municipal riding boundaries were harmonized within the City of Toronto to match the provincial boundaries in 1999 through provincial legislation called The Fewer Municipal Politicians Act of 1999. This took effect on December 1, 2000. Each provincial riding is split between two city councillors. Thus Scarborough {{is represented}} by ten councillors.|$|E
5|$|The Pasadena–Baytown area, {{including}} Deer Park and La Porte, <b>straddles</b> the Houston Ship Channel and {{has since}} the world wars been defined by the heavy industry along its shores. The two towns have distinct histories with Baytown having become tied to the oil industry earlier and Pasadena having a longer history tied to ranching and agriculture before petrochemicals came to dominate. But in modern times their fortunes have been closely tied by their cores of heavy industry.|$|E

5|$|The South Mountain Freeway, {{presently}} under construction, is a southerly bypass of Downtown Phoenix {{which will}} {{run along the}} southern edge of the Ahwatukee neighborhood of Phoenix and pass just to the south and west of South Mountain Park. It begins at the already complete traffic interchange of the Santan Freeway and Interstate 10. Heading west along the Pecos Road alignment through Ahwatukee, the freeway <b>straddles</b> the border with the Gila River Indian Reservation. Turning northwest and eventually north, the freeway will follow the 59th and 55th Avenue alignments north to its terminus with Interstate 10 in west Phoenix.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} a total area of , making it the second-largest city in Slovakia by area (after the {{township}} of Vysoké Tatry). Bratislava <b>straddles</b> the Danube River, which it had developed around and for centuries was the chief transportation route to other areas. The river passes through the city from the west to the southeast. The Middle Danube basin begins at Devín Gate in western Bratislava. Other rivers are the Morava River, which forms the northwestern border {{of the city and}} enters the Danube at Devín, the Little Danube, and the Vydrica, which enters the Danube in the borough of Karlova Ves.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{north from}} Perry City, NY227 <b>straddles</b> the SchuylerTompkins county line, with the {{northbound}} lane in Tompkins County. After , NY227 turns northeastward, leaving {{the border and}} completely entering Tompkins County {{in the town of}} Ulysses. Here, directional signage along the route switches from east–west to north–south. The backdrop remains rural for another mile to an intersection with Mayo Road, where the land surrounding the highway begins to become more populated. NY227 continues its northeastern progression into the village of Trumansburg, initially passing the local golf course and intersecting with the eastern terminus of CR149 (Searsburg Road). The area around the road becomes primarily residential, a trend that follows the route to its northern end at a junction with NY96 (West Main Street) in downtown Trumansburg.|$|E
