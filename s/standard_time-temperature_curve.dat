Conventionally the fire rating of load bearing wall systems made of Light gauge Steel Frames (LSF) is determined using fire tests based on the <b>standard</b> <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curve</b> given in ISO 834 (ISO, 1999).

This paper presents the details of research undertaken to develop an energy based time equivalent approach to obtain the fire resistance ratings of LSF walls exposed to realistic design fire curves with respect to standard fire exposure. This approach relates to the amount of energy transferred to the member. The proposed method was used to predict the fire resistance ratings of single and double layer plasterboard lined and externally insulated LSF walls.

40|$|Fire {{safety of}} {{light gauge steel}} frame (LSF) stud walls is {{important}} in the design of buildings. Currently LSF walls are increasingly used in the building industry, and are usually made of cold-formed and thin-walled steel studs that are fire-protected by two layers of plasterboard on both sides. Many experimental and numerical studies have been undertaken to investigate the fire performance of load bearing LSF walls under standard fire conditions. However, the <b>standard</b> <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curve</b> does not represent the fire load present in typical residential and commercial buildings that include considerable amount of thermoplastic materials.

Therefore in this research, finite element thermal models of the traditional LSF wall panels without cavity insulation and the new LSF composite wall panels were developed to simulate their fire performance under recently developed realistic design fire curves. Suitable thermal properties were proposed for plasterboards and insulations based on laboratory tests and literature review. The developed models were then validated by comparing their thermal performance results with available results from realistic design fire tests, and were later used in parametric studies.

40|$|The New Zealand Building Code (NZBC) {{deemed to}} satisfy {{solution}} for houses and small multi-unit dwellings requires external walls within 1 m of and at angles less than 90 ° to a property boundary to be fire-rated {{to a minimum}} 30 -min fire resistance rating (FRR). The NZBC also requires structural building systems to remain stable during and after fire when subjected to a uniformly distributed horizontal face load of 0. 5 kPa ‘in any direction’. This research investigated the fire performance of laterally loaded light timber-framed compartments, to assess their suitability under the NZBC requirements for residential buildings. The research involved a full-scale standard furnace experiment and a full-scale compartment fire experiment. The building design was based on common New Zealand residential building construction for a light timber-frame building with compartment dimensions of 4. 33 m × 3. 35 m and stud height of 2. 4 m. One of the 4. 33 m walls was 30 -min fire-rated and the other building elements were of typical non-fire-rated construction. Internal wall and ceiling linings were 10 mm thick standard grade plasterboard, except for the fire-rated wall which had 10 mm fibre-reinforced plasterboard {{on both sides of}} the timber framing. The external cladding and roof consisted of light-weight sheet materials except for the fire-rated wall which had no additional covering. The fire-rated wall was subjected to a lateral load applied at the top plate equivalent to a 0. 5 kPa face load. The roof truss system was an integral component in providing lateral support to the fire-rated wall and each roof truss spanned between the fire-rated wall and the parallel 4. 33 m wall. Each roof truss was designed with a splice in the centre of the bottom chord, connected by toothed metal connector plates. In the furnace experiment the compartment was heated to the ISO 834 <b>standard</b> <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curve,</b> failure of the roof truss system at the truss connector plate was observed after 30. 5 min, causing failure of the roof resulting in lateral deflection of the loaded fire-rated wall. It was found there was non-uniform temperature distribution in the compartment. An analysis of the failure taking into consideration temperature distribution in the compartment suggests that the roof truss system with splice supporting the fire-rated wall would fail in lateral stability after 26 min if the furnace had been driven to achieve the ISO 834 time-temperature relationship at ceiling level. An analysis of expected performance of an unlined compartment predicts a lateral stability failure time of 19. 5 min if exposed to the ISO 834 <b>standard</b> <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curve.</b> The compartment experiment was a natural fire with a fixed initial ventilation and fuel load consisting of wood cribs. The roof truss design incorporated specific protection of the splice using blocks of timber. The wall system failed in lateral stability after 28 min and before all the fuel in the compartment was consumed. Applying a time equivalence method suggests that the fire-rated wall restraint system performance would be the equivalent of 33. 5 min in a standard fire resistance test for the compartment. Comparing the results for Experiments # 1 and # 2, the protection added to the splice improved the performance of the lateral load restraint system from 26 min to 33. 5 min.

This has caused problems for safe evacuation and rescue activities, and in some instances lead to the collapse of buildings (Lewis, 2008 and Nyman, 2002). Recent research has shown that the actual fire resistance of building elements exposed to building fires can be less than their specified fire resistance rating (Lennon and Moore, 2003, Jones, 2002, Nyman, 2002 and Abecassis-Empis et al. 2008). Conventionally the fire rating of building elements is determined using fire tests based on the <b>standard</b> fire <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curve</b> given in ISO 834. This ISO 834 curve was developed in the early 1900 s, where wood was the basic fuel source. In reality, modern buildings make use of thermoplastic materials, synthetic foams and fabrics.

40|$|Generally fire {{resistant}} structures {{are expected to}} survive a fire in a compartment. Some structures such as floors may be designed to provide time for occupants to escape from other compartments. A common misconception is that the fire resistance rating (FRR), the time an assembly will survive in a test furnace is the time available to escape. In small compartments {{such as those in}} residential accommodation the FRR is significantly longer than the time the assembly will survive in a real fire in the compartment. Some fire engineering designs for retrofitted accommodation buildings use FRR times for light timber frame walls and floors as the available egress time. The method of time equivalence can provide a prediction of the FRR required to survive a compartment burnout. The ratio of the total burning time of the fire to the time equivalent can be used to provide an estimate of the time taken for an assembly of given fire resistance to fail by multiplying the ratio by the FRR. This method is shown to be non-conservative when a computer model of light timber frame wall assemblies is run using both realistic <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curves</b> and the ISO- 834 <b>standard</b> fire test <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curve.</b> This method is more conservative than assuming that an assembly will last as long in a compartment fire as predicted by the FRR...|$|R

Traditionally, increased fire rating is provided by simply adding more plasterboards to light gauge steel frame (LSF) walls, which is inefficient.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{vulnerability}} to high temperatures, steel structures are typically protected against fire by insulation materials, {{as recommended by}} fire codes. The fire resistance rating of a protected member is determined based on a standard fire test, which simulates post-flashover fire conditions. Empirical evidence has shown that fires in large open-plan compartments do not burn uniformly, and a method called “traveling fire” has been introduced in previous research to simulate the effects of spreading fires. An investigation is performed here to examine the robustness of a generic four-story moment-resisting steel structure with one-hour fire resistance rating subjected to travelling fire. Various fire sizes are considered: 12. 5, 25, 50 and 100 % of the floor area. The results show that while no collapse occurs during the 12. 5, 50 and 100 % fire sizes, the structure collapses under the 25 % fire size at 85 min due to {{the inability of the}} system to transfer the load after one of the columns buckles. This seems to be in contradiction with traditional belief that a fire covering a larger portion of the floor plan would reduce the safety margin. The investigation performed underlines that the fire protection of structures based on the <b>standard</b> <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curve</b> does not necessarily provide adequate resistance under travelling fires.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the thermal and structural behaviour of reinforced concrete members in fire conditions. The numerical analyses of temperature histories and mechanical behaviour of reinforced concrete structural members subjected to fire are the major components of this research. In this thesis a non-linear finite element procedure is proposed to predict the temperature distribution history in the cross section of structural members, such as beams composed of reinforced concrete, in fire conditions. A theoretical analysis of heat and moisture transfer in concrete was made which incorporated the simplifications that energy transfer by convection and diffusion in concrete could be neglected. However, the effect of water evaporation in concrete was considered. The thermal properties of concrete were considered as temperature and moisture dependent and the thermal properties of steel as temperature dependent only. The fire conditions were described by <b>standard</b> <b>time-temperature</b> fire <b>curves</b> and convection and radiation boundary conditions were used. In order to validate the model a series of verification tests have been carried out through a quantitative comparison of the model predictions against known test results. Fairly good accuracy has been found. A non-linear finite element procedure for predicting the structural behaviour of the planar reinforced concrete members is also developed. The proposed procedure is based on "plane stress" theory and an iterative, secant stiffness formulation is employed. The complex features of structural behaviour in fire conditions, such as thermal expansion, shrinkage, creep, transient strains, cracking or crushing and change of material properties with temperature are considered in this model. Predictions from the model proposed are compared against experimental results, as well as against the model proposedb y previous researchers, and a better correlation to experimental data is found. It is shown that the secant stiffness approach can provide good numerical stability for the analysis of planar reinforced concrete members in fire conditions. The model proposed in this study has the potential to predict the fire resistance of a planar reinforced concrete members with an accuracy that is adequate for practical purposes if realistic material properties are available...|$|R

40|$|Road {{and rail}} tunnels are {{important}} parts of the modern infrastructure. High strength concrete (HSC) is commonly used for tunnels and other civil engineering structures, since it allows high load carrying capacity and long service life. In general, Swedish road and rail tunnels should be designed for a service life of 120 years. However, HSC has shown {{to be sensitive to}} severe fires in the moist tunnel environment, i. e., fire spalling may occur. Extensive research shows that addition of polypropylene (PP) fibres in the fresh concrete mix significantly reduces the risk of fire spalling. The durability of a concrete structure is mainly governed by the transport properties. Further, experimental studies aimed at understanding the protective mechanism of PP fibres indicate that fluid transport increases in connection with the melting temperature of such fibres. This might reduce the durability of fire exposed concrete with addition of PP fibres. This study aims to investigate whether the use of PP fibres has any significant effect on the durability of moderate fire exposed concrete structures. The experimental study focused on transport properties related to durability and stiffness reduction of fire exposed civil engineering concrete with and without addition of PP fibres. The study consists of three parts; (i) unilateral fire exposure in accordance with the <b>standard</b> <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curve</b> (Std) and a slow heating curve (SH), (ii) uniformly heating of non-restrained samples to 250 oC, and (iii) moderate unilateral fire exposure, 350 oC, of restrained samples. Changes in material properties caused by the fire exposure were studied by means of ultrasonic pulse velocity, full field-strain measurements during uniaxial compression core tests, polarization and fluorescence microscopy (PFM), water absorption and non-steady state chloride migration. The study shows that fire exposure influences different properties of importance for load carrying capacity and durability. To get a clear image of the fire damage one has to combine different test methods during damage assessments. Transport properties of concrete both with and without addition of PP fibres were considerably affected even at moderate fire exposure. Hence, the service life might be reduced. All series with addition of PP fibres exhibited higher water absorption compared to the series without PP fibres. The practical importance of this might, however, be small since also the water absorption of concrete without PP fibres was considerably affected for the fire scenarios considered in this study. Behind the fire exposed surface, i. e., between 30 and 60 mm, no change in water absorption was observed for concrete without PP fibres. However, higher water absorption of the series with addition of PP fibres was observed. Indicative fire tests aimed to evaluate the resistance to fire spalling during a subsequent severe fire was also conducted. The concretes with addition of PP fibres showed no signs of fire spalling, while progressive spalling was observed for the concrete without PP fibres. QC 20150603 </p...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{the fire}} {{resistance}} rating of Light gauge steel frame (LSF) wall systems is based on approximate prescriptive methods developed using limited fire tests. These fire tests are conducted using <b>standard</b> fire <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curve</b> given in ISO 834. However, in recent times fire {{has become a major}} disaster in buildings due to the increase in fire loads as a result of modern furniture and lightweight construction, which make use of thermoplastics materials, synthetic foams and fabrics. Therefore a detailed research study into the performance of load bearing LSF wall systems under both standard and realistic design fires on one side was undertaken to develop improved fire design rules. This study included both full scale fire tests and numerical studies of eight different LSF wall systems conducted for both the standard fire curve and the recently developed realistic design fire curves. The use of previous fire design rules developed for LSF walls subjected to non-uniform elevated temperature distributions based on AISI design manual and Eurocode 3 Parts 1. 2 and 1. 3 was investigated first. New simplified fire design rules based on AS/NZS 4600, North American Specification and Eurocode 3 Part 1. 3 were then proposed with suitable allowances for the interaction effects of compression and bending actions. The importance of considering thermal bowing, magnified thermal bowing and neutral axis shift in the fire design was also investigated and their effects were included. A spread sheet based design tool was developed based on the new design rules to predict the failure load ratio versus time and temperature curves for varying LSF wall configurations. The accuracy of the proposed design rules was verified using the fire test and finite element analysis results for various wall configurations, steel grades, thicknesses and load ratios under both standard and realistic design fire conditions. A simplified method was also proposed to predict the {{fire resistance rating}} of LSF walls based on two sets of equations developed for the load ratio-hot flange temperature and the time-temperature relationships.

40|$|Light {{gauge steel}} frame (LSF) wall systems are {{increasingly}} used in {{residential and commercial}} buildings as load bearing and non-load bearing elements. Conventionally, the Fire Resistance Levels (FRL) of such building elements are determined using approximate prescriptive methods based on limited standard fire tests. However, {{recent studies have shown}} that in some instances real building fire <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curves</b> could be more severe than the standard fire curve, in terms of maximum temperature and rate of temperature rise. This has caused problems for safe evacuation and rescue activities, and in some instances has also lead to the collapse of buildings earlier than the prescribed fire resistance. Therefore a detailed research study into the performance of LSF wall systems under both standard fire and realistic fire conditions was undertaken using full scale fire tests to understand the fire performance of different LSF wall configurations. Both load bearing and non-load bearing full scale fire tests were performed on LSF walls configurations with varying number of plasterboard linings, and stud section sizes. The non-load bearing fire test results were utilized to understand the factors affecting the fire resistance of LSF walls, while load bearing fire test results were used to understand the effects exposure to realistic design fire <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curves.</b> This paper presents the results of full scale experimental study on different wall configurations, highlights the effects of realistic design fire <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curves</b> on wall panels and the factors affecting the fire resistance of LSF walls...|$|R

30|$|The Eurocode offers {{general rules}} for {{structural}} fire design of concrete structures (CEN 2004). It is generally sufficient {{to assume a}} fully developed ventilation controlled compartment fire with a uniform temperature distribution and to only verify individual members directly exposed to fire (Thomas 1986). For this purpose, standardised testing of internal members using pre-defined <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curves</b> have been developed, e.g. the standard fire curve in EN 1363 – 1 and ISO 834, the hydrocarbon (HC) curve in EN 1363 – 2, or the Rijkswaterstaat (RWS) curve from the Dutch regulations. Members are classified according {{to the number of}} minutes that load-bearing capacity (R), integrity (E) or insulation (I) is ensured. A more performance-based alternative to the standardised fires is to develop a unique <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curve</b> given actual fire load and conditions, see for example the Natural fire safety concept (Sleich et al. 2002). An attempt to develop a similar concept for performance-based tunnel design can be found in (Gehandler et al. 2014 b).|$|R
40|$|An {{idealized}} {{temperature curve}} of compartment fire has three, distinct phases: growth phase, steady-burning (or fully developed) phase, and decay phase. Standard temperature-time curves are {{not suitable for}} describing the fire phenomena {{because it does not}} take into account fire load nor ventilation conditions, and fire according to these curves never decays. The temperature curve of compartment fire, especially the growth phase, may be treated like pulse phenomena. This means that it is possible to approximate the fire development with some suitable function that satisfactory describes the pulse phenomena. The shape of the <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curve</b> for fire with flashover has characteristic peak before the decay phase, or slow decreases before the decay phase - in absence of flashover. In this paper we propose the definition of the <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curve</b> by means of a unique function in which the quantities of fuel and ventilation conditions are defined with parameters. This function is very convenient for approximation of the development of compartment fire with flashover, for smouldering combustion which has fire curve without characteristic peak, this function can be used only for approximation of growth period of fire...|$|R

40|$|Acetamide is a {{promising}} phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal storage,but the large supercooling during the freezing process has limited its application. In this study, we prepared acetamide-SiO 2 composites by adding nano-SiO 2 into acetamide. This modified PCM was then impregnated into the porous graphite foam forming acetamide-SiO 2 -graphite foam form-stable composites. These composites {{were subjected to}} melting-solidification cycles 50 times; the <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curves</b> were tracked and recorded during these cycles. The <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curves</b> showed that, for the acetamide containing 2 [*]wt. % SiO 2, the supercooling phenomenon was eliminated and the material’s performance was stable for 50 cycles. The solidification temperature of the acetamide-SiO 2 -graphite foam samples was 65 °C and the melting temperature was lowered to 65 °C. The samples exhibited almost no supercooling {{and the presence of}} SiO 2 had no significant effect on the melting-solidification temperature. The microscopic supercooling of the acetamide-SiO 2 composite was measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results indicated that when the content of SiO 2 was 1 [*]wt. to 2 [*]wt. %, the supercooling could be reduced to less than 10 °C and heat was sufficiently released during solidification. Finally, a set of algorithms was derived using MATLAB software for simulating the crystallization of samples based on the classical nucleation theory. The results of the simulation agreed with the experiment results...|$|R
