25|$|The seed {{propagation}} requires numerous months of stratification for effective germination. Seeds {{generally do not}} germinate well directly after harvesting or in dry storage, but germinate well in cold moist sand. Low temperature treatments facilitate the germination process. Chilling treatments are useful to overcome the dormancy of seeds in dry storage. Domestic seeds germinate more effectively than wild ones. The plant propagates readily by root <b>suckering,</b> allowing it to produce indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|The 4th-century BC Greek writer Theophrastus left a {{detailed}} record of some Greek influences and innovations in viticulture, {{one of which}} was the study of vineyard soils and their proper match to specific grapevines. Another innovation was the minimization of yields for more intense concentration of flavors and quality, rather than increased quantity. The economics of the time favored high yields for most crops, and intentionally limiting agricultural output was exceedingly uncommon in the ancient world. Theophrastus also detailed the practice of using <b>suckering</b> and plant cuttings for new vineyard plantings. The Greeks also employed vine training with stacked plants for easier cultivation and harvesting, rather than let the grapevines grow untrained in bushes or up trees.|$|E

25|$|The {{causal agent}} of {{bacterial}} wilt and canker of tomato survives in or on seeds {{for up to}} 8 months but occasionally also in plant refuse in the soil. The pathogen can be spread long distances because of its association with seeds. The risk of spreading the bacteria to healthy tomato plants is greatest during transplanting, tying, and <b>suckering</b> or any time when the host may be wounded. Once the bacteria enters the plant through a wound, it will move and multiply primarily in the xylem vessels. Once established, the bacteria may move into the phloem, pith, and cortex. Infection can result in either systemic or superficial disease. Systemic infections appear in 3–6 weeks {{and the risk of}} secondary infection goes up with water-splashing. The common occurrence of latent infections – presence of the pathogen within the host yet the host shows no symptoms – makes this pathogen especially dangerous.|$|E
500|$|All banksias have {{developed}} proteoid or cluster roots {{in response to}} the nutrient-poor conditions of Australian soils (particularly lacking in phosphorus). The root system of the <b>suckering</b> forms of Banksia marginata in Victoria and South Australia have a characteristic pattern with a deep tap root, and an extensive system of thick lateral roots [...] below the surface.

The tree grows rapidly and is capable of reaching heights of [...] in 25years. However, the species is also short lived and rarely lives more than 50years, though its remarkable <b>suckering</b> ability makes it possible for this tree to clone itself indefinitely and live considerably longer [...] (since they are linked to the mother tree and thus partly fed by it, the suckers are less vulnerable than the seedlings and can grow faster).|$|E
40|$|During {{the growth}} of sago palm (Metroxylon sagu Rottb.), primary <b>suckers</b> appear from the main stem (MS) of transplanted <b>suckers.</b> Then, {{secondary}} <b>suckers</b> appear from the primary <b>suckers.</b> After the MS (trunk) is first harvested 10 and several years after transplantation, trunks can be harvested persistently using the primary, secondary, and subsequent <b>suckers,</b> which are designated as derivative <b>suckers,</b> growing with the MS. However, little knowledge exists about the growth behavior of derivative <b>suckers.</b> This study clarified how derivative <b>suckers,</b> especially the primary and secondary <b>suckers,</b> spread in the horizontal direction, and how they form a plant with the MS during the creeping growth stage. Most derivative <b>suckers</b> crept {{in the direction of}} about 70 ° subtended by the mother stem. However, two primary <b>suckers</b> that appeared early after transplantation crept in an obtuse angle to the creeping direction of the MS. As the reason for this obtuse angle direction, we considered the following four factors: (1) the existence of petiole, (2) distance from the <b>sucker</b> to the ground surface, (3) enlargement of the MS, and (4) space for <b>sucker</b> growth. The growth behaviors of the two primary <b>suckers</b> and the other derivative <b>suckers</b> differed. Therefore, in sago palm cultivation, the two primary <b>suckers</b> which appeared first from the MS were very important for formation of the framework of the plant with the MS, in terms of efficient utilization of space for {{the growth of}} derivative <b>suckers...</b>|$|R

500|$|Banksia dentata {{is often}} found with Melaleuca and Pandanus species. On Cape York, it is a {{dominant}} component {{in a low}} scrub known as [...] "wet desert" [...] due to its resemblance to arid scrub yet occurring in a monsoon climate. On phosphorus-poor soils, Banksia dentata is found with Melaleuca saligna and Thryptomene oligandra. On Melville Island it is a dominant component of Banksia low woodland, forming part of a [...] high canopy with Melaleuca viridiflora; the understory is composed of sedges such as Fimbristylis, Sorghum intrans, Eriachne, Germainia grandiflora and the restiad Dapsilanthus spathaceus, as well as <b>suckering</b> shrubs Lophostemon lactifluus and Syzygium eucalyptoides.

500|$|It is {{widespread}} as an understory species in medium rainfall eucalypt forests across Victoria, occurring {{in association with}} manna gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), narrow-leaf peppermint (E.radiata), messmate (E.obliqua), swamp gum (E.ovata) and brown stringybark (E.baxteri). It is a common shrub, sometimes small tree, in heathy and shrubby forests as well as coastal scrub and heath in part of its range. In South Gippsland, it is generally a shrub which regenerates from a lignotuber or suckers after bushfire and sets few seed. It has been recorded as a low spreading shrub in Croajingolong National Park in East Gippsland. In the Wombat State Forest west of Melbourne, it grows as a [...] high shrub on less fertile soils, and as a large tree to [...] on more fertile soils. Few trees remain, having been cleared for agriculture or for fuel. Similarly, further west in the Corangamite region, it is either a tree or <b>suckering</b> shrub.|$|E
500|$|The {{tree was}} first brought from China to Europe in the 1740s {{and to the}} United States in 1784. It {{was one of the}} first trees brought west during a time when chinoiserie was {{dominating}} European arts, and was initially hailed as a beautiful garden specimen. However, enthusiasm soon waned after gardeners became familiar with its <b>suckering</b> habits and its foul smelling odour. Despite this, it was used extensively as a street tree during much of the 19th century. Outside Europe and the United States the plant has been spread to many other areas beyond its native range. In a number of these, it has become an invasive species due to its ability both to colonise disturbed areas quickly and to suppress competition with allelopathic chemicals. It is considered a noxious weed in Australia, the United States, New Zealand and many countries of central, eastern and southern Europe. The tree also resprouts vigorously when cut, making its eradication difficult and time-consuming. In many urban areas, it has acquired the derisive nicknames of [...] "ghetto palm", [...] "stink tree", and [...] "tree of Hell".|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Upper Klamath Lake in {{southern}} Oregon has {{two species of}} lacustrine <b>suckers,</b> Lost River <b>sucker</b> Deltistes luxatus and shortnose <b>sucker</b> Chasmistes brevirostris that were historically abundant. Results of surveys performed in the mid- 1980 's indicated that populations of both species were declining and ageing with apparent recruitment failure in most years since 1970. In 1988 both species were listed as endangered species and high priority {{has been placed on}} investigating recruitment of Upper Klamath Lake <b>suckers.</b> Lapilli are the preferred otolith for ageing <b>suckers.</b> Lapilli form predictably on the day of hatch, have the most conservative morphology of the three otoliths, and deposit easily discernable increments that begin on the day of hatch and proceed daily, and grow in a predictable relationship with somatic growth. Ages estimated by otolith analysis and resulting hatch dates of young-of-the-year Lost River <b>sucker</b> and shortnose <b>sucker</b> were consistent annually and consistent with reported spawning period for <b>suckers</b> from Upper Klamath Lake. Otolith increment analysis is necessarily lethal, whereas scale circuli analysis is not lethal. My findings suggest that scale circuli count is an inefficient estimator of daily Daily age estimates for age in young-of-the-year Lost River <b>sucker</b> and shortnose <b>sucker.</b> any given circuli count varied by approximately 51 days in Lost River <b>sucker</b> and 30 days Additionally, my results do not accurately predict the size or age at in shortnose <b>sucker.</b> which scales are formed, thereby invalidating an assumption of age and growth models. Consequently, scale circuli analysis cannot be used to produce accurate estimates of age or growth for young-of-the-year Lost River <b>sucker</b> and shortnose <b>sucker.</b> Lost River <b>sucker</b> and shortnose <b>sucker</b> achieve a relatively large size by the autumn of their first year, consistent with other members of Catostomidae. Interspecific difference in growth rates was evident in each year with Lost River <b>sucker</b> exhibiting faster growth than shortnose <b>sucker</b> in each year. Abundance of young-of-the-year <b>suckers</b> {{does not appear to be}} strongly correlated to somatic growth rate, though hatch date and environmental parameters are highly correlated with abundance. In both Lost River <b>sucker</b> and shortnose <b>sucker,</b> in years with the highest abundance (1991 and 1993), the mean hatch dates of surviving fish were later than in years with the lowest abundance. Also, young-of-the-year Lost River <b>sucker</b> and shortnose <b>sucker</b> experienced wide environmental fluctuations in Upper Klamath Lake as seasonal limnological and climatic variation create a dynamic habitat for young <b>suckers.</b> Water temperature, precipitation, air temperature, and minimum lake elevation are all strongly correlated to abundance of young-of-the-year <b>suckers...</b>|$|R

Propagation from cuttings is very difficult for this species and Grafting onto Myoporum rootstock is preferred for this species in domestic gardens to avoid the problems of <b>suckering.</b> Its frost tolerance, and hardiness in drought, makes it a species that is noted for inclusion in difficult gardens, however it can cause skin irritation in some people.|$|E
2500|$|Elm {{propagation}} methods {{vary according}} to elm type and location, and the plantsman's needs. Native species may be propagated by seed. In their natural setting native species, such as wych elm and European White Elm in central and northern Europe and Field Elm in southern Europe, set viable seed in ‘favourable' seasons. Optimal conditions occur after a late warm spring. After pollination, seeds of spring-flowering elms ripen and fall {{at the start of}} summer (June); they remain viable for only a few days. They are planted in sandy potting-soil at a depth of one centimetre, and germinate in three weeks. Slow-germinating American Elm will remain dormant until the second season. Seeds from autumn-flowering elms ripen in the Fall and germinate in the spring. Since elms may hybridize within and between species, seed-propagation entails a hybridisation risk. In unfavourable seasons elm seeds are usually sterile. Elms outside their natural range, such as Ulmus procera in England, and elms unable to pollinate because pollen-sources are genetically identical, are sterile and are propagated by vegetative reproduction. Vegetative reproduction is also used to produce genetically identical elms (clones). Methods include the winter transplanting of root-suckers; taking hardwood cuttings from vigorous one-year-old shoots in late winter, taking root-cuttings in early spring; taking softwood cuttings in early summer; grafting; ground and air layering; and micropropagation. A bottom heat of 18 degrees and humid conditions are maintained for hard- and softwood cuttings. The transplanting of root-suckers remains the easiest and commonest propagation-method for European Field Elm and its hybrids. For 'specimen' urban elms, grafting to wych-elm root-stock may be used to eliminate <b>suckering</b> or to ensure stronger root-growth. The mutant-elm cultivars are usually grafted, the ‘weeping' elms 'Camperdown' and 'Horizontalis' at , the dwarf cultivars 'Nana' and 'Jacqueline Hillier' at ground level. Since the Siberian Elm is drought-tolerant, in dry countries new varieties of elm are often root-grafted on this species.|$|E

40|$|Biomechanical {{properties}} of squid <b>suckers</b> were studied to provide {{inspiration for the}} development of <b>sucker</b> artefacts for a robotic octopus.

The squid <b>suckers</b> were also directly tested to obtain sucking forces by a special testing arrangement. Inspired by the squid <b>suckers,</b> three types of <b>sucker</b> artefacts were developed for the arm skin of an octopus inspired robot. The first <b>sucker</b> artefact made of knitted nylon sheet reinforced silicone rubber has the same shape as the squid <b>suckers.</b> Like real squid <b>suckers,</b> this type of artefact also has a stalk that is connected to the arm skin and a ring to give radial support.

The final design of the <b>sucker</b> has a cylindrical base and a concave meniscus top. The meniscus was formed naturally using the surface tension of silicone gel, which leads to a higher level of the liquid around the edge of a container.

40|$|Ecomorphological {{specialization}} within Catostomidae {{in several}} large western North American lakes has produced populations including typical benthic <b>suckers</b> (Catostomus) and lakesuckers (Chasmistes), mid-water planktivores, with {{a continuum of}} morphologies existing between them. All extant lakesuckers are endangered, and population declines have been attributed in part to hybridization with sympatric Catostomus spp. Chapter 2 describes assessment for concordance of morphological and genetic variation in <b>suckers</b> in Utah Lake, Utah (June <b>sucker,</b> Chasmistes liorus; Utah <b>sucker,</b> Catostomus ardens; and <b>suckers</b> of intermediate morphology) by comparing a morphological analysis with amplified fragment length polymorphism and microsatellite analyses. <b>Suckers</b> were differentiated using characters associated with presumed feeding strategies: zooplanktivory (June <b>sucker)</b> and benthivory (Utah <b>sucker).</b> No molecular evidence was found for deep genetic divergence between morphs or for hybridization among ancient lineages. Slight population structuring accompanied substantial morphological variation. Chapter 3 describes the investigation of distribution and movement, spawning behavior, and diet of <b>suckers</b> in Utah Lake and their growth at different densities in a laboratory experiment. Acoustic / radio telemetry revealed little difference in movement and distribution of June <b>sucker</b> and Utah <b>sucker</b> or in timing of spawning runs. Stable isotopes analysis revealed that Utah <b>sucker</b> were enriched in 13 C relative to June <b>sucker</b> as presumed diets would predict. Intermediate morphs were intermediate for δ 13 C and δ 15 N. Neither species nor density {{was a significant predictor}} of growth rate of June <b>sucker</b> or Utah <b>sucker</b> reared at different conspecific densities. Chapter 4 examines morphology, genetics, and diet of the <b>sucker</b> population inJackson Lake, Wyoming, once home of the extinct Snake River <b>sucker,</b> Chasmistes muriei, a lakesucker known from a single specimen. Currently, <b>suckers</b> in Jackson Lake are identified as Utah sucker; however, recently sampled individuals resemble lakesucker. No molecular evidence was found for deep genetic divergence between lakesucker and benthic morphs or for hybridization among ancient lineages. The benthic morph was significantly enriched in 13 C relative to the lakesucker morph, consistent with presumed diets.
