50|$|The roof is a {{pyramidal}} {{shape with}} a <b>truncated</b> <b>apex</b> {{to allow a}} square ventilator on top.

They are made of flat galvanized sheet and are also lined with the same insulating material as the roof. The sheeting on the western side of the ventilator clearly shows an imprint of the queen's head and the number 33 underneath. A shaped piece of iron lying inside the building indicates that the damper over this ventilator was also pyramidal in shape.|$|R

50|$|Cistus grancanariae is a shrub, usually 60 - 120 cm high, densely branched, with grey-green leaves {{clustered}} {{towards the}} end of the branches. The oppositely arranged leaves are around 1.5 - 4 cm long by 5 - 18 mm wide, with three (or occasionally up to five) very obvious main veins. The upper sides of the leaves are covered with short stellate (star-shaped) hairs and long simple hairs, some glandular. The undersides of the leaves are whitish and more densely covered with hairs. The flowers are arranged in cymes, with 3-25 flowers to each inflorescence. Individual flowers are 18 - 28 mm across. The petals are white, more-or-less rounded, about 8 - 14 mm long and wide, with a wavy <b>truncated</b> <b>apex</b> and a short narrowed pale yellow tinged base. There are 35-70 stamens, longer than the pistil, with filaments 2 - 4.5 cm long. The style is very short, usually less than 0.6 mm long.

5000|$|Most recently, {{the eastern}} {{terminus}} of LA 24 was <b>slightly</b> <b>truncated</b> in 2015 {{when the final}} 0.37 mi of the route were transferred to Lafourche Parish. [...] The designation formerly extended past LA 3235 and looped under the West Larose Lift Bridge on LA 1 to intersect that highway at the bridge's eastern approach. This route forced trucks to navigate a tight right-angle turn immediately after a low clearance crossing under the lift bridge. The extension of LA 3235 from Galliano to Larose in the early 2000s eliminated this hazard, and signs now direct all through traffic to turn onto LA 3235 to reach LA 1, although the connection to northbound LA 1 is less direct.|$|R

40|$|Colloidal {{cerium oxide}} (CeO 2) nanocrystals {{prepared}} by hydrothermal synthesis {{were characterized by}} high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and three-dimensional electron tomography (3 D-ET). HRTEM images of individual CeO 2 nanocrystals were then simulated by Blochwave and multislice simulations to determine the atomic arrangement and terminating atoms. The edge length distributions were between 5. 0 and 8. 0 nm with an average edge length of 6. 7 nm. The HRTEM images showed that the CeO 2 particles were <b>slightly</b> <b>truncated</b> revealing { 220 } facets. 3 D-ET revealed that the CeO 2 nanocrystals exposed predominantly { 200 } cubic facets.

5000|$|Cooksville was {{incorporated}} in December 1901. The {{population of the}} town peaked in 1910 with 332 people.

40|$|Oculo-dento-digital {{dysplasia}} (ODDD, OMIM no. 164210) is a pleiotropic disorder characterized {{mainly by}} ocular anomalies, {{varying degrees of}} finger and toe syndactyly, and enamel defects. It is caused by missense mutations in the gene coding for the gap junction protein connexin 43 or GJA 1. Other types of mutations have {{so far not been}} reported. Here we describe a Dutch kindred with ODDD showing a new symptom, palmoplantar keratoderma, and associated with a novel 2 -bp deletion mutation of GJA 1. The dinucleotide deletion 780 _ 781 delTG is located in the cytoplasmic C-terminal loop and leads to a frameshift.
