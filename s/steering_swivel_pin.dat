5000|$|It {{consisted}} of two sticks crossed together in the centre and set on a <b>swivel</b> <b>pin</b> in a block of wood called the Stoc. A pin of wood is fixed {{in each of the}} four extremities of the sticks, and round thus, a hank of thread is placed, which is unravelled and made into a ball, as the operator spins the instrument round.|$|R
50|$|In 1951 a KCWBC VIII {{was entered}} {{for the first}} time into the University Women's Rowing Association Eights Regatta in Oxford. It was also the first time that they had rowed on <b>swivel</b> <b>pins.</b> The crew made it through to the second round where they drew with Oxford, forcing a half course re-row which they regrettably lost. However, the same year saw the club win the Durham Intercollegiate Ladies Challenge Cup.|$|R
50|$|Many modern cars use {{rack and}} pinion {{steering}} mechanisms, where the steering wheel turns the pinion gear; the pinion moves the rack, which is a linear gear that meshes with the pinion, converting circular motion into linear motion along the transverse axis of the car (side to side motion). This motion applies steering torque to the <b>swivel</b> <b>pin</b> ball joints that replaced previously used kingpins of the stub axle of the steered wheels via tie rods and a short lever arm called the steering arm.|$|R
50|$|Rowlock - Pronounced Rolick. A 'U' shaped metal {{device that}} secures an oar and {{acts as a}} fulcrum during the motion of rowing. Sometimes called an oarlock in the USA. The Rowlock is {{attached}} with a <b>swivelling</b> <b>pin</b> to the gunwale in a row boat. Commonly made from galvanized steel, bronze or plastic. Before the availability of metal the oar was normally levered against 2 wooden pins called Thole pins inserted in the gunwale. Tholepins are still used in some third world nations. In a narrow row boat the rowlocks are held well outboard in a lightweight outrigger (rigger) which is often equipped with a locking pin to hold the oar securely.|$|R
50|$|Independent front {{suspension}} {{developed through}} the 1930s, for high-performance cars at least, often using double wishbone suspension. This performance also encouraged {{the reduction of}} unsprung weight. Rather than using separate pivots for both the up-and-down motion of the suspension and the <b>steering</b> <b>swivel,</b> {{the use of a}} spherical ball joint that could move in two degrees of freedom allowed the same joint to carry out both functions. The hub carrier extended vertically to span the ends of both wishbones, with a ball joint at each end. In the 1950s and 1960s, such independent suspension became commonplace through light cars in all price ranges. Although the kingpin was no longer an identifiable physical component, suspension geometry was still designed in terms of a virtual kingpin along a line between the ball joint centres.|$|R
50|$|An {{internal}} combustion engine is acted upon by {{the pressure of the}} expanding combustion gases in the combustion chamber space {{at the top of the}} cylinder. This force then acts downwards through the connecting rod and onto the crankshaft. The connecting rod is attached to the piston by a <b>swivelling</b> gudgeon <b>pin</b> (US: wrist pin). This pin is mounted within the piston: unlike the steam engine, there is no piston rod or crosshead (except big two stroke engines).|$|R
40|$|Release {{mechanism}} ensures reliable {{separation of}} structural members while imparting minimal impulse to members. Includes {{set of three}} hooks and pistons holding toggle and thereby clamp plate to body of mechanism. In locked position, pistons down, and hooks held against toggle. In unlocked position, pistons up. Notches in pistons let hook <b>swivel</b> on pivot <b>pins.</b> Functions even when two of its three key elements fail...|$|R
50|$|Name tags may be {{attached}} to garments with adhesive or worn {{with the assistance of}} a magnet or pin. Plastic or metal name tags can {{be attached}} to various backings used to attach to the clothing of the wearer. There are many types of name tag backings, including magnetic backings, locking <b>pins,</b> <b>swivel</b> clips, military clutch pins, alligator clips, and cell phone attachments. Magnetic backings, because they do not puncture clothing with pins, have recently become more popular for name tags. Some name tags are worn around the neck using a lanyard or necklace.|$|R
25|$|In the {{south-west}} corner was a {{group of}} objects which may have been hung up, but when discovered, were compressed together. They included a Coptic or eastern Mediterranean bronze bowl with drop handles and figures of animals, found below a badly deformed six-stringed Anglo-Saxon lyre in a beaver-skin bag, of a Germanic type found in wealthy Anglo-Saxon and north European graves of this date. Uppermost was a large and exceptionally elaborate three-hooked hanging bowl of Insular production, with champleve enamel and millefiori mounts showing fine-line spiral ornament and red cross motifs and with an enamelled metal fish mounted to <b>swivel</b> on a <b>pin</b> within the bowl.|$|R
50|$|Some bowls {{have clearly}} Christian motifs on their escutcheons. The spiral {{ornament}} developed through the 6th to 7th century {{invention of the}} 'trumpet-spiral' pattern, which was afterwards adopted from these enamels and incorporated into the repertoire of the famous painted Gospel-books such as the Book of Durrow or the Lindisfarne Gospels. This painted decoration was certainly intended for meditative contemplation and as a devotional work. From the very mixed cultures and beliefs of the inhabitants of Britain during the Dark Ages, the art, and perhaps {{some part of the}} function of these bowls became absorbed into the Celto-Saxon ornamental language of Christian Britain. Among the finest examples is the large bowl from the Sutton Hoo ship-burial (near Woodbridge, Suffolk), which has an enameled fish sculpture set to <b>swivel</b> on a <b>pin</b> within the bowl.|$|R
