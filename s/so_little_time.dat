5|$|United won {{a corner}} {{just as the}} fourth {{official}} indicated three minutes of injury time, and with <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> left for an equaliser, Peter Schmeichel ventured up to Bayern's penalty area. Beckham flighted the corner in just over Schmeichel's head, Dwight Yorke put the ball back towards the crowded area, and after Thorsten Fink failed to clear sufficiently, the ball arrived {{at the feet of}} Ryan Giggs {{on the edge of the}} area. His right-footed snap-shot was weak and poorly struck, but it went straight to Sheringham, who swiped at the shot with his right foot, and nestled the ball in the bottom corner of the net. The goal was timed at 90+0:36'. It looked as if, having been behind for most of the match, United had forced extra time.|$|E
25|$|Is {{he going}} to throw it away? Is {{he going to}} beat him with it? Or even kill him with it? Beckett’s plays often have a certain open-endedness and this sketch is no different. Perhaps because it has taken <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> to build up to this climax it lacks the {{resonance}} of Endgame’s concluding scene where we never know if Clov ever leaves Hamm or the close of Happy Days where the audience is left wondering if Willie is reaching for the gun or for Winnie.|$|E
25|$|Malibu is {{the setting}} for the {{television}} series Two and a Half Men. The television series <b>So</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Time</b> (2001) portrayed two Malibu teens (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) who attend the fictional school West Malibu High. Fictional teen star Hannah Montana / Miley Stewart (portrayed by Miley Cyrus) and her father Robbie Ray Stewart (portrayed by Billy Ray Cyrus) live in Malibu on the Disney Channel Original Series, Hannah Montana. In the Fox TV series The O.C., both the Cohen house and the Cooper homes were actually located in Malibu. Malibu Shores, a teen drama that aired on NBC, was set in Malibu. Some scenes from The Even Stevens Movie were filmed on Westward Beach in Point Dume. The small hit TV show Summerland was also filmed and set in Malibu.|$|E

25|$|To {{compose the}} music for Broadchurch, Ólafur read the show's scripts to put himself in the right mood. He also {{researched}} sounds which might be heard in Dorset {{as a means of}} inspiration. As with most of his music, he then improvised at the piano. He composed several themes, some for the series as a whole and some for specific characters. He then shared them with Chibnall, and together they picked out the themes they liked best. Using synthesizers or electronic sound generators, Ólafur also composed sounds to be heard when action occurred in certain spaces, such as the cliffs. Once he saw the completed footage for the first episode, he rearranged some themes to fit the imagery, and composed several new themes as well. Because there was <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> between his being hired and the air date, Ólafur composed very quickly and spent extraordinarily long days at work. He had just four months to generate about 30 minutes of sound and music for each episode, spending one-and-a-half to two weeks on each episode. Despite the time crunch, Ólafur credited Chibnall's relaxed attitude as the key to the music's success.|$|E

500|$|The English {{translation}} for Secret of Mana {{was completed}} in only 30 days, mere weeks after the Japanese release, and the North American localization was initially advertised as Final Fantasy Adventure 2. Critics {{have suggested that the}} translation was done hastily so that the game could be released in North America for the 1993 holiday season. According to translator Ted Woolsey, {{a large portion of the}} game's script was cut out in the English localization due to space limitations. To display text on the main gameplay screen, the English translation uses a fixed-width font, which limits the amount of space available to display text. Woolsey was unhappy that he had to trim conversations to their bare essentials and that he had <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> for translation, commenting that it [...] "nearly killed me". The script was difficult to translate as it was presented to Woolsey in disordered groups of text, like [...] "shuffling a novel". Other localizations were done in German and French. The Japanese release only named the three protagonists in the manual, while Western versions omitted the characters' names until the enhanced port on the iOS.|$|E

500|$|Despite the band's {{annoyance}} {{at having}} <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> to prepare, the Kingsmen {{walked into the}} recording studio on April 6 at 10:00am. In order {{to sound like a}} live performance, the group's equipment was arranged such that Ely was forced to lean back and sing into a boom microphone suspended high above the floor. [...] "It was more yelling than singing," [...] Ely said, [...] "'cause I was trying to be heard over all the instruments." [...] In addition, he was wearing braces {{at the time of the}} performance, further compounding his infamously slurred words. Ely sang the beginning of the third verse a few bars too early, but realized his mistake and waited for the rest of the band to catch up. In what was thought to be a warm-up, the song was recorded in its first and only take. The Kingsmen were not proud of the version, but their manager liked the rawness of their cover. The B-side was [...] "Haunted Castle", composed by Ely and Don Gallucci, the new keyboardist. However, credit was given to Lynn Easton on both the Jerden and Wand labels. [...] The entire session cost $50, and the band split the difference.|$|E
500|$|After {{seeing the}} {{portrayal}} of Yellowjacket in Ant-Man, the antagonist of the film, McMillian noted, It's hardly a secret that Marvel Studios {{has a bit of}} a problem when it comes to offering up exciting characters for their heroes to fight against ... villains generally fall into one of two camps. There's the Unstoppable Monster ... or there's the Professional White Guy In A Suit With An Ego ... No matter which of the groups the above villains fall into, they share one common purpose: evil. The motivations for evil likely differ—although, invariably, they fall under the umbrella of 'misguided belief in a greater good that doesn't exist'—but that really doesn't matter, because without fail, there will be <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> in the movie to actually properly explore those motivations, meaning that to all intents and purposes, the villain is being evil for reasons of plot necessity and little else ... The strange thing about this is that Marvel's comic books offer a number of wonderful, colorful bad guys who could step outside the above parameters and offer an alternative to the formulaic villains audiences have gotten used to (and arguably bored with) ...

500|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review in}} the June 1796 Critical Review argued, [...] "When {{the character of the}} Maid of Orleans, and the part taken by her against the English, are considered, together with {{the manner in which the}} history has been treated by other writers, some suspicion may at first arise, that Mr. Southey has chosen a subject scarcely suited to the dignity of epic poetry. His prudence at least may be called into question. how can he expect to interest the English nation in the fortunes of a heroine who was an active champion against his own countrymen, or be hardly enough to felicitate those successes that involved the English in disgrace?" [...] In regard to the effort put into writing the poem, the review concluded: [...] "The poetical powers of Mr. Southey are indisputable very superior, and capable, we doubt not, of producing a poem that will place him in the first class of English poets. He is at present, he tells his readers, engaged in the execution of Madoc [...] We cannot, therefore, help expressing our wish, that he would not put his future poem to so hazardous an experiment as he has this, by assigning himself <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> for its completion." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review in}} the November 1794 Critical Review argued that the subject matter would have been appropriate for a tragedy but the events happened too soon to allow {{for it to be}} dealt with in an appropriate manner. The reviewer also commented on the haste of the work and that it [...] "must, therefore, not be supposed to smell very strongly of the lamp. However, the review does praise aspects of the poem, as the author writes, [...] "By these free remarks, we mean not to under-rate Mr. Coleridge's historical drama. It affords ample testimony, that the writer is a genuine votary of the Muse, and several parts of it will afford much pleasure to those who can relish the beauties of poetry. Indeed a writer who could produce so much beauty in <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>time,</b> must possess powers that are capable of raising him to a distinguished place among the English poets." [...] In the British Critic, an anonymous reviewer argued in 1795 that [...] "The sentiments... in many instances are naturally, though boldly conceived, and expressed in language, which gives us reason to think the Author might, after some probation, become no unsuccessful wooer of the tragic muse." ...|$|E

2500|$|... none of {{the major}} {{constitutional}} officers in the State of Illinois designated Springfield as their primary residence; most cabinet officers and all major constitutional officers instead primarily do their business in Chicago. A {{former director of the}} Southern Illinois University Paul Simon Institute for Public Affairs, Mike Lawrence, stated that many of the elected officials in Illinois [...] "spend <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> in Springfield". In 2012 St. Louis Post-Dispatch columnist Pat Gauen argued that because major state politicians such as the Governor of Illinois, as well as the Attorney General, Speaker of the House, the minority leader of the House, President of the Senate, the minority leader of the Senate, the Comptroller, and the Treasurer, all live in the Chicago area; because they work from the James R.

[...] University of Illinois researcher and former member of the Illinois legislature Jim Nowlan stated [...] "It's almost like Chicago is becoming the shadow capital of Illinois" [...] and that [...] "Springfield is almost become a hinterland outpost."
