5|$|Love, Loss, and What I Wore is a play {{written by}} Nora and Delia Ephron {{based on the}} 1995 book {{of the same name}} by Ilene Beckerman. It is {{organized}} as a series of monologues and uses a rotating cast of five principal women.

5|$|The {{construction}} {{of the book and}} the <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poem within it share a metaphorical connection in the decay of memory.

5|$|Stephen King criticised the {{reactions}} of some reviewers to the books, including McCauley, for jumping too quickly to surface conclusions of the work. He felt this was inevitable, because of the extreme secrecy before launch which did not allow reviewers time to read and consider the book, but meant that many early reviews lacked depth. Rather than finding the writing style disappointing, he felt it had matured and improved. He acknowledged that the <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> books had become more adult, and that Rowling had clearly been writing with the adult audience firmly in mind {{since the middle of}} the series. He compared the works in this respect to Huckleberry Finn and Alice in Wonderland which achieved success and have become established classics, in part by appealing to the adult audience as well as children.|$|E

5|$|The Privy Council {{identified}} one of {{the extreme}} circumstances as that which occurred in Wright & Advertiser Newspapers Limited v. Lewis (1990). In this case, the Supreme Court of South Australia held that an action may proceed against a legislator accused of libel where the whole <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alleged libel relates to the legislator's conduct in the legislature so {{that the effect of}} parliamentary privilege is to exclude virtually all the evidence necessary to justify the libel. If such an action is not allowed to proceed, not only will there be injustice to the defendant, but there will also be a real danger that the media will be forced to abstain from the truthful disclosure of the legislator's misbehaviour in Parliament. This would be a most serious inroad into freedom of speech since justification would be impossible.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of express trusts in English law must involve four elements for the trust to be valid: capacity, certainty, constitution and formality. Capacity {{refers to the}} settlor's ability to create a trust in the first place; generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can create a trust. There are exceptions for statutory bodies and corporations, and minors who usually cannot hold property can, in some circumstances, create trusts. Certainty refers to the three certainties required for a trust to be valid. The trust instrument must show certainty of intention to create a trust, certainty of what the <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trust is, and certainty of who the beneficiaries (or objects) are. Where there is uncertainty for whatever reason, the trust will fail, although the courts have developed ways around this. Constitution means that for the trust to be valid, the property must have been transferred from the settlor to the trustees.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court hearing {{took place}} on 11 February 2008 – only {{two days before the}} series was due to premiere. The Nine Network was ordered by a DPP {{subpoena}} to hand over tapes of all 13 episodes, as well as outlines and story lines, to the Victorian Supreme Court by 10am on that date. The Nine Network refused to voluntarily hand over the tapes, saying they were incomplete and that the network's lawyers were closely supervising production. However, it was willing to comply with any Court order and took the matter very seriously. The Network was also adamant that the series makes no assertions about the guilt of the accused killer. At the hearing, which took place at the Geelong Supreme Court, Justice Betty King gave prosecution and defence lawyers 24hours to view the series and return to court the following day to decide whether it had the potential to affect the forthcoming trial. Justice King issued a suppression order on 12 February banning the Nine Network from broadcasting the series in the state of Victoria and on the internet until after the murder trial was completed. The Nine Network offered to air a heavily edited version in Victoria, but the offer was rejected by Justice King. It was initially planned that an alternative program, Underbelly: A Special Announcement, discussing the <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series, would air in Victoria instead of the series premiere. This idea was scrapped, and the movie The Shawshank Redemption was aired in Victoria instead. The Nine Network declared their intention to appeal the decision, and Network lawyers stated that they would exercise all legal options.|$|E
