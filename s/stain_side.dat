50|$|<b>Siding</b> <b>stain</b> is one {{variety of}} wood stain with very high {{viscosity}} (others {{can be quite}} thin). Effectively, <b>siding</b> <b>stains</b> are paints that do not cover as well and do not form a hard film. They are designed to penetrate better and contain binders that are softer and more flexible, allowing them to last longer than harder, more brittle paints. <b>Siding</b> <b>stain</b> protects against solar radiation especially UV radiation, water, fungus including mildew, and insects. Different <b>siding</b> <b>stains</b> are distinguished by the appearance they impart to wood. Certain solvent-based or oil-based <b>siding</b> <b>stains</b> contain small amounts of paraffin wax, which cannot be painted over, although re-staining is still possible.|$|R
50|$|Back Sponging:The <b>stained</b> <b>side</b> of the {{material}} is placed face down on a clean, absorbent, material. The back of the fabric is then sponged with a sponge that is soaked in the solvent being used. It {{is important not to}} rub {{the material}} with the sponge, but to use a padding motion, so as not to spread the stain. The solvent dissolves the stain, which is deposited on the absorbent material beneath. To completely remove the stain {{it may be necessary to}} use more than one absorbent pad.|$|R

40|$|This study {{compared}} the staining potential of two experimental amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouth rinses (A and B), a phenolic/essential oil rinse (C) and a negative control, water, rinse (D). The {{study was a}} single centre, randomized, single-blind, four treatment crossover study design among healthy participants. Prior to each study period, participants received a dental prophylaxis. On the Monday of each period, subjects suspended oral hygiene, and under supervision, rinsed with the allocated mouth rinse immediately followed by a warm black tea solution at hourly intervals eight times a day for 4 days. On Friday, the area and intensity of staining on the teeth, the primary outcome measure and dorsum of tongue were assessed. This regimen was repeated for all the three subsequent treatment periods. Rinse B produced less stain than rinse A, but {{the difference was not}} significant (p[*]=[*] 0. 20). Rinse B produced significantly more stain than rinse C (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) and D (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). For tongue staining, rinse B produced significantly more staining than D (p[*]<[*] 0. 01) but not A or C. Overall, all test rinses produced more staining than placebo with an overall pattern for more staining with stannous formulations. Individuals using stannous or phenolic/essential oil mouth rinse formulations should be advised of the possible <b>staining</b> <b>side</b> effect and that this can be easily removed by a professional dental cleaning...|$|R

40|$|Flow cytometric {{enumeration}} of CD 34 + hematopoietic {{stem and}} progenitor cells (HSCs) {{is widely used}} for evaluation of graft adequacy of peripheral blood and bone marrow stem cell grafts. In the present study, we review and compare the major counting techniques of stem and progenitor cells. The methods are: the Milan/Mullhouse protocol, two-platform ISHAGE (International Society of Hematotherapy and Graft Engineering) and single-platform ISHAGE analysis system. According to the Milan/Mulhouse protocol, HSCs are identified by CD 34 antibody staining and easy gating strategy. The ISHAGE guidelines for detection of CD 34 + cells {{are based on a}} four-parameter flow cytometry method (CD 34 PE/CD 45 PerCP <b>staining,</b> <b>side</b> and forward angle light scatter) thus employing multiparameter gating strategy. With two-platform ISHAGE protocol, an absolute CD 34 + count is generated by incorporating the leukocyte count from an automated hematology analyser. The single-platform ISHAGE method to determine the absolute CD 34 + count directly from a flow cytometer includes the use of Trucount tubes (Becton Dickinson) with a known number of fluorescent beads. CD 34 + cells were quantified in mobilized peripheral blood, collected by leukapheresis, and bone marrow from 42 samples from patients with hematological malignancies. The differences against the means display low disagreement between the Milan/Mulhouse and ISHAGE protocols, with discrepancies of up to 2. 5 % (two-platform ISHAGE) [...] 2. 6 % (single-platform ISHAGE) in enumeration of CD 34 + cells in leukapheresis product and 4. 8 % (two-platform ISHAGE) [...] 4. 9 % (single-platform ISHAGE) in bone marrow. Our results show high correlation among all three methods. Since the three protocols are compatible, choosing the most convenient in terms of costs, simplicity and compliance with clinical results appears to be a logical consequence...|$|R

40|$|Water {{extracts}} from pawpaw seed {{have been reported}} to reversibly decrease the testicular weight and to suppress spermatogenesis, and fertility of Wistar rats. The reversible changes become evident, 30 – 45 days after the withdrawal of the extract. The possible effect of this extract on the activities of steroidogenic enzymes of the testis has not been investigated. Water extract of papaya seeds was administered to male Sprague Dawley rats ad libitum for 84 days. Following the discontinuation of the extracts, ten rats each were sacrificed on days 0, 10, 20 and 30 after the withdrawal. Their testes were quickly dissected out and frozen. Cryostat sections, 10 µm thick were cut. These sections were used for immunohistochemical <b>stains</b> for <b>side</b> chain cleavage enzyme and aromatase, and for histochemical stains for 17 -β Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 3 -β Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.
