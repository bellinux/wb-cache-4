40|$|OBJECTIVES: To explore {{whether the}} {{inhalation}} of coal mine dust {{increases the risk}} of premature death in miners, a survival analysis was conducted in a cohort of 2738 patients with <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> in the Huai-Bei coal mine, in China. METHODS: Age specific mortalities were calculated by disease severity in terms of pneumoconiotic category with the life table method. The progressions from <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> to death or progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) were analysed with the Cox's regression model with time as the dependent variable to identify risk factors. RESULTS: During a follow up period (mean 8 y) 3. 2 % of patients with <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> developed PMF. The patients with development of PMF presented higher age specific mortalities than those remaining in a state of <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> (SMR: 3. 42; P < 0. 01). After adjustment for tuberculosis and duration of work, the relative risk of premature death due to development of PMF was 2. 4. Tuberculosis was found to be a main risk factor which not only facilitated premature death (relative risk (RR) : 2. 0; P < 0. 01), but was also a strong facilitator for development of PMF (RR: 7. 0; P < 0. 01). Also, a long term of work underground and drilling as a main job were identified as risk factors for development of PMF. CONCLUSION: The results imply that patients with <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> will have altered survival, and premature death among them is related to an increased risk of the development of PMF and the complication of tuberculosis...|$|E
40|$|A more {{detailed}} analysis of material from the 20 -year follow-up {{of men in the}} Rhondda Fach confirms the similarity between the Standardised Mortality Ratios (SMRs) of miners and exminers with radiological categories 0, 1, 2, 3 and A (120. 3, 116. 5, 119. 0, 115. 7, and 120. 1 respectively) as well as the difference between these SMRs and that of the non-moners (98. 7). The specific death rates show a raised SMR for bronchitis and other respiratory diseases excluding pneumoconiosis for all categories including category 0, but little difference between those for category 0 and those for <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis.</b> The SMRs for ischaemic heart disease and other circulatory diseases for categories A, B and C combined are lower than those for <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> and category 0 (84. 2 and 85. 0, compared with 109. 8 and 121. 8 for <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis,</b> and 117. 5 and 114. 6 for category 0). Fortunately the SMR for leukaemia is low. A comparison between the survival rates of men aged 55 - 64 in Leigh, Lancashire and those in the Rhondda Fach suggests that nonminers in the two areas have similar survival rates while the survival rates for category 0 and <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> are lower in the Rhondda Fach...|$|E

40|$|An autopsy {{survey of}} 1, 010 Bantu South African coal-miners {{has been carried}} out in order to {{ascertain}} the commonest causes of death and the incidence of cardiorespiratory tuberculosis and of coal-workers' pneumoconiosis. These are consecutive autopsy cases. By law, all miners who die from any cause whatsoever, while still employed by the mines immediately before death, must be autopsied, but few autopsies are performed on repatriated miners who die in their homes. For this reason a serious bias has taken place and this limits the possibility of generalizing from this paper. The commonest cause of death was multiple injuries. Primary carcinoma of the liver was the commonest malignancy and the incidence of bronchogenic carcinoma was low. These are the usual findings in the Bantu. Active tuberculosis of the respiratory organs was found in 12 % of cases. Coal-workers' pneumoconiosis was present in 26 · 8 %, and 94 % of these cases were of the simple type.

Of the 7118 men re-examined, 2547 were still working miners and 4526 {{had left the}} industry (45 were of unrecorded status). The incidence of progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) over an average follow up period of 22 years among men who had remained in the industry was 27 per 1000, but 94 per 1000 among men who had left. This difference was only partly related to the difference in age between the groups; for men without <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> {{at the start of}} the period, and for similar age groups (45 - 64), the attack rate in miners was 20 per 1000 and in the ex-miners 41 per 1000.

50|$|Coal workers' pneumoconiosis, severe state, {{develops}} {{after the}} initial, milder {{form of the}} disease known as anthracosis (anthrac — coal, carbon).

Prolonged exposure to large amounts of coal dust can result in more serious forms of the disease, <b>simple</b> coal workers' <b>pneumoconiosis</b> and complicated coal workers' pneumoconiosis (or progressive massive fibrosis, or PMF). More commonly, workers exposed to coal dust develop industrial bronchitis, clinically defined as chronic bronchitis (i.e. productive cough for 3 months per year for at least 2 years) associated with workplace dust exposure. The incidence of industrial bronchitis varies with age, job, exposure, and smoking. In nonsmokers (who are less prone to develop bronchitis than smokers), studies of coal miners have shown a 16% to 17% incidence of industrial bronchitis.|$|R

40|$|Information {{regarding}} {{adverse health}} effects resulting from exposure to respirable coal mine dust was reviewed {{as a basis for}} the development of new occupational safety and health standards. Evidence indicated that coal mine dust exposures over a working lifetime may result in the development of <b>simple</b> coal workers' <b>pneumoconiosis,</b> progressive massive fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Based on epidemiology studies, a working lifetime exposure to levels of coal dust at the current Mine Safety and Health Administration permissible exposure limit of 2 mg/m 3 increased the risk of developing these disorders. When exposure also occurs to crystalline silica (14808607) at respirable size particles, the danger of developing silicosis or mixed dust pneumoconiosis was also present. NIOSH recommends in this report that the exposures to respirable coal mine dust be limited to 1 mg/m 3 as a time weighted average concentration for up to 10 hours a day during a 40 hour work week.

Methods We present three cases of wood charcoal pneumoconiosis, two due to activated carbon, {{and one from}} wood charcoal artisan handling. To our knowledge, no clinical cases of wood charcoal pneumoconiosis, from artisan handling has been published so far. Clinical Cases the three cases had their X rays classified by two B-readers as p/q round opacities with profusion ranging from 212 to 3 / 3. HRCT of two of them showed a diffuse centrilobular ground glass nodular pattern with subpleural small areas of consolidations. Transbronchial biopsies showed deposition of black pigment in the bronchiolar interstice similar to the histological appearance of <b>simple</b> coal workers <b>pneumoconiosis,</b> with no signs of fibrosis.

Results refer to 52, 264 approximately five year intervals when the miners were at risk of an attack of PMF. One objective {{of the present study was}} to describe how the five year attack rate of PMF was related to miners' age, colliery, and <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> category at the start of the periods at risk. The main objective was to estimate the relation between exposure to dust and incidence of PMF and to examine how this relation changes in the presence of coalworkers' <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> (CWSP). Film readings, in some cases based on clinical assessments only, showed 462 attacks of PMF over the five year risk periods. The men concerned had experienced higher cumulative exposures to dust than their colleagues of similar age at the same collieries, a result found at 65 of the 68 age colliery groups where an attack had occurred. The association was highly significant statistically. <b>Simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> clearly predisposed to PMF, with five year attack rates of 13. 9 %, 12. 5 %, 4. 4 %, and 0. 2 % among men with categories 3, 2, 1, and 0 respectively at the start of the risk periods. Once <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> category 1 or more had been attained, those with higher cumulative exposure to dust were not at greater risk of an attack of PMF than other men with the same CWSP category. Among most miners, those with category 0, however, the risks of an attack of PMF increased clearly with exposure. Risks of an attack were higher among older men irrespective of CWSP category. In addition, there were large colliery specific variations in incidence related to variations in the carbon content of the coal though not fully explained by them. It is concluded that cumulative exposure to respirable dust is the decisive central factor in the development of PMF. Its effect is primarily in causing <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> category 1 or higher which predisposes to PMF, though the dust related incidence among men with category 0 is not negligible in view of the large numbers at risk.

If this suggestion is accepted the mortality rates for miners and ex-miners with <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> seem {{similar to those of the}} same age not exposed to industrial dusts, living in the same area, with similar smoking habits...|$|E
40|$|To help {{inform the}} setting of dust control {{standards}} in coalmines, this brief review summarises the most recent and reliable exposure-response relations, for damaging respiratory effects, derived from the Pneumoconiosis Field Research (PFR). Collecting data over 38 years in the British coal industry, this was a programme of prospective research on the respiratory health of coal miners, characterised by regular health surveys and detailed measurements of dust and silica concentrations in the workplace. Exposure-response relations are presented for coal workers' <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> category II, progressive massive fibrosis, defined deficits of lung function (FEV 1), and category II silicosis. This simplified overview provides {{a guide to the}} most recent and most reliable estimates from the PFR of dust-related risks of substantial pulmonary disease, and to the magnitude of the effects. Control of dust sufficient to prevent category II <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> should prevent most cases of progressive massive fibrosis and most dust related large lung function deficits. Where the dust contains high proportions of silica, control to low levels is essential, and even quite brief excursions of silica to high levels must be avoided...|$|E

Role of dust in {{the working}} {{environment}} in development of chronic bronchitis in British coal miners. In {{the course of a}} long-term prospective study of chronic respiratory disease in British coal miners the effects on pulmonary ventilatory function of exposure to airborne dust, of <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis,</b> and of chronic bronchitis have been examined in a group of 3581 coalface workers...|$|E
40|$|A <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> with {{lamellar}} birefringent crystals {{was observed}} in animals dying in the San Diego Zoo. We studied 100 autopsies from 11 mammalian and eight avian species. In mammals, mild pulmonary lesions comprised crystal-laden macrophages in alveoli and lymphatics. Interstitial fibrosis was present in 20 % of cases. There were no nodules. In birds, dust retention produced large granulomas around tertiary bronchi without fibrosis. Mineralogic analysis using scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed most of the crystals to be silicates. Ninety percent were complex silicates, with aluminum-potassium silicates comprising 70 % of the analyzed particles. Electron and x-ray diffraction showed the silicates to be muscovite mica and its hydrothermal degradation product, ie, illite clay. This mica was also present on filtration membranes of atmospheric air samples obtained from the San Diego Zoo. The amount of dust retention {{was related to the}} animal's age, anatomic or ecologic variances, and length of stay in the San Diego Zoo. Its semidesert atmosphere is rich in silicates, which are inhaled and deposited in the lungs. Similar mica-induced lesions are found in humans living in this region or the Southwest of the USA. This <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> is likely to be widespread in human populations living in desert or semidesert climates...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect on}} lung {{function}} and radiographic indices {{of exposure to}} chrysotile asbestos was investigated by cross-sectional studies in two groups of men at Havelock Mine, Swaziland. The first group consisted of 214 employees and ex-employees, mean age 52, who had been employed for at least 10 years, and whose dust exposure ranged from minimal for surface workers to very heavy {{for those in the}} grading and bagging sections of the mill. In this group 29 % had category 1 or more <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> and 4. 5 % category 2 or more. For surface and mine workers, the estimated annual deterioration in FEV 1 and FVC and the increase in category of pneumoconiosis was similar to that due to age alone, while the heaviest exposure almost doubled the decline in lung function and trebled the rate of progression of pneumoconiosis. The second group consisted of 224 men, mean age 33, all currently working in the mill and having been employed there for at least a year. In this group 30 % had category 1 or more <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis,</b> and 2. 7 % category 2. Exposure in the dustiest sections of the mill more than doubled the estimated annual decline in lung function and doubled the rate of progression of pneumoconiosis...|$|E
40|$|The 1950 I. L. O. {{classification}} of radiological abnormality in <b>simple</b> <b>pneumoconiosis</b> describes four discrete categories, {{but the actual}} amount of abnormality in an individual does not change by discrete steps. Radiological progression is the increase of a continuous variable, and methods of measuring it must deal with three problems: (1) the coarse classification into discrete categories; (2) possible variation {{in the rate of}} an individual's progression from point to point on the continuum of abnormality; (3) the possible non-uniformity of the continuum in relation to some relevant change in the lungs...|$|E

As {{there is}} an increased formation of one or all the fibrous proteins in coalworkers' pneumoconiosis, {{it was felt that}} a study of the turnover rate of these proteins might shed some light on the pathogenesis of the disease.
