40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study what role the Swedish <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> has as a public meal in Swedish culture. An {{additional}} aim is to study the meal patterns of children, including the <b>school</b> <b>meal.</b> An ethnological questionnaire with 192 informants was used to study people’s perceptions and memories of the <b>school</b> <b>meal.</b> The <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> was {{seen as part of}} the Swedish welfare state, but also as a second-class meal, which did not live up to the ideal, which was a meal with the same values as a meal served at home. Observations in school canteens (25 hours), interviews with the <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> staff (six informants) and focus group interviews with children in grade 4 - 5 (seven groups with a total of 52 children) were carried out at three schools in central Sweden. Firstly, the data was analysed as to how the teachers interacted with the children in relation to the pedagogic meal. The teachers took on three different roles:  “the sociable teacher role”, “the educating teacher role” and “the evasive teacher role”. Secondly, the children’s understanding of food and <b>meals</b> in the <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> context was analysed. The results showed that the children used ideas from the adult world among their peers in the <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> situation. This included the implementation of institutional commensality, the telling of stories about food and the classification of foods in dichotomies. A questionnaire covering the meal patterns of the children and intake of some snack foods was also distributed to the children attending grade 4 - 5 at the three schools and their parents. Matched pairs (n= 147) were analysed for agreement. Most children had a regular meal pattern, and there was general agreement between child and parent reports, except for sweets and chocolate. The expectations on the <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> are high. At the same time, {{there appears to be a}} social construction depicting the <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> in a negative way.

40|$|Background: Norwegian children/adolescents do not {{adhere to}} {{guidelines}} regarding fruit, vegetables, sugar or saturated fat. Schools are important arenas {{to promote a}} healthy diet, but there is currently no arrangement for serving a free <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> in Norway. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether serving a free <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> leads to an increased intake of fruit and vegetables, and a lower intake of unhealthy snacks in the intervention group compared to the control group. Methods: The <b>School</b> <b>Meal</b> Project had a quasi-experimental design and the total sample consisted of 55 children in the intervention group and 109 in the control group. A healthy free <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> was served to the intervention group every day for one school year. Intervention effect on intake of fruit, vegetables and unhealthy snacks was assessed by multiple linear and logistic regression analyses adjusted for baseline intake, gender and socio-economic status. Results: The intervention resulted in a significantly increased intake of vegetables on sandwiches (p=. 003), but not in a significantly increased intake of vegetables at dinner, other vegetables (e. g. carrots with lunch), fruit (apple, orange, pear or banana) or other fruits, nor a decreased intake of unhealthy snacks in the intervention compared to the control group. Conclusion: A free <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> resulted in an increased intake of vegetables on sandwiches in the intervention compared to the control group, but did not affect the intake of either the other fruit and vegetable items nor the unhealthy snacks items investigated.

40|$|Socio-ecological health {{improvement}} approaches, such as Health Promoting Schools, emphasise {{the dynamic}} inter-relationships between individuals and environments, such as children's experiences with food in school. Evaluating previous school-based nutritional interventions from a socio-ecological perspective suggests areas where macro policy is ineffective in influencing children's eating behaviour (e. g., some children remain unwilling to consume healthier food). On the other hand, promising {{results have been}} obtained from interventions based on the social interactions between children and <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> staff. The aim of this thesis is to explore how school-based nutritional policies might realise health improvements through understanding the policy and environmental contexts associated with school dining halls, together with the influences on children's eating behaviour of the feeding strategies employed by <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> staff. A qualitative case {{study was conducted in}} one Welsh Local Education Authority (LEA). Observations were carried out in eleven primary school dining halls, supplemented by interviews with participants at multiple socio-ecological levels. LEA and school policies reflected national objectives with respect to nutritional guidelines, but were influenced by multiple, competing interests including pupil's food preferences, and organisational objectives such as protecting <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> uptake. Some dining hall features (e. g., accommodation, negative teacher modelling) had an adverse influence on eating behaviour and many children failed to select and/or consume nutritionally balanced meals. The feeding strategies used by <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> staff were used naturally but inconsistently and were subject to contextual constraints (e. g., time pressures). Higher level policy interventions may have limited effectiveness if undermined by lack of attention to lower level factors compromising their effectiveness. Behavioural approaches based on repeated taste exposure to encourage children to taste the nutritionally balanced meals made available by <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> policies are recommended. As utilising teachers during lunchtimes may be problematic, enrichment of the feeding interactions between <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> staff and children is suggested.

40|$|There is {{a rising}} {{awareness}} {{of the power of}} the public sector in enhancing sustainable consumption and production practices, in particular related to food procurement and its social, ethical, economical and environmental implications. <b>School</b> <b>meal</b> services have a high resonance in the debate on collective catering services because of the implications on the education to sustainable dietary habits and the orientation of the production system.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} first {{findings about}} <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> {{provision in the}} region of North Rhine-Westphalia. This is the German federal state with the highest population and also with the highest number of pupils in Germany. Findings demonstrate that the situation and regulation for <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> provision in this region is somewhat disordered and less structured than for example in the city state of Berlin. The situation is presently changing since the school days have to be longer through the expansion of the allday-schools, regulated by the communal law. Also, the awareness of a healthy offer for lunch is increasing. Within this process, more and more money has been spent by the government in North Rhine-Westphalia to improve the situation, e. g. the “All-day Initiative” (Ganztagsoffensive). A Coordination Centre (Schulvernetzungsstelle) was created to facilitate communication with all schools. It will also build a central point of reference for <b>school</b> <b>meal</b> provision in North Rhine-Westphalia, even though there are no centralised solutions for all schools in this federal state. Every communal school authority or the individual school itself has to find its own system for presenting a lunch offer to the pupils, e. g. with a school-owned canteen or food provided from catering firms.
