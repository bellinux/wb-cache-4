40|$|A novel cyanobacterial mat type is {{characterized}} from near-neutral pH, low sulphide geothermal springs of 45 - 60 °C in the Philippines. Mats were free floating, several metres {{in diameter and}} several cm in thickness. The upper surface of mats was covered in a waxy scytonemin-like layer, solvent extracts of which absorbed light strongly at 384 nm. Light microscopy revealed mats to posses highly ordered layers of air spaces at both the macroscopic and microscopic level, apparently as an adaptation to buoyancy. Morphospecies composition was exclusively filamentous, with Fischerella-like and Oscillatoria-like taxa closely associated throughout mats. Abundant heterocystous cells were observed in Fischerella filaments, suggesting nitrogen fixation occurs in these mats. Morphological structure did not vary among mats from pools of different temperature, but several 16 S rDNA-defined genotypes were resolved by DGGE with some displaying greater thermophily than others. Sequencing of fourteen DGGE bands (Genbank accession numbers: AY 236467 -AY 236480) yielded nine novel Fischerella sequences, whilst the five Oscillatoria sequences showed high similarity to other thermophilic Oscillatoria sequences. These data are relevant to astrobiology in that they expand our knowledge of oxygenic photosynthetic community diversity in geothermal environments, which serve as modern analogues for early life on Earth and other planets.

40|$|Id- 1 is a {{helix-loop-helix protein}} that is overexpressed in {{many types of}} cancer {{including}} esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We previously reported that ectopic Id- 1 expression activates the PI 3 K/Akt signaling pathway in human esophageal cancer cells. In this study, we confirmed {{a positive correlation between}} Id- 1 expression and phospho-Akt in ESCC cell lines, as well as in ESCC tumor tissues from patients. To investigate the significance of Id- 1 in esophageal cancer progression, we also conducted in vivo experiments to compare the tumorigenic and metastatic potential of an Id- 1 -overexpressing ESCC cell line in nude mice with that of the control cell line expressing the empty vector. We found that the Id- 1 overexpressing cancer cells produced significantly larger tumors when inoculated subcutaneously into the flank of nude mice, and pronounced lung metastasis when injected intravenously into the tail vein. The tumor xenografts of esophageal cancer cells with stable ectopic Id- 1 expression showed elevated Ki- 67 proliferation index and increased angiogenesis, as well as reduced apoptosis. Treatment with the PI 3 K inhibitor LY 294002 attenuated the tumor promotion effects of Id- 1, indicating that the effects were mediated by the PI 3 K/Akt signaling pathway. In addition, our in vitro experiments showed that ectopic Id- 1 expression altered the expression levels of markers associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and enhanced the migration ability of esophageal cancer cells. The Id- 1 -overexpressing ESCC cells also exhibited increased invasive potential which was in part due to PI 3 K/Akt-dependent modulation of matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) expression. In conclusion, our results provide the first evidence that Id- 1 promotes tumorigenicity and metastasis of human esophageal cancer in vivo, and that the PI 3 K inhibitor LY 294002 can attenuate these effects.

40|$|AbstractClick {{here and}} insert your {{abstract}} text. Governance of <b>projects,</b> <b>programmes</b> and portfolios {{is an increasing}} research area and practice, {{but it is not}} yet considered to be as mature as it happens with project management concepts and practices. The extant research in this subject focus mainly in two different approaches: the first relates with multi-firm project governance and the second concerning governance of projects, as part of the corporate governance. This paper addresses the disclosure and reporting governance component, under the second approach. The importance of disclosure and reporting governance component is to ensure that <b>projects,</b> <b>programmes</b> and portfolios are aligned with corporation objectives and stakeholders’ expectations. The organization projects’ control system performance indicators should provide the reliable information, required for decision making by the different governance levels: Executive Board level, Contextual level, and Individual Project level. This complete and understandable set of performance indicators, across the projects’ life cycle, is required as an input to evaluate and improve the governance structures, responsibilities, principles and polices applied to <b>projects,</b> <b>programmes</b> and portfolios. This paper is the interim result of an on-going research with the overall aim of evaluates the perceived relevance of the different projects performance indicators, {{in the context of the}} governance of <b>projects,</b> <b>programmes</b> and portfolios. It also intends to evaluate in what conditions that perception is influenced by organization's governance of projects paradigm, governance of projects structure level, project contract types or even by different project types...|$|R
