5|$|At 20:45, with Jason {{far behind}} in the darkness, Mars hauled up and Hood {{attempted}} to manoeuvre into an effective position from which to attack the waiting Hercule. The vagaries of the current in the Raz de Sein passage prevented Hood from handling his ship effectively however and instead he resolved on bringing Mars directly alongside and fighting broadside to broadside. At 21:15 Mars was in range and L'HÃ©ritier opened fire, Hood replying immediately. For ten minutes, the masts and rigging of Mars came under fire, with damage to the bowsprit and foremast, as Hood continued to attempt to hold his firing position against the current before pulling slightly ahead of Hercule at 21:25 and dropping anchor. The port bow anchor became entangled with the <b>starboard</b> <b>anchor</b> on Hercule and the British ship was swung violently into the French ship, {{the force of the}} collision unhinging four of the gunports on Mars.|$|E
5|$|Ballard's {{survey found}} no {{underwater}} penetrations of the ship's fully armoured citadel. Eight holes {{were found in}} the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from Bismarcks port side and struck the <b>starboard</b> <b>anchor</b> chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and {{it is likely that the}} shell penetrated the deck armour only. Huge dents showed that many of the 14inch shells fired by King George V bounced off the German belt armour.|$|E
25|$|America {{had several}} {{differences}} from the lead {{units of the}} class. Instead of two forward anchors, one on each side, America had no <b>starboard</b> <b>anchor</b> and an additional anchor astern, a change made to accommodate the AN/SQS-23 sonar. America was the only post-World War II U.S. carrier to be built with sonar, though it was removed in the early 1980s. She also had a narrow smokestack compared to prior units.|$|E
60|$|The huge loom of the Frenchman {{was seen}} {{bursting}} through the smoke. Thick clusters of boarders hung upon her sides and shrouds. A final broad-side leapt from her ports, and the main-mast of the Leda, snapping short {{off a few}} feet above the deck, spun {{into the air and}} crashed down upon the port guns, killing ten men and putting the whole battery out of action. An instant later the two ships scraped together, and the <b>starboard</b> bower <b>anchor</b> of the Gloire caught the mizzen-chains of the Leda upon the port side. With a yell the black swarm of boarders steadied themselves for a spring.|$|R
50|$|One of the Blakely pattern 32-pounders {{was found}} lying across the {{starboard}} side of the hull, forward of the boilers. A second Blakely 32-pounder was identified outside the hull structure, immediately forward of the propeller and its lifting frame; the forward 32-pounder was recovered in 2000. Both of the British Royal Navy pattern 32-pounders were identified: One lies inside the starboard hull, forward of the boilers, adjacent to the forward Downton pump. The second was identified as lying on the iron deck structure, immediately aft of the smoke pipe; it was recovered in 2001. The sole remaining 32-pounder has not been positively identified, {{but it could be}} underneath hull debris forward of the <b>starboard</b> Trotman <b>anchor.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The warship {{arrived in}} Pearl Harbor on 21 December. After {{several days in}} port, she began battle {{practice}} training in the Hawaiian operating area. On 3 January 1944, Wintle and [...] came alongside one another to practice fueling at sea. After transferring about 1,000 gallons of fuel to Wintle, Dempsey prepared to leave. Suddenly, she rammed Wintle on her <b>starboard</b> side. Her <b>anchor</b> ripped open Wintle's starboard side from the lower platform deck to the main deck at frame 40. Dempsey's anchor also broke Wintle's degaussing coil and severed her return steam line. In her haste to change course, Dempsey swerved sharply, colliding with Wintle again, this time stern to stern, crushing Wintle's propeller guard against her hull. The damaged destroyer escort's repair party quickly stuffed mattresses into the breach in her hull and shored them up {{as best they could}} to prevent serious flooding. Wintle was able to make 10 knots without shipping too much water and reached Pearl Harbor the following morning to begin repairs. She completed repairs rapidly and returned to sea to resume exercises on 11 January.|$|R
500|$|At 00:58 U-47 fired a salvo {{of three}} torpedoes from its bow tubes, a fourth lodging in its tube. Two {{failed to find}} a target, but a single torpedo struck the bow of Royal Oak at 01:04, shaking the ship and waking the crew. Little visible damage was received, though the <b>starboard</b> <b>anchor</b> chain was severed, {{clattering}} noisily down through its slips. Initially, it was suspected {{that there had been}} an explosion in the ship's forward inflammable store, used to store materials such as kerosene. Mindful of the unexplained explosion that had destroyed [...] in Scapa Flow in 1917, an announcement was made over Royal Oaks tannoy system to check the magazine temperatures, but many sailors returned to their hammocks, unaware that the ship was under attack.|$|E
500|$|The {{ship was}} laid down on 29 January 1912 at Ganz & Company's Danubius yard at Fiume (current-day Rijeka), the only large Hungarian {{shipyard}} in Croatia. Ganz & Company {{was awarded the}} contract to build the battleship {{in return for the}} Hungarian government agreeing to the 1910 and 1911 naval budgets. This involved great expense by the Hungarian government, as the yard had hitherto only built smaller merchant ships for, amongst others, , and therefore had to be itself refitted for the building of larger vessels. However she was renamed [...] by order of the Emperor Franz Joseph before she was launched on 17 January 1914. It was customary for either the Emperor or his heir to be present at the launching of a major warship, but Franz Joseph was too feeble and his heir, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, refused to be there as a consequence of his anti-Hungarian attitudes. Franz Joseph sent a telegram of congratulations that negated the snub offered by his heir. During the launching itself there was an accident when the <b>starboard</b> <b>anchor</b> had to be dropped to prevent the ship from hitting a ship carrying spectators, but the anchor chain had not been shackled to the ship and it struck two dockworkers, killing one and crushing the arm of the other. Her fitting out was delayed by the start of the war, but she was finally commissioned on 13 December 1915.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first human}} remains (some ribs and small wrist bones), found outside the hull, {{were brought to}} the surface on January 3, 1911, by Cuban divers working on the Maine. The top of the {{starboard}} turret was detected some [...] from the wreck in late February after piles being driven into the mud and clay of Havana Harbor struck the object. The turret top was raised on March 12, and a human foot was found adhered to the turret by fire. The ship's <b>starboard</b> <b>anchor</b> (one of six she carried) was raised on March 15.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) {{of a wave}} energy converter (WEC) and evaluates {{the design of a}} WEC mooring system. The research is conducted in support of conceptual development, field test and performance evaluation of WECs as part of the mission of the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center at Oregon State University. The coupled FSI study focuses on the evaluation of predictive capabilities and computational performance of commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and potential flow codes using laboratory model test results. The evaluations of a WEC mooring system focus on analysis of field test data and evaluations of the anchor movability, fatigue design and extreme load of the Ocean Sentinel (OS) test platform mooring system deployed off the Oregon coast. Numerical data using a commercial mooring system simulation code are conducted to supplement time history data for the calculations of anchor pulling force, fatigue damage and extreme load. Specifically, this dissertation can be divided into three parts. In the first part the performances of a finite element explicit Navier-Stokes (NS) solver (LS-DYNA ALE), a finite element implicit NS solver (LS-DYNA ICFD), and a nonlinear potential flow solver (AQWA) in predicting highly nonlinear hydrodynamic responses of a floating point absorber (FPA) under large-amplitude waves are studied. The two NS solvers calculate the coupled FSI including fully nonlinear inviscid and viscous forces. The nonlinear potential flow solver calculates individual inviscid wave force components (a Froud-Krylov force, a radiation force, a diffraction force and a hydrostatic force) and empirical (Morison equation) viscous force. Comparing numerical results to laboratory experimental measurements, the two NS solvers and the nonlinear potential flow solver are found to be capable of providing accurate predictions of the nonlinear motion responses of the FPA. FSI coupling algorithms and computational costs of these three solvers are evaluated. Based on the results of the nonlinear potential flow solver at different wave periods, the individual wave force components and the viscous force are studied quantitatively. The nonlinearity of the restoring force and the Froude-Krylov force are found to be important for the FPA responses in all (heave, surge and pitch) directions; the nonlinearity of the viscous force is found to be important in only the heave and pitch directions. The second part first presents a catenary spread mooring system design of a mobile ocean test berth (MOTB), the Ocean Sentinel (OS) instrumentation buoy, which is developed by the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center (NNMREC) to facilitate ocean test of wave energy converters (WECs). Then the OS mooring design, which is similar to a conventional WEC point absorber mooring system, is evaluated through both field test analysis and quasi-static analysis: the field test analysis is based on the extensive data of the OS positions, mooring tensions on the OS and environmental conditions of waves, wind and current, collected during the 2013 field test of the OS mooring system; the quasi-static analysis is based on the analytical catenary equations of mooring chains. Both global characteristics and survivability characteristics of the mooring system are evaluated: the global characteristics include the influence of the OS excursion to mooring tension, positional distribution of the OS, directional control of the OS and environmental contributions of waves, current and wind to mooring tensions; the survivability characteristics include the anchor movability and strength capacities of mooring. Because anchor movement occurred {{near the end of the}} field test, a systematic procedure of designing a mooring system with adequate anchor holding capacity is developed and applied to design a new OS mooring system. In the third part, first, the accuracies of a fully coupled method based numerical model in predicting the mooring tensions of the OS mooring system and the OS positions are validated by comparing the numerical results to the field data collected during the 2013 OS field test. Then, the anchor movability, fatigue damage and extreme mooring tension of the OS mooring system are investigated using the mooring tensions predicted by the numerical model. The results of the above studies are summarized as follows: (1) The numerical model provides accurate predictions of the mooring tensions and OS positions under harsh environmental conditions; (2) When the OS drifted significantly near the end of the field test, the bow, port and <b>starboard</b> <b>anchors</b> were likely not dragged, dragged significantly and dragged slightly, respectively; (3) The fatigue damages of mooring lines are predicted for environmental conditions from low to high sea states; and (4) The strengths of mooring lines in the original mooring design are adequate compared to the predicted extreme mooring tensions...|$|R
60|$|While I was at Liverpool, a fine {{ship that}} lay near {{us in the}} docks, having got her cargo on board, went to sea, bound for India, with a good breeze; and all her crew felt sure of a prosperous voyage. But in about seven days after, she came back, a most {{distressing}} object to behold. All her starboard side was torn and splintered; her <b>starboard</b> <b>anchor</b> was gone; and {{a great part of}} the starboard bulwarks; while every one of the lower yard-arms had been broken, in the same direction; so that she now carried small and unsightly jury-yards.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} we had breakfast and were at work by daylight. I found a light kedge anchor in the fore-hold, where such things were kept; and with a deal of {{exertion}} got it on deck and into the boat. With a long running-line coiled down in the stem, I rowed well out into our little cove and dropped the anchor into the water. There was no wind, the tide was high, and the schooner floated. Casting off the shore-lines, I kedged her out by main strength (the windlass being broken), till she rode nearly up {{and down to the}} small anchorâtoo small to hold her in any breeze. So I lowered the big <b>starboard</b> <b>anchor,</b> giving plenty of slack; and by afternoon I was at work on the windlass.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the course}} of her operations, she {{weathered}} three typhoons (19 July to 21 July; 1 August to 3 August; 16 September to 18 September) and, after the September [...] "blow", was forced to assume emergency harbor duty, as all of the smaller yard oilers had been driven aground by the fury of the storm. A fourth typhoon struck on 9 October; and Yahara, while riding it out, lost her <b>starboard</b> <b>anchor</b> when its chain parted. The ship dragged her port anchor some three miles while winds in excess of 125 kn lashed Buckner Bay.|$|E
5000|$|Wateree herself, however, {{fell victim}} to typhoon [...] "Louise" [...] when it hit the {{anchorage}} on 9 October.

Her final disposition is unknown.|$|E
50|$|A second tug, James Dunlap {{was hired}} from Dutch Harbor, with the {{intention}} of attaching it to Selendang Ayus stern so it could be turned to face into the wind, allowing it to be towed away from Unalaska Island. However, soon after James Dunlap arrived, the tow-line from Sidney Foss parted at 07:30 on 8 December and the weather made it impossible to re-establish the tow. At 11:15, the ship passed into water shallow enough for its anchors to be used. One anchor was dropped and this halted the ship for around an hour, until the wind worsened and the ship began to drift towards the shore again. The <b>starboard</b> <b>anchor</b> could not be lowered as the port anchor had wrapped around the bow of the ship.
