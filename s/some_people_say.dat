500|$|HIStory {{received}} generally positive reviews. Arguably Jackson's most angry, raw, emotional album, the new {{tracks on}} HIStory revealed a musician worn and torn {{by years of}} superstardom, now reportedly reacting against people who tried to bring him down. This reaction is what <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> ultimately stunted his previous skill at creating cutting edge musical trends, with Jon Pareles of The New York Times writing that [...] "It {{has been a long}} time since Michael Jackson was simply a performer. He's the main asset of his own corporation, which is a profitable subsidiary of Sony". Some reviewers commented on the unusual format of a new studio album being accompanied by a [...] "greatest hits" [...] collection, with Q magazine saying [...] "from the new songs' point of view, it's like taking your dad with you into a fight."

2500|$|<b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> {{the three}} saltires (X's) {{represent}} the three dangers of Old Amsterdam: fire, floods, and the Black Death.

In analogy with this, the black pale in the escutcheon of Amsterdam would refer to the river Amstel. Both the colours and the crosses are also found in the escutcheons of two towns near Amsterdam: the village of Ouder-Amstel {{on the banks of the}} river Amstel to the southeast, and Nieuwer-Amstel (now the suburb Amstelveen) to the southwest. Both villages were also the property of the Persijn family.|$|E

In 1972, Tanaka met with Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China to discuss the normalization of relations between the two countries. Among other matters, they discussed the Senkaku Islands, which would later become a major point of contention between the two countries. Tanaka reportedly asked Zhou [...] "What is your view on the Senkaku Islands? <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> things about them to me," [...] to which Zhou replied [...] "I do not want to talk about it this time.
