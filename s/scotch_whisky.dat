25|$|After the English Malt Tax of 1725, most of Scotland's {{distillation}} {{was either}} shut down or forced underground. <b>Scotch</b> <b>whisky</b> was hidden under altars, in coffins, {{and in any}} available space to avoid the governmental excisemen or revenuers. Scottish distillers, operating out of homemade stills, took to distilling whisky at night when the darkness hid {{the smoke from the}} stills. For this reason, the drink became known as moonshine. At one point, it was estimated that over half of Scotland's whisky output was illegal.|$|E

25|$|In the 1830s, Aeneas Coffey refined {{a design}} {{originally}} created by Robert Stein for continuous stills which produced whisky much {{more efficiently than}} the traditional pot stills. Quickly, merchants began blending the malt whisky with the grain whisky distilled in the continuous stills, making the first blended <b>Scotch</b> <b>whisky.</b> The blended whisky proved quite successful, less expensive to produce than malt with more flavour and character than grain. The combination allowed the single malt producers to expand their operations as the blended whisky was more popular on the international market.|$|E

25|$|On June 13, while {{flying in}} a flight led by his {{squadron}} commander, Major Francis Gabreski, Johnson shot down his first German aircraft (of 10 Staffel, JG 26). The 56th had scored its first confirmed kill just the day before, but had missed {{an opportunity to}} achieve a larger victory. As a result, Johnson and his element leader agreed that the pilot spotting the enemy should immediately attack and be supported by the other, regardless of who was leading. Johnson achieved his kill, over an Fw 190, doing just that, but discovered that his element leader had not covered him as agreed. Johnson was reprimanded by Zemke, Gabreski, and Jerry Johnson for breaking formation when the other pilot denied his concurrence. Even so, the kill was confirmed, {{one of the very}} first among the novice 8th Fighter Command pilots. Johnson received a bottle of <b>Scotch</b> <b>whisky</b> from Major General Carl Spaatz, commanding the 8th Air Force, to mark the occasion.|$|E
25|$|As alchemy {{evolved into}} the science of chemistry, vessels called retorts became used for distillations. Both alembics and retorts are forms of {{glassware}} with long necks pointing to the side at a downward angle which acted as air-cooled condensers to condense the distillate and let it drip downward for collection. Later, copper alembics were invented. Riveted joints were often kept tight by using various mixtures, for instance a dough made of rye flour. These alembics often featured a cooling system around the beak, using cold water for instance, which made the condensation of alcohol more efficient. These were called pot stills. Today, the retorts and pot stills have been largely supplanted by more efficient distillation methods in most industrial processes. However, the pot still is still widely used for the elaboration of some fine alcohols such as cognac, <b>Scotch</b> <b>whisky,</b> Irish whiskey, tequila and some vodkas. Pot stills made of various materials (wood, clay, stainless steel) are also used by bootleggers in various countries. Small pot stills are also sold for the domestic production of flower water or essential oils.|$|E
