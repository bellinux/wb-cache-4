5|$|At {{both state}} and federal realms in Australia, assent is used as the means of {{enforcing}} a referendum that is required. This is done by providing {{that it will not}} be lawful to even <b>submit</b> <b>the</b> law for viceregal assent unless and until it has been approved by the required percentage of the voting populace at a referendum.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, three {{collectors}} {{discovered a}} T206 Wagner that featured Wagner {{in a different}} pose, never seen {{in any of the}} other cards. Although a Library of Congress expert said the paper on the card dated back to 1910, the three men decided to <b>submit</b> <b>the</b> card for a water test, using chemicals to determine the card's authenticity. The card broke apart, and as a result, the card was dismissed as a fake.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, several MV-22s {{received}} {{communications and}} seating modifications {{to support the}} Marine One presidential transport squadron due to {{the urgent need for}} CH-53Es in Afghanistan. On 11 August 2013, two MV-22s from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) made their debut ferrying Secret Service agents, White House staff, and press members from CGAS Cape Cod to Martha's Vineyard during the President's vacation. In May 2010, Boeing announced plans to <b>submit</b> <b>the</b> V-22 for the VXX presidential transport replacement.|$|E

5|$|Stamper {{was working}} as a pianist rather than as a {{songwriter}} at the time the song appeared but never learned how to read or write using traditional music notation thus he would have not been able <b>submit</b> <b>the</b> song for copyright, or produce sheet music to prove his claim.

5|$|The Senate {{freshman}} class of 1910 brought new hope to the reformers. Fourteen of the thirty newly elected senators {{had been elected}} through party primaries, which amounted to popular choice in their states.

The Senate finally joined the House to <b>submit</b> <b>the</b> Seventeenth Amendment to the states for ratification, nearly ninety years after it first was presented to the Senate in 1826.|$|E

5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, {{the castle}} was armed with nine 36-pounder guns, {{supported}} by further artillery batteries placed along the beach. To protect Deal, units of infantry and cavalry, called fencibles, were formed in 1794 by William Pitt the Younger– then both the Prime Minister and the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports– and in 1802 units of bombardiers recruited by Pitt carried out military exercises at the castle. The politician and banker Lord Carrington carried out {{improvements to the}} castle in 1802, apparently as a rival project to his friend Pitt's work at Walmer. According to Samuel Wilberforce, Carrington had hoped to charge {{the cost of the}} work to the Treasury, but when he attempted to <b>submit</b> <b>the</b> claims, they were rejected by Pitt and he had to pay for the improvements himself.|$|E
5|$|If a {{publisher}} {{does not agree}} with the rating that they were assigned, they may edit the game and <b>submit</b> <b>the</b> revised version for a new rating; for example, an initial cut of The Punisher was given an AO rating due to the extremely violent nature of certain scenes contained within the game. To lessen their impact, the developer changed these scenes to be rendered in black and white: the revised cut of the game was re-submitted, and received the M rating. There is also an appeals process, but it has never been used.|$|E

5|$|In early 1980, Singapore lodged {{a formal}} protest with Malaysia in {{response}} to a map published by Malaysia in 1979 claiming Pedra Branca. In 1989 Singapore proposed submitting the dispute to the ICJ. Malaysia agreed to this in 1994. In 1993, Singapore also claimed the nearby islets Middle Rocks and South Ledge. In 1998 the two countries agreed on the text of a Special Agreement that was needed to <b>submit</b> <b>the</b> dispute to the ICJ. The Special Agreement was signed in February 2003, and the ICJ formally notified of the Agreement in July that year. The hearing before the ICJ was held over three weeks in November 2007 under the name Sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge (Malaysia v. Singapore).|$|E
5|$|In order, therefore, to {{establish}} an important point of theory, {{and at the same}} time to prevent American chessplayers from being misled and deceived by the superficial analysis of incompetent British chess editors, whose object in condemning the Steinitz Gambit has obviously been mainly to depreciate the originality of its illustrious inventor, whom they invariably try to drag down to their own miserable level of shallow incompetency and self-conceit, I <b>submit</b> <b>the</b> following variations which at any rate possess the undeniable merit of exposing the hollow analytical twaddle continually published in the two London journals above named.|$|E
5|$|Letters backing John {{arrived from}} the Pope in April, but by then the rebel barons had {{organised}} into a military faction. They congregated at Northampton in May and renounced their feudal ties to John, marching on London, Lincoln, and Exeter. John's efforts to appear moderate and conciliatory had been largely successful, but once the rebels held London, they attracted a fresh wave of defectors from the royalists. The King offered to <b>submit</b> <b>the</b> problem to a committee of arbitration with the Pope as the supreme arbiter, {{but this was not}} attractive to the rebels. Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury, had been working with the rebel barons on their demands, and after the suggestion of papal arbitration failed, John instructed Langton to organise peace talks.|$|E

5|$|Randall spent early December {{in conference}} with Tilden while {{committees}} examined the votes from the disputed states. The counts of the disputed ballots were inconclusive, {{with each of}} the states in question producing two sets of returns: one signed by Democratic officials, the other by Republicans, each claiming victory for their man. By January 1877, with the question still unresolved, Congress and President Grant agreed to <b>submit</b> <b>the</b> matter to a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which would be authorized to determine the fate of the disputed electoral votes.|$|E

In August and September 2003, a playable demonstration was also available at the European Computer Trade Show, the Games Convention, and Nintendo Gamers' Summit. To link in with the game's comic themes, Nintendo organized an official competition between October and November 2003 in which contestants would try to <b>submit</b> <b>the</b> best knock-knock joke to win a Game Boy Advance SP {{and a copy of}} the game. Nintendo employed comedian Kathy Griffin to choose the winner.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} between king and magnates {{was caused by}} dissatisfaction with the influence of foreigners at court, and Henry's high level of taxation. In 1258 Henry was forced to accept the Provisions of Oxford, that essentially left royal government {{in the hands of}} a council of magnates, but this document went through a long series of revocations and reinstatements. In 1263, as the country was on the brink of civil war, the two parties agreed to <b>submit</b> <b>the</b> matter to arbitration by the French king. Louis was a firm believer in the royal prerogative, and decided clearly in favour of Henry.|$|E
