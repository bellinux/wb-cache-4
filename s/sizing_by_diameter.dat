40|$|The {{steadily}} increasing costs of raw materials, of the treated products, {{and of their}} replacement in service, {{as well as the}} steadily shrinking supply of preferred species, prompted a forum at Oregon State University on May 15, 1973 "to encourage the use of western hemlock and western fuss for poles and piles by presenting information on their availability and characteristics and discussing its implications for their utilization. " The forum was attended by 27 representatives from wood preserving plants, utilities, and raw material suppliers, and research personnel from western United States and Canada. This survey of relevant information, prepared for the forum, consists of an annotated bibliography of published and unpublished literature, plus an appendix, which contains a bark key, number of trees of pole and piling <b>size</b> <b>by</b> <b>diameter</b> classes, sapwood depth and bark thickness of selected species <b>by</b> <b>diameter</b> classes, and stress values for poles. The index, which lists the information by subject matter, served as the agenda for the forum. The available quantity of pole- and piling-size trees of western hemlock and western firs (Table 1) shows that these nondurable species are an important potential source of supply. Bark-thickness values indicate that peeling residues will be lower with hemlock than with most of the firs (Table 2). These species are permitted for poles in Standard 05. 1 1972, American National Standards Institute (Table 3), and for piles in Standard D 25 - 70, American Society for Testing and Materials. No standards exist, however, for their preservative treatment by pressure processes. All have deep sapwood (Table 2), which should make them especially well suited for piles and for distribution poles and the smaller transmission pole sizes in which they are available in greatest quantity. As the bark characteristics {{do not appear to be}} sufficiently different to provide a basis for segregating western hemlock and fir logs, and the wood of hemlock is difficult to distinguish from that of the firs without a microscope, standards for poles may have to be revised to include a hem-fir group with the fiber stress value for the firs. Full-length incising appears necessary to insure uniform penetration of preservative in the sapwood of western hemlock and should prove equally desirable for the firs. Deep endpenetration and correspondingly high retentions of preservative could result in excessive treatment of short members...|$|R
30|$|While the Maryland {{devices and}} DTS are {{modeled on the}} Earth’s core, MDE follows in the {{tradition}} of the Riga and Karlsruhe dynamos in being based on a kinematic dynamo (Riga: the Ponomarenko flow (Ponomarenko 1973); Karslruhe: G.O. Roberts flow (Roberts 1972)). While the mean flow of the device approximately models a laminar kinematic dynamo, turbulent fluctuations are always present as well. In the Riga and Karlsruhe dynamos, turbulent fluctuations were limited in <b>size</b> <b>by</b> the <b>diameter</b> of the pipes used in constraining the flow, thus separating the scale of the turbulent eddies from the system size over which the dynamo acts. MDE, on the other hand, has an open geometry like VKS and the Maryland devices where turbulent fluctuations can be present up to the system size. Such a geometry is more astrophysically relevant, since natural bodies generally have unconstrained flows in simply connected regions more akin to those of MDE or VKS than the Riga or Karlsruhe dynamos (see, e.g., Nornberg et al. 2006). The lack of scale separation also means, however, that the predictions of laminar kinematic dynamo theory, while still a potentially helpful guide, are no longer reliable.|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the consensus among informants in the naming of tree species from a high diversity environment, the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (Sete Barras, SP), through a methodological procedure based on standardized stimuli. Seven selected local experts on tree species used for timber and handicrafts were asked to walk individually across the same area of 1. 72 ha and identify and name all the known trees of more than 4 cm DBH (diameter at breast height) using common names. All trees were botanically identified, and their DBH and height were measured. The ecologic salience of tree species, {{expressed in terms of}} abundance, average height and DBH, was tested in relation to the informants' knowledge and species naming. The guided walks resulted on 708 identification events, with common names corresponding to 122 botanical species, or 68 % of all tree species present. Both the reduced abundance and ecological salience of rare species can explain their recognition. The highest concordances in naming a tree were related only to the species abundance and not to their <b>size</b> (given <b>by</b> <b>diameter</b> and height). In some cases, there is no single common name for a botanical species, reflecting the intrinsic variation in local knowledge, which must be considered in ethnobotanical studies, in ecological assessments based on local knowledge, as well as in community-based conservation and management programs...|$|R

40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} tumor <b>size</b> <b>by</b> maximum <b>diameter,</b> ABC/ 2 formula, and planimetry method using thick-slice and thin-slice magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: Maximum diameter and tumor volume calculated using ABC/ 2 formula (V 1) and planimetry method with thick-slice MRI (V 2) and thin-slice MRI (V 3) were examined in 83 meningiomas. Form factor (FF) analysis was performed to assess irregularity of the tumor. V 3 values were considered as real tumor volumes. The accuracy of V 1 and V 2 was evaluated using ratio and difference from V 3. Meningiomas were categorized by tumor locations: skull base (anterior, middle, and posterior) and non-skull base (calvaria and other sites). Results: Correlation between maximum diameter and V 3 was statistically significant (r = 0. 91), but the error was significant in tumors with longer maximum diameters. Correlation between V 1 and V 3 was significant (r = 0. 97). However, V 1 tended to be larger in middle skull base meningiomas or in tumors with low FF values (R 2 = 0. 21). V 2 represented relatively accurate volumes in both groups except {{in the case of}} small meningiomas. When tumors were demonstrated within 3 fractions on thick-slice MRI, the ratio of V 2 to V 3 showed significant variability. Conclusions: Using the ABC/ 2 formula, the volume of meningiomas in the middle skull base or meningiomas with low FF value might be calculated larger than the real tumor volume. The planimetry method with thick-slice MRI demonstrated relatively accurate volumes if the tumor was fractionated in > 4 slices...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports on}} a {{molecular}} dynamics study of aqueous electrolyte solutions confined in hydrophobic nanopores. We examined {{for the first time}} the effect of the size and polarizability of the ions on the structure and dynamics of the confined electrolyte solution by considering the series of sodium halides (NaX with X = F, Cl, Br, and I). We also address the effect of pore <b>size</b> <b>by</b> varying the <b>diameter</b> of the nanochannel. As far as structural properties are concerned, the behavior of the NaF electrolyte solution significantly differs from that of the other sodium halide solutions. Because of their small size, Na and F in NaF are found to be significantly solvated by water. In addition, due to steric and hydrophobic effects [Chandler, D. Nature 2005, 437, 640], Cl, Br, and I tend to be repelled from the regions where the density of water is larger. Ion-specific effects on the dynamics of water and ions are found to be minimized when the electrolyte solution is confined at the nanoscale in comparison to bulk water and the water-air interface. For instance, both the data for water and the ionic species indicate that the ratio of the self-diffusivity for the confined solution to that for the bulk is independent of the nature of the anion F, Cl, Br, and I. Moreover, while the average solvation times for Na in NaF and Na in NaX (X = Cl, Br, I) significantly differ for bulk electrolyte solutions, they turn out to be very similar for the confined solutions. Such a leveling of the dynamical properties of the electrolyte solutions due to confinement is also observed on the pairing of the anions and cations...|$|R
40|$|Premise of the study: Gravitropic {{movements}} are unexpected mechanical processes that could disturb tree design allometries {{derived from the}} physics of nonliving bodies. We investigated whether the scaling law of gravitropic performance (power of - 2 of stem diameter) derived from integrative biomechanical modeling is disturbed by ontogeny or environment, then discuss the silvicultural and dendroecological consequences. Methods: In a beech (Fagus sylvatica) plantation, four plots with different initial planting densities evolved without any intervention for 26 yr. Regular tree inventories and a silvicultural model were used to monitor competition over time in each plot. The radial production of tension wood was quantified using a cross-section of the stems at 1. 30 -m height, and an integrative biomechanical model computed the tree gravitropic performance over time. Key results: All trees developed tension wood over the whole period, with higher amounts at the youngest age, resulting in theoretical lean corrections of ca. 20 - 30 on the first 4 m of the stem over the whole period. The scaling law of gravitropic performance is slightly larger than the power of - 2 of stem diameter. Conclusions: Gravitropic performance in forest ecosystems is mainly limited <b>by</b> <b>size</b> (<b>diameter).</b> Ontogenic acclimation of tension wood formation allows the youngest trees to be more reactive. No additional effect of spacing was found. However, silviculture influences size and, therefore, tree reactivity at a given age. Such results will be helpful for dendroecological approaches that use wood as a marker of environmental disturbances or a trait linked to plant strategies...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{original}} abdominal Excluder (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) endoprosthesis {{has been}} associated with late aneurysm sac expansion over time from transgraft ultrafiltration of serous fluid. This has been treated by relining the graft with original or low-permeability components. We asked whether additional component overlap of the original graft material resulting from proximal or distal extensions placed at the time of initial repair would influence the rate of late aneurysm sac expansion in the absence of endoleak. MethodsComputed tomography (CT) scans from subjects (n = 120) receiving the original endoprosthesis from the Excluder pivotal trial were measured for total distance of original graft overlap (including contralateral gate, proximal extension, or distal extension overlap) based on reformatted CT scans. This was compared to change in aneurysm sac diameter and volume (as measured in independent laboratories) at the latest time point available. Patients were omitted if they were missing CT scan data (n = 10), their graft was explanted for endoleak (n = 2), they underwent an intervention for endoleak and did not have diameters available after their intervention (n = 3), or if they had a continued endoleak that could account for an increase in aneurysm sac diameter (n = 11). This left 27 patients with more overlapping components than the required contralateral limb/gate overlap (mean follow-up time 40. 6 ± 17. 0 months) and 67 patients with required gate overlap (mean follow-up time 46. 2 ± 15. 9 months). ResultsSubjects with increased component overlap (mean overlap 87. 1 mm ± 57. 4 mm) were not protected from aneurysm sac expansion when compared to those with the minimum required gate overlap (mean overlap 31. 2 mm ± 3. 4 mm). There was no association of total distance of overlap with aneurysm sac <b>size</b> change <b>by</b> <b>diameter</b> or volume (r 2 = 0. 00034, P =. 86 for diameter and r 2 = 0. 0019, P =. 68 for volume). Increasing percentage of overlap within the aneurysm sac was likewise not associated with aneurysm sac decrease in diameter (r 2 = 0. 0028, P =. 61). Few patients had large percentages of original graft overlap (mean 26. 2 % ± 14. 1 % for the increased overlap group and 18. 6 % ± 5. 5 % for the required overlap group, P =. 0097). ConclusionPartial graft overlap involving multiple original components from proximal and distal extensions is not protective against aneurysm sac expansion due to transgraft ultrafiltration. This suggests that transgraft ultrafiltration is not impeded by having partial double layers of original material. All patients who received the original Excluder and have late aneurysm sac expansion in the absence of endoleak should have as complete relining as feasible with low permeability components if sac shrinkage is the surrogate goal...|$|R
40|$|Rock {{formations}} in Glutenite reservoirs typically display {{highly variable}} lithology and permeability, low and complex porosity, and significant heterogeneity. It {{is difficult to}} predict the pathway of hydraulic fractures in such rock formations. To capture the complex hydraulic fractures in rock masses, a numerical code called Rock Failure Process Analysis (RFPA 2 D) is introduced. Based {{on the characteristics of}} a typical Glutenite reservoir in China, a series of 2 D numerical simulations on the hydraulic fractures in a small-scale model are conducted. The initiation, propagation and associated stress evolution of the hydraulic fracture during the failure process, which cannot be observed in experimental tests, are numerically simulated. Based on the numerical results, the hydraulic fracturing path and features are illustrated and discussed in detail. The influence of the confining stress ratio, gravel <b>sizes</b> (indicated <b>by</b> the <b>diameter</b> variation), and gravel volume content (VC) on the hydraulic fracturing pattern in a conglomerate specimen are numerically investigated, and the breakdown pressure is quantified as a function of these variables. Five hydraulic fracturing modes are identified: termination, deflection, branching (bifurcation), penetration, and attraction. The propagation trajectory of the primary hydraulic fractures is determined by the maximum and minimum stress ratios, although the fracturing path on local scales is clearly influenced by the presence of gravels in the conglomerate, particularly when the gravels are relatively large. As the stress ratio increases, the fractures typically penetrate through the gravels completely rather than propagating around the gravels, and the breakdown pressure decreases with increasing stress ratio. Furthermore, the breakdown pressure is affected <b>by</b> the <b>size</b> and volume content of the gravel in the conglomerate: as the gravel size and volume content increase, the breakdown pressure increases...|$|R
