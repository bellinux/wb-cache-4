40|$|Similarities {{between the}} <b>Still</b> <b>Face</b> {{procedure}} in early infancy and the Strange Situation at one year {{have been noted}} {{by a number of}} researchers. To date, however, few studies have investigated whether mother and infant behaviour in the <b>Still</b> <b>Face</b> procedure is predictive of later attachment security. The present study tested three hypotheses with respect to relations between mother and infant behaviour in a <b>Still</b> <b>Face</b> procedure at 4 - 5 months and attachment security at 12 months. In an initial lab visit at 4 - 5 months mothers were asked to interact with their infants for 2 minutes (Interactive phase), remain still-faced for 1 minute (<b>Still</b> <b>Face</b> phase), and resume interaction for 2 minutes (Reengagement phase). Mother and infant behaviour was assessed for the frequency and contingency of mother and infant smiles during the Interactive and Reengagement phases and infant social bids to the mother during the <b>Still</b> <b>Face</b> phase. In a follow-up lab visit at 12 months, infants’ security of attachment to their mothers was assessed in the Strange Situation. Contrary to expectations, maternal contingent responsiveness to infant behaviour in either the initial Interactive phase or the Reengagement phase of the <b>Still</b> <b>Face</b> procedure was not correlated with attachment security at 12 months. Similarly, and in contrast to previously published findings, no correlation was found between infant social bids to their mothers during the <b>Still</b> <b>Face</b> phase and later attachment security. In an exploratory analysis of the <b>Still</b> <b>Face</b> procedure data, a number of correlations were found among mother and infant behaviour across phases of the <b>Still</b> <b>Face</b> procedure with respect to the timing and frequency of infant social behaviour in the Reengagement phase. These findings are discussed in relation to theory and previously published research. Suggestions for future research are also discussed...|$|R

25|$|The report {{illustrates}} {{the usefulness of}} the human security approach, particularly its ability to examine the cause of conflicts that explain and justify humanitarian intervention. In addition, it could also act as a paradigm for identifying, prioritizing and resolving large transnational problems, one of the fundamental factors that act as a stimulus for humanitarian intervention in the first place. However, human security <b>still</b> <b>faces</b> difficulties concerning the scope of its applicability, as large problems requiring humanitarian intervention usually are built up from an array of socio-political, cultural and economic problems that may be beyond the limitations of humanitarian projects. On the other hand, successful examples of the use of human security principles within interventions can be found.|$|E

25|$|At present Northern Ireland <b>still</b> <b>faces</b> {{policing}} issues, {{though not}} {{to the extent of}} the Troubles. There are concerns about harassment by police of children aged 14–18 in low socio-economic areas of Northern Ireland which has led to a deep level of mistrust between the youth and the police. Further, Catholics in Northern Ireland find that they are treated differently by police due to the police force being largely Protestant. 48% of Catholics that were surveyed in Northern Ireland reported harassment by the police. Instances of harassment include police officials spitting on individuals or enforcing laws in a discriminatory fashion, for example only to those who are Catholic. The Northern Ireland Police force has moved away from police brutality given the focus on accountability for the past and the significant decrease {{in the use of the}} baton amongst police members (guns are rarely used) however harassment continues to be a key issue for Northern Ireland.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the sector}} <b>still</b> <b>faces</b> major challenges. The {{quality of the}} {{services}} is poor, as evidenced by intermittent water supply in urban areas and limited wastewater treatment. Poor drinking water quality and sanitation lead to major outbreaks of waterborne diseases. major outbreaks of waterborne diseases swept the cities of Faisalabad, Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar in 2006. Estimates indicate that each year, {{more than three million}} Pakistanis become infected with waterborne diseases. In addition, many service providers do not even cover the costs of operation and maintenance due to low tariffs and poor efficiency. Consequently, the service providers strongly depend on government subsidies and external funding. A National Sanitation Policy and a National Drinking Water Policy have been approved in 2006 and 2009 respectively with the objective to improve water and sanitation coverage and quality. However, the level of annual investment (US$4/capita) still remains much below what would be necessary to achieve a significant increase in access and service quality.|$|E

25|$|The Sierra Nevada <b>still</b> <b>faces</b> {{a number}} of issues that {{threaten}} its conservation. Logging occurs on both private and public lands, including controversial clearcut methods and thinning logging on private and public lands. Grazing occurs on private lands as well as on National Forest lands, which include Wilderness areas. Overgrazing can alter hydrologic processes and vegetation composition, remove vegetation that serves as food and habitat for native species, and contribute to sedimentation and pollution in waterways. A recent increase in large wildfires like the Rim Fire in Yosemite National Park and the Stanislaus National Forest and the King Fire on the Eldorado National Forest, has prompted concerns. A 2015 study indicated that the increase in fire risk in California may be attributable to human-induced climate change. A study looking back over 8,000 years found that warmer climate periods experienced severe droughts and more stand-replacing fires and concluded that as climate is such a powerful influence on wildfires, trying to recreate presettlement forest structure is likely impossible in a warmer future.|$|E
25|$|Papantla is {{the heart}} of the Totonacapan region.

The Municipal Palace <b>still</b> <b>faces</b> the main plaza, marked by the classic-style pediment over the main entrance. This building contains two murals: one about the Totonacs by Teodoro Cano Garcia and the other by Xolotl Martinez Hurtado de Mendoza. The construction of the building dates from 1810 although it was destroyed by forces associated with Pancho Villa in 1915. The building was reconstructed in 1929, with remodeling done in 1979 and 1999. The plaza is officially named the Israel C. Téllez Park, which contains grass and a number of trees. In this plaza are weekend events such as the Danzón Fridays as well as live music on Saturday and cultural events on Sundays. On the underside of the kiosk is a mural by Teodoro Cano Garcia which depicts the indigenous concept of creation, as a world with four suns.|$|E
25|$|In April 2014, the Warriors {{began the}} {{purchase}} process for a 12-acre site in Mission Bay, San Francisco, {{to hold a}} new 18,000-seat arena {{which is expected to}} be ready for the 2019-20 NBA season, with construction to begin in early 2016. The sale was finalized in October 2015. The location was selected after an original proposal to construct the arena on Piers 30 and 32, just south of the Bay Bridge, met with vocal opposition due to concerns about traffic, environmental impacts and obstruction of views. The new location, which <b>still</b> <b>faces</b> some vocal opposition in San Francisco, apparently eliminates the need for any voter approval, which would have been required with the original site. Some type of waterfront park is planned across from the projected arena, which will be located at an already-existing Muni T-Third stop. The Central Subway, planned to open in 2018, may provide a direct connection between the new site and the downtown Powell Street Muni/BART station. The Golden State Warriors may consider a concurrent name change, possibly returning to their former name of San Francisco Warriors, although the team's recent success has them reconsidering that decision. On January 27, 2016, it was announced that the Warriors' new arena would be called Chase Center as part of an agreement with JPMorgan Chase.|$|E

This is thought to have killed him; however, when Zoe and Sam leave the room, Den grabs Chrissie's ankle. She responds by hitting him on the head a second time, killing him. Unbeknown to Chrissie, Sam witnesses this, but Chrissie allows Zoe to believe that her blow killed Den. As Chrissie has possession of The Vic following Den's death, Sam blackmails her, threatening to unveil her as Den's killer unless she gives her the pub. When Sam realises that Chrissie is attempting to sell the pub and leave Walford, she begins drinking heavily; she smashes up Den's grave and digs him up, hoping Chrissie will be arrested. The plan backfires; all evidence points to Sam, who is charged with murder and remanded in custody. Phil and Grant return to Walford to secure her release by proving Chrissie killed Den. Chrissie is arrested on a murder charge, while Sam is released from custody; however, she <b>still</b> <b>faces</b> a charge of perverting the course of justice and faces a prison sentence up to four years.
