25|$|The canal was {{relatively}} <b>successful</b> <b>prior</b> {{to the arrival}} of railways. Traffic figures are scarce, but in 1798, 28,571 tons of coal were recorded, of which 40 per cent came from the Little Eaton gangway. By 1803 this had risen to 50,374 tons, with 55 per cent from the gangway. Rather than it just supplying Derby, the company encouraged through trade on the canal, and this contributed to its profitability. Regular dividends were paid to shareholders from 1811, although some had been paid in previous years. Initially, they were close to the 5 per cent promised by the original Act, but reached 12 per cent in 1839. Although this exceeded the amount specified by the Act, it was justified as covering years where the 5 per cent had not been made. Traffic figures for February and March 1839 indicate that the Little Eaton line carried 13,332 tons, the Sandiacre line carried 15,725 tons, and 9,773 tons were carried on the Swarkestone line. This would suggest that the total for the year was around 200,000 tons.|$|E

Jackson believed that Hooker would retreat across the Rappahannock, but Lee assumed that the Union general had invested too much in the campaign to withdraw so precipitously. If the Federal troops were still in position on May 2, Lee would attack them. As they discussed their options, cavalry commander J.E.B.

Although Hooker's left flank was firmly anchored by Meade's V Corps on the Rappahannock, and his center was strongly fortified, his right flank was [...] "in the air." [...] Howard's XI Corps was camped on the Orange Turnpike, extending past Wilderness Church, and was vulnerable to a flanking attack. Investigations of a route to be used to reach the flank identified the proprietor of Catharine Furnace, Charles C.

Lee directed Jackson to make the flanking march, a maneuver similar to the one that had been so <b>successful</b> <b>prior</b> to the Second Battle of Bull Run (Second Manassas). An account by Hotchkiss recalls that Lee asked Jackson how many men he would take on the flanking march and Jackson replied, [...] "my whole command." ...|$|E

However, there were significant areas of redesign, advantages held by the EC145 over its predecessor include possessing a greater range and payload capacity, a considerably increased and uninterrupted cabin area, reduced vibration and noise emissions, and measures to simplify maintenance and minimise operational costs. The noise signature of the EC145 is reportedly 60% lower than that of the BK 117 C1.|$|E

One reason he was so well-liked was his ability to accurately predict what might happen in various game situations, explaining to the audience why the strategy or pitch would be <b>successful</b> <b>prior</b> to the play.

5000|$|The female {{role has}} been {{constructed}} throughout history. Historically in Islamic societies, women's role has been within the home which has limited and created obstacles for female leaders. During {{the time of}} the Prophet Muhammad and throughout the early and per-Islamic period, women were given a great sense of freedom and power. The wives of Prophet Muhammad referred to as the Mothers of the Believers were considered the ideal way for women in Islam to behave. Many of his wives and women within the early Islamic period were widely important in different leadership areas. Khadija bint Khuwaylid was not only economically <b>successful</b> <b>prior</b> to her marriage to Prophet Muhammad, but is also considered the first convert to Islam, aiding the Prophet during the revelations and the tumultuous history of the early Islamic period. His wife Hafsa bint Umar was entrusted with keeping the Qur'an safe, and his wife Aisha bint Abi Bakr led an army in the Battle of the Camel. The Prophet also appointed Umm Waraqa as a female imam of both men and women. The Prophet allowed women to take on these powerful leadership positions, however after his death {{the role of women in}} society became dictated by an onslaught of Hadiths and interpretations of Qur'an verses from a male dominated and patriarchal society. However the role of women in all of Islam is difficult to generalize as there are many different sectors of Islam and different interpretations of Qur'an verses which place the role of women in Islamic societies in different ways. [...] Overall women became regulated to positions within the household, becoming protected through seclusion, with men dictating the major decisions of their lives. Therefore, a separate movement for the rights and freedoms of females in Islam began to stir in the early 20th century. Two major figures who called for the liberation and education of women in Islamic societies were Rifa 'a al-Tahtawi and Qasim Amin. Qasim Amin [...] "is considered the father of women's reform in the Muslim Middle East, challenging societal norms in his book [...] "The Liberation of Women". Amongst these two male leaders were also three Egyptian women Maryam al-Nahhas, Zaynab Fawwaz, and Aisha al-Taymuriyya, who worked for the Islamic feminism movement in the late 19th century. In 1956 Doria Shafik in led a suffrage movement in Egypt. The movement for women as political leaders in modern-day Islamic society was spearheaded by these modern day activists for gender equality. However the progress of this movement varies in different Arab countries and within different sectors of Islam, as new interpretations shape the gender construction for women in Islamic societies.|$|E

The diversity of approaches represented here certainly enriches the practice of function estimation. To best address these different perspectives, we have organized our responses around each of their discussions separately. However, there are some common themes {{that we would like}} to briefly highlight here because we will return to them repeatedly during our rejoinder. Priors For function estimation, priors amount to statements about the smoothness of the underlying function OE. To the extent that subjective elicitation of prior distributions is possible here, formulations in terms of characteristics of OE will be most <b>successful.</b> <b>Priors</b> of convenience developed for generic model selection in regression or other settings may not be appropriate when working with finite-dimensional approximation spaces like splines...|$|R
