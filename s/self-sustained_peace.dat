40|$|While the {{objective}} of peacemaking efforts is the institution of a <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>peace,</b> {{the international community has}} not been able to accomplish this important goal in many war-torn societies around the world. Thus, the challenge to peacemakers is not necessarily the negotiation of a peace agreement, but its implementation in order to re-integrate a divided society and allow former combatants to address contentious issues non-violently. In light of this reality, this doctoral thesis argues that contemporary peace initiatives have not established conditions of <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>peace</b> because the majority of peacemakers have conceive their efforts according to the tenets of the strategic approach to peacemaking. The strategic approach strongly believes that a <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>peace</b> can be achieved through state-building practices. Hence the international community has devoted much of its time and resources to strengthen state structures, strongly arguing that a strong state can integrate society and make negotiated <b>peace</b> agreements <b>self-sustaining.</b> Influenced by Habermasian critical theory, this thesis presents the theoretical foundations of the communicative approach to peacemaking. The communicative approach argues that state-building projects will not integrate society, at least in the short term, but foster more conflicts between contending groups. It places a higher premium on reconciliation efforts, civil society movements, and deliberative forms of democracy. Using the Dayton peace initiative as a case study, the thesis shows the reasons why the Office of the High Representative and other international agencies in Bosnia have been unable to establish a <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>peace.</b> It also critically reviews different 'bottom-up', society-centred peacebuilding programmes practiced in Bosnia since the signing of the peace agreement, exposing both its limitations and potentials. As a result, this doctoral thesis concludes by showing that new peacebuilding strategies must incorporate aspects of both approaches to peacemaking to make <b>peace</b> in Bosnia <b>self-sustaining...</b>|$|R

Moreover, senior U. S. officials referred in spring 2008 to a possible “existential crisis” for NATO, as a result of tensions within the alliance over member countries’ troop-level and mission task commitments to ISAF.

25|$|By and large, the new {{operations}} were successful. In El Salvador and Mozambique, for example, peacekeeping provided ways to achieve <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>peace.</b> Some efforts failed, perhaps {{as the result}} of an overly optimistic assessment of what UN peacekeeping could accomplish. While complex missions in Cambodia and Mozambique were ongoing, the Security Council dispatched peacekeepers to conflict zones like Somalia, where neither ceasefires nor the consent of all the parties in conflict had been secured. These operations did not have the manpower, nor were they supported by the required political will, to implement their mandates. The failures—most notably the 1994 Rwandan Genocide and the 1995 massacre in Srebrenica and Bosnia and Herzegovina—led to a period of retrenchment and self-examination in UN peacekeeping.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} the current peace {{operations}} training and education process is inadequate because it fails to incorporate peacebuilding, defined as: providing a secure environment that allows economic, political, humanitarian, and social development, which are the conditions necessary {{for the establishment of}} a <b>self-sustaining,</b> lasting <b>peace.</b> Absent the training for and conduct of peacebuilding operations (PBO), the military cannot withdraw from an area of operations because the conditions necessary for <b>self-sustaining,</b> lasting <b>peace</b> will not have been established, only conditions that prevent the re- emergence of violence. PBO take place during the period in which the former warring factions and society institutionalize or consolidate peace. Although force may be necessary at times to control violence, the military must rely on other methods and skills in order to continue the peace process towards the eventual objective of a <b>self-sustaining,</b> lasting <b>peace.</b> Leaders and soldiers must be educated and trained in these other methods and provided the tools to determine when to employ these methods and when to use force to achieve missions objectives. This thesis will examine the missions the military may be asked to perform, and the kinds of training and education necessary to prepare the military for these missions.

40|$|Peacebuilding {{has become}} a guiding {{principle}} of international intervention in the periphery since its inclusion in the Agenda for Peace of the United Nations in 1992. The aim of creating the conditions for a <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>peace</b> {{in order to prevent}} a return to armed conflict is, however, far from easy or consensual. The conception of liberal peace proved particularly limited, and inevitably controversial, and the reality of war-torn societies far more complex than anticipated by international actors that today assume activities in the promotion of peace in post-conflict contexts. With a trajectory full of contested successes and some glaring failures, the current model has been the target of harsh criticism and widespread scepticism. This article critically examines the theoretical background and practicalities of peacebuilding, exploring its ambition as well as the weaknesses of the paradigm adopted by the international community since the 1990 s. ...|$|R
40|$|Post-Conflict peace {{building}} is evidently {{not a simple}} process. There are significant limitations and complications {{that need to be}} addressed, including political and resource constraints and also peace building in post-conflict societies is a multi-component process, most important of which is finding lasting political solutions within the framework of nation states. While the term peace {{building is}} relatively new, external assistance for post-war rebuilding goes back to the reconstruction of post– World War II Europe and Japan. What was new in Boutros Boutros-Ghali's formulation, and what caught the world's attention, was a realization {{that the end of the}} Cold War opened new possibilities for international action? The United Nations, individual states and international non- government organizations (INGOs), have become increasingly involved in trying to rebuild peaceful societies in the aftermath of violent Conflict. Post-Conflict peace building encompasses the full range of non-military commitments undertaken by the international community to assist countries to achieve <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>peace</b> and socio- economic development. This article studies one such effort of peace building and sustainable development in a war-torn nation. This paper focuses on the original definition of peace building. More specifically, it examines elements of peace building and interventions by external actors to help war- torn societies not only to avoid a relapse into Conflict, but more importantly, to establish the conditions for sustainable peace...|$|R
40|$|Can {{international}} peacebuilding {{efforts in}} war-torn societies have {{positive influence on}} democratic outcomes at the grassroots level? Does any such influence occur through military channels (e. g., security provision) or civilian channels (e. g., democratic education) ? How do different local settings respond to various activities carried out by outside interveners? A key objective of contemporary peacebuilding interventions is to transform war-torn societies into stable, liberal democratic polities, {{based on the premise}} that democracy is the best way to achieve stable and <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>peace</b> because democracies are more respectful toward their citizens and peaceful toward their neighbors (Barnett 2006). Toward this end, in addition to providing security, international interveners typically undertake a wide range of activities to democratize existing structures both at the macro-level and micro-level. There are important variations in local settings in which peacebuilding activities tend to be carried out. Surprisingly, there have been few systematic efforts to investigate whether and how differences in local settings shape the performance and outcomes of peacebuilding interventions, in particular to ascertain the effectiveness of efforts to promote democratic norms and liberal values at the grassroots level. This dissertation attempts to fill this gap [...] theoretically and empirically. It draws on social science theories to outline specific hypotheses about when and how various activities carried out by outside actors may be effective in promoting liberal democratic outcomes in different local settings. These hypotheses are tested empirically through a nine-month field experiment carried out in 142 villages in postwar Liberia, in partnership with a United Nations peacekeeping mission and two local civil society organizations. Empirical findings reveal that the effects of outside interventions on democratic outcomes at the grassroots level critically depend on context types, but the saliency of local contexts is more pronounced for some outcome areas (e. g., political participation) than others (e. g., social cohesion). Theoretical and policy implications of these results will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies post-conflict peacebuilding in {{relation}} to non-state armed groups, notably insurgencies. Peacebuilding in general refers to long-term policies that have as their end-goal a just and <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>peace.</b> The view taken of peacebuilding here is state-centered: strengthening a legitimate and accountable state {{is the best way}} to protect individuals. The focus is on outside intervention. Also, security is a key concept. The framework advances by 1.) analysing the nature of the problem and the main security threats to peace posed by non-state armed groups, and 2.) examines the current policy-options to these problems, and sees what is effective and what is problematic. The assumption is that there is a common model of peacebuilding, that is not necessarily effective. This is referred to as 'rule-of-thumb peacebuilding. This paper uses literature review as its methods. A number of different types of sources were chosen: theoretical literature on conflicts and peacebuilding including statistical and qualitative research, articles by authoritative experts on each subject, policy handbooks by experts, lessons learned reports, as well as commissioned evaluations. Non-state armed groups are analyzed through their means (capacity) and end-goals. Gangs, organized crime, paramilitary groups, private military companies and insurgencies are examined. While all of these contest the monopoly of violence of the state, only insurgencies pose an existential threat both with respect to its means and end-goals. Yet one of the central findings is that non-state armed groups today have converging interests, and thanks to globalization new weaker but more resilient forms of insurgency emerge relatively easily. These groups can have an interest in the continuation of conflict. Of the different policy-option, I analyze DDR, conflict resolution methods, monitoring, arms control measures, sanctions, counterinsurgency and the pros and cons of interventions in general. Generally, policies could be differentiated between ones that focused on the existing armed group, and ones that focus on changing the environment that enabled them to come about. Key problems found with the commonly applied methods of peacebuilding, or 'rule-of-thumb' peacebuilding, were related to power-sharing arrangements and elections, as well as the attention given to short-term results. Additionally, a longer presence of outside monitoring of the peace process would seem to enhance the sustainability of post-conflict peace. Finally, interventions themselves can also be problematic: they can spread corruption and weaken the connection between the government and the people. Tässä tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan ei-valtiollisia aseistautuneita ryhmiä ja rauhanrakentamista konfliktinjälkeisessä tilanteessa. Rauhanrakentamisella viitataan kaikkeen pitkäkestoiseen toimintaan, jonka ensisijaisena tavoitteena on kestävä ja oikeudenmukainen rauha. Rauhanrakentamista tarkastellaan tässä tutkimuksessa valtiokeskeisesti: oikeudenmukainen valtio, joka on vastuussa kansalaisilleen, takaa parhaiten yksilöiden turvallisuuden. Pääpaino on ulkopuolisten väliintuloissa. Turvallisuus toimii jäsentävänä käsitteenä. Tutkimusasetelma on kaksiosainen: ensiksi pyritään ymmärtämään ongelman luonne ja löytämään keskeiset turvallisuusongelmat ja toiseksi tarkastelemaan käytettyjä toimintamalleja sekä katsomaan mikä on koettu toimivaksi ja mitkä ovat olleet keskeiset ongelmat. Oletuksena on, että on olemassa yleinen rauhanrakentamisen malli, jota käytetään, mutta joka ei välttämättä aina tuota haluttuja tuloksia. Metodologiana toimii kirjallisuuskatsaus. Aineisto koostuu sekä kvantitatiivisista että kvalitatiivisista teoreettisista töistä konflikteista ja rauhanrakentamisesta, eri aiheiden asiantuntijoiden kirjoituksista, kenttäasiantuntijoiden laatimista ohjekirjoista, 'lessons learned' -julkaisuista sekä eri ohjelmien ulkoisista arvioinneista...|$|R
