40|$|Abstract. A phenomenological {{method to}} predict the {{evaporation}} residue cross section in superheavy mass region is presented. It makes us possible to understand what are main contributors to the cros <b>ssection</b> and to perform the systematic analysis for understanding fusion-fission mechanism by finding a deviation from the average property by means of this method...|$|E
40|$|The {{papers in}} this special section {{highlight}} current and emerging research in antennas for WBAN, as well as applications of this technology. This <b>ssection</b> brings together the latest work in antennas for in-, on-, and off-body communication, the WBAN channels, the measurement of wearable and implantable antennas, and also considers the important aspect of specific absorption rate (SAR) estimation and measurement...|$|E
30|$|The {{article is}} {{organized}} as follows: in 'Basic overview' section, {{we present a}} system overview of the localization and the geographic routing. The NLOS effects in the geographic routing are described in 'Geographic routing problems in NLOS environments' <b>sSection.</b> In 'Proposed approach' section, we propose a location estimation and dynamic link detection approach in the geographic routing. The experimental results and performance evaluations are shown in the 'Performance results' section, and we conclude the article in 'Conclusion' section.|$|E
