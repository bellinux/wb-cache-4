40|$|Abstract Background Otosclerosis is {{characterized}} by bony deposits in the otic capsule, resulting in stapes fixation and progressive hearing loss. It can be treated effectively by surgically removing (part of) the stapes {{and replacing it with}} a prosthesis. Increasingly, <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> is performed as a day-case procedure. The major drive towards day-case surgery has been out of economic considerations. However, it is also increasingly an explicit patient request and leads to shorter waiting times for surgery, a reduced risk of infection and most likely positively influences the patient’s quality of life as a result of rapid discharge and rehabilitation. Even though <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> seems well suited to a day-case approach, given the low complication rates and early recovery, evidence is scarce and of low quality. Methods and design A single-center unblinded randomized controlled trial was designed to (primarily) investigate the effect of hearing outcomes of day-case <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> compared to inpatient <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> and (secondarily) investigate the effect of both methods on quality of life, tinnitus, vertigo and cost-effectiveness. One hundred and twelve adult otosclerosis patients who are eligible for <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> will be randomly assigned to either the day-case or inpatient treatment group. The primary and secondary outcome measures will be assessed using pure-tone audiometry (at approximately 2  months and 1  year follow-up), questionnaires (at 3  months and 1  year follow-up) and costs diaries (weekly the first month after which once a month until 1  year follow-up). Discussion/conclusion This trial allows for a comparison between day-case and inpatient <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> to investigate the hypothesis that day-case <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> is associated with a higher quality of life and higher cost-effectiveness, while maintaining equal hearing results, compared to inpatient <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery.</b> Trial registration Netherlands Trial Register (www. trialregister. nl) : NTR 4133, registration date 21 st August 2013...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study is to present a new method for the {{assessment}} of hearing improvement following <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery,</b> taking into account additional, previously omitted evaluation criteria. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective. METHODS: A quartile plot, based on the currently used Glasgow benefit plot, is structured to include two additional criteria of hearing assessment, namely the absence of postoperative sensorineural hearing loss and the closure of the air-bone gap to < 10 dB. Pre- and postoperative hearing results of 132 patients diagnosed with bilateral otosclerosis and treated with bilateral <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> were plotted on both the classical Glasgow benefit plot and the new quartile benefit plot. The difference in success assessment due to stricter assessment criteria is demonstrated. RESULTS: Functional success rate following bilateral <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> as plotted on the traditional Glasgow benefit plot was 51. 5 %. Success rate for bilateral <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> assessed on the new quartile plot with the addition of the two new criteria was 38. 64 %. The difference in success rates was found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The basis of benefit assessment in <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> solely on the mean deficit in air conduction results in overestimation of success rate. This study demonstrates that results that appear satisfactory when judged by the Glasgow benefit plot are of modest success when assessed by the new quartile plot. The quartile benefit plot presented in this paper provides a strict measure of presentation and evaluation of <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> results...|$|E
40|$|Background: Tremor {{plays an}} {{important}} role in microsurgery, especially in <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> because of the minute size and vulnerability of the middle ear structures. The apparent learning curve in <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> suggests better outcomes after more practise. Earlier studies in the otolaryngology field about the effect of microsurgical experience on tremor suggest a trend towards better results in expert groups but the difference did not reach significance level. However, group sizes were small. Because of the declining number of <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> cases and the complexity of <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery,</b> a wide variety of models have been developed to practise the stapes operation. Earlier studies suggest the benefits of these models and also a possible learning curve in stapes models. This study aims to validate whether microsurgical experience and microsurgical practise have beneficial effects on tremor. Methods: 86 subjects were divided in 3 levels of microsurgical experience and their tremor was measured on a tremor model. Differences of tremor outcomes between the 3 levels were analysed. 37 subjects with no microsurgical experienced trained on a stapes model for three times. Tremor measurements before and after training were compared. Results: No differences in tremor outcomes were found between the 3 levels of experience. Microsurgeons with <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> experience did have lower tremor values. Training on a stapes model lowered tremor values down to the same level as experienced stapes surgeons. Conclusions: Microsurgical experience does not seem to be of influence on tremor outcomes. However, experience with <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> does seem to decrease tremor values. Because only 6 surgeons with stapedotomy experience were included it is suggested to measure the tremor of more microsurgeons with stapedotomy experience. Practising on the used stapes model decreases tremor values significantly down to the same level as stapes surgeons. This suggests that the stapes model used is a good tool for practising <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> on. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{object of}} our study was to review the results of 63 {{revision}} <b>stapes</b> <b>surgeries</b> performed from 1978 to 1994. Results: The {{most common cause of}} failure was the displacement of the prosthesis, followed by ossicular chain problems and oval window fibrosis. Postoperative hearing improvement within a 20 -dB air-borne gap was achieved in 58. 7 % of the patients. Hearing gain was closely linked to the operative findings. Better results occurred when prosthesis problems were found. Evaluation of the hearing results by using Glasgow benefit plot gave evidence of symmetric normal hearing in only 40 % of the cases. Conclusions: Prevention of the cause of failure during the primary <b>stapes</b> <b>surgeries,</b> lessening the surgical trauma, seems to provide the most favorable hearing results...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis paper {{describes}} {{the technique of}} low-speed microdrilling during stapedotomy in individuals with otosclerosis. It also evaluates the hearing results and complications using this technique to perform stapedotomy. Material and methodA retrospective study of 45 <b>stapes</b> <b>surgeries</b> performed in the last 6 years was reviewed. The technique was evaluated using audiometric results (air-bone gap closure, pure tone audiogram) {{and the rate of}} complications. The stapedotomy is performed with drilling the posterior crus of the stapes using the microdrill as close to the footplate as possible. The incudostapedial joint is separated with a joint knife, and the supra-structure is down fractured with a right-angled pick. A fenestration is made in the central area of the footplate using the microdrill. In these surgeries, the teflon prosthesis was used.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: : As {{prostheses}} {{and techniques}} related to <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> develop and improve, {{there is a}} need to assess the functional outcomes of the surgery objectively. This study provides a bench test method to assess the functional results of <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> by measuring volume displacement at the round window (RW), which is closely related to pressure propagation of the travelling wave inside the cochlea and thus to hearing. DESIGN: : Motion of the RW membrane in fresh temporal bones was measured using a scanning laser Doppler interferometry system for normal and reconstructed conditions, and the performance of the reconstruction with <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> was quantitatively assessed by comparison of the volume displacements at the RW between the two conditions. To obtain optimal measurements, reflectivity of the laser beam of the scanning laser Doppler interferometry system was improved by retroreflective beads coated onto the surface of the RW, and orientation of the RW membrane relative to the laser beam was obtained using micro-computed tomography imaging. RESULTS: : From measurements in 12 temporal bones, difference in the RW volume displacement between normal ears and ears reconstructed with <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> was approximately 15 dB below 2 kHz and approximately 10 dB above 4 kHz, which was comparable with air-bone gaps in patients after <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery.</b> Two different sizes of the stapes prostheses were also tested (n = 3), and a tendency toward a better outcome with a larger diameter was found. CONCLUSION: : The method developed in this study can be used to assess various prostheses and surgical conditions objectively in controlled laboratory environments. It may also have potential for providing ways to assess other middle- and inner-ear surgeries, and to study other aspects of hearing science...|$|E

40|$|AbstractStapedotomies are perfomed {{with the}} aid of {{surgical}} microscopes. However, the microscope has some limitations and may cause complications such as damage to the chorda tympani nerve. There are just a few cases and no series published on the use of sino-nasal endoscopes in stapedotomies. Objectivesa) To investigate the feasibility of using sino-nasal endoscopes in stapedotomies, focusing on the visualization of important structures. b) To show initial results, discuss possible advantages and disadvantages of this instrument. Methods 15 patients with otosclerosis were selected to undergo stapedotomies in 2010. The data and surgery videos were analyzed retrospectively (study case series). The anatomical conditions of the oval window niche and surgical steps were described and used to assess possible benefits of such procedures. ResultsThe surgeries were performed with endoscopes only and all relevant anatomical structures were visualized without difficulty. No complications were observed and 14 of the 15 patients reported improvement of their hearing, confirmed by postoperative audiological tests. ConclusionTotally endoscopic <b>stapes</b> <b>surgeries</b> are technically feasible, safe and promising. In this small series, the main advantages were: virtually no trauma to the chorda tympani nerve and excellent vision.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} a {{clinical}} investigation of a Dutch family that shows suggestive linkage to OTSC 7. Cross-sectional as well as longitudinal analyses of audiometric data were performed. Also, high-resolution computed tomography (CT) images of the temporal bones from genetically affected family members were obtained to study the incidence and extent of otospongiotic foci. Audiometric data showed a considerable degree of phenotypic variability. Cross-sectional regression analysis did not show age-dependent progression of bone conduction (BC), air conduction (AC), and air-bone gap (ABG) levels. Longitudinal analysis of audiometric follow-up data of one family member showed age-dependent progression of AC, BC, and ABG levels. High-resolution CT images revealed an otospongiotic focus in six of six (100 %) clinically affected individuals that carried the disease haplotype. In none of the clinically unaffected family members that showed linkage to OTSC 7, an otospongiotic focus was detected by CT. In conclusion, hearing impairment in the present otosclerosis family seems to be variable in terms of onset age and level of progression. Long-term audiometric data of one patient proved to be valuable in understanding progression of hearing impairment in this individual. The detection rate of otospongiotic foci in our study group is similar compared to previous reports on CT data in consecutive otosclerosis patients who had <b>stapes</b> replacing <b>surgery...</b>|$|R
40|$|In the {{surgical}} treatment of otosclerosis, the coupling between the stapes prosthesis {{and the long}} process of the incus is critical. After surgery, connective tissue and mucosa may grow over the coupling area and thereby influence the sound transmission properties of the incus-prosthesis interface. It was the hypothesis of this study that tissue ongrowth in the incus-prosthesis interface has little influence on sound transmission following <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery.</b> The goals {{of the study were}} to: (1) investigate the extent of postoperative tissue ongrowth over the stapes prosthesis; (2) objectively evaluate intra- and postoperative sound transmission properties of revision <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> and compare the findings to those from primary surgery; (3) quantify the influence of ongrown tissue on sound transmission after <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery.</b> A group of 10 patients undergoing revision <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> was investigated with audiological evaluations and intraoperative laser Doppler interferometry, and with scanning electron microscopy of the explanted incus with its adherent prosthesis in 6 patients. Results were compared to a group of patients undergoing primary otosclerosis surgery and temporal bone experiments. Results indicated that tissue grows over the prosthesis, as identified in all specimens. Sound transmission properties were evaluated intraoperatively (i. e., incus mobility and prosthesis-fixation quality), and found to correlate well with the functional hearing results. Ongrowing mucosa in the incus-prosthesis interface had only a minimal effect on sound transmission properties and cannot compensate adequately for insufficient prosthesis fixation. Therefore, it is essential that the stapes prosthesis is properly fixed during primary otosclerosis surgery...|$|E
40|$|Objectives : In Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) a {{conductive}} {{hearing loss}} may arise during childhood or young adulthood, which is usually due to an otosclerosis-like pathology involving stapes footplate fixation whether or not in combination with atrophic or fractured crura. Usually the hearing loss evolves to a mixed hearing loss over time. The benefits of <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery,</b> partially or totally replacing the stapes by a prosthesis, have been a controversial matter in the OI population because of the progressive course of the sensorineural component. We present the short- and long-term postoperative audiometric results in {{a new series of}} <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> in OI and compare them with the results from other series in literature. Methods : Surgery reports and preoperative, short-term postoperative and long-term (≥ 12 months) postoperative audiometric results from 34 operated ears originating from 22 Dutch and Belgian OI patients operated at different institutes were obtained retrospectively. A primary stapes operation was performed in 29 ears, and from 5 other ears we obtained the results of revision <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery.</b> Results : At surgery all ears demonstrated fixation of the stapes footplate in the oval window, impeding the normal transmission of sound waves to the inner ear. Additionally, footplates were mentioned thickened or fragile, stapes crura atrophic or fractured, and the middle ear mucosa thickened or hypervascularized. The post-operative audiometric follow-up period ranged from 1 month to 37 years. Postoperative audiometry in the short-term revealed improved hearing and reduced air-bone gaps in 28 out of 29 ears with primary <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> and in all ears with revision surgery after a second revision operation was performed in one ear. In all the 22 ears with long-term postoperative follow-up, which had an average duration of 15 years, a hearing gain was still measurable at the latest audiometric evaluation. Conclusions : Beneficial results are obtained in the majority of OI patients undergoing <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> for the reduction of a {{conductive hearing loss}} component caused by stapes footplate fixation. Despite the progressive course of the concomitant sensorineural hearing loss component, the hearing gain remains beneficial over the years...|$|E

STUDY DESIGN: A clinical investigation of a family linked to OTSC 5, including analyses of audiometric data and of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) images of the temporal bones from genetically affected family members. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Family members from a four-generation pedigree with otosclerosis segregating as an autosomal dominant trait. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Pre-surgery pure tone audiometric data. Classification of otosclerotic foci on high-resolution spiral CT images of the temporal bones of genetically affected individuals. RESULTS: Audiometric data showed a considerable degree of phenotypic variability. Cross-sectional regression analysis did not disclose any clear age dependence of threshold-related data. Systematic differences between mean parameter values relating to the thresholds in the best or the worst ear were found. High-resolution CT images revealed a fenestral otosclerotic focus in seven of nine (78 %) clinically affected individuals and cochlear foci {{in one of these}} seven patients.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the commonest presentation and intraoperative findings and significant post operative challenges {{in patients who}} underwent modified radical mastoidectomy in Melmaruvathur adhiparasakthi Institute of medical sciences and research. Design: Retrospective study. Materials and Methods: Fifty six patients who underwent modified radical mastoidectomy for unsafe ear disease were included in this study. The study period was from 2009 to 2012. The commonest presentation was evaluated with the history taken from the patient′s records. The intraoperative evaluation of primary pathology and its anatomic extension and ossicular status were identified. Common problems we faced postoperatively were documented. Results: Of the 56 patients,thirty eight(68 %) were male and eighteen(32 %) were female. The age ranged from nine years -fifty years of age. The commonest presentation {{in this study was}} foul smelling scanty discharge (75 %) and the primary pathology was isolated cholesteatoma (54 %). The involvement of mesotympanum, attic, aditus & antrum with primary disease was more than the isolated involvement of attic,aditus and antrum. Stapes erosion was more common than incus erosion in our study. We faced a very rare postoperative complication of delayed facial palsy in one patient who had no facial nerve dehiscence. Conclusion: Good attention given to patients with infrequent, minimal ear discharge helps to identify unsafe ear. In unsafe ear, otologists should be well prepared to face the <b>stapes</b> erosion during <b>surgery.</b> Even though rare, otologists should be aware of delayed facial palsy and be cautious about the past history of herpes simplex and varizella infection and consider antiviral prophylaxis before surgery...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Much {{controversy}} exists {{concerning the}} risk of inner ear barotrauma after <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> in scuba and sky divers. Uniform consensus has not been established regarding poststapedectomy barorestrictions. The {{purpose of this study}} was (1) to determine the prevalence of adverse auditory and/or vestibular sequelae in patients after stape-dectomy related to scuba and sky diving, and (2) to offer recommendations on barometric exposure after <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery.</b> STUDY DESIGN: Survey questionnaires were mailed to 2222 patients who had undergone stapedec-tomies at a single tertiary otologic referral center between 1987 and 1998. Two hundred eight of the initial 917 respondents (22. 7 %) had snorkeled, scuba, or sky dived after <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery,</b> and 140 of these responded to a second questionnaire detail-ing dive protocols, otologic symptoms, and their relationship to the diving activities. Of the 140, 28 had scuba or sky dived. Their survey data were analyzed and their medical records were reviewed. RESULTS: Four of the 22 scuba divers (18. 1 %) experi-enced otologic symptoms at the time of diving. These included otalgia on descent (3 / 22; 13. 6 %), tinnitus (1 / 22; 4. 5 %), and transient vertigo on initial submersion (1 / 22; 4. 5 %). One patient had sudden sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo develop 3 months after scuba diving, which he related to noise exposure. He was subsequently found to have a perilymph fistula, which was successfully re-paired. Of the 9 patients who sky dived, 2 patients (22. 2 %) reported otologic symptoms during the dive. No significant diving-related long-term effects indicative of labyrinthine injury were seen in any of the 28 patients.

These activities may be pursued with relative safety after <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery,</b> provided adequate eustachian tube function has been established. (Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 2001...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the audiometric results of primary <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> {{in patients with}} otosclerosis and to determine predictors of a postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) of 10 dB or less and a postoperative gain in air conduction (AC) exceeding 20 dB. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Tertiary referral center in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Patients: Nine hundred thirty-nine patients with otosclerosis who underwent primary <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> between January 1, 1982, and March 1, 2009. Intervention: Primary <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery.</b> Main Outcome Measures: Preoperative and postoperative audiometric results were compared. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate which factors (ie, sex, age at surgery, bilateral otosclerosis, and preoperative 4 -frequency [0. 5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz] ABG, AC, or bone conduction) independently contributed {{to the prediction of}} a postoperative ABG of 10 dB or less and a postoperative gain in AC exceeding 20 dB. Results: A total of 72. 1 % of patients had a postoperative ABG of 10 dB or less, and 93. 8 % of patients had a postoperative ABG of 20 dB or less. Age at surgery and preoperative ABG and AC were independent prognostic determinants. A patient older than 40 years with a preoperative ABG of 30 dB or less has a 77. 6 % chance of achieving a postoperative ABG of 10 dB or less. A patient with a preoperative AC exceeding 50 dB and a preoperative ABG exceeding 30 dB has an 86. 2 % chance of achieving a postoperative gain in AC exceeding 20 dB.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the audiometric results of primary <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> {{in patients with}} otosclerosis and to determine predictors of a postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) of 10 dB or less and a postoperative gain in air conduction (AC) exceeding 20 dB. Retrospective cohort study. Tertiary referral center in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Nine hundred thirty-nine patients with otosclerosis who underwent primary <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> between January 1, 1982, and March 1, 2009. Primary <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery.</b> Preoperative and postoperative audiometric results were compared. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate which factors (ie, sex, age at surgery, bilateral otosclerosis, and preoperative 4 -frequency [0. 5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz] ABG, AC, or bone conduction) independently contributed {{to the prediction of}} a postoperative ABG of 10 dB or less and a postoperative gain in AC exceeding 20 dB. A total of 72. 1 % of patients had a postoperative ABG of 10 dB or less, and 93. 8 % of patients had a postoperative ABG of 20 dB or less. Age at surgery and preoperative ABG and AC were independent prognostic determinants. A patient older than 40 years with a preoperative ABG of 30 dB or less has a 77. 6 % chance of achieving a postoperative ABG of 10 dB or less. A patient with a preoperative AC exceeding 50 dB and a preoperative ABG exceeding 30 dB has an 86. 2 % chance of achieving a postoperative gain in AC exceeding 20 dB. Following primary <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery,</b> a postoperative ABG of 10 dB or less and a postoperative gain in AC exceeding 20 dB may be predicted with accuracies of 62. 1 % and 80. 1 %, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To prospectively {{evaluate}} hearing {{outcomes in}} patients with osteogenesis imperfecta undergoing primary <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> and to isolate prognostic factors for success. STUDY DESIGN: A nonrandomized, open, prospective case series. SETTING: A tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Twenty-five consecutive patients who underwent 32 primary stapedotomies for osteogenesis imperfecta with evidence of stapes fixation and available postoperative pure-tone audiometry. INTERVENTION: Primary stapedotomy with vein graft interposition and reconstruction with a regular Teflon piston or bucket handle-type piston. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Preoperative and postoperative audiometric evaluation using conventional 4 -frequency (0. 5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) audiometry. Air-conduction thresholds, bone-conduction thresholds, and air-bone gap were measured. The overall audiometric results {{as well as the}} results of audiometric evaluation at 3 months and at least 1 year after surgery were used. RESULTS: Overall, postoperative air-bone gap closure to within 10 dB was achieved in 88 % of cases. Mean (standard deviation) gain in air-conduction threshold was 22 (9. 4) dB for the entire case series, and mean (standard deviation) air-bone gap closure was 22 (9. 0) dB. Backward multivariate logistic regression showed that a model with preoperative air-bone gap closure and intraoperatively established incus length accurately predicts success after primary <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery.</b> CONCLUSION: <b>Stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> is a feasible and safe treatment option {{in patients with}} osteogenesis imperfecta. Success is associated with preoperative air-bone gap and intraoperatively established incus length...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} National Quality Registries is {{to monitor}} the outcome of {{healthcare}} given to patients. The Swedish Quality register for otosclerosis surgery {{is one of the}} nine official national registers for ear, nose and throat diseases in Sweden. Since 2004, surgical and audiological results and patient satisfaction scores have been systematically collected from a majority of the ear, nose and throat clinics performing <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> in Sweden. The results of 1688 patients who underwent primary operations for otosclerosis were evaluated for 24 out of totally 26 clinics performing <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery,</b> between 2004 and 2010. The most common surgical technique reported was stapedotomy accomplished in an overnight stay. A majority of patients experienced improved hearing, and were satisfied with the preoperative counselling. Successful surgery, defined as an ABG closure ≤ 10 dB HL, was achieved in 69 %, improvement in AC by ≥ 20 dB in 63 % and BC not worsened by more than ≥ 5 dB in 93 % of the patients. An overall low incidence of postoperative complications was reported. The outcome for ABG and BC was demonstrated to be independent of the number of operations performed by each clinic. An evaluation of the register and the results from the SQOS revealed that <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> is a safe procedure with good hearing outcomes, low complication rates and a high rate of patient’s satisfaction on a national level...|$|E
40|$|Hearing {{loss and}} {{tinnitus}} {{are the main}} symptoms of otosclerosis. Little {{is known about the}} cause of tinnitus in otosclerosis and the factors influencing the effect of surgery on tinnitus. Though by surgery, we are able to inform patient about probable hearing gain and even benefit concerning bilateral hearing, it is however difficult to predict the course of tinnitus. The principle aim of <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> is to restore hearing but some patients also report reduction in the severity of tinnitus and even complete cessation of it. We describe a case report of a 37 year old male who underwent a second <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery.</b> We wish to illustrate that for our patient, tinnitus represents a major disturbance and the patient is as much concerned with the improvement of hearing as with the improvement of tinnitus.

40|$|Objectives. We {{describe}} an unusual case of surgical management of congenital {{mixed hearing loss}} in a female patient with inner ear malformation. This report outlines the role of temporal bone imaging and previous surgical history in evaluating a patient’s risk of perilymph gusher during <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery.</b> Methods. A 68 -year-old female patient {{with a history of}} profound bilateral mixed hearing loss due to ossicular and cochlear malformation presented to our otology clinic. She had undergone multiple unsuccessful previous ear surgeries. Computed tomography revealed bilateral inner ear malformations. She elected to proceed with revision stapedectomy. Results. The patient received modest benefit to hearing, and no operative complications occurred. Conclusions. Although stapedectomy has been shown to improve hearing in patients with stapes fixation, there is risk of perilymph gusher in patients with inner ear abnormalities. Evaluation and counseling of the risk of gusher during <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> should be done on a case-by-case basis...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 years, {{the number of}} stapes {{operations}} performed has decreased steadily. This inadequate exposure to <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> poses problems for both trainees and trainers. We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of stapedotomy performed by a young physician at the ENT Clinic of the “A. Gemelli” Hospital of Rome. We used the technique of “one-shot” CO 2 Laser stapedotomy using a titanium-Teflon piston. For data analysis, we considered the audiograms obtained 24 hours preoperatively and at the last follow-up examination (mean 45 months). Air conduction (AC) and bone conduction (BC) PTA were calculated for 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz thresholds. Air bone gap (ABG) were obtained from ACPTA and BCPTA. Postoperative hearing gain was calculated from the ABG before the operation minus the ABG at late follow-up examination. Analysis of outcomes did not show a clear endpoint for the learning curve; complete closure of the ABG was obtained in {{a large number of}} patients at the beginning followed by patients who showed a higher ABG. Fortunately, we did not observed any “dead ear”. The study supports a learning curve in <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery,</b> but the results can vary widely among surgeries with excellent results followed by others that are not fully satisfactory. <b>Stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> should not {{be one of the first}} ear surgeries performed by a young otologist due to the functional outcome expected by patients and the lack of necessary surgical skills...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to report a series of {{patients}} with far-advanced otosclerosis who were unable to benefit from hearing aids. Among patients with profound hearing loss, it is particularly useful to diagnose far-advanced otosclerosis even if relatively rare, because <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> can improve hearing to a level allowing conventional hearing aid use (sometime the only choice before cochlear implant) ...|$|E
40|$|A stapes gusher is {{the result}} of a {{congenital}} inner ear anomaly showing at tone audiometry a conductive or mixed hearing loss. The conductive part of the hearing loss could lead to the thought to explore the middle ear. The congenital origin should lead to a high resolution. CT-scanning to evaluate a widening of the internal acoustic canal. Repeated audiometry could show especially a large conductive impairment in the lowest frequencies with a closure of the airbone gap at 2 khz and a high sensorineural high frequency loss at 4 and 8 khz. Contralateral stapedial reflexes may be present. Since the x-recessive mixed deafness syndrome (DFN 3) frequently involves males with an early childhood hearing impairment, clinical suspicion should be high. When <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> is considered a precise medical history is essential regarding on the start of the hearing impairment. A continuous suspicion will guide to the audiological, radiological and molecular genetic clues to trace the correct diagnosis before embarking on <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{demonstrate}} different {{techniques in}} manipulating the chorda tympani nerve during endoscopic stapedotomy for otosclerotic patients. Materials: Twenty patients presented with clinically diagnosed otosclerosis {{were randomly selected}} from outpatient ENT clinic in a tertiary referral Hospital over a period of 2  years (2013 – 2015) for endoscopic <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery.</b> Methods: This prospective study demonstrates different management modalities of chorda tympani nerve in endoscopic <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> according to the endoscopic anatomical relationship between the length of the chorda tympani nerve and the degree of scutum overhanging the oval window niche structures (endoscopic scutum- chorda tympani relationship). Results: Three management techniques were carried out to deal with chorda tympani based on its endoscopic anatomical relationship with the scutum (no manipulation, upward-displacement, downward-displacement). All patients had significant improvement of postoperative hearing. Only 2 patients were managed by downward displacement technique had postoperative change in taste sensation and tongue numbness that improved over a period of 6  months. Conclusion: trans-Canal fully endoscopic stapedotomy provides feasible and safe handling of the chorda tympani nerve with best postoperative taste sensation preservation...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Otoacoustic {{emissions}} are low density sounds produced from intact cochlea measureable {{in the presence}} of an intact conduction structure. The goal {{of this study was to}} assess the surgical success rate after <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> by standard audiometric tests, Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission (DPOAE) and Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission (TEOAE) as methods of evaluation of postoperative hearing. Methods: A descriptive-analytic study was conducted on 50 patients with otosclerosis at Yazd Shaheed Sadoughi Medical University from March 2004 till October 2007. TEOAE, DPOAE and other behavioral audiometric tests were performed before, three months and six months after surgery on patients and results were compared. Results: The air-bone gap threshold decreased significantly in audiogram of patients after surgery. Prior to surgery, TEOAE and DPOAE responses were not recordable in any of the patients, but after surgery, they were recordable in only two patients. Conclusion: Although conductive hearing loss improved significantly in patients who underwent successful <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery,</b> OAE tests were recordable in an insignificant number of patients. Therefore, this is not an optimal method for evaluating the surgical success rate...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sensorineural {{hearing loss}} (SNHL) {{is a rare}} {{complication}} of <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> that may arise for many reasons. Usually, the pathogenesis of SNHL can be established by clinical and CT examinations. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the utility of MR imaging when CT findings are normal or not contributive. METHODS: Eleven patients with SNHL (in some instances, associated with vertigo) after stapedectomy, in whom CT showed no well-defined cause, were examined by MR imaging. RESULTS: MR studies established the additional findings of reparative intravestibular gran-uloma (n 5 2), intralabyrinthine hemorrhage (n 5 1), and bacterial labyrinthitis (n 5 1). In five cases, MR findings were similar to CT findings. In two cases, CT and MR results were normal. Revision surgery was performed in five patients and confirmed the MR findings in each case. CONCLUSION: If CT is not contributive as to the origin of SNHL and vertigo occurring after <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery,</b> then MR imaging may be helpful in these patients. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), often associ-ated with vertigo, is a rare complication after stape...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: To {{report the}} {{experience}} of the Jordan University Hospital with respect to the surgical treatment of otosclerosis and to compare results and complications with published studies.   Materials and Methods: The medical records of all patients who underwent <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> for otosclerosis at the Jordan University Hospital during the period January 2003 to December 2010 were reviewed.   Results: Out of 130 patients who underwent <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery,</b> 104 (80 %) fulfilled the criteria and were enrolled in this study. There were 68 (65. 4 %) females and 36 (34. 6 %) males (female-to-male ratio, 1. 9 : 1). The disease was bilateral in 86 (82. 7 %) patients. Family history for otosclerosis was positive in 37 (35. 6 %) patients. Tinnitus was observed at presentation in 82 (78. 8 %) patients and spontaneously resolved or improved in 51 (62. 2 %) patients after surgery. Air bone gap after surgery was ≤ 10 dB in 79 (76. 0 %) patients, between 10 and 20 dB in 10 (9. 6 %) patients, and between 20 and 30 dB in four (3. 8 %) patients. Complications occurred in 17 (16. 3 %) patients, which included: one (1. 0 %) deaf ear, two (2. 0 %) sensorineural hearing loss, two (2. 0 %) facial nerve palsy, six (5. 8 %) vertigo lasting more than 7 days, three (2. 9 %) chorda tympani damage, one (1. 0 %) floating of footplate, and two (2. 0 %) perforation of the tympanic membrane.   Conclusion:  The results of this study are comparable with those reported in the literature by surgeons with the same level of experience, but below than those with large series experience. Therefore, we believe that an experienced general ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgeon can perform <b>stapes</b> <b>surgery</b> safely and successfully {{in the absence of an}} otologist. ...|$|E
