25|$|A more {{economical}} alternative was {{made available to}} the handloader in the 1980s, the copper-plated bullet. Copper-plated bullets are lead bullets that are electroplated with a copper jacket. While thinner than a swaged bullet jacket, the plated jacket is far thicker than normal electroplate, and provides significant structural integrity to the bullet. Since the jacket provides the strength, <b>soft</b> <b>lead</b> can be used, which allows bullets to be swaged or cast into shape before plating. While not strong enough for most rifle cartridges, plated bullets work well in many handgun rounds, with a recommended maximum velocity of 1250ft/s (375m/s). Plated bullets fall between cast and traditional jacketed bullets in price.|$|E

In 1972, the Federal Bureau of Investigation introduced a new [...]38 +P loading that {{became known as the}} [...] "FBI Load".

2500|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>lead</b> bullets are {{generally}} used in handguns with velocities of 1000ft/s (300m/s) or lower, while harder cast bullets may be used, with careful powder selection, in rifles with velocities of 2000ft/s (600m/s) or slightly more. [...] The limit {{is the point}} at which the powder gas temperature and pressure starts to melt the base of the bullet, and leave a thin coating of molten and re-solidified lead in the bore of the guna process called leading the bore. Cast lead bullets may also be fired in full power magnum handgun rounds like the 44 Magnum with the addition of a gas check, which is a thin aluminum, zinc or copper washer or cup that is crimped over a tiny heel on the base of appropriate cast bullets. This provides protection for the base of the bullet, and allows velocities of over 1500ft/s (450m/s) in handguns, with little or no leading of the bore.|$|E
