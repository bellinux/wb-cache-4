5000|$|Marvel's {{editor in}} chief at that time, Joe Quesada, later {{elaborated}} {{on the issue of}} Xorn and Magneto, stating that [...] "Kuan-Yin Xorn came under the influence of as-yet-to-be-revealed entity that forced him to assume the identity of Magneto." [...] However, the issue of Xorn and Magneto was ultimately resolved during [...] "The Collective" [...] arc in New Avengers. A powerless Magneto is attacked by Xorn, who has somehow evolved into a being of pure energy and merged with both an energy absorbing mutant named Michael Pointer and free floating mutant power energy that manifested after Scarlet Witch depowered the bulk of the mutant population. Xorn reveals that he, of his own free will, impersonated Magneto in order to rally mutantkind against humanity but failed due to the quality of his impersonation. He possesses Magneto and briefly reactivates his powers before being defeated by the New Avengers and a cadre of heroes, including Magneto's former son-in-law Vision and Inhuman S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Daisy Johnson. Iron Man, Ms. Marvel, and the Sentry combine their powers and send Xorn into the <b>Sun.</b> Michael <b>Pointer</b> and Magneto are freed as a result, though Magneto is arrested and loaded into a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicopter. The helicopter, however, explodes upon take-off through unknown means as Magneto uses {{what was left of the}} energy provided to him by Xorn to escape.|$|R
5000|$|The 42 meter high, red {{and white}} striped {{concrete}} tower with white steel lantern house was built in 1984. The column has 12 Portholes to river and 2 behind and the lantern house has another 6. It stands in the Elbe, approximately 1,340 meters from the rear light, and is on a circa 30 meters long Platform, stack reached. On {{the base of the}} Tower has a 2 level staircase Deck, which is 5 m high, 2.5 m each floor in a trapezoid Steel frame form section with an Octagon plant design. [...] The tower itself works as a <b>sun</b> clock <b>pointer</b> to the people seating at its shadow side concrete banks around a tree. Inside it has a helix staircase driving to the top. There is not a seating place {{at the top of the}} Platform, only at the bottom, which by high Tide sometimes get washed. At the third floor, it has a door with a plate showing the function of the Structure. However due Graffiti this is covered to see. The concrete foundation was established using a caisson with an average of 5 m inside water different Tide between maximum high and lowest one. It weighs over 700 tons and reaches 10 meters below the water surface. The 11 ton lantern house was assembled with the help of a floating crane. The lighthouse is remotely controlled by the Seemanshöft Pilot Centre and belongs to the Hamburg Port Authority.|$|R
40|$|Three {{systems for}} the {{generation}} of lunar motion The Ms. 2621 Salamanca contains the sketches and the short descriptions {{for the construction of}} three geared systems for lunar motion. They present a much better approximation and are much nearer to the exact periods of the moon than is the case in the known moonboxes. This is realized by very economical gear-trains. In the first system the zodiac disc rotates in the sidereal period, a small <b>sun</b> on a <b>pointer</b> rotates in the synodal moon-period. Consequently the sun moves in 1 year around the zodiac. The letter-wheel with 28 letters rotates in 28 days. The day of the week is shown thorough a window. The drawing hints at a window showing the waxing and waning of the moon. Although not in the description this would be easy to realize by an extra wheel. In the second system the zodiac wheel rotates in 365 days. Here is a letter-wheel with 21 letters rotating in three weeks. A pointer fastened on wheel 45 rotates in the synodic period of the moon. A small wheel on the same axis drives a wheel with a double module, the latter shows the 'waxing and waning' of the moon through an aperture. In the third system the prime mover is a small wheel with 6 teeth rotating in 24 hours. On its axis a pointer is attached passing along the 24 hourmarkings on the limbus. The zodiac rotates in 365. 20 days. The moon-pointer rotates in the synodic period of the moon. This system can easily be completed with a letter-wheel showing the weekdays and a wheel which shows the 'waxing and waning' of the moon. These three systems are placed in the Ms. between a description of the construction of an astrolabe and the descriptions and sketches of several kinds of sundials. It is possible that these mechanisms were meant as an extra dial in monumental astronomical clock-works...|$|R

50|$|On {{the other}} side of the tower there is another great clock face above the arch, visible to people walking down the street towards the Piazza. This is a simpler affair, again {{surrounded}} by a marble circle marked with the 24 hours, but in two series of 12 hours each.

50|$|Below this is {{the great}} clock face in blue and gold inside a fixed circle of marble {{engraved}} with the 24 {{hours of the day}} in Roman numerals. A golden pointer with an image of the sun moves round this circle and indicates the hour of the day. Within the marble circle beneath the <b>sun</b> <b>pointer</b> are the signs of the zodiac in gold (these are original and date from the 1490s), which revolve slightly more slowly than the pointer to show the position of the sun in the zodiac. In the middle of the clockface is the earth (in the centre) and the moon, which revolves to show its phases, surrounded by stars which are fixed in position. The background is of blue enamel. The smaller blue circles in the four corners are not now used.|$|E
5000|$|It is very {{probable}} {{that there were}} planetary dials, as the complicated motions and periodicities of all planets are mentioned in the manual of the mechanism. The exact position and mechanisms for the gears of the planets is not known. There is no coaxial system but only for the moon.

40|$|Three heliophysics {{missions}} [...] the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), and the Global Geoscience WIND [...] {{have been}} orbiting the Sun-Earth interior libration point L 1 continuously since 1997, 1996, and 2004, respectively. ACE and WIND (both NASA missions) and SOHO (an ESA-NASA joint mission) are all operated from the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). While ACE and SOHO have been dedicated libration point orbiters since their launches, WIND has had also a remarkable 10 -year career flying a deep-space, multiple lunar-flyby trajectory prior to 2004. That era featured 36 targeted lunar flybys with excursions to both L 1 and L 2 before its final insertion in L 1 orbit. A figure depicts {{the orbits of}} the three spacecraft, showing projections of the orbits onto the orthographic planes of a solar rotating ecliptic frame of reference. The SOHO orbit is a quasi-periodic halo orbit, where the frequencies of the in-plane and out-of-plane motions are practically equal. Such an orbit is seen to repeat itself with a period of approximately 178 days. For ACE and WIND, the frequencies of the in-plane and out-of-plane motions are unequal, giving rise to the characteristic Lissajous motion. ACE's orbit is of moderately small amplitude, whereas WIND's orbit is a large-amplitude Lissajous of dimensions close {{to those of the}} SOHO halo orbit. As motion about the collinear points is inherently unstable, stationkeeping maneuvers are necessary to prevent orbital decay and eventual escape from the L 1 region. Though the three spacecraft are dissimilar (SOHO is a 3 -axis stabilized <b>Sun</b> <b>pointer,</b> WIND is a spin-stabilized ecliptic pole pointer, and ACE is also spin-stabilized with its spin axis maintained between 4 and 20 degrees of the Sun), the stationkeeping technique for the three is fundamentally the same. The technique consists of correcting the energy of the orbit via a delta-V directed parallel or anti-parallel to the Spacecraft-to-Sun line. SOHO achieves this using thrusters oriented in line with the solar direction. WIND achieves the delta-V via pulsing radial thrusters when aligned with the Sun. ACE uses axial thrusters to apply delta-V with a component that is 94 % or more aligned with the ACE-Sun line. Sunward thrust adds energy to the orbit preventing decay back toward Earth. Thrust directed anti-Sunward takes energy out of the L 1 orbit, thereby preventing escape from the Earth-Moon system into independent heliocentric orbit. Libration point orbit stationkeeping delta-V costs grow exponentially with time elapsed from the last maneuver performed. The doubling time constant is approximately 16 days. For the sake of fuel conservation, and for limiting the absolute magnitude of propulsion performance errors, stationkeeping maneuvers should be performed before the delta-V grows too large; for our purposes 'too large' is considered to be greater than 0. 5 m/sec. In practice, the typical interval between burns for this trio is about three months, and the typical delta-V is much smaller than 0. 5 m/sec. Typical annual stationkeeping costs have been around 1. 0 m/sec for ACE and WIND, and much less than that for SOHO. All three spacecraft have ample fuel remaining; barring contingencies all three could, in principle, be maintained at L 1 for decades to come. This paper will review the L 1 orbits and the mission history of ACE, WIND, and SOHO, and describe the stationkeeping techniques and orbit maneuver experience. The Lissajous phase control that was practiced for ACE during the period from 1999 to 2001 will also be briefly discussed. The final section will consider the future of these ongoing missions...|$|E
