5|$|The Tjele helmet {{fragment}} is a Viking Age {{fragment of}} iron and bronze, originally comprising the eyebrows and noseguard of a helmet. It was discovered in 1850 with a large assortment of smith's tools in Denmark, and though the find {{was sent to the}} National Museum of Denmark, for 134 years the fragment was mistaken for a <b>saddle</b> <b>mount.</b> In 1984 it was properly identified by an assistant keeper at the museum as the remainder of one of only five known helmets from the Viking era.|$|E

50|$|While {{the well}} {{standardized}} picatinny rail mount (and its less standardized predecessor the Weaver rail) is most {{known in the}} U.S., many European gun manufacturers offer proprietary scope base receiver mounting systems for their guns, for example Sako has tapered dovetails, Tikka use a 16 mm dovetail, {{and there are other}} solutions such as the Blaser <b>Saddle</b> <b>Mount</b> or Recknagel Swing Mount. Dovetail mounts are today mostly found on light recoiling air guns, but can also be found on some modern rifles for hunting and sport shooting using smokeless powder, although other options such as the picatinny rail are becoming more popular.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the decade}} before her retirement, Munksgaard also {{identified}} the Tjele helmet fragment as {{the remainder of}} a Viking Age helmet. Discovered in 1850 amidst the tools of a metalsmith, it was mistaken for a <b>saddle</b> <b>mount.</b> The fragment led an [...] "unnoticed existence" [...] in the museum for the next 130 years; recognising {{it for what it}} actually was in 1984, Munksgaard noted that [...] "it is quite true that the best finds are often made not in the field, but in the museums." [...] The fragment is now identified as the remainder of one of only five known Viking helmets.|$|E

5000|$|Munksgaard's work {{encompassed}} multiple {{aspects of}} prehistoric Denmark. In 1974 she published the work Oldtidsdragter, for decades the authoritative work on ancient Scandinavian clothing. Over time her ideas developed {{to suggest a}} particular style of dress for the eleventh century King Canute, an idea so central to her scholarship that the [...] "finale" [...] to her career was the installation in the museum of {{a replica of the}} king. In 1984 Munksgaard furthermore identified the Tjele helmet fragment as the remnant of one of the only known Viking helmets, rather than the <b>saddle</b> <b>mount</b> it had been misidentified as for 130 years.|$|E
50|$|Sanur {{is located}} in the {{highlands}} of the northern West Bank. The village is situated on an isolated hilltop along {{the western edge of the}} valley and seasonal lake of Marj Sanur, which is named after the village. To the west, Sanur is connected to the Hawarah Ridge of the Zawiya Highlands through a low-lying <b>saddle.</b> <b>Mount</b> Hureish, the tallest peak in the vicinity, is to the south. Part of the village is built on the descent toward the natural boundaries of the Marj Sanur valley. The old core of Sanur is on the hilltop and is mostly enclosed by walls that form part of the ruins of Sanur's former fortress. In 1979, the built-up areas of Sanur amounted to around 60 dunams. The average elevation of the village is 420 meters above sea level and it is about 45 meters higher than its immediate surrounding.|$|E

25|$|The {{frame is}} a single tube {{following}} the circumference of the front wheel, then diverting to a trailing wheel. A mounting peg is above the rear wheel. The front wheel is in a rigid fork with little if any trail. A spoon brake is usually fitted on the fork crown, operated by a lever {{from one of the}} handlebars. The bars are usually mustache shaped, dropping from the level of the headset. The <b>saddle</b> <b>mounts</b> on the frame less than 50cm (18in) behind the headset.|$|R

500|$|For {{the scene}} in which the Doctor, Amy, and River are riding on horses, the close-ups of the {{characters}} riding were filmed by having the actors sit on a <b>saddle</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the back of}} a truck and act like they were riding horses. Gillan called this the [...] "strangest thing" [...] she had ever done, and was sure she [...] "looked ridiculous". They were filmed performing this as the truck drove to achieve the effect of the passing country. Wide shots were taken of stunt doubles of the three actors riding real horses. This scene was filmed on 1 February 2010.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{independent}} axis {{dynamics of}} machine tools that employ long slender lead screws, bearings, and workpiece <b>saddles,</b> <b>mounted</b> on supporting slides, will be considered. Distributed-lumped parameter techniques {{will be used}} for system analysis and in the model formulation procedures. Realizations that encompass combined torsional and tension loading will be incorporated. Specific, integrated, distributed-lumped machine tool configurations will be derived and described in block diagram form. Simulation studies illustrating the dynamic signature of a machine tool axis drive, when operated at various feed rates, together with the measured results will be presented. The effect of changes in the effective lead-screw length on the workpiece surface finish will be commented on...|$|R
6000|$|It was Chauncey Dike, {{and he had}} won {{the race}} for the bottle of [...] "Black Betty,"--Chauncey Dike, his long, black hair shining with bear's oil. Amid the cheers of the bride's friends he leaped from his <b>saddle,</b> <b>mounted</b> a stump and, {{flapping}} his arms, crowed in victory. Before he had done the vanguard of the groom's friends were upon us, pell-mell, all in the finest of backwoods regalia,--new hunting shirts, trimmed with bits of color, and all armed to the teeth--scalping knife, tomahawk, and all. Nor had Chauncey Dike forgotten the scalp of the brave who leaped at him out of the briers at Neowee.|$|R

5000|$|The Republic of Texas {{had been}} the major {{purchaser}} of the early Paterson Holster Pistol (No. 5 model), a five shot cal [...]36 revolver, and Samuel Walker became familiar with it during his service as a Texas Ranger. In 1847, Walker was engaged in the Mexican-American War as a captain in the United States Mounted Rifles. He approached Colt, requesting a large revolver to replace the single-shot Aston Johnson holster pistols then in use. The desired [...]44-.45 caliber revolver would be carried in <b>saddle</b> <b>mounted</b> holsters and would {{be large enough to}} dispatch horses as well as enemy soldiers. The Colt Walker was used in the Mexican-American War and on the Texas frontier.|$|R
