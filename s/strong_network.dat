40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the use of}} the inherent structural characteristics of power system networks for improving the reac-tive power reserve margins for both topologically weak and <b>strong</b> <b>networks.</b> The inherent structural characteristics of the network are derived from the Schur complement of the partitioned Y-admittance matrix using circuit theory repre-sentations. Results show that topologically <b>strong</b> <b>networks,</b> operating close to the upper voltage limit could be made to increase their loadability margin by locating reactive power compensators close to generator sources, whereas topo-logically weak (ill conditioned) networks could be made to operate within the feasible operating limits by locating reac-tive power compensators on buses farther from generator sources...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{influence}} of social networks on job search behavior of unemployed individuals. Standard theory suggests that people with <b>strong</b> <b>networks</b> utilize informal channels more often and—since the low search costs increase the value of unemployment—set higher reservation wages. We use the IZA Evaluation Dataset—an extensive novel data set con-taining information on 18, 000 individuals interviewed shortly after entering unemployment—to test these hypotheses. The empirical findings underscore the established importance of networks on job search behavior. Individuals with <b>strong</b> <b>networks</b> set a higher reservation wage, use informal more often and sent out more applications. In terms of expectation, {{they also have a}} more optimistic outlook than people with weak networks...|$|R

25|$|During the Great Irish Famine (1845–1851), Irish {{families}} {{were forced to}} emigrate from Ireland; by 1854, between 1,500,000 and 2,000,000 people were forced {{to leave the country}} - {{about a quarter of the}} pre-famine population. In the United States, most of the recently arrived Irish became city dwellers as that was where work was. In addition, arriving with little money, many settled in the cities at which their ships made port. By 1850, the Irish made up a quarter of the population in Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. Their arrival in the United States before other waves of Catholic immigrants meant that ethnic Irish long dominated the Roman Catholic Church in America. They created a <b>strong</b> <b>network</b> of churches and parochial schools to support their communities.|$|E
25|$|He {{worked to}} {{maintain}} a <b>strong</b> <b>network</b> of contacts among anti-fascist intellectuals throughout Italy, {{while much of the}} Italian academic world bowed to the regime. With his former students and followers Ernesto Rossi and Carlo Rosselli he founded the first clandestine anti-fascist newspaper Non mollare (Don't Give Up) in January 1925. A half year later he was arrested and put on trial, but was released on a technicality, although he was kept under surveillance. Threats against his life were published in the Fascist press and his lawyer was beaten to death by Fascist blackshirts. His name was on top of the list of the Fascist death squads during raids on 4 October 1925 in Florence. However, Salvemini had fled to France in August 1925. He was dismissed from the University of Florence and his Italian citizenship was revoked in 1926.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Buna–Gona {{was part}} of the New Guinea {{campaign}} in the Pacific Theatre during World War II. It followed the conclusion of the Kokoda Track campaign and lasted from 16 November 1942 until 22 January 1943. The battle was conducted by Australian and United States forces against the Japanese beachheads at Buna, Sanananda and Gona. From these, the Japanese had launched an overland attack on Port Moresby. In light of developments in the Solomon Islands campaign, Japanese forces approaching Port Moresby were ordered to withdraw to and secure these bases on the northern coast. Australian forces maintained contact as the Japanese conducted a well-ordered rearguard action. The Allied objective was to eject the Japanese forces from these positions and deny them their further use. The Japanese forces were skillful, well prepared and resolute in their defence. They had developed a <b>strong</b> <b>network</b> of well-concealed defences.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{potential}} physiological mechanisms linking loneliness to poor health outcomes. In 2005, results from the American Framingham Heart Study demonstrated that lonely men had raised levels of Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a blood chemical linked to heart disease. A 2006 study conducted by the Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience at the University of Chicago found loneliness can add thirty points to a blood pressure reading for adults over the age of fifty. Another finding, from a survey conducted by John Cacioppo from the University of Chicago, is that doctors report providing better medical care to patients who have a <b>strong</b> <b>network</b> of family and friends than they do to patients who are alone. Cacioppo states that loneliness impairs cognition and willpower, alters DNA transcription in immune cells, and leads over time to high blood pressure. Lonelier {{people are more likely to}} show evidence of viral reactivation than less lonely people. Lonelier people also have stronger inflammatory responses to acute stress compared with less lonely people; inflammation is a well known risk factor for age-related diseases.|$|E
25|$|On April 28, 1985, Continental inaugurated {{its first}} {{scheduled}} service to Europe with flights from Houston to London/Gatwick. Additional service from Newark to London and Paris started after the airline's merger with People Express Airlines in 1987. However, the airline was still facing significant challenges with consistently low reliability rankings {{and a high}} level of customer complaints compared with its competitors. In October 1985, Texas Air Corp. made an offer for a Denver-based regional carrier, Frontier Airlines, opening a bidding war with People Express, which was headed by Lorenzo's former TI associate Don Burr. People Express paid a substantial premium for Frontier's high-cost operation. The acquisition, funded by debt, did not seem rational to industry observers from either the route integration or the operating philosophy points of view, but was in the opinion of most industry analysts rather an attempt by Burr to best his former boss, Lorenzo. On August 24, 1986, Frontier filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations. With People Express hemorrhaging cash, Texas Air acquired People Express on September 15, 1986, at the same time gaining Frontier, whose <b>strong</b> <b>network</b> in the Great Plains and intermountain West reinforced Continental's already formidable Denver hub. Because it had been the largest airline operating in the New York market, the People Express hub at Newark would permit Continental to expand its East Coast services dramatically. Continental soon became the third-largest airline in the U.S. and the predominant force in the New York, Denver and Houston airline markets.|$|E
