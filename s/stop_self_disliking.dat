40|$|Aim: To {{consider}} how the older person constructs the experience of cancer pain and how this is informed by expectations and experiences. Method: Nine older people with cancer were asked to keep diaries and subsequently interviewed about their experiences of living with cancer and pain. Findings: Five themes were identified - better to be old than to be dying with cancer, maintaining control and independence, loss of identity in adapting and grieving for a former <b>self,</b> <b>dislike</b> of analgesia and denial of pain. The themes give a perspective on the embodied meaning of 'pain' in daily life. Conclusion: Clinical pain assessment alone, without listening to people's pain stories, does not always identify pain or problems with daily living. Appreciation of the individuality of the lived experience of cancer can advance our understanding of pain and end of life care...|$|R

The Shadow in the Rose Garden by D. H. Lawrence unfolds its plot with a "secret" {{affecting}} a young honeymoon couple. At first, {{the wife}} {{was able to}} keep the secert from her husband, supported by her psychological superiority complex, which makes him anxious, hateful and angry. As the story develops, the unexpected emergence of her past lover in the Rose Garden, her sweet memorial place, leads to serious consequences.

Shocked not only by her last love affair but the fact of her past lover 2 ̆ 7 s madness, he can 2 ̆ 7 t help her <b>stop</b> her <b>self</b> dissolution. The process of how the secret comes into the open described effectively from its suggestion to its leakage is by Lawrence 2 ̆ 7 s skillful construction of the story and his use of a light touch. Especially his description of the wife without using a proper noun represents Lawrence 2 ̆ 7 s intention to give generality to her secret. As a result, the "shadow" of the madman has the effect of exposing the madness itself to the light of day. It may be concluded that the "shadow" is a metaphor for the madness within ourselves. With such a meaning, The Shadow in the Rose Garden can be considered as a very symbolical story of high quality...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to see whether the offer and prescription of nicotine chewing gum would enhance the efficacy of general practitioners' advice to stop smoking. A sample of 1938 cigarette smokers who attended the surgeries of 34 general practitioners in six group practices were assigned by week of attendance (in a balanced design) to one of three groups: (a) non-intervention controls, (b) advice plus booklet, and (c) advice plus booklet plus the offer of nicotine gum. Follow up was done after four months and one year. The results show a clear advantage for those offered the nicotine gum (p less than 0. 001). After correction for those who refused or failed chemical validation and those who switched from cigarettes to a pipe or cigars, the proportions who were abstinent at four months and still abstinent at one year were 3. 9 %, 4. 1 %, and 8. 8 % in the three groups, respectively. These percentages are based on all cigarette smokers who attended the surgeries including those who did not wish to stop and those in the gum group who did not try the gum (47 %). The effect of the offer and prescription of gum was to motivate more smokers to try to stop, to increase the success rate among those who tried, and to reduce the relapse rate of those who <b>stopped.</b> The <b>self</b> selected subgroup of 8 % who used more than one box of 105 pieces of gum achieved a success rate of 24 %. It would be feasible and effective for general practitioners to include the offer of nicotine gum and brief instructions on its use as part of a minimal intervention routine with all cigarette smokers. A general practitioner who adopts such a routine with similar success could expect to achieve about 35 - 40 long term ex-smokers a year and so save the lives of about 10 of them. If replicated by all general practitioners throughout the country the yield of ex-smokers would be about one million a year...|$|R

Realizing this was a mistake, they decide they must {{go back in time}} and prevent the creation of the coathanger such that their future selves would {{have never been able to}} teleport them to the fake alien craft. After discovering the time device their future selves used, they spend two weeks (relative to themselves) travelling through time to attempt to correct their error, but instead find themselves having made things worse, as in 1945, Adolf Hitler has come to rule the world with his army of anthropomorphic dinosaurs due to the power of the Golden Coathanger. Hitler captures the two and takes the time device away, using it to further assure his power but further damaging the time stream. Ben and Dan work through the time paradoxes in order to defeat Hitler and recover the time device. Realizing now that preventing the creation of the coathanger is disastrous, the two go back in time and <b>stop</b> their earlier <b>selves</b> before the coathanger is invented.

He suffered from visions of a world eaten up by the Cancer God M'Nagalah, and knew that Pyotr Konstantin somehow caused it. In the dead of night E broke into the homes of Russian immigrants in an attempt to find Pyotr, and threatened them with his hammer and stakes. E's nighttime activities made the news, and John Constantine knew it had to be E, so he summoned the other members of the Trenchcoat Brigade to have a chat with him. E took the Trenchcoat Brigade on a trip to the possible future of his vision, where the only person left alive was Pyotr. E staked Pyotr through the chest, but it didn't kill him, and Pyotr summoned the Whining Ones to attack the Brigade. The Brigade won the fight and Pyotr told them they could avert the tragedy he caused if they took him back in time to the 17th century, so E complied. In the past Pyotr cast a spell to force the Brigade to confront and deal with each other's past failures and guilt while he set off to prevent his past self from setting off the chain of events that unleashed M'nagalah.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to reflect}} on technologies of the self, a term coined by Michel Foucault to study western practices of self-formation. Influenced by his work on subjectivity and by Science and Technology Studies (STS), I explore two forms of meditation – Vipassana meditation {{in the tradition of}} S. N. Goenka and Thich Nhat Hanh’s practices of mindfulness – in order to analyze the entanglements between technologies, associations and subjectivity. Two research questions guided this study. First, how do Vipassana and Zen assemblages bring forth subjective transformations? Second, what are the politics of meditation practice, considering that Vipassana and Zen perform particular paradigms of subjectivity and aim at transforming the “social”? In order to address these questions, I relied on qualitative research methods, developing a multifaceted methodology that included participant observation at four meditation retreats, semi-structured interviews with meditators, the analysis of relevant literature and my own personal experiences as a beginner. I argue that the mechanisms of subjectification employed by meditation rely on two main devices: the transformation of habitual webs of associations, including couplings between selves, other humans, nonhumans and spaces and the installation of new automatisms. Vipassana and Zen technologies invite subjects to become aware of particular automatisms – regular ways of eating, sitting, walking and breathing - and to direct their attention towards them in novel ways, installing specific ways of managing their <b>selves</b> (<b>stopping</b> and breathing whenever they hear the sounds of bells; developing an attitude of equanimity when they are looking for sensations in their bodies). Vipassana and Zen are mediators that generate new experiences and ways of being informed by meditation, {{as well as a number}} of social applications that rely on the paradigmatic changes enacted by these practices. Informed by the dualism between modern and nonmodern, I argue that Zen and Vipassana can be understood as technologies of the nonmodern self (Pickering, 3 2010), suspending the dualism between body and mind, self and others, humans and nonhumans, contributing towards the establishment of nondual paradigms of selfhood and innovative forms of social organization that include new ways of performing human reformation, social action and humanenvironment couplings. The theoretical contributions of this dissertation are threefold. First, I want to extend current STS scholarly work on the self. Second, I want to contribute towards a post-humanist understanding of meditation assemblages. Finally, I am informed by Michel Foucault’s insights on technologies of the self to study meditation, but instead of focusing on the history or genealogy of the western self, I analyze a number of devices of subjectification mobilized to operate subjective changes and to transform the social.
