5|$|The {{equipment}} {{required for}} the {{gas tungsten arc welding}} operation includes a welding torch utilizing a non-consumable tungsten electrode, a constant-current welding power supply, and a <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> source.|$|E
5|$|To perform {{gas metal arc}} welding, {{the basic}} {{necessary}} equipment is a welding gun, a wire feed unit, a welding power supply, a welding electrode wire, and a <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> supply.|$|E
5|$|Flux-cored {{arc welding}} (FCAW) – almost {{identical}} to MIG welding except it uses a special tubular wire filled with flux; {{it can be used}} with or without <b>shielding</b> <b>gas,</b> depending on the filler.|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} relates {{generally to}} trailer <b>shields</b> for <b>gas</b> <b>shielded</b> arc welding torches, and more particularly to a trailer shield assembly provided with a <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> manifold for providing an even dispersion of <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> to {{the interior of the}} shield assembly, which generally encloses a joint being welded and a welding trailing portion of hot welded metal. The novelty of the invention lies in providing trailer shield with a manifold tube having a plurality of openings from which <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> is distributed. A gas manifold region ahead of the torch is also provided with <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> from a tube to protect metal preheated by the torch. Further novelty lies in constructing portions of sides and housing and portions of side walls of the guide of stainless steel screen having a tight mesh...|$|R
40|$|A <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> {{flow rate}} of 15 – 20 L min 21 is {{typically}} specified in {{metal inert gas}} welding, but is often adjusted to as high as 36 L min 21 by welders in practice. Not only is this overuse of <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> wasteful, but uncontrolled high gas flows can lead to significant turbulence induced porosity in the final weld. There is therefore a need to understand and control the minimum <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate used in practical welding where cross-drafts may affect the coverage. Very low gas coverage or no shielding leads to porosity and spatter development in the weld region. A systematic study is reported of the weld quality achieved {{for a range of}} <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> flow rates, cross-draft speeds and nozzle diameters using optical visualisation and numerical modelling to determine the <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> coverage. As a consequence of the study, the <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> flow has been reduced to 12 L min 21 in production welding, representing a significant process cost saving and reduced environmental impact with no compromise to the final weld quality...|$|R
40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{problems}} of laser welding in <b>shielding</b> <b>gases.</b> On {{the basis of}} theoretical knowledge in this thesis, was made welding an experiment of 10 samples of steel X 5 CrNi 18 - 10 in two different <b>shielding</b> <b>gases.</b> Flow of <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> has been shown by schlieren method. On the samples of welding joints have been made mechanical tests (tensile test and hardness test). Welded joints were metallography evaluated and structure of them was confirmed by measurements on ferrite meter...|$|R
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW) – {{also known as}} TIG (tungsten, inert gas), uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld. The weld area is protected from atmospheric contamination by an inert <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> such as argon or helium.|$|E
5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in austenitic stainless steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> additive.|$|E
5|$|Flux-cored wire is {{considered}} to have some advantages for outdoor welding on-site, as the <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> plume {{is less likely to}} be blown away in a wind than shield gas from a conventional nozzle. A slight drawback is that, like SMAW (stick) welding, there may be some flux deposited over the weld bead, requiring more of a cleaning process between passes.|$|E
40|$|MPa grade Transformation Induced Plasticity {{steel plate}} were {{investigated}} under different welding power, welding speed and <b>shield</b> <b>gas.</b> Decreasing welding power, increasing welding speed or using mixed <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> (Ar+He) all reduced the porosity in the weld metal (WM). The weld metal and HAZ near the WM had maximum hardness. In {{tensile strength test}} of load perpendicular to the weld axis, the specimens had same tensile properties {{as that of the}} raw material. For the load parallel with the weld axis, the specimens prepared with Ar had equal yield strength (YS) and tensile strength (TS) to that of the raw material. But the elongation was lower than that of the raw material. The specimens prepared with <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> He had higher YS, TS and lower elongation compared with that of the raw material. The welded joint had lower formability than that of the raw material. The formability of specimens prepared with low welding power or mixed <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> Ar+He was improved compared with that of the specimens prepared using high power or single <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> Ar...|$|R

50|$|<b>Shielding</b> <b>gases</b> {{fall into}} two categories—inert or semi-inert. Only two of the noble gases, helium and argon, are cost {{effective}} enough {{to be used in}} welding. These inert gases are used in gas tungsten arc welding, and also in gas metal arc welding for the welding of non-ferrous metals. Pure argon and helium are used only for some nonferrous metals. Semi-inert <b>shielding</b> <b>gases,</b> or active <b>shield</b> <b>gases,</b> include carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen. Most of these gases, in large quantities, would damage the weld, but when used in small, controlled quantities, can improve weld characteristics.|$|R
5|$|GMAW {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular welding methods, {{especially}} in industrial environments. It is used extensively by the sheet metal industry and, by extension, the automobile industry. There, the method is often used for arc spot welding, thereby replacing riveting or resistance spot welding. It is also popular for automated welding, in which robots handle the workpieces and the welding gun to speed up the manufacturing process. GMAW can be difficult to perform well outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored arc welding is better suited for outdoor use such as in construction. Likewise, GMAW's use of a <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> does not lend itself to underwater welding, which is more commonly performed via shielded metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, or gas tungsten arc welding.|$|E
5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW) – {{commonly}} termed MIG (metal, inert gas), uses a wire feeding gun that feeds wire at an adjustable speed and flows an argon-based <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> or a mix of argon and carbon dioxide (CO2) over the weld puddle {{to protect it from}} atmospheric contamination.|$|E
5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> in {{arc welding}} {{processes}} on materials that at welding temperatures are contaminated and weakened by air or nitrogen. A number of inert shielding gases are used in gas tungsten arc welding, but helium is used instead of cheaper argon especially for welding materials that have higher heat conductivity, like aluminium or copper.|$|E
40|$|This work aims to {{elucidate}} {{the effects of}} using O 2, Ar and He <b>shield</b> <b>gasses</b> during {{the treatment of the}} ordinary Portland cement (OPC) surface of concrete with a high power diode laser (HPDL). The findings showed a marked difference existed in the surface condition of the concrete after HPDL treatment depending on the <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> used. The use of O 2 as the <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> was seen to result in glazes with far fewer microcracks and porosities than those generated with either Ar or He <b>shield</b> <b>gases.</b> Such differences were found to be due to the smaller O 2 gas molecules dissolving molecularly into the open structure of the HPDL generated glaze on the OPC surface of concrete and react with the glass network to increase the fluidity of the melt. This in turn was also seen to affect the cooling rate and therefore the tendency to generate microcracks...|$|R
40|$|A {{study on}} the plasma and <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> flow {{patterns}} in variable polarity plasma arc (VPPA) welding was undertaken by shadowgraph techniques. Visualization of gas flow under different welding conditions was obtained. Undercutting is often present with aluminum welds. The effects of torch alignment, <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate and gas contamination on undercutting were investigated and suggestions made to minimize the defect. A modified shield cup for the welding torch was fabricated which consumes much less <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> while maintaining the weld quality. The current torch was modified with a trailer flow for Al-Li welding, in which hot cracking is a critical problem. The modification shows improved weldablility on these alloys...|$|R

5|$|Originally {{developed}} for welding aluminium and other non-ferrous {{materials in the}} 1940s, GMAW was soon applied to steels because it provided faster welding time compared to other welding processes. The cost of inert gas limited its use in steels until several years later, when the use of semi-inert gases such as carbon dioxide became common. Further developments during the 1950s and 1960s gave the process more versatility and as a result, it became a highly used industrial process. Today, GMAW {{is the most common}} industrial welding process, preferred for its versatility, speed and the relative ease of adapting the process to robotic automation. Unlike welding processes that do not employ a <b>shielding</b> <b>gas,</b> such as shielded metal arc welding, it is rarely used outdoors or in other areas of air volatility. A related process, flux cored arc welding, often does not use a <b>shielding</b> <b>gas,</b> but instead employs an electrode wire that is hollow and filled with flux.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} wire electrode, a <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> feeds through the welding gun, which shields the process from {{contaminants}} in the air. The {{process can be}} semi-automatic or automatic. A constant voltage, direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current systems, as well as alternating current, can be used. There are four primary methods of metal transfer in GMAW, called globular, short-circuiting, spray, and pulsed-spray, {{each of which has}} distinct properties and corresponding advantages and limitations.|$|E
5|$|Argon is {{produced}} industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Argon is mostly {{used as an}} inert <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily unreactive substances become reactive; for example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. Argon is also used in incandescent, fluorescent lighting, and other gas-discharge tubes. Argon makes a distinctive blue-green gas laser. Argon is also used in fluorescent glow starters.|$|E

Spectrometer incorporated into control system to ensure quality of weld because in keyhole, arc fully penetrates weld joint and impurities flushed out. Apparatus helps ensure high quality of weld by monitoring such contaminants as oxygen and hydrogen in <b>shield</b> <b>gas,</b> detecting inadequate flow of <b>shield</b> <b>gas,</b> and sensing changes in temperature of arc with changes in arc current and voltage...|$|R

5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} arc welding, {{because it}} affords {{greater control over}} the weld area than other welding processes, can produce high-quality welds when performed by skilled operators. Maximum weld quality is assured by maintaining cleanliness—all equipment and materials used must be free from oil, moisture, dirt and other impurities, as these cause weld porosity and consequently a decrease in weld strength and quality. To remove oil and grease, alcohol or similar commercial solvents may be used, while a stainless steel wire brush or chemical process can remove oxides from the surfaces of metals like aluminum. Rust on steels can be removed by first grit blasting the surface and then using a wire brush to remove any embedded grit. These steps are especially important when negative polarity direct current is used, because such a power supply provides no cleaning during the welding process, unlike positive polarity direct current or alternating current. To maintain a clean weld pool during welding, the <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> flow should be sufficient and consistent so that the gas covers the weld and blocks impurities in the atmosphere. GTAW in windy or drafty environments increases the amount of <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> necessary to protect the weld, increasing the cost and making the process unpopular outdoors.|$|E
5|$|These {{processes}} use a welding {{power supply}} to create and maintain an electric arc between an electrode and the base material to melt metals at the welding point. They can use either direct (DC) or alternating (AC) current, and consumable or non-consumable electrodes. The welding region is sometimes protected by some type of inert or semi-inert gas, known as a <b>shielding</b> <b>gas,</b> and filler material is sometimes used as well.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} current, in {{the form}} of either alternating current or direct current from a welding power supply, is used to form an electric arc between the electrode and the metals to be joined. The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E
40|$|A {{diffuser}} assembly is provided for narrow groove welding using an automatic {{gas tungsten arc welding}} torch. The {{diffuser assembly}} includes manifold adapted for adjustable mounting on the welding torch which is received {{in a central}} opening in the manifold. Laterally extending manifold sections communicate with a <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> inlet such that <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> supplied to the inlet passes to gas passages of the manifold sections. First and second tapered diffusers are respectively connected to the manifold sections in fluid communication with the gas passages thereof. The diffusers extend downwardly along the torch electrode on opposite sides thereof so as to release <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> {{along the length of the}} electrode and at the distal tip of the electrode. The diffusers are of a transverse width which is on the order of the thickness of the electrode so that the diffusers can, in use, be inserted into a narrow welding groove before and after the electrode in the direction of the weld operation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{influence}} of <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> and welding positions on properties of duplex and superduplex stainless steel circumferential pipe welds. Corrosion resistance, microstructural features and weld defects were assessed and related to the welding procedures. Horizontal and vertical upward welding positions produced high quality welds. However, welding in the overhead position resulted in less good results in terms of porosity and corrosion resistance. <b>Shielding</b> <b>gases</b> containing 30 % helium showed best results, whilst using a mixture Ar+ 2 %CO 2 resulted in undercuts and porosity in all welding positions...|$|R
40|$|MIG Brazing (MIGB), as well {{as other}} hybrid variants, is meant to replace MIG welding, which usually {{introduces}} excessive heating. MIG welding of zinc coated thin plates in automotive industry leads to major issues, mainly zinc evaporation followed by a decrease of corrosion resistance, {{as well as}} to residual strains and stresses difficult to minimize. The use of MIGB with the recently commercialized allied copper based filler metal and various <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> is an alternative worth considering. Even when brazing, despite the lower melting temperature of the filler alloys, the effect of the electric arc heat is detrimental, especially on the zinc layer integrity and on the physical-chemical and metallurgical processes, which occurs in the plates and deposited material during the MIGB process. The present paper addresses the MIGB process, underlining the influence of the different <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> and process parameters on metal transfer and bead appearance when lower heat input procedures are targeted. It also briefly describes the influence of the different <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> and the process parameters on the mechanical, corrosion and metallurgical properties of the joint...|$|R
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), {{also known as}} tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, is an arc welding process that uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld. The weld area and electrode is protected from oxidation or other atmospheric contamination by an inert <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> (argon or helium), and a filler metal is normally used, though some welds, known as autogenous welds, do not require it. A constant-current welding power supply produces electrical energy, which is conducted across the arc through a column of highly ionized gas and metal vapors known as a plasma.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} {{metal parts}} of a torch are made of hard alloys of copper or brass so it can transmit current and heat effectively. The tungsten electrode must be held firmly {{in the center of}} the torch with an appropriately sized collet, and ports around the electrode provide a constant flow of <b>shielding</b> <b>gas.</b> Collets are sized according to the diameter of the tungsten electrode they hold. The body of the torch is made of heat-resistant, insulating plastics covering the metal components, providing insulation from heat and electricity to protect the welder.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} quality problems in GMAW are dross and porosity. If not controlled, they can lead to weaker, less ductile welds. Dross is an especially common problem in aluminium GMAW welds, normally coming from particles of aluminium oxide or aluminum nitride present in the electrode or base materials. Electrodes and workpieces must be brushed with a wire brush or chemically treated to remove oxides on the surface. Any oxygen {{in contact with the}} weld pool, whether from the atmosphere or the <b>shielding</b> <b>gas,</b> causes dross as well. As a result, sufficient flow of inert shielding gases is necessary, and welding in volatile air should be avoided.|$|E
50|$|The {{grinding}} chamber {{can also be}} filled with an inert <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> that does not react with the material being ground, to prevent oxidation or explosive reactions that could occur with ambient air inside the mill.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Various {{types of}} <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> mixes {{are used for}} the {{industrial}} GMAW applications. The use of the direct current welding process with reverse or direct polarity influences the geometric characteristics of the beads as well as process dilution. In certain situations, such as weld deposits, the penetration should be as shallow as possible and the heat affected zone of the bead should be reduced. The paper presents the experimental procedure, the obtained results and the conclusions concerning the influence of polarity on the shape and geometry of the welding beam, while using various <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> and various welding parameters and by changing polarities...|$|R
5|$|Flux-cored welding {{machines}} are most popular at the hobbyist level, as the machines are slightly simpler but mainly because they avoid {{the cost of}} providing <b>shield</b> <b>gas,</b> either through a rented cylinder or with {{the high cost of}} disposable cylinders.|$|R
