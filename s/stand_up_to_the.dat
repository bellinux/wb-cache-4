5|$|Riesling is a {{versatile}} wine for pairing with food, {{because of its}} balance of sugar and acidity. It can be paired with white fish or pork, {{and is one of}} the few wines that can <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stronger flavours and spices of Thai and Chinese cuisine. A Riesling's typical aromas are of flowers, tropical fruits, and mineral stone (such as slate or quartz), although, with time, the wine acquires a petrol note as mentioned above.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} soundtrack {{was highly}} praised; reviewers noted {{it as one}} of the best video game soundtracks of the year, praising the originality of the compositions and the beauty of Emi Evans' vocal work. The first arranged album, while also warmly received, was perceived by critics to be weaker than the original and not long enough to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> expectations created by the success of the original. The first three albums sold well enough to be recorded on the Japanese Oricon music charts, reaching number 24 for the original soundtrack, 59 for the first arranged album, and position number 77 for the second.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the {{construction}} of Test Track, numerous problems occurred causing delays in the ride opening. One problem that Imagineers had to overcome was that the wheels used on the ride vehicles could not <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> demand of the ride course and speed. This problem was resolved but a second, more severe problem caused the ride to be delayed by over a year. In order for Test Track to run with the highest hourly capacity possible, twenty-nine ride vehicles would be needed. The ride programming system could only handle operating a maximum of six cars over the layout of the ride. One by one, programmers were able to get the computer system able to run twenty-nine ride vehicles all at once. After these problems were resolved, Test Track soft-opened to the public on December 19, 1998. The ride was still prone to breakdowns and didn't officially open until March 17, 1997.|$|E

25|$|He {{began his}} crusade against the Mafia by {{claiming}} that government officials were receiving help in their elections from Cosa Nostra.

25|$|Contact lenses {{are often}} {{categorized}} by their replacement schedule. Single use lenses (called 1-day or daily disposables) are discarded after one use. Because {{they do not}} have to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wear and tear of repeated uses, these lenses can be made thinner and lighter, greatly improving their comfort. Lenses replaced frequently gather fewer deposits of allergens and germs, making these lenses preferable for patients with ocular allergies or for those who are prone to infection. Single-use lenses are also useful for people who wear contact lenses infrequently, or when losing a lens is likely or not easily replaced (such as when on vacation). They are also considered useful for children because cleaning or disinfecting is not needed, leading to improved compliance.|$|E
25|$|Educated at Diocesan College, Rondebosch, Bisset soon {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a batsman and a wicket keeper who could <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fastest bowlers, and made his first class cricket debut for Western Province on 18 April 1895 against Transvaal at Durban, scoring 0 and five not out. Despite this setback, Bisset was a regular member of the Western Province side, scoring an unbeaten 124 against Transvaal in 1897, leading to his announcement as captain of the Western Province side for the Currie Cup final that year. He scored 5 and 63*, enough to secure his position as South African captain against the touring English side. Aged 22, Bisset remained Test cricket's youngest ever captain until Ian Craig captained Australia in 1957.|$|E

25|$|India {{needed to}} cross 400 {{runs in the}} second innings just to make Australia bat again, which they had not scored even once in the entire series. But VVS Laxman seemed to have found the form that had eluded him the entire series. The {{complete}} range of cricket strokes was on display as Laxman flew to 167 in just 198 balls, being particularly savage on Brett Lee (taking 52 runs off 5 overs at one point) and Shane Warne. The rest of the Indian batting, however, could not <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> accuracy of Glen McGrath as he took five wickets {{to go with the}} fifer in the first innings. He was declared Man of the Match, as Australia won comprehensively by an innings and 141 runs.|$|E
25|$|As the Athenians advanced, they {{extended}} their left flank out to sea, outflanking the Spartans. The superior Athenian numbers, {{combined with the}} tactics they had implemented, created a dangerous situation for the Spartans, and Callicratidas' helmsman advised him to retire without a fight, but the navarch insisted on pushing on. Dividing his force in two to meet the threat of encirclement, Callicratidas led his fleet into battle. Heated fighting ensued for some time, but eventually Callicratidas, leading the Spartan right, was killed when his ship rammed an opposing ship, and resistance on the right collapsed. The left continued to resist for longer, {{but was unable to}} <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entire Athenian fleet and soon joined the right wing in flight. All told, the Spartans lost some 70 ships, and the Athenians 25.|$|E
25|$|Family, or lack thereof, remains {{important}} throughout both Hilde's {{childhood and}} adulthood. Hilde's childhood is laden with abuse and patriarchal superiority. This {{is represented by}} her father's harmful actions and her mother's unwillingness to ask her brothers to do housework. In the ideal fascist society the family unit mimicked the hierarchical structure of the state. In Hilde's case, the state was stronger and more stable than her own family unit. This is evident at {{the climax of the}} novel, when she is having an inner struggle about choosing to do what was right by Germany's standards or by Hannes' standards. In the end she chose Germany's — her family life was too weak and dysfunctional to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beliefs instilled by the state and the only morals she was aware of were state-taught.|$|E

25|$|After the {{assassination}} of Caligula in 41, Agrippa {{was involved in the}} struggle over the accession between Claudius, the Praetorian Guard, and the Senate. How big a part Agrippa played is uncertain; the various sources differ. Cassius Dio simply writes that Agrippa cooperated with Claudius in seeking rule. Flavius Josephus gives us two versions. In The Jewish War, Agrippa is presented as only a messenger to a confident and energetic Claudius. But in The Antiquities of the Jews, Agrippa's role is central and crucial: he convinces Claudius to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Senate and the Senate to avoid attacking Claudius. After becoming Emperor, Claudius gave Agrippa dominion over Judea and Samaria and granted him the ornamenta consularia, and at his request gave the kingdom of Chalcis in Lebanon to Agrippa's brother Herod of Chalcis. Thus Agrippa {{became one of the most}} powerful kings of the east. His domain more or less equaled that which was held by his grandfather Herod the Great.|$|E
25|$|At this time, Heffer was {{a strong}} proponent of British {{membership}} of the EEC. He headed a study group established by the Society for Parliamentary Studies (a group for left-wing Labour MPs) to look into British relations with Europe, and demanded the resignation of Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Fred Peart when Peart expressed doubts about {{the merits of the}} Common Agriculture Policy. At the 1967 Labour Party conference, Heffer argued for Britain in Europe to build up a third force in the world which would <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> USA and the Soviet Union. He also began a campaign to win a place on the National Executive Committee at this conference, standing again each year and steadily building his support. Another preoccupation which began at this time was the Waterloo Cup, a hare coursing event at Great Altcar near his constituency: he promoted unsuccessful Private Member's Bill to ban hare coursing, returning to the subject at intervals over the next decade.|$|E
25|$|His {{popularity}} in Australia saw Hall invited {{to play with}} Queensland for the 1961–62 Sheffield Shield season. Hall enjoyed an immensely successful season with Queensland and {{a key part of}} the team's second place in the Sheffield Shield competition—behind perennial powerhouse New South Wales. Hall took 43 wickets for the season at an average of 20.25, trailing only Richie Benaud of New South Wales in the season aggregate. Hall's 43 wickets set a new record for a Queensland bowler in a first-class cricket season. Hall returned for a second season with Queensland in 1962–63, taking 33 wickets for the season as Queensland again finished runner-up in the Sheffield Shield, this time to Victoria. Towards the end of Hall's second season, it became clear that the demands of playing cricket 12 months of the year were starting to take a toll on Hall. Queensland were keen to see Hall return for another season in 1963–64 but Hall declined, fearing his body would not <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> strain.|$|E
