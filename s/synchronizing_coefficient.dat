30|$|For VSCs without {{constant}} voltage-source supply on the DC side, {{namely the}} PS/CC-VSCs and PS/VC-VSCs, the DC-link has an inherent electromechanical swing dynamic. It can be utilized for SG-imitation, such as Cases 7 and 13 in Table  1. On this occasion, the equivalent inertia coefficient directly {{depends on the}} DC capacitance and the rated voltage of the DC-link. It gives a physical insight of the equivalent inertia. In terms of the VSCs without utilizing the DC-link dynamic directly, such as Cases 6 and 12, the equivalent inertia {{seems to be a}} flexible configuration. However, the constraints of the short-term power supply on the DC side must be considered when selecting inertia parameter as there is no ES. For those VSCs with ES, namely the VS/CC-VSCs and VS/VC-VSCs, the DC-link voltage almost maintains a constant. Their equivalent inertia can be freely configured according to the system requirements. It is obvious that the equivalent <b>synchronizing</b> <b>coefficient</b> of VC-VSCs is completely consistent with that of the traditional SGs, seen from Cases 1 to 7. Nevertheless, as a current-source relying on the synchronization to a stable grid voltage, the equivalent <b>synchronizing</b> <b>coefficient</b> of most CC-VSCs is related to the parameters of the PLL or the reconstructed PLL.|$|E

30|$|Based on the {{relationship}} between the current angle and the traditional power angle, the proposed Phillips- Heffron model of the CC-VSC can be applied in the multiple-machine system. Taking the two-machine power system as a basic case, the small-signal stability analysis is investigated. It is revealed that the inertia, the damping and <b>synchronizing</b> <b>coefficient</b> of CC-VSC will influence the coupling oscillation of the whole system. Based on the proposed model and the theoretical analysis, parameter optimization of the CC-VSCs can be achieved {{from the perspective of the}} small-signal stability of the modern power system including VSCs and SGs.|$|E
30|$|In {{more complex}} systems the power flows and <b>synchronizing</b> <b>coefficients</b> vary {{too much for}} the assumed {{characteristics}} to remain accurate for long. Therefore, the relay characteristic will become either too sensitive, allowing inappropriate operation, or insensitive, preventing the relay from ever operating. Although the relay setting could be updated as conditions vary, ongoing adjustment of protection in this way is undesirable; as it will likely serve as a source of hidden failures (as any maintenance of protection schemes can be).|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{damping torque}} of linearized models of power systems is studied {{here as a}} {{possible}} on-line security index, based on system identification techniques applied to realistic measurements. First, the theoretical values of damping and <b>synchronizing</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the electromagnetic torque are discussed in detail. These values are then used to investigate the accuracy of damping coefficient identified from on-line measurements using the ordinary least square (OLS) method. It is demonstrated that OLS {{may not be able}} to correctly estimate the coefficients due to the nonlinear nature of power system oscillations. Hence, generalized least square (GLS) and robust fitting with bisquare weights (RFBW) are applied to this system identification problem, showing to be better alternatives. Based on these results, the damping coefficient is proposed and studied as an index to calculate the distance to the closest oscillatory instability point. The results obtained from 3 test cases show that the index is an effective tool, and can be of significant help to operators for on-line security monitoring of power systems.

30|$|Resembling the Phillips-Heffron {{modeling}} of traditional SG, the equivalent inertia K J denotes the power cost for altering the angular {{frequency of the}} CC-VSC. The <b>synchronizing</b> <b>coefficient</b> K S reflects the performance supporting machine-grid synchronism. As shown in (15), the integral regulator of PLL leads to the synchronizing property, which takes charge of restoring the operation point when it deviates from its steady state. The damping coefficient K D represents the capability for damping the oscillation of angular frequency. It is apparent in (15) that proportional regulator of PLL in CC-VSC generates the effect of damping. If J, k p and k i are all positive, K J, K S and K D will be positive correspondingly under the condition of normal operating point (cosθ 0 > 0). That means the VSC is equipped with certain inertia, damping and synchronizing ability. These parameters are important physical concepts to represent the dynamic characteristics of the SG in the classical stability theory.|$|E
30|$|This paper categorizes various VSCs {{into four}} types {{according}} to the energy supply on the DC side and the control modes on the AC side. There are PS/CC-VSCs, VS/CC-VSCs, VS/VC-VSCs and PS/VC-VSCs. It is revealed that the SG-equivalent electromechanical swing dynamic can be extracted from all the VSCs. The key point on SG-imitation is {{taking advantage of the}} real or virtual energy buffer in VSCs. Then, a complete framework of SG-equivalent small-signal modeling of all kinds of VSCs is established. The VSCs with different application environments have similar dynamic behavior, and the behavior characteristics can be represented by the classical Phillips–Heffron model. Thus, the equivalent inertia, <b>synchronizing</b> <b>coefficient,</b> and damping coefficient in different VSCs are derived and compared. The modeling framework based on a comparison with a traditional SG is beneficial for clearly cognizing the VSC-based DGs. Finally, the future research trend is addressed. Some important topics are mentioned: improvement of effective and practical SG-equivalent strategies considering the particularity of different VSC-based DGs, performance improvement by exploiting the potential flexibility of VSC-based DGs, more thorough understanding of the dissimilarity, migrating application of modeling and analysis theories, and formulating or revising future standards for the new system.|$|E
30|$|Figure  7 c {{demonstrates}} the trajectories of the eigenvalues as the <b>synchronizing</b> <b>coefficient</b> of CC-VSC decreasing {{which is caused}} by the decrease of the parameter k i. According to the sensitivity analysis, it is revealed that the conjugated eigenvalues # 1 and # 2 are sensitive to the state variables ∆δ 2 and ∆ω 2 and the conjugated eigenvalues # 3 and # 4 are sensitive to the state variables ∆δ 1 and ∆ω 1 when the parameter k i is larger than 90. In this parameter range, the frequency of the oscillation mode which is dominated by the CC-VSC decreases gradually, while the damping ratio increases with the parameter k i decreasing. In the parameter range from 90 to 50, all the eigenvalues are influenced by the state variables ∆δ 1, ∆ω 1, ∆δ 2 and ∆ω 2 together and there is little difference between the strengths of influence. As shown in Fig.  7 c, the conjugated eigenvalues # 3 and # 4 move to the right half plane significantly in this parameter range with the parameter k i decreasing. When the parameter k i of the CC-VSC is less than 55 in this case, the two-machine system will be unstable.|$|E

The system stability is studied both through eigenvalue analysis and EMTDC/PSCAD simulation studies. It is shown that the combination of the SSSC and the fixed capacitor improves the <b>synchronizing</b> power <b>coefficient.</b> The presence of the fixed capacitor ensures increased damping of small signal oscillations. At higher levels of fixed capacitor compensation, a damping controller is required to stabilize the torsional modes of SSR...|$|R
40|$|The {{installed}} capacity and the grid access request for renewables is anticipated to continue {{rising in the}} EU and US in the coming years. The scarcity of reactive power and synchronous inertia are two inherent consequences of high penetration of renewables in the power system. This raises voltage security concerns, and may endanger rotor angle and frequency stability. In order to foresee these challenges, {{it is essential to}} carry out extensive planning and operation studies. Thus, new methodologies and innovative metrics are required to ensure secure and reliable operation of power systems. In this thesis, a multi-operating condition AC voltage stability constraint optimal power flow framework has been presented for transmission system planning. This framework captures multiple wind and demand operating conditions within an optimal power flow tool. The voltage stability constrained optimal power flow was applied to wind capacity allocation. It was shown that the capacity allocation pattern affects steady state voltage stability and the total allocated wind capacity. This indicates that a well-chosen allocation of wind capacity is not only in line with the trend of renewables integration in power systems but also enables limiting the occurrence probability of insecure operating points that may require costly remedies. A procedure for wind capacity allocation has been presented based on the finding on the effects of the pattern of wind capacity allocation on voltage stability. This benefits from the potential of an optimal wind capacity allocation for enhancing the voltage stability margin. Unit commitment was employed {{to take into account the}} reduction of the available reactive power sources at each operating condition for wind capacity allocation. By setting the wind capacity target and tracking the loadability margin, it was shown how the risk for a reduction in loadability margin may increase with allocation of wind generation. This procedure showed that specific locations in the system are favored for capacity allocation. It also identified weak areas in the network that experience a reduction in the loadability margin as a result of the allocation of the wind capacity. The methodology can help system operators prioritize network access and investment in the network to enhance the integration of renewables. Further, this thesis focused on the power system frequency aspect of renewables integration. Synchronous inertia acts as a means of immediate frequency support in power imbalances. Renewables often inject power into the network through power electronic converters. As such, synchronizing torque and synchronous inertia are not available in the power from renewables. Reduced levels of synchronizing torque raise concerns on rotor speed behavior under power imbalance events. The interaction of generators has been investigated by deriving the <b>synchronizing</b> torque <b>coefficient</b> matrix from the multi-machine Heffron-Philips model. It was shown that the reactive power output of the generators can be used to control the elements of the <b>synchronizing</b> torque <b>coefficient</b> matrix. It was identified that the varying levels of synchronizing torque affect the rate of change rotor speed of generators following a loss of generation event. Furthermore, the effect of rotor speed deviation due to synchronizing torque was presented from the system frequency perspective. This provides a foundation for system operators to establish strategies that benefit from the <b>synchronizing</b> torque <b>coefficient</b> matrix characteristics for controlling the frequency behavior...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} hybrid opposition based disruption operator in gravitational search algorithm (DOGSA) to solve automatic generation control (AGC) problem of four area hydro-thermal-gas interconnected power system. The proposed DOGSA approach combines the advantages of opposition based learning which enhances the speed of convergence and disruption operator which {{has the ability to}} further explore and exploit the search space of standard gravitational search algorithm (GSA). The addition of these two concepts to GSA increases its flexibility for solving the complex optimization problems. This paper addresses the design and performance analysis of DOGSA based proportional integral derivative (PID) and fractional order proportional integral derivative (FOPID) controllers for automatic generation control problem.

30|$|Besides the {{parameters}} of PLL, other {{factors such as the}} output power, the grid voltage and the impedance of transmission line also play an important role on the small- signal stability. When the output power of CC-VSC is large, it means that the steady-state angle θ 0 between the terminal voltage of CC-VSC and the grid voltage is large. It is also the steady-state power angle δ 0 in traditional power system. As demonstrated in (15), {{it is obvious that the}} large θ 0 makes the stability deteriorate, by degrading the damping performance and the synchronizing ability. Likewise, the amplitude of grid voltage can also influence the small-signal stability, by altering the value of equivalent <b>synchronizing</b> <b>coefficient</b> and damping coefficient. When the grid voltage dips, both the damping performance and the synchronizing ability will be weakened according to (15). It also helps explain why the CC-VSC system tends to lose its stability when suffering voltage sag. An important parameter of the system configuration is the impedance of the transmission line which is represented by an inductor L in Fig.  1. A large inductance indicates a large virtual mechanical torque, as shown in (13). Under the condition of the steady state, the virtual mechanical torque is equal to the virtual electromagnetic torque which is also represented in (13). Thus, it is inferred that the steady-state angle θ 0 is large with the large inductance. As mentioned above, the large θ 0 degrades the damping performance and the synchronizing ability of the CC-VSC system. Therefore, it is evident that larger inductance of transmission line is unfavorable, because it will lead to weaker small-signal stability. The traditional power system theory also presents that the compactness of electrical link between two interconnected power sources depends on the inductance of the transmission line: if the linking inductance is larger, the electrical connection will be weaker, and the stability will get worse.|$|E
40|$|Renewables are {{increasingly}} replacing power from conventional generators. Renewable power injected through power electronic converters lacks the fundamental electric torque components. Electric torque components {{have an important}} role in determining the behavior of conventional machines in the network. The influence of this factor becomes more notable in power systems with reduced inertia. Hence, questions arise on, how can synchronizing torque basically contribute to the rotor speed deviation and eventually the system frequency {{and if there is a}} potential for using the steady state <b>synchronizing</b> torque <b>coefficient</b> (STC) to achieve acceptable frequency operating points. This paper calculates the steady state STC matrix by using the multi-machine Heffron-Philips model in conjunction with the network admitance matrix.

30|$|Along {{with the}} {{increasing}} penetration of distributed generation with voltage-source converters (VSCs), there are extensive concerns over the potential virtual rotor angle stability, which is characterized by oscillations of power and frequency during the dynamic process of synchronization in the grid. Several control strategies {{have been developed for}} VSCs to emulate rotating inertia as well as damping of oscillations. This paper classifies these strategies and provides a small-signal modeling framework including all kinds of VSCs in different applications for virtual rotor angle stability. A unified perspective based on the famous Phillips–Heffron model is established for various VSCs. Thus, the concepts of equivalent inertia and the <b>synchronizing</b> and damping <b>coefficients</b> in different VSCs are highlighted, based on the similarities with the synchronous generator (SG) system in both physical mechanisms and mathematical models. It revealed the potentiality of various VSCs to achieve equivalence with the SG.

30|$|In {{order to}} analyze the small-signal {{stability}} of modern power system with VSCs, a promising solution is to establish SG-equivalent model for the VSCs [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. It is the classic Phillips-Heffron model, which characterizes the SG dynamics with inertia, <b>synchronizing</b> and damping <b>coefficients</b> [13, 14]. Based on the Phillips-Heffron model, the well-developed small-signal stability theories in traditional power system can be applied in the modern power system with VSCs. For the voltage-controlled (VC) VSCs [15], the droop controlled VSC and traditional SG is proved to have an equivalent dynamic in the electro- mechanical time scale [8]. The Phillips-Heffron model of the VC-VSC has been successfully applied to the synchronization and stability analysis for microgrid with multiple VSCs [12]. The classic Kuramoto oscillator theory can be applied in this case, which is originally applied for the stability analysis of the traditional power system based on multiple SGs [16]. Besides the VC-VSCs, a lot of VSCs are operated in current-controlled (CC) mode because of the simplicity of its control strategy and the adequate utilization of the renewable energy [17, 18]. Nevertheless, the equivalence between the dynamic characteristics of the CC-VSC and the traditional SG has been hardly studied. As for the CC-VSCs, it is often regarded as an ideal current source and the dynamic of phase-locked-loop (PLL) is always overlooked. Such assumptions only hold true in strong grid with low penetration level of VSCs [11, 19]. The CC-VSC is considered to affect the small-signal stability of the system indirectly just by altering the steady state operation point of the SGs [19]. The interactive mechanism between the CC-VSC and the SGs has not been addressed. Some researches {{point out that the}} dynamic of PLL can significantly affect the system synchronization and stability [20, 21, 22, 23, 24], especially in the weak-grid system. As the penetration increasing, the effect of CC-VSCs on system stability becomes more prominent. Most of the researches investigate the effect of CC-VSCs on small-signal stability of the modern power system including CC-VSCs and SGs based on the system synthesis with the eigenvalues calculation of the whole system [19, 25, 26, 27]. The high-order mathematical model of the whole system is complicated, and the physical explanation of the VSC dynamic can hardly be recognized [26, 27]. Thus it is inconvenience to obtain the direct principle for the parameter optimizations of the CC-VSC to improve the small-signal stability [11].|$|R
