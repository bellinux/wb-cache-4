40|$|Purpose – Firms issuing equity {{securities}} for capital {{must recognize that}} this issuance may alter the ownership concentration of the firm. Through this change in ownership structure, the market liquidity of the firm's stock may also change, which has implications {{for the cost of}} equity capital and firm value. This paper aims to examine a specific security, the common <b>stock</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>warrant,</b> within this context. It also aims to posit that the decision to issue warrants has important implications for the firm's subsequent ownership structure and market liquidity. Design/methodology/approach – The paper's unique dataset of warrant‐issuing firms tracks the warrants from their issue through to their exercise. Based on the study of SEOs by Kothare, the ownership concentration and market liquidity of the underlying stock prior to and following warrant exercises are measured. The paper examines the causal relations between warrant exercises and ownership changes, and between ownership changes and market liquidity. Findings – The paper shows that firms experience a statistically and economically significant decrease in ownership concentration following warrant exercises. Examining the liquidity effects of this change in ownership, it shows that market liquidity increases significantly after the exercise of warrants, consistent with the literature. The decrease in concentration following warrant exercises is experienced exclusively by firm insiders. The paper also finds that outsiders increase their holdings in firms with a high concentration of inside holdings and in firms with a low concentration of outside holdings prior to warrant exercises; that is, they use warrant offerings to increase their influence in the firm. Originality/value – This study is the first to the authors' knowledge that investigates warrants through their entire life span, and the first {{to examine the effects of}} warrant exercises on the performance and market liquidity of the firm. The results contribute to securities issuance, ownership, and liquidity literatures. Paul Brockman, Brett C. Olse...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{multiple}} series of <b>stock</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>warrants</b> {{by the same}} firm is an interesting financial structure not just in America, but is common {{in countries such as}} Switzerland, Malaysia, and Singapore. This paper derives valuation formulas for multiple series of outstanding warrants. The theoretical warrant prices from this model are compared against existing models. We report a subtle slippage effect and also a cross dilution effect that cause the existing models, such as Galai-Schneller model, to be inappropriate for pricing such classes of multiple warrants. We also provide an example to illustrate the practicality of our model. The Greeks of the model are also derived in this paper. The complexity of multiple warrants could extend to other classes of contingent securities issued by the same firm but with differing expiry terms. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT...|$|R

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Business administration. When a firm requires funds for financing operations, managers face several alternatives. Managers may raise funds through the public markets or the private sector. They may issue equity, debt, or a mix of equity and debt. The type of security issued, size of the offering, and the timing and pricing of the issue represent additional options for firm managers. Mangers must consider the costs and benefits for the firm related to each alternative. Influencing the assessment of the costs and benefits are the incentives of the managers, {{which may or may not}} align with those of the firm's other stakeholders. This dissertation addresses the decision making process of firm managers when faced with raising funds for firm operations. I examine three broad corporate finance issues by employing a comprehensive hand-collected dataset of firms issuing common <b>stock</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>warrants.</b> These securities, which provide holders the option of buying shares of stock in the issuing firm for an exercise price, possess features that allow me to evaluate research questions related to corporate governance, ownership and liquidity, and the market for corporate control...|$|R
