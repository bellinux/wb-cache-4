5|$|Integrated {{education}} {{models are}} {{emerging in the}} academic world, a model which {{is referred to as}} T-shape and π-shaped education. T-shaped professionals are taught general knowledge in a few disciplines (e.g. management and engineering) and specific, deep knowledge in a <b>single</b> <b>domain</b> (e.g. design). This model also applies to companies, when they shift their focus from small T innovations (innovations involving only one discipline, like chemists) to big T innovations (innovations involving several disciplines, like design, ethnography, lead user, etc.). Like in education, this shift makes breaking down silos of departments and disciplines of knowledge essential.|$|E

Many-sorted first-order logic allows variables {{to have different}} sorts, which have different domains.

Many-sorted first-order logic is often used in the study of second-order arithmetic.|$|E
25|$|Cho et al. {{made the}} first study on {{policies}} for crawling scheduling. Their data set was a 180,000-pages crawl from the stanford.edu domain, in which a crawling simulation was done with different strategies. The ordering metrics tested were breadth-first, backlink count and partial Pagerank calculations. One of the conclusions was that if the crawler wants to download pages with high Pagerank early during the crawling process, then the partial Pagerank strategy is the better, followed by breadth-first and backlink-count. However, these results are for just a <b>single</b> <b>domain.</b> Cho also wrote his Ph.D. dissertation at Stanford on web crawling.|$|E

25|$|The {{simplest}} multidomain organization seen in proteins {{is that of}} a <b>single</b> <b>domain</b> {{repeated in}} tandem. The domains may interact with each other (domain-domain interaction) or remain isolated, like beads on string. The giant 30,000 residue muscle protein titin comprises about 120 fibronectin-III-type and Ig-type domains. In the serine proteases, a gene duplication event has {{led to the formation of}} a two β-barrel domain enzyme. The repeats have diverged so widely that there is no obvious sequence similarity between them. The active site is located at a cleft between the two β-barrel domains, in which functionally important residues are contributed from each domain. Genetically engineered mutants of the chymotrypsin serine protease were shown to have some proteinase activity even though their active site residues were abolished and it has therefore been postulated that the duplication event enhanced the enzyme's activity.|$|E
25|$|The head {{structure}} {{is followed by}} a variable combination of diverse DBL and CIDR proteins, and in many cases along with C2. This variation gives rise to different types of PfEMP1. The DBL-CIDR combination in a particular type of PfEMP1 protein is never random, but organized into specific sequences known as domain cassettes. In some domain cassettes, there are only two or few DBL domains and CIDR domains, but in others they cover {{the entire length of the}} PfEMP1. These differences are responsible for different binding capacity among different PfEMP1s. For instance, among the most well-known types, VAR3 (earlier called type 3 PfEMP1) is the smallest, consisting of only NTS with DBL1α and DBL2ε domains in the ECD. Its molecular size is approximately 150 kDa. In domain cassette (DC) 4 type, the ECD is made up of three domains DBLα1.1/1.4, CIDRα1.6 and DBLβ3. The DBLβ3 domain contains a binding site for intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1). This is particularly implicated with the development of brain infection. VAR2CSA is atypical in having a <b>single</b> <b>domain</b> cassette that consists of three N terminal DBLPAM domains followed by three DBLε domains and one CIDRPAM. The seven domains always occur together. The usual NTS is absent. The protein specifically binds to chondroitin sulphate A (CSA); hence the name VAR2CSA.|$|E

All applications thus protected form a shared <b>Single</b> Sign-On <b>domain.</b> <b>Single</b> Sign-Off specifies the reverse property where a user signing off at any given application within a <b>Single</b> Sign-On <b>domain</b> automatically terminates his access to all other applications within the same <b>Single</b> Sign-On <b>domain.</b>|$|R
500|$|Until 2001, each {{organization}} {{could only}} register a <b>single</b> <b>domain</b> {{and had to}} document its right to the name, either directly connected to the company's name or a trademark; this information was verified by Norid.

This resulted in a large {{increase in the number of}} domains, and the 100,000th domain was registered that same year. Originally only the basic Latin letters were permitted, but from 9 February 2004 an additional twenty-three characters from the Norwegian and Sami languages were permitted, along with the number of permitted domains per organization increasing to twenty. From 13 June 2007, all-numerical domains names were allowed. The 500,000th domain was registered in January 2011.

With standard first-order logic we have a <b>single</b> <b>domain</b> and each predicate is assigned one extension. With first-order modal logic we have a domain function that assigns each possible world its own domain, so that each predicate gets an extension only relative to these possible worlds. This allows us to model cases where, for example, Alex is a Philosopher, but {{might have been a}} Mathematician, and might not have existed at all.

2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the term}} [...] "eruv" [...] in modern Jewish usage often {{refers to the}} rope or string that creates a symbolic [...] "walled courtyard". However the term, in formal use as a legal term of Jewish law, refers {{to the process of}} sharing ownership within the enclosed domain. This is conducted using the norms and procedures of Jewish law, which has a law of property ownership and transfer distinct from the law of the surrounding society. The property transfer needed to create a shared domain on Shabbat under Jewish law is formally effected today by having one resident give some [...] "bread" [...] to another resident to keep, to create a joint ownership of food for the whole community. This is usually done by the rabbi of the community to ensure that it is done correctly, and the bread is usually matzo to ensure that it will be edible and usable for a long time. (It is usually replaced once each year.) In the Talmud and other classic rabbinic sources, the term eruv refers to the bread itself. Because the domains are enclosed and legally transferred to shared ownership, carrying objects within an eruv keeps them within a <b>single</b> <b>domain,</b> and hence does not break the prohibition of transferring objects from a private to a shared domain on Shabbat. Creating an eruv that involves public property requires the local government to permit a limited transfer of its domain (in addition to government permissions for placing markers on government property that may be required as a matter of local government law).|$|E
