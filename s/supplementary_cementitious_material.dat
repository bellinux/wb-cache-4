50|$|The T-O {{clay mineral}} {{kaolinite}} {{does not contain}} interlayer cations or interlayer water. The temperature of dehydroxylation depends on the structural layer stacking order. Disordered kaolinite dehydroxylates between 530 and 570 °C, ordered kaolinite between 570 and 630 °C. Dehydroxylated disordered kaolinite shows higher pozzolanic activity than ordered. The dehydroxylation of kaolin to metakaolin is an endothermic process due to {{the large amount of}} energy required to remove the chemically bonded hydroxyl ions. Above the temperature range of dehydroxylation, kaolinite transforms into metakaolin, a complex amorphous structure which retains some long-range order due to layer stacking. Much of the aluminum of the octahedral layer becomes tetrahedrally and pentahedrally coordinated.In order to produce a pozzolan (<b>supplementary</b> <b>cementitious</b> <b>material)</b> nearly complete dehydroxylation must be reached without overheating, i.e., thoroughly roasted but not burnt. This produces an amorphous, highly pozzolanic state, whereas overheating can cause sintering, to form a dead burnt, nonreactive refractory, containing mullite and a defect Al-Si spinel. Reported optimum activation temperatures vary between 550 and 850 °C for varying durations, however the range 650-750 °C is most commonly quoted. In comparison with other clay minerals kaolinite shows a broad temperature interval between dehydroxylation and recrystallization, much favoring the formation of metakaolin and the use of thermally activated kaolin clays as pozzolans. Also, because the octahedral layer is directly exposed to the interlayer (in comparison to for instance T-O-T clay minerals such as smectites), structural disorder is attained more easily upon heating.|$|E

This paper comprises of detailed study of major <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Cementitious</b> <b>Materials</b> (SCM) commonly used and new emerging materials as a replacement of natural resources used for construction activity in Indian context. In a general way we can define concrete as a mixture of Portland cement, sand, coarse aggregate and water. The most important <b>cementitious</b> <b>material</b> in concrete is Portland cement.

The physical properties as well as the chemical compositions of CFBC ash are thus distinct from those of PCC fly ash.

40|$|A {{promising}} way {{to mitigate}} autogenous shrinkage in <b>cementitious</b> <b>materials</b> {{with a low}} water-to-binder ratio is internal curing {{by the use of}} superabsorbent polymers. Superabsorbent polymers are able to absorb multiple times their weight in water and can be applied as an internal water reservoir to induce internal curing and mitigation of self-desiccation. Their purposefulness has been demonstrated in Portland cement pastes with and without silica fume. Nowadays, fly ash and blast-furnace slag containing binders are also frequently used in the construction industry. The results on autogenous shrinkage in materials blended with fly ash or blast-furnace slag remain scarce, especially after one week of age. This paper focuses on the autogenous shrinkage by performing manual and automated shrinkage measurements up to one month of age. Without superabsorbent polymers, autogenous shrinkage was reduced in cement pastes with the <b>supplementary</b> <b>cementitious</b> <b>materials</b> versus Portland cement pastes. At later ages, the rate of autogenous shrinkage is higher due to the pozzolanic activity of the <b>supplementary</b> <b>cementitious</b> <b>materials.</b> Internal curing by means of superabsorbent polymers is successful, independent of this long-term higher rate of shrinkage in mixtures with <b>supplementary</b> <b>cementitious</b> <b>materials.</b> Superabsorbent polymers proved to be successful in mitigating self-desiccation...|$|R

Portland cement (CEM I) in concrete is normally partially replaced by supplementary cementitious materials such as ground granulated blastfurnace slag or pulverised fuel ash.

This study has investigated use of waste London clay as a <b>supplementary</b> <b>cementitious</b> <b>material.</b> The optimum calcined clay was produced at 900 °C and concrete made with 30 wt% of CEM I replaced by calcined clay had 28 -day strengths greater than control samples.

When cement is replaced at 20, 30 and 40 wt. % ratios by dredging sediments, compressive and flexural strength values of concrete at 7 days decrease respectively. Low early strength is, on the other hand, compensated by the pozzolanic reactions taking place up to 28 days when the strength of blended concrete compositions reaches that of the reference Portland cement concrete.

This work analyzed the use of palm kernel shells as a component material in clay and were calcined at a high temperature of 800 °C. The palm kernel shells were used to replace clay at 10 %, 20 % and 30 % by weight. Strength activity index prescribed by ASTM C 311 {{was used to determine}} the maximum mixture proportion between calcined clay and palm kernel shells. The calcined clay and palm kernel shell mixtures that gave the maximum strength were subjected to an incremental replacement dosage of Portland cement between 10 % and 40 % by weight. Test results indicated that the maximum strength mixture proportion between clay and palm kernel shells was obtained at 20 % replacement of clay. Moreover the maximum value that showed a better strength performance through the incremental replacement by the calcined material was also at 20 % Portland cement replacement. The study recommended the use of palm kernel shells to a limit of 20 % clay replacement. The is because at higher content of palm kernel shells in clay calcined at a high temperature, more unreactive crystalline phases are formed that inhibit reactivity of pozzolanic active phases. The use of 20 wt. % of palm kernel shells in clay to produce a <b>supplementary</b> <b>cementitious</b> <b>material</b> provides a sustainable means of waste disposal via construction application...|$|E
