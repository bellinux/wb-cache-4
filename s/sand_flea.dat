40|$|Tungiasis is a {{parasitic}} {{skin disease}} widespread in resource-poor {{urban and rural}} communities in Brazil. Inhabitants of an urban slum in Northeast Brazil were examined {{for the presence of}} tungiasis lesions and followed-up twice a week for a period of three weeks. Each time the number, stages, and topographic localization of lesions were recorded on a documentation sheet. The infestation rate (number of newly embedded <b>sand</b> <b>fleas</b> per individual and day) remained stable during the observation period. The infestation rate was significantly related to the intensity of infestation (total number of lesions present) (rho = 0. 70, p < 0. 0001) and the proportion of viable lesions (rho = 0. 28, p < 0. 0001). The results indicate that in an endemic area the infestation intensity and the proportion of viable lesions {{can be used as a}} proxy to assess the exposure of individuals at risk for tungiasis.

50|$|In {{the early}} (pre-1930) {{parts of the}} last century, the coastal areas of northernmost South Carolina were used mostly as farming sites (the real estate {{monolith}} now known as Burroughs and Chapin for decades was named “Myrtle Beach Farms”).

30|$|Treatment of tungiasis {{involves}} {{identification of}} the parasite especially through mechanical removal using a sterile, sharp pointed object such as a needle or pin followed by an antiseptic dressing. It may also be effectively treated by surgical extraction of embedded <b>sand</b> <b>fleas</b> under sterile conditions in medical facilities [13]. The fleas may also be deterred by washing the affected areas with disinfectants like potassium permanganate, topographic application of anti-parasitic agents, use of anti-inflammatory creams and use of repellents [14].

50|$|Sandhoppers (such as Talitrus saltator, {{also called}} <b>sand</b> <b>fleas)</b> are small shrimp-like {{crustaceans}} that live on beaches. When taken off a beach, they easily {{find their way}} {{back down to the}} sea. An experiment described by Lockley showed that this was not simply by moving downhill or towards the sight or sound of the sea. A group of sandhoppers were acclimatised to a day/night cycle under artificial lighting, whose timing was gradually changed until it was 12 hours out of phase with the natural cycle. Then, the sandhoppers were placed on the beach in natural sunlight. They moved roughly 180° from the correct direction down to the sea, up the beach. The experiment implied that the sandhoppers use the sun and their internal clock to determine their heading, and that they had learnt the actual direction down to the sea on their particular beach.|$|R
25|$|During tidal immersion, {{the food}} supply to {{intertidal}} organisms is subsidized by materials carried in seawater, including photosynthesizing phytoplankton and consumer zooplankton. These plankton are eaten by numerous forms of filter feeders—mussels, clams, barnacles, sea squirts, and polychaete worms—which filter seawater {{in their search for}} planktonic food sources. The adjacent ocean is also a primary source of nutrients for autotrophs, photosynthesizing producers ranging in size from microscopic algae (e.g. benthic diatoms) to huge kelps and other seaweeds. These intertidal producers are eaten by herbivorous grazers, such as limpets that scrape rocks clean of their diatom layer and kelp crabs that creep along blades of the feather boa kelp Egregia eating the tiny leaf-shaped bladelets. Crabs are eaten by goliath grouper, which are then eaten by sharks. Higher up the food web, predatory consumers—especially voracious starfish—eat other grazers (e.g. snails) and filter feeders (e.g. mussels). Finally, scavengers, including crabs and <b>sand</b> <b>fleas,</b> eat dead organic material, including dead producers and consumers.|$|R

5000|$|Operation <b>Sand</b> <b>Flea</b> was {{a series}} of {{training}} exercises for the December 1989 invasion of Panama by the United States. These troop movements and practice assaults were conducted in part as training to defend the Panama Canal (a contingency then called Purple Storm), but were also intended simply to affirm the right of the US military to engage in them. Conducted in the summer of 1989, these seemingly endless movements, also known as [...] "Freedom of Movement Drills," [...] overwhelmed the ability of the Panamanians to observe, analyze and understand the activities.

50|$|Nabkhas {{develop their}} own ecosystems. They are home {{to a variety of}} animals, {{including}} many invertebrates such as nematodes and the <b>sand</b> <b>flea</b> Talochestria capensis. The dune tends to have more organic material than the surrounding sand, as windblown plant matter accumulates in it and the roots of the plant penetrate it. In degraded and oil-polluted desert areas in Kuwait, plants with nabkhas act as ecosystem engineers, hosting a sheltered site with layers of relatively rich soil in which other plants can grow. Nabkhas on nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can have elevated nitrogen levels and other nutrients that other plants can use. The dunes can become islands of plant diversity in otherwise poor habitat.|$|E
40|$|Tungiasis is an ectoparasitosis causing {{considerable}} pathology in endemic areas. Standard therapy {{consists of}} removing the embedded parasite with a sterile needle. There is no effective chemotherapy at hand. To fill this gap, a double-blinded randomized controlled trial with oral ivermectin was conducted. A total of 54 individuals (27 {{in the placebo}} group, 27 in the ivermectin group) was followed up for seven days. They presented a total of 192 lesions. Patients received either ivermectin (300 µg/kg body weight at a single dose, repeated after 24 h) or placebo.

40|$|Tungiasis is an {{important}} health problem in poor communities in Brazil and is associated with severe morbidity. Prevalence rates are high in endemic areas. The causative agent, the female flea Tunga penetrans, burrows into the skin of its host, where it develops, produces eggs and eventually dies. The natural history of Tungiasis has not been described until now. An effective chemotherapy is not yet established. Clinical, scanning electron microscopy and histological findings allowed dividing {{the natural history of}} Tungiasis into five stages. The proposed Fortaleza Classification can be used for clinical and epidemiological purposes. It allows a more precise diagnosis, enables the assessment of chemotherapeutic approaches and helps to evaluate control measures on the community level. The examination of 86 individuals showed a broad spectrum of clinical and histopathological alterations. Clinical pathology was significantly related to the number of lesions. The evaluation of three topical antiparasitic agents showed that topical ivermectin, metrifonate or thiabendazole can each significantly reduce the number of lesions caused by embedded <b>sand</b> <b>fleas.</b> Further studies are needed to optimize the doses and administration of these compounds...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – This review {{focuses on}} the neosomes, morphology, and {{taxonomy}} of adult species of the genus Tunga, complementing the previously published data on the phylogeny, ecology, and pathogenic role. Neosomes are struc-tures formed after penetration of adult females into the skin of hosts resulting in significant enlargement, being the most characteristic and most frequently observed form in hosts. Neosomes can be differentiated by shape, mea-surements, and sites of attachment to principal hosts. The taxonomic value and morphometric data {{of the most widely}} used characteristics to separate species – such as frontal curvature, head chaetotaxy, preoral internal sclerotization, ventral and dorsal genal lobes, eyes, maxillary palps, fusion of pronotum and mesonotum, metacoxae, metatarsi chae-totaxy, spermatheca (females), manubrium, basimere, telomere, and phallosome (males) – are comparatively ana-lyzed. The sexes, individual variations, undescribed species, higher taxa, as well as a proposal for division of the genus into two subgenera (Tunga and Brevidigita) are presented (as previously given by Wang). A key for females, males, and gravid females (neosomes) also is included for identifying the 13 known species. Data on host specificity and geographical distribution may also support the identification of Tunga species because some <b>sand</b> <b>fleas</b> and thei...|$|R
