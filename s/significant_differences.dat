50|$|There are {{performance}} {{differences and}} similarities between this class and other wheelchair classes. A 1999 study of discus throwers {{found that for}} F5 to F8 discus throwers, the upper arm tends to be near horizontal {{at the moment of}} release of the discus. F5 to F7 discus throwers have greater angular speed of the shoulder girdle during release of the discus than the lower number classes of F2 to F4. F5 and F8 discus throwers have less average angular forearm speed than F2 and F4 throwers. F2 and F4 speed is caused by use of the elbow flexion to compensate for the shoulder flexion advantage of F5 to F8 throwers. A study of javelin throwers in 2003 found that F6 throwers have angular speeds of the shoulder girdle similar to that of F4, F5, F3, F7, F8 and F9 throwers.
