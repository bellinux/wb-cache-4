5|$|Aposematic animals {{often have}} (honest) threat displays; edible prey <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> (bluffing) startle displays. For example the frilled lizard, Chlamydosaurus kingii, is {{illustrated}} in a drawing by Cott, with its tail raised over the body, stretched up on all four legs, mouth wide open, and frills out {{both sides of the}} head, making it a startling sight.|$|E
5|$|Tengu are {{commonly}} depicted holding a magical , fans made of feathers. In folk tales, these fans <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> {{the ability to}} grow or shrink a person's nose, but usually they are attributed the power to stir up great winds. Various other strange accessories {{may be associated with}} tengu, such as a type of tall, one-toothed geta sandal often called tengu-geta.|$|E

5|$|As part of Romblon, Banton is {{classified}} under Type III of the Corona climatic classification system. This type of climate {{is described as}} having no prominent wet or dry seasons. The wet season, which usually occurs from June to November can extend up to December during {{the onset of the}} southwest monsoon. The dry season from January to May may <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> periods of rainfall or even inclement weather.|$|E
5|$|Cancer is {{a change}} in the {{cellular}} processes that cause a tumour to grow out of control. Cancerous cells <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> mutations in oncogenes, such as KRAS and CTNNB1 (β-catenin). Analysing the molecular signature of cancerous cellsthe DNA and its levels of expression via messenger RNAenables physicians to characterise the cancer and to choose the best therapy for their patients. As of 2010, assays that incorporate an array of antibodies against specific protein marker molecules are an emerging technology; there are hopes for these multiplex assays that could measure many markers at once. Other potential future biomarkers include micro RNA molecules, which cancerous cells express more of than healthy ones.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Sclerodermatineae have {{fruit body}} shapes ranging from boletoid (with a cap, stipe, and tubes on the {{underside}} of the cap) to gasteroid. Boletoid fruit bodies <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> hollow stipes with a surface that is smooth to somewhat furfuraceous (covered with flaky particles), and lack the reticulation (a net-like pattern of interlacing lines) characteristic of some members of the Boletaceae. The pores are merulioid (wrinkled with low, uneven ridges), boletinoid, and either fine or coarse. The flesh is usually whitish to yellowish, and some species exhibit a blue staining reaction upon injury. In mass, spores are yellow; microscopically, the spores are ellipsoid in shape and have a smooth surface.|$|E

5|$|More than 5000 {{cases of}} {{poisoning}} {{occur in the}} United States each year. Those affected are often adults and male. Deaths from ethylene glycol have been reported as early as 1930. An outbreak of deaths in 1937 due to a medication mixed in a similar compound, diethylene glycol, resulted in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 in the United States which mandated evidence of safety before new medications could be sold. Antifreeze products <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> a substance to make it bitter added to discourage drinking by children and other animals but {{this has not been}} found to be effective.|$|E
5|$|Public school {{instruction}} in music in Baltimore began in 1843. Prior to that, itinerant and professional singing masters were the dominant form of formal {{music education in}} the state. Music institutions like the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> programs aimed at youth education, and other organizations have a similar focus. The Eubie Blake Center exists to promote African American culture, and music, to both youth and adults, through dance classes for all age groups, workshops, clinics, seminars and other programs.|$|E
5|$|The {{sculptured}} mounds <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> {{elaborate and}} distinctive forms, {{such as those}} of the compass termite (Amitermes meridionalis and A. laurensis), which builds tall, wedge-shaped mounds with the long axis oriented approximately north–south, which gives them their common name. This orientation has been experimentally shown to assist thermoregulation. The north-south orientation causes the internal temperature of a mound to increase rapidly during the morning while avoiding overheating from the midday sun. The temperature then remains at a plateau {{for the rest of the}} day until the evening.|$|E

5|$|The {{spore print}} is olive-brown. The smooth oval spores measure 12–15 by 5–6μm, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> an {{internal}} oil drop. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 22–34 by 8–9μm. The fusiform (fuse-shaped) cystidia are colourless with oil droplets, and have dimensions of 40–50 by 7–8μm. Cap cuticle tissue {{is in the}} form of a trichoderm, where the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface. These cylindrical, interwoven hyphae contain septa.|$|E
5|$|These ants live in nests {{in sandy}} soil which <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> a mound, which resembles a molehill. M. nigrocincta ants labor to conceal their nests using twigs and leaves. Depending {{on the type}} of habitat in which the colony is located, they {{decorate}} the nest with plant material and gravel. Other materials that are used to camouflage M. nigrocincta colonies include dry leaves, rocks, vegetation, and twigs. Nests are beside a clump of grass or bush or {{at the base of a}} tree.|$|E

5|$|Cyathus olla has -shaped spores with {{dimensions}} of 10–146–8µm. In 1927, George Willard Martin examined the microscopic features of {{various members of}} the Nidulariaceae family, including Cyathus olla. He noted that in this species, the basidia—spore-bearing cells—are club-shaped or cylindrical and have long stems, and they <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> a clamp connection at the basal end of the structure. Basidia typically hold between two and four sessile spores that are directly attached to the basidium, rather than via a sterigma. Revealed only after the spore is separated, a temporary apiculus marks the point of attachment. The spores are generally separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize; this basidial breakdown typically occurs simultaneously with a gelatinization of cells lining the inside wall of the peridiole. After separating from the basidia the outer wall of the spores may thicken, although they generally do not increase in size.|$|E
5|$|Disillusioned with Covent Garden, MacMillan {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} the Deutsche Oper in Berlin to run its ballet company. Parry describes this as an unhappy experience. Though at Covent Garden Webster may <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> been suspected of favouring the opera {{at the expense of}} the ballet, MacMillan discovered that at the Berlin house there was no doubt that the ballet was given distinctly lower priority. He did not speak German, which reduced his enjoyment from watching films (of which he was a great devotee) and theatre and limited him generally in everyday life. Although he had taken several colleagues with him, including Seymour, many moved away over the course of his nearly four years in charge, and MacMillan became increasingly isolated. It was the first time he had been in a managerial as well as a creative role, and the strain affected his physical and mental health. He smoked and drank heavily and suffered a minor stroke.|$|E
5|$|If {{conditions}} are normal {{and a green}} light is shown, the athlete's coach – who is situated in a coaches' section lower down the inrun with a flag in hand – gives them the final signal to go; coaches may <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> to whistle or give a shouted confirmation in low-visibility conditions. Once given this signal, the athlete must commit to their jump within ten seconds or else risk disqualification: {{they are not allowed}} to exit the gate from whence they came. To begin descending the inrun, they drop down from the gate to a crouching position. Speed is rapidly picked up within seconds via built-in tracks, made from porcelain or ceramic, into which the skis are slotted. The athlete's streamlined crouch minimises air resistance along the inrun, and a further effort is made to reduce friction by not allowing the skis (which have wax applied to them) to bump too much against the sides of the tracks. Speed is measured from the table using a speed gun.|$|E

5|$|Juveniles {{resemble}} adults, {{but lack}} throat hackles, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> a pink fleshy gape. The bill is shorter and shallower; its base can be pinkish and the tip can be light grey. The plumage is more ruffled and softer in appearance, lacks the glossy highlights and often having a brown tinge. The bare {{skin on the}} throat is pink in bird that have recently left the nest. Eye colour varies with age, gradually lightening from juvenile to adult. Nestlings up to four months old have blue-grey irises, juveniles aged from four to fifteen months have dark brown irises, and immature birds have hazel irises with an inner blue rim around each pupil until age two years and ten months. Immature birds older than one year develop hackles, while some pink remains in the gape until the bird is {{two or three years}} of age.|$|E
5|$|L.lubrica fruit {{bodies are}} similar to those of Cudonia confusa, {{commonly}} known as the cinnamon jellybaby. The species can be differentiated by the fact that L.lubrica fruit bodies are more sturdy, and those of C.confusa are much paler in colour. Another Cudonia species, C. circinans (which is highly similar to C. lutea), is similar to L. lubrica, though it can be differentiated by its colour (which is more brown), spores (which are smaller and thinner) and texture (which is less slimy and gelatinous than L. lubrica). L. lubrica fruit bodies can also be mistaken for those of the much rarer L.atrovirens, which can be differentiated by its darker colouration. L.viscosa can again be differentiated by colouration; the species has a green head. However, as L. lubrica fruit bodies can <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> a greenish hue, differentiation between the two species is not always easy.|$|E
5|$|Shell colour is variable, from golden {{yellow to}} light yellowish-brown to grey. The {{underside}} of the shell is rarely dark; more frequently it is paler than the top, or totally white. In all cases, the shell aperture is white. Mature specimens <b>sometimes</b> <b>have</b> a metallic-grey or golden-brown gloss on {{the margin of the}} outer lip and the callus. A zigzag network of darker lines is sometimes present {{on the outside of the}} shell. The periostracum, a layer of protein (conchiolin) that is the outermost part of the shell surface, is yellowish-brown. It is usually thick, reticulated (net-like) and fimbriated (fringed) over the suture. The corneous operculum is dark brown, and its shape is fairly typical of the family Strombidae: a slightly bent sickle, with seven to eight weak lateral serrations.|$|E
