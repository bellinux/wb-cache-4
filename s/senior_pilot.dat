5|$|For Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe Hermann Göring it was {{an ongoing}} concern that {{inadequate}} numbers of fighters were able to continually engage the bomber streams, {{at the very time}} that the USAAF's 8th Air Force's new commander, Maj. Gen. Jimmy Doolittle had instituted a new fighter strategy against the Luftwaffe. Hence on 23 February 1944 — near the midpoint of the USAAF's Big Week bomber offensive against the Luftwaffe, also being carried out by the 15th Air Force flying out of Italian bases — Generalmajor Joseph Schmid Commander of I. Jagdkorps established a new rule for the fighters returning to base. They were to arrive at the nearest designated fighter airfield for resupply instead of returning to their own base. They were to be commanded by the <b>senior</b> <b>pilot</b> landing on that airfield, irrespective of their unit. This was meant to turn around the fighters in time to intercept returning bombers.|$|E
5|$|Albert Aubrey (Aub) Koch, MBE (2 October 1904 – 21 June 1975) was a {{pioneering}} Australian military and civil pilot. He trained at Point Cook in 1926, and following graduation accepted a Short Service Commission in the Royal Air Force (RAF) {{as there were}} no places available in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) at the time. After four years service in Egypt and Palestine, he returned to Australia and was commissioned into the Citizen Air Force, flying with No. 1 Squadron at Laverton, where he gained flying instructor qualifications. Soon after, he was employed by Guinea Airways as an aircraft captain, and spent five years in Papua and New Guinea (PNG), gaining fame as the rescuer of the Archbold expedition. Koch {{was transferred to the}} RAAF Active Reserve upon going to PNG. He joined Qantas a year before World War II broke out, employed predominantly on the Singapore route. He was unfortunate to be the captain of the only Qantas aircraft known to be shot down during that war, when the Short Empire flying boat Corio was lost off Timor (Circe disappeared in 1942, possibly also shot down, and Corinna was destroyed by enemy action on the water at Broome, Western Australia). Post war he was recruited by Lester Brain at the formation of Trans Australia Airlines (TAA), specifically to be <b>Senior</b> <b>Pilot</b> DC4 Skymaster. At 45, he retired from active flying to become Inspector of Safety and Accidents, TAA.|$|E

25|$|Between November 1939 and March 1940 pilot {{ratings were}} revised to the {{permanent}} three-tier system with objective standards that exists today, {{with a total}} of eight ratings overall. Graduation from Advanced Flying School was required to be rated a Pilot; ten years service and 1,800 hours of military flight for <b>Senior</b> <b>Pilot</b> rating; and either 15 years service with 3,000 hours, or 20 years service with 2,000 hours, to become a Command Pilot. For both advanced ratings, hours as a pilot or navigator (a specialization then performed only by rated pilots) were calculated at 100%, but military flight hours in any other capacity were calculated at a 50% rate. The Air Corps also divided the former Airplane Observer rating into that of Combat Observer and Technical Observer.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results on}} age dependent {{differences in the}} usage of a desktop VR system for mission planning and mission preparation in the German air force. The study investigated two tasks: one mission preparation task that demands more fluid cognitive resources like short term memory and pattern recognition; and one mission planning task in which experience {{was more important to}} complete the task. In both tasks the usage of a desktop VR system was compared to the usage of traditional media like paper maps and aerial images. In both tasks no significant interaction of age with the used media was found. However, in the mission planning task there was a weak trend that a group of <b>senior</b> <b>pilots</b> used the VR system more intensely than a group of younger pilots. In the mission preparation task pilots had to memorize and recognize objects within a target area. Response latency in identifying memorized objects of the <b>senior</b> <b>pilots</b> was significantly higher than for the tw o groups of younger pilots. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction of the factor age with the query condition within the tested scenes. The response latency of <b>senior</b> <b>pilots</b> was significantly higher when a false target had been shown in the test condition, rather than the correct target. In contrast the response latency of young pilots was equal for both query conditions...|$|R
