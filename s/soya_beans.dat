In order to know the effects of recovery growth of the late-planted <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> in maize–soya bean relay intercropping, a field experiment was carried out to observe architectural, morphological, physiological and anatomical traits of <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> plants related to shade and subsequent removal in intercropping before and after maize harvest, respectively. During shade period, <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> biomass was severely reduced, and stem elongation was stimulated. Typical features of shade grown leaves were found, such as lower LMA (leaf mass per unit area), thinner thickness, higher chlorophyll content, lower chlorophyll a:b ratio. Whole-plant leaf area analysis found that <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> increased leaf area ratio by adjusting leaf morphology rather than by dry mass allocation. After maize harvest, leaf area and leaf mass increased rapidly, contributing to compensation growth in intercropped <b>soya</b> <b>bean.</b> Meanwhile, physiological and anatomical traits of leaf went back to similar levels as grown in sole cropping. However, stem morphological traits were irreversible after removal of shade. Finally, no difference on seed weight per plant of <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> was observed between relay intercropping and sole cropping. Based on these findings, we speculated the recovery growth might be the direct determining factor on pod formation in <b>soya</b> <b>bean,</b> and improvement on the capacity of recovery growth could increase yield of relay intercropped <b>soya</b> <b>bean...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Soya</b> <b>bean</b> is {{also known}} as green manure because it can {{increase}} soil fertility level. Nowadays, agricultural fields in Indonesia has drastically lowered in number to become housing and accomodate industrial purposes. <b>Soya</b> <b>bean</b> planting using agroforestry system is considered to overcome such problems in Indonesia as well as an effort to optimize under-tree spaces (forest vegetations). <b>Soya</b> <b>bean</b> rooting system is capable of forming nodulation in which Rhizobium japonicum bacteria colonize.

Rhizobium japonicum is employed as an effort {{to increase the number of}} soil-living rhizobium bacteria which in turn provide the plant with Nitrogen and thus increase the <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> production (Freire, et. al. 1977).

The objectives of this experiment were: (1) to determine the response in growing steers to increasing levels of molassed sugar-beet pulp (MSBP) as a supplement to grass silage, (2) to compare MSBP and barley, and (3) to ascertain if there was a response to the inclusion of <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal as a protein source with both MSBP and barley. Weanling steers (n = 154) were assigned to the following treatments: (1) silage only, (2) silage plus a low level of MSBP, (3) silage plus a low level of MSBP plus <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal, (4) silage plus a high level of MSBP, (5) silage plus a high level of MSBP plus <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal, (6) silage plus a high level of barley, and (7) silage plus a high level of barley plus <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal. Low MSBP, high MSBP and barley levels were 1. 5 kg, 3. 0 kg and 3. 0 kg per head daily, respectively. Where <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal was included it replaced 0. 2 kg/day (low) or 0. 4 kg/day (high) of MSBP or barley. The duration of the treatments was 125 days (winter) after which the animals grazed together for 148 days. Silage intake decreased linearly (P < 0. 001) with increasing MSBP level. Addition of <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal had no effect on silage intake with low MSBP or barley but increased (P < 0. 05) intake with high MSBP. Live-weight gain increased both linearly (P < 0. 001) and quadratically (P < 0. 01) with increasing MSBP. There was a significant live-weight response to the addition of <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal which was greater at the high than at the low MSBP level and was greater for MSBP than barley. Across all treatments, growth rate at pasture was inversely related to growth rate in winter. Final live weights for the treatments as listed were 376, 395, 411, 400, 430, 427 and 428 (s. e. 14. 2) kg.
