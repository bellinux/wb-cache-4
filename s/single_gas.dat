Supporting this hypothesis, G1, a cloud that passed near the black hole 13 years ago, had an orbit almost identical to G2, consistent with both clouds, and a gas tail thought to be trailing G2, all being denser clumps within a large <b>single</b> <b>gas</b> stream.|$|E

The objective is to classify <b>single</b> <b>gases</b> and their mixture with a semiconductor-type electronic nose. The SVM has some typical multi-class classification models; One vs. One (OVO) and One vs. All (OVA).

We propose a hierarchical clustering method (HCM) based on the SVM for real-time gas mixture classification. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method has better performance than the typical multi-class systems based on the SVM, and that the proposed method can classify <b>single</b> <b>gases</b> and their mixture easily and fast in the embedded system compared with BP-MLP and Fuzzy ARTMAP.

The equipartition theorem may {{also be used to}} derive the energy and pressure of [...] "non-ideal gases" [...] in which the particles also interact with one another through conservative forces whose potential U(r) depends only on the distance r between the particles. This situation can be described by first restricting attention to a <b>single</b> <b>gas</b> particle, and approximating the rest of the gas by a spherically symmetric distribution. It is then customary to introduce a radial distribution function g(r) such that the probability density of finding another particle at a distance r from the given particle is equal to 4πr2ρg(r), where ρ= N/V is the mean density of the gas. It follows that the mean potential energy associated to the interaction of the given particle {{with the rest of the}} gas is ...|$|E
2500|$|Breathing gas management: The {{breathing}} {{gas supply}} must last the diver until {{out of the}} overhead environment. There are several strategies for gas management. The most common protocol is the 'rule of thirds,' in which {{one third of the}} initial gas supply is used for ingress, one third for egress, and one third to support another team member {{in the case of an}} emergency. This is a very simple method, but is not always sufficient. UK practice is to adhere to the rule of thirds, but with an added emphasis on keeping depletion of the separate air systems [...] "balanced," [...] so that the complete loss of any <b>single</b> <b>gas</b> supply will still leave the diver with sufficient gas to return safely. The rule of thirds makes no allowance for increased air consumption that the stress caused by the loss of an air system may induce. Dissimilar tank sizes among the divers are also not allowed for by the rule of thirds, and a sufficient reserve should be calculated for each dive. UK practice is to assume that each diver is completely independent, as in a typical UK sump there is usually nothing that a buddy can do to assist a diver in trouble. Most UK cave divers dive solo. US sump divers follow a similar protocol. The rule of thirds was devised as an approach to diving Florida's caves - they typically have high outflow currents, which help to reduce air consumption when exiting. In a cave system with little or no outflow it is prudent to reserve more air than is provided by the rule of thirds.|$|E

50|$|This {{technique}} {{has been used}} by many other researchers to obtain an array of one-dimensional Bose gases in the Tonks-Girardeau regime. However the fact that an array of gases is observed only allows the measurement of averaged quantities. Moreover there is a dispersion of temperatures and chemical potential between the different tubes which washes out many effects. For instance this configuration does not allow probing of fluctuations in the system. Thus it proved interesting to produce a <b>single</b> Tonks-Girardeau <b>gas.</b> In 2011 one team managed to create a <b>single</b> one-dimensional Bose <b>gas</b> in this very peculiar regime by trapping rubidium atoms magnetically in the vicinity of a microstructure.

40|$|Time-dependent {{flows of}} <b>single</b> <b>gases</b> and binary gas {{mixtures}} with various molar fractions from a chamber through a short tube into vacuum are examined by simulations and experiments. The main goal is {{the comparison of}} the flow behaviour between pure gases and binary mixtures including {{the investigation of the}} gas separation effect The simulations are based on an explicit hybrid scheme, coupling at each time step the tube flow rate estimated from a database accordingly constructed via a DSMC solver to the gas pressure in the chamber obtained by a mass conservation equation. Computational results describing the expansion process in terms of the temporal evolution of pressure in the chamber {{as well as of the}} total and species flow rates through the tube are reported. Comparison between computational and the corresponding deduced experimental pressures deduces a difference of about 10 % which may be explained by accumulation of uncertainties in the time sequence. The binary gas mixture pressure evolution curves are always bounded by the corresponding ones of the components of the mixture flowing as <b>single</b> <b>gases</b> and the tube conductance varies in the opposite direction to that of the weighted mean of the component molar masses. Gas separation is monotonically increased as we move from the viscous towards the free molecular regime, while the rate with which gas separation is increased has a maximum in the transition regime. The equivalent single as approach provides a reasonable estimate provided that the molar fraction of the light gas and the ratio of heavy to light molar mass are not too high. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
