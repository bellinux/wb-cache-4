In the early 1970s, when fish stocks ran low, a system of rotating access was developed to preserve this sector. This innovative system was part of Elinor Ostrom's research on economic governance which led to her 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics.

5|$|The Andromeda Galaxy {{is bright}} enough {{to be seen with}} the naked eye, even with some light pollution. Andromeda is best seen during autumn nights in the Northern Hemisphere, when from {{mid-latitudes}} the galaxy reaches zenith and can be seen almost all night. From the Southern Hemisphere, it is a springtime object and does not reach a high altitude over the northern horizon, thus making it difficult to observe. Binoculars can reveal <b>some</b> <b>larger</b> structures and its two brightest satellite galaxies, M32 and M110. An amateur telescope can reveal Andromeda's disk, dark dust lanes, the large star cloud NGC 206, and even some of its brightest globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|The flight muscles {{need to be}} kept at a {{suitable}} temperature for the dragonfly {{to be able to}} fly. Being cold-blooded, they can raise their temperature by basking in the sun. Early in the morning, they may choose to perch in a vertical position with the wings outstretched, while {{in the middle of the}} day, a horizontal stance may be chosen. Another method of warming up used by <b>some</b> <b>larger</b> dragonflies is wing-whirring, a rapid vibration of the wings that causes heat to be generated in the flight muscles. The green darner (Anax junius) is known for its long-distance migrations, and often resorts to wing-whirring before dawn to enable it to make an early start.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, sales {{took place}} in the {{daffodil}} fields prior to harvesting the bulbs, but today sales are handled by Marketing Boards although still before harvesting. In the Netherlands there are special exhibition gardens for major buyers to view flowers and order bulbs, <b>some</b> <b>larger</b> ones may have more than a thousand narcissus varieties on display. While individuals can visit these gardens they cannot buy bulbs at retail, which are only available at wholesale, usually at a minimum of several hundredweight. The most famous display is at Keukenhof, although only about 100 narcissus varieties are on display there.|$|E
5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} may {{be divided}} into two distinct size classes, small and large, with the large size class being about one and a half times larger than the small class, and the small class being twice as common as the large class. Both size classes lived alongside each other, and while researchers had previously suggested that they represent different species, Christopher Bennett showed that the differences between them are consistent with the concept that they represent females and males, and that Pteranodon species were sexually dimorphic. Skulls from the larger size class preserve large, upward and backward pointing crests, while the crests of the smaller size class are small and triangular. <b>Some</b> <b>larger</b> skulls also show evidence of a second crest that extended long and low, toward the tip of the beak, which is not seen in smaller specimens.|$|E
5|$|Common loons eat a {{wide range}} of animal prey {{including}} fish,crustaceans, insect larvae,molluscs, and occasionally aquatic plant life. They swallow most of their prey underwater, where it is caught, but <b>some</b> <b>larger</b> items are first brought to the surface. They are a seasonallymonogamousbreeders. Both members of a pair build a large nest out of deadmarsh grassesand other plants formed into a mound along the vegetated shores of lakes. A singlebroodis raised each year from a clutch of one or two olive-brown ovaleggswith dark brown spots which are incubated for 24 to 25 days by both parents. Fed by both parents, the chicks fledge in 70 to 77 days. The chicks are capable of diving underwater and they fly to their wintering areas before ice forms in the fall.|$|E

5|$|St Margaret's Church has a chancel, wide nave with {{a narrow}} {{clerestory}} above and narrow three-bay aisles on {{the north and south}} sides, a tall tower (topped with a spire) at the west end and a porch on the north side. The nave, chancel and chancel-arch all date from the 13th century. The aisles and their arcades are largely unaltered from their 14th-century origins: between them they feature various mouldings and designs typical of that period, including chamfered arches, octagonal columns and squinch corners. Many of the windows also date from that century, while others are a century later; trefoil-headed designs predominate, but there are <b>some</b> <b>larger</b> square-headed Perpendicular Gothic windows as well. Several other windows contain stained glass. The roof of the nave is tall and steeply pitched, with substantial king posts and tie-beams. It is also of medieval origin.|$|E
5|$|Yeasts {{have been}} used since ancient times to leaven bread and to ferment beer and wine. More recently, mould fungi have been {{exploited}} to create {{a wide range of}} industrial products, including enzymes and drugs. Medicines based on fungi include antibiotics, immunosuppressants, statins and many anti-cancer drugs. The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important model organism in cell biology. The fruiting bodies of <b>some</b> <b>larger</b> fungi are collected as edible mushrooms, including delicacies like the chanterelle, cep, and truffle, while a few species are cultivated. Mould fungi provide the meaty (umami) flavour of fermented soybean products such as tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and contribute flavour and colour to blue cheeses including Roquefort and Stilton. Moulds also yield vegetarian meat substitutes like Quorn. Some fungi, especially the fly agaric and psilocybin mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain; these in particular are the focus of academic study in the field of ethnomycology.|$|E
5|$|JNA {{artillery}} and the Yugoslav Navy resumed the bombardment of Dubrovnik between 9 and 12 November, targeting the Old Town, Gruž, Lapad and Ploče, {{as well as}} the Belvedere, Excelsior, Babin Kuk, Tirena, Imperial and Argentina hotels. Wire-guided missiles were used to attack boats in the Old Town harbour, while <b>some</b> <b>larger</b> ships at the port of Gružincluding the ferryboat Adriatic and the American-owned sailing ship Pelagic, were set ablaze and destroyed by gunfire. Fort Imperial was attacked by the JNA on 9, 10 and 13 November. These attacks were followed by a lull which lasted until the end of November when the European Union Monitoring Mission (ECMM) mediated in negotiations between the JNA and Croatian authorities in Dubrovnik. The ECMM was withdrawn in mid-November after its personnel were attacked by the JNA, and the mediation was taken over by French State Secretary for Humanitarian Affairs Bernard Kouchner and UNICEF Mission Chief Stephan Di Mistura. The negotiations produced ceasefire agreements on 19 November and 5 December, but neither yielded any specific results on the ground. Instead, the JNA 2nd Corps units located in Dubrovačko Primorje, north-west of Dubrovnik, closed in on the city, reaching the farthest point of their advance on 24 November, as the city defences were pushed back to SustjepanSrđBelvedere Hotel line. That day, the JNA tried to establish the Dubrovnik Republic in the area it occupied, but the attempt ultimately failed.|$|E

5|$|Many birds call Adams home or a {{stopover}} {{on their}} migration routes. Songbirds include three species of chickadee, two kinglets, several thrushes, warblers, sparrows, and finches. One unique songbird {{to the high}} elevations is the gray-crowned rosy finch, who can be found far up the mountain, well above the tree line. Raptors {{that live in the}} forest and meadows include Accipiters, red-tailed hawks, golden and bald eagles, ospreys, great horned owls, and falcons. The many snags around the mountain provide forage and nesting habitat for the many species of woodpeckers that live there including the hairy woodpecker, downy woodpecker, and white-headed woodpecker. Jays such as the Steller's jay and gray jay are common and the gray jay is an especially familiar character, as they will boldly investigate campers and hikers. Another familiar character of the higher elevation forests is the Clark's nutcracker with its distinctive call. Swallows and swifts are frequently seen flying just above the water of lakes and <b>some</b> <b>larger</b> streams. Common mergansers and several other species of water birds can be found on many of the lakes as well. The American dipper with its unique way of bobbing about along streams and then ducking into the water is a common sight. Several grouse species, the sooty, spruce, and ruffed grouse and the white-tailed ptarmigan, call the forests and the lower slopes of the mountain home.|$|E
5|$|This {{practice}} was replaced in 1900 by {{a far more}} complex system of assessments and donations designed {{to raise the money}} to support strikes. This system was replaced in 1901 because it was impractical. The 1901 system required every local union and the central committee to create strike funds. Local unions would receive support for strikes from Berlin under certain circumstances, and the central Business Committee's fund would be replenished by all member organizations in amounts proportional to their membership and the average wage of their members. This system, too, proved problematic because it penalized the larger, wealthier unions— especially the construction workers in Berlin who had higher wages but also higher costs of living. From 1901 to 1903, many small organizations joined the federation, yet the FVdG's membership fell as the punitive strike support system drove <b>some</b> <b>larger</b> unions out. In 1903, the federation not only changed its name to the Free Association of German Trade Unions but also decided to return to the old system of voluntary contributions. This system remained in place until 1914. The Business Committee worked to ensure that unions contributed as much as they could. Often the committee resorted to threatening unions with expulsion in order to raise funds for a strike. Fritz Kater called this a dictatorship necessary for the movement, but local organizations still had far more autonomy than their counterparts in other German labor federations.|$|E
