These limit-state functions define hyper-surfaces (referred to as limit-state surfaces) in the high-dimensional spaces of the basic random variables. The hyper-surface topology is of paramount interest, particularly in the failure domain regions with highest probability density.

Both fast probability integrators, such as first- and <b>second-order</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>methods,</b> and Monte Carlo simulation were used to determine the probabilistic characteristics of the J-integral. The same methods were used later to predict the failure probability based on initiation of crack growth. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the proposed methodology. The effects of mismatch factors on both deterministic and probabilistic response characteristics were examined. The results indicate that the tensile properties of both base and weld materials should be accounted for when calculating J. These mismatch factors have a significant effect on the probabilistic characteristics of J and failure probability. 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
