Hinde also met {{prominent}} Shawnee Blue Jacket and reported {{on him for}} the local newspapers. One <b>source</b> <b>says</b> that Hinde {{played a crucial role}} in negotiating early Indian treaties signed with the United States government, without defining his actions.|$|E
5|$|The home of John Magill {{was used}} as the polling place. The precinct only {{contained}} about 10 eligible voters (another <b>source</b> <b>says</b> 50), but the Cowboys gathered nonvoters like the children and Chinese and had them cast ballots. Not satisfied, they named all the dogs, burros, and poultry and cast ballots in their names for Shibell. The election board met on November 14 and declared Shibell as the winner.|$|E
5|$|William of Wrotham or William de Wrotham (died c. 1217) was {{a medieval}} English royal {{administrator}} and clergyman. Although a late 13th-century <b>source</b> <b>says</b> that William held a royal office under King Henry II of England (reigned 1154–1189), the first contemporary reference to William is in 1197, {{when he became}} responsible among other things for the royal tin mines. He also held ecclesiastical office, eventually becoming Archdeacon of Taunton, and served King John of England as an administrator of ecclesiastical lands and a collector of taxes.|$|E

50|$|There is some {{disagreement}} about how Agathoclia met her death. Some <b>sources</b> <b>say</b> that her mistress Paulina poured burning coals on her neck. Other <b>sources</b> <b>say</b> {{that she herself}} was cast into fire.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>sources</b> <b>say</b> that Kabir was {{a disciple}} of Ramananda. Other <b>sources</b> <b>say</b> that Ramananda {{was a student}} of Kabir. Kabir also founded a {{separate}} sect that {{is now known as}} the Kabirpanthi.|$|R
5|$|Although some in {{the front}} of the Mexican ranks wavered, {{soldiers}} in the rear pushed them on. As the troops massed against the walls, Texians were forced to lean over the walls to shoot, leaving them exposed to Mexican fire. Travis became one of the first defenders to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him, though one <b>source</b> <b>says</b> that he drew his sword and stabbed a Mexican officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury. Few of the Mexican ladders reached the walls. The few soldiers who were able to climb the ladders were quickly killed or beaten back. As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles, however, they found it increasingly difficult to reload while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling the walls.|$|E
5|$|JG 3 claimed 53 {{single-engine}} and 11 {{twin-engine aircraft}} destroyed. Five fighters and one four-engine bomber were also claimed damaged. Four Typhoons, three Spitfires, one Tempest and another unidentified aircraft were claimed shot down. All in all, JG 3 managed to destroy 43 aircraft according to British records, and damage a further 60, some seriously. The Geschwader believed it had destroyed 116. JG 3 {{did not come}} away unscathed. I./JG 3 lost nine of its aircraft and pilots, a 50% loss rate. Damage to the returning Gruppe aircraft meant the entire unit was unserviceable. RAF AAA were credited with shooting down five. JG 3 lost, altogether, 15 of the 60 fighters sent, a 25% loss rate. Some 15 pilots were missing; nine were killed and five captured, and another pilot was posting as missing in action and his fate remains unknown. Another <b>source</b> <b>says</b> 16 pilots; ten killed or missing and six captured.|$|E
5|$|On March 22, the French arrested Long in {{the coastal}} town of Phan Thiết, some 160 {{kilometres}} {{to the east of}} Saigon. His activities and proclamations had attracted the attention of French colonial officials, and just days before, the Resident of Kampot visited the Battambang temple and spotted the collection of white robes, which were similarly styled to the uniforms worn during the 1909 uprising. However, Long's disciples were unaware that he had been arrested and continued with their plot. After nightfall on March 23, the bombs were taken into Saigon and placed at strategic points, with proclamation notices being erected in close proximity. None of the bombs successfully detonated. One <b>source</b> <b>says</b> that the bombs failed because the French authorities had defused all of them after uncovering the conspiracy.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>sources</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} issue was Venceremos' belief that {{revolution}} was imminent, but Franklin says that is incorrect. Other <b>sources</b> <b>say</b> that the split {{had to do with}} ideology, with Venceremos having a more voluntarist or anarchist approach, rather than a Marxist one.|$|R
50|$|Also {{following}} {{the decision to}} not send any more cosmonauts to the station, the on-board gun was commanded by the ground to be fired; some <b>sources</b> <b>say</b> it was fired to depletion, while other <b>sources</b> <b>say</b> three test firings {{took place at the}} end of the mission.|$|R

The roots or bulbs cooked make palatable and nutritious food.|$|R
5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Penda became king in 626, ruled for 30 years, and was 50 {{years old}} at the time of his accession. That he ruled for 30 years should not be taken as an exact figure, since the same <b>source</b> <b>says</b> he died in 655, which would not {{correspond}} to the year given for the beginning of his reign unless he died in the thirtieth year of his reign. Furthermore, that Penda was truly 50 {{years old at}} the beginning of his reign is generally doubted by historians, mainly because of the ages of his children. The idea that Penda, at about 80 years of age, would have left behind children who were still young (his son Wulfhere was still just a youth three years after Penda's death, according to Bede) has been widely considered implausible. The possibility has been suggested that the Chronicle actually meant to say that Penda was 50 {{years old at the}} time of his death, and therefore about 20 in 626.|$|E
5|$|It was {{probably}} {{at some point}} during Oswald's reign that Penda fought with the East Angles and defeated them, killing their king Egric and the former king Sigebert, who had been brought out of retirement in a monastery against his will in the belief that his presence would motivate the soldiers. The time at which the battle occurred is uncertain; it may have been as early as 635, but there is also evidence to suggest it could not have been before 640 or 641. explains some of the uncertainty surrounding the time of this battle: one <b>source</b> <b>says</b> that Anna died in the 19th year of his reign, in which case his reign would have begun around 635 and therefore the battle that killed his predecessor would also have been at about the same time; however, another source indicates that the ex-king Sigebert was still alive at least in 640 or 641. Presuming that this battle took place before the Battle of Maserfield, it may have been that such an expression of Penda's ambition and emerging power made Oswald feel that Penda had to be defeated for Northumbrian dominance of southern England to be secured or consolidated.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>sources</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} quartet disbanded in 1949. Other <b>sources</b> <b>say</b> that it {{continued}} to perform {{for at least another}} ten years. The later date is supported by evidence that the violinist Frances Mason and the cellist Eleanor Warren were members of the Zorian Quartet in the 1950s.|$|R
5000|$|Some <b>sources</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} name comes from the Latin cirratus, which gave the zerrato romance, with the meaning of [...] "land {{dominated}} by rolling hills or cerrales". Other <b>sources</b> <b>say</b> {{it comes from the}} Latin serrare, in the sense of an enclosed area, fenced or cordoned off.|$|R

25|$|At {{least one}} {{contemporary}} <b>source</b> <b>says</b> {{that the commission}} was given in 1914 not 1916. If true this {{would mean that the}} models produced in 1915 were to seek approval for the design rather than as an initial proposal.|$|E
25|$|Earle {{served in}} the Rifle Brigade during the First World War, {{reaching}} the rank of captain before his discharge in 1919. In 1916 he is recorded as being on half-pay because of illness. Another <b>source</b> <b>says</b> that he {{was wounded in the}} war.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>source</b> <b>says</b> that Marpa's {{first visit}} to Niguma was {{suggested}} by Naropa and that a later visit to Niguma was suggested by Shantibhadra.

During his second visit with Niguma, he received prophecy about meeting Naropa again, even though Naropa had already died.|$|E
50|$|The Belmont Stakes {{was named}} after {{financier}} and sportsman August Belmont, Sr., who helped fund the race, and most <b>sources</b> <b>say</b> the racetrack itself was also named for him.

25|$|A legend {{about the}} moment of his death (placed somewhere between 1015 and 1025 {{depending}} on the <b>source),</b> <b>says</b> that he took with him 1200 disciples and marched off to a cave (the Bhairava Cave, an actual place known to this day), reciting his poem Bhairava-stava, a devotional work. They were never to be seen again, supposedly translating together in the spiritual world.|$|E
25|$|Having earnt $200 in a wager {{for this}} success (another <b>source</b> <b>says</b> $500), {{he began to}} seek other {{opportunities}} in the field, hoping to earn enough to open a whisky shop. He was, however, denied permission to leap from Genesee Falls, on October 20 by the Mayor of Rochester, telling a newspaper that he would join a circus and do a high jumping act. However, he attempted to jump from the bridge anyway, three days later, but was caught by police.|$|E
25|$|In 1790, Clark was {{commissioned}} by General Arthur St. Clair, governor of the Northwest Territory, as a captain in the Clarksville, Indiana militia. One older <b>source</b> <b>says</b> he was sent {{on a mission to}} the Creek and Cherokee, whom the US hoped to keep out of the war, in the Southeast. His responsibilities are unclear. He may have visited New Orleans at that time. His travels prevented him from participating in General Josiah Harmar's disastrous campaign into the Northwest Territory that year.|$|E
