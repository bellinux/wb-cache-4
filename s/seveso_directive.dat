40|$|Emergency {{response}} combines with {{prevention and}} mitigation {{to form the}} risk management triad of control measures for reducing chemical accident risks. In fact, standard good practice dictates that appropriate emergency response measures are identified for every major accident scenario of a hazardous operation. Consistent with this philosophy, emergency planning has been taken on board as {{an essential component of}} the <b>Seveso</b> <b>Directive</b> since its inception in 1982. Within the current <b>Seveso</b> <b>Directive</b> (2012 / 18 /EU), under Article 12, emergency planning for upper-tier sites is assigned as a direct obligation to both the operator (for internal emergency planning) and the authorities (for external emergency planning). These obligations present considerable challenges for the authorities, in particular, in verifying that internal emergency planning of each upper tier site is conducted in accordance with Seveso requirements and existing performance standard; that a parallel process for external emergency planning is established; and an appropriate strategy is defined to inform populations potentially at risk from the accident scenarios of concern. To bring improvements and consistency to Member State practices in this regard, the European Commission and the Irish Health and Safety Authority organised a workshop in 2012 for Seveso inspectors from EU and aligned countries to exchange information on challenges and successes in implementing emergency planning obligations.

40|$|After a {{chemical}} incident with severe consequences {{had occurred in}} the small village called Seveso in Italy in 1976, the first <b>SEVESO</b> <b>directive</b> was introduced in 1982 {{to protect the environment}} in member states of the European Union. The Directive has since been updated several times. SEVESO III will be effective from June the first 2015. The Directive expects operators of SEVESO sites to comply with the provisions in this Directive. The goal of the Directive is to prevent major incidents and to mitigate the effects of incidents that cannot be prevented. Nevertheless major incidents at these high risk sites keep occurring and it seems therefore logical to learn why these incidents occur. Is it: – because operators of these sites do not apply the provisions of the Directive as intended and/or, – because there is a conscious lack of compliance with the Directive which is not identified by the competent authority and/or, – because it is impossible to establish the desired level of fire safety with the provisions described in the Directive. The research for this thesis addresses these three aspects from various angles. The findings were used to define additional requirements for the next version of the Directive while recommendations were made for adjustments of existing guidance documents that were published to support the implementation of the Directive. The <b>SEVESO</b> <b>directive</b> has to be implemented by all member states of the European Community. An early observation during the research was that no options could be found to train as an industrial fire safety engineer at universities in the EU at the level required for these high risk sites. Perhaps this is also the reason that no previous research into industrial fire safety aspects at an academic level could be found, as such studies are often carried out at universities or in association with universities. This leaves stakeholders in industrial fire safety, lessons learned from previous incidents as well as other information in the public domain, to help identify and control these risks as anticipated in the <b>SEVESO</b> <b>directive.</b> Two studies for this thesis, one concerning heated storage of hydrocarbons in vertical storage tanks and another where the findings of the investigation into the causes of the Buncefield incident were reviewed, showed that operators and competent authorities are not keen to use lessons learned from previous accidents when assessing the risks of anticipated and existing activities at SEVESO sites. It was identified {{in the early stages of}} the research that many stakeholders with different backgrounds and qualifications are involved in establishing industrial fire safety. It was also established that fire safety can only be accomplished and maintained by going through a complex process. Complex processes can be successfully managed when the responsible organisation meets specific criteria and has the necessary tools in place. Although the elements of the Safety Management System required under the <b>SEVESO</b> <b>directive</b> are very important, they need to be stretched further before operators can control the complex fire safety aspects of these sites. Operators need to adopt specific principles for managing their SEVESO site if they want to be in control of their fire risks. Companies that have these principles securely implemented can be qualified as High Reliability Organisations (HROs). So far five principles were used by K. H. Roberts (1990) and Weick and Sutcliffe (2007 : page 9 - 17) and others to describe HR Os. Two more principles were identified as conditional requirements in this research to secure effective management of the fire risks at SEVESO sites. They are principle 6. Facilitating Communication between Stakeholders and principle 7 : Management and Exchange of Information. Access to reliable information is a precondition to establish integrated fire safety. SEVESO sites therefore have to incorporate the position of Information Manager in their organisation. This person is responsible for management and exchange of fire safety related information. He also takes on the role of the site’s fire safety Mediator who facilitates communication between the various stakeholders. The effectiveness of these seven principles HR Os was reviewed using three case studies concerning: the implementation of biofuels, the fire safety concept of large pool fires and the Buncefield incident. These case studies illustrated the potential benefits for the site’s fire safety when SEVESO establishments are operated by seven principles HROs. It is therefore recommended to make it a mandatory requirement in the <b>SEVESO</b> <b>directive</b> for operators to become seven principles HROs. Additional options to adjust the <b>SEVESO</b> <b>directive</b> and associated existing guidance documents to control fire safety at these sites more effectively in the future, were also identified through case studies and translated into recommendations. The research also showed that some risks have long been identified but finding effective measures to control these risks require extensive research and funding. A recommendation was made on how this research in the future could be organised and funded on a non-profit basis. ManagementTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|E
40|$|The term Natech {{refers to}} natural {{disasters}} triggering technological accidents. In fact, {{because of the}} interaction between the natural and the industrial risk it is possible that several effects take place in industrial plants and in the storage sites, causing for example damage to pipelines, to process equipment, to storage tanks and consequently the release of hazardous materials. There are different kinds of natural events or, in general terms, of natural causes of industrial accidents (landslides, hurricanes, high winds, tsunamis, lightning, cold/hot temperature, floods, heavy rains etc.), nevertheless in the present study the attention is focused only on seismic and flood events. In fact, several accidents occurred in the last decades in industrial sites evidenced that typology of natural phenomena may cause severe damages to equipment items, resulting in losses of containment, thus in multiple and extended releases of hazardous substances. Because of these multiple and simultaneous failures with release, cascading events are more likely to occur during a natural disaster than during normal plant operation. Some examples of natech events like the flood in the Samir refinery in Mohammedia, Morocco, in 2002 or the Kocaeli earthquake in Turkey in 1999 are available in the scientific literature or in the accident databases. In both cases the natural event occurred in a refinery and involved several storage equipment items and generated fires and explosions. These reports allow to better understand the particular severity of the industrial accidents triggered by flood and seismic events. The reference for the prevention of chemical accident in the European Commission is the <b>Seveso</b> <b>Directive</b> II (96 / 82 /EC). The aim of the <b>Seveso</b> <b>Directive</b> is Prevent Major accidents which involve dangerous substances and to limit their consequences for man and environment with a view to ensuring high levels of protection throughout Community in a consistent and effective manner. (Council Directive 1996) The <b>Seveso</b> <b>Directive</b> is addressed indirectly to Natech risk management; in fact it calls for the analysis of the external events in The identification and accidental risk analysis and prevention methods. The analysis of external events which can lead to chemical accident implies the consideration of the potential threat of natural hazards in the hazard analysis, and carrying out mitigation measures in case an accident occurs. Nevertheless the methodologies and the actions that can be taken to achieve these requirements are not specified and limited work has been devoted to the development of quantitative assessment procedures for Natech risk.

40|$|<b>Seveso</b> II <b>Directive,</b> aims at the {{prevention}} of major accidents in high risk industries, and the limitation of their consequences for human beings and environment. Although rules are well established to identify maximal hazard potential, there is no recognised method for taking into account, {{in the assessment of}} risk level, safety devices and safety management systems implemented by operators. This paper deals with the second stage of a global methodology aiming at better assessing benefits gained from safety devices and safety management systems, through accident scenarios selection. The methodology presented in this paper enables risk assessorsand competent authorities to identify Reference Accidents Scenarios (RAS), by taking into account the influence of some safety barriers, in accordance with the <b>Seveso</b> II <b>Directive</b> requirements. This method could help stakeholders involved in the public risk-based decision-making process to evaluate the safety level of high-risk establishments. Since the risk management decisions are based on the risk assessment [12], and since the choices and hypothesis to define the RAS are arbitrary, {{there is a need to}} reach a consensus among all the stakeholders to limit the discrepancy in the decision and improve the transparency.

To this end, a "severity index", which is a dimensionless measure of the risk level, is defined for each risk source and the corresponding severity maps are obtained dividing the study area into meshes and calculating {{the values of the}} severity index for each mesh. Hierarchical prioritization techniques based on expert judgement are then applied to determine the weights associated to technological and natural risk sources, which are then combined to obtain global severity maps for the study area, which can be compared with vulnerability maps to achieve an accurate picture of the risk in the study area.
