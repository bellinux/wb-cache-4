25|$|Government {{marriage}} {{officers who}} have an objection of conscience to solemnising same-sex marriages may note this objection in writing to the Minister of Home Affairs, {{and if they do}} so they cannot be compelled to solemnise same-sex marriages. (This provision does not apply to religious marriage officers because they are in any case not obliged to solemnise a marriage that would violate the doctrines of their religion.) Several constitutional scholars have argued that this provision is unconstitutional, representing as it does state-sanctioned discrimination in violation of the right to equality. In September 2016, almost a decade after same-sex marriage was legalized in South Africa, the Department of Home Affairs released a list of marriage offices across the country that are willing to solemnise same-sex marriages. According to the list, of the 409 marriage offices only 117 (or 28.6%) are willing to do so. In Gauteng, 17 out of 57 offices said they would conduct same-sex marriages, 10 out of 59 in the Eastern Cape, 5 out of 28 in the Free State, 10 out of 58 in Mpumalanga, 16 out of 61 in Limpopo, 10 out of 34 in the Western Cape, 9 out of 22 in the Northern Cape, 29 out of 68 in KwaZulu-Natal and 10 out of 22 in North West. Following its release, Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba said the list {{was just one of the}} strategies that the Department had undertaken to resolve the issue, which include increasing <b>sensitisation</b> of Home Affairs officials and ensuring that LGBT people are treated respectfully and according to policies and laws by staff.|$|E

2500|$|The {{adaptive}} value of nociception is obvious; an organism detecting a noxious stimulus immediately withdraws the limb, appendage or entire {{body from the}} noxious stimulus and thereby avoids further (potential) injury.

2500|$|Despite being {{often cited}} as a litigious country, the rate of {{litigation}} is low, [...] due to problems such as long delays, heavy expenses and meagre damage awards.

2500|$|Patients are {{frequently}} classified {{into two groups}} based upon temperature: [...] "warm" [...] or [...] "hot" [...] CRPS in one group and [...] "cold" [...] CRPS in the other group. The majority of patients (approximately 70%) have the [...] "hot" [...] type, which {{is said to be}} an acute form of CRPS. Cold CRPS is said to be indicative of a more chronic CRPS and is associated with poorer McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) scores, increased central nervous system involvement, and a higher prevalence of dystonia. Prognosis is not favourable for cold CRPS patients; longitudinal studies suggest these patients have [...] "poorer clinical pain outcomes and show persistent signs of central <b>sensitisation</b> correlating with disease progression".|$|E
2500|$|Complex {{regional}} pain {{syndrome is}} a multifactorial disorder with clinical features of neurogenic inflammation (swelling {{in the central}} nervous system), nociceptive <b>sensitisation</b> (which causes extreme sensitivity or allodynia), vasomotor dysfunction (blood flow problems which cause swelling and discolouration) and maladaptive neuroplasticity (where the brain changes and adapts with constant pain signals); CRPS {{is the result of}} an [...] "aberrant [...] response to tissue injury". The [...] "underlying neuronal matrix" [...] of CRPS is seen to involve cognitive and motor as well as nociceptive processing; pinprick stimulation of a CRPS affected limb was painful (mechanical hyperalgesia) and showed a [...] "significantly increased activation" [...] of not just the S1 cortex (contralateral), S2 (bilateral) areas, and insula (bilateral) but also the associative-somatosensory cortices (contralateral), frontal cortices, and parts of the anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast to previous thoughts reflected in the name RSD, it appears that there is reduced Sympathetic Nervous System outflow, at least in the affected region (although there may be sympatho-afferent coupling). Wind-up (the increased sensation of pain with time) and central nervous system (CNS) sensitization are key neurologic processes that appear {{to be involved in the}} induction and maintenance of CRPS.|$|E
