5|$|ILC did {{not produce}} apparel for adults until the {{introduction}} of the Living Girdle in 1940, after patenting a method of manufacturing latex girdles that would not tear at the seams if they had a small tear or hole. The Living Girdle was advertised with images of mobility and comfort, such as women playing tennis or leaping while wearing it, though the <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> girdle was actually very uncomfortable.|$|E
5|$|Box {{lacrosse}}, {{also known}} as indoor lacrosse and sometimes shortened to boxla or simply box, is an indoor version of lacrosse played mostly in North America. The game originated in Canada, where {{it is the most}} popular version of the game played in contrast to the traditional field lacrosse game. It is played between two teams of five players and one goalie each, and is traditionally played on an ice hockey rink once the ice has been removed or covered. The playing area is called a box, in contrast to the open playing field of field lacrosse. The object of the game is to use a long handled racket, known as a lacrosse stick, to catch, carry, and pass the ball in an effort to score by ultimately hurling a <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> lacrosse ball into an opponent's goal.|$|E
5|$|Field {{lacrosse}} involves two teams, each competing {{to shoot}} a lacrosse ball into the opposing team's goal. A lacrosse ball {{is made out of}} <b>solid</b> <b>rubber,</b> measuring 7.75 to 8inches (19.7–20cm) in circumference and weighing 5 to 5.25ounces (140–149g). Each team plays with ten players on the field: a goalkeeper; three defenders in the defensive end; three midfielders free to roam the whole field; and three attackers attempting to score goals in the offensive end. Players are required to wear some protective equipment, and must carry a lacrosse stick (or crosse) that meets specifications. Rules dictate the length of the game, boundaries, and allowable activity. Penalties are assessed by officials for any transgression of the rules.|$|E

50|$|Sodium {{stearate}} is {{the sodium}} salt of stearic acid. This white solid {{is the most common}} soap. It is found in many types of <b>solid</b> deodorants, <b>rubbers,</b> latex paints, and inks. It is also a component of some food additives and food flavorings.|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrogel}} implant for scleral buckling, {{first developed}} in 1980, {{is said to}} combine the advantages of both <b>solid</b> silicone <b>rubber</b> and silicone sponges. But {{it is still not}} widely used. Our clinical experience with the hydrogel implant used in 23 cases of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is described. It was used both as exoplant and implant. Anatomical success was achieved in 91 &#x 0025; of the cases. There was no infection, erosion, migration of extrusion of the buckle. The advantages are that it is soft, elastic, nontoxic, and nonpyogenic; it is devoid of infection and postoperatively it swells up, for additional heightening of the buckle. This new material appears to combine the advantages of both silicone sponge and <b>solid</b> silicon <b>rubber</b> thereby providing an ideal buckling material...|$|R
5|$|The {{motorcycle}} sidecar missile used in one chase sequence {{was built}} by film staff at Pinewood and used a standard Kawasaki Z900 and a custom made sidecar outfit. The sidecar was made large enough so that a stuntman could lie flat inside. It had two 10 inch scooter wheels on each side, a Suzuki 185 engine and the detached projectile was steered through a small <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> wheel at the front. A heavily smoked perspex nose allowed the stuntman sufficient visibility to steer the device whilst being entirely hidden from view. A pincer type lock held the sidecar in place until operated by the pilot via a solenoid switch. The sequences involving the outfit were speeded up as {{the weight of the}} sidecar made the outfit very difficult to control.|$|E
5|$|Razer's four-wheeled {{drive train}} used a skid-steering arrangement, whereby the wheels {{on one side}} of the robot rotated faster than those on the other to turn the machine. Also, the weight of the robot was biased towards the rear so that its weapon stayed facing its {{opponent}} as Razer turned. However, the <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> rear wheels used in series two provided too much traction and were reluctant to 'swing' the machine. For the third series, Razer used custom-made aluminium drive wheels which incorporated rollers, reducing the amount of force required for simultaneous forward and sideways movement. These wheels were later upgraded with a stronger titanium construction, whilst the level of oversteer in the drive system was reduced through the implementation of an electronic gyroscope. For the series Robot Wars Extreme II, Razer's rubber front wheels were replaced with metal ones bearing small spiked protrusions.|$|E
25|$|Cycle racing {{had begun}} in 1869 (Paris–Rouen), so in 1873 Truffaut lent the 18-year-old Clément an iron bicycle with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> tires to race in Angers. He {{finished}} 6th and was exhilarated to read {{his name in the}} newspapers.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA popular {{model for}} the finite element {{simulation}} of slightly compressible solid rubber-like materials assumes that the strain-energy function can be additively decomposed into a volumetric part and a deviatoric part. Based on mathematical convenience, the volumetric part is usually {{assumed to be a}} finite polynomial in the volume change. Experimental evidence suggests that for <b>solid</b> <b>rubbers</b> in compression, this polynomial can be taken to be a simple quadratic for moderate deformations and that this function also adequately models the volume change and the stress/stretch relation for materials in simple tension, up to stretches of order 100 %. For larger tensile deformations, however, experimental data suggest that the Cauchy stress-volume change relation has an increasingly large slope and therefore a truncated Taylor series expansion is not the most appropriate. A rational function approach is proposed here as an alternative...|$|R
50|$|To {{deal with}} all these early sewing problems, taping of seams was developed. The tape is a strong nylon cloth with a very thin but <b>solid</b> {{waterproof}} <b>rubber</b> backing. The tape is applied across the seam and bonded either with a chemical solvent or with a hot rolling heat-sealer to melt the tape into the neoprene.|$|R
50|$|Halobutyl rubber {{is the one}} polymer {{product made}} at Fawley. It is used to line tyres. The {{isobutylene}} feedstock for the polymers plant comes from the isobutylene plant. The <b>solid</b> halobutyl <b>rubber</b> is formed into bales and packed into crates {{in which it is}} shipped to customers around the world. The majority of tyres manufactured in Europe contain some Fawley halobutyl rubber.|$|R
25|$|A wiffle gag is {{a simple}} ball gag that replaces the {{standard}} <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> ball with a light plastic ball {{similar to the one}} used for the game of floorball. It is generally safer because there is constant airflow.|$|E
25|$|A Garford bus was {{purchased}} from New Zealand Farmers Co-op in June 1920 {{with the intention}} that it would replace the Walker electric bus on the Templeton service. Fitted with weather blinds and <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> tyres, its ride quality was no more improved {{than that of the}} vehicle it replaced.|$|E
25|$|In 1917 the Board {{purchased}} {{its first}} bus and commenced a feeder service {{from the end}} of the Sockburn tram route to Templeton. The bus was a battery-powered vehicle with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> tyres but proved to be so unreliable that it was rebuilt and converted to use a petrol engine. It was later joined by another petrol-powered bus.|$|E
50|$|Liquid {{silicone}} rubbers are supplied in barrels. Because {{of their}} low viscosity, these rubbers can be pumped through pipelines and tubes to the vulcanization equipment. The two components are pumped through a static mixer by a metering pump. One {{of the components}} contains the catalyst, typically platinum based. A coloring paste {{as well as other}} additives can also be added before the material enters the static mixer section. In the static mixer the components are well mixed and are transferred to the cooled metering section of the injection molding machine. The static mixer renders a very homogeneous material that results in products that are not only very consistent throughout the part, but also from part to part. This is in contrast to <b>solid</b> silicone <b>rubber</b> materials that are purchased pre-mixed and partially vulcanized. In contrast, hard silicone rubbers are processed by transfer molding and result in less material consistency and control, leading to higher part variability. Additionally, <b>solid</b> silicone <b>rubber</b> materials are processed at higher temperatures and require longer vulcanization times.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} develop the {{millimeter}} wave catheter irradiation apparatus for the living bode, the reflection characteristics of the samples were studied at 90 GHz using newly designed reflection measurement apparatus. Measured samples are liquid (water, glycerol and ethanol), <b>solid</b> (silicone <b>rubber,</b> Teflon and lard) and biological (cow liver and heat). Obtained refraction indices of liquid and solid are nearly equal to the values extrapolated from low frequency region (10 - 50 GHz). While, for the biological samples, the refraction indices roughly estimated...|$|R
50|$|Platform tennis is {{a similar}} sport, which was invented in 1928 in Scarsdale, New York, USA by James Cogswell and Fessenden Blanchard. The primary {{difference}} from paddle tennis is that the platform tennis court is 6 feet shorter, fenced by taut chicken wire off which the ball can be played. Platform tennis uses a <b>solid</b> sponge <b>rubber</b> ball and overhead serving is permitted. Platform tennis is popular in the Northeastern and Midwestern U.S., since the raised court (the platform) can be heated for winter play.|$|R

It is fitted with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> tires. The rims, frame, fork, and handlebars {{are made from}} hollow, steel tubing. The steel axles are mounted in adjustable ball bearings. The leather saddle is suspended by springs.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules of}} the ballgame are not known, but it was {{probably}} similar to volleyball, where {{the object is to}} keep the ball in play. In the most well-known version of the game, the players struck the ball with their hips, although some versions used forearms or employed rackets, bats, or handstones. The ball was made of <b>solid</b> <b>rubber,</b> and weighed up to 4kg or more, with sizes that differed greatly over time or according to the version played.|$|E
25|$|German-born British {{engineer}} Augustus Siebe {{developed the}} standard diving dress in the 1830s. Expanding on improvements already made by another engineer, George Edwards, Siebe produced his own design - a helmet fitted {{to a full}} length watertight canvas diving suit.

From the late 1800s and {{throughout most of the}} 20th century, most standard dress was made from a sheet of <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> laminated between layers of tan twill.|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of squeeze-out of thin liquid films between two solids {{is perhaps the}} most central topic in tribology. It is directly relevant for wear and indirectly involved in many other important processes, e. g., adhesion and friction. In this review we present a broad overview of the basic principles of squeeze-out, and present a number of applications to adhesion, friction and wear. We first describe the squeezing of 'thick' liquid films (thickness larger than ∼ 100 Å), which can be described using the Navier¿Stokes equations of hydrodynamics, and present experimental illustrations for soft <b>solids</b> (<b>rubber)</b> and hard <b>solids</b> (mica). Next we consider molecularly thin liquid films. Here the squeeze-out occurs in a quantized manner involving a monolayer at each step. We discuss the nature of the nucleation of n→ n- 1 monolayer squeeze-out, where n is the number of trapped monolayers. We consider in detail the nature of the spreading which follows the nucleation and show that the boundary line may exhibit instabilities. Sometimes the squeeze-out is incomplete, resulting in trapped islands. These islands may be pinned, or else they drift slowly to the periphery of the contact area where they get squeezed out through narrow liquid channels. We consider also dewetting at soft interfaces and present an application to the adhesion of soft objects on wet substrates. Finally, we present molecular dynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo simulation results on various aspects of squeeze-out for liquid-like and solid-like lubrication films, and discuss the implications for wear...|$|R
50|$|The M47 bomb {{can also}} be used as an {{incendiary}} device as well. A mixture of rubber and gasoline can be used in the field to produce a crude incendiary bomb. A mixture of white phosphorus and jelled gasoline also produces a flammable mixture. Other mixtures include: LA-60 in which crude latex is combined with caustic soda, coconut oil, and water, crepe rubber (CR) in which crude latex reduced to a solid by precipitation and kneading, LA-100 in which crude latex is dried until it is 100% <b>solid,</b> smoked <b>rubber</b> sheets (SR) in which crude latex that has been dried over a fire until it is 100% solid.|$|R
50|$|A white liquid called latex is {{extracted}} from the stem of the rubber tree, and contains rubber particles dispersed in an aqueous serum. The rubber, which constitutes about 35% of the latex, is chemically cis-1,4-polyisoprene ((C5H8)n).Latex is practically a neutral substance, with a pH of 7.0 to 7.2. However, when it is exposed to the air for 12 to 24 hours, its pH falls and it spontaneously coagulates to form a <b>solid</b> mass of <b>rubber.</b>|$|R
25|$|Ancient rubber {{was made}} from latex of the rubber tree (Castilla elastica), which is {{indigenous}} to the tropical areas of southern Mexico and Central America. The latex was made into rubber by mixing it with the juice of what was likely Ipomoea alba (a species of morning glory), a process which preceded Goodyear's vulcanization by several millennia. The resultant rubber would then be formed into rubber strips, which would be wound around a <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> core to build the ball.|$|E
25|$|The Taíno {{played a}} {{ceremonial}} ball game called batey. Opposing teams had 10 to 30 players per team {{and used a}} <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> ball. Normally, the teams were composed of men, but occasionally women played the game as well. The Classic Taíno played in the village's center plaza or on especially designed rectangular ball courts called batey. Games on the batey {{are believed to have}} been used for conflict resolution between communities. The most elaborate ball courts are found at chiefdoms' boundaries. Often, chiefs made wagers on the possible outcome of a game.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} {{features of}} these engines are very large rear driving wheels fitted with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> tyres, three-speed gearing (most traction engine types {{have only two}} gears), rear suspension, and belly tanks to provide a greater range between the stops needed to replenish water. All these features are to improve the ride and performance of the engine, which were used for journeys of hundreds of miles. Most road locomotives are fitted with a winch drum on the back axle. This {{can be used by}} removing the driving pins from the rear wheels, allowing the drive train to power the winch drum instead of the wheels.|$|E
40|$|Viscosity {{of field}} latex was {{determined}} with a horizontal capillary viscometer {{connected to a}} vertical reservoir tube. The flow behavior shows that the viscosity of rubber latex increased exponentially with dry rubber content (DRC). The linearrelation between viscosity and DRC was obtained when DRC is less than 8 wt%. However, further dilution seems to givemore discrepancies because of experimental errors. Therefore, the maximum DRC that {{is still on the}} linear relation should beapplied in order to minimize the experimental errors while making the effect of dissolved <b>solids</b> in <b>rubber</b> latex negligible. The viscosity of diluted latex was also checked with the rotational viscometer, which gave the confirmation that dilutioncould shield the effect of dissolved solids. The experiment showed that the efflux time method could predict the DRC well inthe range of 9 - 10 wt%...|$|R

25|$|During 1924 {{nearly half}} the fleet were {{converted}} to use pneumatic tyres (Dunlop & Michelin) instead of the earlier <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> or later Supercushion designs; by 1925 the Corporation had already determined based on both direct (price, life) and indirect (vibration damage, fuel consumption) cost comparisons, {{as well as the}} increased passenger comfort, to use them on the entire fleet. The issue of vibration was particularly serious in Edinburgh to the prevalence of granite paved streets.

25|$|Although {{occasionally}} {{mentioned as}} {{a copy of the}} French Schneider et Cie Canon de 75 Mle 1933, this connection is dubious. The Type 95 essentially utilized the Model 38 (improved) weapon with sliding-wedge type breechblock and hydropneumatic recoil mechanism on the split trail carriage used on the Type 90. This hybrid design addressed the issue of the heavy weight of the Type 90, which had created problems with field commanders, as well as the need for a simpler, more rugged design that could be transported by a team of six horses. As with the Type 90, the Type 95 was built in two versions: one with wooden wheels suitable for animal draft, and another with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> tires and a stronger suspension for towing by motor vehicles.|$|E

50|$|PDMS is viscoelastic, {{meaning that}} at long flow times (or high temperatures), it {{acts like a}} viscous liquid, similar to honey. However, at short flow times (or low temperatures), it acts like an elastic <b>solid,</b> similar to <b>rubber.</b> In other words, if some PDMS is left on a surface {{overnight}} (long flow time), it will flow to cover the surface and mold to any surface imperfections.
