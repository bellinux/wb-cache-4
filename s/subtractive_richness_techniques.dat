40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} the approximate nearest neighbour search {{problem on the}} Hamming Cube 0, 1 d. We show that a randomised cell probe algorithm that uses polynomial storage and word size dO(1) requires a worst case query time of Ω (log log d / log log log d). The approximation factor may beas loose as 2 log 1 -j d for any fixed j> 0. This generalises an earlier result [6] on the deterministic complexity of the same problem and, more importantly, fills a major gap {{in the study of}} thisproblem since all earlier lower bounds either did not allow randomisation [6, 19] or did not allow approximation [5, 2, 16]. We also give a cell probe algorithm which proves that our lower boundis optimal. Our proof uses a lower bound on the round complexity of the related communication problem. We show, additionally, that considerations of bit complexity alone cannot prove any nontrivial cell probe lower bound for the problem. This shows that the <b>Richness</b> <b>Technique</b> [20] used in a lot ofrecent research around this problem would not have helped here...|$|R

Biddle himself completed a mural titled The Tenement for the Justice Department building in Washington, D.C. and made sketches of the opera Porgy and Bess during its late 1930s tour. His works were exhibited at the 1939 New York World's Fair. During these years Biddle also wrote several books and taught at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} pressure on conservation planners to use existing data from herbarium and museum collections {{for planning and}} monitoring, despite the weaknesses of such data. It is thus important {{to be able to}} assess the quality of this information. One application of these data is the production of species richness maps. However, sampling effort is generally not consistent throughout a region for maps generated from collections data, and it is thus desirable to identify geographic grid cells (such as quarter degree squares: QDS) for which there has been low sampling effort. We describe a technique {{that can be used to}} identify QDS that are likely to have low species richness that is due to insufficient sampling effort rather than to low actual species <b>richness.</b> The <b>technique</b> exploits relationships between climate and species richness to detect QDS that are poorly sampled. This approach offers advantages over the current practice of applying a single threshold across the entire map region to detectQDSthat are poorly sampled. Here we report on the application of our technique to plant species richness data in the PRECIS database. Results reveal that the majority of QDS in the Flora of Southern Africa region can be considered to be poorly sampled, even when using conservative thresholds for richness values.

Threat Net is built on Petri nets and treats every node in the threat path as a random variable, whose values include time specific attacker profile and system defense capabilities. In theory, by computing the expected value of random events one can estimate the cost of achieving a given goal.

40|$|Fossil {{insects in}} amber are often {{preserved}} with life-like fidel-ity {{and provide a}} unique insight to forest ecosystems of the geological past. Baltic amber has been studied for more than 300 years but despite {{the large number of}} described fossil species (ca. 3500 arthropods) and abundance of fossil mate-rial, few {{attempts have been made to}} try and quantify sta-tistically how well we understand the palaeodiversity of this remarkable Fossil-Lagerstätte. Indeed, diversity estimation is a relatively immature field in palaeontology. Ants (Hyme-noptera: Formicidae) are a common component of the amber palaeobiota, with more than 100 described species represent-ing approximately 5 % of all inclusions encountered. Here we apply quantitative statistical species <b>richness</b> estimation <b>techniques</b> to Baltic amber data for the first time. We use species level data from a sample size of 12 769 specimens and conclude that around 29 % of the Baltic amber ant fauna has yet to be discovered. The species richness accumulation curve clearly reaches its asymptote at around 9650 speci-mens, indicating this as the minimum sample size required for a reasonable estimate of species richness for ants alone. Hence, it is hardly surprising that previous studies concern-ing so-called “representative ” samples of the entire palaeo-biota, consisting of at most a few thousand inclusions do not agree with each other. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to apply quantitative techniques to amber derived data and this should be the preferred approach wherever possible, rather than generating qualitative conclusions of little value for comparative purposes...|$|R

Risk maps {{summarizing}} the landscape suitability of novel areas for invading species can be valuable tools for preventing species invasions through preventive conservation plans, since avoiding future invasions is less difficult and costly {{than the control}} or eradication of already-established populations. These risk maps {{are based on the}} identification of environmental variables affecting alien species distribution. In this study, this technique, was used to establish the areas that had a higher risk of being colonized by alien species, and then overlap these areas with priority conservation zones characterized by a higher vertebrate species <b>richness.</b> GIS <b>techniques</b> and spatially explicit predictive modelling were applied to determine habitat suitability for the diversity of vertebrate alien species in Spain. Our results showed that urban land uses and the distances to big cities and some climatic variables such as Mean Diurnal Range´´, "Isothermality´´ or "Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter´´ were key features to predict the distribution of alien species. Moreover, the numbers of native and alien species were positively correlated in accordance with the acceptance hypothesis that predicts a higher number of both native and alien species when more micro niches are available. We also identified Potential Conflict Areas, which have higher values for the number of both native and predicted alien species. Many of the identified potential conflict areas coincide with protected areas, which further aggravates the problem as these areas are often home to endangered species which may be adversely affected by the emergence of alien species.

40|$|Bees {{are among}} the most {{important}} of pollinators, but little is known about their status. I expand the knowledge of the bees of the Midwest by updating the bees of Indiana, the first update in over fifty years, by adding two local bee species inventories, in the black oak savannas of northeastern Indiana and another reconstructed based on museum specimens, and by comparing two methods for sampling bees. Bees from six families, 52 genera, and 416 species are represented in Indiana, an addition of over 200 species from precious lists. Species ranged from common to rare with a median abundance of 22 specimens. Distributions, life histories, flight decade, but several species have not been collected in the last 20 - 50 years. These are mainly rare or were last collected in an area or on a host flower species which has not been sampled recently. Four bumble bee species appear to be declining and another is likely extirpated. Bees are commonly sampled either by netting at flowers or by bowl trapping. The bases of these techniques were explored while inventorying black oak savannas. Netting at flowers collected more species at any given site, but using both methods gave the best picture of species <b>richness.</b> Both <b>techniques</b> collected all common species and differed mainly in the rare species collected. Smaller bees {{were significantly more likely to}} be captured in bowls, especially within the families Halictidae and Apidae. Bowls were also more likely to catch more bees when fewer flower resources were available for bees.

40|$|Although prokaryotes {{are small}} in size, {{they are a}} {{significant}} biomass component in aquatic ecosystems and {{play a major role}} in biogeochemical processes. It is generally assumed that the relative importance of prokaryotes to material and energy fluxes is maximized in low-productivity (oligotrophic) ecosystems and decreases in high-productivity (eutrophic) ecosystems. Lagoon and coastal ecosystems are extremely dynamic, typically highly productive and dominated by macro-size organisms (both macrofauna and macrophytes). As such, their functional characteristics are typically evaluated from a "macrobial" perspective. An efficient ecosystem functioning, with fast nutrient cycling, high productivity, low C accumulation and lack of hypoxic/dystrophic crises is, however, intimately dependent on the interaction between microbial and macrobial organisms. We make here an attempt to relate prokaryote biodiversity (genotype <b>richness,</b> using fingerprinting <b>techniques,</b> ARISA) and ecosystem functioning (using a series of parameters including meiofaunal biomass, prokaryote C production and organic matter turnover rates) in different Mediterranean lagoon systems. The lagoons differed significantly with each other for all the variables. While no relationships were observed between the environmental characteristics of the lagoons and the bacterial diversity, the latter was significantly and positively correlated with the functioning and efficiency of the lagoons. The investigation of the links between microbial diversity and functioning in lagoons is still at its infancy, but these preliminary results suggest that a better understanding of the role of prokaryote diversity on ecosystem functioning and efficiency could open new perspectives for the conservation and management of these highly productive and vulnerable ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Aim  Current {{estimates}} of species richness within rapidly evolving species flocks are often {{highly dependent on}} the species status of allopatric populations that differ in phenotypic traits. These traits may be unreliable indicators of biological species status and systematists may have inconsistently assigned species among lineages or locations {{on the basis of}} these traits, thus hampering comparative studies of regional species richness and speciation rates. Our aim was to develop a method of generating standardized {{estimates of}} regional species richness suitable for comparative analysis, and to use these estimates to examine the extent and consistency of species assignment of allopatric populations within rapidly evolving cichlid fish flocks present in three east African lakes. Location  Lakes Malawi, Victoria and Tanganyika. Methods  Using published taxon co-occurrence data, a novel approach was employed to calculate standardized ‘minimum’ estimates of regional species richness for hard substrate associated complexes of cichlids within each of the lakes. Minimum estimates were based on an explicit assumption that if taxa present on equivalent habitats have disjunct distributions, then they are allopatric forms of the same species. These estimates were compared with current observed ‘high-end’ regional species richness estimates for those complexes to determine the consistency of species assignment of allopatric populations between lineages within a lake. A ‘sympatry’ index was developed to enable comparisons of levels of species assignment of allopatric populations between-lakes to be made. Results  Within each lake, the minimum and high-end estimates for species richness were significantly correlated across complexes, indicating that the complexes that contain more recognized species contain the most genuine biological species. However, comparisons of complexes among lakes revealed considerable differences. For equivalent geographical areas, substantially higher proportions of recognized species were totally allopatric within the studied Lake Malawi and Lake Victoria complexes, than those of Lake Tanganyika. Main Conclusions  Among African lakes, levels of assignment to species status of allopatric populations were found to be distinctly different. It is unclear whether the discrepancies are a consequence of differences between the lake faunas in degrees of phenotypic divergence among allopatric populations, or are simply the result of inconsistent taxonomic practices. In either case, these results have considerable wider relevance for they emphasize that quantitative measures of regional and beta diversity are critically dependent on the species status of allopatric populations, an issue usually neglected in comparative studies of species <b>richness.</b> The <b>technique</b> introduced here can be used to standardize measures of regional diversity of lineages for comparative analyses, potentially enabling more accurate identification of processes influencing rates of speciation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The need {{to control}} exotic grasses in areas of {{ecological}} restoration for long periods is followed by high economical costs of application, collateral damage on regeneration and other less obvious environmental harms. Thus, it is necessary estimate such drawbacks in order to evaluate the cost/benefit rate of the application of these techniques. This study aimed to assess {{the damage caused by}} two control techniques of Guinea-grass (Megathyrsus maximus (Jacq.) B. K Simon & S. W. L. Jacobs), on pre-existing regeneration (environmental costs) in a 20 -year reforestation site and estimate the economic costs of employing such techniques. Thirty 10 x 20 m plots were divided into three groups: (CON) control, (ROC) mowing (using gas-powered brush cutters) and (HERB) mowing followed by the application of a glyphosate-based herbicide. We did a permanent inventory of all tree and shrub individuals, who were followed over a period of one year. No differences were found in mortality imposed by the initial mowing, neither in the mortality imposed exclusively by mowing nor in the mortality imposed exclusively by herbicide in HERB. After one year, there were no differences between mortality and species richness of the three groups. However, when the three groups were compared with themselves after one year, for plants > 1 m, we found a reduction on abundance in CON and reduction in species richness in HERB; whereas for plants < 1 m, ROC showed a reduction in abundance and HERB showed reduced abundance and species <b>richness.</b> Therefore, both <b>techniques</b> seem to affect more plants < 1 m (i. e., regeneration). The final economic cost of ROC was 34. 1 % bigger than the cost of HERB, and in spite of a likely reduction in costs to perform new interventions, proportional costs increased for scattered interventions over small areas. Both techniques were efficient to control Guinea-grass, but the use of glyphosate-based herbicide should be restricted to areas with low canopy cover, more maintenance-demanding sites, once the technique is more damaging on regeneration, since there was high mortality (73 %) of individuals < 1 m in areas with dense grass infestation (100 %) ...|$|R
