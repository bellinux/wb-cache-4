5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E
5|$|After {{intercontinental}} compatibility tests, Petersen and Bermudes {{suggested that}} bioluminescence and compatibility were independent since bioluminescence <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> geographically restricted. This {{suggested that the}} ability or potential to interbreed must have been preserved since separation of P.stypticus into geographically isolated areas.|$|E

5|$|Ann's mother {{remarried}} in 1760; {{she and her}} {{new husband}} Anthony TenEyck (1712–1775) had one daughter, Susanna TenEyck (1776-?).

5|$|Early episodes {{revealed}} Grissom to be a witty, enthusiastic, and quirky {{scientist who}} had some sense of humor. He flirted regularly and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> constantly in a hyperactive state.|$|E
5|$|Sejanus was {{so great}} a person by reason both of his {{excessive}} haughtiness and of his vast power, that, to put it briefly, he himself <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the emperor and Tiberius a kind of island potentate, inasmuch as the latter spent his time {{on the island of}} Capreae.|$|E

5000|$|The list of affects {{does not}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> complete, however. One affect which <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{missing from the}} list is humor. This affect also has highly {{characteristic}} facial expressions. Humor <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a response <b>to</b> a conflict between negative and positive affects, [...] such as fear and enjoyment, which results in spasmodic contractions of parts of the body, mainly in the stomach and diaphragm area, as well as contractions in the upper cheek muscles. Further affects which <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> missing include relief and confusion.|$|R

5|$|The {{second major}} {{division}} of the ancestral Pawnees was the Southern, or Black Pawnees. Their migration history is not well documented; but by 1750 they, with the related and allied Wichitas, had established what <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a secure territory on the Arkansas River.|$|E
5|$|There were 10 gunmen, nine of {{whom were}} {{subsequently}} shot dead and one captured by security forces. Witnesses reported that they <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in their early twenties, wore black T-shirts and jeans, and that they smiled and looked happy as they shot their victims.|$|E
5|$|When Bolognesi was re-writing the screenplay, Bodanzky {{suggested}} that he listen to Arnaldo Antunes' music. According to the writer, he found some songs that <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> composed for the film. He then wrote some scenes and characters to fit the compositions and integrate them into the narrative.|$|E
5000|$|That's part of {{what the}} song's about, really. The fact that they videos <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taking over almost from the aural side, the visual side <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> almost more important.|$|R
30|$|In {{the group}} of {{adolescents}} without binge eating, trait anxiety <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> related <b>to</b> perfectionism (t =  2.63; p = . 01; β = . 60) and interoceptive awareness (t =  2.86; p = . 007; β = . 58). In this group, the neuroticism <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more relevant <b>to</b> perfectionism (t =  3.16; p = . 003; β = . 59), interpersonal distrust (t = − 2.17; p = . 04; β = . 37) and social insecurity (t =  2.56; p = . 01; β = . 47), while the extraversion <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> negatively related only to interpersonal distrust (t = − 2.21; p = . 03; β = . 34). Moreover, impulsivity <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> related <b>to</b> impulse regulation (t =  2.37; p = . 02; β = . 39).|$|R

5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill {{from the edge}} of the water and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{smearing}} it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} of the hazard maps {{published}} in the prominent El Espectador newspaper in Bogotá included glaring errors. Without proper graphic scaling, it was unclear how big the map's hazard zones really were. The lahars on the map did not have a distinct ending point, and the main threat <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> from pyroclastic flows, not from mudflows. Though the map was colored blue, green, red, and yellow, there was no key to indicate what each color represented, and Armero was located in the green zone (believed to indicate the safest area.|$|E
5|$|Both Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus where {{discovered}} {{during the}} 1965 joint Polish-Mongolian expedition. Before the remains were prepared and described, the expedition crew believed both finds {{to belong to}} the same species of sauropod. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka deemed Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus to represent separate genera because Nemegtosaurus was at this time considered {{to be a member of}} the Dicraeosauridae, while Opisthocoelicaudia <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a representative of a different group, the Camarasauridae.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the palace was destroyed, {{separation}} of crown and state had become important, with Parliament being necessary to control military requirements and pass laws.

5|$|Celtic again {{qualified}} for the UEFA Champions League for the 2013–14 season, and again played against Barcelona at Parkhead on 1 October 2013, losing 1–0. Despite the defeat, Forster again impressed with several excellent saves, in particular an outstanding double save {{near the end of}} the match. Forster also pulled off a crucial save during a 2–1 win on 22 October 2013 over Ajax at Parkhead, saving from Thulani Serero when he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> clean through on goal.|$|E

5|$|Field's {{failure to}} secure {{independence}} concurrently {{with the end}} of the Federation caused his Cabinet's support for him to waver during late 1963 and early 1964. The RF caucus in January 1964 revealed widespread dissatisfaction with him on the grounds that the British <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> outwitting him. The Prime Minister was put under immense pressure to win the colony's independence. Field travelled to England later that month to press Douglas-Home and Sandys for independence, and raised the possibility of UDI on a few occasions, but returned empty-handed on 2 February.|$|E

All {{the agony}} of the {{disintegration}} of his government was gone, and he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a giant revived by his contact with the people.

Even such loyalists as Gordon Churchill had to stick close to their own bailiwicks, where they were fighting for their political lives.|$|E
