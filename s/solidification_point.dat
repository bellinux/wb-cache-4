Because {{the dynamic}} soft {{reduction}} of continuous casting process {{is based on}} the computation of the <b>solidification</b> end <b>point,</b> using model to simulating the steel solidificating process is more and more interesting. Especially, the influence of the heat flux to the <b>solidification</b> end <b>point</b> is needed to research thoroughly. In this paper the heat transfer model for the simulation of the solidification of steel droplet is established. The simulation reveals that the steel droplet (the radium is 7. 2 mm) is solidified quickly in 4. 3 seconds on water cooling copper plate, and in 3 seconds there is half of the droplet is frozen to solid. If there are materials resisting heat transfer inserted between cooling plate and liquid steel, the solidification end position would be moved to the deeper place below the shell in obvious extent, and the influence of heat flux to the ratio of mushy zone is weaker than that to <b>solidification</b> end <b>point</b> position...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{continuous}} casting process is controlled automatically because various sensors and control unitsare {{connected to the}} mold and lower tundish roll. The <b>solidification</b> <b>point</b> in the process has a major factor onthe quality of products, but the point has been predicted depending on the inaccurate calculated results from acomputer simulation until now. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} paper is to develop the EMAT sensors for themeasurement of the <b>solidification</b> <b>point</b> made by a through transmission technique based on the relationshipbetween ultrasonic speed and measured temperature. Design/methodology/approach: The EMAT sensor is composed of an Elongated Spiral (ES) forming an eddycurrent and a permanent magnetic core generating a static magnetic field. ES coils of the sensor to measure 0. 08 mm, 0. 2 mm and 0. 45 mm as solidification points were employed respectively. Probes for receiving andtransmitting which included 4 permanent magnets measuring 5 × 5 × 10 mm, were placed together in one unit. Each coil was used to magnetic cores measuring 0. 08 mm and 0. 45 mm wound around it forty three times. TheAI 75 × 75 mm and 75 × 100 mm simulators to identify whether the <b>solidification</b> <b>point</b> can be detected using anEMAT sensor, were machined with 2 mm, 4 mm, 8 mm, 16 mm and 32 mm holes in diameter respectively.

Design/methodology/approach: An EMAT (Electro Magnetic Acoustic Transducer) has been designed and fabricated with an elongated spiral coil and a permanent magnetic core. Al 75 × 75 mm and 75 × 100 mm simulators with 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 mm holes were produced and demonstrated that the location of the final <b>solidification</b> <b>point</b> during the continuous casting process can be monitored using a 1. 0 MHz frequency.

It is significative to {{link the}} {{semi-solid}} process and continuous roll-casting process (CRP), through which we can get high quality magnesium alloy strips with non-dendritic structure and improve the overall properties of the products. Furthermore, because CRP of semi-solid metal combines casting and forming, it shortens the period of technological process. In general, several technical parameters such as the inlet temperature of semi-solid slurry, the heat transfer between roll and molten alloy, the roll-casting speed, the position of <b>solidification</b> final <b>point</b> influence on the strip quality in continuous roll-casting process.

40|$|A new {{conceptual}} framework {{has been developed}} which explains the formation of shear-related casting defects such as porosity, segregation and tears. The theory relates defect formation to the mechanical behaviour of the partially solidified microstructure when shear stresses are developed during the filling of a casting and by the subsequent feeding processes during <b>solidification.</b> Two transition <b>points,</b> the dendrite coherency point and the maximum packing solid fraction, divide the mushy zone into three regions of different mechanical and feeding behaviours. The response of the mush to shear {{is related to the}} presence of these zones during solidification of a casting. The resulting defects are rationalized by considering the governing local shear stress and shear rate, local strength and time available for fluid flow. The design of the casting, the casting process used and the alloy composition all influence the relative importance of shearing on defect formation. (C) 1998 Acta Metallurgica Inc.

The intention is twofold: On the one hand, modelling of dislocation dynamics {{is a very}} recent field of development in phase-field theory, {{in comparison to the}} simulation of diffusional phase transformation and related micro-structure evolution problems in materials science. The reason is that modelling dislocation dynamics poses several challenges for phase-field concepts which go beyond purely diffusional problems in materials science as, e. g., dendritic <b>solidification,</b> as we <b>point</b> out in Sect. 3. On the other hand, the modelling of dislocations has triggered further wide-ranging developments of phase-field based models for deformation problems.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{consider}} {{the approach to}} equilibrium of quenched systems with continuous symmetry, whose relaxational dynamics is dominated by topological defects. The general aspects {{of the problem and}} relevant theoretical, numerical and experimental results from the literature are discussed in chapter 1. In chapters 2 and 3, I report the results of two and three dimensional simulations of a simple model with non-conserved order parameter and the symmetry of a planar ferromagnet. A transient behavior is observed at early times in two dimensions, indicating that the vortex annihilation dynamics significantly affects the initial ordering process in the system. Finite-size scaling of the scattering function is demonstrated and it is shown that dynamical scaling is satisfied not only by the correlation functions of the order parameter but also by the correlation functions of the defects (point-vortices in two dimensions and vortex-strings in three dimensions). In the three dimensional case, the effect of a bias in the initial conditions is considered. The introduction of a bias (or external field) leads to exponential relaxation and the break-down of dynamical scaling. An experiment is suggested, which could reproduce the conditions of the simulation in bulk samples of quenched nematic liquid crystals. Possible relevance to superfluids systems is also discussed. In chapter 4, I consider a system with conserved order parameter, which is proposed as a model of crystal surface relaxation. The observed value for the growth of order in the system is in agreement with arecent theoretical prediction. Multiscaling behavior for the scattering function is investigated, with negative results. A comparison of the correlation functions in the conserved and non-conserved case indicates that, while the conservation constraint does not influence the structure of the vortex defects, it significantly affects their dynamics. In chapter 5, I discuss a model of the superconducting transition. A linear stability analysis of the normal-superconductor interface for type I superconductors is presented. The presence of an instability analogous to that responsible for dendritic patterns in <b>solidification</b> is <b>pointed</b> out. Numerical simulations of the phase propagation in type I superconductors confirm the indications of the linear stability analysis. A simple mean-field picture of the transition kinetics of type II superconductors suggests the existence of two dynamical regimes, characterized by a power-law and a logarithmic growth of ordered (superconducting) domains in the. system. These two regimes can be understood in terms of the spatial dependence of the vortex-string interaction. Numerical simulations of type II superconductors in the spinodal regime bear out this prediction, confirming that the quenched dynamics of this system is well described by the effective interaction among the defects.

The shallow minimum and associated narrow freezing ranges around the congruent point result in a completely cellular (non-dendritic) solidification morphology for a composition range ~ 3 wt % Mn about the congruent composition (C c). The degree of cellular solidification was found to depend on the mold material. Increased mold conductivity lead to a narrower composition range of complete cellular solidification. By casting alloys of different compositions into a composite mold, the effect of the mold conductivity allowed an evaluation of the congruent point reported by Gokcen. These results fit well with the constitutional supercooling criterion. While <b>solidification</b> at a <b>point</b> ideally would be planar, this was not observed even with minor deviations from the Cc. An additional study of the microstructure development along the minimum trough in the liquidus surface between the Cu-Mn and Ni-Mn binary congruent points of the Cu-Mn-Ni ternary system was conducted. This study revealed that alloys near the binary congruent minima were more cellular than alloys near the middle of the phase diagram, along the trough. As the composition approached the center of the Cu-Mn-Ni diagram, the morphology became more dendritic, characteristic of an isomorphous system. Even though these alloys did not solidify in a completely cellular manner, they were free of any microshrinkage porosity. The alloys in this study (Cu-Mn and Cu-Mn-Ni) show promise for use in structural applications {{due to the lack of}} microshrinkage porosity, potent solution strengthening of manganese and strong aging response. ...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} heterogeneous nucleation of solidification of metals and alloys {{by a combination of}} differential scanning calorimetry and transmission electron microscopy using a newly modified entrained particle technique. Attention is focused on investigating (a) heterogeneous nucleation of Cd, In and Pb particle solidification by Al in rapidly solidified Al-Cd, Al-In and Al-Pb binary alloys; (b) effects of various ternary additions such as Mg, Ge and Si on heterogenous nucleation of solidification of Cd and Pb solidification by Al; (c) heterogenous nucleation of solidification of Si by solid Al in hypoeutectic Al-Si alloys. In addition, the melting behaviour of Cd, In and Pb particles embedded in an Al matrix is investigated. The rapidly solidified microstructures of melt spun Al-Cd, Al-In and Al-Pb alloys consist of faceted 5 - 200 nm diameter Cd, In and Pb particles homogeneously distributed throughout an Al matrix. Cd particles exhibit an orientation relationship with the Al matrix which can be described as { 111 } Al //{ 0001 } Cd and andlt; 110 andgt; Al //andlt; 112 and# 773; 0 andgt; Cd, and In and Pb particles exhibit a near cube-cube and cube-cube orientation relationship with the Al matrix respectively. Cd, In and Pb particles embedded in the Al matrix exhibit distorted truncated octahedral or truncated octahedral shapes surrounded by { 111 } Al and { 100 } Al facets. The solid Al-solid Cd, solid Al-solid In surface energy anisotropies are constant over the temperature range between room temperature and Cd and In melting points respectively. The solid Al-liquid Cd and solid Al-liquid In surface energy anisotropies decrease with increasing temperature above Cd and In melting <b>points.</b> <b>Solidification</b> of Cd, In, Pb particles embedded in an Al matrix is nucleated catalytically by the surrounding Al matrix on the { 111 } Al faceted surfaces with an undercooling of 56, 13 and 22 K and a contact angle of 42 °, 27 ° and 21 ° for Cd, In and Pb particles respectively. Addition of Mg to Cd particles embedded in Al increases the lattice disregistry across the nucleating plane, but decreases the undercooling before the onset of Cd(Mg) particle solidification. Addition of Ge to Al decreases the lattice disregistry across the nucleating plane, but increases the undercooling before the onset of Pb particle solidification embedded in the Al(Ge) matrix. These results indicate that chemical interactions dominate over structural factors in determining the catalytic efficiency of nucleation solification in Al-Cd-Mg and Al-Pb-Ge alloys. Contact between Si precipitates and Pb particles embedded in an Al matrix decreases the undercooling before the onset of Pb particle solidification. The equilibrium melting point of Cd particle in the melt spun Al-Cd alloy is depressed because of capillarity, and the depression of equilibrium melting point increases with decreasing particle size. In the melt spun Al-In and Al-Pb alloys, however, most of the In and Pb particles embedded within the Al matrix grains are superheated, and the superheating increases with decreasing particle size. The heterogeneous nucleation temperature for Si solidification by Al depends sensitively on the purity of the Al. Na and Sr additions have different effects on the Si nucleation temperatures. With an Al purity of 99. 995 %, Na addition increases the Si nucleation temperature, while Sr addition does not affect or decreases the Si nucleation undercooling, depending on the amount of Sr addition. The solidified microstructure of liquid Al-Si eutectic droplets embedded in an Al matrix is affected by the Si nucleation undercooling. With low Si nucleation undercooling, each Al-Si eutectic liquid droplet solidifies to form one faceted Si particle, however, with high Si nucleation undercooling, each Al-Si eutectic liquid droplet solidifies to form a large number of non-faceted Si particles embedded in Al. </p...|$|R
