5|$|As Romulus was {{an alleged}} usurper, Julius Nepos claimed to hold legally {{the title of}} the emperor when Odoacer took power.

5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of {{successful}} plays, Planché was never particularly wealthy, and he felt pressure from needing to <b>support</b> <b>his</b> grandchildren.

Planché died {{at his home in}} Chelsea on 30 May 1880 at the age of 84. His wealth {{at the time of his}} death was under £1000.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{relationship}} existed between Zahir and the Shia Muslim peasants of Jabal Amil and their sheikhs. Zahir maintained {{law and order}} in Jabal Amil, while leaving its mostly Shia inhabitants to their own devices. The Shia also benefited economically from Zahir's monopoly of the cotton industry and their sheikhs provided him men of great military skill to <b>support</b> <b>his</b> struggle against the Ottoman authorities. Zahir was a key backer of the Shia in their war with the Druze Jumblatt clan and the Shihab dynasty under Mulhim Shihab, and likewise, Shia forces were critical to the defense of Zahir's sheikhdom against expeditions by the Ottoman governor of Damascus in 1771 and 1772.|$|E

5|$|Abd al-Rahman at {{this time}} was a {{flamboyant}} figure with broad popular <b>support.</b> <b>His</b> stature served to diminish that of the politicians, who were seen as his followers rather than as leaders. Abd al-Rahman could not afford a sudden British withdrawal, since that would {{open the door for}} an Egyptian take-over and the loss of his power. The British also were against an Egyptian take-over, but for different reasons. Yet Abd al-Rahman could not be seen as supporting an indefinite colonial status, and continued to promote independence. Abd al-Rahman and the British were engaged in delicate and unstable arrangements characterized by mutual distrust.|$|E
5|$|After Alfred's {{death in}} 899, Æthelwold disputed the throne with Alfred's son, Edward the Elder.

He attempted to raise an army to <b>support</b> <b>his</b> claim, {{but was unable to}} get sufficient support to meet Edward in battle and fled to Viking-controlled Northumbria, where he was accepted as king. In 901 or 902 he sailed with a fleet to Essex, where he was also accepted as king.|$|E

The southwestern section, known as the Ilkhanate, was {{under the leadership of}} Genghis Khan's grandson Hulagu. He continued to <b>support</b> <b>his</b> brother, the Great Khan, and was therefore at war with the Golden Horde, {{while at the same time}} continuing an advance towards Persia and the Holy Land.|$|E
