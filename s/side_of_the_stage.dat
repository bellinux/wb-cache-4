5|$|The {{audience}} is seated {{in front of}} the stage, to the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> and in the corner front-left of stage; these are in order of decreasing desirability. While the metsuke-bashira pillar obstructs the view of the stage, the actors are primarily at the corners, not the center, and thus the two aisles are located where the views of the two main actors would be obscured, ensuring a generally clear view regardless of seating.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Stackpole {{received}} {{a commission to}} sculpt his interpretation of Colorado River explorer John Wesley Powell, for display in the Main Interior Building of the U.S. Department of Interior. It {{was to be a}} companion piece to Heinz Warneke's portrayal of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Warneke learned that Stackpole intended a water scene, so he changed his portrayal of Lewis and Clark {{to be one of them}} on land. Stackpole and Warneke delivered their stone reliefs in 1940, and the two panels were mounted on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> of the building's auditorium.|$|E
5|$|The Front of the Stage is open'd, and the Band of 24 Violins, {{with the}} Harpsicals and Theorbo's which {{accompany}} the Voices, are plac'd between the Pit and the Stage. While the Overture is playing, the Curtain rises, and discovers a new Frontispiece, joyn'd {{to the great}} Pylasters, on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stage...</b> Behind this is the Scene, which represents a thick Cloudy Sky, a very Rocky Coast, and a Tempestuous Sea in perpetual Agitation. This Tempest (suppos'd to be rais'd by Magick) has many dreadful Objects in it, as several Spirits in horrid shapes flying down amongst the Sailers, then rising and crossing in the Air. And when the Ship is sinking, the whole House is darken'd, and a shower of Fire falls upon 'em. This is accompanied with Lightning, and several Claps of Thunder, {{to the end of}} the Storm.|$|E

5000|$|To {{an actor}} facing the audience, [...] "left" [...] and [...] "right" [...] are <b>the</b> reverse <b>of</b> {{what they are}} for the audience. To prevent confusion, actors and {{directors}} never use the unmarked terms left or right for <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> Rather, they use a phrase specifying the viewpoint. The terms [...] "stage left" [...] and [...] "stage right", respectively, denote <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> {{that are on the}} actor's left and right when the actor is facing the audience, while [...] "house left" [...] and [...] "house right" [...] are the reverse, denoting <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> as viewed by the audience. In Germany, stage right and left are reversed, being the director's view rather than the actor's.|$|R
25|$|This is a {{movement}} in which two performers move in a cross-over fashion to opposite <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|R
5|$|The sound {{equipment}} {{was provided by}} Showco who used the PRISM system, which adapted the show for each venue according to its height, width and the coverage required. The sound was mixed by Front of house engineer Monty Lee Wilkes {{on a combination of}} Yamaha PM4000 and PM3000 consoles, an unusual choice for Spears's shows. He used dbx 903 compressors for kick and snare drums. The compressors were also used on Spears's microphones, a Shure Beta 58A handheld and a Crown CM-311AE headset-mounted capsule. Spears's vocals were mostly liveâ€”pre-recorded vocals ran in parallel on an ADAT machine during the shows, and were used to replace her live microphone when the dance routines became too energetic for good voice control. Spears's band, backline technicians and monitor engineer Raza Sufi were all fitted with in-ear monitors and headset mics, enabling rapid and clear communications around the stage area. Spears did not use them, preferring the ambient sound of a battery of eight Showco SRM wedges spread across the downstage area. These were augmented by Showco SS full-range sidefills and a pair of one-by-18-inch subs on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> Sufi also used a dbx 160A to limit Spears's louder moments, while backing vocalists were controlled by a duo of BSS DPR901 dynamic equalizers. Effects were limited to vocal and drum reverbs. Amplification for the wedges and the FOH system were all Crown-based, with a pair of drum stool shakers completing the line-up. All the cables used during the tour were brought from the US, even in Europe, something unusual in audio production.|$|E
25|$|Volants (Scarabs): Using two trapezes {{on either}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> the scarabs are thrown onto a {{platform}} suspended above {{the centre of}} the stage where they are caught and thrown in a banquine style discipline. This act was replaced by aerial cradle during the arena conversion in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Using the set, costumes, performers, {{and other}} {{resources}} from the recently closed third US national touring production, the production was only slightly altered. Minor changes included colourful projections blended into its existing lighting design, and a proscenium that extended out into the first two boxes on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E
50|$|The horseshoe-shaped {{auditorium}} {{originally had}} {{a capacity of}} 5,000. Due to poor sight lines along <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> nearly 600 seats were removed (or never used), reducing maximum seating to 4,404.|$|R
50|$|A {{traverse}} {{stage is}} a form of theatrical <b>stage</b> in which <b>the</b> audience is predominantly on two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> facing towards each other. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> is also commonly known as an alley or corridor stage.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> wings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> were {{screened}} {{with a heavy}} planting of forsythia and other shrubbery, which were transplanted from <b>the</b> shores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tidal Basin into beds along <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> <b>The</b> entire area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theater <b>stage</b> was covered with soil and seeded and sodded to ensure a good turf for the opening performance which took place on June 2, 1917.|$|R
25|$|On Maundy Thursday 1708 (5 April) the {{building}} opened as a Catholic church, which {{was dedicated to}} the Heiligste Dreifaltigkeit (Most holy Trinity). The west side of {{the building}}, previously the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> held a choir balcony, which already contained a small organ in 1709. Gottfried Silbermann built an organ in 1720.|$|E
25|$|Large {{circular}} ramps {{on either}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> led {{down to the}} basement, which was designed for the building of sets. The sets would be rolled up one ramp to the stage and then down the other ramp after use. Today only one ramp remains in use, and the basement is occasionally used as a black box theater.|$|E
25|$|Khon is {{the most}} stylized form of Thai dance. It is {{performed}} by troupes of non-speaking dancers, the story being told by a chorus at the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> Choreography follows traditional models rather than attempting to innovate. Most khon performances feature episodes from the Ramakien. Costumes are dictated by tradition, with angels, both good and bad, wearing coloured masks.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, The Hawai'i Shakespeare Festival (HSF) {{presented}} an anime/video game style production that was notable for using dancers as stand ins for King Edward and King John as they controlled the dancers from <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2009 many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{paintings}} {{had been}} restored or repainted. In 2009, plans included replacing {{a pair of}} tall columns that were on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> using blueprints obtained from Wetherell Ericsson Architects in Des Moines, Iowa.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> three-story <b>stage</b> runs {{parallel}} to the midway. <b>The</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> is [...] high and the length is [...] long. Several screens are located on behind <b>the</b> main <b>stage</b> with two showing close-ups <b>of</b> <b>the</b> performers on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> has video walls made of one-hundred twelve MVP 18 and thirty-seven MVP 37.5 modular video panels. Two screens are next to the control booths and bleachers.|$|R
25|$|In 1956 {{no public}} votes were presented: a closed jury simply {{announced}} that Switzerland had won. From 1957 to 1987, the points were {{displayed on a}} physical scoreboard to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> As digital graphic technology progressed, the physical scoreboards were superseded in 1988 by an electronic representation which could be displayed on the TV screen at {{the will of the}} programme's director.|$|E
25|$|Since 1996, Lee {{no longer}} uses {{traditional}} bass amplifiers on stage, opting {{to have the}} bass guitar signals input directly to the touring front-of-house console, to improve control and balance of sound reinforcement. Faced with the dilemma {{of what to do}} with the empty space left behind by the lack of large amplifier cabinets, Lee chose to decorate his <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> with unusual items.|$|E
25|$|Mid- to large-size {{performing}} venues typically route the onstage {{signals to}} two mixing consoles: {{the front of}} house (FOH), and the stage monitor system, which is often a second mixer at the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> In these cases, at least two audio engineers are required; one to do the main mix for the audience at FOH and another to do the monitor mix for the performers on stage.|$|E
50|$|Often {{affixed to}} battens {{flown in from}} the fly tower or loft for the scenes {{in which they are}} used, they may also be stored at <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> called wings, and braced to the floor when in use for an entire performance.|$|R
5|$|Sea Travel: The second segment {{focuses on}} <b>the</b> Seas. Sounds <b>of</b> {{crashing}} waves can be heard. Waves and different fish and {{animals in the}} ocean {{can be seen on}} the screens. Cirque performers dressed as Sea Sirens are on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> Performers use sails at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> this segment.|$|R
5000|$|Director Fritz Lang {{said the}} story [...] "calls for mood, for atmosphere. The smugglers {{work in the}} dark, on hazy days. I plan to light my {{principals}} {{just as you would}} in a play, dropping shadows on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> to concentrate on the main action and the players involved in it." ...|$|R
25|$|Michael Evans (main character): Michael {{does not}} appear onstage as a child, but his {{presence}} is alluded to by the other characters, while the adult Michael speaks his lines from the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> As a child, Michael is seen as being surrounded by love, since all five of the sisters dote on him. Michael also acts as a narrator, not only dictating the action as it goes on, but revealing the futures of the other characters in the play.|$|E
25|$|The troupes {{orchestra}} {{would be}} made up of such instruments as the trumpet, trombone, violin, trap drum and cymbals. The orchestra would start to play popular songs of the day and marches in front of the theatre about an hour before the show to drum up interest. This intermission or Antrak music ended up with the well-known Izmir March, a sign that the show time was approaching. The play began as the musicians went in and took their places at the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E
25|$|Eight private boxes, four on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> {{and each}} {{accommodating}} six people, rounded out the seating, the box seats furnishing {{the most elegant}} and expensive accommodations in the house. At the time the theatre opened in 1871, seating in the family circle cost fifty cents and the dress circle cost a dollar. In the lower auditorium, parquet seating, inconveniently close to the stage, cost seventy five cents while the parquet circle cost a dollar fifty. The box seats cost ten dollars.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> also {{features}} a self-supporting hydraulically powered back stage, which slides forward on two tracks, covering the space left in <b>the</b> central <b>stage</b> when <b>the</b> decks are lowered. On both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> covering a wider area than <b>the</b> central <b>stage,</b> two floors are equipped with lightweight mobile wagons to carry sets onto centre stage.|$|R
50|$|Another {{interlude}} plays while inflatable roses {{rise from}} <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> up to <b>the</b> ceiling. Gomez enters on an Latin-type carriage (wearing a gold leotard) and performing 'Me & My Girls', transitioning into 'Me & The Rhythm'. She then performs 'Body Heat' with her dancers, before {{getting on the}} carriage and leaving for a final costume change.|$|R

25|$|The {{band was}} backed by both an six-member {{instrumental}} band and a complement of ten backup dancers (five male and five female). The band would sometimes split up and perform with one member to each side or corner of the stage, but {{for much of the}} show, they performed to one side at a time, circling the stage (often as part of the choreographed dancing) throughout each song. The backup dancers sometimes performed for opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> as the band. A video feed of the show was shown on video screens circling the overhead lighting rig.|$|E
25|$|Responding {{within three}} minutes to a {{dispatch}} call made at 10:15pm, seven police officers entered through the front entrance and moved toward the stage. Officer James Niggemeyer came in through the back door, behind the stage. Gale only saw the officers {{in front of the}} stage; he did not see Niggemeyer, who was armed with a 12 gauge Remington 870 shotgun. Niggemeyer approached Gale from the opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> past a group of security guards, and saw Gale lift his gun to Brooks' head, and fired a single shot as Gale noticed him. Gale was struck in the face with eight of the nine buckshot pellets and killed instantly. Gale was found to have had 35 rounds of ammunition remaining.|$|E
25|$|A {{version of}} the opera adapted to modern dance was choreographed by the American Mark Morris, who {{originally}} danced both the roles of Dido and the Sorceress. It premiered on 11 March 1989 at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre Varia in Brussels. It has since been performed many times and was filmed in 1995 by Canadian director Barbara Willis Sweete, with Morris in the roles of Dido and the Sorceress. Another dance version, choreographed by Sasha Waltz, premiered at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin on 29 January 2005 and opened with the dancers performing underwater in an enormous tank. The production was subsequently seen at the Grand ThÃ©Ã¢tre in Luxembourg, OpÃ©ra national de Montpellier, and Sadler's Wells Theatre in London. In both the Morris and the Waltz adaptations, the characters are each portrayed by both a singer and a dancer, with the dancers onstage and the singers performing from the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> or the orchestra pit.|$|E
50|$|In front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> {{there is}} a {{crescent-shaped}} lotus pond which is 12.67 meters in radius and is used to collect <b>the</b> rainwater <b>of</b> <b>the</b> open space. Running throughout the year, the pond water strengthens <b>the</b> sound effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> On both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> there are some platforms on which reinforced concrete pergolas of wisteria are built. Below <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> there are rest rooms, wash rooms and store rooms, etc.|$|R
50|$|The proscenium, in {{conjunction}} with stage curtains called legs, conceals <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> which are known as the wings. The wings may be used by theatre personnel during performances and as storage spaces for scenery and theatrical properties. Several rows of short curtains across <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> called teasers, hide the backdrops, which in turn are hidden above <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> in <b>the</b> fly system loft until ready for use.|$|R
50|$|The Odeon {{was a small}} roofed theatre {{constructed}} by Vedius Antonius and his wife around 150 AD. It was a small salon for plays and concerts, seating about 1,500 people. There were 22 stairs in the theatre. <b>The</b> upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theatre was decorated with red granite pillars in the Corinthian style. The entrances were at both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> and reached by a few steps.|$|R
