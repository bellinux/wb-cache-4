5|$|Another {{mission to}} Titan {{proposed}} in early 2012 by Jason Barnes, a <b>scientist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Idaho, is the Aerial Vehicle for In-situ and Airborne Titan Reconnaissance (AVIATR): an unmanned plane (or drone) that would fly through Titan's atmosphere and take high-definition {{images of the}} surface of Titan. NASA did not approve the requested $715 million, {{and the future of}} the project is uncertain.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, Verma was {{appointed}} as a <b>scientist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, where in 2001, he and Lalji Singh invented universal primer technology for wildlife identification, {{for which he}} later received a number of international patents, and several national awards including the CSIR Technology Award in 2008 (jointly conferred to Verma and Lalji Singh), the 2009 NRDC Award (jointly conferred on Verma and Singh) and the BioAsia Innovation Award in 2009.|$|E

50|$|In 1975, {{there was}} a cluster of {{juvenile}} arthritis patients in the towns of Lyme and Old Lyme, CT, and <b>scientists</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Station {{were among the first}} to determine that this disease was carried by ticks. After this discovery, <b>scientists</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Station, including John F. Anderson and Louis A. Magnarelli (former and current Station Directors, respectively) along with collaborators from other institutions were able to isolate and identify the spirochete that causes Lyme disease in humans. <b>Scientists</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Station were also instrumental in developing antibody tests to identify patients infected with Lyme disease agent as well as other tick-borne illnesses such as human granulocytic erlichiosis and babesiosis.|$|R

5|$|To {{fund the}} new project, Roberts sold 15% of MITS to fellow Air Force officer, Lieutenant William Yates. He also got an {{investment}} from another Weapons Laboratory officer, Major Ed Laughlin. Several other officers and <b>scientist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lab {{were interested in}} this {{state of the art}} calculator kit and helped with the design. Forrest Mims wrote the assembly manual in return for a calculator kit.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Earth, Van den Berg {{continued to work}} on crystal growth experiments at EG in California and he became the head for the section of materials science. At a later time he moved to Florida to become a chief <b>scientist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Constellation Technology Corporation. At age 72, he continued to work up to 40 hours a week and grow crystals, a process he compares to gardening. The crystals he grows (Mercuric Iodide crystals) are used to make precision detectors for nuclear radiation. These detectors are used in medical applications, by the defense industry and the International Atomic Energy Agency.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Adam Pierce, a <b>scientist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, {{intercepts}} {{a visual}} transmission from Firewalker, a mobile robot sent by a volcanic research project on Mount Avalon near Bend, Oregon. Firewalker is broadcasting from inside a volcanic cave, where Pierce glimpses {{the dead body}} of the chief seismologist, Phil Erickson. He also sees a shadow moving in the cave, an impossibility due to the extremely high temperatures. Firewalker's camera is then destroyed, ending the transmission.|$|E

50|$|In 2003, <b>scientists</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> FLNR {{reported}} that they had been able to synthesise 249No, which decayed by SF with a half-life of 54 µs. Further work in 2006 by <b>scientists</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ANL showed that the activity was actually due to a K-isomer in 250No. The ground state isomer was also detected with a very short half-life of 3.7 µs.|$|R

5|$|In 1971–72, Singh {{worked as}} a {{research}} associate at the Department of Zoology, University of Calcutta and in April 1974, he was appointed as pool officer of CSIR. In 1974, Singh received the Commonwealth Fellowship to carry out research at the University of Edinburgh, UK, where he worked until 1987. During that time, Singh also {{worked as a}} guest <b>scientist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Calcutta, India, {{for a short period of}} time and visited the Australian National University in Canberra as a visiting fellow.|$|E

Verma completed his D.Phil. in medical oncology at the University of Oxford in 2007, and in January 2008 returned to India to continue his work at the CCMB.

Liu Shanying, a political <b>scientist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who used to work for CCTV, speculated that the showing indicated that Chinese film censorship might be being loosened.|$|E

5|$|Instead of {{alerting}} the police, {{the family}} took the silencer to Boutflour's sister's home. Boutflour said it felt sticky. They found red paint and blood on it, {{and the surface}} of it had been damaged. When the police collected the silencer from them on 12 August, {{five days after the}} murders, an officer reportedly noticed an inch-long grey hair attached to it, but this had gone by the time the silencer arrived at the Forensic Science Service at Huntingdon. A <b>scientist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Forensic Science Laboratory, Mr. Hayward, found blood on the inside and outside surface of the silencer, the latter not enough to permit analysis. The blood inside was found to be the same blood group as Sheila's, although {{it could have been a}} mixture of Nevill's and June's. A firearms expert, a Mr. Fletcher, said the blood was backspatter, caused by a close-contact shooting.|$|E
5|$|Penney {{was anxious}} to secure the {{services}} of Titterton, who had recently emigrated to Australia, as he had worked on the American Trinity and Crossroads tests. Menzies asked the vice chancellor of the Australian National University, Sir Douglas Copland, to release Titterton to work on Operation Hurricane. Cockcroft also wanted assistance from Leslie Martin, the Department of Defence's Science Advisor, {{who was also a}} professor of physics at the University of Melbourne, to work in the health physics area. The two men knew each other from their time at Cambridge University before the war. After some argument, Martin was accepted as an official observer, as was W. A. S. Butement, the Chief <b>Scientist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Department of Supply. The only other official observer was Solandt from Canada.|$|E

5|$|The next day, on Christmas, Aya and her partner, Daniel, {{go to see}} a <b>scientist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Museum of Natural History named Dr. Klamp. He {{teaches the}} protagonists about mitochondria, {{but they do not}} find his {{information}} useful since it does not explain the previous night's events. Later that day, they hear that Eve is in Central Park, and to make matters worse, an audience has gathered at the park's theater intending to see a performance that Melissa Pearce was to give. Aya enters Central Park alone as Daniel is unable to pass through the entrance without spontaneously combusting. She makes it to the theater, but is too late to stop Eve, who causes the theater audience's mitochondria to rebel against their hosts and turns the crowd into a slimy orange mass. Aya chases after Eve and is knocked unconscious after a fight with her aboard a horse-drawn carriage. Daniel discovers that his son, Ben, was at the park, but had left the audience at the Central Park theater when he began to feel ill and when his mother began to act strange. He also learns that Manhattan is being evacuated due to the threat that Eve poses.|$|E
