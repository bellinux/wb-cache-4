5|$|The stable {{originally}} had stalls for 116 healthy and 12 ill horses. The stable was insured for 12,000 Norwegian speciedaler, twice the amount {{for the head}} office building. The wagon depot had space for 28 trams and 16 sleds. The 16 sleds were purchased between 1875 and 1879, and replaced the horsecars during the winter. The forge had space for two smiths and featured a <b>small</b> <b>room</b> where the horses were shoed.|$|E
5|$|Accum {{held his}} first lecture on {{chemistry}} and mineralogy in a <b>small</b> <b>room</b> {{in his house}} on Old Compton Street. His audience grew so rapidly that he soon had to rent the Medical Theatre on Cork Street. After resigning from the Royal Institution and taking a new position with the Surrey Institution, he continued with his popular lectures. An advertisement in The Times on January 6, 1809 indicates that Accum offered a course on mineralogy and the chemical analysis of metals every Wednesday evening.|$|E
5|$|Five police officers, {{who volunteered}} {{to carry out the}} execution, were each paid $300. The {{shooters}} used identical Winchester Model 94 rifles. One prison official selected each rifle at random from a table and handed them to another prison official sitting in a <b>small</b> <b>room,</b> out of sight. The second prison official would then load the rifle, and return it to the table. Four of the rifles were loaded with live ammunition. One was secretly loaded with a wax bullet so that none of the officers would be certain that they fired a deadly shot. The non-lethal cartridge was tested to ensure that the report and recoil was difficult to distinguish from a real cartridge.|$|E

5|$|Géricault, who {{had just}} been forced to break off a painful affair with his aunt, shaved his head and from November 1818 to July 1819 lived a disciplined monastic {{existence}} in his studio in the Faubourg du Roule, being brought meals by his concierge and only occasionally spending an evening out. He and his 18-year-old assistant, Louis-Alexis Jamar, slept in a <b>small</b> <b>room</b> adjacent to the studio; occasionally there were arguments and on one occasion Jamar walked off; after two days Géricault persuaded him to return. In his orderly studio, the artist worked in a methodical fashion in complete silence and found that even the noise of a mouse was sufficient to break his concentration.|$|E
5|$|Overlooking Old Grimsby harbour and the {{anchorage}} of St Helen's Pool, the blockhouse {{would have}} housed {{a battery of}} two or three artillery pieces, positioned on a square gun platform on top of a rocky outcrop. An earthwork bank and a stone wall were built to protect it from attack from the beach and the landward sides respectively. A <b>small</b> <b>room</b> to provide living quarters for the garrison was later constructed {{on the side of the}} gun platform.|$|E
5|$|Raci {{was born}} on February 8, 1985 in the Philippines. She attends California State University, Los Angeles on a merit-based scholarship, and must {{maintain}} a GPA of at least 3.5. She moved to the United States {{at the age of}} 15, and she is now beginning her university studies in history with a pre-law option. Raci is on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). She wants to be seen as normal girl, and is reluctant to reveal that she is a trans woman. She is also poor and hearing-impaired; she speaks English as a second language, and she is living away from her mother for the first time. Raci and her aunt rent a <b>small</b> <b>room</b> in Eastside Los Angeles.|$|E

5|$|South of {{the great}} hall was a two-storey {{building}} containing withdrawing chambers, dating from around 1200. Narrow windows opening onto the bailey were original but have since been filled in. The first floor was entirely occupied by the great chamber, furnished with a fireplace. In the south-west {{corner of the room}} was a door to a <b>small</b> <b>room</b> which was perhaps used as a safe. The ground floor was used as a cellar, through which the Carrickfergus Tower could be accessed. The polygonal tower was also accessible through the great chamber at first floor level. Fitted with latrines and a fireplace, it was an extension of the lordly accommodation provided by the great chamber.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} building, which incorporated {{stone and}} tiles scavenged from the Roman fort, {{was a simple}} one consisting only of a nave and an apsidal chancel, with a <b>small</b> <b>room,</b> or porticus, built out {{from each of the}} church's northern and southern sides where the nave and chancel met. The church was much altered and expanded during the Middle Ages; the last addition, in the 15th century, was of north and south porches leading into the nave. This expansion coincided with a long period of prosperity for the settlement of Reculver, but its decline led to the church's decay and, in the face of coastal erosion, its almost complete demolition in 1809.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} cruck {{hall was}} replaced by the present Great Hall in 1512, after Sir Alexander Radclyffe was appointed High Sheriff of Lancashire. The hall is typical of others built at that time in the northwest of England, although {{it is one of the}} largest, and is unusual for the period in having no wall fireplace. The hall has an elaborate roof structure, as in the similar Rufford Old Hall. There is a slightly later <b>small</b> <b>room</b> above the large oriel bay, which may be an early addition as at Samlesbury Hall.|$|E

5|$|With {{the score}} now 2–0 {{in favor of}} Spassky, many {{observers}} believed that the match was over and Fischer would leave Iceland, and, indeed, Fischer looked to board the next plane out of Iceland, only to be dissuaded by his second, William Lombardy. His decision {{to stay in the}} match was attributed by some to another phone call from Kissinger and a deluge of cablegrams to Fischer. Spassky, owing to his sporting spirit and respect and sympathy for Fischer, agreed to play the third game in a <b>small</b> <b>room</b> backstage, {{out of sight of the}} spectators. According to Pal Benko and Burt Hochberg, this concession was a psychological mistake by Spassky.|$|E
5|$|The {{libretto}} {{was published}} in Mantua in 1607 {{to coincide with the}} premiere and incorporated Striggio's ambiguous ending. However, Monteverdi's score published in Venice in 1609 by Ricciardo Amadino shows an entirely different resolution, with Orpheus transported to the heavens through the intervention of Apollo. According to Ringer, Striggio's original ending was almost certainly used at the opera's premiere, but {{there is no doubt that}} Monteverdi believed the revised ending was aesthetically correct. The musicologist Nino Pirrotta argues that the Apollo ending was part of the original plan for the work, but was not staged at the premiere because the <b>small</b> <b>room</b> which hosted the event could not contain the theatrical machinery that this ending required. The Bacchantes scene was a substitution; Monteverdi's intentions were restored when this constraint was removed.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a {{spacecraft}} travelling through space. Minogue enters a <b>small</b> <b>room</b> in the spacecraft, wearing a pink spacesuit, and subsequently takes off her helmet and gloves; intercut scenes through the video has the spacecraft travelling through different space fields and atmospheres. By the first chorus, Minogue starts taking off parts of her spacesuit whilst spaceman from different rooms witness her. Next, she turns on a machine that projects smoke and distracts them. She then becomes fully nude by the second chorus; this marks Minogue's first video {{that she has been}} nude in until her 2001 advert campaign with Agent Provocateur. Another spaceman witnesses Minogue nude but covers herself with a red blanket, and closes the window. The video ends with Minogue laying on a soft bedding, turning the lights off, and the spacecraft traveling to another destination.|$|E

5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi. It opens with Hamasaki watching her previous music videos on several television screens. Sitting in a <b>small</b> <b>room,</b> she exits it and finds {{a large amount of}} fans and paparazzi bombarding her; scenes interspersed through the main plot feature her looking towards a mirror. Following the first chorus, Hamasaki is shown riding through Tokyo city, including her appearance at a recording studio singing the song, and on top of a skyscraper at night. The frames subsequently re-appear throughout the visual, with it ending with a blurry shot of Hamasaki looking away from the mirror, and the TV screens from the first shot displaying the logo of Avex Trax. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016). It was additionally used as the theme for Japanese television show Semi Double (1999).|$|E
5|$|Gray's Almshouses on East Street {{were founded}} by Robert Gray in 1615 for poor single women. The red brick {{buildings}} bear {{the arms of}} Robert Gray, dated 1635, and another arms of the Merchant Tailors. A <b>small</b> <b>room</b> is used as chapel and has original benches and a painted ceiling. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. St Margaret's Almshouses was founded as a leper colony in the 12th century. Glastonbury Abbey acquired the patronage of the hospital in the late 13thcentury and rebuilt it as almshouses in the early 16th century. From 1612 to 1938 the building continued {{to be used as}} almshouses, cared for by a local parish. In the late 1930s it was converted into a hall of offices for the Rural Community Council and accommodation for the Somerset Guild of Craftsmen. It later fell into disrepair until the Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust with Falcon Rural Housing purchased and restored it for use as four dwellings of social housing. It is a gradeII* listed building.|$|E
5|$|On 3 May 1957, a {{group of}} citizens, {{including}} Otto Frank, established the Anne Frank Stichting {{in an effort to}} rescue the Prinsengracht building from demolition and to make it accessible to the public. The Anne Frank House opened on 3 May 1960. It consists of the Opekta warehouse and offices and the , all unfurnished so that visitors can walk freely through the rooms. Some personal relics of the former occupants remain, such as movie star photographs glued by Anne to a wall, a section of wallpaper on which Otto Frank marked the height of his growing daughters, and a map on the wall where he recorded the advance of the Allied Forces, all now protected behind Perspex sheets. From the <b>small</b> <b>room</b> which was once home to Peter van Pels, a walkway connects the building to its neighbours, also purchased by the Foundation. These other buildings are used to house the diary, as well as rotating exhibits that chronicle aspects of the Holocaust and more contemporary examinations of racial intolerance around the world. One of Amsterdam's main tourist attractions, it received a record 965,000 visitors in 2005. The House provides information via the internet and offers exhibitions that in 2005 travelled to 32 countries in Europe, Asia, North America, and South America.|$|E
