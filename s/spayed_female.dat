50|$|Spaying and NeuteringSpaying and neutering holds many {{advantages}} to cats, including lowering {{the risk for}} developing cancer. Neutering male cats makes them less subjected to testicular cancer, FeLV, and FIV. <b>Spaying</b> <b>female</b> cats lowers the risk for mammary cancer, ovarian, or uterine cancer, as it prevents them from going into heat. Female cats should be spayed before their first heat, as each cycle of heat creates a greater risk for mammary cancer. <b>Spaying</b> a <b>female</b> cat requires {{the removal of the}} ovaries and uterus, which would eliminate their chances of developing cancer in these areas.|$|R
5000|$|Breeds {{that may}} be more {{commonly}} affected include the English Cocker Spaniel, German Shepherd Dog, Alaskan Malamute, Dachshund, and Springer Spaniel. [...] It is a disease of middle-age to older dogs and even though early reports described <b>spayed</b> <b>females</b> as more commonly affected, multiple recents studies have shown no gender overrepresentation.|$|R
25|$|Studies {{of cardiac}} tumors in dogs {{showed that there}} was a 5 times greater risk of hemangiosarcoma (cancer of blood vessel lining), one of the three most common cancers in dogs, in <b>spayed</b> <b>females</b> than intact females and a 2.4 times greater risk of hemangiosarcoma in {{castrated}} dogs as compared to intact males.|$|R
50|$|Residual ovary {{syndrome}} or ovarian remnant {{syndrome is}} a condition that occurs when ovarian tissue is left behind following oophorectomy, causing development of a pelvic mass, pelvic pain, and occasionally dyspareunia.

50|$|Neutering reduces {{problems}} caused by hypersexuality, especially in male dogs. <b>Spayed</b> <b>female</b> dogs {{are less likely to}} develop some forms of cancer, affecting mammary glands, ovaries, and other reproductive organs. However, neutering increases the risk of urinary incontinence in female dogs, and prostate cancer in males, as well as osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, cruciate ligament rupture, obesity, and diabetes mellitus in either sex.|$|E

25|$|Urinary incontinence* is leakage of urine, usually due to {{incompetence}} of the urethral sphincter {{in adult}} dogs and ectopic ureter (a congenital {{condition in which}} the ureter enters the urinary tract posterior to the urethral sphincter) in puppies. In adult dogs it is most commonly seen in large <b>spayed</b> <b>females.</b> The lack of estrogens in spayed dogs {{has been linked to}} development of incontinence. Replacement of estrogens, phenylpropanolamine, and surgery have all been used for treatment.|$|R

40|$|Summary. Oestrogen pellets {{implanted}} in castrated or spayed rats cause both the {{males and females}} to take {{a considerable amount of}} voluntary exercise. Testosterone pellets cause implanted <b>spayed</b> <b>females</b> to take considerable exercise but their effect on the castrated male is much less. If the male has previously been under the influence of an oestrogen pellet, the amount of activity that results when a testosterone pellet is implanted is increased. The suggestion is made that once the responsible brain centre has been exposed to oestrogen it becomes sensitive to the action of testosterone...|$|R

5000|$|Increased {{aggression}} can {{be shown}} in altered females if they have previously displayed aggression prior to surgical alteration. In a study by O'Farrell and Peachy, female dogs less than 11 months of age that had previously shown signs of aggression {{are more likely to}} have an increase in aggression after being spayed. These increases in aggression may be due to the sudden change in hormone concentrations that are the result of alteration. While <b>spaying</b> <b>female</b> dogs does not [...] "induce" [...] aggression, it can increase aggression and facilitate indiscriminate appetite in young altered females and can include them rapidly eating meals or eating food-associated items such as trash.|$|R
5000|$|While {{external}} sexual {{organs of}} the animals who were sterilized {{at a younger age}} did not mature fully or to the same extent of those sterilized later, there was no significant negative impact on urinary tract health for most animals. [...] Male cats sterilized at a younger age experienced a lower rate of urinary tract blockage than male cats sterilized at an older age. [...] The one significant cause for concern in the studies was an increased incidence of urinary incontinence in female dogs leading to recommendations to delay <b>spaying</b> <b>female</b> dogs until 3 months of age when there is no concern about non-compliance with spay policies.|$|R

40|$|I {{have long}} {{regarded}} adrenal dysfunction as a wellspring of excess estrogen which {{may contribute to}} hormonal imbalances, immune destabilization, and increased vulnerability to disease. As a practicing clinician, I have consistently found elevated total estrogen {{as part of an}} endocrine-immune derangement present in many common diseases of dogs and cats. Ninety percent of these cases involve <b>spayed</b> <b>females</b> and neutered or intact males, so the elevated estrogen cannot be attributed to ovarian activity. Sick and intact females, tested outside their estrus period, frequently have an elevated estrogen level as well. The pattern of derangement identified in thousands of cases over three decades involves insufficient cortisol, high estrogen, and abnormally low IgA, IgG, and Ig...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Earlier {{experiments}} on guinea-pigs {{are said to}} demonstrate the essential participation of small amounts of progesterone at normal oestrus. The guinea-pig vagina shows an elaborate proliferation just before oestrus, with stratified epithelial cells at the base, which eventually cornify, and loosely arranged mucified cells next to the lumen. Attempts with different hormones to reproduce this transitory condition in <b>spayed</b> <b>females</b> have shown that it is slow to develop but can be induced by 6 to 12 =m benzoate spread over 3 to 4 days. This is enough for full vaginal oestrus including cornification and, in some females, mating. There was no evidence from these experiments of pre-ovulatory progesterone being a significant factor at oestrus...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Experiments {{have been}} {{conducted}} on maternal-nest building and factors affecting its occurrence in the rabbit. Females deprived of nesting material built a nest {{out of their own}} body hair and were as successful in rearing young as does which used both body hair and straw; females deprived of body hair (by shaving) and nesting material showed defective maternal behaviour. Interrupting pregnancy by spaying or foetectomy resulted in maternal-nest building. Nest building was induced in <b>spayed</b> <b>females</b> by the withdrawal of progesterone after injections of progesterone and oestradiol for several weeks. Similar regimes did not induce nest building by castrated males. Further experiments strongly suggest that the onset of nest building is governed by the change in the ratio of progesterone to oestrogen...|$|R
