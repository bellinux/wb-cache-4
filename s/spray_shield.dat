50|$|The Philippines came next. An {{assault on}} Mindoro, 12 - 15 December, was her initial step. One {{airplane}} was damaged in the battle. More fierce airplane attacks came when Philip joined a screening force around a resupply echelon traveling from Leyte to Mindoro, later that month. Frequent raids with coordinated bombing and suicide attacks {{by as many}} as six planes at one time greeted the slow convoy during its entire trip. Two of the attackers were shot down by the destroyer and another was damaged. A 20-millimeter shell, fired by an LCT at a Japanese plane, landed upon the aluminum <b>spray</b> <b>shield</b> on the ship's starboard bridge wing, tearing a hole in the structure and wounding two men. One of the wounded men died five hours after the accident.|$|E
30|$|The samples {{prepared}} with cation exchange resin, {{described in the}} NMR section above, were also utilized for FTICR-MS analysis. The acid-insoluble sample was re-dissolved using UHQ water amended with NH 4 OH (final concentration 0.05 %, pH  9). All samples were diluted to give a final sample composition of 1 : 1 H 2 O:MeOH and were continuously infused into an Apollo II ESI ion source (operating in negative ion mode) of a Bruker Daltonics 12 Tesla Apex Qe FTICR-MS using a syringe pump operating at 120  μL/hr. ESI voltages were optimized for each analysis using a <b>spray</b> <b>shield</b> voltage of 3.3 - 3.5  kV and a capillary voltage of 4.0 - 4.2  kV, yielding consistent and stable ESI <b>spray</b> <b>shield</b> and capillary currents of 180 – 210  nA and 20 – 30  nA, respectively. Ions were accumulated for 2 – 5  sec in a hexapole before being transferred to the ICR cell, where 300 transients, collected with a 4 MWord time domain, were added, giving about a 30 – 40  min total analysis time. The summed FID signal was zero-filled once and Sine-Bell apodized prior to fast Fourier transformation and magnitude calculation using the Bruker Daltonics Data Analysissoftware.|$|E
40|$|A self {{contained}} spray application is developed for one handed operation in a zero gravity vacuum environment by a free flying astronaut not attached to any spacecraft. This spray applicator eliminates {{contamination of the}} operator by back spray. This applicator includes a rigid accumulator containment of a fluid within a flexible bladder the fluid being urged out of the accumulator under pressure through a spray gun. The spray gun includes a spring loaded lockable trigger which controls a valve. When in an open position, the fluid passes through the valve into the ambient environment {{in the form of}} a spray. A <b>spray</b> <b>shield</b> is provided which directs the flow of the spray from the applicator by trapping errant particles of spray yet allowing the passage of escaping gases through its material...|$|E

50|$|The {{southern}} bridge ramp begins {{behind its}} junction with the Stralsund ring road (the B 96 federal road) and consists, of an 85.53-metre-long embankment structure, measured to the abutment {{of the first}} approach bridge. Beyond it are the two Stralsund approach bridges (Vorlandbrücken Stralsund) with gradients of up to 4%. The first, structure BW 1.1, is 327.5-metre-long bridge made of pre-stressed concrete with ten sections and a twin prestressed beam slab girder as the superstructure. BW 1.2 is a 317.0-metre-long bridge with six sections and a single-cell steel composite superstructure that was manufactureed by the steelworks in Neumarkt-Sengenthal. An architectural feature is the B 96 approach road section with its two pairs of Y-supports, which enable the large column spacing of 72 metres at constant height. The railings of the approach bridges have 0.70-metre-high inside walls with laminated safety glass panels as wind deflectors and <b>spray</b> <b>shields.</b> The structures are founded on driven concrete piles cast in-situ.|$|R
30|$|Earthworm’s role as farmer’s {{friend is}} well known since time immemorial. In recent times, the {{commercial}} vermin culturists have started promoting a product, called vermiwash. This vermiwash contains enzymes, secretions of earthwarms which would stimulate the growth and yield of crops and even develop resistance in crops receiving this <b>spray</b> (<b>Shield</b> 1982; Anand et al. 1995; Suthar et al. 2005; Yadav et al. 2005). Vermiwash also has soluble plant nutrients apart from some organic acids and mucus of earthworms and microbes (Shivsubramanian and Ganeshkumar 2004). Zambare et al. (2008) showed the effectiveness of vermiwash on cowpea plant growth by laboratory-scale trial. The effect of vermiwash was observed on the growth and productivity of Marigold (Shivsubramanian and Ganeshkumar 2004). The effect of vermiwash spray significantly increased dry chilli yield (George et al. 2007). Buckerfield et al. (1999) reported that weekly applications of vermiwash increased radish yield by 7.3  %. Thangavel (2003) also showed that both growth and paddy yield increased with the application of vermiwash and vermicast extracts. The present study was carried out to evaluate the effect of vermiwash on seed germination of green mung, Vigna radiate, {{in addition to the}} composition of vermiwash extracted by different methods and also to find out which method was more effective in seed germination.|$|E
2500|$|More 40mm Bofors and Oerlikon {{guns were}} mounted {{in place of}} the removed torpedo tubes, and the MKIV {{elevating}} column Oerlikon mountings were replaced with the simpler MKVIA mountings; those ships that were to serve as Coastal Forces control frigates hunting E-boats had extra guns fitted. On some ships, either gun shields were fitted to the main armament, or a <b>spray</b> and blast <b>shield</b> was fitted to the B gun. Two-inch rocket flare projectors were fitted to the B gun: six if the <b>spray</b> and blast <b>shield</b> was fitted, three if not. A 2-pounder (40mm) [...] "pom-pom" [...] bowchaser was fitted to ships that were to serve as Coastal Forces control frigates.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} day, {{a protest}} occurred outside the Kalgoorlie Courthouse. Approximately 200 people, some armed with rocks and bottles, broke down {{the gates of}} the court and surrounded police; who used pepper <b>spray</b> and riot <b>shields</b> in response. Twelve police officers were injured during the disorder, with one requiring stitches, while several demonstrators were arrested. Five police cars and a local business were damaged.|$|R
5000|$|Police CQC {{doctrine}} is also specialized by unit type and mission. Riot control, corrections, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team and SWAT teams, for example, each have different goals, but may {{make use of}} similar tactics and technology such as non-lethal force. A prison, for example, may have a squad which specializes in high-risk cell extractions, and psychiatric hospitals or wards often have similar specialized teams. Among the [...] "less-lethal" [...] tools and tactics central to police CQC are electroshock guns, pepper <b>spray,</b> riot <b>shields</b> and riot guns to fire tear gas, rubber bullets, plastic bullets, or beanbag rounds. However, so-called [...] "less-lethal" [...] weapons can still inflict injuries that may result in death.|$|R
40|$|Seven {{fungicides}} {{have been}} tested on cucumber against downy mildew caused by Pseudoperonospora cubensis namely Amistar (azoxystrobin), Curzate (cymoxanil + mancozeb), Ridomil MZ (metalaxyl + mancozeb), Blitox- 50 (copper oxychloride), Indofil M- 45 (mancozeb), Companion (mancozeb + carbendazim) and Shield during 2006 - 07. Spray application of each fungicide was started in the 1 st week of July and in all three sprays were given at 14 days interval. Data were also recorded in terms of fruit yield per plot and data of two years were pooled and analyzed. Among all the fungicides tested Ridomil MZ proved the best in managing the disease up to maximum level (73. 75 %) during both the years with lowest disease severity value of 16. 11 per cent. As far as fruit yield was concerned it was recorded to be more in the plots with lesser disease severity and vice-versa. Pooled fruit yield for both the years was maximum (6. 858 kg/plot) in the plots sprayed with Ridomil MZ non-significantly followed by in those <b>sprayed</b> with <b>Shield</b> (6. 523 kg/plot) and Blitox- 50 (5. 942 kg/plot) ...|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} full-field {{imaging method}} using 3 D im-age correlation photogrammetry {{is being used}} formeasuring the tremendous variations in real bio-logical mechanical systems such as bones, tendons, ligaments, and even tissues such as blood vessels. This mea-surement method has far greater dynamic range than other full-field imaging technologies, making these measurements possible. In addition, this 3 D image correlation technology is simpler to use and less expensive to implement. The tech-nology is inherently three-dimensional, measuring total de-formation of complex objects including their shape, rather than just relative deformation. Fig. 1 : The ligament is prepared in the tensile testing machine, with the dual high-resolution digital cameras visible in the foreground. The easily applied stochastic pattern consists of dye penetrant developer overlaid with black <b>spray.</b> A <b>shield</b> is being used between images during load steps. The dynamic range of the 3 D image correlation technology allows the operator to mea-sure the event that is occur-ring, rather than modifying the event to meet the re-quirements of the measure-ment method, critical for sensitive and typically unpredictable biological sys-tems. The events can be in microns to millimeters of de-formation, static or dynamic, with no requirement for sub-micron stability. Further-more, the use of stroboscopic illumination enables dy-namic response measure-ments beyond the capability of pulsed ESPI systems. The full-field data can then be compared with finite ele-ment models for directly comparing the theoretical with the experimental. This technology has its founda-tions in the precise measure-ments of the metallics and composites material testing. This paper will discuss {{the theory of the}} technology and its ap-plications in the complex world for biomechanics and biom-imetics studies...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{water mist}} and {{water spray system}} tests inside a simulated machinery space. The tests were conducted inside a compartment measuring 8, 0 m by 12, 5 m with a ceiling height of 5, 0 m. The corresponding volume was 500 m 3. The walls and the ceiling were constructed from steel plates. The test compartment replicates an intermediate size machinery space compartment onboard a ship. Either diesel oil or heptane pool fires were used as the fire source. The fires had nominal heat release rates of 500 kW, 1 MW and 2 MW, respectively and were either fully exposed to the water <b>spray</b> or completely <b>shielded</b> by a horizontal obstruction steel plate measuring 2 m by 2 m. Three different systems were tested; (1) a water spray system flowing 500 L/min at 2 bar (this system was designed according to the SOLAS convention), (2) a low-pressure system flowing 97 L/min at 12 bar and (3) a high-pressure system flowing 60 L/min at 70 bar. In addition to the tests using these three systems, free burn tests were conducted inside the compartment. This report contains {{a description of the}} test set-up, its instrumentation, the fire test procedures and a limited presentation of the results. A more thorough analysis of the test results will be made in subsequent reports, articles and papers...|$|R
