40|$|Abstract. We {{examined}} {{the extent to}} which use of a technology-enhanced con-tinuous progress monitoring system would enhance the <b>results</b> of <b>math</b> instruc-tion, examined variability in teacher implementation of the program, and com-pared <b>math</b> <b>results</b> in classrooms in which teachers did and did not use the system. Classrooms were randomly assigned to within-school experimental and control groups. Participating students were pre- and post-tested using two standardized, nationally normed tests of math achievement. When teachers implemented the continuous progress monitoring system as intended, and when they used the data from the system to manage and differentiate instruction, students gained signif-icantly more than those for whom implementation was limited or nil. Failure to take into account intervention integrity would have made it look like continuous progress monitoring did not enhance <b>math</b> <b>results.</b> School personnel are focused increas-ingly on improvement of the overall achieve-ment of their students, and there is a need and a requirement (under the provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act) to find ways to imple-ment evidence-based instructional practices. Lack of systematic, usable data on individual student performance and progress at the class-room level is a major bottleneck to improving teaching and learning. At the same time pub-lishers are producing comprehensive technol-ogy-enhanced progress monitoring systems that provide teachers with the data they need to differentiate instruction, group students on the basis of comparable goals, and manage or adapt instruction based on student perfor...|$|R
30|$|The <b>math</b> <b>results</b> {{may suggest}} a {{developmental}} time point for which embodied spatial training {{could be more}} effective. Math improvements were more evident with older grades, {{although there is a}} possibility that these improvements were practice effects. If these improvements in older grades are replicable, then they could suggest that the impact of embodied spatial training on mathematics may either accrue over the course of development, emerge more dramatically at those points, or both. If so, this would be consistent with Sekiyama et al.’s (2014) results, suggesting a general transition from embodied to visual spatial thinking begins around seven to eight years of age with mastery at a later age.|$|R

This workshop addresses this gap in pedagogy by introducing university math lecturers to two strategies for teaching the experimental nature of <b>math</b> <b>results.</b> The first strategy (problem-solving methods) involves describing the reasoning behind mathematical proofs (i. e., a series of logical statements establishing a conclusion from given premises), and the second strategy (student-driven problem solving) puts undergraduate students in charge of solution development using guided discussion and collaboration. While the first method teaches the tools of proof and allows the instructor to share insight, set standards, and provide examples, the second method actively engages the students in discovery, investigation and experimentation, ultimately shifting the analysis, understanding, and evaluation into their hands. In this workshop, participants will learn about creating and guiding class discussion regarding mathematical proof and student-driven solving in which students work collectively to generate solutions and proofs.
