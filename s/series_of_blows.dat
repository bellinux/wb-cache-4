5|$|Two months later, on August 5, 2000, at the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, Judah {{defeated}} former IBF Light Welterweight Champion Terron Millett by fourth-round knockout. Judah {{was knocked}} {{down in the}} first round from a left hand. Judah rose quickly, and from that point on he dominated the fight. Judah hurt Millett with two combinations {{near the end of the}} first round. In round two, Judah sent Millett down with a right hand to the chin. Millett survived the round, but he was clearly hurt. In round four, Judah charged across the ring and inflicted a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>blows</b> on Millett, knocking him down again. Millett got up, but Judah continued his assault and knocked Millett down again. Millett rose at the count of four, but his legs were unsteady and the referee decided to stop the bout.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of 23 March 1935, Rattenbury was {{discovered}} in his sitting room with severe head injuries. He had sustained a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>blows</b> with a carpenter's mallet, the blows savage enough to remove the back of his skull; he died four days later. His wife confessed, but Stoner admitted to the housekeeper that it was actually he who had carried out the deed. Alma Rattenbury and Stoner were both charged, although Alma was to retract her confession after her elder son Christopher visited her in prison. Stoner was convicted and sentenced to death, later commuted to life imprisonment following the submission to the Home Secretary of a petition signed by over 300,000 people who felt that the young man had been manipulated into committing murder by the older woman. Alma, represented by Ewen Montagu, was acquitted of murder and of being an accessory after the fact but committed suicide a few days later on 4 June 1935, stabbing herself six times in the breast with a dagger before throwing herself into the River Stour at Christchurch.|$|E
25|$|Sheldon {{wrote that}} the daily report of the 4th Army claimed that the Allied attack had been a costly failure, which was hyperbole. The attackers had {{advanced}} , two defensive positions had been overrun and heavy artillery had severely bombarded German Eingreifdivisionen moving behind the front line. On the Gheluvelt Plateau, the German defence was most successful and despite {{the loss of the}} observation posts on Bellewaarde Ridge, the Eingreifdivisionen of Gruppe Wytschaete had not been needed. The Germans had proved capable of powerful and determined counter-attacks and the success of the defence of the plateau compromised a further British advance in the north, by leaving it vulnerable to enfilade fire by small arms and observed artillery-fire. A British advance across the Gheluvelt Plateau {{would have to be a}} slow process of preparatory bombardments and limited advances. British and French commanders considered the attack to be the first of a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>blows</b> which would lead to an inevitable German collapse and German commanders were concerned at the demands that the battle made on their troops.|$|E

50|$|The CCW {{works by}} {{increasing}} the velocity of the airflow over the leading edge and trailing edge of a specially designed aircraft wing using a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>blowing</b> slots that eject jets of high-pressure air. The wing has a rounded trailing edge to tangentially eject the air through the Coandă effect thus causing lift. The increase in velocity of the airflow over the wing also adds to the lift force through conventional airfoil lift production.|$|R

25|$|These hand axes {{have a more}} {{balanced}} appearance as the modification consists of a second (or third) <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>blows</b> to make the piece more uniform and provide a better finish. The modification is often called retouching and is sometimes carried out using invasive retouching or using softer, marginal, shallow blows that are only applied to the most marked irregularities leaving scale-like marks. The modification of edges with a hard hammer was carried out {{from the beginning of}} the Acheulean and persisted into the Musterian. It is therefore not mya useful as an indicator of chronology (in order for it to be considered as a marker it has to be accompanied by other complementary and independent archaeological data. The hand axes arising from this methodology have a more classical profile with either a more symmetrical almond or oval shape and with a lower proportion of the cortex of the original core. It is not always the case that the retouching had the objective of reducing an edge's irregularities or deformities, in fact, it has been shown that in some cases the retouching was carried out to sharpen an edge that had been blunted by use or a point that had deteriorated.|$|E
25|$|The same year, however, Sydney's live metal scene {{suffered}} a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>blows</b> when several venues closed down. The Lewisham Hotel {{in the inner}} western suburbs, which as The Haunted Castle had hosted metal gigs up to four nights a week since the early 1990s, decided to close its doors to metal bands {{after a series of}} vandalism incidents. The other premier venue was the Phoenician Club on Broadway in the inner city, which also hosted regular metal events including shows by international touring acts; the building's history as a live music venue dated back to the early 1970s when groups like AC/DC had played there. On 21 October 1995, however, the club hosted a dance party attended by 15-year-old Anna Wood who died three days later after taking ecstasy there. During the resultant investigation, the Phoenician Club's entertainment license was withdrawn and with the closure of another two venues shortly afterward—including the Cobra Club at the Parramatta Hotel which had been a key venue for every type of band from hair metal to thrash—the live heavy metal scene in Sydney almost came to a standstill. The Lewisham Hotel has since begun hosting metal gigs once more, although not as frequently. The old Phoenician Club building was eventually demolished in 2006 {{to make way for a}} residential precinct, and the Parramatta Hotel was similarly removed in 2003 and the site is now part of the enormous Westfield shopping complex.|$|E

60|$|It is {{not only}} as a soldier, but as a man, that Lord Roberts {{possesses}} some remarkable characteristics. He has in a supreme degree that magnetic quality which draws not merely the respect but the love of those who know him. In Chaucer's phrase, he is a very perfect gentle knight. Soldiers and regimental officers have for him a feeling of personal affection such as the unemotional British Army has never had for any leader in the course of our history. His chivalrous courtesy, his unerring tact, his kindly nature, his unselfish and untiring devotion to their interests have all endeared him to those rough loyal natures, who would follow him with as much confidence and devotion as the grognards of the Guard had {{in the case of the}} Great Emperor. There were some who feared that in Roberts's case, as in so many more, the donga and kopje of South Africa might form the grave and headstone of a military reputation, but far from this being so he consistently showed a wide sweep of strategy and a power of conceiving the effect of scattered movements over a great extent of country which have surprised his warmest admirers. In the second week of February his dispositions were ready, and there followed the swift <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>blows</b> which brought the Boers upon their knees. Of these we shall only describe here the exploits of the fine force of cavalry which, after a ride of a hundred miles, broke out of the heart of that reddish dustcloud and swept the Boer besiegers away from hard-pressed Kimberley.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} process had involved {{extensive use of}} physical models; for one <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>blowing</b> trials, mixtures <b>of</b> focused hot and cold air were directed onto ground platforms to simulate the ground effect upon take-off. This work {{was considered to be}} critical to the project as there was very little knowledge of the adverse effects which could influence the aircraft during the vertical takeoff process; as there was no airflow over the ailerons, tailplane, and rudder while the aircraft was held in a stationary hover, wingtip control jets were experimented with as an alternative reaction control approach. These research included the development of an all-new control response simulator which linked a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> simple flying controls to a computer. By the end of 1958, barely eighteen months after the start of the project, all the main features of the P.1127 were developed with one exception, that being the reaction control system, the development of which was completed by April 1959.|$|R
