40|$|An {{experiment}} {{is described in}} which <b>sale</b> <b>lot</b> display samples were used to build processing batches that mimicked standard commercial 20 tonne containers of Merino fleece wool. The wool classer’s specification was used to assign each <b>sale</b> <b>lot</b> and consignment to a month of shearing within the 1997 / 98 wool selling year from wool either grown in South-Western Australia (Fremantle) or New South Wales (Sydney). Greasy staples were collected from each <b>sale</b> <b>lot</b> and the fibre diameter (FD) profiles were measured on the OFDA 2000. The mini-commercial-consignments were sent to CSIRO, Textiles and Fibre Technology, Geelong and processed through to top using recommended CSIRO settings for 21. 5 micron wool. Utilising data from the FD profile, a fibre breakage model was developed which predicted the fibre length distribution of the top. The model was able to differentiate differences in hauteur between the consignments that otherwise were under-predicted using the TEAM equation (r 2 = 0. 38). The model could predict over 73 % {{of the variance in}} hauteur from 56 consignments. Furthermore, the model was able to predict short fibre content (% fibres < 25 mm) of the resultant tops. The new model offers scope for bette...|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} characteristics of wool are important determinants of its spinning properties, yarn quality and end use. The {{degree to which}} wools from different countries of origin may be substituted {{has important implications for}} the domestic marketing policies of Australia and New Zealand. The hypothesis examined in this paper is that the differences in wool prices can be explained by differences in the {{physical characteristics}} of the wool and that objective measures of these characteristics allow for effective arbitrage between these markets. The alternative hypothesis is that premiums or discounts exist owing to country of origin. A hedonic price analysis was conducted on wool prices in Australia and New Zealand using a balanced sample of <b>sale</b> <b>lot</b> data from the 1986 - 87 selling season. In the year examined, {{there was no evidence of}} any price premiums associated with country of origin. Crop Production/Industries, Marketing,...|$|E

40|$|SPECIALIZED feeder cattle auction {{sales are}} held in all major beefproduction states. These sales have been {{developed}} primarily to market more effectively the feeder cattle produced by relatively small producers. Historically, the small feeder cattle producers have {{found themselves in a}} difficult market position because individually they lack sufficient volumes of uniform cattle to attract buyers to their farms. Their only market alternatives were local slaughter auctions or country buyers. As a result, small farm operators combined their cattle to obtain sufficient volumes to attract buyers. This was done under the assumption that cattle of varying grades, weights, and breeds were differentiated products {{in the minds of the}} buyers when available in sufficient quantities. The purpose of this study was to analyze empirical data to identify and, when possible, to quantify the effect that specific economic factors have on the performance of feeder cattle auction sales. It has previously been shown that larger lot sizes and uniform cattle by grades, sex, and breed were significant factors in feeder cattle buyer decisions [1, p. 98]. It was also reported that the size of <b>sale</b> <b>lot</b> was important to the buyers of feeder cattle. It should therefore be recognized that, with variability in the feeder cattle that can be offered for sale, the quality of the lot is a major element in the buyer's decision to purchase feeder cattle and the price he is willing to pay. Hence, it is essential that producers and market-ing agencies recognize the importance of this variability and understand how they can merchandise feeder cattle to sell to their advantage. Methodology The data used in this presentation were obtained from eight graded cooperative beef feeder cattle sales in 1966 and seven in 1967, conducte...|$|E
