40|$|We {{assemble}} a new dataset to empirically investigate <b>subcontracting</b> in Italian public procurement. We use {{provisions of the}} pre-qualication system to disentangle two types of <b>subcontracting.</b> Under the provisions of this system, bidders in the auctions that award public contracts can be classied as either partially or fully qualied to execute the tendered project. Partially qualied bidders are required to find qualied subcontractors to execute {{part of the work}} (i. e. legally required <b>subcontracting),</b> while fully qualied bidders can freely choose whether to <b>subcontract</b> (i. e. voluntary <b>subcontracting).</b> We capture the effect of the terms of the <b>subcontract</b> on the firms' bids. We find that firms that <b>subcontract</b> by choice offer, on average, higher rebates (i. e., lower prices) than firms that are legally required to outsource. This result, which holds true after controlling for auction characteristics, firm fixed-effects, and <b>subcontracting</b> characteristics, indicates that firms discount their potential <b>subcontracting</b> position when they bid on rebates. Moreover, because <b>subcontracting</b> by choice and by law in the context of our study determines the role of horizontal and vertical outsourcing, our analysis provides the first test of these strategies in the public procurement supply chain...|$|R

Construction of the new runway therefore commenced in January 1959, with the work <b>subcontracted</b> to Selmer. First the artificial peninsula was built, then the delta of the Stjørdal River was moved, before a tunnel was built around the highway and railway.
