5|$|As of 2017, twelve Japanese {{films have}} been nominees for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and one film, Departures, {{has won the}} award. The only Japanese {{directors}} to have multiple films be nominated for the award are Akira Kurosawa and Noboru Nakamura. Kurosawa received an Honorary Award prior to {{the inception of the}} formal award for his work on Rashomon and the actual Academy Award for Dersu Uzala (<b>submitted</b> for the former Soviet Union), and had four other films <b>submitted,</b> with two of them accepted as nominees. Notably, Kurosawa's 1985 film Ran was deliberately not nominated by the Japanese film industry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film due to the poor perception he had among Japanese filmmakers at the time. Nakamura had two films, Twin Sisters of Kyoto and Portrait of Chieko, <b>submitted</b> as nominees for the award. Among all the countries that have <b>submitted</b> films for the award, Japan ranks fifth in terms of total nominees, behind Sweden (fourteen nominees) and ahead of the former Soviet Union (nine nominees).|$|E
