40|$|Selective <b>stopping</b> {{paradigms}} address selectivity in controlled behavior, {{as subjects}} <b>stop</b> certain responses or responses to certain stimuli. The literature has discussed 2 strategies for selective <b>stopping.</b> First, selective <b>stopping</b> may prolong the <b>stop</b> process {{by adding a}} discrimination stage (Independent Discrim-inate then <b>Stop).</b> Second, selective <b>stopping</b> may involve <b>stopping</b> nonselectively and then restarting the response if the signal is an ignore signal (<b>Stop</b> then Discriminate). We discovered {{a variant of the}} first strategy that occurred often in our experiments and previously published experiments: The requirement to discriminate <b>stop</b> and ignore signals may interact with the go process, invalidating the independent race model (Dependent Discriminate then <b>Stop).</b> Our experiments focused on stimulus selective <b>stopping,</b> in which subjects <b>stop</b> to one signal and ignore another. When <b>stop</b> and ignore signals were equally likely, some subjects used the <b>Stop</b> then Discriminate strategy and others used the Dependent Discriminate then <b>Stop</b> strategy. When <b>stop</b> signals were more frequent than ignore signals, most subjects used the <b>Stop</b> then Discriminate strategy; when ignore signals were more frequent than <b>stop</b> signals, most subjects used the Dependent Discriminate then <b>Stop</b> strategy. The commonly accepted Independent Discriminate then <b>Stop</b> strategy was seldom implemented. Selective <b>stopping</b> was either not selective (<b>Stop</b> then Discrim-inate), or interacted with going (Dependent Discriminate then <b>Stop).</b> Implications for the cognitive science, lifespan development, clinical science, and neuroscience of selective <b>stopping</b> are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Coal mining {{was done}} in the {{watershed}} of Black Creek as early as the winter of 1836–1837. Several people operated in the area until 1865, when it was leased to the E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company for 99 years. However, the mining was <b>stopped</b> by a strike in 1872 and for some time thereafter mining was done by several smaller companies. The mine in the watershed was run by the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad between 1901 and 1921. The Glen Alden Corp. then operated it until 1938, at which point underground mining in the watershed <b>stopped.</b> Strip mining was already underway there and it continued until 1955, when all mining <b>stopped.</b> During World War II, coal waste in the watershed was rerun through a coal processing plant to recover coal. In 1971, the land was owned by the Blue Coal Company. A total of 22 million tons of coal have been mined in the area.|$|E

40|$|Trajectory <b>stops</b> imply {{important}} semantic information, and {{the extraction}} of trajectory <b>stops</b> is the premise to carry out advanced Stop/Move analysis. This paper, {{based on the idea}} of kernel density, firstly introduces the concept of <b>stop</b> index, which is derived by cumulating spatio-temporal contribution of neighboring points, and further designs <b>stop</b> index graph to intuitively visualize the evolution of spatio-clustering degree during a trajectory. Importantly, <b>stops</b> index and its graph are related to spatial scale through neighboring radius, which then can be exploited to analyze trajectory <b>stops</b> under multiple scales. In addition, this paper introduces <b>stop</b> sequence rooted from <b>stop</b> index, and proposes an algorithm for the automatic extraction of trajectory <b>stops</b> by progressively merging <b>stop</b> sequences. According to the algorithm, a <b>stop</b> under strong GPS signal exactly corresponds to a <b>stop</b> sequence, while a <b>stop</b> under weak GPS signal could be derived by merging multiple <b>stop</b> sequences. Experiments based on own-acquired and GeoLife trajectories show that the algorithm has achieves the balance between the completeness and accuracy of <b>stop</b> extraction, and could effectively discover and extract complex and diverse trajectory <b>stops.</b> Even facing trajectories with serious drift noises, the algorithm still achieves a high rate of accuracy on <b>stop</b> extraction...|$|R
