50|$|The {{occurrence}} of S. canis was thought {{for years to}} be limited to cats and dogs with rare instances of infection in cattle and other animals. However, it has been reported to form complexes with human albumin through the formation of binding sites. This ability to bind albumin in humans, in addition to the previously studied binding ability in domesticated animals, provided strong experimental evidence that the disease could be vertically transferred to humans. Medical cases support that humans under certain circumstances can become infected. Such infections may have gone undiscovered in the past due to difficulties in characterizing the biochemical makeup of this pathogen compared to the known human-infecting species such as S. dysgalactiae. An elderly man who owned a dog was admitted to the hospital after exhibiting malaise, fever, and tachycardia, and treated with antibiotics until he recovered. Varicose ulcers present on his legs were later determined to be the points of entry for the disease, transferred from his dog, thus led to his symptoms. In another case of human infection, an elderly woman was initially admitted to the hospital after <b>slight</b> <b>bruising</b> of her eyebrow, and readmitted a few days later with a high fever. Medical analysis determined her fever was the result of meningitis and sepsis that ultimately led to the death of the patient after antibiotics failed. Additional support for the possibility of S. canis infections in humans has been provided by multiple cases linking the {{occurrence of}} the disease to dog ownership in elderly men. In these cases, all men had a history of ulcers on their lower limbs, which acted as an entry point for the transmission of bacteria from the respiratory tract of the dogs. This history, in combination with continued exposure from household dogs, led to the transfer of the disease and the expression of symptoms that required medical attention.|$|E
5000|$|On February 28th, Runhappy {{returned}} to training, following a two-month break at {{a farm in}} Texas. He was initially targeting the Grade II Churchill Downs Stakes, but <b>slight</b> <b>bruising</b> on his right hind heel delayed {{his return to the}} races by a few weeks. He remained in light training with a protective bar shoe covering his bruised heel. On March 31st, McIngvale announced that Runhappy would be pointed to the Grade I Metropolitan Mile. However, Runhappy's hoof bruise continued to limit his training into April, making it uncertain whether he would race. On April 13th, Wohlers stated: [...] "He galloped for us Sunday, and when we asked him to gallop again Monday, he kind of looked like he didn't want to, so we didn't push it. We'll just jog him {{until the end of the}} month and see where we are with him then." [...] On June 11th, Runhappy was diagnosed with a bone bruise on his right front cannon bone, putting him on the sidelines for 60 days. He {{returned to}} racing on October 1 in the Ack Ack Handicap at Churchill Downs, where he finished fourth. [...] He then was sent to California for the 2016 Breeders' Cup, where he was entered in the DIrt MIle. Though he gained an initial lead in the race, he began to fade by the [...] pole and finished eighth out of nine horses. Although McIngvale had paid $1 million to purchase a slot in the inaugural running of the Pegasus World Cup in January 2017, after the Breeders' Cup, he decided to retire Runhappy, who was sent to stand at stud at Claiborne Farm with an initial stud fee of $25,000.|$|E

40|$|Hyperspectral imaging {{technology}} {{was employed to}} detect <b>slight</b> <b>bruises</b> on Korla pears. The spectral data of 60 bruised samples and 60 normal samples were collected by a hyperspectral imaging system. To select the characteristic wavelengths for detection, several chemometrics methods were used on the raw spectra. Firstly, principal component analysis (PCA) {{was conducted on the}} spectra ranging from 420 to 1000 nm of all samples. Considering that the reliability of the first two PCs was more than 90 %, five characteristic wavelengths (472, 544, 655, 688 and 967 nm) were selected by the loading plot of PC 1 and PC 2. Then, each of the wavelength variables was considered as an independent classifier for bruised/normal classification, and all classifiers were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Two wavelengths (472 and 967 nm) with the highest values under the curve (0. 992 and 0. 980) were finally selected for modeling. The classifying model was built by partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and the bruised/normal classification accuracy of the modeling set (45 damaged samples and 45 normal samples) and prediction set (15 damaged samples and 15 normal samples) was 98. 9 % and 100 %, respectively, which {{is similar to that of}} the PLS-DA model based on the whole spectral range. The result shows that it is feasible to select characteristic wavelengths for the detection of <b>slight</b> <b>bruises</b> on pears by the methods combining the PCA and ROC analysis. This study can lay a foundation for the development of an online detection system for <b>slight</b> <b>bruise</b> detection on pears...|$|R

50|$|After the procedure, mild analgesics {{are used}} to control {{post-operative}} pain. Aspirin or aspirin substitutes {{should not be taken}} for 48 hours after the procedure (unless aspirin is prescribed for a cardiac or neurological condition). Since sterility is maintained throughout the procedure, infection is rare. But should an infection occur, it will be treated with antibiotics. Bleeding is the most common complication of this procedure. A <b>slight</b> <b>bruise</b> may also appear. If a lung or kidney biopsy has been performed, it is very common to see a small amount of blood in sputum or urine after the procedure. Only a small amount of bleeding should occur. During the observation period after the procedure, bleeding should decrease over time. If more bleeding occurs, this will be monitored until it subsides. Rarely, major surgery will be necessary to stop the bleeding.|$|R
50|$|Monk and Natalie {{examine the}} crime scene for themselves. Monk quickly notices that Gruber was married, as {{she was wearing a}} ring. He also observes several clues that suggest murder: for one, the death coconut did not come from the palm tree shading the hot tub, but from the ground {{adjacent}} to a tree in the side yard. Additionally, he notices that Gruber was actually killed in the bungalow itself, not in the hot tub: for one, she is not wearing any suntan lotion. Also, there's a large print edition book on a chaise longue adjacent to the hot tub that indicates Gruber needed reading glasses, but there are none near the body. Lastly, a <b>slight</b> <b>bruise</b> below the victim's collarbone shows that she was killed in the kitchen as the bruise matches up with the counters.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} at the Kumasi Abattoir Company Limited (K. A. C. L) in Ghana to assess the effect of pre-slaughter handling on welfare and meat quality of cattle. Behaviour measurements were done on 200 cattle pre-slaughter and the methods by which the cattle were handled were recorded to evaluate the effect of pre-slaughter handling on their welfare. Ultimate pH 24 and percent cooking loss were measured on 50 poorly-handled cattle pre-slaughter. The cattle were poorly-handled because they were beaten and, whipped. Based on pH 24, meat quality was assessed as normal (pH from 5. 5 – 5. 8), moderate dark, firm and dry (DFD) (5. 8 ≤ pH ≤ 6. 2), and DFD (pH from 6. 2 – 6. 7). Five hundred carcasses were visually observed for bruising in them {{and the number of}} non-ambulatory cattle slaughtered in a week was recorded. The relationship between pH 24 value and cooking loss in meat from the 50 poorly-handled cattle was investigated. Behaviours exhibited by poorly-handled cattle pre-slaughter included raising of their tail, kicking, lying down and refusing to move, jumping, vocalising, panting, and charging at handlers. Also lashes/whips, pulling of animals’ tails, stamping on their tails, and hitting them with sticks, stones and ropes were among the prominent methods by which the cattle were handled. Mean pH 24 and mean percent cooking loss were significant (p < 0. 05) at 6. 22 ± 0. 10 and 22. 51 ± 3. 25, respectively, for poorly-handled cattle. There was a strong negative correlation between pH 24 and percent cooking loss in poorly-handled cattle (r = − 0. 77). Out of the 500 carcasses assessed for bruising, 18 % had no bruises, 60 % had <b>slight</b> <b>bruises</b> while 22 % had severe bruises. Ninety (90) non-ambulatory cattle were slaughtered within seven (7) days, representing 7. 1 % {{of the total number of}} cattle slaughtered within that period. The results indicated that handling of cattle pre-slaughter have effects on their meat quality and welfare. Eighty-two percent of the bruised carcass and 7. 1 % of non-ambulatory animals indicated poor meat quality. Meat quality assessment indicated that most of the meat had dark, firm and dry (DFD) tendency. The water holding capacity of the meat sampled in this study (by means of cooking loss) indicated that the meat quality was compromised...|$|R
5000|$|Prosper de Mestre, whose {{full name}} was Jean Charles Prosper de Mestre, {{was the son}} of Helene Thomasse Cottrel (1760-1851). He was born illegitimately on 15 August 1789 in Lorient, in Brittany in France. His father, who wasn't present at his birth, is {{believed}} to be André Charles de Mestre (c.1756-1794). André Charles and his elder brother Jean, after whom it appears Jean Charles Prosper was named, were both soldiers in the French Army, and André Charles rose to the rank of Lieut.Colonel. Prosper's younger sister Melanie Caroline Jeanne Mestre was born 15 months later on 15 November 1790 in Lorient, and her father André Charles and her mother Helene claimed at the time that they had married in 1788 in Helene's home town of Rennes. No record of a marriage has been found in 1788 at Rennes, or at any other time, or in any other place, and it is believed that they never did legalise their union. In March 1791 André Charles' regiment was transferred under the royalist new Governor-General Behague to the island of Martinique in the French Caribbean, regarded politically as part of France. It was here 3 years later, in March 1794, that Prosper's father André Charles died. The republican General Rochambeau, who had taken over in Martinique in February 1793, and who had promoted Prosper's father to the rank of Colonel of Artillery on 10 February 1793, recorded details of Prosper's father's death in his journal. In the journal entry dated 14 March 1794 is the record [...] "The Colonel Mestre of the artillery had his head taken off by a cannon ball. I was covered in his blood and I had a <b>slight</b> <b>bruise</b> of the heel. This officer was of great merit and his loss is irreplaceable. He was day and night on the ramparts. His talents were known to me during the war in the countryside that had already happened in this country and I have myself to recognise them on this occasion. His activities were greater during the siege and his multiple assets were to be at the same time director of the artillery, captain of the gun markers and the bombardier. He leaves a wife and two children. The republic should take care of them and give them a pension because this brave man had no fortune at all except his talents, his courage and his qualities." [...] There is another gruesome mention of Prosper's father's death further down in the journal entry where mention is made of André Charles' skull bones wounding the General's aide, Marlet, in the kidneys. A year later in March 1795, Prosper's mother Helene married an officer of the invading British Army, Captain James [...] "Jean" [...] Armstrong (1769-aft.1836) of the 6th (1st Warwickshire) Regiment of Foot.|$|R
