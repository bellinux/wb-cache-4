40|$|The {{standard}} method for determining diesel particulate matter (DPM) exposures in underground metal/ nonmetal mines provides the average exposure concentration {{for an entire}} working shift, and several weeks might pass before results are obtained. The main problem with {{this approach is that}} it only indicates that an overexposure has occurred rather than providing the ability to prevent an overexposure or detect its cause. Conversely, real-time measurement would provide miners with timely information to allow engineering controls to be deployed immediately and to identify the major factors contributing to any overexposures. Toward this purpose, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) developed a laser extinction method to measure real-time elemental carbon (EC) concentrations (EC is a DPM surrogate). To employ this method, NIOSH developed a person-wearable instrument that was commercialized in 2011. This paper evaluates this commercial instrument, including the calibration curve, limit of detection, accuracy, and potential interferences. The instrument was found to meet the NIOSH accuracy criteria and to be capable of measuring DPM concentrations at levels observed in underground mines. In addition, it was found that a submicron <b>size</b> <b>selector</b> was necessary to avoid interference from mine dust and that cigarette smoke can be an interference when sampling in enclosed cabs.

40|$|Particle diffusional {{losses in}} {{confined}} flows such as pipes {{are important for}} identification of erosion or accretion build-up. Its applications are varied and prominent in industrial and biomedical applications where essentially, tubular geometries transport fluid-particle flows. Computational modelling of dilute suspensions of ultrafine and nano-scale particles dispersing in a fluid often use the Lagrangian particle tracking approach. The Euler Implicit scheme in FLUENT v 16 was evaluated for tracking such particles through a standard pipe geometry. It {{was found that the}} particles&# 039; Brownian dispersion was dependent on the computational mesh, and the integration time step for a given particle size. For the pipe geometry well established analytical solutions for particle deposition efficiency are available to directly compare the simulated results. For irregular geometries (such as human respiratory anatomy) there are no analytical solutions and experimental deposition data is scarce and an alternative method is required to verify the simulation setup. In this case the computational models were set with zero velocity and the nanoparticles released from rest. The particle motion was then initiated purely by Brownian motion. The root mean square displacement was used to compare the time step <b>size</b> <b>selector</b> (either by the Length Scale Factor, LS, or the Step Length Factor SLF approach in FLUENT; and a fixed time step using an in-house code &# 039;PARTICLE&# 039;). This provides a modelling verification framework to determine the most appropriate time step selection that reproduces the particle Brownian dispersion behaviour correctly...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-A {{theoretical}} {{study is}} described {{of the relationship}} between the number concentra-tions of dust particles as they are measured in British coal mines and the corresponding mass concentrations of dusts collected by size selecting gravimetric sampling instruments. Com-parisons are made between the mass-number relationship found experimentally and the relationship calculated from theoretical considerations. The mass concentration found experimentally to correspond to a given particle concentration is considerably greater than would be expected on theoretical grounds. This could be due to incorrect assumptions about particle shape factors in the theoretical treatment but there is evidence to suggest that some of the discrepancy is due to incorrect operation of the gravimetric <b>size</b> <b>selectors</b> and that they may accept particles considerably larger than their intended limiting size...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims to {{implement}} time integrators in the FEniCS framework. More specifically, the thesis focuses on selecting suitable time integrators, implement these and {{verify that the}} implementation works by applying them to various relevant test problems. This work resulted in a module for FEniCS, named Gryphon. The thesis is divided into four parts. The first part builds a theoretical framework which will motivate why singly diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta methods with an explicit first stage (ESDIRKs) should be considered for solving stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It will also be shown how an ESDIRK method can be utilized to solve time dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) by solving the semidiscretized system arising from first applying a finite element method. We will restrict our attention to PDEs which either {{give rise to a}} pure ODE system or a DAE (differential-algebraic equation) system of index 1. The second part discusses the implementation of Gryphon, focusing on why such a module is useful and how the source code is structured. The third part is devoted to numerical experiments on the ESDIRK solvers implemented in Gryphon. The experiments will establish convergence and give some run-time statistics for various ESDIRK schemes. We will also see that L-stability is a favorable trait when working with stiff equations, by comparing an ESDIRK method to the trapezoidal rule. It will also be verified that the step <b>size</b> <b>selectors</b> implemented in Gryphon behaves as expected. As test problems we consider the heat equation, the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation, the Gray-Scott equations, the Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations and the Cahn-Hilliard equations. The fourth part is a user manual for Gryphon. All the parameters which can be changed by the user are explained. The manual also includes example code for solving the heat equation, the Gray-Scott equations and the Cahn-Hilliard equation, to get the reader starting on solving their own problems. </p...|$|R
