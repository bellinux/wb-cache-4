40|$|The Tower is an {{official}} {{publication of the}} Georgia Tech Office of Student Media and {{is sponsored by the}} Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program and the Georgia Tech Library. This article appeared in Volume 4, pages 69 - 77. Passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags are powered by energy-harvesting charge pumps through AC-to-DC rectification of the wireless RF signal: typically a pulse-interval encoded (PIE) continuous-waveform (CW). These charge pumps are comprised of capacitors and diodes, the latter being the leading barrier of passive tag operation. Specifically, the pump diode turn-on voltage is responsible for limited <b>tag</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> read range, and reliability. The Power Optimized Waveform (POW) is a new, non-invasive transmission signal that improves RFID <b>tag</b> <b>sensitivity</b> by providing higher peak voltages without exceeding Federal Communications Commission (FCC) output power regulations. Two POWs that are tested are the 1 -POW, comprised of two sinusoids centered about a carrier signal frequency, and the Square POW, the product of a carrier signal and a voltage modulating square wave. A Dickson charge pump was used to measure the power gain of POW versus CW. Spectral efficiency and charge pump efficiency were calculated at different transmit powers and POW frequency spacing. Positive gain was achieved at low transmit powers (< ~ 4 dBm), and higher frequency spacing, making POW preferable over CW in low power applications.

Skeletal muscle {{accounts for the}} majority of glucose consumption in humans (Shulman et al. 1990), and plays a critical role in maintaining glucose homeostasis. The ectopic storage of lipids has been identified as a major cause of diabetes (Samuel and Shulman 2012), and the excess storage of lipids in skeletal muscle significantly influences its insulin <b>sensitivity.</b> Recently, <b>TAG,</b> DAG, and other bioactive lipids were proposed to be the major cause of IR in skeletal muscle (Erion and Shulman 2010). The upregulation of myocellular DGAT 1 has been demonstrated to augment TAG storage, decrease cellular DAG, and protect against high fat diet induced IR (Liu et al. 2007). The activity of DGAT 1 was proposed to be regulated by post-translational modification (Yu et al. 2002) and PKA might be the upstream regulator (Haagsman et al. 1981, 1982; Rodriguez et al. 1992). Several potential phosphorylation sites have been studied previously (Han 2011; Humphrey et al. 2013), but none was found to regulate DGAT 1 activity by biochemical methods.|$|R

We aimed to investigate whether CRP genetic variants associated with lifelong higher CRP concentrations translate into higher colorectal cancer risk. We conducted a prospective nested case-control study within EPIC including 727 cases diagnosed between 1992 and 2003 and 727 matched controls selected according to an incidence-density sampling protocol. Baseline CRP concentrations were measured in plasma samples by a high <b>sensitivity</b> assay. <b>Tagging</b> single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CRP gene (rs 1205, rs 1800947, rs 1130864, rs 2808630, rs 3093077) were identified via HapMap. The causal effect of CRP on colorectal cancer risk was examined in a Mendelian Randomization approach utilizing multiple CRP genetic variants as instrumental variables. The SNPs rs 1205, rs 1800947, rs 1130864 and rs 3093077 were significantly associated with CRP concentrations and were incorporated in a CRP allele score which was associated with 13 % higher CRP concentrations per allele count (95 % confidence interval 8 - 19 %). Using the CRP-score as instrumental variable, genetically twofold higher CRP concentrations were associated with higher risk of colorectal cancer (odds ratio 1. 74, 95 % confidence interval 1. 06 - 2. 85). Similar observations were made using alternative definitions of instrumental variables.

40|$|The citrate {{reduction}} {{method of}} synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNP) is standardized {{with the assistance}} of instru ments like spectrophotometer and TEM. A correlation has been developed between the particle diameter and the frac tional concentration of the reductant. This enables one to assess the diameter of the AuNP to be synthesized, in advance, from the composition of the reaction mixture and the diameter of the synthesized particles can be confirmed simply from spectrophotometry. Further, it has been demonstrated that the synthesized AuNPs serve as excellent acceptors for a super - efficient energy transfer (ET) from the donor coumarin 153, leading to a quenching of fluorescence of the latter. The Stern-Volmer constants determined from the fluorescence lifetimes are in the range 10 7 - 10 9 mol - 1 · dm 3 and are orders of magnitude higher than the normal photochemical quenching processes. The energy transfer efficiency in creases radically with an increase {{in the size of the}} metal nanoparticle. The highly efficient energy transfer and the variation of the efficiency of the ET process with a variation of the particle size is ascribed to a large enhancement in the extinction coefficient and an increase in the spectral overlap between the plasmon absorption band of AuNPs and the fluorescence spectrum of C 153 with an increase in the size of the nanoparticles. The impact of the work remains in providing a demonstration of a super quenching effect of the AuNPs and projects that they can be exploited for devel oping biosensors with high degree of <b>sensitivity,</b> if <b>tagged</b> to the biomacromolecules. </p...|$|R

The paper describes calculations on tag gas stability in-reactor, and tag injection tests that were carried out collaboratively with Commonwealth Edison Company in the Byron- 2 pressurized water reactor (P%a) and with Duke Power Company and Babcock and Wilcox Fuel Company in the Oconee- 2 PWM. The tests gave information on: (a) noble gas concentration dynamics as the tag gases were dissolved in and eventually removed from subsystems of the RCS; and (b) the suitability of candidate Ar, Ne, Kr and Xe isotopes for tagging PWR fuel.

In all instances the contaminants could be differentiated from the tag isotopes by operating the mass spectrometer at high resolution (2500).

40|$|Abstract Background Human importin beta {{has been}} used in all Xenopus laevis in vitro nuclear {{assembly}} and spindle assembly studies. This disconnect between species raised the question for us as to whether importin beta was an authentic negative regulator of cell cycle events, or a dominant negative regulator due to a difference between the human and Xenopus importin beta sequences. No Xenopus importin beta gene was yet identified at the time of those studies. Thus, we first cloned, identified, and tested the Xenopus importin beta gene to address this important mechanistic difference. If human importin beta is an authentic negative regulator then we would expect human and Xenopus importin beta to have identical negative regulatory effects on nuclear membrane fusion and pore assembly. If human importin beta acts instead as a dominant negative mutant inhibitor, we should then see no inhibitory effect when we added the Xenopus homologue. Results We found that Xenopus importin beta acts identically to its human counterpart. It negatively regulates both nuclear membrane fusion and pore assembly. Human importin beta inhibition was previously found to be reversible by Ran for mitotic spindle assembly and nuclear membrane fusion, but not nuclear pore assembly. During the present study, we observed that this differing reversibility varied depending on {{the presence or absence of}} a tag on importin beta. Indeed, when untagged importin beta, either human or Xenopus, was used, inhibition of nuclear pore assembly proved to be Ran-reversible. Conclusion We conclude that importin beta, human or Xenopus, is an authentic negative regulator of nuclear assembly and, presumably, spindle assembly. A difference in the Ran <b>sensitivity</b> between <b>tagged</b> and untagged importin beta in pore assembly gives us mechanistic insight into nuclear pore formation. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{analyze the}} effect of varying East Asian (EA) sulfur {{emissions}} on sulfate concentrations in the Northern Hemisphere, using a global coupled oxidant-aerosol model (MOZART- 2). We conduct a base and five sensitivity simulations, in which sulfur emissions from each continent are tagged, to establish the source-receptor (S-R) relationship between EA sulfur emissions and sulfate concentrations over source and downwind regions. We find that from west to east across the North Pacific, EA sulfate contributes approximately 80 %? 20 % of sulfate at the surface, but at least 50 % at 500 hPa. In addition, EA SO 2 emissions account for approximately 30 %? 50 % and 10 %? 20 % of North American background sulfate over the western and eastern US, respectively. The contribution of EA sulfate to the western US at the surface is highest in MAM and JJA, but is lowest in DJF. Reducing EA SO 2 emissions will significantly decrease the spatial extent of the EA sulfate influence over the North Pacific both at the surface and at 500 mb in all seasons, but the extent of influence is insensitive to emission increases, particularly in DJF and JJA. We find that EA sulfate concentrations over most downwind regions respond nearly linearly to changes in EA SO 2 emissions, but sulfate concentrations over the EA source region increase more slowly than SO 2 emissions, particularly at the surface and in winter, due to limited availability of oxidants (mostly H 2 O 2). We find that similar estimates of the S-R relationship for trans-Pacific transport of EA sulfate would be obtained using either <b>sensitivity</b> or <b>tagging</b> techniques. Our findings suggest that future changes in EA sulfur emissions may cause little change in the sulfate induced health impact over downwind continents but SO 2 emission reductions may significantly reduce the sulfate related climate cooling over the North Pacific and the United States...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Over {{the last}} few years, the active and growing {{interest}} in Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) technology has stimulated a conspicuous research activity involving design and realization of passive label-type UHF RFID tags customized for specific applications. In most of the literature, presented and discussed tags are prototyped by using either rough-and-ready procedures or photolithography techniques on rigid Printed Circuit Boards. However, for several reasons, such approaches are not the most recommended, in particular they are rather time-consuming and, moreover, they give rise to low quality devices in one case, and to cumbersome and rigid tags in the other. In this work, two alternative prototyping techniques suitable for cost-effective, time-saving and high-performance built-in-lab tags are introduced and discussed. The former {{is based on the}} joint use of flexible PCBs and solid ink printers. The latter makes use of a cutting plotter to precisely shape the tag antenna on thin copper sheets.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Many G protein-coupled receptors {{internalize}} following agonist binding. The {{studies were}} designed to identify novel means to effectively quantify this process using the orexin OX 1 receptor and the cannabinoid CB 1 receptor as exemplars. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH The human OX 1 and CB 1 receptors were modified to incorporate both epitope tags and variants (SNAP and CLIP) of the enzyme O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase within their extracellular, N-terminal domain. Cells able to regulate expression of differing amounts of these constructs upon addition of an antibiotic were developed and analysed. KEY RESULTS Cell surface forms of each receptor construct were detected by both antibody recognition of the epitope tags and covalent binding of fluorophores to the O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase variants. Receptor internalization in response to agonists but not antagonists could be monitored by each approach but sensitivity was up to six- to 10 -fold greater than other approaches when employing a novel, time-resolved fluorescence probe for the SNAP <b>tag.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> was not enhanced, however, for the CLIP tag, possibly due {{to higher levels of}} nonspecific binding. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS These studies demonstrate that highly sensitive and quantitative assays that monitor cell surface CB 1 and OX 1 receptors and their internalization by agonists can be developed based on introduction of variants of O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase into the N-terminal domain of the receptor. This should be equally suitable for other G protein-coupled receptors. </p...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare FA metabolism between HepG 2 and Huh 7 cells in response to culturing in different sera. Both HepG 2 and Huh 7 cells were grown in media containing 11 mM glucose and either 2 % HS or 10 % fetal bovine serum. After three days insulin and insulin-like growth factor- 1 signaling were measured and at seven days intracellular triacylglycerol (TAG), media 3 -hydroxybutyrate, TAG and apolipoprotein B were measured, as was the FA composition of intracellular TAG and phospholipids. Both cell lines demonstrated higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acid content, increased insulin <b>sensitivity,</b> higher media <b>TAG</b> levels and increased FA oxidation when cultured in HS.

40|$|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is {{becoming}} increasingly prevalent in logistic management, public transportation payment, and animal identification. However, for long distance applications, there are three major factors limiting its further deployment: 1. Dense reader/tag environment: a reader should be capable of managing a group of tags and avoiding interference from other readers. 2. Distance: long distance read/write is a required feature in logistics. Tags should operate with extremely low power to achieve a longer distance. 3. Low Cost: disposable tags are required in large volume deployments. To achieve low cost, compact tag design and high parametric yield are necessary. To address these problems, we employ EPC C 1 G 2 standard as our tag standard to achieve high performance in dense reader/tag environment. An operation-state based low-power tag baseband design is proposed by decomposing and mapping the tag signal flow into a pipeline asynchronous system. Furthermore, the power implications for each operation state of the tag are studied and a system level power optimization scheme is proposed to further improve the <b>tag</b> <b>sensitivity</b> by load power shaping and operation scheduling. Last but not least, modern RFID tags utilize extensive voltage scaling to achieve low power consumption which makes the tag design more sensitive to process variations in advanced technology. To achieve a high timing yield, we employ the state-of-the-art statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) tools and extend the existing SSTA algorithms to incorporate input slew and output load information. The proposed linear SSTA with slew distribution propagation demonstrates a reasonable accuracy in timing yield prediction and hence can help to achieve a high yield tag baseband design...|$|R

40|$|Emissions from {{road traffic}} are {{important}} anthropogenic sources {{of carbon monoxide}} (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs). In a complex nonlinear chemical mechanism these substances act as precursor for tropospheric ozone. Despite this nonlinear chemistry {{the sensitivity of the}} ozone production from road traffic emissions is often studied using the perturbation approach. In this approach the chemical system is linearized around a reference simulation. This method is well suited while studying the impacts of emission policies, but it can cause misinterpretations while evaluating the attribution of different sources on chemical species. For such questions the “tagging” method is well suited which is an accounting system following the reaction pathways of the different species from different sources, allowing to study the nonlinear behavior of the chemical system. Therefore we are using this tagging method to evaluate the impact of road traffic emissions on the tropospheric ozone and further compare these results with <b>sensitivity</b> studies. A <b>tagging</b> method has been integrated into the MECO(n) modelsystem (MESSyfied ECHAM and COSMO models nested n-times) which couples the regional scale chemistry-climate system COSMO/MESSy (in one direction) with the global chemistry-climate System EMAC. In contrast to the popular off-line coupling MECO(n) uses an on-line coupling allowing us to couple not only the dynamical variables but also the chemical variables in every time step of the global model. This model chain enables us to be (with respect to diagnostic methods and the boundary conditions) as consistent as possible from the global to the local scale and to evaluate the impact of the lateral resolution on detailed ozone-chemistry diagnostics like the tagging method. We present first results comparing simulations using the “perturbation approach” with the results from the tagging method focusing on the impact of road traffic emissions in Europe from global to local scale...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) {{technology}} is highly demanded in various applications, requiring a rapid {{development in the}} RFID technology. The performance o f the RFID system mainly depends on the RFID tag, as the tag will be attached on the items or objects {{that need to be}} identified. The research described in this thesis focuses {{on the development of the}} tag antenna designs to meet the requirements o f certain applications which are small size and insensitive to metal object. In this project, three designs o f UHF-RFID tag antenna were proposed; namely a compact dipole tag antenna, metal mountable meander feed line tag antenna and metal mountable ladder feed line tag antenna. The Design 1 tag antenna has obtained a size reduction o f 70 % from the straight half wavelength dipole antenna through the implementation of two miniaturization methods, which are meandering and capacitive tip-loading. However, high <b>sensitivity</b> of the <b>tag</b> to the metal objects attached leads to the formation of the Design 2 tag antenna, which included a ground plane in the antenna structure. The Design 2 tag antenna was then improved to the Design 3 tag antenna, which has smaller size and better reading range, through the implementation of capacitive tip-loading structure and ladder feed line respectively. In order to easily match the impedance o f the antenna with the chip, a T-matching technique has been inserted in all three tag antenna designs. The simulation process was carried out using CST Studio Suite software, while the measurement of S n, antenna impedance and reading range was done using fabricated jig, Image method, Vector Network Analyzer and RFID reader. From measurement, the Design 1 tag antenna has achieved the longest reading range in free air with the value o f 9. 6 in, but failed to be detected when attached on metal object. In contrast, Design 2 and Design 3 tag antennas can be detected in both conditions with the read range value of 2. 2 m and 2. 3 m in free air, while on metal object the read range is 2. 0 m and 2. 2 m respectively...|$|R
40|$|The vibrissal {{system of}} {{pinnipeds}} relies on sturdy, specialized vibrissae and supporting neural architecture apparently {{designed for the}} reception of waterborne disturbances. Although {{it is known that}} pinnipeds can use their vibrissae for fine-scale tactile discrimination and hydrodynamic detection, many aspects of vibrissal function remain poorly understood. The present work examined the adaptive significance of vibrissal structure, the sensitivity of the vibrissal system, and the signals received by this system. All of these points were considered with respect to their function in hydrodynamic reception. Four methods of study: laser vibrometry, computed tomography (CT) scanning, psychophysical testing and animal-borne tagging were used to investigate the functioning of this sensory system. Laser vibrometer recordings were used to investigate the effect of vibrissal surface structure and orientation on flow-induced vibrations in excised vibrissae. Vibrations were recorded from the shaft of excised vibrissae exposed to laminar water flow in a flume tank. Samples from three pinniped species were tested: the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) and California sea lion (Zalophus californianus). The vibrissae of the seals had an undulated surface structure, while the vibrissae of the sea lion had a smooth surface. No significant difference between species, and therefore surface structure, was observed. However, when vibrissae were tested at three angles of orientation to the water flow, a strong effect of orientation on vibration frequency and velocity was observed across species. CT scanning data revealed that the vibrissae of all the species tested had flattened cross-sectional profiles. This cross-sectional flattening could account for the observed orientation effects. Furthermore, this morphological characteristic may represent an adaptation for improved functioning in the aquatic environment by reducing self-induced-noise from swimming and potentially enhancing detection of signals from other planes. Psychophysical testing was conducted with a trained harbor seal in order to investigate the sensitivity of the vibrissal system of this species. A behavioral procedure was used to measure absolute detection thresholds for sinusoidal stimuli delivered to the vibrissae by a vibrating plate. Thresholds were measured at 9 discrete frequencies from 10 to 1000 Hz. The seal 2 ̆ 7 s performance in this stimulus detection task showed that the vibrissal array was sensitive to directly coupled vibrations across the range of frequencies tested, with best sensitivity of 0. 09 mm/s at 80 Hz. The velocity thresholds as a function of frequency showed a characteristic U-shaped curve with a gradual low-frequency roll-off below 80 Hz and a steeper high-frequency roll-off above 250 Hz. The thresholds measured for the harbor seal in this study were about 100 times more sensitive than previous in-air measures of vibrissal sensitivity for this species. The results were similar to those reported by others for the detection of waterborne vibrations, but show an extended range of frequency <b>sensitivity.</b> Animal-borne <b>tagging</b> methods were used to investigate the signals received by the vibrissae and better understand the relevant signal components involved in hydrodynamic detection. A novel tagging system, wLogger, was developed to record vibrations directly from a vibrissa by means of an accelerometer coupled to the vibrissal shaft. Laboratory testing using excised whiskers in a water flume confirmed that the tag is capable of recording vibrational signals without hampering the natural movement of the vibrissa. In addition, the tag successfully measured vibrations from the vibrissae of a harbor seal during active swimming and hydrodynamic detection. Live animal testing, along with the supplemental recordings from excised vibrissae, revealed that interaction with hydrodynamic disturbances disrupted the vibrational signal received by the whisker. When exposed to a hydrodynamic signal, whisker vibrations increased in bandwidth, spreading energy across a wider range of frequencies. This finding suggests that modulation of the vibrational signal may {{play a key role in}} the detection of hydrodynamic stimuli by the seal. The results of this dissertation research provide insight into the functioning of the vibrissal system in pinnipeds and establishes the groundwork for future pathways of investigation. By investigating the vibrissal system from the focal points of structure, sensitivity and received signals, a more comprehensive understanding of this refined sensory modality is emerging...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} the circuit and system design of interactive Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. IoT has {{the vision of}} connectivity for anything, at anytime and anywhere. One {{of the most important}} characteristics of IoT is the automatic and massive interaction of real physical world (things and human) with the virtual Internet world. RFID tags integrated with sensors have been considered as one suitable technology for realizing the interaction. However, while {{it is important to have}} RFID tags with sensors as the input interaction, it is also important to have RFID tags with displays as the output interaction. Display interfaces vary based on the information and application scenarios. On one side, remote and centralized display interface is more suitable for scenarios such as monitoring and localization. On the other side, tag level display interface is more suitable for scenarios such as object identification and online to offline propagation. For tag level display, though a substantial number of researches have focused on introducing sensing functionalities to low power Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) RFID tags, few works address UHF RFID tags with display interfaces. Power consumption and integration with display of rigid substrate are two main challenges. With the recent emerging of Electronic Paper Display (EPD) technologies, it becomes possible to overcome the two challenges. EPD resembles ordinary ink on paper by characteristics of substrate flexibility, pattern printability and material bi-stability. Average power consumption of display is significantly reduced due to bi-stability, the ability to hold color for certain periods without power supplies. Among different EPD types, Electrochromic (EC) display shows advantage of low driving voltage compatible to chip supply voltage. Therefore this thesis designs a low power UHF RFID tag integrated in 180 nm CMOS process with inkjet-printed EC polyimide display. For applications where refresh rate is ultra-low (such as electronic label in retailing and warehouse), the wireless display tag is passive and supplied by the energy harvested from UHF RF wave. For applications where refresh rate is not ultra-low (such as object identification label in mass customized manufacturing), the wireless display tag is semi-passive and supplied by soft battery. It works at low average power consumption and with out-of-battery alert. For remote and centralized display, the limitations of uplink (from tags to reader) capacity and massive-tag information feedback in IoT scenarios is the main challenge. Compared to conventional UHF RFID backscattering whose data rate is limited within hundreds of kb/s, Ultra-wideband (UWB) transmission have been verified with the performance of Mb/s data rate with several tens of pJ/pulse energy consumption. Therefore, a circuit prototype of UHF/UWB RFID tag replacing UHF backscattering with UWB transmitter is implemented. It also consists of Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes for healthcare applications of real-time remote monitoring of multiple patients ECG signals. The ECG electrodes are fabricated on paper substrate by inkjet printing to improve patient comfort. Key contribution of the thesis includes: 1) the power management scheme and circuit design of passive UHF/UWB RFID display <b>tag.</b> The <b>tag</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (the input RF power) is - 10. 5 dBm for EC display driving, comparable to the performance of conventional passive UHF RFID tags without display functions, and - 18. 5 dBm for UWB transmission, comparable to the state-of-the-art performance of passive UHF RFID tag. 2) communication flow and circuit design of UHF/UWB RFID tag with ECG sensing. The optimum system throughout is 400 tags/second with 1. 5 KHz ECG sampling rate and 10 Mb/s UWB pulse rate. QC 20151012 </p...|$|R
40|$|In the future, {{large-scale}} sensor deployment {{would enable}} many {{areas such as}} infrastructure condition monitoring and supply chain management. However, many of today's wireless sensor technologies are still too expensive to meet this need. Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) offers good potential {{for the development of}} pervasive sensors: RFID tags have a proven track record of large-scale, highly integrated deployment for object identification in the retail and consumer goods industry. Furthermore, the last decade has seen much progress in making RFID a reliable, standardized wireless communication medium with the ability to mass produce low-cost RFID tags. My thesis introduces the concept of RFID Tag Antenna-Based Sensing (RFID TABS). In this approach, a change in the sensed parameter of interest induces a controlled change in the geometry or boundary conditions of an RFID tag's antenna. The resultant change in the tag's response signal can then be detected by an RFID reader. My approach builds upon current developments in RFID technology. For instance, the manufacturing techniques for the mass production of low-cost RFID tags can be used for pervasive tag-sensor development. My thesis examines TABS in a two-pronged approach: First, I demonstrate how three fundamental tag and reader signal properties can be used for sensing and propose three classes of TABS: [...] Amplitude Modifying (AM) TABS use RFID reader transmitted power and tag response power for sensing. I illustrate proof of concept using a displacement sensor. I demonstrate that both these power metrics can be used to reliably measure structural displacement to a precision of 2. 5 mm using commercial RFID tags. [...] Frequency Modifying (FM) TABS relate changes in the sensed parameter to a shift in the tag's optimal operating frequency - the carrier frequency for which the tag is best tuned to respond to the reader. I demonstrate proof of concept using a temperature threshold sensor - the crossing of a design temperature threshold results in a shift in the sensor's optimal operating frequency. I demonstrate that the sensor works reliably over a 3 m read range and in different environmental conditions. [...] Phase Modifying (PM) TABS use tag backscatter phase for sensing. I provide a brief summary of the factors influencing RF phase and outline the design for a PM TABS fluid level sensor that uses RFID tag response phase to detect {{the presence or absence of}} fluid in a beverage glass. I highlight the challenges in the practical implementation of this approach by demonstrating the <b>sensitivity</b> of RFID <b>tag</b> phase to three extraneous factors. Second, I introduce the concept of Non-Electric Memory to record short timescale threshold crossovers in the sensed parameter that may occur when the tag-sensor is unpowered. When information about, rather than the exact time of, the threshold occurrence is sufficient, non-electric memory provides a solution. I demonstrate how non-electric memory can be integrated into sensor design at minimal added cost. In the proof of concept of a temperature threshold sensor, I design a thermally actuated shape memory polymer switch to permanently change the electrical properties of an RFID tag when the temperature threshold is crossed. I demonstrate that the design works reliably over a read range of 3 m and is independent of the material on which the sensor is deployed. In summary, this thesis demonstrates how an RFID tag can be adapted for low cost, pervasive sensing. Sensor prototypes illustrate proof of concept in three application areas. Extensions to two other applications are also discussed. by Rahul Bhattacharyya. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, 2012.

40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of the pharmacological and cosmetic practices of our ancestors is an important topic in the archaeological investigation. Drugs and cosmetics are important sources of information {{not only because they}} are a matter of daily life, but also because their social, cultural and economical implications. Under this light, the organic residues preserved in potsherds and various vessels may deliver key elements in elucidating our history. Due to chemical complexity of such organic residues, accurate and powerful analytical chemical techniques are required. The present work focuses on the application of different mass spectrometry approaches, mainly based on soft ionization techniques, aiming to reconstruct the original material used for the formulation of drugs, ointments and cosmetics in the past, through the identification of lipid fractions of organic residues found in archaeological artefacts. In order to cover in detail this analytical challenge, samples from different ages and location were studied. In particular, we investigated the organic residues found in vessels having the well known shape of kohl container from the ancient cities of Assiut (Egypt, Middle Kingdom), beehive remains from the Etruscan site of Forcello (Italy, 500 - 480 B. C) and various ointments of late monastic provenance (Spain, XIV- XVII A. C.) The first goal of the research was to asses and validate a soft ionization - mass spectrometry approach for recognizing the original materials in archaeological residues by triacylglycerols (TAGs) identification. In fact, despite the chemotaxonomic potential of TAGs in determining the origin of lipid substances, few are the related applications reported in literature. Therefore, we performed a comparative study on the TAGs distributions found in the archaeological residues and in different natural lipid-containing materials used as references. Thanks to the use of recently introduced non-porous core-particles stationary phases, {{we have been able to}} develop a new liquid chromatographic – mass spectrometry method capable to resolve complex lipid mixtures in very short time. The very good chromatographic performances prevented co-elution and enabled the use of database containing more than 500 TAGs molecular formula for the research of TAGs in the samples. Two different ionization sources were employed (APCI and ESI) and their performance were compared. In particular, their use appeared complementary, due to their different <b>sensitivity</b> against unsaturated <b>TAGs.</b> Analysis were carried out also by GC-MS (with an electron impact ionization) which is currently the most employed technique for the characterization of lipids in archaeological residues. A new derivatization procedure based on the use of switchable polarity solvents (SPS) was tested with the aim to identify specific conditions for ancient residues treatment. In fact, due to general scarcity of archaeological residues for the analysis and the need of performing a broad range of different characterizations on the same material, the development of new methods capable to separate all the different components in few steps, minimizing the loss of material, is particularly important. The analysis carried on the historical ointments residues gave us the possibility to evaluate the performance of the methods in a unprecedented and controlled aging experiment. This was possible thanks to the presence of latin label on the vessels, indicating the original recipes adopted to prepare the ointments, retrieved in extraordinary detail from historical bibliographic sources. This study gave us also the possibility to gain important indication for reconstructing the pathways of degradation of lipid materials in complex compositions. Hydrolysis and oxidation products were found as predominant fraction in the residues. Nonetheless, the original lipid material were still recognizable thanks to the use of LC-MS, because the surviving TAGs were very selectively separated from the other components and identified. Artificial aging treatments on TAG standards and the reference material showed the absence of inter-conversion phenomena from saturated to unsaturated TAGs confirming the validity of TAGs as biomarkers. Noteworthy, the characterizations of the lipid components of the historical ointments obtained by LC-MS were in agreement with those obtained by the application of GC-MS and other analytical techniques generally adopted in the study of the archaeological residues (such as FTIR). Consistency of the TAG profiling approach by LC-MS in recognizing the original lipid materials was also acknowledged through a large scale round robin test involving eleven laboratory with consolidate experience in the analysis of archeological objects. In particular, we showed as LC-MS is the most powerful technique in determining the origin of oily and fatty substances. At the same time, the characterisation of these ointments enabled us to give precious contributions in the study of an important historical period, in which the monastic pharmaceutical practices were changing from a classical “humoral medicine” to the application of the experimental approach. Nice results were obtained also by analyzing the khol remains from the ancient Egyptian city of Assiut. Thanks to the complementary use of information regarding TAG distributions and the structural feature of some specific TAGs, we have been able to distinguish vegetable oil from animal fat. In some cases, we have been also able to identify very precisely the provenance of the fatty materials. Very difficult was instead the characterisation of beehive remains found in the Etruscan site of Forcello, which is thought to be one of the first archaeological evidences of beekeeping practice prior to the classical age. The problems were related probably to contaminations of the surface, due to the firing process encountered by the archaeological site after his apogee (fifth century BC) ...|$|R
