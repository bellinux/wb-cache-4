40|$|AbstractMice {{infected}} with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM) develop a demyelinating encephalomyelitis several weeks after infection. Astrogliosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells are prominent findings in the brains and <b>spinal</b> <b>cords</b> of infected mice. In this report, astrocytes in infected <b>spinal</b> <b>cords</b> were analyzed for expression of three pleiotropic cytokines, TNF-α, IL- 1 β, and IL- 6; Type 2 nitric oxide synthase (iNOS); and MHC class I and II antigen. The data show that all three cytokines and iNOS are expressed by astrocytes in chronically infected <b>spinal</b> <b>cords.</b> These activated astrocytes are localized to areas of virus infection and demyelination, {{although most of the}} astrocytes expressing these proteins are not MHV-infected. MHC class I and II antigen can be detected in these <b>spinal</b> <b>cords</b> as well, but not in cells with the typical morphology of astrocytes. TNF-α, IL- 6, and iNOS are also evident in the brains of mice with MHV-induced acute encephalitis, but in marked contrast to the results obtained with the chronically infected mice, most of the cells expressing these cytokines or iNOS had the morphology of macrophages or other mononuclear cells and very few appeared to be astrocytes. Additionally, astrocytes and, most likely, oligodendrocytes are infected in the <b>spinal</b> <b>cords</b> of mice with chronic demyelination. These results are consistent with a role for both viral infection of glial cells and high localized levels of proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide in the demyelinating process in mice {{infected with}} MHV-JHM. They also show that analogously to the human demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis, astrocytes are a major cellular source for these cytokines in mice with chronic, but not acute disease...|$|R

5|$|At {{each level}} of the spinal column, spinal nerves branch off from {{either side of the}} <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> and exit between a pair of vertebrae, to {{innervate}} a specific part of the body. The area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve is called a dermatome, and the group of muscles innervated by a single spinal nerve is called a myotome. The part of the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> that was damaged corresponds to the spinal nerves at that level and below. Injuries can be cervical 1–8 (C1–C8), thoracic 1–12 (T1–T12), lumbar 1–5 (L1–L5), or sacral (S1–S5). A person's level of injury is defined as the lowest level of full sensation and function.

The nerve travels along the inner wall of the skull towards the jugular foramen. Leaving the skull, the nerve travels through the jugular foramen with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. The spinal accessory nerve is notable for being the only cranial nerve to both enter and exit the skull.

40|$|We {{previously}} reported that simultaneous inoculation of mice on abraded rear footpads with two nonneuroinvasive viruses (herpes simplex virus type 1 ANG and KOS) {{resulted in the}} deaths of 62 % of the animals (R. T. Javier, F. Sedarati, and J. G. Stevens, Science 234 : 746 - 748, 1986). In the current study, to better understand the events responsible for the pathogenesis of this virus mixture, we investigated replicative capacity and spread of the virus mixture within specific tissues. We found that, compared with neuroinvasiveness of ANG or KOS alone, neuroinvasiveness of the virus mixture related to significantly increased amounts of the virus within <b>spinal</b> <b>cords</b> and brains of the mice. This finding indicates that ANG and KOS have defects in their capacities to spread and replicate within <b>spinal</b> <b>cords.</b> We also examined whether the increased neuroinvasiveness of the virus mixture related to complementation between viruses in tissues of the nervous system, generation and selection of neuroinvasive recombinants, or both. It was found that, although neuroinvasive recombinant viruses could be detected in the <b>spinal</b> <b>cords</b> of the infected animals, most of the viruses (both recombinants and nonrecombinants) isolated from all tissues tested were nonneuroinvasive (i. e., no mice {{died as a result of}} footpad infection with high doses of such plaque-purified isolates).

40|$|The {{continued}} {{presence of}} virus-specific CD 8 + T cells within {{the central nervous}} system (CNS) following resolution of acute viral encephalomyelitis implicates organ-specific retention. The role of viral persistence in locally maintaining T cells was investigated by infecting mice with either a demyelinating, paralytic (V- 1) or nonpathogenic (V- 2) variant of a neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus, which differ in the ability to persist within the CNS. Class I tetramer technology revealed more infiltrating virus-specific CD 8 + T cells during acute V- 1 compared to V- 2 infection. However, both total and virus-specific CD 8 + T cells accumulated at similar peak levels in <b>spinal</b> <b>cords</b> by day 10 postinfection (p. i.). Decreasing viral RNA levels in both brains and <b>spinal</b> <b>cords</b> following initial virus clearance coincided with an overall progressive loss of both total and virus-specific CD 8 + T cells. By 9 weeks p. i., T cells had largely disappeared from brains of both infected groups, consistent with the decline of viral RNA. T cells also completely disappeared from V- 2 -infected <b>spinal</b> <b>cords</b> coincident with the absence of viral RNA. By contrast, a significant number of CD 8 + T cells which contained detectable viral RNA were recovered from <b>spinal</b> <b>cords</b> of V- 1 -infected mice. The data indicate that residual virus from a primary CNS infection is a vital component in mediating local retention of both CD 8 + and CD 4 + T cells and that once minimal thresholds of stimuli are lost, T cells within the CNS cannot survive in an autonomous fashion...|$|R

5|$|In the {{majority}} of cases the damage results from physical trauma such as car accidents, gunshots, falls, or sports injuries, but it can also result from nontraumatic causes such as infection, insufficient blood flow, and tumors. Efforts to prevent SCI include individual measures such as using safety equipment, societal measures such as safety regulations in sports and traffic, and improvements to equipment. Known since ancient times to be a catastrophic injury and long believed to be untreatable, SCI has seen great improvements in its care since the middle of the 20th century.

In the present study, we explored the capacity of glatiramer acetate (GA, Copaxone) to affect the demyelination process and/or lead to remyelination in mice inflicted by chronic EAE, using both scanning electron microscopy and immunohistological methods. <b>Spinal</b> <b>cords</b> of untreated EAE mice revealed substantial demyelination accompanied by tissue destruction and axonal loss. In contrast, in <b>spinal</b> <b>cords</b> of GA-treated mice, in which treatment started concomitantly with disease induction (prevention), no pathology was observed.
