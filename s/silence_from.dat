5|$|Military bases {{repeatedly}} {{tried to}} call the Army Control Station in Hiroshima. The complete <b>silence</b> <b>from</b> that city puzzled the General Staff; they knew that no large enemy raid had occurred and that no sizable store of explosives was in Hiroshima at that time. A young officer was instructed to fly immediately to Hiroshima, to land, survey the damage, and return to Tokyo with reliable information for the staff. It was felt that nothing serious had taken place and that the explosion was just a rumor.|$|E

About 05:20 on 27 May, platoon commander Captain François Lecointre had lost radio contact with the posts, and drove to the bridge {{to find out what was}} happening; he was met by a Serb sentry in French uniform who attempted to take him prisoner. Lecointre quickly turned around and drove to Skenderija stadium, the headquarters of FREBAT4.|$|E
5|$|Political {{activism}} in American gay communities was {{transformed by the}} arrival of AIDS in the early 1980s. When gay men tried in several desperate measures to follow established political channels to bring attention to a disease that afflicted the most cast out members of society only to meet <b>silence</b> <b>from</b> the government, some used direct action tactics. AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), formed by Larry Kramer and others in 1987, was a response not only to government forces that downplayed or ignored the seriousness of AIDS in the United States, but also to a timid gay community who were not militant enough. Their first act was to march on Wall Street in New York City to protest the high price of AZT and the lack of other drugs to address HIV. They blocked morning rush hour traffic, a civil disobedience action in which several protesters were arrested, and the fledgling organization received national news coverage for their demonstration. ACT UP inspired the establishment of direct action groups Queer Nation, Pink Panthers and the Lesbian Avengers, that concentrated on gay and lesbian rights and protection.|$|E

25|$|In 1949, Smith kept up her {{personal}} assault on racism with , {{a collection of}} essays that attempted to identify, challenge and dismantle the Old South's racist traditions, customs and beliefs, warning that segregation corrupted the soul. She also emphasized the negative implications on the minds of women and children. Written in a confessional and autobiographical style that was highly critical of southern moderates, it met with something of a cruel <b>silence</b> <b>from</b> book critics and the literary community.|$|E
25|$|To {{determine}} if criticism against the women was justified, Sir Alan appointed both as project managers for this task. Claire, who reined in her aggressive side in response, earned praise from her team and Nick, while Lucinda received surprisingly good feedback about her leadership, even impressing Margaret. Of the two, Sugar held reservation that Lucinda lacked force of character {{to put her}} foot down, after she backed down from a suggestion to have manufacturers on both of Alpha's sales teams, hoping they could convey enthusiasm, when she was met by <b>silence</b> <b>from</b> Jennifer, Lindi and Raef.|$|E
25|$|On April 11, 2007, Steve Capus of NBC News, {{announced}} that MSNBC {{would no longer}} simulcast Imus in the Morning, effective immediately.

(and at the time presidential candidate) Barack Obama, and several high-profile NBC black personalities, including Al Roker previously a friendly guest on the show, opposed Imus's return. The absence and <b>silence</b> <b>from</b> Imus's frequent NBC guests Brian Williams, Andrea Mitchell, David Gregory, Chris Matthews and close friend Tim Russert was too obvious to ignore and foreshadowed NBC's future action.|$|E

25|$|Ovid's {{version of}} this story (Heroides 9) has Heracles under the erotic control of Iole. She {{specifically}} has Heracles wear women's clothing and perform women's work. Heracles at this time all the while is bragging about his heroic deeds. However, Deianira reminds him how he is dressed in feminine attire and Iole is wearing his clothing while carrying his club. Deianira ultimately urges <b>silence</b> <b>from</b> him. The same version shows the disgrace and shame of Heracles, who was once a strong warrior fighter, outwitted by Iole in being made to do effeminate acts. In this skillful crafty manner, she had avenged her father's death.|$|E
25|$|Shields' work at Scotland Yard also {{included}} investigations into Jamaican Yardie gangs, which work he began in 2001 {{as a member}} of the Yard's serious and organised crime unit, under the rubric of Operation Trident. He gained a reputation for expertise in this area, and later began playing a more international role as a result. Shields first came to Jamaica at the request of Allan Brown of London's Metropolitan Police Service to aid in the investigation of Reneto Adams and four other policemen charged with 7 May 2003 murder of four civilians at Kraal, Clarendon Parish. Shields was successful in breaking a wall of <b>silence</b> <b>from</b> the Jamaican police, persuading four officers to testify against their colleagues; however, the prosecutor was unable to secure a conviction, in an acquittal widely viewed as corrupt by the Jamaican public.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the mission, {{the crews}} were briefed that {{a minimum of}} 2000-3000 (possibly as high as 6000 or more) North Vietnamese regular army troops were encamped in the target area.

The raid did not start off well, as {{on the way to}} the target, two B-52Fs collided in midair during a refueling operation and 8 crew members were killed. An investigation later blamed the cause for the mid-air collision on a combination of poor staff planning, extremely unusual and unique weather conditions, forbidden radio communications and an untested air refueling operation. The next day, the press back in the United States generally derided the raid as being an expensive and costly failure, and it was claimed that only one water buffalo was killed and only 100 pounds of rice were destroyed.|$|E

25|$|An MP for {{the ruling}} Pakistan Peoples Party, Syed Mumtaz Alam Gillani, {{has come forward}} with {{testimony}} evidencing a purportedly serious security breach at the Marriott on the night between 16 and 17 September, several days before the bombing. Alam Gillani and two friends {{are said to have}} witnessed several large steel boxes being unloaded from a U.S. Embassy truck by a group of U.S. Marines and, according to someone at the hotel, transported to the fourth and fifth floors. Among the several people who witnessed this incident was Pakistan Peoples Party leader Sajjad Chaudhry. However, Alam Gilani {{was the only one who}} objected to and protested the apparent security breach taking place, but was met with <b>silence</b> <b>from</b> the American Marines. The hotel security staff did not respond to Alam Gilani's protests as they passively watched what was taking place, not being allowed to go near the boxes by the U.S. Marines. Alam Gilani has since denounced the newspaper account, asserting that he was merely making light conversation with the journalist; the newspaper, however, stands by its account. Pakistani authorities are also investigating this issue.|$|E
25|$|On 18 May 2016, the Congress of Morelos voted 20 to 6 {{to approve}} the {{constitutional}} change to legalize same-sex marriage. A constitutional change requires the ratification of at least 17 of the 33 municipalities in the state. The Government expected the ratification process to finish within a month. Governor Graco Ramírez welcomed {{the approval of the}} bill. The 33 municipalities had until 25 June 2016 to act on the constitutional change. If they did not act, then on 29 June the reform would be approved by constructive assent (<b>silence</b> <b>from</b> the authority with respect to a request, in this case, the reform from Congress). At the end of the process, a total of 17 municipalities had ratified the constitutional change and 15 had voted against ratification, while 1 municipality was awarded an extra week, although the clear majority being in favor meant that same-sex marriage would become legal in the state. The municipalities which voted in favor of the reform were Cuautla, Emiliano Zapata, Huitzilac, Jantetelco, Jiutepec, Puente de Ixtla, Temixco, Tetecala, Tlaquiltenango, Totolapan, Yautepec de Zaragoza and Yecapixtla. Additionally, the municipalities of Axochiapan, Cuernavaca, Mazatepec, Tepalcingo and Tlayacapan did not vote (constructive assent). The remaining municipalities voted against the change. The law was promulgated and published in the state's official gazette on 4 July 2016. It took effect on 5 July. The state adoption agency clarified that the law allows same-sex couples to adopt jointly; the adoption process is open to all spouses in Morelos.|$|E
