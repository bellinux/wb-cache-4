50|$|All models got new, flatter dash trim panels, {{black on}} the lower two trims and aluminum-look on the fancier two. Base models {{received}} the flatter stainless hubcaps, and Stepsides got new squared-off taillights with built-in backup lights and <b>side</b> <b>markers,</b> while the rear fenders were smoothed out where the old <b>side</b> <b>markers</b> were. Fuel doors were added on models equipped with a bed to hide the previously exposed fuel caps.|$|R
25|$|Pontiacs {{built in}} the late 1960s {{conformed}} to new U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. These included energy-absorbing interior parts such as steering columns, steering wheels, knobs and handles, dual-circuit hydraulic brake systems, shoulder belts, <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lights, and headrests.|$|E
25|$|Like all 1968 {{passenger}} vehicles {{sold in the}} United States, GTOs now featured front outboard shoulder belts (cars built after January 1, 1968) and <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lights. To comply with the new 1968 federal vehicle emissions standards, the GTO was now equipped with emissions controls.|$|E
25|$|Typically, bulbs of 21 to 27watts, {{producing}} 280 to 570 lumens (22 to 45 mean spherical candlepower) {{are used}} for stop, turn, reversing and rear fog lamps, while bulbs of 4 to 10W, producing 40 to 130lm (3 to 10 mscp) {{are used for}} tail lamps, parking lamps, <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lamps and side turn signal repeaters.|$|E

5000|$|The European (E-spec) and Asian (JDM) models {{had many}} {{differences}} versus the North American (A-spec) models. These include: raised turn signal <b>side</b> <b>markers</b> vs the A-Spec flush mounted <b>side</b> <b>markers,</b> small fog lights with silver bezels vs the A-Spec full fitting fog lights, different interior cloth patterns, projector headlamps (glass lenses), a 1.8-liter FP engine, and a hatchback model. Europe {{also received a}} diesel-engined version, using the [...] "Comprex" [...] pressure-wave supercharged RF engine seen in the previous generation JDM Capella. Power in Europe is [...] ECE at 4000 rpm, while the Japanese model claims [...] JIS at the same engine speed.|$|R
25|$|In 1966, Cadillac had {{its best}} annual sales yet, over 192,000 units (142,190 of them de Villes), an {{increase}} of more than 60%. This was exceeded in 1968, when Cadillac topped 200,000 units for the first time. 1967 and 1968 saw {{the introduction of a}} host of federally mandated safety features, including energy-absorbing steering columns and wheels, soft interior and instrument panel knobs and surfaces, front shoulder belts, and <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lights.|$|E
25|$|In Germany, the StVZO (Road Traffic Licensing Regulations) {{calls for}} a {{different}} function also known as parking lamps: With the vehicle's ignition switched off, the operator may activate a low-intensity light at the front (white) and rear (red) on either the left or {{the right side of}} the car. This function is used when parking in narrow unlit streets to provide parked-vehicle conspicuity to approaching drivers. This function, which is optional under UN and US regulations, is served passively and without power consumption in the United States by the mandatory <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> retroreflectors.|$|E
25|$|The Aura {{was a new}} styling {{direction}} for Saturn, with styling that resembled its cousin, the European Opel Vectra. All Aura models came standard with folding side mirrors and <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lights, lending to its European stylings. The design of the Aura Special appearance pieces included an integrated radio antenna in the rear window, a chrome appearance package available on XR models, standard 17inch wheels with five-spoke wheel covers and P225/50R17 all-season tires on XE models, and standard 18inch machined aluminum 14-spoke wheels on the XR with high-performance Goodyear Eagle LS2 P225/50R18 T tires.|$|E
50|$|X-ray Markers, {{also known}} as: {{anatomical}} <b>side</b> <b>markers,</b> Pb markers, lead markers, x-ray lead markers, or radiographic film identification markers, {{are used to}} mark x-ray films, both in hospitals and in industrial workplaces (such as on aeroplane parts and motors). They are used on radiographic images to determine anatomical side of body, date of the procedure, and may include patients name.|$|R
50|$|The first-generation LHS, sold in Europe {{with the}} New Yorker {{nameplate}} during the 1995-1997 model years, featured rear amber turn signals, rear fog lights, side turn signal repeaters, lack of <b>side</b> <b>markers,</b> and headlamps that incorporated different lens geometry and bulbs.|$|R
5000|$|Models {{for export}} to the United States were fitted with three-point seat belts, <b>side</b> <b>markers</b> {{and a number}} of engine {{modifications}} to comply with Federal emission standards, including air injection, carbon canister for evaporative emission control and a different exhaust system. On US-specification cars power was down to [...]|$|R
25|$|In most countries, cars must be {{equipped}} with side-mounted turn signal repeaters to make the turn indication visible laterally (i.e. {{to the sides of}} the vehicle) rather than just to the front and rear of the vehicle. These are permitted, but not required in the US. As an alternative in both the United States and Canada, the front amber <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lights may be wired to flash with the turn signals, but this also is not mandatory. In recent years, many automakers have been incorporating side turn signal devices into the side view mirror housings, rather than mounting them on the vehicle's fenders. Some evidence suggests these mirror-mounted turn signals may be more effective than fender-mounted items.|$|E
25|$|Cars are {{typically}} fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights, {{which are used}} to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, daytime running lights; red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-coloured reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lights) to increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on {{the ceiling of the}} car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a trunk light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.|$|E
25|$|The 1970 Nova was {{basically}} a carryover from 1969. The <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> and taillight lenses for the 1970 Nova were wider and positioned slightly differently. This was the final year for the SS396 (actually, a 402 cubic in. engine now). All other engines were carried over including the seldom-ordered four-cylinder which was in its final year. The car finally became simply the Chevrolet Nova this year {{after two years of}} transitional nameplates (Chevy II Nova in 1968 and Chevrolet Chevy Nova in 1969). Out of 254,242 Novas sold for 1970, 19,558 were the SS 350 or SS 396 version. Approximately 177 Central Office Production Order (COPO) Novas were ordered, with 175 converted by Yenko Chevrolet. The other two were sold in Canada. The Nova was used in Trans-Am racing this year.|$|E
5000|$|Changes for the 1968 model {{increased}} safety with a two-spoke energy-absorbing steering wheel, {{along with}} newly introduced shoulder belts. Other changes included {{front and rear}} <b>side</b> <b>markers,</b> [...] "FORD" [...] lettering removed from hood, rearview mirror moved from frame to windshield, a 302 cuin L V8 engine was now available, and C-Stripe graphics were added.|$|R
5000|$|Marking wingers {{and other}} attacking players. Full-backs {{generally}} do not commit into challenges in their opponents' half. However, they aim to quickly dispossess attacking players who have already breached the defensive line with a sliding tackle from the <b>side.</b> <b>Markers</b> must however avoid keeping too tight on opponents or risk disrupting the defensive organisation.|$|R
2500|$|In MY06 {{the first}} {{exterior}} update was applied {{with a slight}} face-lift of front fascia, tail lamps. Some other slight differences {{can be found on}} the [...] "Supercharged" [...] variant. The second exterior update was in 2010, bringing a true modern feel to the L322 with new fascia, tail lamps, side grills, and clear <b>side</b> <b>markers.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the US, amber {{front and}} red rear <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lamps and retroreflectors are required. The law {{initially}} required lights or retroreflectors on vehicles made after 1 January 1968. This was amended to require lights and retroreflectors on vehicles made after 1 January 1970. These side-facing devices make the vehicle's presence, position {{and direction of}} travel clearly visible from oblique angles. The lights are wired so as to illuminate whenever the vehicles' parking and taillamps are on, including when the headlamps are being used. Front amber side markers in the United States may be wired so as to flash in synchronous phase or opposite-phase with the turn signals, but {{are not required to}} flash at all. Side markers are permitted but not required on cars and light passenger vehicles outside the US and Canada. If installed, they are required to be brighter and visible through a larger horizontal angle than US side markers, may flash only in synchronous phase with the turn signals (but are not required to flash), and they must be amber at the front and rear, except rear side markers may be red if they are grouped, combined, or reciprocally incorporated with another rear lighting function that is required to be red.|$|E
25|$|The VAM Javelin saw {{considerable}} aesthetic {{changes with}} only minor technical ones. The VAM models included the same novelties as its AMC counterpart, {{such as new}} headlight bezels and grille, smooth front fender extensions and bumpers without divisions, larger tail lights without wraparound portions and a single central back-up light, larger <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lights with both light and reflector sections in both amber and red, and new wheel cover designs resembling Magnum 500 wheels. The discontinuation of the central rear reflector {{in favor of the}} back-up light resulted in the addition of a fourth Javelin emblem placed on the right corner of the trunk lid. Two hood designs were available, the one with the Ram Air-type scoops at the front center, and a smoother one with the two rectangular stripped bulges. Despite this, no Ram Air system was ever offered for the car, at least at a factory level. In the interior, a new collapsible steering column with built-in ignition switch and anti-theft lock plus a new simulated two-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central bulls eye emblem were present. A secondary anti-theft mechanism was present {{in the form of the}} floor-mounted shifters being linked to the ignition switch regardless of the transmission type. AMC's new dashboard design included full woodgrain surfaces, complete with a new center console and shifter design for the automatic transmission. However, all three gauges were still the same as in the previous two years. New door panels were also included.|$|E
2500|$|Regular Chevelle engines {{started with}} a [...] Turbo-Thrift six or the new [...] Turbo-Fire 307 V8, and a [...] version of the 327-cubic-inch V8. Manual {{transmission}} cars got GM's [...] "Air Injection Reactor (A.I.R)" [...] smog pump. New Federal safety-mandated equipment included <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lights, as well as shoulder belts for outboard front seat occupants on cars built after December 1, 1967.|$|E
25|$|The {{pedestrian}} entrance remains {{near the}} bridge on the A661, {{with the original}} gate and nameboard brackets. The bridges {{on either side of}} the station bear a notice issued by British Rail in 1987 stating that the trackbed still belongs to British Rail. Line <b>side</b> <b>markers</b> remain dotted about the old trackbed. Following closure, the station site was used as a car park.|$|R
5000|$|The 480 was {{produced}} in Born, Netherlands, at the factory that built DAF cars, including the DAF 66 based Volvo 66, and later, the Volvo 300 Series. The 480 shared the platform of the Volvo 440 and 460 models. It was originally planned for the North American market (evidenced by its front and rear <b>side</b> <b>markers,</b> not used on European automobiles).|$|R
50|$|The 1995-1997 LHS {{was sold}} in Europe with the New Yorker {{nameplate}} and featured rear amber turn signals, rear fog lamps, side turn signal repeaters, and headlamps that incorporated different lens geometry and bulbs, The <b>side</b> <b>markers</b> were deleted. 1996-1997 LHS exports to South Korea and the Middle East likewise bore the New Yorker nameplate. South Korean exports looked like a European New Yorker, Middle East exports like an American LHS.|$|R
2500|$|... "Front {{position}} lamps", {{known as}} [...] "parking lamps" [...] or [...] "parking lights" [...] in the US, Canada and Australia and [...] "front sidelights" [...] in the UK provide nighttime standing-vehicle conspicuity. They {{were designed to}} use little electricity, {{so they could be}} left on for periods of time while parked. Despite the UK term, these {{are not the same as}} the <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lights described below.|$|E
2500|$|The car {{incorporated}} several safety innovations including interior windshield posts {{that were}} [...] "the first industry use of fiberglass safety padding", and the flush-mounted paddle-style door handles. To comply with National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) safety standards there were exterior <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lights, and three-point seat belts and headrests {{for the front}} seats, while the interior was devoid of bright trim to help reduce glare.|$|E
2500|$|The show {{also used}} 1968 Chargers (which {{shared the same}} sheet metal) by {{changing}} the grille and taillight panel to the 1969 style, and removing the round <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lights. These Chargers performed many record-breaking jumps throughout the show, {{almost all of them}} resulting in a completely destroyed car. [...] The 1970 Chargers were modified by removing the chrome bumper and changing the taillights.|$|E
50|$|W202s in North America {{included}} the C 220 (later {{replaced by the}} C 230), C 280 (both I6 and V6) and the AMG variants. It was launched in the U.S. in November 1993, and unlike models in Europe, featured a third stop light, no specific trim levels, and <b>side</b> <b>markers</b> integrated into the front-turn signals. The top speed was also electronically limited to 130 mi/h km/h in the US due to tire speed restrictions.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, the Ranger {{received}} minor updates to the grille, hood, {{and front}} bumper. New front bucket seats were also added in 2004 {{to meet the}} new U.S. Federal safety requirements. It retained the dashboard lines of the previous years trucks with an instrument cluster change. In 2006, the Ranger received more minor updates to the grille, front <b>side</b> <b>markers</b> and taillights, along with a bigger rear Ford logo that was now centered in the tailgate. It also received new larger mirrors {{similar to those found}} on other Ford trucks and SUVs.|$|R
5000|$|... 2006 MY - On ZX4, ZX3 and ZX5, {{standard}} CD/MP3 {{player on}} all models, S and SE models receive revised plastic wheel covers with alloy wheels now {{available as a}} standalone option, six-disc audio systems now have steering-wheel controls, convenience Package and Safety Packages bundle popular options. Also in 2006 Ford introduced the Street Appearance Package priced at US$1295 with two unique front and rear fascia choices. The front fascia included integrated fog lamps and <b>side</b> <b>markers,</b> while the rear offers a rear diffuser, with the option of a large rally-style spoiler.|$|R
