25|$|Tensor {{calculus}} {{really came}} to life, however, {{with the advent}} of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity in 1915. A few years after this, Levi-Civita formalized the unique connection associated to a Riemannian metric, now known as the Levi-Civita connection. More general affine connections were then studied around 1920, by Hermann Weyl, who developed a detailed mathematical foundation for general relativity, and Élie Cartan, who made the link with the geometrical ideas coming from <b>surface</b> <b>theory.</b>|$|E
25|$|The points just raised are {{easiest to}} explain in reverse, {{starting}} from the motivation provided by <b>surface</b> <b>theory.</b> In this situation, although the planes being rolled over the surface are tangent planes in a naive sense, {{the notion of a}} tangent space is really an infinitesimal notion, whereas the planes, as affine subspaces of , are infinite in extent. However these affine planes all have a marked point, the point of contact with the surface, and they are tangent to the surface at this point. The confusion therefore arises because an affine space with a marked point can be identified with its tangent space at that point. However, the parallel transport defined by rolling does not fix this origin: it is affine rather than linear; the linear parallel transport can be recovered by applying a translation.|$|E

40|$|Noninteracting {{insulating}} electronic {{states of}} matter {{can be classified}} according to their symmetries in terms of topological invariants which {{can be related to}} effective <b>surface</b> <b>theories.</b> These effective <b>surface</b> <b>theories</b> are in turn topologically protected against the effects of disorder. Topological crystalline insulators are, on the other hand, trivial {{in the sense of the}} above classification but still possess surface modes. In this paper we consider an extension of the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model that describes a point group insulator. We explicitly show that the surface properties of this state can be as robust as in topologically nontrivial insulators but only if the S-z component of the spin is conserved. However, in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling this protection vanishes, and the surface states localize, even if the crystalline symmetries are intact on average...|$|R
40|$|An {{engineering}} {{prediction method}} {{for determining the}} longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of wing-body-tail combinations is developed. The method includes the effects of nonlinear aerodynamics of components and the interference between components. Nonlinearities associated with symmetrical vortex shedding from {{the nose of the}} body are considered as well as the nonlinearities associated with the separation vortices from the leading edges and side edges of the lifting surfaces. The wing and tail characteristics are calculated using lifting <b>surface</b> <b>theories</b> which include effects of incidence, camber, twist, and induced velocities from external sources of disturbance such as bodies and vortices. The lifting <b>surface</b> <b>theories</b> calculate the distribution of leading edge and side edge suction which is converted to vortex lift using the Polhamus suction analogy. Correlation curves are developed to determine the fraction of the theoretical suction force which is converted into vortex lift. The prediction method is compared with experimental data on a variety of aircraft configurations to assess the accuracy and limitations of the method...|$|R
2500|$|A smooth {{manifold}} is {{a mathematical}} object which looks locally like a smooth deformation of Euclidean space : for example a smooth curve or surface looks locally like a smooth deformation {{of a line}} or a plane. Smooth functions and vector fields can be defined on manifolds, just as they can on Euclidean space, and scalar functions on manifolds can be differentiated in a natural way. However, differentiation of vector fields is less straightforward: this is a simple matter in Euclidean space, because the tangent space of based vectors at a point [...] can be identified naturally (by translation) with the tangent space at a nearby point [...] On a general manifold, {{there is no such}} natural identification between nearby tangent spaces, and so tangent vectors at nearby points cannot be compared in a well-defined way. The notion of an affine connection was introduced to remedy this problem by connecting nearby tangent spaces. The origins of this idea {{can be traced back to}} two main sources: <b>surface</b> <b>theory</b> and tensor calculus.|$|E
