In order to maintain the performance, it is necessary to scale down the threshold voltage.

The results confirm that, due to technology scaling, the leakage power is becoming a major component of power dissipation. The distribution of this power has not been previously studied, and we found that it is greatly asymmetric about the mean, rather more than the delay distribution, due to variability in the devices. Its implication is that some of the devices could even dissipate more than 340 % of the mean power and thus further reduces the yield due to unacceptable power losses for the devices which are otherwise delay efficient. It is therefore possible that localized heating, and variations in characteristics introduced by it, could affect the reliability of the system, although further characterization is necessary to determine the magnitude of these effects in system performance.
