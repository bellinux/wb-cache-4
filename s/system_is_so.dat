Few other {{disciplines}} outside history deal with the time before year 1, some exceptions being dendrochronology, archaeology and geology, the latter two of which use 'years before the present'. Although the absolute numerical values of astronomical and historical years only differ by one before year 1, this difference is critical when calculating astronomical events like eclipses or planetary conjunctions to determine when historical events which mention them occurred.|$|E

According to Knuth, it was first used by Gene Amdahl, Elaine M. McGraw (née Boehme), and Arthur Samuel in 1954, in an assembler program for the IBM 701 computer. The first published description of linear probing is by , who also credits Samuel, Amdahl, and Boehme but adds that [...] "the <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> natural, that it very likely may have been conceived independently by others either before or since that time". Another early publication of this method was by Soviet researcher Andrey Ershov, in 1958.|$|E

While describing security measures taken by U.S. and foreign governments {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the attack, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, said, [...] "once the incident occurred, the system worked." [...] She cited [...] "the actions of the passengers and the crew on this flight" [...] to show [...] "why that <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> important." [...] After heavy criticism, she stated the following day that the system [...] "failed miserably", this time referring to Abdulmutallab's boarding the flight with an explosive device. U.S. President Barack Obama called the U.S.'s failure to prevent the bombing attempt [...] "totally unacceptable", and ordered an investigation.|$|E

500|$|Chinese has a {{large number}} of nominal classifiers; {{estimates}} of the number in Mandarin range from [...] "several dozen" [...] or [...] "about 50", to over 900. The range is so large because some of these estimates include all types of classifiers while others include only count-classifiers, and because the idea of what constitutes a [...] "classifier" [...] has changed over time. Today, regular dictionaries include 120 to 150 classifiers; the 8822-word Syllabus of Graded Words and Characters for Chinese Proficiency (...) lists 81; and a 2009 list compiled by Gao Ming and Barbara Malt includes 126. The number of classifiers that are in everyday, informal use, however, may be lower: linguist Mary Erbaugh has claimed that about two dozen [...] "core classifiers" [...] account for most classifier use. As a whole, though, the classifier <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> complex that specialized classifier dictionaries have been published.|$|E
500|$|Kepler-14b's host star is {{the primary}} (A) {{component}} of the Kepler-14 binary system. [...] However, because the binary <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> closely knit, it was impossible {{at the time of}} Kepler-14b's discovery to distinguish the characteristics of each individual star. If the Kepler-14 system was an individual star, it would be an F-type star. With an apparent magnitude of 12.12, the star system is not visible from Earth with the naked eye. Kepler-14's combined results resemble that of a star that is 1.512 solar masses and 2.048 solar radii. Its gyrochronological age, or its age as determined by the rate at which a star spins, is estimated at 2.2 billion years, far younger than the Sun. It is also hotter, with an effective temperature of 6395 K. With a metallicity of 0.12, Kepler-14 has 132% more iron than the amount measured in the Sun.|$|E

The Department of Veterans Affairs did not dispute this number, but said that disciplinary action is being taken against over 100 other employees. Congressional Republicans were outraged. Representative Jeff Miller said. [...] "“Rather than disciplining bad employees, V.A. often just transfers them to other V.A. facilities or puts them on paid leave for months on end," [...] and [...] "“Everyone knows accountability is a major problem at the department." [...] Miller said that he would introduce new legislation to hasten the firing process. Raymond Kelley, legislative director for Veterans of Foreign Wars, said that “The government firing <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> cumbersome bad employees can continue to be paid for years,” and “We need to show them you can no longer hide just because you have a government job, unclog the middle management that appears {{to be part of the}} problem and get the right people in those positions.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In a {{groundbreaking}} 1976 paper, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman proposed {{the notion of}} public-key (also, more generally, called asymmetric key) cryptography in which two different but mathematically related keys are used—a public key and a private key. A public key <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> constructed that calculation of one key (the 'private key') is computationally infeasible from the other (the 'public key'), {{even though they are}} necessarily related.

2500|$|Decided by the US Supreme Court in 2002 {{this case}} [...] held that even {{requests}} for accommodation {{that might seem}} reasonable on their face, e.g., a transfer to a different position, can be rendered unreasonable because it would require {{a violation of the}} company's seniority system. [...] While the court held that in general a violation of a seniority system renders an otherwise reasonable accommodation unreasonable a plaintiff can present evidence that despite the seniority system the accommodation is reasonable in the specific case at hand, e.g., the plaintiff could offer evidence that the seniority <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> often disregarded that another exception wouldn't make a difference.|$|E
2500|$|In {{cases where}} an enolization is {{occurring}} around an allylic group (usually {{as part of}} a cyclic system), A1,3 strain can cause the reaction to be nearly impossible. [...] In these situations, acid treatment would normally cause the alkene to become protonated, moving the double bond to the carboxylic group, changing it to a hydroxy group. [...] The resulting allylic strain between the alcohol and the other group involved in the allylic <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> great that the reaction can not occur under normal thermodynamic conditions. [...] This same enolization occurs much more rapidly under basic conditions, as the carboxylic group is retained in the transition state and allows the molecule to adopt a conformation that does not cause allylic strain.|$|E

But what testicular cancer taught me is that the NHS will probably let you down if you need screening, fast diagnosis and an operation at a time that suits you". He supports reform within the NHS, saying that its resources have become stretched due to increased immigration, and blaming Labour for high costs of new hospitals built through private finance initiatives.|$|E

He meets men there who'll be useful to him later, and he keeps himself in touch with what's going on while he's studying for his profession. The town-birds--such as the chemist's assistant, clerk, plumber, mechanic, electrician, and so forth--generally put in for their town Volunteer corps as soon as they begin to walk out with the girls.

This {{arrangement}} of the virtues was, however, productive of infinite confusion and error: in the first place, because Faith is classed with its own fruits,--the gift of God, which {{is the root of}} the virtues, classed simply as one of them; in the second, because the words used by the ancients to express the several virtues had always a different meaning from the same expressions in the Bible, sometimes a more extended, sometimes a more limited one. Imagine, for instance, the confusion which must have been introduced into the ideas of a student who read St. Paul and Aristotle alternately; considering that the word which the Greek writer uses for Justice, means, with St. Paul, Righteousness. And lastly, it is impossible to overrate the mischief produced in former days, as well as in our own, by the mere habit of reading Aristotle, whose <b>system</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> false, so forced, and so confused, that the study of it at our universities is quite enough to occasion the utter want of accurate habits of thought which so often disgraces men otherwise well-educated. In a word, Aristotle mistakes the Prudence or Temperance which must regulate the operation of the virtues, for the essence of the virtues themselves; and, striving to show that all virtues are means between two opposite vices, torments his wit to discover and distinguish as many pairs of vices as are necessary to the completion of his system, not disdaining to employ sophistry where invention fails him.|$|E
