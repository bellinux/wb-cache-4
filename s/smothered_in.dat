5|$|Qidra is a rice dish {{named after}} the clay vessel and oven it is baked in. Rice is cooked with pieces of meat inside of the vessel, often using lamb, whole garlic cloves, {{garbanzo}} beans, cardamom pods, and various other spices such as, turmeric, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and cumin. Plain rice cooked in meat or chicken broth and flavored with mild spices including cinnamon is known as fatteh ghazzawiyyeh. The rice is layered over a thin markook bread known as farasheeh, <b>smothered</b> <b>in</b> ghee and topped with stuffed chicken or lamb. The meal is eaten with green peppers and lemon sauce.|$|E

25|$|The Mezquital Valley has best {{preserved}} the state’s indigenous, especially Otomi, culinary heritage based {{a number of}} traditional native animal and vegetable products. One {{of these is the}} use of a number of edible insects, many of which are considered delicacies such as escamoles (ant eggs) and maguey larvae as well as others such as larvae found on nopal plants, “chacas” (beetles) and “chicharras” (cicadas). Other local animals still used for food include tadpoles (called atepocates), salamanders and their larvae, squirrels and rabbits. Plant species still commonly used include mesquite beans, nopal and other cactus, and various cactus fruit such as “tunas” (cactus pears) and “xoconostle.” These are often prepared in dishes that the state shares with {{most of the rest of}} Mexico such as tacos, tamales, moles and a specialty of central Mexico, mixiote. Another common central Mexican dish popular in the state is barbacoa. This dish has its origins in the pre-Hispanic period, when it was meat cooked in an underground pit. Today, it is most often cooked in pots in more conventional ovens, but the meat, today mostly pork, is still <b>smothered</b> <b>in</b> the alcoholic beverage pulque and wrapped in maguey leaves for flavor. This preparation of barbacoa is considered to be the state dish.|$|E

In {{the first stage of}} her work, he sees in stories such as The Tale of Peter Rabbit a type of Jack-the-Giant-Killer theme, in which a small creature confronts a large creature that he believes culminates in The Tale of Jeremy Fisher. Potter places Jeremy Fisher in a dangerous world, according to Carpenter. The fishing experience is frightening: the bank-side creatures [...] worry him, the stickleback threatens him directly, and the trout tries to swallow him. But Potter makes the point that all creatures are prey, ending the story with Jeremy Fisher himself eating a grasshopper <b>smothered</b> <b>in</b> lady-bird sauce.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Alive or Just Breathing was generally positive. Erik Thomas from Metalreview.com said [...] "while this album certainly {{is responsible for}} the vast amount of saturation, it stands as a pretty trendsetting, stellar must-own example of metalcore." [...] Jason D. Taylor of AllMusic stated [...] "This is a pure metal album that seemingly has ignored any fashionable trend and instead relies solely on skill and expertise to sculpt some of meatiest heavy metal since the glory days of Metallica and Slayer." [...] Taylor also expressed the impressiveness of the band's [...] "do-it-yourself" [...] work ethic as Dutkiewicz handled all production and D'Antonio [...] "took the time to give much thought on the album's packaging and art direction." [...] Dom Lawson of Kerrang! magazine gave the album five [...] "Ks" [...] (or five out of five stars). He praised the album's unique new sound, music, and vocal performances from Leach. Kevin Boyce of CMJ said, [...] "This album is more addictive than crack cocaine that's been <b>smothered</b> <b>in</b> caffeine and nicotine and drenched with chocolate. Starting with the track 'Numbered Days,' this 12-track platter never takes its foot off of the throttle." [...] Boyce also stated his favorite song from the album was [...] "My Last Serenade," [...] and applauded [...] "Just Barely Breathing," [...] comparing parts of it to Metallica's Ride the Lightning.|$|E
500|$|In 1945, O'Hara starred {{opposite}} Paul Henreid in The Spanish Main as feisty noblewoman Contessa Francesca, {{the daughter}} of a Mexican viceroy. O'Hara described it as [...] "one of my more decorative roles", as her character is a particularly aggressive one among the men on a ship, and {{during the course of the}} film her face is <b>smothered</b> <b>in</b> chimney soot. O'Hara almost did not win the role when another actress falsely told RKO executive Joe Nolan that she was [...] "as big as a horse" [...] after giving birth to a daughter in 1944. Around this time [...] "an actress named Kathryn" [...] also falsely accused O'Hara of making sexual advances towards her in an elevator, which she believed was a way for the actress to gain attention at the start of her career. During the production of The Spanish Main, O'Hara was visited by John Ford, who was initially turned away for being shabbily dressed, but was later admitted to informing her about the project that would become The Quiet Man (1952). Malone notes that in the film O'Hara [...] "shows her determination not to leave her sexuality at the birthing stool", commenting that she looks [...] "deliciously fragrant in the splashy histrionics on view here, in RKO's first film in the three-color Technicolor process" [...] O'Hara became a naturalized citizen of the United States on 24 January 1946, and held dual citizenship with the US and her native Ireland.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{covers and}} {{performances}} for the episode were mostly well received by critics and fans alike. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly stated that her favorite was [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] by Paul McCartney, {{performed by the}} Warblers. In {{a review of the}} performance, she wrote, [...] "This is much more Warbler-esque than 'When I Get You Alone'. I had also been worried we wouldn't get our weekly dose of dorky Warbler dance moves. Plus, major points for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment when Blaine sang the love 'won't come at all' line to Santana. It was probably my personal biggest laugh-out-loud moment of the episode." [...] She gave the performance an [...] "A". She also praised Puck's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", and opined, [...] "In general, I'm in love with Mark Salling's voice. He's right up there with Artie [...] in my book. And this song was <b>smothered</b> <b>in</b> awesome sauce. Bonus points for Puck's sort-of-feminine head bob, Brittany's background groovin', the club's reactions to him singing to Lauren, and Mr. Schu's mild eye-roll." [...] She went on to give the performance an [...] "A−". Kristin Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer was a bit more critical of Puck's cover of the song: [...] "This week Mark Salling [...] is singing Queen's 'Fat Bottomed Girls'. I know this song fits in with Puck's storyline for the episode, but I feel like the song was in the wrong key for him. At times it sounded like he was straining to hit the higher notes. Because of this, I have to wonder if the backing vocals are purposely drowning his voice out. It seems depending on the song selection for him, Salling's vocal performances continue to be very hit or miss this season." ...|$|E
