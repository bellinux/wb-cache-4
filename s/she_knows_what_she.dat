[...] You're gonna learn a lot more about her as a person. The show is gonna be really about how she's {{becoming}} a woman, how she's finding herself and her independence. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants to do, she knows who she wants to be, and that's what the show's about." ...|$|E
500|$|Margaret has an alto vocal range. The Polish {{music critic}} Robert Kozyra {{described}} her voice as [...] "small" [...] {{and added that}} her [...] "weak" [...] live performances reveal her limited vocal capabilities. In contrast, Polish music manager Maja Sablewska stated that Margaret has a [...] "beautiful" [...] timbre and interprets her lyrics indicating that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is singing about. In the single [...] "Cool Me Down", Margaret's vocal range covers around one-and-a-half octaves from G4 to C6. Her vocals were compared to Rihanna's, and some listeners went on to accuse the singer of trying to copy her to which she responded: [...] "In lower registers my timbre is indeed similar to Rihanna's... I will not apologise for that." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] was {{recorded}} in 2008 at Rocky Mountain Recorders in Denver, Colorado. Speaking to Nick Levine of Digital Spy, Rihanna explained: [...] "I went into the studio making music my way. I found myself all at once." [...] In an interview on This Morning, Rihanna said that the song is not necessarily about a specific personal experience, but rather the general feelings of mental anguish, anxiety and confusion. Rihanna further explained {{that she wanted to}} record the song because she felt that listeners would be able to relate to the subject matter. When Good Girl Gone Bad was repackaged, Rihanna approached L.A. Reid, boss of Def Jam, suggesting to release [...] "Disturbia" [...] as a single and follow-up to [...] "Take a Bow". Speaking to MTV News, Reid said, [...] "It was the first time Rihanna actually came to me and said, 'Here's the song I want to put out.' She played me the song. That was her taking control [...] She understands what hits are, and <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants to say. She's at that place where she can do that." ...|$|E

60|$|She {{was old and}} feeble, {{small and}} thin--that's why {{everyone}} called her petite maman--but once <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> ought to do, then her spirit overpowered the weakness of her wizened body.|$|R
500|$|When {{the album}} was reissued, Rihanna {{approached}} L.A. Reid, the head of Def Jam Recordings and suggested {{that she wanted to}} release [...] "Disturbia" [...] as the next single. Speaking to MTV News, Reid said, [...] "It was the first time Rihanna actually came to me and said, 'Here's the song I want to put out.' She played me the song. That was her taking control [...] She understands what hits are, and <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants to say. She's at that place where she can do that." [...] It was solicited to US contemporary hit radio on June 17, 2008, and was released as a CD single in the United Kingdom on July 22, 2008. [...] "Disturbia" [...] earned Rihanna an award for Best International Song at the 2009 NRJ Music Awards. It peaked at number one in Belgium (Flanders) and New Zealand and became a top-ten hit in over twenty countries worldwide. The single topped the US Billboard Hot 100 chart for two consecutive weeks, and became Rihanna's third number one single from Good Girl Gone Bad and fourth overall on the Hot 100 chart. The music video for [...] "Disturbia" [...] was directed by Anthony Mandler and portrays Rihanna in various locations such as in a prison cell and gas chamber.|$|E
500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{regards to}} the humorous aspects of the character, Emily Exton of Entertainment Weekly stated that McCord had [...] "honed her comedic timing" [...] in the second season. Jethro Nededog {{expressed}} similar acclaim in a review for the Los Angeles Times, in which he commented on a comically driven Naomi, and asked, [...] "Is there anything better than Naomi when <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants?" [...] Nededog also lauded Naomi's material in the second season finale, citing the character's [...] "movement, activity and depth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ozma {{ordered the}} boy's arrest," [...] said Dorothy, [...] "and of course <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was doing. But {{if you can}} prove Ojo is {{innocent}} they will set him free at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Queer! By George, I'll {{back her}} for the queerest bit of {{horseflesh}} going any way about these diggings. I thought she was mad at first, but I believe <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not prudent, certainly, aunt," [...] Ellen replied, with {{a vacancy}} in her air, that proved how little <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was saying; [...] "and it is setting {{a very bad}} example to his sons." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} that she can? Do {{you think that}} <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wishes herself until the last moment, until it is too late?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Gilson observed, [...] "She's the dearest thing. We've become awfully fond of her. But I don't think <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{wants to}} do with life. She's rather at loose ends. Who is this Daggett boy--some {{university}} student--whom she seems to like?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Duncan {{thought the}} girl did look uncommonly as if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was talking about, and Mr. Duncan and Mr. Worthington had some such impression, too, as {{they stared at}} her. Cynthia's eyes flashed, but her voice was no louder than before.|$|R
50|$|Hayden Carruth {{wrote about}} The Everyday Uncommon: “It’s {{clear to me}} that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she’s</b> doing, <b>she’s</b> doing <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants to do, and she does it well.” The book has also {{received}} critical praise from Rhina Espaillat, R.

50|$|Beth Randall thought <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{was getting}} into when she mated the last pure blooded vampire on the planet: An easy ride was not it.

6000|$|... "Neither can I, more's the pity; {{nor does}} Whipple's woman savve the lingo. I {{got it from}} her. But her old man--he was full Russian, you know--he used to read it aloud to her. But <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> knows and what her old man knew, and so do I." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now he {{felt that}} in forming an opinion as to Mrs. Cliff's manner of living he had some grounds to stand upon. [...] "What she wants," [...] thought he, [...] "is all the solid, {{sensible}} comfort her money can give her, and where <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants, she gets it; but the trouble {{seems to be that}} in most things she doesn't know what she wants!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] Seaman interrupted, [...] "the Princess is a {{woman of}} the world. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is doing, and there is a {{definite}} tie between you. I tell you frankly that I could not bear to see you playing the idiot for a moment with Lady Dominey, but with the Princess, scruples don't enter into the question at all. You should by no means make an enemy of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] I {{answered}} reassuringly. [...] "I {{have not}} the slightest wish to run up against any of these people. I will not look at them any more. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was doing, though, Louis, when she hung blue stones about her with eyes like that, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{did like}} him, I fancy, in her calf days; {{but that means}} nothing. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> at now, bless you, and she'll look to the future. It's my son who'll have the Clavering {{property}} and be the baronet, not his. You see what a string to my bow that is." ...|$|R
60|$|Little Mary Morris stood forth valiant and excited. She {{was eleven}} years old, and {{intelligent}} {{enough to make}} it evident that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was about. The replies were full. The blows were described, with terrible detail of the occasions and implements. Still Rachel remembered the accusation of Mary's truth. She tried to doubt.|$|R
6000|$|... "She can't eat you. Remember {{that with}} her you needn't stand on your p's and q's, {{as you would}} with another woman. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is about, and will {{understand}} {{what she has to}} get as well as what she is expected to give. All I can say is, that if she accepts you, Hermy will consent that she shall go to Clavering as much as she pleases till the marriage takes place. It couldn't be done, I suppose, till after a year; and in that case she shall be married at Clavering." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If I know {{anything}} of heads,' he said, 'there's everything in that face but love. I {{shall have to}} put that in myself; and that chin and mouth won't be won for nothing. But she's right. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants, and she's going to get it. What insolence! Me! Of {{all the people in the}} wide world, to use me! But then she's Maisie. There's no getting over that fact; and it's good to see her again. This business must have been simmering at the back of my head for years.... She'll use me as I used Binat at Port Said.|$|E
6000|$|... "You wait a bit!" [...] sniggered his father. [...] "She {{is a good}} girl, is Laura, and <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is about. She's not a girl to let her old dad go to {{the wall}} if she can set him right. It's a pretty state of things," [...] he added bitterly: [...] "here's my {{daughter}} going to marry a man who thinks no more of gold than I used to of gun-metal; and here's my son going about with all the money he cares to ask for to help every ne'er-do-well in Staffordshire; and here's their father, who loved them and cared for them, and brought them both up, without money enough very often to buy a bottle of brandy. I don't know what your poor dear mother {{would have thought of}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Harman {{regarded}} {{the lord of}} her being and hesitated before <b>she</b> answered. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had to say would enrage him, but {{she had come to}} a point in their relationship when a husband's good temper is no longer a supreme consideration.

6000|$|We all {{smiled at}} the little mistake of Miss Opportunity, but it was of no great consequence; and I dare say <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant {{as well as most}} others who use the same term, though they spell it more accurately. [...] "Poodle usages" [...] are quite as {{applicable}} to anything now existing in America, as [...] "feudal usages." ...|$|R
6000|$|Flora's gentle voice carried {{conviction}} that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was saying, when, at last, they left {{a moment for}} her to speak--(Ethel would have done so long ago).

She's quite right. It will hurt a little. I shall have to see her every Sunday,--like a young man courting a housemaid. She's sure to come around; and yet--that mouth isn't a yielding mouth. I shall be wanting to kiss her all the time, and I shall have to look at her pictures,--I don't even know what sort of work she does yet,--and I shall have to talk about Art,--Woman's Art! Therefore, particularly and perpetually, damn all varieties of Art. It did me a good turn once, and now it's in my way. I'll go home and do some Art." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} other, [...] "I {{did not ask}} for it. The {{question}} of my vocation has been settled most admirably. There never was a human being more frank, more straightforward and pertinent than Miss Raybold. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants, and she makes her plans to get it. With regard to means she is sufficiently endowed, but the life work to which she has devoted herself is far more than she can ever accomplish alone. She needs the constant assistance of a sympathetic and appreciative nature, and that, I am happy to say, I am able to give to her; and were I to devote myself to any other calling which would interfere with that assistance, I should be doing her a positive wrong. Therefore, should I state it in definite words, I should say that I am to become my wife's private secretary. That is my position, and it suits me admirably; and I may add that Corona assures me that she is thoroughly well pleased. We are to be married in the fall, and I hope it will not be long before we shall have the pleasure of meeting again our former companions of the hermit camp." ...|$|E
60|$|The dogmatic objection, {{the sheer}} instinctive taboo which rules the subject out {{altogether}} as indecent, has no age limit. It means that at {{no matter what}} age a woman consents to a proposal of marriage, she should do so in ignorance of the relation she is undertaking. When this actually happens (and apparently it does happen oftener than would seem possible) a horrible fraud is being practiced on both {{the man and the}} woman. He is led to believe that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is promising, and that he is in no danger of finding himself bound to a woman to whom he is eugenically antipathetic. She contemplates nothing but such affectionate relations as may exist between her and her nearest kinsmen, and has no knowledge of the condition which, if not foreseen, must come as an amazing revelation and a dangerous shock, ending possibly in the discovery that the marriage has been an irreparable mistake. Nothing can justify such a risk. There may be people incapable of understanding that the right to know all {{there is to know about}} oneself is a natural human right that sweeps away all the pretences of others to tamper with one's consciousness in order to produce what they choose to consider a good character. But they must here bow to the plain mischievousness of entrapping people into contracts on which the happiness of their whole lives depends without letting them know what they are undertaking.|$|E

6000|$|It was {{a terrible}} shock. Some one, no doubt, was trying to set him against her. And should she betray Constance and her uncle?
