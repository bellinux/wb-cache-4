40|$|Mammalian {{epidermis}} {{consists of}} a basal layer of proliferative progenitors that gives rise to multiple differentiating layers to provide a waterproof envelope covering the skin surface. To accomplish this, progenitor cells must detach from the basal layer, move upward, and execute a terminal differentiation program consisting of three distinct stages: <b>spinous,</b> granular <b>layer,</b> and stratum corneum. Notch signaling has been implicated in late stages of differentiation, but the commitment switch remains unknown. Here we show with loss and gain-of-function studies that active Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and its obligate canonical signaling partner RBP-J act at the basal/suprabasal juncture to induce spinous and down-regulate basal fate. <b>Spinous</b> <b>layers</b> are absent in RBP-J conditional null epidermis and expanded when Notch 1 signaling is elevated transgenically in epidermis. We show that RBP-J is essential for mediating both spinous gene activation and basal gene repression. In contrast, the NICD/RBP-J target gene Hes 1 is expressed in <b>spinous</b> <b>layers</b> and mediates <b>spinous</b> gene induction but not basal gene repression. These data uncover an early role for RBP-J and Notch in commitment of epidermal cells to terminally differentiate and reveal that spinous gene induction is mediated by a Hes 1 -dependent mechanism, while basal gene repression occurs independently of Hes 1.

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the expression patterns of the newly discovered human β-defensin- 3 (hBD- 3) in human gingiva. Background: Human β-defensins (hBDs) are a group of small, broad-spectrum, cationic antimicrobial peptides. Our recent study showed that the expression levels of hBD- 1 and 2 peptides were associated with periodontal conditions. Methods: A total of 49 gingival biopsies were collected, including 33 samples from 21 patients with chronic periodontitis and 16 samples from 16 periodontally healthy subjects. The expression of hBD- 3 was detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Double staining was undertaken to identify hBD- 3 peptide-positive cells, using CD- 1 a and cytokeratin 20 as markers for Langerhans cells and Merkel cells, respectively. Results: hBD- 3 peptide was detected in 88 % of the samples, which was confined to the gingival epithelia. In healthy control subjects, hBD- 3 peptide was more frequently detected in the basal layer {{as compared to the}} patients (53 % vs. 18 %, p < 0. 05). In patients, hBD- 3 expression extended from the basal <b>layer</b> to the <b>spinous</b> <b>layers</b> (82 %), in which hBD- 3 was confined to the basal and deep <b>spinous</b> <b>layers</b> in clinically healthy tissues from patients, whereas it extended to the superficial <b>spinous</b> <b>layers</b> in pocket tissues from patients (0 % vs. 50 %, p < 0. 05). In both groups, hBD- 3 peptide was expressed not only in gingival keratinocytes, but also in Langerhans cells and Merkel cells. hBD- 3 transcripts were detected in 90 % of the samples and they were confined to the basal and/or suprabasal layers of gingival epithelia. Conclusions: This study shows that hBD- 3 is frequently expressed in gingival epithelia. The appropriate expression of hBD- 3 peptide may contribute to the maintenance of periodontal homeostasis, possibly through its antimicrobial effect and promotion of adaptive immune responses. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2005. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|A rat {{epidermal}} keratinocyte (REK) line which exhibits histodifferentiation {{nearly identical}} to the native epidermis when cultured at an air–liquid interface was used to study the metabolism of hyaluronan, the major intercellular macromolecule present in basal and <b>spinous</b> cell <b>layers.</b> Two different support matrices were used: reconstituted collagen fibrils with and without a covering basal lamina previously deposited by canine kidney cells. REKs formed a stratified squamous, keratinized epithelium on both support matrices. Hyaluronan and its receptor, CD 44, colocalized in the basal and <b>spinous</b> <b>layers</b> similar to their distribution in the native epidermis. Most (approximately 75 %) of the hyaluronan was retained in the epithelium when a basal lamina was present while most (approximately 80 %) diffused out of the epithelium in its absence. While REKs on the two matrices synthesized hyaluronan at essentially the same rate, catabolism of this macromolecule was much higher in the epithelium on the basal lamina (half-life approximately 1  day, similar to its half-life in native human epidermis). The formation of a true epidermal compartment in culture bounded by the cornified layer {{on the surface and}} the basal lamina subjacent to the basal cells provides a good model within which to study epidermal metabolism...|$|R

50|$|In {{the upper}} <b>spinous</b> <b>layer</b> and stratum granulosum {{layer of the}} epidermis, {{lamellar}} bodies are secreted from keratinocytes, resulting {{in the formation of}} an impermeable, lipid-containing membrane that serves as a water barrier and is required for correct skin barrier function. These granules release components that are required for skin shedding (desquamation) in the uppermost epidermal layer, the stratum corneum. These components include lipids (e.g. glucosylceramides), hydrolytic enzymes (e.g. proteases, acid phosphatases, glucosidases, lipases) and proteins (e.g. corneodesmosin). Lamellar granules have been observed to contain distinct aggregates of the secreted components glucosylceramide, cathepsin D, KLK7, KLK8 and corneodesmosin. Transportation of molecules via lamellar granules is thought to prevent enzymes from interacting with their relevant substrates or inhibitors prior to secretion.|$|E
50|$|Glis1 {{has been}} shown to be heavily up {{regulated}} in psoriasis, a disease which causes chronic inflammation of the skin. Normally, Glis1 is not expressed in the skin at all. However, during inflammation, it is expressed in the <b>spinous</b> <b>layer</b> of the skin, the second layer from the bottom of four layers as a response to the inflammation. This is the last layer where the cells have nuclei and thus the last layer where gene expression occurs. It is believed that the role of Glis1 in this disease is to promote cell differentiation in the skin by changing the increasing the expression of multiple pro-differentation genes such as IGFBP2 which inhibits proliferation and can also promote apoptosis It also decreases the expression of Jagged1, a ligand of notch in the notch signaling pathway and Frizzled10, a receptor in the wnt signaling pathway.|$|E

Objectives: This study aimed to determine the expression profiles of hBD- 1 and - 2 peptides in gingiva and to assess the possible relations of these antimicrobial peptides with periodontal health and disease. Methods: Seven periodontally healthy subjects and 22 patients with unresolved chronic periodontitis were recruited and the gingival biopsies collected consisted of healthy tissues from the healthy subjects (HT-C); periodontal pocket tissues (PoT) and inflamed connective tissues (ICT) from the base of pocket, i. e. granulation tissues, as well as clinically healthy tissues (HT-P) from the adjacent clinically healthy sites from the patients. The expression of hBD- 1 and - 2 peptides was detected by immunohistochemistry and quantitatively analyzed with a computerized image processing system. Results: Both hBD- 1 and - 2 peptides were detected in all periodontally healthy subjects, while hBD- 1 was detected in all patients and hBD- 2 was found in most of the patients. Their expression was mainly confined to the granular and <b>spinous</b> <b>layers</b> of gingival epithelium, in which hBD- 1 was detected in both intercellular spaces and cytoplasm, whereas hBD- 2 was mainly observed in the cytoplasm. HT-C expressed significantly higher levels of hBD- 2 than HT-P (p < 0. 05). Within the patients, both defensins were up-regulated significantly in PoT as compared with the adjacent HT-P (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: The present study showed that hBD- 1 and - 2 were frequently expressed in the granular and <b>spinous</b> <b>layers</b> of gingival epithelia and their expression may be associated with periodontal health and disease. © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2004. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} studies {{we have shown}} that experimental permeability barrier disruption leads {{to an increase in}} epidermal lipid and DNA synthesis. Here we investigate whether barrier disruption also influences keratins and cornified envelope proteins as major structural keratinocyte proteins. Cutaneous barrier disruption was achieved in hairless mouse skin by treatments with acetone ± occlusion, sodium dodecyl sulfate, or tape-stripping. As a chronic model for barrier disruption, we used essential fatty acid deficient mice. Epidermal keratins were determined by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, immunoblots, and anti-keratin antibodies in biopsy samples. In addition, the expression of the cornified envelope proteins loricrin and involucrin after barrier disruption was determined by specific antibodies in human skin. Acute as well as chronic barrier disruption resulted in the induction of the expression of keratins K 6, K 16, and K 17. Occlusion after acute disruption led to a slight reduction of keratin K 6 and K 16 expression. Expression of basal keratins K 5 and K 14 was reduced after both methods of barrier disruption. Suprabasal keratin K 10 expression was increased after acute barrier disruption and K 1 as well as K 10 expression was increased after chronic barrier disruption. Loricrin expression in mouse and in human skin was unchanged after barrier disruption. In contrast, involucrin expression, which was restricted to the granular and upper <b>spinous</b> <b>layers</b> in normal human skin, showed an extension to the lower <b>spinous</b> <b>layers</b> 24 h after acetone treatment. In summary, our results document that acute or chronic barrier disruption leads to expression of keratins K 6, K 16, and K 17 and to a premature expression of involucrin. We suggest that the coordinated regulation of lipid, DNA, keratin, and involucrin synthesis is critical for epidermal permeability barrier function...|$|R

Varying degrees of epithelial dysplasia may be present. However, no studies have correlated epithelial changes with cytokeratin expression that might reflect the disordered maturation that is probably occurring. Methods:  Thirty-four cases diagnosed as AC were classified according to dysplasia degree, and submitted to immunohistochemical staining {{for the detection of}} cytokeratins (CKs) 7, 8, 13, 14, 16 and 19. Normal mucosa adjacent to the lesions was also evaluated. Results:  The results obtained showed that CK 10 immunostained only superficial keratinized epithelial layers in 11 cases, and also intermediate <b>spinous</b> <b>layers</b> in 18 cases. Cytokeratin 14 was expressed in all epithelial layers of 31 cases, in two cases its expression was in the basal and intermediate layers, and one case was negative. Cytokeratin 13 immunostained 26 cases and was negative in eight cases. In these eight cases, CK 13 was apparently replaced by CK 16. Cytokeratin 16, besides these eight cases, was also expressed in the <b>spinous</b> intermediate <b>layers</b> of a further eight cases. The remaining CKs tested were all negative. No relation between the degree of dysplasia and the CK expression was noted.

This paper aims to provide a technique {{that can be used}} to assist the oral pathologists in grading OSF based on textural information of the <b>spinous</b> <b>layer.</b> The proposed scheme intends to evaluate the textural changes from normal to various grades of OSF. In practice, it comprises the following modules – (a) surface epithelium segmentation, (b) selection of windows on the <b>spinous</b> <b>layer</b> in reference to the basal layer, (c) textural feature extraction and analysis and finally (d) grading. Here the epithelium is segmented using anisotropic diffusion and Otsu’s thresholding. Wavelet based multi-resolution technique is applied to extract 12 textural features from <b>spinous</b> <b>layer.</b> From the statistical analysis, it is observed that 6 features are significant in discriminating normal, OSF with and without dysplasia. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) and Bayesian classifiers are trained with 46 normal, 24 OSF without dysplasia and 20 OSF with dysplasia samples for OSF grading. The result shows that the classification accuracies for both the classifiers (Bayesian = 93. 3 %, SVM = 96. 6 %) are comparable, there by emphasizing the significance of texture in oral cancer diagnostics...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{a normal}} {{stratified}} squamous epithelium, β 1 -integrin {{is expressed in}} basal epithelial cells. In BPV-induced fibropapillomas β 1 -integrin is overexpressed and aberrantly localized, with uniform expression in the lower <b>spinous</b> <b>layer,</b> and sporadic expression within the mid-spinous region that co-localizes with expression of the viral E 5 and E 7 oncoproteins. In situ hybridization of fibropapillomas for β 1 -integrin RNA revealed sporadic hybridization in the <b>spinous</b> <b>layer,</b> indicating transcriptional induction. β 1 -integrin expression in cultured keratinocytes requires exogenous EGF in the media, but this requirement is lost if E 7 is expressed, and E 7 was able to abrogate the EGF-requirement of normal keratinocytes for the activation of ERK and DNA synthesis. Within fibropapillomas, suprabasal expression of E 5 and E 7 correlated with suprabasal expression of β 1 -integrin and PCNA, indicating that vegetative viral replication in the <b>spinous</b> <b>layer</b> correlated with the expression of E 7 and β 1 integrin. The ability of BPV- 1 E 7 to support β 1 -integrin expression and EGF independent DNA synthesis and the activation of ERK are the first biochemical correlates of its expression in keratinocytes...|$|E
40|$|Epidermal {{stratification}} of the mammalian skin requires proliferative basal progenitors {{to generate}} intermediate cells that {{separate from the}} basal layer and are replaced by post-mitotic cells. Although Wnt signaling has been implicated in this developmental process, the mechanism underlying Wnt-mediated regulation of basal progenitors remains elusive. Here we show that Wnt secreted from proliferative basal cells is not required for their differentiation. However, epidermal production of Wnts {{is essential for the}} formation of the <b>spinous</b> <b>layer</b> through modulation of a BMP-FGF signaling cascade in the dermis. The <b>spinous</b> <b>layer</b> defects caused by disruption of Wnt secretion can be restored by transgenically expressed Bmp 4. Non-cell autonomous BMP 4 promotes activation of FGF 7 and FGF 10 signaling, leading to an increase in proliferative basal cell population.

RNAs containing the 7385 / 3605 and 3764 / 5609 splice junctions were confined to the granular cell layer. In contrast, RNAs containing the 7385 / 3225 splice junction were present in both the granular and <b>spinous</b> <b>layers.</b> The switch in splice site usage in the granular cell layer limits the expression of the mRNA encoding the major capsid protein to these most terminally differentiated cells.

40|$|Multiple {{protein kinase}} C (PKC) isoforms have been {{associated}} with the epidermal keratinocyte (KC) granular layer differentiation program. Here we show PKCα membrane localization and substrate phosphorylation in the first suprabasal KCs of normal human epidermis, suggesting activation in vivo in the lower <b>spinous</b> <b>layers</b> where terminal differentiation-associated growth arrest occurs. To determine if PKCα is sufficient for KC growth arrest, we expressed a constitutively active PKCα (PKCα Δ 22 – 28) in normal human KCs and observed growth arrest and accumulation of cells in G 1. PKCα Δ 22 – 28 inhibited DNA synthesis through the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p 21. Furthermore, downregulation of PKCα in an in vitro organotypic epidermis resulted in increased basal and suprabasal proliferation marker expression, decreased differentiation, and reduced epidermal stratification. Together these results indicate that PKCα activation is both necessary and sufficient to trigger irreversible growth arrest during human KC differentiation...|$|R

Methods Forty-one MC lesions {{were subjected to}} immunohistochemical technique to verify K 1, K 10, K 14, K 16, involucrin, filaggrin, E-cadherin and p 63 expression. MC immunolabeling pattern was compared to adjacent normal appearing epidermis (ANAE). Results In MC and ANAE, K 1 /K 10 were expressed in suprabasal layers, K 14 was expressed in basal and suprabasal layers and K 16 was expressed through all <b>spinous</b> <b>layer.</b> Involucrin and filaggrin were observed in granular, spinous and in basal layer of ANAE and MC. E-cadherin was present {{up to the first}} layers of MC while ANAE exhibited E-cadherin labeling at basal and spinous layers. Basal and spinous layers keratinocytes nuclei, in both MC and ANAE, express p 63. Conclusion Infection by Molluscipox virus alters keratinocyte differentiation status. The presence of K 14 and p 63 in <b>spinous</b> <b>layer,</b> as well as early expression of involucrin and filaggrin, associated to a hyperproliferative state disclosed by K 16 expression, may be a result of disruption in keratinocytes maturation process.

Activation of the low-affinity PGE 2 receptors {{is likely to be}} important in mediating the actions of the high levels of PGE 2 found in various pathologic processes. The pattern of expression of these receptors in epidermis, however, is unknown. We therefore examined the immunolocalization of the EP 1 and EP 2 receptors in human epidermis. The EP 1 and EP 2 receptors demonstrated both plasma membrane and perinuclear or nuclear staining within the basal and spinous layers. Within the granular layer, both receptors were expressed in the cytoplasm with a grainy or granular appearance. The major differences were that the EP 2 receptor demonstrated a zone of decreased to absent plasma membrane staining in the superficial <b>spinous</b> <b>layer</b> and only scattered cellular staining within the granular layer. In contrast, the EP 1 receptor was prominently expressed throughout the stratum granulosum and the plasma membrane staining pattern was seen throughout the <b>spinous</b> <b>layer.</b> In cultured primary human keratinocytes, we also verified the presence of functional EP 1 receptor coupled to intracellular calcium mobilization and EP 2 receptor coupled to cAMP production...|$|E

40|$|Keratinocyte {{apoptosis}} {{mediated by}} Fas/Fas ligand molecular interactions and subsequent caspase activation {{is believed to}} play an important role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD), in particular for the formation of spongiosis. To estimate epidermal caspase activation in normal and AD skin under in vivo conditions, we analysed caspase- 3 cleavage by immunohistology. In normal skin as well as non-lesional AD skin, we detected caspase- 3 cleavage in single cells of the basal layer. In contrast, in acute lesional AD skin, we not only obtained evidence for increased expression of cleaved caspase- 3 in keratinocytes of the basal layer but also observed caspase- 3 cleavage in one or more layers of the spinous cell layer, in particular in spongiotic areas. Short-term topical treatment of the skin lesions with tacrolimus or pimecrolimus abolished the expression of cleaved caspase- 3 in the <b>spinous</b> <b>layer.</b> Moreover, epidermal caspase- 3 cleavage correlated with the numbers of dermal interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) -expressing CD 4 + and CD 8 + lymphocytes in skin lesions of AD patients, supporting the view that IFN-gamma is important for the activation of proapoptotic pathways in keratinocytes. This is also confirmed by the observation of increased Fas expression on keratinocytes in acute AD lesions that was markedly reduced following topical calcineurin inhibitor treatment. These data suggest that caspase- 3 cleavage in the <b>spinous</b> <b>layer</b> of the epidermis is a pathologic event contributing to spongiosis formation in AD, whereas cleavage of caspase- 3 in basal cells might represent a physiologic mechanism within the process of epidermal renewal...|$|E

The immunoblot analysis using epidermal extract revealed the presence of circulating antibodies directed to 130 - and 160 -kDa antigens in the patient's serum. These two antigens were evidenced from nitrocellulose membrane with colorimetric AP systems, which highlighted the presence of autoantibodies against desmoglein (Dsg) 1 and Dsg 3 (sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). We also performed an enzyme-linked immunoassay. All these findings suggested that this patient's pemphigus had features of both vulgaris and foliaceus variants...|$|R
40|$|Tinea versicolor infections {{examined}} by electron microscopy {{were compared with}} the clinically normal (uninfected) skin of the same subjects. Comparison was made by detailed study of all layers of the epidermis with special emphasis on the basal and <b>spinous</b> <b>layers.</b> For the detailed studies photographic montages (at 12, 000 ×) were prepared from electron micrographs of sections of skin up to 0. 1 mm square. The results of these procedures provided {{a comparison of the}} reactions observed in the skin of the two patients reported here: a) extracellular deposits of glycogen in the normal and the infected skin, and b) cell damage and repair. From the evidence for the extracellular deposition of glycogen as a normal component of the skin of subjects with tinea versicolor and also as a product of reaction to infection, it is postulated that susceptibility to tinea versicolor infection is related to an abnormality of cutaneous glycogen metabolism. From the evidence of cell damage and repair it is concluded that tinea versicolor is more than the harmless overgrowth of the fungus Malassezia furfur (Syn. Pityrosporum sp.) {{on the surface of the}} skin...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} {{and distribution}} of the motor end-plates in the striated muscle and the terminal nerve fibers in the epithelium of {{the wall of the}} esophagus, which contain calcitonin gene-related peptide, were studied by light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. Varicose immunoreactive nerve fibers arising from the subepithelial plexus were seen to penetrate into the epithelium where they ended in terminal boutons. These nerve fibers lost their Schwann cells just at the point of penetration into the epithelium. Characteristically, the epithelial cells of the <b>spinous</b> <b>layer</b> showed prominent tonofilaments in the part of the cytoplasm in contact with the immunoreactive nerve varicosities, but membrane specializations between these structures were not observed. In the striated muscle of the esophageal wall there were small, elliptical, immunoreactive motor end-plates, which contained a small number of axonal clear vesicles and mitochondria. They were associated with relatively short and rarely branched junctional folds, reduced postjunctional surfaces and few organelles in the underlying sarcoplasm, features characteristic of the neuromuscular junctions of slow-fatiguing red muscle fibers. The two types of immunoreactive nerve endings, epithelial and muscular, presumably participate in afferent and efferent limbs respectively of the neural control of esophageal motility. The relationship between immunoreactive nerve terminals and epithelial cells in the <b>spinous</b> <b>layer</b> exhibiting prominent tonofilaments allowed us to speculate about the existence of two different patterns of reception to sensory stimuli. The intraepithelial fibers that end in the middle layer of the epithelium could be related to mechanoreceptor reflexes, while those that end in the upper layer may be related to thermoreceptor reflexes or facilitate information about the chemical and other characteristics of foods.

40|$|The {{epidermal}} keratinocyte {{cell line}} Pam 2 l 2 undergoes spontaneous apoptosis in culture, providing an in vitro {{model for the}} early steps of epidermal differentiation. Pam 2 l 2 cells exhibit charaderistics of basal keratinocytes, committed for {{the transition to the}} <b>spinous</b> <b>layer</b> of the epidermis. Bcl- 2 can regulate the differentiation of these cells by negatively regulating several genes that have been implicated in apoptosis. We show evidence that a serine protease adivity, secreted by the Pam 2 l 2 cells, could induce apoptosis in Pam 2 l 2 and several other cell lines. This adivity might be regulated via the bcl- 2 pathway. We suggest that this serine protease could either diredly, via binding and/or cleavage of a serine protease-adivated receptor, or indiredly, via the cleavage of an unknown protein...|$|E
40|$|Common wart is {{the most}} {{frequent}} clinical lesion caused by human papillomaviruses (HPVs). Giant, chronic, isolated, and solitary lesion is uncommon. We reported a case of giant verruca vulgaris in a 66 year-old man on left dorsal pedis that slowly enlarged and hardened in 10 years. It was a solitary hyperkeratotic verruca vulgaris, grey brownish in color, circumscribe, round, and 3 x 2. 4 x 0. 4 cm in size. Histopathologic examination revealed compact hyperkeratosis/orthokeratosis, many koilocytes in the granular and upper <b>spinous</b> <b>layer,</b> acanthosis, and elongated rete ridges that were pointing radially {{toward the center of}} the lesion. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization failed to identify HPV DNA. The patient was successfully treated with salicylic acid 40 % ointment.

40|$|We present {{molecular}} {{and protein}} profiling of all acetylcholine receptors (ACh-R) in human scalp skin using PCR, {{in situ hybridization}} and double-labeling immunofluorescence. Within the epidermis, the nicotinic (n) ACh-R subunits, α 3, α 5, β 2, and β 4 were expressed in the basal cell layer (BCL) and in a single cell layer in the stratum granulosum; α 9 was expressed in the basal and lower <b>spinous</b> <b>layers.</b> α 7, α 10, and β 1 were preferentially detected in the upper <b>spinous</b> and granular <b>layers.</b> Of the muscarinic (m) ACh-R, m 1 and m 4 {{were found in the}} suprabasal layers, whereas m 2, m 3, and m 5 remained restricted to the lower layers. In the outer root sheath of the hair follicle, all ACh-R except α 9, β 1, and m 4 were found in the BCL whereas the α 9, m 4, and m 5 ACh-R were restricted to the central cell layer. The α 5, β 1, β 2, m 1 –m 4 chains were strongly expressed in the inner root sheath. Undifferentiated sebocytes expressed the α 3, α 9, β 4, m 3 –m 5 ACh-R whereas α 7, β 2, β 4, m 2, and m 4 were found in mature sebocytes. In sweat glands, the α 3 *, α 7, and m 2 –m 5 ACh-R were most prominent in the myoepithelial cells whereas α 9, β 2, m 1, m 3, and m 4 ACh-R were present in the acinar cells. Taken together, our data result in a complete molecular map of the extraneuronal cholinergic system of the skin that may be translated into distinct functional reaction patterns...|$|R
40|$|Profilaggrin mRNA {{has been}} {{localized}} in newborn rat skin by in situ hybridization. The granular layer {{and the hair}} canals of the epidermis are strongly positive for profilaggrin mRNA, while the basal and <b>spinous</b> cell <b>layers</b> are negative. These results suggest that profilaggrin gene expression is under transcriptional regulation since profilaggrin protein detected by immunohistochemistry closely corresponds to the distribution of profilaggrin mRNA. In addition, our {{results suggest that the}} profilaggrin gene is not coordinately expressed with the genes specifying the differentiation-specific keratins...|$|R
40|$|Matriptase, a type 2 transmembrane serine protease, and its {{inhibitor}} hepatocyte {{growth factor}} activator inhibitor (HAI) - 1 {{are required for}} normal epidermal barrier function, and matriptase activity is tightly regulated during this process. We therefore hypothesized that this protease system might be deregulated in skin disease. To test this, we examined the level and activation state of matriptase in examples of 23 human skin disorders. We first examined matriptase and HAI- 1 protein distribution in normal epidermis. Matriptase was detected at high levels at cell-cell junctions in the basal <b>layer</b> and <b>spinous</b> <b>layers</b> but was present at minimal levels in the granular layer. HAI- 1 was distributed in a similar pattern, except that high-level expression was retained in the granular layer. This pattern of expression was retained in most skin disorders. We next examined the distribution of activated matriptase. Although activated matriptase is not detected in normal epidermis, a dramatic increase is seen in keratinocytes {{at the site of}} inflammation in 16 different skin diseases. To gain further evidence that activation is associated with inflammatory stimuli, we challenged HaCaT cells with acidic pH or H 2 O 2 and observed matriptase activation. These findings suggest that inflammation-associated reactive oxygen species and tissue acidity may enhance matriptase activation in some skin diseases...|$|R
