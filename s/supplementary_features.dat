5|$|Cumulus clouds come in four {{distinct}} species, cumulis humilis, mediocris, congestus, and fractus. These {{species may}} be arranged into the variety, cumulus radiatus; {{and may be}} accompanied by up to seven <b>supplementary</b> <b>features,</b> cumulus pileus, velum, virga, praecipitatio, arcus, pannus, and tuba.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus <b>supplementary</b> <b>features</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} {{seen with the}} species congestus. Cumulus virga clouds are cumulus clouds producing virga (precipitation that evaporates while aloft), and cumulus praecipitatio produce precipitation that reaches the Earth's surface. Cumulus pannus comprise shredded clouds that normally appear beneath the parent cumulus cloud during precipitation. Cumulus arcus clouds have a gust front, and cumulus tuba clouds have funnel clouds or tornadoes. Cumulus pileus clouds refer to cumulus clouds that have grown so rapidly as to force the formation of pileus {{over the top of}} the cloud. Cumulus velum clouds have an ice crystal veil over the growing top of the cloud.|$|E

25|$|One {{group of}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>features</b> are not actual cloud formations, but {{precipitation}} that falls when water droplets or ice crystals {{that make up}} visible clouds have grown too heavy to remain aloft. Virga is a feature seen with clouds producing precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground, these being of the genera cirrocumulus, altocumulus, altostratus, nimbostratus, stratocumulus, cumulus, and cumulonimbus.|$|E
25|$|The species fractus shows {{variable}} instability {{because it}} can be a subdivision of genus-types of different physical forms that have different stability characteristics. This subtype can be in the form of ragged but mostly stable stratiform sheets (stratus fractus) or small ragged cumuliform heaps with somewhat greater instability (cumulus fractus). When they form at low altitudes, stratiform and cumuliform genus-types can be torn up into shreds by brisk low level winds that create mechanical turbulence against the ground. Fractus clouds can form in precipitation at low altitudes, with or without brisk or gusty winds. They are closely associated with precipitating cloud systems of considerable vertical and sometimes horizontal extent, so they are also classified as accessory clouds under the name pannus (see section on <b>supplementary</b> <b>features).</b>|$|E
500|$|Released on November 28, 2007, the Xbox Live Arcade port of Asteroids has revamped HD {{graphics}} {{along with}} an added intense [...] "throttle monkey" [...] mode. Both Asteroids in its arcade and 2600 versions and Asteroids Deluxe were ported to Microsofts Game Room download service in 2010. Glu Mobile released a mobile phone port of the game with <b>supplementary</b> <b>features</b> {{as well as the}} original arcade version.|$|E
50|$|The <b>supplementary</b> {{instructions}} <b>feature</b> {{has always}} been assumed to mean fixed sets of instructions that are not obligatory across all CPUs in a CPU family. Supplementary instructions will simply not be found on all processors within that family. A programmer who wishes to use a <b>supplementary</b> <b>feature</b> of a CPU is faced {{with a couple of}} choices.|$|R
5000|$|Stratus clouds don't produce {{accessory}} clouds, but a <b>supplementary</b> <b>feature</b> praecipitatio {{is derived}} from Latin, which means [...] "precipitation". Stratus clouds are too low to produce virga, or rain shears that evaporate before reaching the ground.|$|R
25|$|Incus is {{the most}} type-specific <b>supplementary</b> <b>feature,</b> seen only with {{cumulonimbus}} of the species capillatus. A cumulonimbus incus cloud top {{is one that has}} spread out into a clear anvil shape as a result of rising air currents hitting the stability layer at the tropopause where the air no longer continues to get colder with increasing altitude.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Supplementary</b> <b>features</b> and {{accessory}} {{clouds are}} not further subdivisions of cloud types below the species and variety level. Rather, {{they are either}} hydrometeors or special cloud types with their own Latin names that form in association with certain cloud genera, species, and varieties. [...] <b>Supplementary</b> <b>features,</b> whether {{in the form of}} clouds or precipitation, are directly attached to the main genus-cloud. [...] Accessory clouds, by contrast, are generally detached from the main cloud.|$|E
2500|$|Lost {{footage of}} the missing Socorro Sequence where Tuco {{continues}} his search for Blondie in a Texican pueblo while Blondie is {{in a hotel room}} with a Mexican woman (Silvana Bacci) is reconstructed with photos and unfinished snippets from the French trailer. Also, in the documentary [...] "Reconstructing The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly", what looks to be footage of Tuco lighting cannons before the Ecstasy of Gold sequence appears briefly. None of these scenes or sequences appear in the 2004 re-release, however, but are in the <b>supplementary</b> <b>features.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment {{released}} The Muppets on Blu-ray Disc, DVD, {{and digital}} download on March 20, 2012, {{the same day}} the Muppets received a collective star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The release was produced in four different physical packages: a three-disc combo pack (Blu-ray, DVD, and digital copy) with soundtrack download ("The Wocka Wocka Value Pack); a two-disc combo pack (Blu-ray and DVD); a one-disc DVD with soundtrack download; and a one-disc DVD without soundtrack download. The film was released digitally in high definition and standard definition. The two-disc edition's <b>supplementary</b> <b>features</b> include bloopers, deleted and extended scenes, [...] "Muppet Intermission", [...] "Scratching the Surface: A Hasty Examination of the Making of Disney's The Muppets", the fully intact version of [...] "Let's Talk About Me", [...] "A Little Screen Test on the Way to the Read Through," [...] and an audio commentary with Jason Segel, James Bobin, and Nicholas Stoller. The three-disc combo pack also includes the theatrical spoof trailers (including exclusive, unreleased parody trailers of Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Fast Five) and a digital download of the soundtrack, while still including the same features as the two-disc combo pack.|$|E
500|$|Cirrus Floccus {{is derived}} from Latin, which means [...] "lock of wool" [...] or cirrus with ragged bases. They {{are not to be}} {{confused}} with cirrocumulus floccus since they are larger than cirrocumulus and mostly are isolated. A precipitation-based <b>supplementary</b> <b>feature</b> virga is mostly visible, which makes it easier to distinguish the difference between cirrocumulus floccus and cirrus floccus.|$|R
50|$|Accessory clouds: The pannus <b>supplementary</b> <b>feature</b> is {{sometimes}} seen with precipitating Cu mediocris, however the CL7 reporting code normally used with this feature is overridden by the CL2 code that identifies cumulus with significant vertical development. Pileus (cap cloud), velum (apron), arcus (roll or shelf cloud) and tuba (vertical column) features are also occasionally seen with cumulus mediocris.|$|R
50|$|Incus is {{the most}} type-specific <b>supplementary</b> <b>feature,</b> seen only with {{cumulonimbus}} of the species capillatus. A cumulonimbus incus cloud top {{is one that has}} spread out into a clear anvil shape as a result of rising air currents hitting the stability layer at the tropopause where the air no longer continues to get colder with increasing altitude.|$|R
2500|$|Several new <b>supplementary</b> <b>features</b> {{have been}} {{formally}} {{recognized by the}} World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The feature fluctus can form under conditions of strong atmospheric wind shear and instability when wave-like clouds of the variety undulatus break into regularly spaced crests. This variant is sometimes known informally as a Kelvinâ€“Helmholtz (wave) cloud. [...] This phenomenon has also been observed in cloud formations over other planets {{and even in the}} sun's atmosphere. [...] Another highly disturbed but more chaotic wave-like cloud feature associated with the undulatus variety has been given the Latin name asperitus. [...] The supplementary feature cavum is a circular fall-streak hole that occasionally forms in a thin layer of supercooled altocumulus or cirrocumulus. [...] Fall streaks consisting of virga or wisps of cirrus are usually seen beneath the hole as ice crystals fall out to a lower altitude. [...] This type of hole is usually larger than typical lacunosus holes. A murus feature is a cumulonimbus wall cloud with a lowering, rotating cloud base than can lead to the development of tornadoes. A cauda feature is a tail cloud that extends horizontally away from the murus cloud and is the result of air feeding into the storm.|$|E

5000|$|Asperitas (formerly {{known as}} Undulatus asperatus) is a cloud {{formation}} first popularized and proposed {{as a type}} of cloud in 2009 by Gavin Pretor-Pinney of the Cloud Appreciation Society. Added to the International Cloud Atlas as a <b>supplementary</b> <b>feature</b> in March of 2017, it is the first cloud formation added since cirrus intortus in 1951. [...] The name translates approximately as [...] "roughness".|$|R

500|$|The species Cumulus fractus is ragged in {{appearance}} and can form in clear air as {{a precursor to}} cumulus humilis and larger cumulus species-types; or it can form in precipitation as the <b>supplementary</b> <b>feature</b> pannus (also called scud) which can also include stratus fractus of bad weather. Cumulus humilis clouds look like puffy, flattened shapes. Cumulus mediocris clouds look similar, except that they have some vertical development. Cumulus congestus clouds have a cauliflower-like structure and tower high into the atmosphere, hence their alternate name [...] "towering cumulus". The variety Cumulus radiatus forms in radial bands called cloud streets and can comprise {{any of the four}} species of cumulus.|$|R
5000|$|Mammatus (mamma or mammatocumulus), meaning [...] "mammary cloud", is a {{cellular}} pattern of pouches hanging underneath {{the base of}} a cloud, typically cumulonimbus rainclouds, although they may be attached to other classes of parent clouds. The name mammatus is derived from the Latin [...] (meaning [...] "udder" [...] or [...] "breast"). According to the WMO International Cloud Atlas, mamma is a cloud <b>supplementary</b> <b>feature</b> rather than a genus, species or variety of cloud. They are formed by cold air sinking down to form the pockets contrary to the puffs of clouds rising through the convection of warm air. These formations were first described in 1894 by William Clement Ley.|$|R
