40|$|Forming {{processes}} usually involve irreversible plastic transformations. The calculation in {{that case}} becomes cumbersome when large parts and processes are considered. Recently Model Order Reduction techniques opened new perspectives for an accurate and fast simulation of mechanical systems, however nonlinear history-dependent behaviors remain still today challenging scenarios {{for the application of}} these techniques. In this work we are proposing a quite <b>simple</b> non <b>intrusive</b> strategy able to address such behaviors by coupling a separated representation with a POD-based reduced basis within an incremental elastoplastic formulation...|$|R

The result was lower distortion and a more cohesive, immersive and better-distributed sound - which integrated particularly well when used as a 5.1 system with the dedicated AV products from the range.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This work {{discusses}} {{a simple}} means to add kinematic constraints to existing mechani-cal problems formulated {{in terms of}} ordinary differential equations. The constraints are expressed by algebraic relationships between the co-ordinates of the unconstrained problem. A solu-tion projection approach ensures compliance of the solution with the derivatives of holonomic constraint equations up to second order within the desired accuracy. The structure of the uncon-strained problem is not altered, resulting in a <b>simple,</b> little <b>intrusive,</b> yet effective means to enforce kinematic constraints into existing formulations and implementations originally intended to address differential problems, without the complexity of solving differential-algebraic problems or resorting to implicit numerical integration schemes and without altering the number and type of equations of the original unconstrained problem. The proposed formulation is compared with known approaches. Numerical applications of increasing complexity illustrate its distinguishing aspects...|$|R

40|$|In 2003 : the {{government}} will introduce new tax credits to provide financial support for children and low-paid workers: the integrated child credit and the employment tax credit. The reform to support for children aims to unify existing payments {{in a way that}} provides a guaranteed stream of income for those with children, whether they are working or not. The credit for people in work will provide an income top-up for low earners - something that those without children have not benefited from before. The government has not announced the impact of the reforms on the public finances, but both will cost the exchequer money, so this Commentary considers the likely sums involved. We also examine whether the reforms look like fulfilling their stated aims: making work pay, relieving poverty and creating a new type of state support that is <b>simpler</b> and less <b>intrusive</b> for claimants. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract + The {{infusion}} of mobile computing elements (e. g. data mules, mobile actuators/sinks and etc.) into Wireless Sensor Networks undoubtedly requires {{the knowledge of}} various wireless network properties to fasten their interactivity. Moreover, since the rate of a wireless link can vary dynamically and rapidly due to changes in interference, distance, or energy optimization policy, timely knowledge of the end-to-end path capacity in WSN can be of great assistance to more efficient routing and traffic management. Particularly, information on end-to-end path capacity {{can be used to}} assess the applicability of a given WSN deployment, and determine whether the deployment meets the requirements of its intended applications. In this paper, we propose SenProbe, an end-to-end path capacity estimation tool inspired by CapProbe concepts, yet specifically designed to work in the popular CSMA-CA based WSNs. With simulations and analysis, we evaluated the behavior and effectiveness of SenProbe, and showed that it is a <b>simple</b> and less <b>intrusive</b> technique that yields accurate results. 1...|$|R
40|$|Extract] To the editor: Colbert and Schoeller (2) {{highlight}} {{an interesting}} point of view concerning the potential shift in physical activity (PA) monitoring. While the use of objective measures is highly encouraged, one must still recognize the limitations of such devices (3, 4) and importantly that we don't currently possess or utilize the perfect PA assessment tool. As indicated by Colbert and Schoeller (2), many studies have reported various correlations between questionnaire responses and objective monitors indicating similarities in PA assessment though the specific attributes of PA being assessed may be quite diverse. Very recently, the uniqueness of questionnaire assessment was reported in a large population study with self-reported PA suggested to identify PA aspects not concurrently assessed by accelerometers (1). Therefore, the notion that objective PA tools are more valid or accurate than nonobjective tools such as questionnaires should be considered with caution as these tools may in fact assess different aspects of PA. While the cost and size of objective monitors has been dramatically reduced recently, {{the use of such}} monitors still remains challenging for assessment of different activity modes and intensities, and for all populations, despite all good intentions. Hence, the use of <b>simple,</b> less <b>intrusive</b> tools like questionnaires will always be of relevance until the elusive, flawless PA assessment tool(s) has/have been developed. Of most importance are the identification of current PA assessment tool limitations and the development of BETTER PA assessment methodologies that exhibit high validity and applicability to a range of populations for a greater understanding of the interplay between PA and health...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} digital image {{processing}} techniques have become a very popular way of determining strains and full-field displacements {{in the field of}} experimental mechanics due to advancements in image processing techniques and also because the actual process of measurement is <b>simpler</b> and not <b>intrusive</b> compared to traditional sensor based techniques. This paper presents a filtering technique which processes the polar components of the image displacement fields. First, pyramidal gradient-based optical flow is calculated between blocks of each two frames of a speckle image sequence while trying to compensate in the calculation small rotations and shears of the image blocks. The polar components of the resulting motion vectors - phase and amplitude - are then extracted. Each of the motion vector angle values is smoothed temporally using a Kalman filter that takes into account previously calculated angles located at the same spatial position in the motion fields. A subsequent adaptive spatial filter is used to process both the temporally smoothed angles and amplitudes of the motion field. Finally, test results of the proposed method being applied to a speckle image sequence that illustrates plastic materials being subjected to uniaxial stress and to artificial data sets are presented...|$|R
40|$|PhDIn todayâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s working {{world the}} elderly who are {{dependent}} {{can sometimes be}} neglected by society. Statistically, after toddlers it is the elderly who are observed to have higher accident rates while performing everyday activities. Alzheimerâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s disease {{is one of the}} major impairments that elderly people suffer from, and leads to the elderly person not being able to live an independent life due to forgetfulness. One way to support elderly people who aspire to live an independent life and remain safe in their home is to find out what activities the elderly person is carrying out at a given time and provide appropriate assistance or institute safeguards. The aim of this research is to create improved methods to identify tasks related to activities of daily life and determine a personâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s current intentions and so reason about that personâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s future intentions. A novel hierarchal framework has been developed, which recognises sensor events and maps them to significant activities and intentions. As privacy is becoming a growing concern, the monitoring of an individualâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s behaviour can be seen as intrusive. Hence, the monitoring is based around using <b>simple</b> non <b>intrusive</b> sensors and tags on everyday objects that are used to perform daily activities around the home. Specifically there is no use of any cameras or visual surveillance equipment, though the techniques developed are still relevant in such a situation. Models for task recognition and plan recognition have been developed and tested on scenarios where the plans can be interwoven. Potential targets are people in the first stages of Alzheimerâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s disease and in the structuring of the library of kernel plan sequences, typical routines used to sustain meaningful activity have been used. Evaluations have been carried out using volunteers conducting activities of daily life in an experimental home environment. The results generated from the sensors have been interpreted and analysis of developed algorithms has been made. The outcomes and findings of these experiments demonstrate that the developed hierarchal framework is capable of carrying activity recognition as well as being able to carry out intention analysis, e. g. predicting what activity they are most likely to carry out next...|$|R
40|$|Infants {{with single}} {{ventricle}} physiology generally undergo three palliative surgeries starting with stage-one, {{in which a}} systemic-to-pulmonary connection is established via a shunt. Mortality is the highest among stage-one patients (up to 23 %) due to sub-optimal oxygen delivery, ventricle volume overload, myocardial ischemia, and high risk of shunt blockage. The clinical objective {{of the present study}} is to simulate the stage-one circulation, analyze possible surgical options, optimize current surgical methods, and explore a novel alternative surgical option. Simulating the stage-one circulation in single ventricle repair requires a set of numerical tools that are developed {{in the first part of}} this dissertation. First, an implicit and modular multidomain framework with excellent stability and convergence properties is introduced that allows multiscale simulation of the circulatory system. Second, a stabilized formulation is presented for treating backflow at Neumann boundaries that is inexpensive, stable, <b>simple,</b> and minimally <b>intrusive,</b> and offers a promising alternative to previous methods. Third, an efficient pre-conditioner for coupled boundary conditions and an efficient iterative algorithm for solving system of equations governing incompressible flows are introduced. Fourth, a scalable parallel data structure is introduced for performing algebraic operations in iterative solvers efficiently. Fifth, an Eulerian formulation is proposed for calculating residence time that lacks mesh dependency and avoids the high computational cost of Lagrangian particle-based approaches. These tools are applicable to other cardiac mechanics and CFD simulations as well. In second part of this dissertation, single ventricle physiology is studied using the tools presented in the first part. First, a multiscale model of single ventricle physiology is simulated and the shunt geometry is optimized to maximize oxygen delivery and improve performance. Second, surgical scenarios single and multiple systemic-to-pulmonary connections are compared, revealing higher thrombotic risk and lower oxygen delivery in the presence of multiple connections. Third, a novel stage one palliative surgery, which provides an alternative source of blood flow in case of shunt blockage and may ultimately reduce the number of open chest surgeries from three to two, is proposed and tested using multiscale modeling. Results reveal the proposed surgical method, the Assisted Bidirectional Glenn, can deliver more oxygen at a reduced heart load with only a modest increase in venous return pressur...|$|R
40|$|Otitis Media with Effusion (OME), {{commonly}} referred to as glue ear, {{is one of the most}} common illnesses of early childhood. It is difficult to detect as OME is frequently symptom free and usually clears spontaneously. It can be detected by tympanometry, a <b>simple</b> painless non <b>intrusive</b> test, which can be easily performed by trained operators. In New Zealand all children have this hearing test on school entry. Research has shown links between OME and educational under achievement, possibly due to the intermittent deafness which accompanies this condition. As OME mostly occurs during early childhood, a time when the basis of language is being established, it may cause delays in learning which will not be seen until later in life. This research was designed to examine the possible effect of OME on emerging literacy in 120 children from a large urban area of New Zealand. The aural history of the children was established from a questionnaire and the results of the hearing tests on school entry. Measures of their reading ability were obtained from their scores on the Diagnostic Reading Survey. This survey, usually referred to as the six year old net test, is taken by most children in New Zealand. The childrens' scores on the reading test were examined to see if there was any correlation between these and evidence of OME. Although no conclusive proof was found that children with OME were reading at a lower age than their peers, statistically significant differences were found between the scores of the Dictation section of the test. The Dictation section is designed to measure how well children are distinguishing and recording individual sounds in words. The findings suggest that OME affects auditory discrimination so that incorrect symbols are ascribed to sounds. This effect will hinder a child when learning to read and may cause delays in other aspects of learning. No evidence of increased incidence of OME amongst Maori or Pacific Island students was found, however, the number of these students in the sample was very small. Maori and Pacific Island students however did have significantly lower scores than their peers in all aspects of the reading test...|$|R
