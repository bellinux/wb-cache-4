5|$|Whitaker's 2006 {{portrayal}} of Idi Amin in the film, The Last King of Scotland earned him positive reviews by critics {{as well as}} multiple awards and honors. To portray the dictator, Whitaker gained 50 pounds, learned to play the accordion, and immersed himself in research. He read books about Amin, watched news and documentary footage featuring Amin, and spent time in Uganda meeting with Amin's friends, relatives, generals, and victims; he also learned Swahili and mastered Amin's East African accent. His performance earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor, making him the fourth African-American actor in history to do so, joining the ranks of <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier,</b> Denzel Washington, and Jamie Foxx. For that same role, he was also recognized with the British Academy Film Award, Golden Globe Award, National Board of Review Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and accolades from the Broadcast Film Critics Association, London Film Critics’ Circle Award, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, National Society of Film Critics, and New York Film Critics Circle among others.|$|E

25|$|The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier</b> and Dorothy Dandridge were {{nominated}} in the musical/comedy performance category but lost to Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe, both for Some Like It Hot.|$|E
25|$|Along with Paul Newman, <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier</b> {{and later}} Steve McQueen, Streisand formed First Artists Production Company in 1969 so actors could secure {{properties}} and develop movie projects for themselves. Streisand's initial outing with First Artists was Up the Sandbox (1972).|$|E
25|$|As an actor, he made All the Young Men with <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier</b> {{that was}} {{released}} through Columbia. One Foot in Hell (1960) over at 20th Century Fox saw Ladd play an out-and-out villain {{for the first}} time since the beginning of his career, but the result was not popular with audiences.|$|E
25|$|Parker's theater career {{continued}} {{when she}} appeared in Paula Vogel's 1997 critical smash How I Learned to Drive, with David Morse. In the late 1990s, {{she appeared in}} several independent films, including Let the Devil Wear Black and The Five Senses. She starred alongside <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier</b> in the 1999 movie The Simple Life of Noah Dearborn.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, Brando {{performed}} in Ben Hecht's Zionist play A Flag is Born. He attended some fundraisers for John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election. In August 1963, {{he participated in}} the March on Washington along with fellow celebrities Harry Belafonte, James Garner, Charlton Heston, Burt Lancaster and <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier.</b> Along with Paul Newman, Brando also participated in the freedom rides.|$|E
25|$|Widmark then co-starred with Gene Tierney and Googie Withers in Jules Dassin's Night and the City {{and with}} Paul Douglas, Barbara Bel Geddes, Jack Palance and Zero Mostel in Elia Kazan's Panic in the Streets (both 1950). They are {{considered}} classic examples of film noir. Around the same time, Widmark starred with <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier</b> in the gripping racial melodrama No Way Out (also 1950).|$|E
25|$|Smaller roles (some {{only a few}} seconds) {{were played}} by Michael Ansara, Ina Balin, Carroll Baker, Robert Blake, Pat Boone, Victor Buono, John Considine, Richard Conte, John Crawford, Jamie Farr, David Hedison, Van Heflin, Russell Johnson, Angela Lansbury, Mark Lenard, Robert Loggia, John Lupton, Janet Margolin, Sal Mineo, Nehemiah Persoff, <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier,</b> Gary Raymond, Marian Seldes, David Sheiner, Abraham Sofaer, Paul Stewart, John Wayne, Shelley Winters, and Peter Mann.|$|E
25|$|Another star-producer was {{interested}} in Curtis supporting him - Kirk Douglas for The Vikings (1958). Janet Leigh also starred and the resulting movie was a massive hit. Curtis then co-starred with Frank Sinatra and Natalie Wood in Kings Go Forth (1958), a war story. It was mildly popular but The Defiant Ones (1958), was a big success. Curtis gave an Oscar-nominated performance as a bigoted white escaped convict chained to a black man, <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{the height}} of the Hollywood blacklist, Lee managed to find work in 1950 as the star of a British film Cry, The Beloved Country, for which both he and <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier</b> were smuggled into South Africa as indentured {{servants}} in order to play their roles as African ministers. During filming, Lee had his first heart attack, and he never fully recovered his health. The film’s message of universal brotherhood stands as Lee's final work towards this aim.|$|E
25|$|The {{play was}} {{inspired}} by the real-life story of David Hampton, a con man and robber who managed to convince a {{number of people in the}} 1980s that he was the son of actor <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier.</b> The writer John Guare was a friend of Inger McCabe Elliott and her husband Osborn Elliott. In October 1983 Hampton came to the Elliott's New York apartment and they allowed him to spend the night. The next morning Inger Elliott found Hampton in bed with another man and later called the police. The Elliotts told Guare about the story and it inspired him to write the play years later.|$|E
25|$|Super Fly brought {{success that}} {{resulted}} in Mayfield being tapped for additional soundtracks, some of which he wrote and produced while having others perform the vocals. Gladys Knight & the Pips recorded Mayfield's soundtrack for Claudine in 1974, while Aretha Franklin recorded the soundtrack for Sparkle in 1976. Mayfield also worked with The Staples Singers on the soundtrack for the 1975 film Let's Do It Again, and teamed up with Mavis Staples exclusively on the 1977 film soundtrack A Piece of the Action (both movies {{were part of a}} trilogy of films that featured the acting and comedic exploits of Bill Cosby and <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier</b> and were directed by Poitier).|$|E
25|$|Gershwin's all-black opera {{was also}} unpopular with some celebrated black artists. Harry Belafonte {{declined}} to play Porgy {{in the late}} 1950s film version, so the role went to <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier.</b> Betty Allen, president of The Harlem School of the Arts, admittedly loathed the piece, and Grace Bumbry, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: I thought it beneath me, I felt I had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My {{way of dealing with}} it was to see that it was really a piece of Americana, of American history, whether we liked it or not. Whether I sing it or not, it was still going to be there.|$|E
25|$|Belafonte {{was born}} Harold George Bellanfanti Jr. at Lying-in Hospital on March 1, 1927, in Harlem, New York, {{the son of}} Melvine (née Love), a {{housekeeper}} of Jamaican descent, and Harold George Bellanfanti Sr., a Martiniquan {{who worked as a}} chef. His mother was born in Jamaica, the child of a Scottish white mother and a black father. His father also was born in Jamaica, the child of a black mother and Dutch Jewish father of Sephardi origins. Belafonte has described his grandfather, whom he never met, as “a white Dutch Jew who drifted over to the islands after chasing gold and diamonds, with no luck at all”. From 1932 to 1940, he lived with one of his grandmothers in her native country of Jamaica. When he returned to New York City, he attended George Washington High School after which he joined the Navy and served during World War II. In the 1940s, he was working as a janitor's assistant in NYC when a tenant gave him, as a gratuity, two tickets to see the American Negro Theater. He {{fell in love with the}} art form and also met <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier.</b> The financially struggling pair regularly purchased a single seat to local plays, trading places in between acts, after informing the other about the progression of the play. At the end of the 1940s, he took classes in acting at the Dramatic Workshop of The New School in New York with the influential German director Erwin Piscator alongside Marlon Brando, Tony Curtis, Walter Matthau, Bea Arthur, and <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier,</b> while performing with the American Negro Theatre. He subsequently received a Tony Award for his participation in the Broadway revue John Murray Anderson's Almanac.|$|E
25|$|Dee {{joined the}} American Negro Theater as an apprentice, working with <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier,</b> Harry Belafonte, and Hilda Simms. She made several {{appearances}} on Broadway. Her first onscreen role was in That Man of Mine in 1946. She received national recognition {{for her role}} in the 1950 film The Jackie Robinson Story. In 1965, Dee performed in lead roles at the American Shakespeare Festival as Kate in The Taming of the Shrew and Cordelia in King Lear, becoming the first black actress to portray a lead role in the festival. Her career in acting crossed all major forms of media over a span of eight decades, including the films A Raisin in the Sun, in which she recreated her stage role as a suffering housewife in the projects, and Edge of the City. She played both roles opposite Poitier.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone along with writer Philip Stark, and was {{directed}} by Parker. [...] "Mecha-Streisand" [...] parodies numerous popular Kaiju films and features portrayals of actor <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier</b> and film critic Leonard Maltin.|$|E
500|$|In 1980 Wilder {{teamed up}} again with Richard Pryor in Stir Crazy, {{directed}} by <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier.</b> [...] Pryor {{was struggling with}} a severe cocaine addiction, and filming became difficult, but once the film premiered, it became an international success. New York magazine listed [...] "Skip Donahue" [...] (Wilder) and [...] "Harry Monroe" [...] (Pryor) as number nine on their 2007 list of [...] "The Fifteen Most Dynamic Duos in Pop Culture History", and the film has often appeared in [...] "best comedy" [...] lists and rankings.|$|E
500|$|Wilson and Gordon {{established}} the Du Bois Memorial Foundation to take {{ownership of the}} property. [...] Funded in part by high-profile donors including Ruby Dee, Ossie Davis, <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier,</b> and Norman Rockwell, the foundation received the property in September 1969 and dedicated it to Du Bois later that year. Local hostility continued; the Berkshire Courier, while counseling against violence, suggested the site be vandalized. [...] The town briefly threatened to prevent the dedication ceremony, suggesting there was a {{question as to whether}} the intended use of the site met local zoning regulations.|$|E
500|$|Guess Who's Coming to Dinner {{explored}} {{the topic of}} interracial marriage, with Tracy playing a liberal-minded newspaper publisher whose values are challenged when his daughter wishes to marry a black man, played by <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier.</b> [...] Tracy was happy to be working again, but he told the press the movie would be his last. To commence filming, Tracy had to be insured for the high premium of $71,000; Hepburn and Kramer both put their salaries in escrow until Tracy completed his scenes. In poor health, Tracy could only work {{for two or three}} hours each day. He completed his last scene on May 24, 1967. Tracy died 17 days later from a heart attack on June 10.|$|E
500|$|After {{a lengthy}} {{development}} process, during which Brad Pitt's production company Plan B Entertainment backed the project, which eventually helped get some financing from various film studios, {{the film was}} officially announced in August 2011 with McQueen to direct and Chiwetel Ejiofor to star as Solomon Northup, a free African-American who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the Deep South. McQueen compared Ejiofor's conduct [...] "of class and dignity" [...] to that of <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier</b> and Harry Belafonte. In October 2011, Michael Fassbender (who starred in McQueen's previous films Hunger and Shame) joined the cast. In early 2012, {{the rest of the}} roles were cast, and filming was scheduled to begin at the end of June 2012.|$|E
500|$|News {{footage of}} then-President Bill Clinton was {{digitally}} altered {{to make it}} appear as if he is speaking about alien contact. This was not the original plan for the film; Zemeckis had initially approached <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier</b> to play the president, but the actor turned the role down in favor of The Jackal. Shortly after Poitier's refusal, Zemeckis saw a NASA announcement in August 1996. [...] "Clinton gave his Mars rock speech," [...] the director explained, [...] "and I swear to God it was like it was scripted for this movie. When he said the line 'We will continue to listen closely to what it has to say,' I almost died. I stood there with my mouth hanging open." ...|$|E
500|$|Rodney Stephen [...] "Rod" [...] Steiger (April 14, 1925July 9, 2002) was an American actor, {{noted for}} his {{portrayal}} of offbeat, often volatile and crazed characters. Cited as [...] "one of Hollywood's most charismatic and dynamic stars", he is {{closely associated with the}} art of method acting, embodying the characters he played, which at times led to clashes with directors and co-stars. He starred as Marlon Brando's mobster brother Charlie in On the Waterfront (1954), the title character Sol Nazerman in The Pawnbroker (1964), and as police chief Bill Gillespie opposite <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier</b> in the film In the Heat of the Night (1967). His performance in that film won him the Academy Award for Best Actor.|$|E
500|$|Other {{media outlets}} {{received}} the broadcast more positively. Orange County Register film critic Henry Sheehan praised Goldberg's performance as hosting writing that her [...] "ensuing entrance a la Moulin Rouge was a comparative triumph and her boom-boom-boom succession of jokes put the show right on track." [...] Television columnist Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post raved, [...] "The nearly five-hour telecast was stunning, historic, slick, efficient, and helped along by some knockout clothes." [...] She also commented that Washington and Berry's acceptance speeches and the <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier</b> tribute {{added to the}} historic and emotional mood of the festivities. John Levesque of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer commended producer Ziskin for producing [...] "the best Oscar telecast this TV watcher can remember." [...] In addition, he wrote that [...] "It was clear the 74th Academy Awards ceremony was something special: fresh, crisp, different from its predecessors." ...|$|E
500|$|Streisand {{takes them}} to her condo in the mountains, where she ties the boys up and tortures them with her singing voice. Cartman relents and gives up the {{triangle}}. Streisand uses the triangle to complete the diamond, transforming herself into a giant mechanical dinosaur version of herself, Mecha-Streisand, and begins to lay waste to South Park with her new form. Maltin and Chef arrive to free the boys, and Maltin asks Chef to call Robert Smith of The Cure [...] for help. Maltin then transforms into a giant robot to battle Mecha-Streisand, but is quickly defeated. The boys evade fiery debris from the fight, but Kenny is killed when he stops to play tetherball and gets strangled by the rope. Actor <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier</b> arrives and turns into a giant fanged turtle to fight Mecha-Striesand, but he too is easily defeated. After getting {{a call from the}} boys and Chef, Robert Smith arrives and transforms into a giant moth creature.|$|E
500|$|... "Mecha-Streisand" [...] parodies Kaiju {{films such}} as Godzilla, Gamera, Mothra, and Ultraman. Parker and Stone watched many [...] Godzilla films during their childhoods, and Parker said he knew from the {{beginning}} of South Park that he would base an episode around the films. Streisand is based on Mechagodzilla, the mechanical doppelgänger of Godzilla. Smith is based on Mothra, the giant moth-like monster from the 1961 film Mothra and also one of Godzilla's rivals, which Parker described as his favorite of the Kaiju films. The scene in which six-inch-tall twins appear and ask actor <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier</b> to fight Mecha-Streisand are based on similar scenes and characters from the Mothra film. Poitier portrays a monster similar to Gamera, a flying turtle monster, and film critic Leonard Maltin transforms into a giant mechanical superhero resembling that of Japanese television superhero Ultraman. During the fights sequence, Stan shouts for Smith to [...] "use robot punch", a line frequently used in Ultraman television shows. The Diamond of Pantheos, on the other hand, closely resembles the pendant worn by a major character in the anime Galaxy Express 999.|$|E
500|$|Corbucci hired {{established}} German actor Klaus Kinski to play Loco, {{a character}} who was partially intended to emulate Gorca, the vampire played by Boris Karloff in Mario Bava's Black Sabbath, which served as a major stylistic influence on The Great Silence. Other cast members were established character actors in or outside the Spaghetti Western genre, including Luigi Pistilli, Mario Brega, Marisa Merlini, Raf Baldassare, Carlo D'Angelo, Spartaco Conversi and Bruno Corazzari (an actor often compared to Kinski). Frank Wolff, usually known for playing serious or villanous characters, was cast against type in the semi-comical role of Sheriff Burnett. [...] Vonetta McGee, a then-unknown pre-law San Francisco State College dropout and amateur actress who had moved to Rome to find work at Cinecittà, was cast as Pauline in her first film role. After appearing in Corbucci's film and Luigi Magni's Faustina, McGee was invited to return to America by <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier,</b> where she became a major actress in the blaxploitation genre. Alex Cox later cast her as Marlene in his film Repo Man based on her performance as Pauline.|$|E
500|$|In 1964, Makeba {{released}} her second studio album for RCA, The World of Miriam Makeba. An early example of world music, the album peaked at number eighty-six on the Billboard 200. Makeba's music had a cross-racial appeal in the US; white Americans {{were attracted to}} her image as an [...] "exotic" [...] African performer, and black Americans related their own experiences of racial segregation to Makeba's struggle against apartheid. Makeba found company among other African exiles and émigrés in New York, including Hugh Masekela, to whom she was married from 1963 to 1968. During their marriage, Makeba and Masekela were neighbours of the jazz musician Dizzy Gillespie in Englewood, New Jersey; they spent {{much of their time}} in Harlem. She also came to know actors Marlon Brando and Lauren Bacall, and musicians Louis Armstrong and Ray Charles. Fellow singer-activist Nina Simone became friendly with Makeba, as did actor Cicely Tyson; Makeba and Simone performed together at Carnegie Hall. Makeba was among black entertainers, activists, and intellectuals in New York at the time who believed that {{the civil rights movement and}} popular culture could reinforce each other, creating [...] "a sense of intertwined political and cultural vibrancy"; other examples included Maya Angelou and <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier.</b> She later described her difficulty living with racial segregation, saying [...] "There wasn't much difference in America; it was a country that had abolished slavery but there was apartheid in its own way." ...|$|E
500|$|Steiger had {{intended}} {{returning to the}} stage, and had signed on to play the title character in Bertolt Brecht's Galileo, at the Lincoln Center Repertory Company in April 1967, but the production was cancelled when he became ill. Steiger won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Chief of Police Bill Gillespie in In the Heat of the Night, opposite <b>Sidney</b> <b>Poitier.</b> He played a Southern police chief searching for a murderer. Prejudiced against blacks, he jumps {{to the conclusion that}} the culprit is Virgil Tibbs (Poitier), an African-American man passing through town after visiting his mother, who later turns out to be an experienced homicide detective from Philadelphia. The film deals with the way the two men interact and join forces in solving the crime, as Steiger's Gillespie learns to greatly respect the black man he initially took to be a criminal. Steiger drew upon his experience in the Navy with a Southerner named [...] "King", remembering his accent. Poitier considered Steiger and Spencer Tracy to have been the finest actors he had ever worked with, remarking in 1995, [...] "He's so good he made me dig into bags I never knew I had." [...] A. D. Murphy of Variety described Steiger's performance as [...] "outstanding", writing: [...] "Steiger's transformation from a diehard Dixie bigot to a man who learns to respect Poitier stands out in smooth comparison to the wandering solution of the murder." [...] Steiger won a plethora of other awards, including a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, a Laurel Award and awards for Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics and the New York Film Critics Circle.|$|E
