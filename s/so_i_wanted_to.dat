5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, {{and spent}} a lot of time in Eastern Europe. There is this amazing German house-techno music, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make a pop {{experimental}} record. I kind of wanted to leave the '80s a little bit, so the chorus is a '90s melody, which is what the inspiration was. There was certainly some whisky involved in the writing of the record. It's about being in love with your best friend.|$|E

500|$|For the episode's {{time travel}} elements, sound effects editor Bruce Tanis {{explained}} his choices of sound {{during an interview}} with Designing Sound: [...] "I used vocals from the dialog to create high-pitched jittery tones that played against the visual of his time-jumping. He would start to flicker faster and faster as he ramped up to the moment of leaping <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> play up the fragmented sense of time we had visually and create {{the idea that he}} was somehow jumping over other people to land at a different point in time. It also had electrical humming and zapping to support the electrical nature of the device".|$|E
500|$|... "Poker Face" [...] {{was written}} by Gaga and RedOne, while {{production}} was handled also by RedOne. Gaga stated {{in an interview that}} [...] "Poker Face" [...] {{was written by}} her as a pop song and was a tribute to her [...] "rock 'n' roll boyfriends". She also stated that the main idea behind the song was sex and gambling. In an interview with UK's Daily Star, Gaga noted of the song, [...] "It's about a lot of different things. I gamble but I've also dated a lot of guys who are really into sex and booze and gambling, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> write a record my boyfriends would like too." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, when asked about the meaning of the line [...] "bluffin' with my muffin", Gaga explained that it really was a metaphor for her vulva.|$|E
500|$|Feminist author Naomi Wolf {{criticized the}} video as {{propaganda}} for the Marine Corps, stating [...] "I {{really want to}} find out if she was paid by them for making it ..... it is truly shameful. I would suggest a boycott of this singer whom I really liked if you are as offended at this glorification of violence as I am." [...] Glenn Selig, founder of The Publicity Agency, responded to these claims on Fox News Live, stating, [...] "In her efforts to boycott the video, Naomi Wolf has brought more attention to it, without her comments, most people would clearly have seen the military simply as a metaphor and not as an attempt by Katy Perry to glamorize the military or war." [...] Perry told MTV that she chose the military plot because it represented the song, saying, [...] "It's an affirmation of strength, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go the strongest route I ever could." ...|$|E

500|$|Cornell {{stated that}} the biggest two {{influences}} on [...] "You Know My Name" [...] were Tom Jones, who performed the theme for Thunderball, and Paul McCartney, who composed and performed the theme for Live and Let Die. [...] "I decided that I was going to sing it like Tom Jones, in that crooning style. I wanted people to hear my voice," [...] Cornell said. [...] "And 'Live and Let Die' is a fantastic song. Paul McCartney wouldn't have written it if not for that movie. I [...] {{wanted to write a}} song in its own universe. I knew I'd never have it again — a big orchestra — <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> have fun with it." [...] Cornell did not put the film's title in the lyrics, because he [...] "couldn't imagine it fitting into a song lyric that would come out of my mouth". And he jokingly stated [...] "Casino Royale didn't make a good rock title, but I would write a song named Octopussy just for fun".|$|E
500|$|Jepsen's second studio {{album was}} {{initially}} {{planned to be}} released on February 14, 2012; however, she chose not to release it {{because she wanted to}} make sure she [...] "got the second CD right. I think I got a little nervous about the idea of the sophomore being a little less-than because it's so rushed. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> give myself the time to not feel that pressure." [...] She then worked with songwriter Josh Ramsay and producer Ryan Stewart on most of the album's tracks. Jepsen's songwriting process was inspired by her life and friends. After the recording sessions were completed, Curiosity was announced as a full-length album, with a digital release date confirmed for February 14, 2012. A few days before its official release, however, the label decided to change the format of the album, turning it into an extended play. The songs cut from the album [...] "Lost and Found", [...] "Alice In Wonderland", [...] "Dear Julian", [...] "Europe" [...] and [...] "Angels" [...] came to have their preview on iTunes Canada, before having changed album to EP.|$|E
500|$|... "Pour Me", {{the last}} soft {{song on the}} album, is a dark ballad that has been often {{compared}} to Eminem's [...] "Stan". Johnny3Tears stated that, [...] "We were messing around with chord progressions and that came out like a more major chord style than we were used to it. It's melodic and poppy sounding. We're talking about drinking obviously because all of us sometimes drink too much. It's one of those basic every day things that people go through but they don't know how to voice it or others around them don't know to voice it. It's almost like you're looked down upon, but no one actually talks about it." [...] "Tendencies", which is the closing track for the standard edition of the album, is a high tempo alternative metal song about murder. Johnny3Tears said, [...] "When we wrote Tendencies, I {{wanted to make a}} song that kids would just go nuts to when we played it. Kids start moshpits at our shows. Not every song we have is the best mosh song, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make a song kids could go crazy for." ...|$|E

500|$|Brown {{said the}} song was {{given to him by}} DJ Frank E {{while he was in the}} studio writing songs for other artists and himself. [...] "I heard the track and I was like man this is incredible. It kind of gave me the 'Forever' feeling <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do more of a song for my pop {{audience}}. I’ve been doing a lot of mix-tape stuff, a lot of urban records...the pop audience didn’t really have anything to gauge from so I really wanted to give them this and I feel like 'Yeah 3x' is something different, something new and it’s just [...] positive record. It’s not anything too over the top; it’s just right where it needs to be." [...] During a chat with fans on Ustream.tv on September 27, 2010, Brown said that {{the song was}} written in 15minutes; [...] "We actually got the beat and we did it in no time. It was effortless. It was fun. It was sort of like when we wrote 'Forever', so I hope you guys like that record. It's more of a pop record, in the club record." ...|$|E
500|$|The second {{music video}} for [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] was also {{directed}} by Motellet Film. It was filmed at a Swedish {{club in the}} span of three days, where the singer spent time with three friends who were asked to [...] "have a few drinks and make out" [...] with her. Consequently, the directors filmed a large amount of natural footage because there was not a specific [...] "direction". Regarding the fact that two of her friends were women, Lo expressed: [...] "There are girls in there—one of them is my best friend. That should be OK, that shouldn't even be a thing." [...] In the video, the singer wanted to [...] "show this kind of night where things can get out of control" [...] and the viewers to [...] "go slowly into this emotional turmoil" [...] represented in the lyrics of the song. She explained: [...] "I want people to know what I'm feeling. I want it to really reflect the song. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make a video that I'm not able to watch, which is kind of what it is." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the shock}} {{exit from the}} Confederations Cup with Spain, Villa {{returned}} from his holidays on 27 July amidst much media speculation linking him with top clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United. Villa quelled such rumours after announcing his desire to remain at the Mestalla to fulfil his contract, underlining that he [...] "could not spend all summer refuting things, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be quiet... I was told I should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that everything changed and from that moment on I never saw myself out of here – before the Euros, the club told me what my asking price was, and I thought they were going to sell me, but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want me to leave Valencia. That removed all doubt for me. There is no train missed because all that I have achieved is because of Valencia and the Spanish national team." [...] When questioned on whether or not he should apologise to Valencia fans, he simply replied, [...] "I did not kill anyone, I do not think I have to ask for forgiveness." ...|$|E

500|$|Nava praised Beyoncé's {{acting in}} the commercial, stating: [...] "She's so scorchingly hot that even when she touches the floor with her {{dangerous}} high-heels, she kind of sets her world on fire." [...] In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, Beyoncé described the sexual tone of the video stating: [...] "'It's called Heat, so we wanted the ads to be really steamy and dewy. My sexiest moments are when I'm just {{getting out of the}} tub or the shower and I'm clean, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> incorporate that in the ads. The dress was this liquid-y satin. The song Fever I did years ago and always loved it. [...] I got to sing it a bit more whispery, more natural." [...] "Fever" [...] was re-recorded by Beyoncé on two different occasions. Knowles first recorded her version of [...] "Fever" [...] on September 9, 2003 for her film The Fighting Temptations. Before the release of Heat, she recorded [...] "Fever" [...] again for the fragrance's television commercial. After the launch of Heat, the latter version of the song was officially released as a promotional single to the US iTunes Store through Columbia Records on February 8, 2010, to promote the fragrance. It was made available digitally in the United Kingdom the following day.|$|E
500|$|Writers Glen Morgan and James Wong {{developed}} the episode specially for Kristen Cloke, both for her experience as {{the protagonist of}} their series , to translate Morgan's feelings as his friendship with Cloke became an emotional relationship, and for showcasing her acting. Morgan stated, [...] "I knew she {{did a lot of}} characters and voices, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> incorporate that ... I wanted to write something for her that challenged her". Cloke did research on multiple personality disorders before filming, and based the various personalities on people she knew. Morgan also stated that he [...] "wanted to write something for David Duchovny that challenged him." [...] When pitching the idea to director Rob Bowman, the writers stated they wanted [...] "this episode to feel like the part in Ken Burns' Civil War documentary where they read the Sullivan Ballou letter." [...] Michael Massee wanted his characterization of Ephesian to be [...] "normal looking" [...] and [...] "nondemonic", explaining, [...] "You have to believe that he believes his own rap. When he speaks, he's just explaining that 'this is the way it is' – and that's when it gets very scary." [...] The name [...] "Vernon" [...] comes from cult leader David Koresh's real name, and [...] "Ephesian" [...] is taken from one of the books of the Bible.|$|E
500|$|What Love Is Made Of" [...] was premiered during Irish DJ Annie Mac's eponymous {{program on}} BBC Radio 1, on 10 May 2013, though its digital {{download}} only occurred on 5 July 2013. It was serviced as an extended play, {{where it was}} bundled with three remixes, by MK (Mark Kinchen), Felix da Housecat and Brackles. The song was ultimately excluded from Katy's second studio album, entitled Little Red. During an interview with Clash, Katy was asked about why she had not included the song in the album's track listing. To that question, she responded: [...] "I just felt that I wanted to put some music out there, really. Like, 'Aaliyah' from Danger EP is on the album, but I loved collaborating with Jessie Ware. But [...] {{means a lot to}} me , <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get it out there, regardless of whether it was on the album." [...] Having a length of three minutes and fifty-five seconds (3:55), [...] "What Love Is Made Of" [...] is an uptempo dance and house track that has been described as [...] "rave-y" [...] and [...] "trance-y". Its instrumentation contains the sounds of pianos and synthesizers. Jordan Sargent of Spin observed that it continued the musical style first introduced in Katy's 2012 extended play (EP), Danger EP, which was [...] "straight-forward house". Idolator's Sam Lansky compared her performance in the song to recording artist Siobhán Donaghy.|$|E

500|$|After touring {{in support}} of One by One, Dave Grohl was {{uncertain}} {{on what to do}} next with the Foo Fighters. He felt that rushing to do another record would not be creatively rewarding. Grohl considered a possible film score, and began writing acoustic songs, eventually amassing a full album's worth of songs. Grohl, not wanting to make a solo album and accepting the drift from his usual style, brought the songs to the Foo Fighters – [...] "who's to say what we should sound like?". Bassist Nate Mendel replied that the songs' uncharacteristic sound was [...] "why [...] should go on the record." [...] Grohl decided against an acoustic record, saying [...] "I have to have loud rock music in my life somewhere", and decided to make a double album, with [...] "one CD that's all the really heavy rock shit" [...] and another [...] "that's really beautiful, acoustic-based, lower dynamic stuff", which Grohl described as [...] "the bottle and the hangover", and also with the rock record being [...] "my Jack and Coke record" [...] with songs that [...] "I realise I cannot live without that", and the acoustic being [...] "my Sapphire-and-Martini-with-Kylie record". Grohl also stated a decisive moment in making a double album was uploading demos to his computer and realizing he had five hours of music, adding that [...] "we've been a band for 10 years now, this is our fifth record, and I thought it would be boring to just keep making album after album and making videos and playing festivals, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do something special." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{supposed to have}} been shot on film, though a last-minute change by the studio helped introduce a different technology. In 1997, during pre-production on Henry Selick's feature, Monkeybone, the film's cinematographer Pete Kozachik was looking for a type of filming that would streamline the process of integrating stop-motion characters with pre-filmed live actors. After finishing Monkeybone, Kozachik continued to test cameras for a practical means of shooting feature animation digitally. In early 2003, the production unit was not interested in digital capture for stop motion; the team was instead prepping the movie for a film shoot. Two weeks before filming was to begin, Kozachik and visual effects consultant Chris Watts came up with a solution using digital still cameras that was deemed viable by Warner Bros. senior vice president of physical production and visual effects Chris DeFaria. The production then became digital. After testing a dozen different models, Kozachik opted for a basic digital still camera, the Canon EOS-1D Mark II, an off-the-shelf model that was outfitted with adapters to allow the use of Nikon prime lenses (14mm-105mm). Kozachik spoke about why he chose the camera, saying: [...] "One reason I went with this particular camera is that its image chip is just about the same size as Super 35 film negative, so we could use Nikon lenses and treat them like regular 35mm cine lenses and get the same effect—the same depth of field and angle of coverage. I knew {{that we were going to}} be fighting to make this look like a 'real' movie because we weren't shooting on film, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> at least have the optics look like movie optics." ...|$|E
500|$|Freedom Ring was a {{character}} depicted as gay from his debut by his creator Robert Kirkman. Joe Quesada touted him as Marvel Comics' leading gay hero, with stories dedicated to his adventures in Marvel Team-Up. Despite this, the character was killed one month later. His death and general treatment {{was met with}} some negative reactions, including accusations of homophobia, {{particularly with respect to}} the phallic imagery of the death, with the character being killed by being impaled with spikes. Kirkman commented on the controversy, stating [...] "Freedom Ring was always planned as an inexperienced hero who would get beaten up constantly and probably die. I wanted to comment on the fact that most superheroes get their powers and are okay at it... and that's not how life works. During working on the book, I was also noticing that most gay characters... are all about being gay. Straight characters are well-rounded characters who like chicks. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do a well-rounded character who just happened to like dudes. Then I decided to combine the two ideas. In hindsight, yeah, killing a gay character is no good when there are so few of them... but I really had only the best of intentions in mind." [...] Kirkman later stated, [...] "Frankly, with the SMALL amount of gay characters in comics in general, and how unfortunate the portrayals have been thus far, whether intentional or not—I completely understand the backlash on the death of Freedom Ring, regardless of my intentions. If I had it to do all over again... I wouldn't kill him. I regret it more and more as time goes on. I got rid of what? 20% of the gay characters at Marvel by killing off this ONE character. I just never took that stuff into consideration while I was writing." ...|$|E
