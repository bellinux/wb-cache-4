5|$|The {{zebra shark}} feeds {{primarily}} on shelled molluscs, though {{it also takes}} crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes. The slender, flexible body of this shark allows it to wriggle into narrow holes and crevices in search of food, while its small mouth and thickly muscled buccal cavity allow it to create a powerful <b>suction</b> <b>force</b> with which to extract prey.

5|$|Nocturnal in habits, the tawny {{nurse shark}} tends {{to spend the day}} resting in piles of two dozen or more {{individuals}} inside caves or under ledges. At night, it is an active-swimming predator that uses a powerful <b>suction</b> <b>force</b> to extract prey from inside holes and crevices. The diet of this species consists mainly of octopus, though they also take other invertebrates, small bony fishes, and rarely sea snakes. It is aplacental viviparous, meaning the embryos hatch from egg capsules inside the mother. It is the only carpet shark in which the embryos are oophagous, feeding on eggs produced by the mother while inside the uterus. The litter size may be as small as one or two, based on the large size of near-term embryos.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{angelshark}} {{is primarily}} a visual hunter; experiments in nature show that they strike at fish-shaped targets without any electrical, chemical, vibrational, or behavioral cues. At night, they are guided by the bioluminescence of planktonic dinoflagellates and ostracods disturbed by moving prey. This species' visual system is attuned to the wavelengths of light emitted by these planktonic organisms, showing the importance of night hunting. Pacific angelsharks {{are more likely to}} strike at prey approaching from the front. It usually waits until the prey approaches to , as its attack is less accurate beyond this distance. The strike is a stereotyped behavior in which the shark presses the forward lobes of its pectoral fins against the bottom and thrusts its head upwards at up to a 90° angle. Its mouth forms a tube when opened, creating a <b>suction</b> <b>force,</b> while its jaws protude forward to secure the prey between sharp teeth. During the strike, the eyes roll backward into the head for protection. The strike is often completed in under a tenth of a second.|$|E

5|$|The {{leopard shark}} captures prey by {{expanding}} its buccal cavity {{to create a}} <b>suction</b> <b>force,</b> which is facilitated by its labial cartilages swinging forward to form the mouth into a tube. Simultaneously, the shark protrudes its jaws forward to grip the prey between its teeth. As with other sharks, {{the teeth of the}} leopard shark are periodically shed and replaced; it takes 9ndash&12 days for a replacement tooth to move into position. Leopard sharks have been caught with stomachs filled with clam siphons, which the sharks seize before the clams can retract and break off with a levering motion of their bodies. On occasion, the shark tears the entire clam body out of its shell this way. Other sharks examined have had stomachs containing whole innkeeper worms with no bite marks, suggesting that the sharks sucked them out of their burrows. Under a hollow bridge support in San Francisco Bay, a group of leopard sharks and spiny dogfish have been observed feeding on a dense school of anchovies by slowly swimming counterclockwise through the clockwise-swimming school, and swallowing any anchovies that accidentally entered their open mouths.|$|E

In fact, these bristles are simply levers. The <b>suction</b> <b>force</b> exerted by the primed bladder on the door is resisted by the adhesion of its flexible bottom against the soft-sealing velum. The equilibrium depends quite literally on a hair trigger, and the slightest touch to one of the lever hairs will deform the flexible door lip enough to create a tiny gap, breaking the seal.|$|E
25|$|An {{axial fan}} {{is a type}} of a {{compressor}} that increases the pressure of the air flowing through it. The blades of the axial flow fans force air to move parallel to the shaft about which the blades rotate. In other words, the flow is axially in and axially out, linearly, hence their name. The design priorities in an axial fan revolve around the design of the propeller that creates the pressure difference and hence the <b>suction</b> <b>force</b> that retains the flow across the fan. The main components that need to be studied in the designing of the propeller include the number of blades and the design of each blade. Their applications include propellers in aircraft, helicopters, hovercraft, ships and hydrofoils. They are also used in wind tunnels and cooling towers. If the propeller is exercising propulsion, then efficiency is the only parameter of interest and other parameters like power required and flow rate are considered of no interest. In case the propeller is used as a fan, the parameters of interest includes power, flow rate, pressure rise and efficiency.|$|E
40|$|Summary. -Camber {{and twist}} {{is applied to}} the problem of {{reducing}} the drag due to incidence, of thin triangular or swept-back wings, at supersonic speeds, with subsonic leading edges and supersonic or sonic trailing edges. Two cases are considered: (i) with leading-edge <b>suction</b> <b>forces</b> ignored, (ii) with leading-edge <b>suction</b> <b>forces</b> included. It is found that twist, especially towards the wing tips, is more effective in reducing drag, for given lift, for the larger values of tan yjtan u, where y is the semi-apex-angle and ft is the Mach angle, and that camber is more effective for the smaller values, though, in general, the best results are obtained by a suitable combination of camber and twist. For triangular wings, with suction ignored, the maximum percentage drag reduction varies from about 10 per cent (for sonic leading edges) to 50 per cent (for very slender plan-forms) and, if <b>suction</b> <b>forces</b> are included, from zero (for very slender plan-forms) to about 10 per cent (when the leading edges are sonic). The effect of the swept-back trailing edge is, in general, to increase the maximum percentage drag reduction for given lift if <b>suction</b> <b>forces</b> are ignored; but to decrease the maximum reduction for smaller values of tan yjtan ft, and to increase the maximum reduction for values of tan yjtan ft near to one, if <b>suction</b> <b>forces</b> are included. [...] _~ 1. Introduction. -In Ref. 1, the effect of camber and twist on the pressure distribution and drag on some triangular wings of zero thickness, at supersonic speeds but with subsonic leading edges, is investigated.

40|$|A new {{technique}} to improve Woodward's (1968) unified subsonic and supersonic panel method is described. The pressure prediction is improved {{based on a}} new two-dimensional theory. The method used by Lan (1977) is then {{used to calculate the}} leading-edge and side-edge <b>suction</b> <b>forces</b> by direct use of the predicted pressure distribution. The method is applicable to both subsonic and supersonic flow. It is shown that the improved Woodward panel method is capable of accurately predicting leading-edge and side-edge <b>suction</b> <b>forces</b> in subsonic and supersonic flow. Therefore, the method can be used not only to predict the vortex lift of complex planforms through the method of suction analogy, but also to calculate some lateral-directional stability derivatives...|$|R
50|$|Similarly to {{propeller}} vehicles, some vehicles use wings for propulsion. Sailboats and sailplanes are {{propelled by}} the forward component of lift generated by their sails/wings.

50|$|Aulostomids {{are highly}} {{carnivorous}} fish. They stalk their prey by hovering almost motionlessly {{a few inches}} above the substrate, inching their way towards unsuspecting prey.

50|$|Flat slab {{subduction}} can commonly {{be explained}} by oceanic plateau subduction and a fast overriding plate. Central Mexico's flat subduction is not evident. The Trans-Mexican Volcanic belt's flat slab is confined between ~101°W and 96°W; this region may {{be explained by}} thicker continental crust. Existence of thick strong crust combined with decreasing fluid input contributed to narrowing the asthenospheric wedge, increasing viscosity and <b>suction</b> <b>forces,</b> which led to flat subduction—preventing the oceanic plate from entering the mantle.|$|R
50|$|Nano-suction is a {{technology}} that uses vacuum, negative fluid pressure and millions of nano-sized suction cups to securely adhere any object to a flat non-porous surface.

50|$|If larger {{trees are}} removed from the toe area of a slope there will be both a {{reduction}} in soil strength due {{to the loss of}} evapotranspiration effects and a reduction in applied loading which may result in temporary suctions in clay soils which could lead to softening as the available water is drawn in to compensate for the <b>suction</b> <b>forces.</b> This is similar to the recognised softening of overconsolidated clays due to the relaxation of overburden pressures when placed in the top layers of an embankment from deep cutting.|$|R
50|$|Twist or {{torsional}} deformation {{define the}} base-to-apex gradient {{and is the}} result of myocardial shearing in the circumferential-longitudinal planes such that, when viewed from the apex, the base rotates in a counterclockwise direction. Likewise the LV apex concomitantly rotates in a clockwise direction. During ejection, LV torsion results in the storage of potential energy into the deformed myofibers. This stored energy is released with the onset of relaxation similar to a spring uncoiling and results in <b>suction</b> <b>forces.</b> These forces are then used for rapid early diastolic restoration.|$|R
50|$|Tentacles are {{the major}} organs used by squid for {{defending}} and hunting. They are often confused with arms - octopuses have eight arms, while squid and cuttlefish have eight arms and two tentacles.

50|$|Slab <b>suction</b> <b>forces</b> {{are one of}} {{the major}} plate tectonic driving <b>forces.</b> Slab <b>suction</b> occurs when a subducting slab drives flow in the nearby mantle.

50|$|Alternative {{sump pump}} {{systems can be}} driven by {{municipal}} water pressure. Water-powered sump pumps are similar to backup-battery-driven systems with a separate pump, float and check valves. During installation, the float is mounted in the sump pit above the normal high water mark. Under normal conditions, your main electric powered sump pump will handle all the pumping duties. When water rises higher than normal for any reason, the backup float in the sump is lifted and activates the backup sump pump. As municipal water rushes through the ejector, it creates a powerful <b>suction</b> <b>force</b> which causes the PVC pipe {{to act like a}} giant soda straw, drawing water up from the sump and ejecting it outdoors.

40|$|Suction {{caissons}} {{are increasingly}} becoming {{the foundation of}} choice for offshore structures in deep water. They are used extensively in Tension Leg Platforms and provide the most efficient foundations for many offshore wind turbine structures. One of their major advantages {{is the ability to}} withstand large uplift forces by mobilizing shear on their external and internal surface and by the <b>suction</b> <b>forces</b> induced in the enclosed soil plug. These <b>suction</b> <b>forces</b> can be relied upon for short-term loading, while the behaviour of the soil remains undrained, but are more questionable for the sustained loading induced by storms and loop currents. This study uses finite element analysis to investigate the uplift capacity of suction caissons under three loading conditions: a) short-term undrained loading, b) long-term drained loading and c) sustained loading for short and long periods of time. The study compares the capacity from 5 different geometries with length to diameter ratios, L/d = 0. 5, 0. 65, 1, 2 and 3 under these three loading conditions. For the sustained loading case, a minimum time under which the load can be sustained is established for different load levels. The commercial finite element program Plaxis is used and a Mohr-Coulomb model is assumed for the soil. Comparisons are presented between the results of this study, the theoretical Mohr-Coulomb model predictions and other finite element analysis found in the research for undrained and drained loading. by Christina G.
