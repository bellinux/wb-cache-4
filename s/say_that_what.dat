It's funny because Ace is such a sweet man - and you haven't even seen the worst of Yusef yet!" [...] Wadia continued: [...] "Let's just <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> happens is the complete opposite of what you want to see. Zainab and Yusef share a dark and twisted love, and she definitely has feelings for him. It's not true and pure like what she used to have with Masood - and if Yusef manages to get her back to Pakistan, it will be the end for her. I wouldn't be surprised if Zainab ends up in some sort of home to recover from everything that's going to happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Anwar Ibrahim, former UMNO deputy President {{and former}} Deputy Prime Minister, whose Parti Keadilan Rakyat became the second-largest party in Parliament after the elections, and {{the de facto}} leader of the {{opposition}} Pakatan Rakyat coalition, chose to instead reject ketuanan Melayu in favour of [...] "ketuanan rakyat" [...] (people's supremacy). Celebrating the end of his five-year ban from political activity on 15 April 2008, he told reporters: [...] "We are here to counter the massive propaganda campaign by Umno leaders, who are talking on Malay supremacy. And giving clear definitive answer in reply of this, to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> we want, what we desire for is a new Malaysia, is supremacy for all Malaysians." [...] A week later, his wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, president of PKR, told the press that [...] "we should not keep talking about Malay supremacy or marginalising a certain race, which is not what the people want to see," [...] urging instead the adoption of ketuanan rakyat.|$|E

500|$|John D. F. Black's {{original}} pitch {{featured a}} story about capital punishment. His idea {{was based on a}} film treatment detailing the colony planet of Llarof where capital punishment is handed down as a sentence for any offense except against those who are immune from the law. In the treatment, a security officer is killed by a local law enforcement officer, who is then killed himself by his partner for unjustly killing the Enterprise crewman. The planet would have had a rebel faction who wanted to overthrow the laws, which Picard refused to back initially whilst citing the Prime Directive. A second draft featured a rebel leader executed for treason. Black explained the premise of a society that developed laws to prevent terrorism and chaos: [...] "Let's <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> we do is kill everybody who is a terrorist or suspected of being a terrorist. Now the people who have killed everybody, what do they do?" ...|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{incorporated}} utopian {{themes in}} his previous works but reviewers were divided on whether The Years of Rice and Salt qualified as a utopian story. Those that did call the world described in the story as utopian cited the story's illustration of progress. However, those that wrote The Years of Rice and Salt was not a utopian story say that the world history presented is not necessarily better or worse than the real history, just different. Robinson calls himself a [...] "utopian novelist" [...] in that he claims [...] "all science fiction has a utopian element, in that it tends to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> we do now matters and will have consequences". Several other themes were identified by reviewers. Robinson had previously used the theme of memory (or identity) and incorporates it into this story with characters who are reincarnated versions of previous characters and who only recognize each other while in the bardo, but sometimes feel a connection between themselves while on earth. The reviewer in The Globe and Mail identified feminism and [...] "struggles over the nature of Islam" [...] as recurring themes.|$|E

A study in Applied Animal Behaviour Science said Millan has been influential in popularizing punitive techniques, but that bad behavior from dogs was caused by fear and anxiety, not a lack of the owner's alpha status. A journalist from The New Yorker said that critics were responding to a [...] "highly edited" [...] version of his approach on television, which exaggerates the frequency and intensity that he uses when he disciplines the dogs.|$|E

2500|$|Aside {{from the}} issues of {{legality}} in some countries and states and of sometime opposition the effectiveness of speed cameras is very well documented. The introduction to [...] by Richard Allsop includes the following in the foreword by Professor Stephen Glaister, Director of the RAC (Royal Automobile Club). [...] "While this report fully lays out the background {{to the introduction of}} speed cameras and the need for speed limits, its job is not to justify why the national limits are what they are; a review of speed limits to see whether they are soundly based is for another day. What it has done is to show that at camera sites, speeds have been reduced, and that as a result, collisions resulting in injuries have fallen. The government has said that a decision on whether speed cameras should be funded must be taken at a local level. With the current pressure on public funds, there will be – indeed there already are – those who <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> little money there is can be better spent. This report begs to differ. The devices are already there; they demonstrate value for money, yet are not significant revenue raisers for the Treasury; they are shown to save lives; and despite the headlines, most people accept the need for them. Speed cameras should never be the only weapon in the road safety armoury, but neither should they be absent from the battle." ...|$|E
