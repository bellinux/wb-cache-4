5|$|During {{battles in}} Soviet Union in 1941 and 1942, the Waffen-SS {{suffered}} enormous casualties. The LSSAH and Das Reich lost over half their troops to illness and combat casualties. In need of recruits, Himmler began to accept <b>soldiers</b> <b>that</b> {{did not fit}} the original SS racial profile. In early 1942, SS-Leibstandarte, SS-Totenkopf, and SS-Das Reich were withdrawn to the West to refit and were converted to Panzergrenadier divisions. The SS-Panzer Corps returned to the Soviet Union in 1943 and participated in the Third Battle of Kharkov in February and March.|$|E
5|$|Her {{death was}} widely publicised shortly {{afterwards}} by the Polish press, which contributed to her growing fame. Plater {{became one of}} the symbols of the uprising. The symbol of the fighting girl became quite widespread both in Poland, Lithuania and abroad. Mickiewicz immortalized her in his poem, Śmierć pułkownika (Death of a Colonel), although the description of her death is a pure poetical fiction and was only loosely based on her real life. Mickiewicz has also idealized her personality and skills, portraying her as the ideal commander, worshiped by her <b>soldiers.</b> <b>That</b> poem has entered the elementary curriculum in the independent Poland.|$|E
5|$|On 21 June 1940 the Central Landing Establishment {{was formed}} at Ringway {{airfield}} near Manchester.

The result was the General Aircraft Hotspur, an aircraft capable of transporting eight <b>soldiers,</b> <b>that</b> was used for both assault and training purposes.|$|E

5|$|On September 27, 1835, a {{detachment}} of 100 dragoons, led by Francisco de Castañeda, left San Antonio de Béxar, carrying an official order for Ponton to surrender the cannon.

When the troops neared Gonzales on September 29, {{they found that the}} settlers had removed the ferry and all other boats from the Guadalupe River. On {{the other side of the}} swiftly moving river waited eighteen Texians. Albert Martin, captain of the Gonzales militia, informed the <b>soldiers</b> <b>that</b> Ponton was out of town, and until his return the army must remain on the west side of the river.|$|E
5|$|The American {{prisoners were}} quickly {{returned}} to the United States, most by plane. Those who were still sick or weakened remained at American hospitals to continue to recuperate. On February11, 1945, 280 POWs left Leyte aboard the transport USS General A.E. Anderson bound for San Francisco via Hollandia, New Guinea. In an effort to counter the improved American morale, Japanese propaganda radio announcers broadcast to American <b>soldiers</b> <b>that</b> submarines, ships, and planes were hunting the General Anderson. The threats {{proved to be a}} bluff, and the ship safely arrived in San Francisco Bay on March8, 1945.|$|E

5|$|The {{rejection}} of their protest greatly upset the German forces, {{because they believed}} they were treated unjustly in the war. Shortly after the protest was rejected, Germany issued threats that they would punish all captured American <b>soldiers</b> <b>that</b> {{were found to be}} armed with a shotgun. This led to the United States issuing a retaliation threat, stating that any measures unjustly taken against captured American soldiers would lead to an equal act by the United States on captured German soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The siege {{culminated in}} an early-morning assault by Mexican troops which left {{almost all of}} the {{defenders}} dead. Some reports claimed that several Texians surrendered but were quickly executed on Santa Anna's orders. Of the Texians who fought during the battle, only two survived: Travis's slave, Joe, was assumed by the Mexican soldiers to be a noncombatant, and Brigido Guerrero, who had deserted from the Mexican Army several months before, convinced the Mexican <b>soldiers</b> <b>that</b> he had been taken prisoner by the Texians. Alamo co-commander James Bowie's freedman, Sam, was also spared, although it is not known if he participated in the fighting.|$|E

5|$|At {{independence}} on 30 June 1960, {{the army}} {{suffered from a}} dramatic deficit of trained leaders, particularly in the officer corps. This was because the Force Publique had always only been officered by Belgian or other expatriate whites. The Belgian Government {{made no effort to}} train Congolese commissioned officers until {{the very end of the}} colonial period, and in 1958, only 23 African cadets had been admitted even to the military secondary school. The highest rank available to Congolese was adjutant, which only four soldiers achieved before independence. Though 14 Congolese cadets were enrolled in the Royal Military Academy in Brussels in May, they were not scheduled to graduate as second lieutenants until 1963. Ill-advised actions by Belgian officers led to an enlisted ranks' rebellion on 5 July 1960, which helped spark the Congo Crisis. Lieutenant General Émile Janssens, the Force Publique commander, wrote during a meeting of <b>soldiers</b> <b>that</b> 'Before independence=After Independence', pouring cold water on the soldiers' desires for an immediate raise in their status.|$|E

5|$|By {{the year}} 737, Emperor Xuanzong {{discarded}} {{the policy of}} conscripting <b>soldiers</b> <b>that</b> were replaced every three years, replacing them with long-service soldiers who were more battle-hardened and efficient. It was more economically feasible as well, since training new recruits and sending {{them out to the}} frontier every three years drained the treasury. By the late 7th century, the fubing troops began abandoning military service and the homes provided to them in the equal-field system. The supposed standard of 100 mu of land allotted to each family was in fact decreasing in size in places where population expanded and the wealthy bought up most of the land. Hard-pressed peasants and vagrants were then induced into military service with benefits of exemption from both taxation and corvée labor service, as well as provisions for farmland and dwellings for dependents who accompanied soldiers on the frontier. By the year 742 the total number of enlisted troops in the Tang armies had risen to about 500,000 men.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil War (18611865), cavalry {{held the}} most {{important}} and respected role it would ever hold in the American military. Field artillery in the American Civil War was also highly mobile. Both horses and mules pulled the guns, though only horses were used on the battlefield. At the beginning of the war, most of the experienced cavalry officers were from the South and thus joined the Confederacy, leading to the Confederate Army's initial battlefield superiority. The tide turned at the 1863 Battle of Brandy Station, part of the Gettysburg campaign, where the Union cavalry, in the largest cavalry battle ever fought on the American continent, ended the dominance of the South. By 1865, Union cavalry were decisive in achieving victory. So important were horses to individual <b>soldiers</b> <b>that</b> the surrender terms at Appomattox allowed every Confederate cavalryman to take his horse home with him. This was because, unlike their Union counterparts, Confederate cavalrymen provided their own horses for service instead of drawing them from the government.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus' {{divisions}} met {{up to the}} north, and ravaged {{the countryside}} between the Ems and the Lippe, and penetrated to the Teutoburg Forest, a mountain forest in Western Germany situated between these two rivers. There, Germanicus {{and some of his}} men visited the site of the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, and began burying the remains of the Roman <b>soldiers</b> <b>that</b> had been left in the open. After half a day of the work, he called off the burial of bones so that they could continue their war against the Germans. He made his way into the heartland of the Cherusci. At a location Tacitus calls the pontes longi ("long causeways"), in boggy lowlands somewhere near the Ems, Arminius' troops attacked the Romans. Arminius initially caught Germanicus' cavalry in a trap, inflicting minor casualties, but the Roman infantry reinforced the rout and checked them. The fighting lasted for two days, with neither side achieving a decisive victory. Germanicus' forces withdrew and returned to the Rhine.|$|E
