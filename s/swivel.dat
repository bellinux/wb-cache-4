The broken objects may have been kept so they could later be repaired, or may have just been used for ballast. There were four anchors in working condition.|$|E
5|$|Some jumping spiders' {{visual acuity}} exceeds {{by a factor}} of ten that of dragonflies, which have by far the best vision among insects; in fact the human eye is only about five times sharper than a jumping spider's. They achieve this by a telephoto-like series of lenses, a four-layer retina and the ability to <b>swivel</b> their eyes and {{integrate}} images from different stages in the scan. The downside is that the scanning and integrating processes are relatively slow.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships were}} also armed with six 45cm torpedo tubes, all in above-water <b>swivel</b> mounts. Four tubes were {{mounted on the}} sides of the ship, another in the bow, and the last in the stern. These weapons were 5.1m (16ft9in) long and carried an 87.5kg (193lb) TNT warhead. They could be set at two speeds for {{different}} ranges. At , the torpedoes had a range of 800m (870yd). At an increased speed of , the range was reduced to 500m (550yb).|$|E
5|$|Thrust is {{provided}} by four Rolls-Royce Mermaid azimuth thruster type podded propulsion units, each featuring one forward-facing low-vibration propeller with separately bolted blades. The forward pair of thrusters is fixed, but the aft pair can <b>swivel</b> through 360°, removing {{the need for a}} rudder. The Queen Mary 2 is the first quadruple-propeller passenger ship completed since the SS France in 1961. Queen Mary 2 carries eight spare blades on the foredeck, immediately forward of the bridge screen.|$|E
5|$|Between 1761 and 1790, 14-15 turumas were built, {{including}} Amphion, {{a modified}} version used by King Gustav III as both a pleasure craft and command ship. The turuma was among the heaviest in the arsenal of the archipelago fleet {{and a number of}} them served in the Russo-Swedish War of 1788–90. It had three masts, two decks and was equipped with 16–22 pairs of oars along with a crew of about 220–260. Its length was 35–39m, width 9m and the draft 3,3m. The armament consisted of 24–28 heavy guns with up to 24 <b>swivel</b> guns for close-quarter combat.|$|E

5|$|On 21 July 1768, Endeavour {{sailed to}} Galleon's Reach {{to take on}} armaments to protect her against {{potentially}} hostile Pacific island natives. Ten 4-pounder cannons were brought aboard, six of which were mounted on the upper deck and the remainder stowed in the hold. Twelve <b>swivel</b> guns were also supplied, and fixed to posts along the quarterdeck, sides and bow. The ship departed for Plymouth on 30 July, for provisioning and to board her crew of 85, including 12Royal Marines. Cook also ordered that twelve tons of pig iron be brought on board as sailing ballast.|$|E
5|$|The first turuma, Norden, was c. 35m (116ft) {{long and}} 8m (26.5ft) wide with {{a draft of}} 3.3m (11ft). By the third ship, the Lodbrok (1771), the hull had been {{expanded}} to 38.5m (126ft) by 9.5m (31ft) and remained roughly the same. The armament was considerably heavier {{than that of the}} galleys, or the smaller udemas and pojomas. It had one full gundeck of 22 (24 in the ships built before 1790) 12-pounders in a regular broadside arrangement, firing through gunports. On the forecastle deck facing straight forward were two 18-pounders. For close-range action it carried another up to 24 3-pound <b>swivel</b> guns along the railings. In addition, there was also two 12-pound stern chasers.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the guns were small iron guns with short range that could be aimed and fired by a single person. The two most common are the bases, breech-loading <b>swivel</b> guns, most likely placed in the castles, and hailshot pieces, small muzzle-loaders with rectangular bores and fin-like protrusions {{that were used to}} support the guns against the railing and allow the ship structure to take the force of the recoil. Though the design is unknown, there were two top pieces in a 1546 inventory (finished after the sinking) which was probably similar to a base, but placed in {{one or more of the}} fighting tops.|$|E
40|$|International audienceDynamic {{simulations}} {{under stress}} {{were carried out}} {{on a series of}} main-chain polymers containing two types of mesogen. One mesogen is orientated in-line with the chain (end-to-end), the second mesogen (<b>swivelling)</b> has the main chain passing at right angles through it. Under strain the <b>swivelling</b> mesogens are expected to rotate, pushing apart neighbouring chains. Polymers incorporating 50 % of both mesogens showed a reduced Poisson's ratio. In particular, <b>swivelling</b> mesogens of seven rings length produced a negative Poisson's ratio, and thus should be auxetic. In contrast, polymers containing only end-to-end mesogens had relatively high Poisson's ratios of 0. 53 - 0. 59...|$|R
5000|$|Constructing a trotline {{is quite}} simple. Basic {{supplies}} needed are fishing hooks, clamps, <b>swivels,</b> fishing line, and a durable cord or lightweight rope {{used for the}} main line. Before constructing the trotline, {{it is a good}} idea to measure the span of the body of water being fished in order to give the main line an appropriate length. Once this is done, drop lines are set along the main line by threading clamps on the line with <b>swivels</b> between them. Fishing line is attached to the <b>swivels</b> and hooks are tied to the end of the fishing line.|$|R

5|$|The present {{bridge of}} seven arches was erected by the Commissioners for the Improvement of Navigation of the Shannon in 1841–1843. The {{engineer}} was Thomas Rhodes, {{one of the}} commissioners of the Shannon Navigation, whose name {{can be seen on}} many of the bridges over the Shannon and on surviving lock mechanisms, notably at Victoria and Athlone locks. This bridge was reconstructed and widened jointly by Offaly County Council and Galway County Council in 1971. Their work included replacing massive stone parapets {{on either side of the}} bridge with aluminium railings, and the removal of a <b>swivel</b> arch which had allowed passage for masted boats.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper level}} {{contains}} {{a mix of}} seating options. At one end are eight tables, four to each side, each seating four passengers. In the center is a lounge area with a wet bar and several groups of seats. The stairs to the lower level are located here as well. At the other end are <b>swivel</b> chairs. The lower level contains a bathroom, additional tables, and a snack bar. As built, the lounges had seating for 73. The cars were built with an electric piano in the lower level, which has since been removed.|$|E
5|$|A narrow quay passes {{under the}} old <b>swivel</b> section of the bridge from Waller's Quay to the marina. A well-worn {{handrail}} offers the pedestrian some protection against a slip into the river. This rail has been known as the Duke's Rail since in 1897 the then Duke of York, later to become George V, paid a state visit to Ireland. The royal party travelled up-river from Portumna on the steamship Countess of Mayo. Disembarking at Waller's Quay, the Duke was received by Lord Rosse, the Lord Lieutenant of King's County. The party had to traverse the narrow quay under the bridge to get to Banagher Railway Station, and undoubtedly made good use of the Duke's Rail. The stretch of the Shannon from Portumna to Banagher was {{known for some time}} after as the Duke of York's Route.|$|E

5|$|Safety {{features}} on Lexus models range from {{stability and handling}} programs (Vehicle Stability Control and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management) to backup cameras, <b>swivel</b> headlights, and sonar warning systems. The Lexus Pre-Collision System (PCS) integrates multiple safety systems. In 2007, Lexus introduced the first car safety systems with infrared and pedestrian detection capabilities, lane keep assist, a Driver Monitoring System with facial recognition monitoring of driver attentiveness, and rear pre-collision whiplash protection, {{as part of the}} LS 460 PCS. As a safety precaution, Lexus GPS navigation systems in many regions feature a motion lockout when the vehicle reaches a set speed; to prevent distraction, navigation inputs are limited, while voice input and certain buttons are still accessible. This safety feature has attracted criticism because passengers cannot use certain functions when the vehicle is in motion. Pre-2007 models came with a hidden manufacturer override option, and updated European models allow operation in motion.|$|E
5|$|Sercey's {{flagship}} {{during these}} operations was the 40-gun frigate Forte. Forte, commanded by the elderly Captain Hubert Le Loup de Beaulieu, {{had been built}} in 1794 based on the hull and frame of a ship of the line: the frigate weighed 1,400 tons bm, the largest purpose-built frigate at sea. The main battery of Forte consisted of 28 24-pounder long guns, only the second frigate ever built (after Pomone) which could manage such a heavy armament. This was augmented by fourteen 8-pounder long guns on the upper deck and eight 36-pounder carronades on the quarterdeck, totaling 52 heavy cannon complemented by eight 1-pounder <b>swivel</b> guns. Uniquely, {{the sides of the}} ship were lined with cork matting to prevent splinters while the more common precaution had been taken of stringing netting over the deck to protect the crew from falling debris. The ship was however weakened by an ill-disciplined crew, and Sercey had expressed doubts about the ability of the aged Beaulieu.|$|E
5|$|The cannon's fate is disputed. According to the memoirs (written in the 1890s) of Gonzales {{blacksmith}} Noah Smithwick, {{the cannon}} was abandoned after the cart's axles began to smoke during a march to San Antonio de Béxar {{to assist in}} Austin's siege. Smithwick reported that the cannon was buried near a creek not far from Gonzales. A small iron cannon was exposed during a June 1936 flood near Gonzales. In 1979, this cannon was purchased by Dr. Patrick Wagner, who believed it matched Smithwick's descriptions of the cannon used in the battle. The Curator of Military History at the Smithsonian Institution verified that Wagner's cannon was a type of small <b>swivel</b> gun used in America through 1836. The Conservation Laboratory at the University of Texas confirmed that Wagner's cannon had been buried in moist ground for an extended time period.|$|E

The first story also contains two bathrooms, four small storage closets, and a central hall, as well as a large stairwell leading up to the second floor. The second story contains three classrooms, with the same features as those downstairs, along with an office and three small storage rooms.

The schoolhouse also has a partial basement, which contains a large storage room, a coal room, and a disused coal furnace.|$|E
5|$|Debate {{has been}} going on about whether the tail spikes were used for display only, as posited by Gilmore in 1914 or used as a weapon. Robert Bakker noted the tail was likely to have been much more {{flexible}} than that of other dinosaurs, as it lacked ossified tendons, thus lending credence to the idea of the tail as a weapon. However, as Carpenter has noted, the plates overlap so many tail vertebrae, movement would be limited. Bakker also observed that Stegosaurus could have maneuvered its rear easily, by keeping its large hind limbs stationary and pushing off with its very powerfully muscled but short fore limbs, allowing it to <b>swivel</b> deftly to deal with attack. More recently, a study of tail spikes by McWhinney et al., which showed a high incidence of trauma-related damage, lends more weight to the position that the spikes were indeed used in combat. This study showed that 9.8% of Stegosaurus specimens examined had injuries to their tail spikes. Additional support for this idea was a punctured tail vertebra of an Allosaurus into which a tail spike fits perfectly.|$|E
5|$|For an {{hour the}} {{officers}} drank, Malcolm and Cooke learning {{detailed information about}} the state of the defences and squadron in the Philippines, until a second boat pulled alongside Fox containing more officers keen to greet the French arrivals. This vessel was the personal barge of the Spanish commander at Cavite, Rear-Admiral Don Ignacio María de Álava, who was not aboard, but who sent a message via an aide in a third boat. Each time, the officers were escorted below to join the festivities whereupon their crews were seized at gunpoint and taken below decks as prisoners of war. In Malcolm's cabin, the captured officers were informed of their situation, promised release before the British frigates sailed, and offered more wine. The crew of Fox meanwhile forced the captured Spanish sailors to strip and donned their clothing. Climbing into the Spanish boats this party rowed for the mouth of the nearby Pasig River, where they had learned that three heavy gunboats were moored. Taking the crews by surprise, the British boarding parties drove off the Spanish without a fight and brought all three boats alongside Fox. These vessels normally carried crews of thirty and were well-armed, one with a 32-pounder long gun and two with 24-pounder long guns, each supplemented by four <b>swivel</b> guns.|$|E
