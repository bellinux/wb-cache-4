5|$|To {{some extent}} {{this is due}} to {{geography}} and driver training, but more rigorous impaired driving enforcement and severe penalties in Sweden for driving under the influence may also explain the difference. While it might be argued that highways and vehicles in Sweden are different from those in the United States, the U.S. fatality rate is also about double the rate in the Canadian province of Ontario, which experienced 3.6 road fatalities per 1 billion vehicle-km according to preliminary 2014 data. Ontario, which is a vast province of more than 1 million square kilometers, has a similar mix of highway types including congested urban and rural highways. Ontario also has a similar mix of large transport trucks essentially identical to U.S. transport trucks, full-sized pickup trucks, SUVs and passenger cars, although there may be more <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> driven in Ontario compared to the United States. This suggests that differences in fatality rates are due to non-physical factors such as driver behavior.|$|E

25|$|Before the Primula, all Fiat Group {{passenger}} cars were rear-wheel drive; the larger models followed the classic FR layout (front engine powering the rear axle), and <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> were rear-engined. Meanwhile, a practical concept emerged, namely the front-wheel drive layout {{with the engine}} mounted transversely, which allowed for very efficient space utilization. Although invented by Fiat, it was first popularized by the Mini, it also {{found its way to}} other, bigger models, starting with BMC's Austin/Morris 1100.|$|E

The appearance of Japanese brands like Acura and Lexus in subsequent years meant the loss of a significant market share for Volvo, one which they have never regained.|$|E

The report estimated that an automaker needed to sell ten <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> {{to make the same}} profit as one big vehicle, and that they had to produce small and mid-size cars profitably to succeed, something that the Detroit three had trouble doing.|$|E

When Peugeot launched the stylish all-new 205 in 1983, the 104 was withdrawn from most European markets, including Britain. But it continued in France as a budget choice until production finally ceased in May 1988 after 16 years in which time 1,624,992 Peugeot 104s had been built. 345,849 of these were the short wheelbase Coupé versions.|$|E
25|$|Volkswagen {{entered the}} {{supermini}} market in 1975 with the Volkswagen Polo, a stylish and spacious three-door hatchback designed by Bertone. It {{was a strong}} seller in West Germany {{and most of the}} rest of Western Europe, being one of the first foreign <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> to prove popular in Britain. It had started out in 1974 as the Audi 50, which was only available in certain markets and was less popular. The Polo entered a market sector already being dominated by the Fiat 127 and Renault 5, and which before long would also include the Austin Metro and Ford Fiesta.|$|E
25|$|International Automobile Importers (IAI) was {{a company}} founded by Malcolm Bricklin to import the X1/9 and 2000 Spider after Fiat halted their manufacture.

Bricklin wanted to import additional brands, and international dealmaker Armand Hammer had been asked by the Yugoslavs to identify business areas {{in which they could}} generate exports to bolster their economy. Hammer thought the idea of exporting the <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> made in Kragujevac, Serbia, by Zavodi Crvena Zastava, would be viable. Zastava had, since the mid-19th century, been a quality armaments producer and sponsored its own museum.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the Big Three could enjoy profit margins of $10,000 per SUV, while losing {{a few hundred}} dollars on a compact car. Consequently, these {{companies}} focused resources and design on SUVs over <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> (compact cars were sold mainly to attract young buyers with inexpensive options and to increase their fleet average fuel economies to meet federal standards). As a result of the shift in the Big Three's strategy, many long-running compact and midsize cars like the Ford Taurus, Buick Century, and Pontiac Grand Prix eventually fell behind their Japanese competition in features and image (relying more upon fleet sales instead of retail and/or heavy incentive discounts), some eventually being discontinued.|$|E
25|$|A drop in Jeep sales {{caused by}} the declining economy and soaring energy prices began to constrict AMC's cash flow. At the same time, {{pressure}} increased on the company's non-Jeep product lines. The face-lifts and rebranding of AMC's once-innovative and successful cars were not enough in a competitive landscape that had changed dramatically. No longer was the threat limited to the Big Three automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler). The Japanese manufacturers (Honda, Toyota, Nissan) used streamlined production methods such as outsourcing and Just In Time (JIT) supply-chain management. They had new, highly efficient assembly plants in the United States. And now they targeted the heart of AMC's passenger product line: <b>small</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|E
