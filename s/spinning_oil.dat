50|$|Julichen nunnery is {{subordinate}} to the main monastery. It sustains {{the needs of the}} monastery. The 26 nuns who reside here are taken care by the Governing Body of the main Monastery. The nuns fully participate in the economic activity of the monastery and have to work whole day to fully support the economic enterprises of the monastery. It is said that the young nuns who are more educated and candid took to religious curriculum of meditation and Tibetan philosophy, while the older nuns toiled on the fields in the furtherance of the economic activity of the monastery. The nuns are also trained in <b>spinning,</b> <b>oil</b> extraction from apricot nuts and milking cows.|$|E
30|$|The viscosities of the SP {{solutions}} {{were determined}} at a shear rate of 7.34  s− 1 with HAAKE Rotational Rheometer- 6000 at 78  °C. The IFTs between the surfactant solutions and oil were measured at 78  °C with a spinning drop tension meter (Model Texas- 500). The <b>spinning</b> <b>oil</b> droplet was stretched in the chemical agent solution until the oil/water phase reached equilibrium at a rotation speed of 6, 000 r/min. The images were stored at regular intervals. In the images, {{the height of}} the <b>spinning</b> <b>oil</b> drop was measured to calculate the IFT when the ratio of the length to the height of oil drop was more than 4. However, length and height should be measured only when the ratio of the length to {{the height of the}} oil drop is between 1 and 4. The IFTs of the different concentrations of the surfactant were obtained with the abovementioned surfactants or their mixtures with a polymer.|$|E
40|$|Solvent {{extraction}}s of many {{samples of}} cotton {{showed that the}} usual methods of wax extraction are not always adequate for general use, particularly on cottons whose extractable matter has been changed by manufacturing operations such as the addition of <b>spinning</b> <b>oil</b> or warp size, or the removal of part of the wax by bleaching processes. The usual simple extractions may be satisfactory for routiue work on raw or processed cottons if the solvent is selected according {{to the type of}} cotton and to the purpose of the extraction. If, however, an accurate estimation of amount of wax is needed, a more inclusive method is desirable. The alcohol-chloroform extraction procedure developed by Conrad is shown to be such a method. Several of the various other methods of extraction discussed are more suitable for dewaxing cotton for special uses than for analysis for wax content...|$|E

40|$|A new <b>spinning</b> <b>oil</b> film (SOF) solid-in-oil-in-oil {{emulsion}} {{process was}} developed to produce uniform-sized proteinloaded biodegradable microspheres. A thin SOF on a cylindrical rotor was used to shear droplets from a nozzle tip to control droplet size. The resulting microspheres with low polydispersity (6 %) produced a low burst (6 %– 11 %) release even at high loadings (13 %– 18 % encapsulated solids, 8 %– 12 % protein). The SOF process had a high yield and did not require the presence of water, which can cause protein denaturation, or surfactants, which may be unwanted in the final product. Amorphous protein and crystalline excipient solids were encapsulated into 3 different polymers, giving a homogenous drug distribution throughout the microspheres, and an essentially complete protein encapsulation efficiency (average= 99 %). In contrast, large burst release was observed for polydisperse microspheres produced by a conventional emulsification technique, particularly for microspheres smaller than 25 μm in diameter, which gave 93 % burst at 15 % loading. The uniform encapsulation of high loadings of proteins into microspheres with low polydispersity in an anhydrous process is of practical interest {{in the development of}} controlled-release protein therapeutics...|$|E

50|$|The Wood River Refinery is an oil {{refinery}} located in Roxana, Illinois, approximately 15 mi north of St. Louis, Missouri, {{on the east}} side of the Mississippi River. The refinery is currently owned by Phillips 66 and Cenovus Energy, and operated by the joint-venture company WRB Refining, LLC (WRB). WRB was formed on 1 July 2007, with Encana taking a 49% interest in Wood River and also Phillips 66's Borger refinery. Encana subsequently <b>spun</b> off <b>oil</b> sands producer Cenovus and ConocoPhillips spun off Phillips 66. In return for a 49% stake in the refinery, ConocoPhillips gained a joint interest in two Alberta oil sands (bitumen) heavy oil projects: Christina Lake (Alberta) and Foster Creek. ConocoPhillips’ interest was sold to Cenovus in May 2017, leaving Cenovus the sole owner and operator of the assets. Cenovus uses SAGD (steam-assisted gravity drainage) technology at those sites.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, Crompton ran the ATCC {{in one of}} the few Holden V8 powered VP Commodore's in {{the field}} for Bob Forbes Racing (most of the top Holden teams were using the 5.0 L Chevrolet V8). His first full ATCC ended with a disappointing 13th-place finish in the standings. He then went to 1993 Tooheys 1000 where he {{qualified}} the car 10th after <b>spinning</b> on <b>oil</b> during his Tooheys Top 10 runoff lap. Crompton complained on camera after his lap that there was no warning of oil until he got to The Chase (the fastest corner on a race track anywhere in Australia taken at some 280 km/h), but it was later found that it was in fact his car that had dropped the oil and other drivers reported it to be all around the 6.213 km (3.861 mi) circuit.|$|R
50|$|The rest of {{the drivers}} were there for qualifying, and Ferrari took the front row, with Lauda on pole from Regazzoni, and Hunt third in the Hesketh. There was chaos at the start when Mario Andretti in his Parnelli tapped the car of polesitter Lauda, sending it into the sister car of Regazzoni and {{knocking}} both Ferraris out of contention. Hunt gratefully took the lead, and Andretti, whose car was undamaged was second. Hunt led until he crashed after <b>spinning</b> on <b>oil</b> on the track, leaving Andretti leading from John Watson in the Surtees and Rolf Stommelen's Hill. Watson then had to pit with a vibration and the leader Andretti retired after a suspension failure sent him into the guardrail.

50|$|These {{properties}} {{are a result}} of the interplay of non-Newtonian properties (viscoelasticity, shear-thinning) with gravitational, viscous, and inertial effects in the jets. Free surface continuous jets of viscoelastic fluids are relevant in many engineering applications involving blood, paints, adhesives or foodstuff and industrial processes like fiber <b>spinning,</b> bottle-filling, <b>oil</b> drilling etc. In many of these processes, an understanding of the instabilities a jet undergoes due to changes in fluid parameters like Reynolds number or Deborah number is essential from process engineering point of view. With the advent of microfluidics, an understanding of the jetting properties of non-Newtonian fluids becomes essential from micro- to macro length scales, and from low to high Reynolds numbers7-9. Like other fluids, When considering viscoelastic flows, the velocity, pressure and stress must satisfy the mass and momentum equation, supplemented with a constitutive equation involving the velocity and stress.|$|R
