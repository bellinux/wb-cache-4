50|$|Following their {{investigation}} of the accident, the Norwegian Accident Investigation Board (AIBN) concluded {{that the cause of}} the accident was multiple fatigue cracks in the <b>splined</b> <b>sleeve</b> between the high-speed bendix shaft and the right-hand engine, which had caused damage to the engine overspeed protection system. The <b>splined</b> <b>sleeve</b> disintegrated, severing the high-speed shaft, which led to an overspeed of the right-hand power turbine which in turn burst, destroying the left-hand engine as well as to cutting control rods which made the helicopter uncontrollable.|$|E
50|$|The speed {{regulation}} {{was done by}} a steel bell crank, forked and carrying a U-shaped shoe to engage the grooved hub on the driving wheel at one end, and having the other end linked to the speed change and reversing lever. The wheel slid freely on the sleeve when {{moved away from the}} disk. All the speeds, from the highest to the lowest, could be done in either direction. The Lambert transmission always used side chains to the rear wheels and a balance gear connected to the <b>splined</b> <b>sleeve</b> on which the wheel slide and a steel shaft which supported the sleeve. The key feature of the Lambert automobile was the friction disk drive carried over from the Union automobile.|$|E
40|$|Tubing stiffens joint {{so that it}} can be alined with spline fitting; unsleeved joint would {{normally}} droop, making it difficult to attach to <b>splines.</b> <b>Sleeve</b> technique saves time and effort when assembling nonrigid parts by making special holding tools or fixtures unnecessary. Tubing also protects joint from dust and other contamination...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of consumption and emissions {{is a key}} fac- tor in modern vehicle design. The overall vehicle efficiency is pursued in several ways, including the {{reduction of}} consumption of the auxiliary devices (e. g. water pumps, oil pumps, vacuum pumps etc.). In this paper, using two different smart materials (i. e. magnetorheological fluids and shape memory alloys) a de- vice aimed at disengaging the vacuum pump was developed. The conceived device is composed of a magnetorheological (MR) clutch excited by permanent magnets coaxially manufac- tured with a sliding <b>spline</b> <b>sleeve</b> moved by shape memory alloys (SMA) springs. In the MR clutch, the magnet can move under {{the effect of a}} passive pneumatic system. The magnetic field in the fluid varies with the magnets displacement and as a result two steady positions are possible: the engaged clutch (ON) and the disengaged clutch (OFF). The torque in the ON configuration is high enough to drive the vacuum pump during normal operating conditions, whereas the low torque value in the OFF condition guarantees power saving up to 150 W. In particular operating conditions (i. e. at low environmen- tal temperatures) the torque necessary to start the vacuum pump may exceed the maximum transmissible torque of the MR clutch. For this reason a sliding <b>spline</b> <b>sleeve,</b> actuated by two SMA springs which counteract the force of two traditional springs was developed. A dummy plain sliding sleeve with SMA and con- ventional springs was numerically developed and tested. The fairly good agreement of the results confirmed the feasibility of the combined SMA/MR device...|$|R
40|$|Broaches {{are used}} for {{machining}} either internal or external surface (i. e. sizing of holds and cutting of serrations, straight or helical planes, gun rifling and key ways). In this work a broach cutting tool is design to perform internal splines of synch shuttle transmission for flange coupling. Broaching is a machining process in which a cutting tool, having multiple transverse cutting edges, is pushed or pulled through a hole or surface to remove metal by axial method. It is capable of production rates as much as 25 times faster than any traditional metal removing methods In this work a broach cutting tool is design to perform internal <b>splines</b> on <b>sleeve</b> main shaft. A sophisticated ANSYS 11 (FEM) package shall be {{used to analyze the}} displacements and stresses present in broach cutting tool. Further the solid model can be used to perform the finite element analysis which would help in knowing the characteristic of the broach tool under various cutting loads...|$|R
40|$|Some typical {{applications}} where scuffing {{may occur}} are gear teeth, piston rings and cylinder pairs, cams and followers, <b>splines,</b> <b>sleeve</b> bearings, {{and parts of}} swash and wobble plate compressors. Unlike other tribology-related failures, scuffing occurs very fast, without any warning, and usually leads to the complete destruction of the sliding pair. Practical experience with steel has helped to outline safe ranges of operation for some components. Very little, however, is known about aluminum, which {{is the second most}} commonly used engineering metal. The aim {{of this study is to}} obtain a better understanding scuffing and seizure of aluminum/steel contacts. The research includes an experimental study of scuffing of aluminum/steel contacts under dry sliding conditions, a study of the physics of the scuffing process, evaluation of various hypotheses for scuffmg, and modeling of scuffing. The experiments are conducted in a custom-designed tribometer, which provides accurate control of the environmental conditions. Special instrumentation, experimental procedures and software are developed as a part of the experimental program. These provide a reliable reproduction and identification of scuffing under laboratory conditions. The scuffing characteristics of five materials are obtained in air and refrigerant (R 134 a) environments. The effects of load, sliding velocity, mechanical strength, environmental temperature, specimen geometry, time, loading history, and type of environment are evaluated. The mechanisms leading to scuffing are studied by examination of surfaces, subsurfaces and wear debris of specimens in the process of scuffing. Quantitative measurements of subsurface plastic strain are also obtained. The theoretical part of the study includes the development of a finite element model for the contact of runned-in rough surfaces and several other models for subsurface stresses, temperatures, and strains. These models provide information about the local conditions in the subsurface Based on the experimental observations and the scuffing models a new hypothesis for scuffing is proposed. According to this hypothesis, scuffing involves initiation of cracks due to subsurface plastic deformation, propagation of these cracks leading to the removal of the existing protective surface layers, and finally cold welding due to adhesion between bare metal surfaces.
