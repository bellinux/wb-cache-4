25|$|The ancient Greek architects took a philosophic {{approach}} to the rules and proportions. The determining factor in the mathematics of any notable work of architecture was its ultimate appearance. The architects calculated for perspective, for the optical illusions that make edges of objects appear concave and {{for the fact that}} columns that are viewed against the sky look different from those adjacent that are viewed against a <b>shadowed</b> <b>wall.</b> Because of these factors, the architects adjusted the plans so that the major lines of any significant building are rarely straight.|$|R

30|$|Studies on OCR {{technology}} mainly {{focus on}} two aspects: character segmentation and character recognition. OCR in scenes with deep learning algorithm {{is one of}} the most important research areas in computer vision, and it has been studied for many years with different successful applications, although there are lots of research on text recognition in different scenarios, such as for printed document or manuscripts [9, 10]; however, the research on OCR technology for MSCs or industrial field application is rarely in the current literature. Character segmentation, which is the precondition of character recognition, heavily influences the accuracy of character recognition. Hence, digital imaging processing technology is used to enhance image quality to improve the accuracy and stability of character segmentation. In contrast, recognition algorithms based on different feature descriptors have been investigated in many studies. In stamping character segmentation, Li et al. first classifies the labeled image into several planes from the darkest to the brightest [11]. The printed text on the label is extracted from the binarized image of the darkest plane. Then, the block of printed text is determined using connect components analysis and removed. Finally, the pressed characters are extracted successfully. The character segmentation success rate of their algorithm can reach 93.4 %. The main reason for the segmentation failure is the uneven distribution of the image grayscale caused by deformation of the image. Gao et al. extracted two binary images of characters stamped on mechanical parts using a histogram of oriented gradient (HOG)-based local dynamic threshold algorithm and the Otsu method [12]. The two results were fused to obtain a more optimal binary image. Although the quality of the binarized image obtained by this algorithm is obviously improved, the results in this paper show that the result is still not satisfactory for images with strong background interference. Danijela et al. proposed a combination of a threshold adjustment control loop and image data merging methods [13]. Two-dimensional entropy feedback control was used to enhance image quality and improve the accuracy of character segmentation. In stamping character recognition, Li et al. first used a Gabor filter to directly extract the local stroke features of the convex character image in the horizontal, vertical, and left and right diagonal directions and constructed a Gabor feature space with rotation and scale invariance based on the total energy and invariance of the Gabor filter output to improve the accuracy rate of character recognition [14]. The accuracy rate of this algorithm can reach 97.83 % (based on a single character image after successful segmentation). In addition, some studies highlight the contrast between characters and backgrounds by obtaining the depth information of the characters. Quan et al. used sinusoidal grating projection and phase-shifting techniques to conduct the three-dimensional reconstruction of characters on a <b>shadow</b> <b>wall</b> and then obtain the depth information of stamped characters to complete the character structure and recognition [15]. However, this method needs to design complex system markings and requires a large amount of calculation, which is not ideal in the industrial field in practice. Chen et al. used the simplified photometric technology to obtain the normal vector of each point in the sample and then used a graph-based clustering method to segment imprinting characters [16]. The algorithm makes full use of the three-dimensional surface features of imprinting characters, but it has specific requirements regarding the material of object and cannot adapt to the different reflection models of different materials. Similar photometric stereo methods are also proposed by Ikehata et al. [17], Tsiotsios and Davison [18], et al., and they are useful complements to the existing techniques for background removal and are especially useful when there was no template available. However, for the task of OCR, the estimation of the surface topology is not the final goal, and it is not necessary to reconstruct the surface contour; similar image acquisition strategy needs to be studied.|$|E
