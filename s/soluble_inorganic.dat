40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to describe the}} leaching of major <b>soluble</b> <b>inorganics</b> (the sulphate and chloride salts of calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium) from processed oil shale sourced from the Rundle resource, Queensland, Australia. The model accounts for rapid dissolution of readily soluble salts, the formation of non-charged ion pairs in solution, cation exchange and slow dissolution/precipitation of calcium sulphate (anhydride/gypsum). Leachate results from an experiment involving irrigation of an initially dry column of processed shale are used to validate the model. A piston model is used to account for unsaturated water flow, and this is expressed in the water quality model by a moving bottom boundary condition. Tracer experiments show that a good basis for the leaching model is the classic convection-dispersion model. A moving node finite element method is used to obtain a numerical solution to this leaching model. The model provides a good description of the leaching of each inorganic species. Deviations between model predictions and experimental results are greatest at slower flowrates and for monovalent cations.

50|$|Phosphate solubilizing {{bacteria}} (PSB) are {{beneficial bacteria}} capable of solubilizing inorganic phosphorus from insoluble compounds. P-solubilization ability of rhizosphere microorganisms {{is considered to}} be one of the most important traits associated with plant phosphate nutrition. It is generally accepted that the mechanism of mineral phosphate solubilization by PSB strains is associated with the release of low molecular weight organic acids, through which their hydroxyl and carboxyl groups chelate the cations bound to phosphate, thereby converting it into soluble forms. PSB have been introduced to the Agricultural community as phosphate Biofertilizer. Phosphorus (P) is one of the major essential macronutrients for plants and is applied to soil in the form of phosphate fertilizers. However, a large portion of <b>soluble</b> <b>inorganic</b> phosphate which is applied to the soil as chemical fertilizer is immobilized rapidly and becomes unavailable to plants. Currently, the main purpose in managing soil phosphorus is to optimize crop production and minimize P loss from soils. PSB have attracted the attention of agriculturists as soil inoculums to improve the plant growth and yield. When PSB is used with rock phosphate, it can save about 50% of the crop requirement of phosphatic fertilizer. The use of PSB as inoculants increases P uptake by plants. Simple inoculation of seeds with PSB gives crop yield responses equivalent to 30 kg P2O5 /ha or 50 percent of the need for phosphatic fertilizers. Alternatively, PSB can be applied through fertigation or in hydroponic operations. Many different strains of these bacteria have been identified as PSB, including Pantoea agglomerans (P5), Microbacterium laevaniformans (P7) and Pseudomonas putida (P13) strains are highly efficient insoluble phosphate solubilizers. Recently, researchers at Colorado State University demonstrated that a consortia of four bacteria (sold commercially as Mammoth P and Bio-Fizz), synergistically solubilize phosphorus at a much faster rate than any single strain alone.|$|E
