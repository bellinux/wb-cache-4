50|$|<b>Stack</b> {{pointers}} may {{point to}} the origin of a <b>stack</b> or to a limited range of addresses either above or below the origin (depending on {{the direction in which}} the <b>stack</b> grows); however, the <b>stack</b> pointer cannot cross the origin of the <b>stack.</b> In other words, if the origin of the <b>stack</b> is at address 1000 and the <b>stack</b> grows downwards (towards addresses 999, 998, and so on), the <b>stack</b> pointer must never be incremented beyond 1000 (to 1001, 1002, etc.). If a pop operation on the <b>stack</b> causes the <b>stack</b> pointer to move past the origin of the <b>stack,</b> a <b>stack</b> underflow occurs. If a push operation causes the <b>stack</b> pointer to increment or decrement beyond the maximum extent of the <b>stack,</b> a <b>stack</b> overflow occurs.|$|R

50|$|When a {{function}} is called, a <b>stack</b> frame is created. A <b>stack</b> frame is built {{from the end}} of memory to the beginning; and each <b>stack</b> frame is placed {{on the top of the}} <b>stack,</b> closest to the beginning of memory. Thus, running off the end of a piece of data in a <b>stack</b> frame alters data previously entered into the <b>stack</b> frame; and running off the end of a <b>stack</b> frame places data into the previous <b>stack</b> frame. A typical <b>stack</b> frame may look as below, having a return address (RETA) placed first, followed by other control information (CTLI).|$|R
50|$|Pushing an item {{on to the}} <b>stack</b> {{adjusts the}} <b>stack</b> pointer {{by the size of}} the item (either decrementing or incrementing, {{depending}} on the direction in which the <b>stack</b> grows in memory), pointing it to the next cell, and copies the new top item to the <b>stack</b> area. Depending again on the exact implementation, at the end of a push operation, the <b>stack</b> pointer may point to the next unused location in the <b>stack,</b> or it may point to the topmost item in the <b>stack.</b> If the <b>stack</b> points to the current topmost item, the <b>stack</b> pointer will be updated before a new item is pushed onto the stack; if it points to the next available location in the <b>stack,</b> it will be updated after the new item is pushed onto the <b>stack.</b>|$|R

50|$|When <b>stack</b> {{frame sizes}} can differ, such as between {{different}} functions or between invocations {{of a particular}} function, popping a frame off the <b>stack</b> does not constitute a fixed decrement of the <b>stack</b> pointer. At function return, the <b>stack</b> pointer is instead restored to the frame pointer, {{the value of the}} <b>stack</b> pointer just before the function was called. Each <b>stack</b> frame contains a <b>stack</b> pointer {{to the top of the}} frame immediately below. The <b>stack</b> pointer is a mutable register shared between all invocations. A frame pointer of a given invocation of a function is a copy of the <b>stack</b> pointer as it was before the function was invoked.|$|R

This paper describes our work on extending Gforthâ€™s <b>stack</b> caching implementation to support more than one register in the canonical state, and presents timing results for the resulting Forth system. For single-representation <b>stack</b> caches, keeping just one <b>stack</b> item in registers is usually best, and provides speedups up to a factor of 2. 84 over the straight-forward <b>stack</b> representation. For <b>stack</b> caches with multiple <b>stack</b> representations, using the one-register representation as canonical representation is usually optimal, resulting in an overall speedup of up to a factor of 3. 80 (and up to a factor of 1. 53 over single-representation <b>stack</b> caching). ...|$|R

5|$|Certain {{effects of}} light only {{last for a}} few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera {{received}} attention {{for no more than}} a few minutes a day. Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues are evident in each painting, and in each work, color is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons <b>stacks</b> absorb the light from diverse parts of the color spectrum. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the <b>stacks</b> is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.|$|E
40|$|Parallel and T-shaped <b>stacking</b> {{interactions}} of the peptide plane with polar and ionizable amino acid side chains (including aspartic/glutamic acid, asparagine/glutamine, and arginine) are investigated using the quantum mechanical MP 2 and CCSD computational methods.

For certain complexes, the dispersion interaction also contributes considerably to <b>stacking.</b> In the gas phase, the <b>stacking</b> interaction of the charged system is stronger than that of the neutral system, and T-shaped <b>stacking</b> is generally more preferred than parallel <b>stacking,</b> with the <b>stacking</b> energy in the range of 4 to - 18 kcal/mol.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{experimental}} comparison of a pin <b>stack</b> to a conventional <b>stack</b> in a thermoacoustic prime mover. A thermoacoustic prime mover {{is a type}} of natural heat engine which converts a temperature gradient across a <b>stack</b> into acoustic energy. A pin <b>stack</b> uses wires which are arranged in a hexagonal array instead of the parallel or rolled plates of a conventional <b>stack.</b> The pin <b>stack</b> was constructed by by threading 75 micron constantan wire between the hot and cold heat exchangers 2312 times. Computer modeling with the program DeltaE predicts that a pin <b>stack</b> will significantly improve the efficiency of the prime mover. In the experiment the temperature gradient across the <b>stack</b> was supplied by submerging the cold end in liquid nitrogen while holding the hot end at ambient temperature. The experiment was conducted for both the pin <b>stack</b> and a conventional rolled <b>stack.</b> The pin <b>stack</b> produced 20 % higher acoustic pressures than the rolled <b>stack</b> and the efficiency was up to 31 % better. The pin <b>stack</b> went into onset at a 41 % lower mean pressure than the rolled <b>stack.</b> U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) autho...|$|R
40|$|G-quadruplexes {{constitute}} {{a class of}} nucleic acid structures defined by <b>stacked</b> guanine tetrads (or G-tetrads) with guanine bases from neighboring tet-rads <b>stacking</b> with one another within the G-tetrad core. Individual G-quadruplexes can also <b>stack</b> with one another at their G-tetrad interface leading to higher-order structures as observed in telomeric repeat-containing DNA and RNA. In this study, we investigate how guanine base <b>stacking</b> influences the stability of G-quadruplexes and their <b>stacked</b> higher-order structures. A structural survey of the Protein Data Bank is conducted to characterize ex-perimentally observed guanine base <b>stacking</b> geometries within the core of G-quadruplexes and at the interface between <b>stacked</b> G-quadruplex structures. We couple this survey with a systematic computational examination of <b>stacked</b> G-tetrad energy landscapes using quantum mechanical com-putations. Energy calculations of <b>stacked</b> G-tetrads reveal large energy differences of up to 12 kcal/mol between experimentally observed geometries at the interface of <b>stacked</b> G-quadruplexes. Energy land-scapes are also computed using an AMBERmolecu-lar mechanics description of <b>stacking</b> energy and are shown to agree quite well with quantum mech-anical calculated landscapes. Molecular dynamics simulations provide a structural explanation for the experimentally observed preference of parallel G-quadruplexes to <b>stack</b> in a 50 â€“ 50 manner based on different accessible tetrad <b>stacking</b> modes at the <b>stacking</b> interfaces of 50 â€“ 50 and 30 â€“ 30 <b>stacked</b> G-quadruplexes...|$|R
