40|$|Swine Industry Day 1973 {{is known}} as Swine Day, 1973 Interest in environmentally-controlled {{facilities}} for swine has been increasing recently. Farrowing in such a facility can be justified for producers who plan to be producing pork for some time. However, many producers, with good justification, prefer open-front buildings for finishing pigs. The growing and finishing unit at the Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station is an open-front building facing south, with all pen floors slotted and a liquid-manure, oxidation ditch beneath. It is two wings connected by a storage and service area. Each wing is a metal-sided, clear-span structure containing 16 pens, 6 x 15 ft with a 6 ft alley on the south side. The roof is insulated with an exposed, one-inch blanket faced with a plastic vapor barrier: outside walls have <b>sprayed-on</b> <b>insulation</b> approximately one inch thick...|$|E
40|$|A {{program was}} {{completed}} at the University of Dayton Research Institute in which polyimide and phenolic intumescent coatings were evaluated as supplemental thermal <b>insulation</b> for the <b>sprayed-on</b> foam <b>insulation</b> on the aft bulkhead {{of the space}} shuttle external tank. The purpose of the intumescent coating was to provide additional thermal protection during lift-off in order to replace the ablative heat resistant layer with a lighter weight material for increased payload in the shuttle...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{methodology}} {{for creating a}} simulated foam microstructure for use in forward simulations of wave equations to quantitatively analyze the expected scattering phenomenon primarily responsible for the attenuation of interrogating signals in <b>Sprayed-On</b> Foam <b>Insulation</b> (SOFI). Our approach builds off of the popular use of Voronoi Tessalations for crystal growth modeling by using the Laguerre variant (Apollonius Graph) applied to close-packed spheres. A fi lled-in random raindrop algorithm is used to generate the packing confi guration. Lastly, variation of diameter mean values is used to model knitlines, i. e., the interfaces between sprayed-on layers...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} a noncontact single-sided terahertz electromagnetic measurement and imaging method that simultaneously characterizes microstructural (egs. spatially-lateral density) and thickness variation in dielectric (insulating) materials. The method was demonstrated for two materials-Space Shuttle External Tank <b>sprayed-on</b> foam <b>insulation</b> and a silicon nitride ceramic. It {{is believed that}} this method {{can be used as}} an inspection method for current and future NASA thermal protection system and other dielectric material inspection applications, where microstructural and thickness variation require precision mapping. Scale-up to more complex shapes such as cylindrical structures and structures with beveled regions would appear to be feasible...|$|R
50|$|The Terahertz Density Thickness Imager is a {{nondestructive}} inspection method that employs terahertz energy for density and thickness mapping in dielectric, ceramic, and composite materials. This non-contact, single-sided terahertz electromagnetic measurement and imaging method characterizes micro-structure and thickness variation in dielectric (insulating) materials. This method was demonstrated for the Space Shuttle external tank <b>sprayed-on</b> foam <b>insulation</b> {{and has been}} designed for use as an inspection method for current and future NASA thermal protection systems and other dielectric material inspection applications where no contact {{can be made with}} the sample due to fragility and it is impractical to use ultrasonic methods.|$|R
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for testing the tensile strength and bonding strength of <b>sprayed-on</b> foam <b>insulation</b> attached to metal cryogenic fuel tanks is described. A circular cutter {{is used to}} cut the insulation down {{to the surface of}} the metal tank to form plugs of the insulation for testing in situ on the tank. The apparatus comprises an electromechanical pulling device powered by a belt battery pack. The pulling device comprises a motor driving a mechanical pulling structure comprising a horizontal shaft connected to two bell cracks which are connected to a central member. When the lower end of member is attached to a fitting, which in turn is bonded to a plug, a pulling force is exerted on the plug sufficient to rupture it. The force necessary to rupture the plug or pull it loose is displayed as a digital read-out...|$|R
40|$|Results that {{illustrate}} {{the use of}} a video-image-correlation-based displacement and strain measurement system to assess the effects of material nonuniformities on the behavior of the <b>sprayed-on</b> foam <b>insulation</b> (SOFI) used for the thermal protection system on the Space Shuttle External Tank are presented. Standard structural verification specimens for the SOFI material with and without cracks and subjected to mechanical or thermal loading conditions were tested. Measured full-field displacements and strains are presented for selected loading conditions to {{illustrate the}} behavior of the foam and the viability of the measurement technology. The results indicate that significant strain localization can occur in the foam because of material nonuniformities. In particular, elongated cells in the foam can interact with other geometric or material discontinuities in the foam and develop large-magnitude localized strain concentrations that likely initiate failures. Furthermore, some of the results suggest that continuum mechanics and linear elastic fracture mechanics might not adequately represent the physical behavior of the foam, and failure predictions based on homogeneous linear material models are likely to be inadequate...|$|R
40|$|After {{propellant}} {{was loaded}} into the external tank (ET), the November 5, 2010 launch of Space Shuttle mission STS- 133 was scrubbed due to a gaseous hydrogen leak located in a vent line near the ground umbilical and ET connection. Subsequent visual inspections identified cracks in the <b>sprayed-on</b> foam <b>insulation</b> in the forward end of the ET intertank segment, adjacent to the liquid oxygen (LOX) tank, as shown in Figure 1. These cracks necessitated repair of the foam due to debris concerns that violated launch constraints. As part of the repair process, the affected foam was removed to reveal cracks in the underlying external hat stiffeners on the intertank, as shown in Figure 2. Ultimately, five stiffeners were discovered to be cracked adjacent to the LOX tank. As the managing center for the ET Project, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) coordinated failure investigation and repair activities among multiple organizations, which included the ET prime contractor (Lockheed Martin Space Systems Michoud Operations), the Space Shuttle Program Office at the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC), the NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and the NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC). STS- 133 utilized the external tank designated as ET- 137. Many aspects of the investigation have been reported previously in Refs. 1 - 7, which focus on {{the root cause of}} the failures, the flight readiness rationale and the local analyses of the stringer failures and repair. This paper summarizes the global analyses that were conducted on ET- 137 as part of the NESC effort during the investigation, which was conducted primarily to determine if the repairs that were introduced to the stringers would alter the global response of the ET. In the process of the investigation, a new STAGS tabular input capability was developed to more easily introduce the aerodynamic pressure loads using a method that could easily be extended to incorporate finite element property data such as skin and stiffener thicknesses and beam cross-sectional properties...|$|R
40|$|The Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) {{contains}} the liquid H 2 fuel and liquid oxygen oxidizer and supplies them {{under pressure to}} the three space shuttle main engines (SSME) in the orbiter during lift-off and ascent. The ET thermal protection system consists of <b>sprayed-on</b> foam <b>insulation</b> and pre-molded ablator materials. The closed-cell foams are the external coating on the ET and are responsible for minimizing the amount of moisture that condenses out and freezes on the tank from the humid air in Florida while {{it is on the}} pad with cryogenic propellant awaiting launch. This effort was part of the overall drive to understand the behavior of these materials under use-conditions. There are four specially-engineered closed-cell foams used on the tank. The thermal expansion (contraction) of three of the polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foams were measured from - 423 F (the temperature of liquid hydrogen) to 125 F under atmospheric conditions and under vacuum. One of them, NCFI 24 - 124, is a mechanically-applied material and covers the main acreage of the tank, accounting for 77 percent of the total foam used. Another, BX- 265, is also a mechanically-applied and hand-sprayed material used on the tank's "closeout" areas. PDL 1034 is a hand-poured foam used for filling odd-shaped cavities in the tank, Measurements were made in triplicate in the three primary material directions {{in the case of the}} first two materials and the two primary material directions in the case of the last. Task 1 was developing the techniques for getting a uniform heating rate and minimizing axial and radial thermal gradients in the specimens. Temperature measurements were made at four locations in the specimens during this initial development phase of testing. Major challenges that were overcome include developing techniques for transferring the coolant, liquid helium (- 452 F), from its storage container to the test facility with a minimal transfer of heat to the coolant and control of the heating rate at the lowest temperatures...|$|R
40|$|When micrometeoroid or debris impacts {{occur on}} a space habitat, crew members {{need to be}} quickly {{informed}} of the likely extent of damage, and be directed to the impact location for possible repairs. This is especially important because the outer walls of pressurized volumes are often not easily accessible, blocked by racks or cabinets. The goal of the Habitat Particle Impact Monitoring System (HIMS) {{is to develop a}} fully automated, end-to-end particle impact detection system for crewed space exploration modules. The HIMS uses multiple passive, thin film piezo-polymer vibration sensors to detect impacts on a surface, and computer processing of the acoustical signals to characterize the impacts. Development and demonstration of the HIMS is proceeding in concert with NASA's Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU) Project. The HDU Project is designed to develop and test various technologies, configurations, and operational concepts for exploration habitats. This paper describes the HIMS development, initial testing, and HDU integration efforts. Initial tests of the system on the HDU were conducted at NASA s 2010 and 2011 Desert Research and Technologies Studies (Desert-RATS or D-RATS). The HDU lab module, as seen from above, has an open circular floorplan divided into eight wedge-shaped Segments. The side wall of the module [...] the surface used for this technology demonstration [...] is a hard fiberglass composite covered with a layer of <b>sprayed-on</b> foam <b>insulation.</b> Four sensor locations were assigned near the corners of a rectangular pattern on the wall of one segment of the HDU lab module. The flat, self-adhesive sensors were applied to the module during its initial outfitting. To study the influence of the wall s construction (thickness and materials), three sets of four sensors were installed at different layer depths: on the interior of the module s wall, on the exterior of the same wall, and on the exterior of the foam insulation. The signal produced when a vibration passes through a sensor is first sent through a pre-amplifier. The amplified signal then is sent to the data acquisition and data processing systems. The vibration data from the sensors are then processed and reduced to a form suitable for presentation to the crew...|$|R
