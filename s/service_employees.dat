5|$|A {{hospital}} {{had originally been}} installed at Alcatraz during its time as a military prison in the late 19th century. During its time as a federal penitentiary, it was located above the dining hall on the second floor. Hospital staff were U.S. Public Health <b>Service</b> <b>employees</b> assigned to the Federal Prison Service at Alcatraz. Doctors often lasted fewer than several days or months at Alcatraz, because few of them could tolerate the violent inmates who would often terrify them if they failed to be given certain drugs. Prisoners in ill health were often kept in the hospital, most famously, Stroud and Al Capone, who spent years in it.|$|E
5|$|A CBC investigation, {{intended}} to test {{access to information}} following Bill 29, discovered that some departments and agencies were refusing to release previously available details about how much public employees take home above their base salaries. When the media was briefed on Bill 29 the-then Deputy Minister of Justice, Donald Burrage, said that {{the provisions of the}} act which enabled the public to see bonuses offered to public <b>service</b> <b>employees</b> had not been changed. Minister Hutchings confirmed that only the base salary, or a salary range, plus a range of possible bonuses, are now available. However, he said {{that this was not a}} change due to Bill 29 and that the information on salaries is only voluntary.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 2015, the Culinary Craft Association (CCA), a union at the school, {{protested the}} CIA's {{outsourcing}} of jobs. Previously in 2015, {{the school had}} terminated 40 jobs in its dishwashing, stewarding, and cleaning departments, forcing them to reapply for jobs with cut wages and benefits. Later that year, CCA joined the <b>Service</b> <b>Employees</b> International Union (SEIU) Local 200United, members of which also protested in September 2015. The school was also demanding CCA cut ties with SEIU {{in order for the}} union workers to keep their jobs. On September 22, 2017, CCA held another protest; 17 of the 45 workers represented in the union are scheduled to be laid off and replaced by workers of LCS Facility Group. The workers are in grounds-keeping, recycling and painting at the school, where most of them have been employed for at least 20 years.|$|E

This was the only modern office building {{in the town of}} Harrisburg suitable for headquarters, and the forest has continued to occupy this building as Supervisor's offices. Expansion of the offices has continued since 1933, until today (June 1938), ten rooms on the third floor, and four rooms on the fourth floor, are leased by the Forest <b>Service.</b> <b>Employees</b> who were here during {{the early days of the}} forest tell of the chaos and confusion caused by the small space under lease, the incoming shipments of equipment and supplies, and the constant inflow of new personnel.|$|E
5|$|When the {{government}} seeks to burden a person's protected liberty interest or property interest, the Supreme Court has held that procedural due process requires that, at a minimum, {{the government}} provide the person notice, {{an opportunity to}} be heard at an oral hearing, and a decision by a neutral decision maker. For example, such process is due when a government agency seeks to terminate civil <b>service</b> <b>employees,</b> expel a student from public school, or cut off a welfare recipient's benefits. The Court has also ruled that the Due Process Clause requires judges to recuse themselves in cases where the judge has a conflict of interest. For example, in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. (2009), the Court ruled that a justice of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia had to recuse himself from a case involving a major contributor to his campaign for election to that court.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{crews of}} the government's Department of Social Security (DSS) visited {{locations}} throughout the region, receiving damage claims, requests for monetary aid, and filings for unemployment benefits. The Commonwealth pledged to provide $150million in relief {{over a three-year}} period to the government of Queensland in exchange for deregulation; however, its offer was initially rejected. Planes flew claims adjusters and other officials to Innisfail, establishing an insurance emergency service in the city hall, while the Insurance Council of Queensland deployed its special emergency <b>service</b> <b>employees</b> for the first time. As a result of severe damage, a disaster declaration for northern regions was issued by Queensland Government on 4February. The first $10million in aid from the state government, paid by the federal government, was supplied the same day. Meanwhile, the SES continued its cleanup efforts, removing debris and repairing structures. Looters took advantage of confusion in the days following the cyclone, striking residences throughout Innisfail. By the end of the day, 2200tarpaulins had been distributed; however, the previously-smooth relief efforts were impeded by thunderstorms in Cairns.|$|E

Unlike the DLR however, not every train will be accompanied by a service employee, and again unlike the DLR, <b>service</b> <b>employees</b> have no task in the actual operation of the train. Hence the grade of automation is mixed between GoA 3 - Driverless, and GoA 4 - Unattended Train Operation (UTO). Doors close automatically, supervised by light barriers and pressure-sensitive door edges. Only in the case of service disruptions will a service employee take over the task of driving the train. For this purpose, all <b>service</b> <b>employees</b> are fully trained drivers.|$|E
