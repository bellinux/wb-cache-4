5|$|In humans, sodium is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky; for Americans, most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, <b>sodium</b> <b>saccharin,</b> baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate. The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3grams per day, but the average person in the United States consumes 3.4grams per day. Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mmHg. It {{has been estimated that}} such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to between 9 and 17% fewer cases of hypertension.|$|E

Methods The synthetic sweeteners were extracted with water, separated on a reversed phase C 18 column using acetonitrile- 0. 02 mol/L ammonium acetate as mobile phase, and then detected by UPLC-MS/MS under multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Results The method showed a good linearity for all the analysts over the range of 10 ~ 600 μg/L with r≥ 0. 995. The detection limits of <b>sodium</b> cyclamate, <b>saccharin</b> <b>sodium</b> and acesulfame were 0. 8, 5. 0 μg/kg and 1. 0 μg/kg, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{the present}} study was to develop and {{evaluate}} orodispersible tablets of domperidone by direct compression method. Sodium starch glycolate (SCG), Kollidone CLSF and sodium bicarbonate were used as disintegrants to achieve the desired disintegration time required for orodispersible tablets. To mask the bitter taste of drug, impart sweetness and to offer a better feeling in mouth, <b>saccharin</b> <b>sodium,</b> aspartame, citric acid, menthol and lemon flavor were also added. Mannitol and lactose were used as sugar based multifunctional diluents. The prepared tablets were evaluated for their physical (hardness, friability, weight variation), organoleptic (taste, mouth-feel, color) and functional (disintegration time) properties and for the drug content. The excipients were used in various concentrations in order to optimize the desired properties. SCG and Kollidone CLSF, used in 5. 5 % and 4 % respectively, gave satisfactory disintegration time using BP instrument and within the mouth. Combination of <b>saccharin</b> <b>sodium</b> (1. 5 %) and aspartame (3 %) along with mannitol (40 %) and other excipients effectively masked the bitterness and provided satisfactory sweetness level.

METHODS All medicines administered to neonates during 1 day with individual prescription and demographic data were registered in a web-based point prevalence study. Excipients were identified from the Summaries of Product Characteristics. Determinants of EOI administration (geographical region, gestational age (GA), active pharmaceutical ingredient, unit level and hospital teaching status) were identified using multivariable logistical regression analysis. RESULTS Overall 89 neonatal units from 21 countries participated. Altogether 2095 prescriptions for 530 products administered to 726 neonates were recorded. EOI were found in 638 (31 %) prescriptions and were administered to 456 (63 %) neonates through {{a relatively small number}} of products (n= 142; 27 %). Parabens, found in 71 (13 %) products administered to 313 (43 %) neonates, were used most frequently. EOI administration varied by geographical region, GA and route of administration. Geographical region remained a significant determinant of the use of parabens, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol and <b>saccharin</b> <b>sodium</b> after adjustment for the potential covariates including anatomical therapeutic chemical class of the active ingredient. CONCLUSIONS European neonates receive a number of potentially harmful pharmaceutical excipients.
