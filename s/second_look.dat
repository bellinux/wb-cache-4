It applied eye tracking, stimulated recall interviews, and direct observation to investigate {{important aspects of}} gaze behavior in a faceted search interface: what components of the interface searchers looked at, for how long, and in what order. It yielded empirical data that will be useful for both practitioners (e. g., for improving search interface designs), and researchers (e. g., to inform models of search behavior). Results of the study show that participants spent about 50 <b>seconds</b> per task <b>looking</b> at (fixating on) the results, about 25 <b>seconds</b> <b>looking</b> at the facets, and only about 6 <b>seconds</b> <b>looking</b> at the query itself. These findings suggest that facets {{played an important role}} in the exploratory search process...|$|R

25|$|In 1861 {{the city}} of Kingston had {{considered}} buying the land around Bishop's Falls near Ashokan to dam and use as a reservoir. It dropped the idea quickly since the creek's waters were still fouled by tanning effluents. A quarter-century later it took a <b>second</b> <b>look,</b> and found the waters had returned to their pristine state with the tanneries gone. It eventually developed Cooper Lake (New York) on {{a tributary of the}} Saw Kill, for its water needs instead, after the privately owned Ramapo Water Company bought the rights.|$|E
25|$|Panahi {{made several}} short {{documentary}} films for Iranian television through the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting's Channel 2. His first short film, The Wounded Heads (Yarali Bashar), was {{a documentary about}} the illegal mourning tradition of head slashing in the Azerbaijan region of northern Iran. In the film, Panahi documented a mourning ceremony for the third Shi'ite Imam, Imam Hossein, where people hit their heads with knives until they bled. Panahi had to shoot in secret and the film was banned for several years. In 1988 Panahi filmed The <b>Second</b> <b>Look</b> (Negah-e Dovvom), a behind-the-scenes documentary short on the making of Kambuzia Partovi's film Golnar. It focuses on the puppet maker for Partovi's film and {{his relationship with his}} puppets. It was not released until 1993. In 1990 he worked as an assistant director on Partovi's film The Fish (1991).|$|E

25|$|The {{son of the}} rector of Dallinghoo, Walford {{was educated}} at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a middle- or lower-order batsman, {{though it is not}} known whether he batted right- or left-handed. His two {{first-class}} matches came within a fortnight of each other in May 1860. In the first, scores of 7 and 25 for the Cambridge University team against the Cambridge Town Club were enough for the university team to want to take a <b>second</b> <b>look</b> at him, and he was duly picked for the MCC team to play against the university, a frequent ploy in university cricket at the time, but then failed to score in his only innings. Although he played in minor matches for the Cambridge team across the rest of the 1860 season, he was not picked for the University Match against Oxford University and played no further first-class games.|$|E

[...] Although PALGN called the DMW system a [...] "handy tool", they also felt it was the game's weakest point. X-Play gave the game a 2/5, complaining about the unskippable cutscenes, poor dialogue, repetitive gameplay, and a weak plot.

500|$|The {{film has}} been {{considered}} a cult classic. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an average score of 71%, based on 17 critic reviews. The site's consensus reads: [...] "Killer Klowns from Outer Spaces title promises darkly goofy fun – {{and more often than}} not, the movie delivers." [...] Leonard Klady of The New York Times wrote that the film [...] "demonstrates both above-average technical skill and large dollops of imagination". Film critic Leonard Maltin initially declared the film a BOMB ("Strictly tenth-rate."), but gave the movie a <b>second</b> <b>look</b> after a few years; this time, Maltin awarded the picture two-and-a-half out of a possible four stars. In his second review, Maltin wrote [...] "Routinely plotted, but vividly designed, with cheeky humor...plays its premise to the hilt, all 'circus' bases touched".|$|E

The New York Times highlighted Heath's Grammy Award-nominated What If We album {{as one of}} the best Grammy nominees in Christian music that year, saying; [...] "Mr. Heath's sense of wonder is firmly intact — 'Give Me Your Eyes,' which is nominated for best gospel song, is a breezy statement of humble devotion." [...] The song was featured on USA Todays top ten [...] "pick of the week" [...] playlist in the beginning of March 2009; the magazine's editor and music critic Brian Mansfield said, [...] "Grammy and Dove Award nominations are attracting a <b>second</b> <b>look</b> for Heath's song about seeing life's big picture." [...] Jesus Freak Hideout's Matthew Watson said of Heath's future music efforts: [...] "it could be really outstanding if he sticks to more upbeat songs like 'Give Me Your Eyes'." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with a title screen of the song and Hamasaki's name. It then shows a boy looking towards the camera, until shifting to Hamasaki wearing a colorful outfit whilst surrounded by star-like shapes. The boy walks through the stars whilst Hamasaki sings the song; the <b>second</b> <b>look</b> is inspired by the artwork of [...] "To Be". He opens a case that holds a kaleidoscope and looks through it, seeing various versions of Hamasaki in different colored outfits and wigs singing the song. All these scenes start to re-appear {{throughout the rest of}} the song, and ends with a black and white image of Hamasaki, apparently cracked in the kaleidoscope, which then has the boy looking upset. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), a self-titled DVD (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016).|$|E

500|$|While filming The Deceivers in Rajasthan, India, in 1987, Brosnan's wife Harris became seriously ill. She {{was later}} {{diagnosed}} with ovarian cancer and died on 28 December 1991 at age 43. Brosnan struggled {{to cope with}} her cancer and death. [...] "When your partner gets cancer, then life changes.

500|$|Madonna also enlisted male models Brad Alphonso, Jon Kortajarena, Rob Evans, Sean O'Pry and Simon Nessman. In the video, Madonna {{sported a}} {{brassiere}} designed by Agent Provocateur. The singer's stilettos, which were custom-made by footwear designer Paola Bay, consisted of black silk embroidered with silver threading. [...] "She wanted them {{as high as}} possible {{and to be able}} to dance with them on," [...] stated Bay. [...] "We did three fittings to make sure they were like second skin." [...] Arianne Phillips, dress designer for the video, recalled that she had to create custom-made high-heeled stilettos for Kazaky, because of unavailability of shoes in their size. Artur Gaspar from the band recalled that [...] "By the end of the day on set, our feet were bleeding and we had blisters... But if Madonna can repeat the dancing for the 50th time, why can't we?" [...] Phillips explained that they had created three different looks for Madonna in the video. The first was called a [...] "super vixen" [...] look for which she created short tops that could be worn as brassiere. Hairstylist Andy Lecompte wanted to go for a 1960s style with it. The <b>second</b> <b>look</b> portrayed was called [...] "rockstar" [...] for which designer Michael Smith created T-shirts out of metal mesh, while Lecompte cut the singer's hair short, so that it would resemble her early look. The final look was called the [...] "platinum bombshell", and was inspired by Marilyn Monroe.|$|E
500|$|Billboard {{magazine}} called the song [...] "a Pussycat Dolls-inspired contempo jam, high on hooks and of-the-moment production. Well done, {{if in the}} most generic sense." [...] About.com's Bill Lamb gave the song 4/5 stars, saying that with [...] "Say It Right", [...] "many pop music fans are likely to take a <b>second</b> <b>look</b> at purchasing [...] ". He described the song as [...] "the foundation of Loose" [...] and [...] "a welcomed presence in the pop top 40". IGN Music calls the song [...] "...one of the brightest moments on the album" [...] and [...] "another throwback to the '80s" [...] which [...] "...lets loose with the most hypnotic chorus". Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered the song [...] "a dark meditative piece that would have fit on [...] previous records". The New York Times described the song as [...] "building a groove from hard drums and ghostly, multitracked voices, and Ms. Furtado sings a melancholy chorus she doesn't quite believe", comparing the coda, with music getting louder and then slowly fading, [...] "the way the best — and worst — nights out often do". Also, DJ Z's reviewed the song as [...] "the only single {{in the world to}} work at both a club in Manhattan, and on a safari through the natives land of (fill in the blank)." [...] The song received a nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards, losing to Amy Winehouse's [...] "Rehab".
