Treatments were laid out in complete randomized block design with seven treatments and three replications and include (1) fire of straw and <b>stubble,</b> <b>plow,</b> disc and furrower (2) gathering and transfer of straw and stubble out of farm, plow, disc and furrower, (3) Plow, disc and furrower (4) Stalk shredder, plow, disc and furrower, (5) Stalk shredder, plow, disc, 50 kg. ha- 1 urea and furrower (6) Stalk shredder, plow, disc, 100 kg. ha- 1 urea and furrower, (7) Stalk shredder, plow, disc, 50 kg. ha- 1 urea, 10 t. ha- 1 animal manure and furrower. The results showed that treatments had significant effect on nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous and protein of leaf, diameter and height of stem, ear yield, stem yield, leaf yield, total yield of corn, nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous, bulk density and of soil, wilting point, field capacity, available water. Maximum amount of nitrogen (2. 57 %) and phosphorous (0. 32 %) of leaf obtained from treatment of seven (Stalk shredder, plow, disc, 50 kg. ha- 1 urea, 10 t. ha- 1 animal manure and furrower) and the highest amount of potassium of leaf equal 1. 72 % obtained from treatment of seven (Stalk shredder, plow, disc, 50 kg. ha- 1 urea, 10 t. ha- 1 animal manure and furrower) and treatment of six (Stalk shredder, plow, disc, 100 kg. ha- 1 urea and furrower) with amount of equal 1. 60 %. Maximum total yield of corn equal 47. 65 t. ha- 1 obtained from treatment seven that laid at same group with treatment of six with yield of 46. 16 t. ha- 1 and had no significant difference together.

The two images, separated by three days, were both obtained at 30 -deg local angle of incidence, but with opposite azimuth viewing directions. The imagery was externally calibrated with respect to the radar backscattering coefficient sigma(0) via response to arrays of point and area-extended targets of known radar cross section. Three land-cover classes: (1) corn, (2) corn <b>stubble</b> and <b>plowed</b> bare soil, and (3) disked bare soil, soybeans, soybean stubble, alfalfa, and clover could be readily separated for either observation date on the basis of image tone alone. The dependence of sigma(0) on the surface roughness and canopy brightness inhibits the capability of SIR to globally estimate the near-surface soil moisture from the value of sigma(0) for single date observations, unless the surface roughness or canopy cover conditions are accounted for. However, within given ranges of these conditions, the sigma(0) was found to be highly correlated with the soil moisture...|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} spring staging {{areas of}} the midcontinent population of sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis) are along the Platte and North Platte rivers in south-central Nebraska. Most of these lands are privately owned and managed for corn and cattle production. Diurnal habitat use by radio-tagged cranes was primarily in cropland (55 %), native grassland (28 %), and tame hayland (15 %). Ninety-nine percent of the cropland use was in cornfields; 55 % as grazed stubble, 36 % as disced, cultivated, and <b>plowed</b> <b>stubble,</b> 7 % as ungrazed stubble, and 1 % unclassified. Grazed pastures accounted for 93 % of the grassland locations and mowed alfalfa fields 77 % of the tame hayland locations. Other habitats were seldom used.

Cranes usuallv roosted where the channel was at least 150 m wide and avoided stretches narrower than 50 m. Height of woody vegetation along shorelines and on islands influenced where cranes roosted when unobstructed channel width was less than 150 m; bridges or roads adjacent to the channel also reduced use by about half.

40|$|A field plot study {{involving}} comparative {{effects of}} soil fumigation on certain biological, chemical, and physical properties of <b>stubble</b> mulched and <b>plowed</b> soil was made. Stubble mulched plots had been subtilled nine years previous to treatment.

Soil samples were taken at the 0 - 1 and 1 - 6 inch depths, 17 and 72 days after treatment; refrigerated at 40 °F, and analyzed for total counts, fungi, denitrifiers, nematodes, nitrate-nitrogen, acid soluble phosphorus, pH, and percent soil aggregation. Soil fumigation did not affect stubble mulched plots significantly different than plowed plots. Nematodes were the most seriously affected by fumigants of the micro-organisms studied. Aerobic bacteria, actinomycetes, and denitrifiers were observed in significantly greater numbers in fumigated than nonfumigated plots. No significant difference was observed in the effectiveness of one fumigant over the other except for a reduction of nitrate-nitrogen by D-D and a decrease in percent soil aggregation by Ethylene dibromide. Stubble mulched plots contained significantly greater nematodes than plowed plots. Soil fumigation had little or no effect on the yield of wheat planted 18 days after fumigation.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 No-tillage {{winter wheat}} (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in a wheat-fallow {{cropping}} system has consistently produced lower grain yields than conventionally tilled soils in the semiarid Pacific Northwest. A 2 -year {{study was conducted}} in a long-term tillage trial at Moro, OR to determine factors responsible for differences in wheat growth and yield as affected by moldboard <b>plow,</b> <b>stubble</b> mulch, and no-tillage fallow method. Soil water, soil mineral N, plant N uptake, soil temperature, above-ground dry matter accumulation, and yield components were measured. The highest fallow efficiency during both years was achieved by stubble mulch tillage, followed by the plow and no-tillage systems. Accelerated water loss from no-tillage fallow occurred during the hot, dry summer due to uninterrupted capillary flow. The main yield limitations to no-tillage technology in this study were: (1) diminished seedzone water at planting time in the fall which resulted in reduced germination and stand establishment; (2) cooler spring soil temperatures which slowed crop development and dry matter accumulation, and; (3) production of fewer spikes per unit area. The second objective {{of this study was to}} determine if late season seedzone water loss from fallow could be reduced by altering the physical characteristics of the dust mulch. Loss of seedzone water appears to accelerate in late August and September because of increased diurnal heat flux. Compacting the soil surface with a roller in mid-August increased surface bulk density and volumetric water content to depths as great as 10 cm. Evaporative water loss from compacted plots, however, occurred at a faster rate than from control plots and, by mid-September, there were no differences in seedzone water content among treatments. Increased soil thermal conductivity appeared to be the reason for accelerated water loss in compacted treatments. Although water loss occurred at a faster rate in compacted treatments, compacting fallow soils with a roller immediately prior to fall seeding may increase winter wheat germination, emergence, and stand establishment during years of marginal seedzone water...|$|R

Various rates of spring fertilizers were applied as subplots to the fall fertilizer main plots. Whole plant samples were taken before harvest to determine the N uptake of each treatment. Samples were separated into grain and straw components, ground, and analyzed by a micro-Kjeldahl procedure for N content. Fall fertilization above the standard 23 kg N /ha applied at planting had varying effects on yield. In general, there was little or no response from the additional N during the first growing season after application. When additional fall N was applied on a field for two consecutive years, a yield response was usually realized. Yield increases from URS were equal to or better than yield increases from AMS. Sewage sludge generally yielded better than the fall check. Nitrogen uptake was not significantly influenced by the fall N {{in the first year}} of application, but did show some response where fall N was applied for two consecutive years. The additional fall N is not used with the same efficiency as spring applied N probably because the N is immobilized by the stubble, soil organic matter, and microorganisms. Further research is needed to determine the optimum rates and times of N application during the fall and/or winter. Future experiments need to compare the efficiency of N applied on the stubble compared with December, January, or February applications, which could be combined with herbicide application operations...|$|R
40|$|Sixteen {{acres of}} corn were grown {{on the grounds}} of the Iowa Experiment Station in 1889. The {{principal}} part of it was produced from the best ears of our last year’s crop of Learning corn, and the remainder consisted of Arleus and early Mastodon corn. It was grown on a black heavy soil, which was too wet formerly in wet seasons, to produce paying crops of anything, except grass; but last year it was tile-drained thoroughly. The greater part of the field had been used for many years as a pasture and the remainder, (perhaps five acres) was a part of an old field which had been used for different kinds of crops. It was well plowed early in September, 1888. Last spring, we ran over it twice with a disc harrow and once with a reversible harrow and then plowed it about eight inches deep. Then we ran over it again with a disc harrow and a reversible harrow and also with a heavy farm roller. It was planted May 2 d and 3 d, with a two horse planter in rows three feet and eight inches apart. From two to three grains were planted in each of the hills, which were thirty inches apart in the rows; but the entire field was thinned afterwards to two stalks in each hill. The field was harrowed twice with a Thomas smoothing harrow after the com came up; when it was divided into four lots, each of which was cultivated four times afterwards and hoed once. The south lot was cultivated each time with the Tower cultivator. The lot next to it was cultivated each time with the Eagle- Claw cultivator. The next or third lot, was cultivated with the riding Pearl cultivator, and the remainder of the field each time with the Albion Spring Tooth cultivator. The work of the Tower cultivator was excellent where oat <b>stubble</b> had been <b>plowed</b> under; but where old weeds or corn stalks were near the surface of the ground, it did not work well. The work of the Eagle-Claw cultivator was better than could be done by the walking or riding plows which are used in every neighborhood; because it pulverizes the surface of the ground better and leaves it level. But the Albion 248 Spring Tooth cultivator excels all other kinds which we have used, on all kinds of ground and in every respect. When our crop of corn was husked and measured during the latter part of October, the yield of the entire field proved to be eighty bushels per acre of sound shelled corn. I find from the reports of the Secretary of the Iowa Board -of Agriculture, that the average yield of corn in Iowa for the years 1883 - 8 inclusive, was 31 and 312 / 3 bushels per acre. The highest average yield per acre for a single year, was considered remarkable, being 411 / 4 bushels. When we compare such crops with our crop, we can not help asking, why are there such differences...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Verticillium dahliae Kleb. {{causes a}} wilt disease of peppermint. Attempts {{to control the}} disease by soil fumigation, crop rotation, flaming of <b>stubble,</b> and deep <b>plowing</b> have met with only limited success. Development of {{resistant}} varieties through conventional breeding procedures is difficult because commercial peppermint is male-sterile. Several strains of commercial peppermint that show field tolerance to Verticillium wilt have been developed by irradiating mint stolons, planting them under wilt conditions in the field, and selecting for resistance. The {{purposes of this study}} were (1) to test these irradiated strains of mint for their reaction to Verticillium wilt in Oregon (2) to compare these strains with commercial peppermint for their reaction to root penetration and subsequent infection by V. dahliae (3) to determine sites and mechanisms of resistance that might function in the resistant strains. Field experiments showed that the irradiated peppermint strains had a significantly lower incidence of wilt than did the non-irradiated commercial 'Mitcham'. Disease severity in individual resistant plants was sometimes as great as in susceptible plants. Therefore, disease incidence is more important than disease severity in selecting resistant strains. Dead stems of resistant strains had fewer microsclerotia of the fungus than did susceptible Mitcham. This shows that irradiated strains were less extensively invaded and would return less inoculum to the soil. Oil yield data from field plots showed that yield of the irradiated strains was not depressed in relation to Mitcham. Growth of Verticillium on stem pieces and sap-extract media of the resistant strains and on Mitcham control suggested that nutritional differences were not related to resistance and that inhibitory substances, possibly phenolic compounds, were present. The polyphenoloxidase (PPO) level of healthy, field grown plants fluctuated throughout the growing season and dropped to a low point at the time of flowering. The level of this enzyme {{did not seem to be}} associated directly with resistance but may be related to the types of phenolic compounds in the plants. The low level of PPO at the time of flowering suggested that plants with flowers might be more susceptible to wilt than non-flowering cuttings. Inoculation experiments showed, however, that differential resistance was maintained after plants had flowered. Flowering had no influence on wilt susceptibility and selection of a resistant variety could be made without regard to flowering. Resistant, moderately resistant, and susceptible strains of mint were invaded by conidia of Verticillium within 30 minutes after inoculation. Thus, resistance is not related to ability of the fungus to initially invade plants. Experiments using a cotton and mint isolate of V. dahliae showed that the cotton isolate is only weakly virulent to mint. The cotton isolate is, therefore, a different physiological strain of the fungus from the mint isolate. Roots of resistant, moderately resistant, and susceptible mint plants were penetrated nearly equally by V. dahliae, suggesting that resistance is not wholly dependent on resistance to root penetration. Resistance to Verticillium is present in stems as well as roots of mint plants. When the root system was bypassed by direct stem inoculation or by inoculation of cut shoots, resistance was maintained. Cross-protection was demonstrated when mint strains were inoculated with a cotton isolate of Verticillium and challenged one week later by a mint isolate. This suggests that active resistance mechanisms in peppermint are present and can be initiated by an avirulent strain of the fungus...|$|R
