40|$|Farmers are {{important}} stakeholders to be enrolled in national {{efforts to control}} and eliminate endemic livestock diseases by state veterinary authorities. Their co-operation (or otherwise) has significant influence {{on the success of}} <b>statutory</b> <b>disease</b> control efforts, and when accomplishment does not meet aspiration, farmers may be blamed by the state for perceived failures. Approaching disease control within a political ecology framework and using a qualitative social science investigation of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in Northern Ireland as a case study, this empirical paper explores the rationales and sensibilities of cattle farmers and the agricultural political economy and regulatory framework within which they operate in this region of the United Kingdom. This is important for understanding the farming context within which bTB is located, and this context is a feature of the disease landscape which has been under-developed in the bTB literature to date. Examining the premise that farmers are part of the problem of bTB, and a link in the chain of explanation as to why the disease has not yet been eliminated from the region, the paper will trace what everyday life is like for farmers living with multiple uncertainties and indeterminacies in their farming presents and futures. bTB as a disease is but one important influence on their farming lives – there are competing others which attract their attention and employ their resources, often pushing bTB down the list of priorities, despite its substantial cost to the economy. It will also demonstrate that farmers are embedded within wider structures, particularly global markets and European Union regulatory regimes, which profoundly condition and shape their actions, often elucidating resistance and a perceived loss of autonomy. A political ecology approach to investigating the complex multidimensional problems of First World agriculture, such as the effective control of endemic livestock disease in intensive production systems, is recommended if holistic interpretations and workable solutions are to be found and implemented...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to motivate health {{professionals}} to avoid missed opportunities of vaccination against tetanus. In the North of Portugal, 210 cases of tetanus were reported between 1993 and 2002. Data for this study was collected from the computerised records of <b>statutory</b> reportable <b>diseases</b> (1993 - 2002) and written reports from local health authorities (2000 - 2002). Most cases occurred between 55 and 84 years of age. Above the age of 65, females were the most affected (73. 7 %). All 17 cases (2000 - 2002) received hospital care. Two deaths were reported. Type and site of injuries were analogous to those already described in the literature. None of the patients had been adequately vaccinated. Almost all cases had attended health services in the 10 previous years. In order to eliminate tetanus, all contacts with health professionals should be an opportunity to check vaccination status and immunise against tetanus as recommended.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to provide {{epidemiological}} evidence useful to Portuguese health services dealing with prevention and treatment of malaria. Two sources of data were used: the computer database of <b>statutory</b> notifiable <b>diseases</b> and the reports of cases studied by local health authorities. The 140 cases of malaria reported between 1993 and 2002 in the North of Portugal are described. For the 26 available reports of cases occurred between 2000 and 2002 additional variables are described. The incidence rates of malaria, estimated for the period 1993 - 2002, respectively for Portugal and its Northern Region, were 0, 74 and 0, 45 per 100, 000 persons-year. Incidence was stable across the studied period. Most cases were males aged 15 to 64. Most cases with laboratory confirmation were due to Plasmodium falciparum. Clinical picture, travelling details and preventive measures, namely chemoprophylaxis, were also described. All cases were imported, mostly from Portuguese speaking African countries. The usefulness of reporting cases of malaria and conducting the respective study was discussed.

40|$|In one general {{practice}} over a six-week period three patients with atypical pneumonia were shown serologically to have psittacosis. All three patients {{had been exposed}} to the same flock of ducks but veterinary investigation three months after the first case had been reported did not show the ducks to be infected. However, in a retrospective review of laboratory-diagnosed psittacosis, a likely source of infection was found in 11 out of 24 cases and in most of these full medicoveterinary investigation would have been warranted. Early diagnosis, reporting quickly to the medical officer for environmental health and early liaison with the divisional veterinary officer are essential prerequisites if psittacosis is to be controlled. If psittacosis were made a <b>statutory</b> notifiable <b>disease</b> this would encourage a more energetic approach to its control. The proposed cutbacks in the veterinary investigation service will make full investigations more difficult...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor a few years, {{a series}} of {{traditionally}} tropical mosquito-borne diseases, such as chikungunya fever and dengue, have posed challenges to national public health authorities in the European region. Other diseases have re-emerged, e. g. malaria in Greece, or spread to other countries, e. g. West Nile fever. These diseases are reportable within the European Union (EU), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control collects information in various ways to provide EU member states with topical assessments of disease threats, risks and trends for prompt and appropriate public health action. Using disease-specific expert networks, the European Surveillance System (TESSy) collects standardized comparable information on all <b>statutory</b> communicable <b>diseases</b> in a database. In addition, the event-based surveillance aims to detect potential public health threats early, and to allow timely response and support to blood deferral decisions for pathogens that can be transmitted through blood donation. Laboratory capacity for early detection is implemented through external quality assessments. Other activities include the development of guidelines for the surveillance of mosquito vectors, {{and the production of}} regularly updated maps on the currently known occurrence of mosquito vector species...|$|R
40|$|Foodborne {{diseases}} still {{represent an}} important global public health issue, including Europe and Italy, which endangers {{the health of}} the population and leads to socio-economic costs and a threat to the market trend. In developed countries it is estimated that up to one third of the population are affected by microbiological foodborne diseases each year. In these countries, it has been observed that traditional infectious foodborne diseases have decreased while re-emerging and emerging pathogens like Escherichia coli O 157, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, Norovirus and Hepatitis A virus have increased. In 2004, in Italy the incidence for Listeriosis was 0. 06 per 100, 000 population and is included among the <b>statutory</b> notifiable <b>diseases.</b> E. coli O 157 :H 7 is not subject to statutory notification in Italy; however, a voluntary national surveillance system for HUS in paediatric patients and for VTEC, has lead to the notification of 429 paediatric HUS cases and 344 clinical cases of VTEC from 1988 to 2004. Data on campylobacteriosis are available thanks to the voluntary notifications received from the Enternet Laboratories: 582 cases were isolated from human clinical specimens in 2004. Furthermore, data from a specific surveillance system for acute viral hepatitis (SEIEVA) shows that the incidence of reported cases in Italy is declining. The necessity to alert the authorities responsible for epidemiological surveillance nationally remains paramount. Communication as well as educational campaigns aimed at different target groups, for example consumers, will {{play an important role in}} the prevention of foodborne diseases...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectivesWe {{compared}} the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics of enterovirus 71 (EV 71) cases {{recorded in the}} epidemic year of 2008 {{with those of the}} past decade. MethodsWe estimated the annual incidence rates in the general population and in different age groups. We reviewed the clinical and epidemiological information of the cases. The complication and case fatality rates (CFR) were compared with the corresponding average rates for the period 1998 – 2007. The molecular strains of EV 71 isolates were determined. ResultsThe estimated annual incidence was 1. 4 / 100 000 in the general population, with the highest incidence (27. 9 / 100 000) reported among children aged under 5 years. The seasonal peak occurred from May to July. The majority (92. 9 %) presented with hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD; 90. 8 %) or herpangina, and 11. 2 % had complications including meningitis or encephalitis (6. 1 %), pneumonia (3. 1 %), acute flaccid paralysis (1. 0 %), and shock (1. 0 %). The CFR was 1. 0 %. Nearly half (45. 9 %) of school-aged cases had concurrent HFMD outbreaks at their schools/institutions. There was no statistically significant difference in the complications rate and CFR when compared to those of the past decade. Molecular analysis showed that the majority were genogroup C 4 strains, similar to the past circulating strains. ConclusionsThe cyclical high activity has had significant public health and social implications. To strengthen public health surveillance and control, EV 71 infection was made a <b>statutory</b> notifiable <b>disease</b> in 2009...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Surveillance data {{allow for}} analysis, {{providing}} {{public health officials}} and policy-makers with a basis for long-term priorities and timely information on possible outbreaks for rapid response (data for action). In this article we describe the considerations and technology behind a newly introduced public web tool in Sweden for easy retrieval of county and national surveillance data on communicable diseases. Methods The web service was designed to automatically present updated surveillance statistics of some 50 <b>statutory</b> notifiable <b>diseases</b> notified to the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control (SMI). The surveillance data is based on clinical notifications from the physician having treated the patient and laboratory notifications, merged into cases using a unique personal identification number issued to all Swedish residents. The web service use notification data from 1997 onwards, stored in a relational database at the SMI. Results The web service presents surveillance data to the user in various ways; tabulated data containing yearly and monthly disease data per county, age and sex distribution, interactive maps illustrating {{the total number of}} cases and the incidence per county and time period, graphs showing the total number of cases per week and graphs illustrating trends in the disease data. The system design encompasses the database (storing the data), the web server (holding the web service) and an in-the-middle computer (to ensure good security standards). Conclusions The web service has provided the health community, the media, and the public with easy access to both timely and detailed surveillance data presented in various forms. Since it was introduced in May 2003, the system has been accessed more than 1, 000, 000 times, by more than 10, 000 different viewers (over 12. 600 unique IP-numbers). </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{infection}} is common among prisoners, particularly {{those with a}} history of injecting drug use (IDU). Incarcerated people who inject drugs frequently report high-risk injecting practices both in prison and in the community. In spite of rising morbidity and mortality, utilisation of HCV-related services in Australia has been persistently low. This study aimed to describe the incidence, prevalence and correlates of HCV seropositivity in a large cohort of prisoners who have injected drugs, and to identify correlates of receiving confirmation of active infection. METHODS: Data-linkage to a State-wide <b>statutory</b> notifiable <b>diseases</b> surveillance system was used to investigate the incidence of notified HCV seropositivity, seroconversion and confirmed HCV infection in a cohort of 735 prisoners {{with a history of}} IDU, over 14 years of follow up. Hepatitis C test results from prison medical records were used to identify correlates of testing positive in prison. RESULTS: The crude incidence of HCV notification was 5. 1 cases per 100 person-years. By the end of follow up, 55. 1 % of the cohort had been the subject of a HCV-related notification, and 47. 4 % of those tested in prison were HCV seropositive. In multivariable analyses, injecting in prison was strongly associated with HCV seropositivity, as was opioid use compared to injection of other drugs. The rate of reported diagnostic confirmation among those with notified infections was very low, at 6. 6 confirmations per 100 seropositive participants per year. CONCLUSIONS: Injecting drugs in prison was strongly associated with HCV seropositivity, highlighting the need for increased provision of services to mitigate the risk of transmission within prisons. Once identified as seropositive through screening, people with a history of IDU and incarceration may not be promptly receiving diagnostic services, which are necessary if they are to access treatment. Improving access to HCV-related services will be of particular importance in the coming years, as HCV-related morbidity and mortality is increasing, and next generation therapies are becoming more widely available.
