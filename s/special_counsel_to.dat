25|$|President Jimmy Carter {{nominated}} Truesdale to be a Member of the NLRB on September 26, 1977, to {{fill the}} unexpired term of Peter D. Walther (who had resigned).

Walther and NLRB chair John H. Fanning were advocates of Truesdale, however. Employer groups felt Truesdale was somewhat liberal but would help push Fanning to adopt a more moderate course. Carter, not wishing to begin a political fight over {{what was perceived as}} a minor appointment, nominated Truesdale. The United States Senate confirmed him, and he served on the board from October 25, 1977, to August 27, 1980. Truesdale was succeeded as executive secretary by William Lubbers in 1979.|$|E

Chotiner served as liaison between the White House and Republican organizations in 31 states. Chotiner taught at a March 1970 seminar for Young Republican leaders where he suggested that the Republican running against Senator Edward Kennedy mention the Chappaquiddick incident at every opportunity, while insisting that it was not an issue in the campaign.
