Data sources: The MEDLINE, LILACS, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched. reference lists, abstracts of conference proceedings and scientific meetings were hand searched. METHODS: Study selection: Fifteen articles that specifically addressed the stated purpose were selected. Data extraction: Yield of <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> and fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage were analyzed using explicit methodologic to evaluate the quality of clinical trials. RESULTS: <b>Sputum</b> <b>induction</b> demonstrated 55. 5 % sensitivity and 98. 6 % specificity to Pneumocystis pneumonia. Sensitivity of <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> was significantly higher with immunofluorescence than with cytochemical staining (67. 1 versus 43. 1 %). <b>Sputum</b> <b>induction</b> for diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia demonstrated 60 % sensitivity, 40 % specificity, 80 % positive predictive value, 20 % negative predictive value and 56 % accuracy.

40|$|Introduction Bronchial hyper-responsiveness {{is usually}} {{measured}} with direct stimuli such as methacholine (MCh) or histamine. Adenosine 5 '-monophosphate (AMP), which acts indirectly via the secondary release of mediators, is another stimulus to measure bronchial hyper-responsiveness. Aim To investigate whether provocation with inhaled AMP itself initiates an inflammatory response {{resulting in an}} influx of eosinophils into the airway lumen. Methods We have included 21 non-smoking atopic asthmatic subjects (mean FEV 1 101 % predicted, mean age 34 years). Each subject performed three <b>sputum</b> <b>inductions</b> on different days, at least seven days apart: one without previous provocation, one hour after PC 20 methacholine, and one hour after PC 20 AMP.

The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the reproducibility of inflammatory phenotype over time in patients with asthma. In 66 adults asthma was categorized as steroid-naïve (SN, n= 17), mild to moderate (MMA, n= 33), and refractory treated with oral corticosteroids (RA, n= 16). Clinical assessment, skin prick testing, spirometry, and two <b>sputum</b> <b>inductions</b> in 4 – 6 -week interval were done. Inflammatory phenotypes were classified as eosinophilic (EA), consisting of eosinophilic and mixed granulocytic phenotypes, and noneosinophilic (NEA) consisting of paucigranulocytic and neutrophilic phenotypes. During study asthma treatment remained constant. In SN group 25 % of patients changed phenotype from EA to NEA and 44 % changed phenotype from NEA to EA. In MMA group 26 % of patients changed phenotype from EA to NEA and 50 % changed phenotype from NEA to EA. In 29 % of RA patients inflammatory phenotype changed from EA to NEA and in 22 % it changed from NEA to EA.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the yield, feasibility and safety of <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> for the diagnosis of TB in children in a primary health care facility. DESIGN: A prospective study in a primary health care clinic in South Africa from April 2007 to June 2009. Consecutive children with clinically suspected PTB, with a household adult PTB contact or human immunodefi ciency virus infected with respiratory symptoms were enrolled.

40|$|The aim of <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> is {{to collect}} an adeguate sample of lower airway {{secretions}} {{in patients who}} {{are not able to}} produce sputum spontaneously. <b>Sputum</b> <b>induction</b> requires a high degree of patient cooperation and is best conducted in a quiet, secluded area to minimize embarrassment for the patient.

Infection control procedures for the protection of personnel and patients must be carried out according to the local anti-infection policy, which sometimes includes purpose-built chambers. The technique of <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> has been standardized to enable comparison between researchers and to ensure adequate reproducibility of the technique. Frequent repetition of <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> can itself lead to airway inflammation, resulting in a change in cell populations obtained by subsequent inductions.

40|$|Since the 1980 s, <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> by {{inhalation}} of hypertonic saline {{has been successfully}} used for diagnosing Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients infected with HIV. In recent years, <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> and its subsequent processing has been refined as a noninvasive research tool providing important information about inflammatory events in the lower airways, {{and it has been}} used for studying various illnesses. In asthma, one application is to use sputum inflammatory indices to increase our understanding of complex relationships between inflammatory cells, mediators, and cytokine mechanisms.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Longitudinal {{trials have}} {{suggested}} that asthma control {{may be influenced by}} fluctuations in eosinophilic inflammation. This association has however never been confirmed in daily practice. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between asthma control and sputum eosinophils in clinical practice. METHODS: A retrospective longitudinal study was conducted on 187 patients with asthma with at least 2 successful <b>sputum</b> <b>inductions</b> at our Asthma Clinic. Linear mixed models were used to assess the relationship between asthma control and individual changes in sputum eosinophils. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were constructed to define minimal important differences (MIDs) of sputum eosinophils associated with a change of at least 0. 5 in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score. Then, a validation cohort of 79 patients with asthma was recruited to reassess this relationship and the accuracy of the MID values. RESULTS: A multivariate analysis showed that asthma control was independently associated with individual fluctuations in sputum eosinophil count (P <. 001). In patients with intermittent/persistently eosinophilic asthma, we calculated a minimal important decrease of 4. 3 % in the percentage of sputum eosinophils (area under the curve [AUC], 0. 69; P <. 001) or 3. 4 -fold (AUC, 0. 65; P =. 003) for a significant improvement in asthma control and a minimal important increase of 3. 5 % (AUC, 0. 67; P =. 004) or 1. 8 -fold (AUC, 0. 63; P =. 02) for a significant worsening in asthma control.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Patients with {{seasonal}} {{allergic rhinitis}} may develop bronchial hyperresponsiveness during the active disease period. Eosinophil activation may {{occur in the}} bronchial mucosa and may be reflected by increased sputum levels of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), especially when ECP binding proteins such as α 2 -macroglobulin pass through the lamina propria and across the epithelium into the airway lumen. A study was therefore undertaken to determine histamine airway responsiveness (FEV 1) and bronchovascular responsiveness (exudation of α 2 -macroglobulin) to histamine in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis, and to explore whether sputum ECP levels are increased {{by the use of}} induced exudation followed by induced sputum.  METHOD—Eleven patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were examined before and during a birch pollen season. Sputum was induced by inhalation of 4. 5 % saline twice before and twice during the pollen season. Histamine inhalations were given before the second of each pair of <b>sputum</b> <b>inductions</b> at increasing concentrations until FEV 1 was reduced by 20 %. Sputum levels of α 2 -macroglobulin and ECP were determined as indices of bronchial exudation of plasma and activation of bronchial eosinophils, respectively.  RESULTS—Bronchomotor responsiveness increased during the pollen season (median difference in the reduction of FEV 1 9 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) - 3 to 26)) but histamine induced exudation of plasma was not increased. Baseline sputum levels of α 2 -macroglobulin and ECP did not increase. Histamine induced exudation of α 2 -macroglobulin was associated with increased sputum levels of ECP exclusively during the pollen season (median difference 8. 2 ng/ml (95 % CI 0. 4 to 562. 0)).  CONCLUSION—Bronchial hyperresponsiveness in seasonal allergic rhinitis may not be associated with bronchovascular exudative hyperresponsiveness. Sputum levels of ECP were increased only during the season, and only after induced exudation (potentially moving ECP to the mucosal surface). It is suggested that the combined method of induced exudation and induced sputum may significantly improve the yield of some markers of inflammation in sputum samples. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{suggested}} a pathogenetic role for airway inflammation in the induction of both chronic sputum production and chronic airflow obstruction in smokers. It is therefore important to characterise and quantify inflammatory changes in the assessment of subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Assessment of inflammation may be achieved by different means including invasive methods such as bronchial biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or examination of surgical specimens and non-invasive methods such as spontaneous or induced <b>sputum.</b> The <b>induction</b> of <b>sputum</b> by inhalation of hypertonic saline is a safe, reliable, and relatively non-invasive method in COPD, provided the technique is performed in a standardised way and measures are used to prevent adverse reactions. Induced sputum differs from spontaneous sputum by having a higher number of viable cells and less squamous cell contamination. There are no differences between spontaneous and induced samples from patients with COPD or asthma in the total and differential cell counts, but there is poor agreement in the fluid phase components. Bronchial biopsies and BAL can be performed in COPD for investigative use according to the published recommendations. When the different methods of assessing airway inflammation are compared in the same subjects, a different profile of inflammatory cells is obtained depending on the compartment of the lung examined by each techniquethat is, the lumen of the central airways using sputum analysis, the airway wall using bronchial biopsies, and the peripheral airways using BAL. By combining these techniques, integrated and comprehensive information on cell traffic and inflammatory processes in COPD at different levels of the airway can be obtained. Analysis of induced or spontaneous sputum has contributed to the identification of smokers susceptible to developing COPD, to the characterisation of the inflammatory process during exacerbations, and to the effects of intervention with anti-inflammatory drugs or by smoking cessation...|$|R

To date, the identification of sputum eosinophilia has the greatest clinical value as this predicts a favorable response to corticosteroids and can therefore guide treatment.

Currently, no other noninvasive measure of airway inflammation has demonstrated a benefit in reducing exacerbations. The value of <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> and analysis is not restricted to the recognition of sputum eosinophilia but also may be used to direct novel antineutrophilic therapies.

Methods: Twenty patients with moderate to severe asthma underwent <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> by inhaling saline 4. 5 % (or 0. 9 % if post-bronchodilation forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) < 65 % predicted) for 10 minutes according to two protocols given 1 week apart in random order. At visit A the patients received 400 mg salbutamol administered through a pMDI + spacer 20 minutes before induction while at visit B the premedication was supplemented by 1500 mg nebulised salbutamol inhaled throughout the induction procedure. Both the investigator and the patients were blind to the nebulised solution used. FEV 1 was recorded during <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> at 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes.

For sputum scarce individuals we assessed the value of the string test and induced sputum for TB diagnosis. The presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in the sputum of 107 HIV-positive patients was evaluated by ZN, LJ, and MODS. Gastric secretion samples obtained by the string test were evaluated by MODS in 102 patients. Results: The TB-HIV co-infection rate of HIV patients with respiratory symptoms by sputum sample was 45 % (48 / 107); 46 / 48 (96 %) were positive by MODS, 38 / 48 (79 %) by LJ, and 30 / 48 (63 %) by ZN.

The reproducibility of measurements, calculated by the intra-class correlation coefficient, was relatively high for all indices measured (0 · 4 – 0 · 95) {{with the exception of the}} proportion of lymphocytes (0 · 15) and epithelial cells (0 · 3). The ICC for symptom scores and the CRQ domains ranged between 0 · 87 and 0 · 96.

40|$|AbstractInduced sputum {{differential}} cell counts {{have been}} advocated {{as a method}} of non-invasively assessing airway inflammation in asthma and other airway diseases. Since <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> usually involves delivering hypertonic saline via a high output ultrasonic nebulizer there have been concerns about its safety in asthma. There are relatively little data on the effects of <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> in large numbers of patients. We have examined the success rate and effect of <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> on forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV 1) in 100 inductions performed on 79 patients using a low output nebulizer. Thirty-seven patients had asthma, 29 had miscellaneous conditions (mainly chronic cough) and 13 were subjects without respiratory symptoms. Sputum was induced 10 min after 200 μg of inhaled salbutamol by sequential 5 -min inhalations of 3, 4 and 5 % saline delivered via a Fisoneb ultrasonic nebulizer and FEV 1 was measured after each inhalation. <b>Sputum</b> <b>induction</b> resulted in a sample suitable for analysis in 92 % of asthmatics, 90 % of those with miscellaneous conditions and 100 % of normal subjects. The mean (sem) maximum per cent fall in FEV 1 was 5 · 4 % (0 · 1), 4 · 3 % (1 · 0) and 2 · 6 % (1 · 1) in subjects with asthma, miscellaneous conditions and in asymptomatic subjects respectively. Only 13 inductions resulted in a> 10 % fall in FEV 1, and only three of these resulted in a> 20 % fall. The maximum per cent fall in FEV 1 did not correlate with baseline FEV 1 % predicted (r= − 0 · 17), the log sputum eosinophil count (r= − 0 · 12), or the methacholine PC 20 (r= − 0 · 14). We conclude that <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> using a relatively low output ultrasonic nebulizer with premedication with salbutamol is successful and safe in the majority of patients with asthma and other airway conditions...|$|E

40|$|<b>Sputum</b> <b>induction</b> for the {{diagnosis}} of Pneumocystis pneu-monia (PCP) is widely used for patients with acquired im-munodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), but its utility for patients with other forms of immunocompromise is less well defined. Immunocompromised patients with PCP {{who do not have}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have a lower burden of organisms, and <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> may conse-quently have lower diagnostic yield in these patients. How-ever, this retrospective review of the experience at a tertiary referral center suggests that <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> has clinical utility for diagnosing PCP in immunocompromised patients without HIV infection. Patients with AIDS and other forms of immunocompromise are at risk of developing Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Be-cause there is no means to culture Pneumocystis jiroveci, di-agnosis of PCP depends on microscopic visualization of char-acteristic morphologic forms in samples recovered from a clinically relevant site. Before the AIDS era, PCP was diagnosed by open-lung biopsy or at autopsy. With the increasing number of PCP cases in the 1980 s, examination of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens became the preferred diagnostic procedure and was found to have a sensitivity approaching that of tissue-based diagnosis [1...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—Although <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> {{is used as}} a {{technique}} to investigate lower airway inflammation in asthmatic subjects, advantages over spontaneous sputum in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have not been investigated.  METHODS—Samples of spontaneous sputum and sputum induced with 3 % hypertonic saline for 14 minutes were collected from 27 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who usually produced spontaneous sputum. Spirometric indices and oxygen saturation (SaO 2) were measured at seven minute intervals. The spontaneous, seven and 14 minute sputum samples were analysed for total and differential cell counts, cell viability, and interleukin 8 levels.  RESULTS—Analysis of the sputum revealed that median cell viability was higher in the seven minute (62. 8 %; p = 0. 004) and 14 minute (65 %; p = 0. 001) induced sputum samples than in spontaneous sputum (41. 2 %). There {{was no significant difference in}} total and differential cell counts or in interleukin 8 levels between spontaneous and induced sputum. During the <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> procedure the mean (SD) fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) was 0. 098 (0. 111) l (p < 0. 001) and in forced vital capacity (FVC) was 0. 247 (0. 233) l (p < 0. 001). There was a small but significant fall in SaO 2 during <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> (p = 0. 03).  CONCLUSIONS—Induced sputum contains a higher proportion of viable cells than spontaneous sputum. There are no significant differences between the sputum samples obtained at seven minutes and at 14 minutes of hypertonic saline nebulisation. <b>Sputum</b> <b>induction</b> is safe and well tolerated in patients with COPD. ...|$|E

On the basis of sputum cellularity, we decided to treat the first episode with a course of antibiotics and the second exacerbation with a course of antibiotics and oral steroids. The patient showed improvement in both cases, obtaining clinical stabilisation. The induced sputum cell count could be a useful technique in a clinical setting to evaluate the cellular characteristics of airway inflammation during COPD exacerbation and modulate the antinflammatory therapy...|$|E
40|$|The optimal {{diagnostic}} {{approach to}} pneumonia provides a rapid microbiologic identification of pulmonary pathogens by the least invasive means. The technique of <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> has been {{useful in the}} evaluation of patients with Pneumocystis carinii or mycobacterial pneumonia. It is not known whether induced sputum samples are preferable for the detection of pathogens other than P. carinii or mycobacteria. Microbiologic yields were evaluated from identically processed induced and conventional sputum samples collected from 509 consecutive patients. No statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the microbiologic yields of induced and spontaneous sputum samples. Bacterial pathogens were isolated in 19. 6 % of induced and 23. 5 % of routine specimens. Mycobacteria were cultured from 13. 1 % of routine and 9. 4 % of induced specimens. Non-Candida albicans fungi grew from 24 % of routine and 20 % of induced specimens. The process of <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> with aerosolized hypertonic saline did not alter either the purulence or the bacterial quantitation of Gram-stained sputum specimens. <b>Sputum</b> <b>induction</b> has been useful for the cytologic diagnosis of malignancy, for the diagnosis of pneumocystosis and tuberculosis, and in patients unable to spontaneously produce sputum samples.

40|$|Background Although sputum {{is a good}} {{specimen}} {{for various}} examinations, such as cytology and microbiological culture, <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> (SI) is not a routine procedure in children. Objective To identify the efficacy of SI to obtain specimen from lower respiratory tract in children, identify side effects of SI, {{and the results of}} microbiological examination. Methods A cross sectional study was performed in children (aged 1 month to 18 years) who underwent SI. <b>Sputum</b> <b>induction</b> was performed by inhalation with hypertonic solution, consisted of salbutamol for 15 minutes continued with NaCl 3 % solution for another 15 minutes. Sputum specimens were examined for number of alveolar macrophage cell, surfactant protein A (SP-A) concentration, also acid-fast bacili smear, and M. tuberculosis culture, or aerobic microbial culture. Results Forty subjects with lower respiratory tract infection participated in this study, and SI was succesfully performed in all subjects. Youngest subject was 2 month old, the eldest was 16 year 7 month old. Median duration of SI was 45 minutes, and majority of volume was 3 or 4 mL. Side effects were nosebleeds (40 %) and vomiting (2. 5 %). Macrophage alveolar more than 5 cells in one specimen was found in 97. 5 % subjects. Surfactant protein A examination was performed in 30 specimens, and SP-A was detected in all specimens (median concentration 264. 528 pg/ mL). Culture for M. tuberculosis was positive in 1 of 27 subjects, while acid fast bacili smear was negative in all examined subjects. Aerobic microbial culture was positive in 5 of 13 subjects. Conclusions <b>Sputum</b> <b>induction</b> has good efficacy in obtaining lower respiratory tract specimen and it is safe to perform in children.

40|$|<b>Sputum</b> <b>induction</b> by {{inhalation}} of hypertonic saline {{has been used}} for more than 15 years. It {{has become one of the}} most intriguing methods to study airway inflammation. It is the only direct, non-invasive method for measuring airway inflammation indices. <b>Sputum</b> <b>induction</b> has been used in the diagnosis of many respiratory illnesses including asthma, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, tuberculosis, chronic cough, lung cancer and Pneumocystis Carinii on patients who are unable to produce sputum spontaneously. There are currently many different methods used worldwide to induce sputum, but there is a lack of one generally accepted gold standard method. The proposed protocols for <b>sputum</b> <b>induction</b> proved to be safe, simple and produced satisfactory amount of expectorate. However, it did not contain enough cells from the lower respiratory tract and was contaminated by squamous cells when compared to another method based on the work of F. E. Hargreave. Investigation demonstrated that the use of impulse oscillometry, which requires no effort from patients, needs further research with larger study samples before it could be used instead of spirometry to evaluate airway obstruction. Initial methylene blue stain of the fresh expectorate smear was shown to be useful tool for identifying grossly contaminated sputum samples by squamous epithelial cells. Our first study group included 20 volunteers in good health. Sputum was induced {{by inhalation}} of 3 % saline mist created by ultrasonic nebulizer at maximum output (4 ml/min). <b>Sputum</b> <b>induction</b> intervals lasted 4 - 5 minutes with cumulative duration of induction about 4 - 15 minutes which was tolerated well.
