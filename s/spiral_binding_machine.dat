Documents bound with helical coil (usually called spiral coil) can open flat on a desk or table and offer 360 degree rotation for easy note taking. This binding style is durable and is often used for documents that need to be mailed. <b>Spiral</b> coil <b>binding</b> spines are also available in more colors and sizes than other binding styles.|$|R
40|$|At the Chair of Economics VI: Empirical Economics more {{emphasis}} is placed on the empirical and me-thodical substance of a paper than on its formal aspects. Therefore, the following formal instructions should be regarded as guidelines. Exact compliance with specific formatting rules is not strictly necessary; however, we require you to adhere to a specific formatting and citation style once chosen. Generally, the course language at the Chair of Economics VI: Empirical Economics is English because the research literature is written almost entirely in English. Thus, we recommend writing seminar papers or Bachelor’s/Master’s theses in English. Yet, you are also allowed to write in German. Although formal aspects and writing style will not directly influence your grade, obvious and grave shortcomings can have a negative impact. In that regard, you should avoid frequent spelling mistakes or inconsistent formatting. 2 Length and submission procedure 2. 1 Number of copies and binding • Diploma thesis: two copies (hardback, no <b>spiral</b> <b>binding)</b> • Master’s thesis: three copies (hardback, no <b>spiral</b> <b>binding)</b> • Bachelor’s thesis P&E: three copies (hardback, no <b>spiral</b> <b>binding)</b> • Bachelor’s thesis ECON and IWE: two copies (hardback, no <b>spiral</b> <b>binding...</b>|$|R
