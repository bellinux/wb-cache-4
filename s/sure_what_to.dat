Michael arranges a visit with Hanna in prison, but once there he leaves without seeing her.|$|E

As a child, {{she wanted to be}} a doctor, but by the time she reached high school she was uncertain as to whether she could do that, and not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do in the future. At around this time, she was scouted by a talent agency, and she decided to try the entertainment world. Her parents were initially opposed, but they gave their permission, on two conditions: that she give up if she was making no progress within a year, and that she put her studies first and graduate from university. She has kept the second half of the promise, graduating in commercial science from Meiji University in Tokyo in March 2009.|$|E

25|$|Uranus is {{the third}} largest (Neptune has a larger mass, but a smaller volume) planet in the Solar System. It orbits the Sun at a {{distance}} of about 2.8billion kilometers (1.7billion miles), and it completes one orbit every 84 Earth years. The length of a day on Uranus as measured by Voyager 2 is 17 hours, 14 minutes. Uranus is unique among the planets in that its axial tilt is about 90°, meaning that its axis is roughly parallel with, not perpendicular to, the plane of the ecliptic. This extremely large tilt of its axis is thought {{to be the result of}} a collision between the accumulating planet Uranus with another planet-sized body early in the history of the Solar System. Given the unusual orientation of its axis, with the polar regions of Uranus exposed for periods of many years to either continuous sunlight or darkness, planetary scientists were not at all <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> expect when observing Uranus.|$|E
500|$|The final symphony, the Ninth, was {{completed}} in late 1957 and premiered in April 1958, four months before the composer's death. It is scored for a large orchestra, including three saxophones, a flugelhorn, and an enlarged percussion section. The mood is more sombre {{than that of the}} Eighth; Grove calls its mood [...] "at once heroic and contemplative, defiant and wistfully absorbed". The work received an ovation at its premiere, but at first the critics were not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> make of it, and it took some years for it to be generally ranked alongside its eight predecessors.|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack {{is a mix}} of {{rock and}} roll and rhythm and blues with the {{original}} score created by film composer Elmer Bernstein, who had been a Landis family friend since John Landis was a child. Bernstein was easily persuaded to score the film, but was not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> make of it. Similar to his preferring dramatic actors for the comedy, Landis asked Bernstein to score it as though it were serious. He adapted the [...] "Faber College Theme" [...] from the Academic Festival Overture by Brahms, and said that the film opened yet another door in his diverse career, to scoring comedies.|$|E

500|$|Writing for the Los Angeles Times, critic Andrew Hanson {{referred}} to audiences' Friday night plans away from television when he commented the episode was [...] "better than any movie you're {{going to see}} in the theater right now". Hanson thought the mystery produced [...] "surprises around every corner". IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, explaining he enjoyed the [...] "classic Fringe" [...] opening scene, the [...] "decent [...] job" [...] by Ruck, and John Noble's performance; he also thought the script was [...] "very clever [...] it reveals surprising story elements with innovative tricks". Isler wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> make of the Bell-Olivia plot twist however, commenting that [...] "this new William Bell thing is either going to end up as the best plot device of the season, or the cheesiest thing in recent sci-fi history".|$|E

As the draft approached, it was reported the Canucks were also shopping Schneider. Originally, it was believed the rumors were an attempt by Gillis to gain leverage for any potential Luongo deals. However, in a surprise move, Schneider was trade to the New Jersey Devils for the ninth overall pick in the draft, which Vancouver used to select Bo Horvat. Fans, as well as both Luongo and Schneider, were shocked by the news. Luongo stated, [...] "I have to let this sink in and figure out what I'm going to do." [...] While Schneider stated he was not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> say or think and he was speechless, adding, [...] "it was nice to have resolution to the situation." ...|$|E
500|$|Showrunner Steven Moffat {{wished to}} bring back the Daleks, as they were popular among {{children}} and had become [...] "one of the regulars". He stated in March 2010 that he and the production team had considered redesigning the Daleks. Mark Gatiss, the writer of the episode, was instructed by Moffat to write an episode about [...] "Churchill versus the Daleks". Gatiss was not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with the premise at first, but then became excited about doing a war movie, of which he was fond, and his own Dalek story. For research, he visited the real Cabinet War Rooms and read diaries and first-hand accounts of the war. Gatiss's inspiration was the 1966 serial The Power of the Daleks, though he had never seen it due to it being lost, which depicted them as more sly and silent, an aspect he called [...] "very scary, more than when they're just barking orders".|$|E
5000|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave Practical Magic a {{negative}} review, calling it [...] "a witch comedy so slapdash, plodding, and muddled {{it seems to}} have had a hex put on it."

For the music of [...] "Ghost", Boots created a beat from [...] a [...] "dreamlike, hypnotic place" [...] working with guitars and building layers inspired by the work of musician Aphex Twin. Boots said, [...] " [...] works like that are more floaty, more without than within, but I made mine grounded in that thumping beat, so you can't get out of that feeling." [...] He also elaborated about its concept, [...] "It's like that song is leading you by the hand, but you're blindfolded and you don't know where you're going.

500|$|... "The Same Old Story" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. TV Squad writer Jane Boursaw thought the episode seemed [...] "all over the place", and wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> think. She stated {{the two most}} interesting parts of the episode were when Walter removed the girl's eye in order to identity her killer, and the cliffhanger at the very end, when Walter states [...] "If you've read my file, then you know the truth about Peter's medical history". Travis Fickett of IGN thought {{it was better than}} the pilot; though it was [...] "laden with lots of clunky exposition and clichéd dialogue," [...] Fickett understood that it was needed to acquaint new viewers to the show. Fickett concluded his review by saying Fringe {{has the potential to be}} a [...] "great show", and he also praised the production level as [...] "top notch", and Torv's performance as [...] "very good" [...] as she [...] "brings a unique presence to the show". The A.V. Club critic Noel Murray gave the episode a C+, while Television Without Pity graded it with a B.|$|E

David Johnson of the DVD Verdict positively reacted to the DVD release of the episode and said [...] "I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> say, here. Mr. Squarepants is so ridiculously popular, this disc will most definitely sell itself." [...] Aida Ekberg of Yahoo! Voices ranked Amy Poehler on her [...] "Top 10 SpongeBob SquarePants Guest Stars" [...] list and said [...] "I'm surprised more comedians haven't been guest stars on SpongeBob. Amy Poehler does a great job with her creepy grandma voice, playing pure evil masked behind plate after plate of chocolate chip cookies." [...] Paul Mavis of DVD Talk loved the scene [...] "When Gary realizes he has to escape from her crushing love (which equals constant overeating) or die like the other snail shells he finds" [...] He said [...] "it's both funny and rather touching." ...|$|E

500|$|Macaulay {{displayed}} a temper when matters went against him. Robertson-Glasgow {{described him as}} an unusual man, [...] "fiercely independent, witty, argumentative, swift to joy and anger. He had pleasure in cracking a convention or cursing an enemy... A cricket-bag came {{between him and his}} blazer hanging on a peg; and he'd kick it and tell it a truth or two, then laugh." [...] Bill Bowes described how, when he was bowling, he would glare and mutter under his breath; he seemed to be [...] "filled with a devilish energy". He would make sharp or biting comments, particularly if a fielder made a mistake when he was bowling and although often amusing, it could at times hurt the recipients, and his anger made his team-mates wary of him. Yet, he could also express appreciation when a skillful batsmen hit a good shot from his bowling; the result was that his colleagues were never <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> expect from him, even after playing with him for years. Herbert Sutcliffe said he could be charming when not playing, but his wit could be sharp. Robertson-Glasgow nevertheless described him as [...] "a glorious opponent; a great cricketer; and a companion in a thousand".|$|E
500|$|Paul's sixteenth CD, The Day After Everything Changed, was {{released}} on January 12, 2010. Rather than work with a record label, Paul invited fans to help finance the recording by offering donors various premiums determined by the level of donation. [...] Although Paul wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> expect when the United States economy collapsed, the fan-funding initiative resulted in more than $100,000 being collected - more, according to Paul, - than any label had ever spent on him. Recorded in Nashville with a guest appearance by Kristian Bush that includes a duet on the track, [...] "Paper Dolls", Paul says the fan support inspired him to make [...] "the best record I could". One reviewer wrote: [...] "This is such a tuneful, beautifully drawn set of songs played and sung with authority that it reminds you how much we need storytellers back in pop music—storytellers with empathy, fine eyes and an understanding that even though {{we live in a}} soulless, indifferent world our music doesn't have to reflect our culture."

500|$|After what he {{felt was}} a period of bad episodes {{culminating}} with [...] "Stranger in a Strange Land", critic Andrew Dignan of Slant Magazine praised [...] "Tricia Tanaka Is Dead" [...] as a [...] "palate cleanser, reminding us that this show is meant to be, above all else, fun". He described the episode as an [...] "expected pleasure, disarming in a way [...] hasn't been since Season One, back before these people became jaded by [...] "Others" [...] and consumed with tedious busy work while the show's producers figured out what frequently disappointing direction to push them in next." [...] Dignan did however acknowledge that others might not have found the episode as enjoyable as he did. Erin Martell of TV Squad wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> think of the episode, believing that it was [...] "entertaining" [...] but produced nothing new for viewers. She did note that the characters are now in place to take action for following episodes, and hoped that the episode's [...] "slow-moving events" [...] were [...] "building up to some serious resolution". Rather than dismiss the episode for lacking a mythology-related storyline, Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "a joyous and poignant hour of television", and said that it [...] "could very well be a cleverly crafted allegory for the history of The Dharma Initiative on The Island." ...|$|E

500|$|As a retailer, Marcus {{believed}} {{strongly in}} making his store {{into a place}} where everything a customer needed could be found and, if necessary, brought to the customer's front door. He {{was said to have}} helped one customer discover the shoe size of Queen Elizabeth II so as to give the gift of stockings and a pair of shoes, and he ordered that the store stock such items as a set of Steuben plates with the Mexican national crest, [...] "because sooner or later somebody will be going to call on the President of Mexico and need a proper gift." [...] He personally delivered a fur coat to a St. Louis, Missouri, customer who could not make the trip to Dallas. Another story often recounted is that of a shopper who, in searching for a present for his wife, said that he was not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> buy, but that he would know it when he saw it. In response, Marcus inquired about the woman's clothing sizes and asked the customer to wait briefly. Taking an oversized brandy snifter from a display, Marcus gathered cashmere sweaters of various colors, arranged them in imitation of a pousse-café, topped with a white angora sweater to simulate whipped cream, and in place of a cherry, garnished the concoction with a 10-karat ruby ring, at a total cost of $25,350, which the customer gladly paid. When one customer decided his Christmas purchases were not sufficiently impressive, Marcus helped to arrange a full duplication of the store's display window, complete with mannequins and lighting, inside the man's home.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Jane Boursaw of TV Squad wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> think about [...] "The Bishop Revival", but loved the plotline about Walter's dad being a German spy {{working for the}} US government. Alternately, Annalee Newitz of io9 called the episode [...] "surprisingly meh"; while appreciating [...] "all the weird family revelations about the Bishops", she believed the revelations about Walter's father to be [...] "too much" [...] because [...] "we didn't need that extra backstory". Newitz wished Fringe had brought back Olivia's childhood subplot and its ties with Walter and Peter. The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray was also critical of the episode, explaining [...] "Plotwise, there wasn't much going on in 'The Bishop Revival.'... The FD tracked down a criminal and felled that criminal; that's really it." [...] Murray did however praise the killer's methods and [...] "Aryan aloofness" [...] as [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "delightfully old-school". Like Newitz, Tim Grierson of the magazine New York believed the episode contained [...] "stupid revelations"; for instance, the Nazi connection of Walter's father [...] "just felt like a variation on season one's episodes in which bizarre phenomena could always magically be linked back to Walter's work for the government. Obviously, this info about Peter's grandfather {{was supposed to be}} 'shocking,' showing how the Bishop family's scientific work can so easily be perverted for evil, but by this point it just seems like a very artificial, unnecessary ploy to keep us engaged." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael's first centric {{episode in}} season two was less well received. Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com said [...] "it wasn't all that interesting". Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen called the flashbacks [...] "among the poorest and most clumsily {{integrated}} flashbacks we've seen so far", {{as he felt}} nothing new was learned. He did not like Michael's on-Island storyline either, noting he [...] "got {{the sense that the}} actors and directors weren't quite <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> make of these scenes". Three episodes later, Jensen thought Michael's [...] "whiny dad act" [...] became [...] "increasingly tedious". When Michael murdered Ana Lucia and Libby in [...] "Two for the Road", Slocum called it the [...] "single biggest shocker in Lost history". C. K. Sample of AOL's TV Squad wrote that although he suspected that Ana Lucia and Libby were going to die, he thought what [...] "was amazing was who shot them". Zap2it's Amy Amatangelo described the double murder as [...] "a brilliant move", because [...] "one of their own [...] one of them". She added it was [...] "one of [...] season's most jaw-dropping moments". According to Perrineau, it made fans [...] "pissed off" [...] with Michael. Jensen praised Perrineau's acting, saying [...] "Michael's bloody betrayal is hard to swallow, but Harold Perrineau sells it". Many reviewers joked about how frequently Michael shouts [...] "Walt!", such as Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger, Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad, and Joshua Rich of Entertainment Weekly.
