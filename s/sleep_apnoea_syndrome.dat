As a consequence of apnoea-hypopnoea an imbalance in myocardial oxygen delivery/consumption ratio will develop, sympathetic and other neurohormonal systems will be activated and right and left ventricular afterload will be increased. Sleep apnoea is associated with an increased mortality in patients with systolic heart failure. Treatment of sleep apnoea increases left ventricular ejection fraction and transplant-free survival. Because of its high prevalence, poor quality of life, poor outcome, and the beneficial effects of treatment, physicians treating patients with heart failure should be aware of central sleep apnoea. There are different treatment options, but the exact effects and indications of each option have not yet been fully determined.

The pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in OSAS is not completely understood but likely to be multifactorial, involving a diverse range of mechanisms including sympathetic nervous system overactivity, selective activation of inflammatory molecular pathways, endothelial dysfunction, abnormal coagulation and metabolic dysregulation, the latter particularly involving insulin resistance and disordered lipid metabolism. The present report, which arose out of a European Union Cooperation {{in the field of}} Scientific and Technical Research (COST) action on OSAS (COST B 26), reviews the current evidence for an independent association and proposes research priorities to identify the underlying mechanisms involved, with a view to identifying novel therapeutic strategies.

The examination following the Brouillette criteria was defined as negative, positive or inconclusive; when positive, adenotonsillectomy was the first therapeutic approach.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Figures for the {{prevalence}} of <b>sleep</b> <b>apnoea</b> <b>syndrome</b> range from 0. 3 % to 8. 5 %. These widely ranged estimates are probably {{due to differences in}} the definitions used, study designs, and study populations. A study was undertaken to determine the lower limit of {{the prevalence}} of clinically significant <b>sleep</b> <b>apnoea</b> <b>syndrome.</b>  METHODS—A cross sectional survey by postal questionnaire was carried out in a general practice of a small town in which three doctors serve 93 % of its population of 6747 inhabitants of all ages. All men aged 35 and over and women aged 50 and over were invited to fill in a specially designed questionnaire on snoring and sleep. All men and women whose answers suggested the possible occurrence of sleep apnoea were invited to undergo further investigation. Oronasal thermistry was performed in the subjects' homes and the results were scored to provide an apnoea index (AI). Those subjects with an AI of ⩾ 5 were referred to a sleep laboratory for investigation by polysomnography.  RESULTS—Of the 2466 questionnaires issued, 2182 (88. 5 %) were completed and returned. The occurrence during the previous three months of regular snoring, together with daytime sleepiness and/or partners' observation of interruptions in breathing at night, was reported by 194 subjects (169 men, 25 women). In 173 subjects oronasal thermistry applied in their homes provided satisfactory recordings and, of these, 24 men and one woman had an AI of ⩾ 5. Analysis of the polysomnographic findings showed that 14 men and one woman met the criteria for <b>sleep</b> <b>apnoea</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Scrutiny of their case records disclosed that in seven men this was clinically significant.  CONCLUSIONS—Our findings suggest that {{the prevalence of}} clinically significant <b>sleep</b> <b>apnoea</b> <b>syndrome</b> in men aged 35 and over is at least 0. 45 %.

Treating SAS results in a normalized rate of traffic accidents. As part of the COST Action B- 26, we looked at driving license regulations, and especially at its medical aspects in the European region.

Results: Driving license regulations date from 1997 onwards. Excessive daytime sleepiness is mentioned in nine, whereas <b>sleep</b> <b>apnoea</b> <b>syndrome</b> is mentioned in 10 countries. A patient with untreated sleep apnoea is always considered unfit to drive. To recover the driving capacity, seven countries rely on a physician’s medical certificate based on symptom control and compliance with therapy, whereas in two countries it is up to the patient to decide (on his doctor’s advice) to drive again. Only FR requires a normalized electroencephalography (EEG) -based Maintenance of Wakefulness Test for professional drivers.

40|$|ABSTRACT It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that enlarged values of morphological measurements manifesting obesity intensify the risk of sleep disturbances. The main goal of this work was to find a set of predictor morphometric variables that best distinguish between the mutually exclusive groups of interest, the well and the ill – i. e., those who suffer from obstructive <b>sleep</b> <b>apnoea</b> (OSA) <b>syndrome,</b> and healthy patients. Somatic measurements of 96 males were taken. To analyze the dependencies between the degree of intensity of the studied pathology (oxygen desaturation index) and the values of the somatic measurements, the discriminant function analysis was applied. The use of this method allowed obtaining a set of sleep obstructive disturbance predictors. The correctness of classification into the group of healthy individuals was esti-mated at 81. 4 %, while correctness of classification into the group of OSA was estimated at 91. 3 %. The results showed that somatic measurements {{could be used as a}} preliminary index of individuals requiring further examination...|$|R
40|$|Background: Exercise {{limitation}} {{is an important}} issue in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and it often co-exists with obstructive <b>sleep</b> <b>apnoea</b> (overlap <b>syndrome).</b> This study examined the effects of nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on walking capacity in COPD patients with or without obstructive <b>sleep</b> <b>apnoea.</b> Methods: Forty-four stable moderate-to-severe COPD patients were recruited and completed this study. They all underwent polysomnography, CPAP titration, accommodation, and treatment with adequate pressure. The incremental shuttle walking test was used to measure walking capacity at baseline and after two nights of CPAP treatment. Urinary catecholamine and heart rate variability were measured before and after CPAP treatment. Results: After two nights of CPAP treatment, the apnoea-hypopnoea index and oxygen desaturation index significantly improved in both overlap syndrome and COPD patients, however these changes were significantly greater in the overlap syndrome than in the COPD group. Sleep architecture and autonomic dysfunction significantly improved in the overlap syndrome group but not in the COPD group. CPAP treatment was associated with an increased walking capacity from baseline from 226. 4 ± 95. 3 m to 288. 6 ± 94. 6 m (P < 0. 05), and decreased urinary catecholamine levels, pre-exercise heart rate, oxygenation, and Borg scale in the overlap syndrome group...|$|R
