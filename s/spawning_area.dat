In 2003, the upper River Mole near Meath Green Lane, Horley, was enhanced to create a gravel <b>spawning</b> <b>area</b> to encourage chub and dace in addition to roach. In 1974 zander, a non-indigenous coarse fish native to Europe, were introduced legally to Old Bury Hill Lake which supplies the Pipp Brook.

40|$|Catadromous anguillid eels (genus Anguilla) {{migrate from}} their {{freshwater}} or estuarine habitats to marine <b>spawning</b> <b>areas.</b> Evidence from satellite tagging studies indicates that tropical and temperate eel species exhibit pronounced diel vertical migrations, from between 150 - 300 m nighttime depths to 600 - 800 m during the day. Collections of eggs and larvae of Japanese eels A. japonica suggest they may spawn at these upper nighttime migration depths. How anguillid eels navigate through {{the ocean and}} find their <b>spawning</b> <b>areas</b> remains unknown; thus, this study describes the salinity, temperature and geostrophic currents between 0 and 800 m depths within 2 confirmed and 3 hypothetical anguillid <b>spawning</b> <b>areas</b> during likely <b>spawning</b> seasons. Within the 4 ocean gyres in which these <b>spawning</b> <b>areas</b> are located, many eels would encounter subducted 'Subtropical Underwater' water masses during their nighttime ascents that could provide odor plumes as signposts. Four of the <b>spawning</b> <b>areas</b> are located near the western margins of where subducted water masses form cores of elevated salinities (similar to 35. 0 to 36. 8) around 150 m depths, and one is located {{near the center of}} subduction. Low salinity surface waters and fronts are present in some of the areas above the high-salinity cores. Spawning may occur at temperatures between 16 and 24 degrees C where the thermocline locally deepens. At spawning depths, weak westward currents (similar to 0 to 0. 1 m s(- 1)) prevail, and eastward surface countercurrents are present. Anguillid eels possess acute sensory capabilities to detect these hydrographic features as potential signposts, guiding them to their <b>spawning</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The term prespawn {{mortality}} {{is used to}} refer to fish that arrive successfully at the spawning grounds, and then die without spawning. Prespawn {{mortality is}} surprisingly variable, with one study observing rates between 3% and 90%.

40|$|Abstract. — Radio {{telemetry}} {{was used}} to determine the distribution of sockeye salmon Onco-rhynchus nerka returning to spawn in the glacial Taku River in 1984 and 1986, and to locate and characterize <b>spawning</b> <b>areas</b> used by this species. During the study, 253 sockeye salmon were tracked as they moved upriver; 204 of these were followed to <b>spawning</b> <b>areas.</b> Only 37 % of the 204 fish traveled to areas associated with lakes; the remaining 63 % returned to "riverine " areas-river areas without lakes (42 % to the Taku River main stem, 17 % to the Nakina River, and 4 % to other rivers). Sockeye salmon <b>spawning</b> in riverine <b>areas</b> used a variety of habitat types, including main-river channels, side channels, tributary streams, and upland sloughs. Most (55 %) of the radio-tagged fish that returned to the Taku River main stem were tracked to side-channel <b>spawning</b> <b>areas.</b> Half of the 471 adult sockeye salmon sampled in main-stem <b>spawning</b> <b>areas</b> had migrated to sea as juveniles before their first winter. This study showed that many sockeye salmon returning to the Taku River do not depend on lakes, and that riverine sockeye salmon make up a major portion of the run in some river systems.

5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} the species from {{becoming}} extinct have had modest success. Pallid sturgeon are actively being raised in a dozen hatcheries and the offspring are being released back to the wild every year. To better understand pallid sturgeon behavior, researchers have implanted radio transmitters to track their movements and help identify possible <b>spawning</b> <b>areas.</b> Federal and state agencies are working together to improve habitat by restoring <b>spawning</b> <b>areas</b> since restoration of these areas is required if the species is {{to survive in the}} wild.|$|R
40|$|Like large {{hydropower}} {{counterparts in}} the Columbia River, low-elevation dams and irrigation diversions may impede adult salmonid migrations as fish approach <b>spawning</b> <b>areas</b> in smaller tributaries. The Umatilla River has seven low elevation dams that may obstruct Chinook salmon and steelhead access to historic <b>spawning</b> <b>areas.</b> We used radio telemetry to examine fallback rates, passage routes, rates, and delays, holding and spawning locations, and maximum upstream distribution of Chinook salmon and steelhead in the Umatilla River basin (Oregon). Analyses focused {{on the effects of}} project modifications on salmonid passage and overall system use by fish. Detections at fixed receivers and mobile tracking of 476 tagged steelhead, 130 spring Chinook salmon, and 206 fall Chinook salmon from 2009 - 2012 provided data for these analyses. Recent project modifications at individual diversion structures have resulted in marked improvements in fish passages times. Species show preference for different aspects of the modifications; for example, jump pools are used by spring Chinook more than steelhead. System passage times have also been markedly reduced. Locating key holding and <b>spawning</b> <b>areas</b> will provide information for additional habitat and restoration needs. The determination of upstream distribution and spawning of hatchery fish will allow managers to better assess the use of hatchery releases to supplement historical <b>spawning</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Since 1946, the Fisheries Research Institute (FRI) has {{conducted}} research {{studies on the}} adult spawning populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) within the Wood River Lakes system, Alaska (Figs. 1 - 5). These studies have included population enumeration by aerial surveys and ground counts (Gilbert 1968) and determination of sex ratios, fecundity, and age composition. A primary objective is to study the relationship between parent escapements and adult returns for individual <b>spawning</b> <b>areas</b> and to study the differences in relative production and age at maturity among <b>spawning</b> <b>areas.</b> Consistency must be maintained in the field procedures to compare data on individual <b>spawning</b> <b>areas</b> among years.
