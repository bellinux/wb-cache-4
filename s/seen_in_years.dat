5|$|In December 1944, the German army, {{under the}} command of German Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, {{launched}} a last-ditch offensive across Belgium, Luxembourg, and northeastern France. On December 16, 1944, it massed 29 divisions totaling 250,000 men at a weak point in the Allied lines, and during {{the early stages of the}} ensuing Battle of the Bulge, made significant headway towards the Meuse River during the worst winter Europe had <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>years.</b> Eisenhower called a meeting of all senior Allied commanders on the Western Front to a headquarters near Verdun on the morning of December 19 to plan strategy and a response to the German assault.|$|E

25|$|On 16 December 1944 the Germans {{launched}} their last-gasp major offensive {{of the war}} in the Ardennes forest that became known as the Battle of the Bulge. The 1st Battalion, Ox and Bucks, {{along with the rest of}} 53rd (Welsh) Division, was rushed to Belgium shortly afterwards to assist in the defence where the battalion endured terrible weather conditions, some of the worst Belgium had <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>years.</b> The Allies launched a counter-attack in early January and the German offensive was defeated later that month, by which time the 53rd (Welsh) Division had been relieved and returned to the Netherlands soon afterwards in preparation for the invasion of Germany.|$|E

Wedemeyer. MacArthur received a parade there that was attended by 500,000 people. He was greeted on arrival at Washington National Airport on 19 April by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and General Jonathan Wainwright. Truman sent Vaughan as his representative, which was seen as a slight, as Vaughan was despised by the public and professional soldiers alike as a corrupt crony. [...] "It was a shameful thing to fire MacArthur, and even more shameful to send Vaughan," [...] one member of the public wrote to Truman.|$|E
500|$|Oblivion {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, {{and became}} a commercial success. The game had shipped 1.7million copies by April 10, 2006, sold over 3million copies by January 2007, and over 3.5 million by November 2011. Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, a market research firm, estimates that the game has sold 9.5 million copies worldwide. Reviewers praised the game for its impressive graphics, expansive game world and schedule-driven NPCs. Eurogamer editor Kristan Reed stated that the game [...] "successfully unites {{some of the best}} elements of RPG, adventure and action games and fuses them into a relentlessly immersive and intoxicating whole". GameSpot's Greg Kasavin wrote that compared to Morrowind, {{which was one of the}} best role-playing games he has <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>years,</b> [...] "Oblivion is hands-down better, so much so that even those who'd normally have no interest in a role-playing game should find it hard to resist getting swept up in this big, beautiful, meticulously crafted world". X-Plays Jason D'Aprile stated, [...] "All the games in this series have been known for their sheer vastness and freedom of choice, but the Elder Scrolls IV takes that concept and runs with it".|$|E

However, he is won over when he meets Manjula at the wedding, and the two decide to give the marriage a try, with Manjula noting nonchalantly that they can always get a divorce. Later, the two actually fall in love.|$|E

The number of people {{gathering}} in front of Anıtkabir, the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in Ankara, was cited as ranging from [...] "hundreds of thousands" [...] to 1.5 million people. The first protest {{was one of the}} largest that Turkey had <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>years</b> until then. The target of the first protest was the possible presidential candidacy of the current Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (the outcome of which will be determined by the Turkish Grand National Assembly (unless the recent modifications on the constitution become ratified on time), in which Erdoğan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) has a healthy majority). Erdoğan decided not to run for president after the rally.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 February 1996, {{following}} {{the publication of}} the Scott Report into the 'Arms-to-Iraq' affair, he made a famous speech in response to the then President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang in which he said [...] "this is not just a Government which does not know how to accept blame; it is a Government which knows no shame". His parliamentary performance on the occasion of {{the publication of the}} five-volume, 2,000-page Scott Report—which he claimed he was given just two hours to read before the relevant debate, thus giving him three seconds to read every page—was widely praised on both sides of the House as one of the best performances the Commons had <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>years,</b> and one of Cook's finest hours. The government won the vote by a majority of one.|$|E

2500|$|Apocalypto {{gained some}} passionate champions in the Hollywood community. Actor Robert Duvall called it [...] "maybe the best movie I've seen in 25 years". Director Quentin Tarantino said, [...] "I think it's a masterpiece. It {{was perhaps the}} best film of that year. I {{think it was the}} best artistic film of that year." [...] Martin Scorsese, writing about the film, called it [...] "a vision," [...] adding, [...] "Many {{pictures}} today don't go into troubling areas like this, the importance of violence in the perpetuation of what's known as civilization. I admire Apocalypto for its frankness, but also for the power and artistry of the filmmaking." [...] Actor Edward James Olmos said, [...] "I was totally caught off guard. It's arguably the best movie I've <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>years.</b> I was blown away." [...] In 2013, director Spike Lee put the film on his list of all-time essential films.|$|E
2500|$|Given Newfoundland's {{strategic}} {{location in}} the Battle of the Atlantic, the Allies (especially the United States of America) built many military bases there. [...] Large numbers of unskilled men gained the first paycheques they had <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>years</b> by working on construction and in dockside crews. National income doubled as an economic boom {{took place in the}} Avalon Peninsula and to a lesser degree in Gander, Botwood, and Stephenville. The United States became the main supplier, and American money and influence diffused rapidly from the military, naval, and air bases. Prosperity returned to the fishing industry by 1943. Government revenues, aided by inflation and new income, quadrupled, even though Newfoundland had tax rates much lower than those in Canada, Britain, or the United States. To the astonishment of all, Newfoundland started financing loans to London. Wartime prosperity ended the long depression and reopened the question of political status.|$|E

2500|$|Stanley Kauffmann, in The New Republic, wrote, [...] "This is {{the scariest}} film I've seen in years—the only scary film I've <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>years...</b> If {{you want to}} be shaken—and I found out, while the picture was going, that that's what I wanted—then The Exorcist will scare the… (shit) out of you." [...] Variety noted that it was [...] "an expert telling of a supernatural horror story... The climactic {{sequences}} assault the senses and the intellect with pure cinematic terror." [...] In Castle of Frankenstein, Joe Dante called it [...] "an amazing film, and one destined to become at the very least a horror classic. Director Friedkin's film will be profoundly disturbing to all audiences, especially the more sensitive and those who tend to 'live' the movies they see... Suffice it to say, there has never been anything like this on the screen before." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film a 4-out-of-4 star review, praising the actors (particularly Burstyn) and the convincing special effects {{but at the end of}} the review wrote, [...] "I am not sure exactly what reasons people will have for seeing this movie; surely enjoyment won’t be one, because what we get here aren’t the delicious chills of a Vincent Price thriller, but raw and painful experience. Are people so numb they need movies of this intensity in order to feel anything at all?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Redden {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan where {{he became one of}} the stars of Fielding H. Yost's famous [...] "Point-a-Minute" [...] teams of 1901, 1902, and 1903. [...] The 1901 team compiled a record of 110 and outscored its opponents 5500. In Redden's sophomore, junior and senior years, Michigan was 3301 and outscored opponents by a total of 1,764 to 18. [...] At the end of his senior season, Redden was a unanimous first-team All-Western selection, including designations by the Chicago Record-Herald, The Chicago Daily News, and The Inter-Ocean. [...] He was one of only five players upon whom the [...] "Western football critics have been able to unanimously agree." [...] The Chicago Daily News also designated Redden as the captain of its 1903 All-Western team and explained its choice as follows:"Redden's cool head in a game, his speed and strong playing mark him as the most legitimate selection for captain among all the other captains ... Redden's speed up the field on punts, his ability to stiff arm every interferer without slackening up that speed, and his open-field tackling mark him as the best end for the pure type of end work the west has <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>years.</b> [...] Offensively his skill lies in assisting his tackle in boxing an opponent and assisting the runner after he has passed the line." ...|$|E
