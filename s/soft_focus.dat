5|$|The game began {{development}} in September 1995, {{as part of}} a publishing deal with BMG Interactive. When this deal fell through, the development team turned their focus to the Nintendo 64, which allowed for a more advanced environment and model processing. The hardware also shaped the game's humour and style, with a <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> look leading to a style akin to Plasticine models. The game's distinct British humour was also used to distinguish it from other games. Similarly, the game's music was created to resemble B movies.|$|E
5|$|Vampyr was {{challenging}} for Dreyer {{to make as}} {{it was his first}} sound film and had to be recorded in three languages. To overcome this, very little dialogue was used in the film and much of the story is told with silent film-styled title cards. The film was shot entirely on location and to enhance the atmospheric content, Dreyer opted for a washed out, <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> photographic technique. The audio editing was done in Berlin where the character's voices, sound effects, and score were added to the film.|$|E
25|$|At first, {{fine art}} photographers tried to imitate {{painting}} styles. This movement is called Pictorialism, often using <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> for a dreamy, 'romantic' look. In reaction to that, Weston, Ansel Adams, and others formed the Group f/64 to advocate 'straight photography', the photograph as a (sharply focused) thing in itself {{and not an}} imitation of something else.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The zone plate <b>focused</b> <b>soft</b> X-rays of a {{scanning}} transmission X-ray microscope {{have been}} used to pattern poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly(dimethylglutarimide) films by a direct write method which is analogous to litho-graphy with a focused electron beam. The lithographic characteristics of both polymers have been determined for 300 eV X-rays. With low doses (1 MGy), developed lines 40 ± 5 nm wide were created in poly(methyl methacrylate). At higher doses an exposure spreading phenomenon sub-stantially increases the lateral dimensions of the developed patterns. The spreading mechanism has been identified as the point-spread function of the zone plate lens. The per-formance of <b>focused</b> <b>soft</b> X-ray lithography is compared to other direct write methods. The practicality of a dedicated <b>focused</b> <b>soft</b> X-ray writer instrument is discussed. ...|$|R
25|$|Weston {{was born}} in Chicago and moved to California when he was 21. He {{knew he wanted to}} be a {{photographer}} from an early age, and initially his work was typical of the <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> pictorialism that was popular at the time. Within a few years, however, he abandoned that style and went on to be one of the foremost champions of highly detailed photographic images.|$|E
25|$|The {{magazine}} {{was founded on}} humble beginnings. Due to Guccione's lack of resources, he personally photographed most of the models for the magazine's early issues. Without professional training, Guccione applied his knowledge of painting to his photography, establishing the diffused, <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> look that {{would become one of}} the trademarks of the magazine's pictorials. Guccione would sometimes take several days to complete a shoot.|$|E
25|$|In issue 48 Stieglitz {{introduced}} {{the work of}} a young photographer, Paul Strand, whose photographic vision was indicative of the aesthetic changes now at the heart of Camera Work's demise. Strand shunned the <b>soft</b> <b>focus</b> and symbolic content of the Pictorialists and instead strived to create a new vision that found beauty in the clear lines and forms of ordinary objects. By publishing Strand’s work Stieglitz was hastening the end of the aesthetic vision he had championed for so long.|$|E

It was also released on PC CD-ROM, featuring Chris Barrie {{as the voice of}} Simon. Simon Woodroffe stated that he had Barrie in mind when writing the scripts, and that it was easier for him to do so when thinking of an actor he knew speaking the lines. It cost around £3000 per day to hire Barrie. Woodroffe said that there was [...] "no hesitation" [...] in doing a talkie version, and that it was [...] "the next big thing". Simon the Sorcerer used the visual and interface designs from LucasArts' games, and Woodroffe stated that this was because they had set a standard, and that Adventure <b>Soft's</b> <b>focus</b> was humour and story-telling.|$|R

Gilroy {{believes}} that, in contrast to desaturated, man-made feel {{that the city is}} often depicted as, Los Angeles is a [...] "landscape of primal struggle and survival". Gyllenhaal's animalistic approach to the script influenced this belief, and the idea was to film Nightcrawler like a wildlife documentary.

5|$|Speaking {{about the}} move from Namco Bandai to Nintendo, Sugiura commented {{that it was a}} {{challenge}} to only be developing games for a single group of consoles, but then Nintendo endorsed the challenge to Monolith Soft with incentives such as making a particular game within given hardware specifications, with Nintendo providing the company time and resources to accomplish that. Another factor that changed within Monolith Soft's development process was Nintendo's increased quality control, which would moot any project that did not have the desired quality for their systems. The sense of challenge was also echoed by Takahashi, who described both Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles X as being partially defined by self-imposed challenges to the development team when creating the environments on limited gaming hardware. Monolith Soft's scope and goals are often attributed to Takahashi's drive and ambition. While commonly associated with Japanese role-playing games (JRPGs), Monolith <b>Soft</b> <b>focuses</b> more on making role-playing games for a worldwide audience.|$|R
5000|$|Enslaved {{released}} the album Vertebrae in September 2008, their tenth studio album and their first on Nuclear Blast. Terrorizer Magazine named it the {{album of the}} year in 2008, notably above other metal releases such as Meshuggah's obZen and Opeth's Watershed. After touring Europe extensively, Enslaved embarked on a North American tour with the progressive death metal band Opeth in May 2009. The album is noted for is shift in its approach and its diverse sounds; Sammy O'Hagar from MetalSucks.net even says that [...] "to call Vertebrae black metal would be quite a stretch" [...] because [...] "there’s an impressive depth to it that surpasses the sour misanthropy so often (and rightfully) associated with the genre", and furthermore describing their sound as [...] "heavy and surprisingly <b>soft,</b> <b>focused</b> and curious, true to their roots and longing to forget them". The album's sound has been said to be akin to Pink Floyd's sound on a few occasions, as well as other black metal releases in a similar vein.|$|R

While he had made striking use of sharp outlines and silhouettes in earlier works such as [...] "I Was Killing When Killing Wasn't Cool" [...] and [...] "The Blood-Clot Boy", in [...] "Amnesia" [...] he used a combination of watercolor, acrylic paint, ink, charcoal, and digital tools to create minutely detailed chiaroscuro backgrounds that contrast with the cartoony look of the characters. As Paul Gravett commented: [...] "Al works his flat, outlined Seymour and his pal into what look like <b>soft</b> <b>focussed</b> stills from some vintage black and white animated film. His bigfoot characters scurry about amongst period buildings and backgrounds that are richly textured and photorealist, bathed centre stage in glowing light, but shrouded in threatening shadow in the wings.

500|$|Frank Capra's The Bitter Tea of General Yen was {{not quite}} the same type of film: Stanwyck plays a missionary who goes to civil-war-torn China and meets the titular general (played by Nils Asther) after his car kills the driver of her rickshaw. When she is knocked {{unconscious}} in a riot, he takes her out of the rabble and onto a train car. She has lurid, horror-themed, symbolic dreams about the General, in which she is both titillated and repulsed by him. The film breaks precedent by developing into an interracial love story, but his army ends in ruins. Yen kills himself at the film's conclusion—by drinking poisoned tea—rather than be captured and killed. Capra adored the script and disregarded the risk of making a film that broke California's (and 29 other states') laws concerning the portrayal of miscegenation. Cinematographer Joseph Walker tested a new technique he created, which he dubbed [...] "Variable Diffusion", in filming the picture. This rendered the entire picture in very <b>soft</b> <b>focus.</b>|$|E
500|$|Throughout the novel, Little Bee {{considers}} how {{she would}} explain England to [...] "the girls back home" [...] in Nigeria. Cleave uses the girls as a Greek chorus, providing a foil to allow the cultural dissonance experienced by Little Bee to be made explicit. He feels the device is more natural than having Little Bee narrate her alarm first hand, allowing the reader to appreciate the cultural gulf, and Little Bee to seem knowing as opposed to tragic. Through Little Bee's narration, Cleave examines human culture from the opposite perspective as science fiction does, having an extraordinary protagonist explore an ordinary world. This contemporary realism gives a significance to mundane events experienced by Little Bee, while bringing into focus [...] "sad and ignoble" [...] aspects of English culture such as the detention system. Cleave commented: [...] "We have become accustomed to viewing our own actions in <b>soft</b> <b>focus,</b> but the alien narrator has not yet acquired this cultural immunity.

500|$|The game's humour {{and style}} {{was shaped by}} {{hardware}} limitations; when the hardware rendered the character models in <b>soft</b> <b>focus,</b> the team noted that they resembled Plasticine models, and continued to create {{the game with a}} look and style akin to Wallace and Gromit. The game was presented with [...] "distinctive 'British' humour" [...] to distinguish from other games; lead programmer Leslie Benzies and artist Aaron Garbut often presented the team with other Nintendo 64 games, such as Super Mario 64 (1996), to identify the differences. The team ensured that each level felt distinct, while maintaining a coherent style. This diversity was achieved using the development tools, which allowed various members of the team to experiment in creating designs. Manual text writer Brian Baglow said that the game's music provided freedom to the team, as it [...] "doesn't necessarily have to fit the action on the screen". He explained that the audio was designed to fit with the [...] "cheesy, slightly twisted B-movies animation kind of feel". Baglow found that creating the music on a cartridge instead of a CD prompted the team to discover new techniques of working within the boundaries of the former, stating that [...] "people who are doing music for CD-based systems get very, very lazy".|$|E

As he sings, a black geometric patterned screen comes from behind and engulfs all of the musical devices present. Madonna and Timberlake enter a house but run away from it after finding the screen there, which starts eating the hands and legs of the inhabitants of the house, thus showing their insides. After a number of shots showing Madonna and Timberlake jumping on and over cars to escape from the screen, they finally move into a supermarket. The screen follows them, consuming the long lines of stalls and the people present there. As the second chorus starts, they arrive in front of the screen where Timbaland is singing. After choreographed dancing, Madonna performs a back arch as the timer reaches zero time. The last [...] "tick-tock, tick-tock" [...] sound is heard, Madonna and Timberlake dance again on a long stage; the black screen approaches them from both sides. The video ends with both of them kissing, and the black screen devouring them. Timberlake's bones and ribs, and Madonna's cheeks are seen in the last shot.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Materials that exhibit {{negative}} refraction {{may have}} many novel applications. We seek {{to evaluate the}} possibility of soft-focusing of microwave signals using a medium with an indefinite (hyperbolic) anisotropic permittivity tensor. We fabricated a 147 mm thick and 220 mm wide Styrofoam sample with an embedded array of 12 -gauge brass wires of 6. 35 mm lattice spacing. Two single-loop antennas were used to approximately generate a transverse magnetic (TM) point source and the associated detector. Using an Agilent 8510 C Vector Network Analyzer (VNA), the frequency spectrum was scanned between 7 and 9 GHz. Relative gain or loss measurements were taken at equal spatial steps behind the sample. A scanning robot was used for automatic scanning in the x, y, and z directions, {{in order to establish}} the focusing patterns. The signal amplitudes measured in the presence and absence of the sample were compared. The robot was controlled using LabVIEW†, which also collected the data from the VNA and passed it to MATLAB ‡ for processing. A <b>soft</b> <b>focusing</b> spot was observed when the antennas were placed in two different symmetric configurations with respect to the sample. These results suggest a method for focusing electromagnetic waves using negative refraction in indefinite (hyperbolic) anisotropic materials. 1...|$|R
