ABSTRACT: Republic of Uzbekistan produces more than 3000000 tons of cotton per year, 800000 tons of this harvest is a high quality fiber which is exported to abroad. One of good reason, and global task of production high quality fibre, it is value and request from other countries. A main point of taking high quality fiber depends on previous cultivation. Previous cultivation consists of following technical processes: 1. Cotton transportation from bale with help of air through the pipes. In this process, there is considered three- dimensional transition of various particles of cotton in air streams. In the scientific article, it is theoretically investigated the movement of particles of a cotton in air streams. 2. On factories the cotton is transported through pipelines {{by means of an}} air stream. Cotton getting to a <b>stone</b> <b>catcher</b> is exposed to percussive loading. In this technological process, problems of preservation of natural quality of cotton and seeds are considered. 3. Squashing air from cotton in separator. In this process, a modification air pressure depends on denseness of a stream of cotton. The movement of cotton and air is considered in the form of two component medium. 4. Cotton getting to the chamber of the gin, through teeth of a saw and kolosnic, received considerable loads. Such load...|$|E
50|$|The ancient Hawaiian economy became complex over time. People {{began to}} {{specialize}} in specific skills. Generations of families became committed to certain careers: roof thatchers, house builders, <b>stone</b> grinders, bird <b>catchers</b> who would make the feather cloaks of the alii, canoe builders. Soon, entire islands began {{to specialize in}} certain skilled trades. Oahu became the chief kapa (tapa bark cloth) manufacturer. Maui became the chief canoe manufacturer. The island of Hawaii exchanged bales of dried fish.|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} a computational study of hole transfer (HT) and excess electron transfer (EET) in complexes of a buckyball and a molecular catcher having two concave buckybowls as described by Sygula et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007, 129, 3842). Three systems are considered:[*] (1) the inclusion complex consisting of the fullerene and catcher subunits, (2) a system formed by two catchers, and (3) a supermolecular system consisting of two fullerene and two catcher molecules. Such a type of organic system is of potential interest {{in the design of}} nanoelectronic devices. HT and EET electronic couplings of the subunits in the systems are calculated using the HF/ 6 - 31 G* method and the semiempirical INDO/S scheme; the calculation of the reorganization energy is carried out within the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G* method. On the basis of the computed values of electronic couplings and reorganization energies, we predict that excess charge (hole or electron) should be strongly confined to a single subunit in the complexes. Then, we suggest that excess charge propagation within the fullerene-catcher system in the solid state occurs as superexchange mediated hopping; in this process, fullerene molecules function as stepping <b>stones,</b> while the <b>catcher</b> effectively mediates the charge transport between buckyballs. The properties of the buckycatcher, acting as a charge-transfer mediator from and to fullerenes, are found to be quite different for electron- and hole-transfer processes. We estimate the absolute rate of the hole and the excess electron hopping between fullerenes, kHT = 1. 28 1012 s- 1, while kEET = 1. 07 109 s- 1 and find that the HT is much faster than the EET because of (1) the stronger HT coupling between neighboring buckybowls of the catchers and (2) the smaller HT reorganization energy relative to that for EETThis work has been supported by Project No. CTQ 2005 - 04563 of the Spanish Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia (MEC...|$|R
