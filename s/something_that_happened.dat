25|$|Kabuki {{became a}} {{common form of}} {{entertainment}} in the ukiyo, or Yoshiwara, the registered red-light district in Edo. A diverse crowd gathered under one roof, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> nowhere else in the city. Kabuki theaters were a place to see and be seen as they featured the latest fashion trends and current events. The stage provided good entertainment with exciting new music, patterns, clothing, and famous actors. Performances went from morning until sunset. The teahouses surrounding or connected to the theater provided meals, refreshments, and good company. The area around the theatres was lush with shops selling kabuki souvenirs. Kabuki, in a sense, initiated pop culture in Japan.|$|E
25|$|During his career, Houston {{was known}} for his three-point {{shooting}} prowess. Despite the on-court accolades, though, Houston's lasting legacy may be <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> off the court: In 2001, Houston signed a six-year, $100.4 million contract extension with the Knicks. Houston's yearly salary of over $20 million made him virtually untradeable, and his injury problems would burden the Knicks. Houston missed 32 games in 2003-04 due to a knee injury, and despite claims in the summer of 2004 that he would be ready to play the next season (he even refused to have surgery on his knee that summer), he played in only 20 games that season because his injury had not completely healed. Knee injuries would eventually force Houston to announce his retirement on October 17, 2005.|$|E

Matt Rollings provided both the piano and its arrangements, as well as playing the Hammond B-3; Lee Levin performed the drums and percussion instruments while Briang Lang provided the bass. Jason Birchmeier from Allmusic praised the song, stating that it [...] "pack a punch."

50|$|The {{event was}} {{originally}} called AfrikaBurns, however owing to {{concerns about the}} name having possible negative connotations there was a public call for proposals on 15 May 2008. On 16 July 2008 the new name, AfrikaBurn, was officially announced via email.

500|$|It {{was very}} exciting. I got {{to write the}} attack {{at the end of}} the episode—which was very much <b>{{something}}</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> in the comic book series—so I knew I would be revisiting something I had already written. But as we were in the writers' room, when things started shifting which led to all this new stuff that wasn't in the comic book series, I thought that was great because it wasn't me writing the same-old same-old or rewriting something I had already done and trying to make it interesting for myself. It was really an entirely new story: getting the gang members in there and getting to write Daryl [...] which is one of my favorite characters on the show, despite the fact that he’s not in the comic book. It was a blast.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, {{the first}} {{official}} tie-in comic was released. Quesada outlined his plan to expand the MCU into comic books, saying, [...] "The MCU [...] {{are going to be}} stories set within movie continuity.

Kevin Feige is involved with these and in some cases maybe the writers of the movies would be involved [...] " [...] Marvel Comics worked with Brad Winderbaum, Jeremy Latcham, and Will Corona Pilgrim at Marvel Studios to decide which concepts should be carried over from the Marvel Comics Universe to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, what to show in the tie-in comics, and what to leave for the films. Marvel has clarified which of the tie-in comics are considered official canonical MCU stories, with the rest merely inspired by the MCU, [...] "where we get to show off all the characters from the film in costume and in comic form." ...|$|E
500|$|Shilts {{decided to}} write And the Band Played On after {{attending}} an awards ceremony in 1983 where he was to receive a commendation for his coverage on AIDS. As described in the book, television announcer Bill Kurtis gave the keynote address and told a joke: [...] "What's the hardest part about having AIDS? Trying to convince your wife that you're Haitian." [...] Shilts responded to the joke by saying that it [...] "says everything about how the media had dealt with AIDS. Bill Kurtis felt that he could go {{in front of a}} journalists' group in San Francisco and make AIDS jokes. First of all, he could assume that nobody there would be gay and, if they were gay, they wouldn't talk about it and that nobody would take offense at that. To me, that summed up the whole problem of dealing with AIDS in the media. Obviously, the reason I covered AIDS from the start was that, to me, it was never <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> to those other people." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The One with All the Thanksgivings" [...] {{was written}} by Gregory S. Malins and {{directed}} by Kevin S. Bright. It is the fifth Thanksgiving special in the Friends series. The producers knew from past recordings that the audience responded well to seeing [...] "the Friends as they were" [...] and decided to incorporate a flashback episode into a Thanksgiving special. Show creator David Crane considered the Thanksgiving-themed episode as the [...] "hallmark show" [...] in each season. Marta Kauffman added dialogue centering on six characters being together in a room made the holiday special work. When discussing story ideas, the writers decided to create [...] "a bunch of little pieces", until someone suggested [...] "what if it's the worst Thanksgivings?", later used as the hook. Working on a flashback meant the episode needed [...] "to have meaning" [...] as the story continues in the present. It was difficult to keep the characters, particularly Chandler, spontaneously mad for <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> [...] "years ago". The comedic content was bigger than usual, because Phoebe's arm was blown off and Joey's head stuck in a turkey.|$|E

Sometimes you just realize it", he has since explained. Before his marriage, he met Renée Zellweger while filming Case 39 in 2006.

Cooper began a relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk the following month. In November, he moved into her apartment in New York's West Village. In March 2017, Shayk gave birth to their daughter.|$|E

Her ex-boyfriend Adam (Vlach Ashton) warned Jake that Loretta had previously stalked him. This starts to damage their relationship and during an interview with What's on TV Walton commented on it saying that Jake was suspicious of Loretta's motives. Loretta love for Jake turned into an obsession with Walton saying, [...] "She's definitely not giving up on him. What he thought was love is already actually an obsession. She wants to totally control him". The story line reveals her past of obsessions with men and Walton stated, [...] "You sense Adam wasn't the only ex-partner she stalked. She has a mobile full of men's numbers." [...] Walton explains the cause of her behaviour, [...] "You find out much later on that it's because of <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> in her past. Her obsession really is getting full-on [...] She's jealous of anybody who gets Jake's attention." [...] After Jake's sister Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson) is diagnosed with cervical cancer Loretta pretends she once had leukaemia in order to trap Jake. He throws her out though because his son had previously suffered from the illness. Loretta refuses {{to give up and}} her behaviour becomes more erratic.|$|E

500|$|Churches of Christ {{consistently}} {{teach that}} in baptism a believer surrenders {{his life in}} faith and obedience to God, and that God [...] "by the merits of Christ's blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes {{the state of the}} person from an alien to a citizen of God's kingdom. Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do." [...] Baptism is a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it [...] "is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God". While Churches of Christ do not describe baptism as a [...] "sacrament", their view of it can legitimately be described as [...] "sacramental". They see the power of baptism coming from God, who chose to use baptism as a vehicle, rather than from the water or the act itself, and understand baptism to {{be an integral part of}} the conversion process, rather than as only a symbol of conversion. A recent trend is to emphasize the transformational aspect of baptism: instead of describing it as nothing more than a legal requirement or sign of <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> in the past, it is seen as [...] "the event that places the believer 'into Christ' where God does the ongoing work of transformation". There is a minority that downplays the importance of baptism in order to avoid sectarianism, but the broader trend is to [...] "reexamine the richness of the Biblical teaching of baptism and to reinforce its central and essential place in Christianity".|$|E
500|$|Lindelof {{stated that}} [...] "When season five starts, you won't know when or where you are. [...] And {{the way we}} tell stories will be {{different}} too", and confirmed that the [...] "whooshing sound" [...] effect {{will continue to be}} used as the transition for the new storytelling device. [...] When asked if episodes continue to focus on specific and different characters, actor Jorge Garcia, who portrays Hurley Reyes, replied that [...] "It's not as clear cut as it's been in the past. We don't have the moments where someone stares off into space and then we cut to <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> in their previous life. [...] They've gone in a slightly different direction as far as how they're telling the story and they're definitely trying to show what's going on with more people in every given episode." [...] The script included scenes with all the main characters, including Desmond in the ending, because the writers felt that after a long break the audience would like to see every character again. Like the previous three season openers, the opening scene was meant to make viewers [...] "not supposed to have any sense of where and when we are". But while the other premieres had the teaser connecting into the main plot of the episode, the writers decided to put a scene that would only return in the fourteenth episode, [...] "The Variable". The time flashes were designed in a way that demonstrated both the castaways at the beach and John Locke in the jungle were [...] "skipping" [...] to the same time periods, and also to show that time travel was painful for the characters.|$|E

Ron discovers Leslie and Ben's affair after they accidentally pocket dial him while sexually role-playing with political figures. At one point, Leslie tells Ben she is going to kiss him both like former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Ruth Bader Ginsburg. At another, Ben impersonates former President Ronald Reagan, which prompts Leslie, pretending to be United Kingdom Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to say, [...] "Oh, President Reagan, my blazer popped open." [...] In a different scene, Andy seeks to write a song for Li'l Sebastian that is 5,000 times better than Elton John's [...] "Candle in the Wind", which inspires him to write the original song [...] "5,000 Candles in the Wind". Other songs played during Li'l Sebastian's memorial service include [...] "Wild Horses" [...] by The Rolling Stones and [...] "A Horse with No Name" [...] by America. In an attempt to explain to someone that she and Ben were hugging, Leslie explains she recently won a McArthur Genius Grant and that Ben was simply congratulating her. In addition, during Tom and Jean-Ralphio's eulogy presentation for Lil' Sebastian, a still of the Trifid Nebula in Sagittarius is seen.

Shortly after becoming Minister of Health, Powell asked Rab Butler, then Home Secretary, if he could become appointed to the minister committee which checked on immigration and was about to be re-constituted. Powell was worried about the strain by NHS immigrants and papers show that he wanted a stronger restriction on Commonwealth immigration than what was passed in 1961.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his career, Mahal has {{performed}} his brand of blues (an African American artform) for {{a predominantly white}} audience. This has been a disappointment at times for Mahal, who recognizes {{there is a general}} lack of interest in blues music among many African Americans today. He has drawn a parallel comparison between the blues and rap music in that they both were initially black forms of music that have come to be assimilated into the mainstream of society. He is quoted as saying, [...] "Eighty-one percent of the kids listening to rap were not black kids. Once there was a tremendous amount of money involved in it... they totally moved it over to a material side. It just went off to a terrible direction." [...] Mahal also believes that some people may think the blues are about wallowing in negativity and despair, a position he disagrees with. According to him, [...] "You can listen to my music from front to back, and you don't ever hear me moaning and crying about how bad you done treated me.
