40|$|The Bologna {{declaration}} {{stresses the}} importance of education and educational co-operation in the development and strengthening of stable, peaceful and democratic societies. Additionally the declaration highlights the need to promote European co-operation in quality assurance with a view to develop comparable criteria and methodologies. The cooperative activity of universities created preconditions for students' mobility under the Leonardo da Vinci and <b>Socrates</b> <b>programmes.</b> Hence, a comparison of efficiency of engineering education studies at partner institutions has become a topical issue. The paper presents the problems related to engineering education quality at different universities and suggests a system of indicators that are applicable for education quality estimation. The main idea is to compare the distinguished aspects of the education process and to evaluate quality of teaching. The efficiency of different subjects (social and engineering) is estimated by applying sets of criteria, to be implemented by incorporating a proposed system of criteria into questionnaires for students at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU), who participate in student mobility programmes. Processing of the received responses let the author achieve the ultimate aim, i. e. to trace differences in the quality of teaching.

40|$|Despite {{a massive}} {{expansion}} {{of education in}} Portugal, since the 1970 ’s, educational attainment {{of the adult population}} in the country remains low. The numbers of working-age people in some form of continuing education are among the lowest, according to the OECD and EU- 27 statistics. Technological Schools(TS), initially created in the 1990 ’s, under the umbrella of the Ministry of Economy in partnership with industry and industrial associations, aimed to prepare qualified staff for industries and services in the country, particularly in the engineering sector, through the provision of post secondary non-university programmes of studies, the CET (Technological Specialization Courses). Successful CET students are awarded a DET(Diploma of Technological Specialization), which corresponds to Vocational Qualification level IV of the EU, according to the latest alteration (2005) of the Education Systems Act (introduced in 1986). In this, CET’s are also clearly defined as one of the routes for access to Higher Education (HE), in Portugal. The PRILHE (Promoting Reflective and Independent Learning in Higher Education) multinational project, funded by the European <b>Socrates</b> Grundtvig <b>Programme,</b> aimed to identify the learning processes which enable adult students in higher education to become autonomous reflective learners and search best practices to support these learning processes. During this research, both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to determine how students organise their studies and develop their learning skills. The Portuguese partner in the project’ consortium used a two case studies approach, one with students of Higher Education Institutions and other with students of TS. This paper only applies to students of TS, as these have a predominant bias towards engineering. Results show that student motivation and professional teaching support contribute equally to the development of an autonomous and reflective approach to learning in adult students; this is essential for success in a knowledge economy, where lifelong learning is the key to continuous employment...|$|R

She {{emphasize}} in {{her article}} that the organization should adopt the education as a life style and transform them to learning organization. This situation is current for educational organizations. The societies of today need the individuals {{who know how to}} reach knowledge, how to convert the gained knowledge to the behaviors, how to produce new knowledge using them. For growing up the individuals who have these characteristics, educational organizations have to transform to learning organizations. In this process, the teachers also have important role. So this the reason that she realized a descriptive study, by aiming to determine whether the schools of education have the learning organization features. The thirteenth one about is “Distance Education as a Women Empowerment Strategy in Africa”, written by Felix Kayode OLAKULEHIN and Olugbenga David OJO from National Open University of Nigeria, Lagos, Nigeria. According to them; women emancipation through empowerment all over the world is at its peak and Africans generally are not left out. It is an attempt to make sure that women’s voices are heard and are given their right places in the scheme of things. Therefore, this paper stresses the use of open and distance institution in Nigeria as an avenue to attain knowledge and education that would put women in a better stead toward achieving their aims and aspirations.

And, the fifteenth as the latest article which is from United Kingdom which was titled as “Theories of Learning and Their Implications for On-Line Assessment”, written By Anthony Francis UNDERHILL, BA MA Cert. Ed ILTM, University of Central England, Birmingham. This paper briefly reviews the theories of learning and their relationship with traditional forms of assessment and seeks to argue for the need to further develop online assessment tools to further facilitate the growth in process based learning activities such as collaborative and cooperative group work consistent with a socio-constructivist pedagogy. Four book reviews were on “Authentic Learning Environments in Higher Education”, edited by Edited by Anthony Herrington and Jan Herrington and, published by Information Science Publishing in 2005. Other one is “Online Assessment, Measurement and Evaluation Case Studies from Higher Education, K- 12 and Corporate”, “Online assessment, measurement and evaluation”. These three books reviewed by Dr. Adnan BOYACI, Anadolu University, Eskisehir-TURKEY. And “Global Peace through the Global University System”, edited by Edited by Tapio Varis, Takeshi Utsumi, William Klemm, 2003, published Research Centre for Vocational Education (RCVE) and reviewed by Reviewed by Dr. Cengiz Hakan AYDIN, Anadolu University, and Eskisehir-TURKEY. Reviewer Dr. Boyaci indicates in his review that “Authentic learning has been growing in importance and popularity as a learning approach for last decade. One of the critical reasons of this growing importance depends on the fact that traditional university education do not result in appropriate learning outcomes. Especially increasing popularity and influence of constructivism as a philosophical approach to learning have accelerated the research studies and papers investigating alternative models of teaching and learning, which has resulted in that authentic learning, has emerged as a challenge to existing learning environment. However implementation of authentic learning in higher education executed face to face and/or technology mediated courses such as online subjects has still been arbitrary and undefined. Thus rich variety of examples of authentic learning environments found in this book will contribute the readers with the inspiration to teach their subjects and courses in ways that reflect the authenticity. ” Online Assessment, Measurement and Evaluation Case Studies from Higher Education, K- 12 and Corporate is edited by David D. Williams and Marry Hricko and published by Information Science Publishing, 2006. The book has eighteen chapters divided into three sections which underline three broad educational and training areas, namely elementary and secondary (K 12), higher education and corporate. In addition to section of authors’ biography contributing the book and an index, there is a preface in which chapters of the book are shortly introduced. Besides two editors, forty-seven authors have contributed to the book. Contributions of authors having different backgrounds and institutions enable the book to have very comprehensive spectrum and this makes the book attractive practically for those having different kinds of practice, problems and point of views. Online Assessment, Measurement and Evaluation Emerging Practices Edited by David D. Williams, Scott L. Howell and Marry Hricko, published by Information Science Publishing for 2006. Online assessment, measurement and evaluation have emerged as a new domain challenging process of education and educators in the twenty-first century. As the improvements in online technologies have provided new tools, the vision of traditional methodologies and principles used in assessment, measurement and evaluation has also been challenged. In this sense there is a crucial need to make clarify the concepts, issues and systems involved in this new challenging domain of assessment, measurement and evaluation. This book provides coherent point of view to online assessment, measurement and evaluation Another book, Global Peace through the Global University System is a collection of papers presented in working conference on the Global University System (GUS) hosted by the University of Tampere, Finland in 1999. The main goal of the conference was bringing international experts to share their philosophy, past and present experiences about the GUS. The conference was held by the University of Tampere because UNESCO has an agreement with the University to establish the UNESCO Chair in Global e-Learning.
