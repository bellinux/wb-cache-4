40|$|Background: Obesity {{represents}} the systemic condition capable of influencing the onset and progression of periodontal disease. Obesity {{is associated with}} oxidative stress. Plasma level of reactive oxidative metabolites (ROMs) is measured {{as an indicator of}} oxidative stress in the body. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess and compare the plasma ROM levels in obese <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> healthy and inflammatory periodontal status. Materials and Methods: Sixty subjects selected were grouped as 15 obese or overweight <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> generalized chronic periodontitis, 15 obese or overweight <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> generalized chronic gingivitis, 15 obese or overweight <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> healthy periodontium, and 15 nonobese and healthy periodontium. The clinical periodontal parameters such as plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth, and clinical attachment level were measured. Blood samples were obtained to measure the plasma levels of ROM. Result and Conclusion: In this study, obese <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> chronic periodontitis (Group I) had mean plasma ROM levels (442. 3 ± 15. 65 Carratelli unit [CARR U]) showing 100 % <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> high oxidative stress. Obese <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> chronic gingivitis (Group II) had mean plasma ROM levels (358. 7 ± 20. 61 CARR U) indicating 86. 7 % <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> oxidative stress. Obese <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> healthy periodontium (Group III) had 46. 7 % <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> slight oxidative stress, and the mean ROM level was 320. 2 ± 17. 57. Nonobese <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> healthy periodontium (Group IV) had 80 % of <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> normal oxidative stress and the mean plasma ROM level was 296. 9 ± 20. 35 CARR U. The intra- and inter-group comparison showed significant difference (P < 0. 001). From our study, we report that obese <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> periodontitis have more oxidative stress compared to obese <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> healthy periodontium...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with cystic {{fibrosis}} have altered levels of plasma fatty acids. We previously demonstrated that arachidonic acid levels are increased and docosahexaenoic acid levels are decreased in affected tissues from {{cystic fibrosis}}-knockout mice. In {{this study we}} determined whether humans with mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene have a similar fatty acid defect in tissues expressing CFTR. METHODS: Fatty acids from nasal- and rectal-biopsy specimens, nasal epithelial scrapings, and plasma were analyzed from 38 <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> cystic fibrosis and compared with results in 13 obligate heterozygotes, 24 healthy controls, 11 <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> inflammatory bowel disease, 9 <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> upper respiratory tract infection, and 16 <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> asthma. RESULTS: The ratio of arachidonic to docosahexaenoic acid was increased in mucosal and submucosal nasal-biopsy specimens (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and rectal-biopsy specimens (P= 0. 009) from <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> cystic fibrosis and pancreatic sufficiency and <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency, as compared with values in healthy control subjects. In nasal tissue, this change reflected an increase in arachidonic acid levels {{and a decrease in}} docosahexaenoic acid levels. In cells from nasal mucosa, the ratio of arachidonic to docosahexaenoic acid was increased in <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> cystic fibrosis (P 3 ̆c 0. 001), as compared with healthy controls, with values in obligate heterozygotes intermediate between these two groups (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). The ratio was not increased in <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> inflammatory bowel disease. <b>Subjects</b> <b>with</b> asthma and those with upper respiratory tract infection had values intermediate between those in <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> cystic fibrosis and those in healthy control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that alterations in fatty acids similar to those in cystic fibrosis-knockout mice are present in CFTR-expressing tissue from <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> cystic fibrosis...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{present study}} aimed to 1) assess facial {{expression}} recognition in <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> a previous history of {{major depressive disorder}} relative to <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> no history of depression and 2) characterize the effects of acute citalopram infusion on recognition performance for both groups.

RESULTS: Following saline infusion, <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> a previous history of depression showed a selectively greater recognition of fear relative to the <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> no history of depression. The abnormal fear processing observed in the <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> a previous history of depression was normalized following citalopram infusion, an effect that was opposite to that seen <b>with</b> the <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> no history of depression.

5|$|At Kelmscott Press the {{perfection}} of book-making was under his constant supervision and practical assistance. It was his ambition to produce a perfect work to restore all the beauty of illuminated lettering, richness of gilding and grace of binding that {{used to make a}} volume the treasure of a king. His efforts were constantly directed towards giving the world at least one book that exceeded anything that had ever appeared. Morris designed his type after the best examples of early printers, what he called his “golden type” which he copied after Jenson, Parautz, Coburger and others. With this in mind, Morris took equal care on the choice of his paper which he adapted to his <b>subject</b> <b>with</b> the same care that governed his selection of material for binding. As a result, few but only the wealthy could purchase his lavish works, mainly due to how intrinsic his work was.

5|$|Luther {{broached}} the <b>subject</b> <b>with</b> Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, who was simultaneously developing a similar scheme. By 18 June, Hitler and Ribbentrop {{spoke of the}} Plan with Italian leader Benito Mussolini as a possibility that could be pursued after the defeat of France. Once he learned of the plan, SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), insisted that Ribbentrop relinquish any future responsibility for the Plan to that office. As Heydrich had been appointed by Göring in January 1939 to oversee Jewish evacuation from German-occupied territory, the Jewish question was hence under his purview. Adolf Eichmann, head of the RSHA Sub-Department IV-B4, which dealt with Jewish affairs and evacuation, soon became involved. On 15 August, he released a memorandum titled Reichssicherheitshauptamt: Madagaskar Projekt (Reich Main Security Office: Madagascar Project), calling for the resettlement of a million Jews per year {{for four years and}} abandoning the idea of retaining any Jews in Europe. The RSHA, he emphasized, would control all aspects of the program. While Rademacher called for the colony to be under German control but self-governing under Jewish administration, Eichmann made it plain that he intended for the SS to control and oversee every aspect of life on the island, which they would govern as a police state.|$|E

40|$|Thirty-two <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> {{impaired}} {{fasting glucose}} (IFG) and 28 <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> normal fasting glucose (NFG) ingested a labeled meal and 75 g glucose (oral glucose tolerance test) on separate occasions. Fasting glucose, insulin, and C-peptide were higher (P < 0. 05) in <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> IFG than in those with NFG, whereas endogenous glucose production (EGP) did not differ, indicating hepatic insulin resistance. EGP was promptly suppressed, and meal glucose appearance comparably increased following meal ingestion in both groups. In contrast, glucose disappearance (R(d)) immediately after meal ingestion was lower (P < 0. 001) in <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> IFG/impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and IFG/diabetes but {{did not differ in}} <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> IFG/normal glucose tolerance (NGT) or NFG/NGT. Net insulin action (S(i)) and insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (S(i) *) were reduced (P < 0. 001, ANOVA) in <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> NFG/IGT, IFG/IGT, and IFG/diabetes but did not differ in <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> NFG/NGT or IFG/NGT. Defective insulin secretion also contributed to lower postprandial R(d) since disposition indexes were lower (P < 0. 001, ANOVA) in <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> NFG/IGT, IFG/IGT, and IFG/diabetes but did not differ in <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> NFG/NGT and IFG/NGT. We conclude that postprandial hyperglycemia in individuals with early diabetes is due to lower rates of glucose disappearance rather than increased meal appearance or impaired suppression of EGP, regardless of their fasting glucose. In contrast, insulin secretion, action, and the pattern of postprandial turnover are essentially normal in individuals with isolated IFG...|$|R
5|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} controversy of Sanford's presidency was {{his effort to}} establish the presidential library of former US President Richard Nixon at Duke. Sanford raised the <b>subject</b> <b>with</b> Nixon {{during a visit to}} the former president at Nixon's New York City office on July 28, 1981. Sanford continued to seek Nixon's advice on multiple issues within the months that followed. The library proposal became public in mid-August, creating considerable controversy at the university. Though Sanford enjoyed some support for his effort, most of the faculty were against the proposal, the largest concern being that the facility would be a monument to Nixon rather than a center of study. Sanford tried to engineer a compromise, but the proposal by the Duke Academic Council of a library only a third the size of that which Nixon wanted and their rejection of a Nixon museum to accompany it, ultimately led Nixon to decline Sanford's offer and site his library in the city of his birth, Yorba Linda, California, instead; it was dedicated there in 1990.|$|E

40|$|Aims: {{the main}} purpose of this thesis was to {{estimate}} the prevalence of Usher syndrome type I, II and III in Sweden (study I) and to determine the clinical differences between Usher syndrome subtypes (studies II-IV). The hypothesis to be tested was that different genes for Usher syndrome will produce different phenotypes even when they belong to the same clinical type (studies II and III). Material and Methods: study I: <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> Usher syndrome were ascertained through multiple sources in Sweden. Study II: in total 167 <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> Usher type II participated in this study. Data were obtained from Sweden (116) and from the USA (51). Study III: twenty-eight <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> Usher syndrome type III (USH 3) participated. Study IV: 145 <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> Usher I and 183 <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> Usher II were evaluated in this study. Study subjects were included in these studies based on clinical findings of retinitis pigmentosa, sensorineural hearing loss and in some subjects, vestibular areflexia and genetic evaluations (studies I-IV). Results: in total 293 <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> Usher syndrome were identified. The prevalence of Usher syndrome in Sweden was estimated to 1. 6, 1. 4 and 0. 3 / 100. 000 for type I, II and III respectively. The prevalence of Usher I was found to be significantly higher (8. 6 / 100. 000) in the two northernmost counties (Study I). Study II: the hearing loss in <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> Usher IIA was found to be more severe and the progression started earlier than in non-IIA (IIB and IIC). Study III: progression of hearing loss in <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> Usher III (USH 3) begins early and approximately 50 % of subjects become profoundly deaf by the age of 40 years. Various vestibular abnormalities were found in about 50 % of the tested <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> USH 3. Study IV: visual acuity and visual field loss in <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> Usher syndrome type I and II was both progressive and permanent. <b>Subjects</b> <b>with</b> Usher I was seen to be more visually impaired than <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> Usher II. Occurrence of cataract was slightly more common in <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> Usher I than in <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> Usher II. Conclusions: clinical and phenotype-genotype correlation studies such as those performed in this thesis are necessary to obtain correct clinical diagnosis. The results show that affected <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> identical genotype had different expressions of the disease, even when they are from the same family maybe because of other environmental and genetic modifiers. The results will also open new possibilities for investigating the etiology, pathogenesis, clinical expression, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of Usher syndrome...|$|R

40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} implicated {{periodontal}} disease (PD) as {{a risk factor}} for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). These studies addressed the premise that local infection may perturb the levels of systemic inflammatory mediators, thereby promoting mechanisms of atherosclerosis. Levels of inflammatory mediators in the sera of <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> only PD, only CVD, both diseases, or neither condition were compared. Subjects were assessed for levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), ceruloplasmin, α 1 -acid-glycoprotein (AAG), α 1 -antichymotrypsin (ACT), and the soluble cellular adhesion molecules sICAM- 1 and sVCAM by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent and/or radial immunodiffusion assays. CRP levels in <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> either condition alone were elevated twofold above <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> neither disease, whereas a threefold increase was noted in <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> both diseases (P = 0. 0389). Statistically significant increases in SAA and ACT were noted in <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> both conditions compared to those with one or neither condition (P = 0. 0162 and 0. 0408, respectively). Ceruloplasmin levels were increased in <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> only CVD (P = 0. 0001). Increases in sVCAM levels were noted in all <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> CVD (P = 0. 0054).
