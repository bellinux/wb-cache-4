40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{vascular}} cambium is discussed {{and the length of}} the elements in the secondary xylem related to the division and elongation cycles of the cambial fusiform initials. Particular attention is given to the activities of the <b>storeyed</b> <b>cambium.</b> The ontogeny of the <b>storeyed</b> <b>cambium</b> is described for Hoheria angustifolia Raoul. (Malvaceae). The transition from procambium to cambium was found to take place gradually, the meristem acquiring cambial characteristics over a number of internodes, some before and some after internodal elongation had ceased. The cambium is non storeyed at the commencement of secondary growth but later develops a storeyed pattern. Developmental changes in the cambium with radial growth were studied in Aeschynomene hispida Willd. (Papilionaceae). Repeated radial longitudinal divisions in the fusiform cambial initials in this plant produce a highly developed storeyed pattern with radial growth. The frequency of these divisions decreases with increasing distance from the stem centre. The mean length of the fusiform initials decreases slightly with radial growth. Variation {{in the size of the}} fusiform initials and vessel members was also investigated in Hoberia angustifolia. Mean length of the fusiform initials was found to remain constant with increasing distance from the stem centre but a slight decrease was observed with increasing height in the tree. Mean fusiform initial width showed an increase followed by a decrease with increasing height in the tree. The significance of these results is related to the division pattern in the <b>storeyed</b> <b>cambium...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of interlocked grain, generated by <b>storeyed</b> <b>cambium,</b> {{was observed in}} the wood of linden. The inclination of the grain changed periodically every two to four years. In general, {{the direction of the}} change of grain was compatible with the {{occurrence of}} configuration Z or S of cellular events. 1 f, in the cambium during the generation of a growth ring, the domain border did not pass the examined area, the events were of one configuration type only, otherwise, there were two types of events aggregated into microareas. The microareas were the result of unsynchronous activities of groups of cambium cells. A growth ring area through which a domain border passed during the year under consideration was called the transition area...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{restructuring}} of the cellular arrangement, rays in <b>storeyed</b> <b>cambium</b> undergo transformations, that is, uniting and splitting on the borders of storeys, when their height during development exceeds that of the storeys of fusiform cells. The primordial rays on the cambium surface have a non-storeyed arrangement. Prolonged predominance of splitting over uniting {{can lead to a}} situation in which the height of the rays does not exceed that of fusiform cell storeys. A storeyed arrangement of rays is thus formed. The maintenance of a given arrangement of rays in successive annual growths is the result of the cumulation of several traits, such as: 1) the seriation of rays, 2) the magnitude of grain inclination, 3) the rate of the {{restructuring of}} the cell arrangement. For example, the quicker a storeyed arrangement of rays will be formed the less the rays are seriated, the quicker the cells are restructured and the greater the inclination of their arrangement. The magnitude of the inclination of the grain and the rate of cell restructuring are traits connected with the arrangement of fusiform cells. The seriate nature of rays, however, is characteristic of rays and, moreover, it is a characteristic individual trait. It seems that the seriation of rays can play a valuable role in taxonomic analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of the <b>storeyed</b> pattern of <b>cambium</b> {{in the first two}} years of cambial activity and the structure of mature cambium was examined in Laburnum anagyroides, a decorative shrub growing in temperate climate. A distinct storeyed pattern was observed in two-year-old stems, despite the presence of tall rays. The heterogeneous nature of storeys was revealed by the analysis of i) the number of fusiform initials forming storeys or groups of packets; and ii) the frequency of anticlinal divisions in the examined years of cambial activity and the calculation of the relative increase of the cambial circumference. The results are discussed on the basis of the recent hypothesis of intrusive growth of fusiform initial, occurring between the tangential walls of its neighbouring initial and its closest derivative...|$|R
