50|$|A wound-rotor motor {{can be used}} {{in several}} forms of adjustable-speed drive. Certain types of variable-speed drives recover slip-frequency power from the rotor circuit and feed it back to the supply, {{allowing}} wide speed range with high energy efficiency. Doubly fed electric machines use the slip rings to supply external power to the rotor circuit, allowing wide-range speed control. Today speed control by use of <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> <b>motor</b> is mostly superseded by induction motors with variable-frequency drives.|$|E
50|$|Compared to a {{squirrel-cage}} rotor, {{the rotor}} of the <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> <b>motor</b> has more winding turns; the induced voltage is then higher, {{and the current}} lower, than for a squirrel-cage rotor. During the start-up a typical rotor has 3 poles connected to the slip ring. Each pole is wired in series with a variable power resistor. When the motor reaches full speed the rotor poles are switched to short circuit. During start-up the resistors reduce the field strength at the stator. As a result the inrush current is reduced. Another important advantage over squirrel-cage motors is higher starting torque.|$|E
5000|$|Before the {{development}} of semiconductor power electronics, {{it was difficult to}} vary the frequency, and cage induction motors were mainly used in fixed speed applications. Applications such as electric overhead cranes used DC drives or wound rotor motors (WRIM) with slip rings for rotor circuit connection to variable external resistance allowing considerable range of speed control. However, resistor losses associated with low speed operation of WRIMs is a major cost disadvantage, especially for constant loads. [...] Large <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> <b>motor</b> drives, termed slip energy recovery systems, some still in use, recover energy from the rotor circuit, rectify it, and return it to the power system using a VFD.|$|E

40|$|In the 1970 s {{the sugar}} {{industry}} began {{moving away from}} steam turbine driven shredders in favour of electric motor drives. Due to the high inertias of the shredders, long starting times and high starting torque requirements, the preferred electric motor drives have been <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> <b>motors</b> with liquid starters. With the demand for higher Preparation Indices the shredder motor powers gradually increased. These ever-larger motors together with the power swings generally associated with shredders began to impact negatively on the sugar mill power houses and {{had the potential to}} cause loss of synchronism of the TAs and factory blackouts. The accepted solution was to engineer an increase in the rotor resistance and thus motor slip in order to relieve the stress on the power supply of the large power swings. Increasing motor slip is easily carried out with <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> <b>motors</b> and external wire wound resistances left in the rotor circuit during normal running. This solution has been the standard adopted in virtually all new southern African mills from then to the present day. Pressure is being brought to bear by the large motor manufacturers in that <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> <b>motors</b> and liquid starter applications are falling out of favour and being replaced with reliable, medium voltage, variable speed drives connected to robust, simple and low maintenance squirrel cage motors. The sugar industry needs to keep up with this technology and take advantage of less expensive, more reliable shredder drive designs...|$|R

So, in addition to conventional power generation units a large no. of renewable energy units are being integrated into the power system. A wind electrical generation system is the most cost competitive, environmentally clean and safe out of all the renewable energy sources. The recent evolution of power semiconductors and variable frequency drive technology has aided the acceptance of variable speed generation systems. <b>Slip</b> <b>ring</b> induction <b>motor</b> in the variable speed double fed induction generator mode is largely used in wind turbine generation technology. Therefore, a detailed model of induction generator is presented in the thesis. Then the induction generator is operated at different operating conditions and the results are presented in the thesis. A hardware set up is build up to estimate the different circuit parameter under different operating conditions. Speed, torque, Active and reactive power estimation are proposed in the thesis with the help of hardware set-up. Because these are the controllable parameter and they determine the machine performance. So, by estimating these parameter our future aim is to manipulate those parameter and to design a closed loop controller for DFIG. This study is relevant as DFIG-wind turbines are an integrated part of Distributed generation system. Any abnormalities associated with grid are going to affect the system performance considerably. Taking this into account, the performance of double fed induction generator (DFIG) variable speed wind turbine under network fault or under dynamic loading is studied.

40|$|The Seasat {{spacecraft}} failed on October 9, 1978, after satisfactory {{operation in}} orbit for 105 days, {{as a result}} of a loss of electrical power in the Agena bus that was used as a part of the spacecraft. This loss of power was caused by a massive and progressive short in one of the <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assemblies that was used to connect the rotating solar arrays into the power subsystem. The most likely cause of this short was the initiation of an arc between adjacent <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> brush assemblies. The triggering mechanism of this arc could have been either a wire-to-brush assembly contact, a brush-to-brush contact, or a momentary short caused by a contaminant that bridged internal components of opposite electrical polarity. The <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly, as used in the Seasat spacecraft, was connected into the power subsystem in such a way that most of the adjacent brush assemblies were of opposite electrical polarity.
