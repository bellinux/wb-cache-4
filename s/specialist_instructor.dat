50|$|In 1939 SME mobilised {{again and}} the Training Battalion left Chatham forming two {{training}} battalions at Harper Barracks Ripon and Shorncliffe Army Camp.Young Officer training was cut short to allow the officers to be dispatched to units. No basic training was now done at Chatham since the officers were trained at the RE OCTU and the men were to be trained in the training battalions. <b>Specialist,</b> <b>instructor</b> and higher trade continued at Chatham but from June 1940 training was seriously interrupted by German efforts to destroy the dockyard. Approximately 100 bombs, and one Spitfire, fell on the SME damaging buildings including the Commandant's residence. One caused heavy casualties when it burst {{in the basement of}} a barrack block. Staff and students were also required to direct the building of defences in the dockyard and the surrounding area. It was difficult to continue trainingunder these circumstances so it was decided to look for a new site for SME. In September 1940 the decision was taken to move to Ripon. Despite the disruptions caused by the move, only one month's training was lost. Trade training remained at Chatham throughout the war due to the difficulty of finding suitable workshops elsewhere. The school at Ripon was expanded to keep pace with the growing demands of the war. In 1940 an Experimental Tunnelling Section was formed and in 1941 Assault Engineer and Bomb Disposal Schools were formed. The schools ran a wide range of courses for all arms and the long courses were designed to be taken in sections so that students could attend the relevant parts.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} focusses {{primarily on}} {{questions concerning the}} development of banking services {{and the promotion of}} service provision expertise within the professional sphere of the banker. The starting point is the initially theoretical identification of expertise for the purpose of determining service provision expertise as the personnel-policy counterpart to the service society. Its incorporation into the curriculum, associated conflicts of interest in the policy organisation of vocational training and didactical co-ordination and gradation between the initial vocational training stage and further professional development are examined {{within the context of the}} complex of topics related to the implementation of expertise. The focal points of an intensive survey of trainers and <b>specialist</b> <b>instructors</b> in the banking sector with regard to the mediation of expertise and the learning of expertise are concentrated on the qualification profile and vocational profile of the banker, learning sector orientation, training venue co-operation and integration of new media into the initial vocational training as teaching, learning and co-operation medium. These are supplemented by a selection, review and analysis of training books for the occurrence, usage and contextualising of service provision expertise. In conclusion, the aspect of utilising expertise is discussed, i. e. the testing and marketability of service provision expertise in vocational training and professional development, and the current development trends for banking vocations are examined in connection with the development of models for services and careers...|$|R

40|$|There is convincing {{evidence}} {{about the benefits of}} exercise training in community dwelling frailer older people, but little evidence that this intervention can be delivered in general practice. In this prospective cohort study in 14 general practices in north London we assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of a tailored exercise referral programme for frail elderly patients delivered within a variety of inner city primary care settings. One hundred and twenty-six women and 32 men aged 75 years and older, deemed borderline frail by their GPs, took part in a two-phase progressive exercise programme (Stage 1 — primary care setting; Stage II — leisure/community centre setting) using the Timed Up And Go (TUG) test as the primary outcome measure. Baseline TUG measures confirmed that the participants were borderline frail and that GP selection was accurate. Of those referred by their GP or practice nurse 89 % took up the exercise programme; 73 % completed Stage I and 63 % made the transition to the community Stage II programme. TUG improved in Stage I with a mean difference of 3. 5 seconds (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Objectives To {{test whether}} older drug users (aged 40 and over) could be {{recruited}} to an exercise referral (ER) scheme, {{to evaluate the}} feasibility and acceptability and measure the impact of participation on health. Design Observational pilot. Setting Liverpool, UK. Participants (1) 12 men and 5 women recruited to ER. (2) 7 <b>specialist</b> gym <b>instructors.</b> Outcome measures Logistic feasibility and acceptability of ER and associated research, rate of recruitment, level of participation over 8  weeks and changes in health. Results 22 gym inductions were arranged (recruitment time: 5  weeks), 17 inductions were completed and 14 participants began exercising. Attendance at the gym fluctuated with people missing weeks then re-engaging; in week 8, seven participants were {{in contact with the}} project and five of these attended the gym. Illness and caring responsibilities affected participation. Participants and gym instructors found the intervention and associated research processes acceptable. In general, participants enjoyed exercising and felt fitter, but would have welcomed more support and the offer of a wider range of activities. Non-significant reductions in blood pressure and heart rate and improvements in metabolic equivalents (METs; a measure of fitness) and general well-being were observed for eight participants who completed baseline and follow-up assessments. The number of weeks of gym attendance was significantly associated with a positive change in METs. Conclusions It is feasible to recruit older drug users into a gym-based ER scheme, but multiple health and social challenges affect their ability to participate regularly. The observed changes in health measures, particularly the association between improvements in METs and attendance, suggest further investigation of ER for older drug users is worthwhile. Measures to improve the intervention and its evaluation include: better screening, refined inclusion/exclusion criteria, broader monitoring of physical activity levels, closer tailored support, more flexible exercise options and the use of incentive...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Based on {{the authors}} {{experience}} in applying different approaches of active learning and student-centered teaching, {{the main problem}} that prevented {{the achievement of the}} full advantages of these approaches is the lack of motivation of students for self-centered learning. A new model for a student-centered learning is presented in this work. This model is of teaching integrative thinking, based on existing models of creativity and synthesis. In this model, the student is put {{at the heart of a}} bigger learning process that includes <b>instructors,</b> <b>specialists</b> and the public. Usually students who are in the final year of their study will be the target of the application of this model as a part of a capstone course or final year project. This model promotes the research and thinking skills of the students as well as the gained motivation of self-learning as a result of being in contact with the specialists who might be their potential future employers. A proto-type web-based system based on this model was developed. Although it is applied on a sample of students from the Biology department, the system is readily expandable to any number of other disciplines without any complications or programming overheads. The results achieved from the application of this model were very encouraging...|$|R
