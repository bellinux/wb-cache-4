40|$|Panicle {{caterpillars}} comprise {{an economically}} important insect pest complex of sorghum throughout the Great Plains of the United States, particularly in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. The <b>sorghum</b> <b>panicle</b> caterpillar complex consists of larvae of two polyphagous lepidopteran species: the corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), and fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Sampling for panicle caterpillars in sorghum fields is usually accomplished by the beat bucket sampling technique with a fixed {{sample size of}} 30 beat bucket samples of one <b>sorghum</b> <b>panicle</b> each per 16. 2 ha of field. We used Wald's sequential probability ratio test for a negative binomial distribution to develop a sequential sampling plan for panicle caterpillars. In total, 115 sorghum fields were sampled in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas from June to August 2010. Panicle caterpillars had an aggregated distribution of counts confirmed by Pearson's chi-square statistic for lack of fit to the negative binomial distribution for each sampled field. A sequential sampling plan was developed using a high threshold (an economic threshold) of 0. 5 caterpillars per <b>sorghum</b> <b>panicle,</b> a low threshold (a safe level) of 0. 20 caterpillars per panicle, and fixed error rates (α = 0. 10 and β = 0. 05). At caterpillar densities > 0. 45 and < 0. 12 per panicle, {{the average number of}} panicles inspected to make a decision was less than the current recommendation of 30. In a 2013 validation test of 25 fields, the expected number of samples taken from average sample number curve was in close agreement with the number of samples required using the sequential plan (r 2 = 0. 93), and all fields were correctly classified when compared with a fixed sample size result. The plan improved upon current sampling recommendations for panicle caterpillars in sorghum because at known acceptable fixed error rates fewer samples were required when caterpillars are scarce or abundant, whereas more samples were required to make decisions with the same acceptable error rates when densities were near the economic thresholds...|$|E

Results showed that the most suitable method was a single inoculation of nontrimmed panicles when anthesis began in a panicle, followed by bagging. Comparison of resistance evaluation methods suggested that susceptible genotypes could be identified by a simple and rapid visual ergot rating on a 1 - 5 scale, where 1 = no ergot and 5 = more than 50 % spikelets in a panicle infected. However, resistance of genotypes should be confirmed by counting infected and healthy spikelets in a few primary branches of panicles. Screening of 213 Ethiopian sorghum accessions led to the identification of six ergot-resistant lines—ETS 1446, 2448, 2465, 3135, 4457, and 4927 —that are well adapted to the highlands of Ethiopia...|$|E

40|$|The candystripe {{variety of}} Sorghum bicolor {{displays}} a variegated pattern of red pigmented tissues in the pericarps, leaves, and stigmas. My dissertation encompasses different studies which are linked {{by a common}} theme [...] the investigation of transposable elements in sorghum. This work {{can be divided into}} three parts: a genetic characterization of the candystripe transposable element of sorghum, a molecular genetic study of two transposable elements cloned from sorghum, and a study of sorghum development utilizing the candystripe transposable element. In the first part of my study, I characterized the candystripe transposable element system and pigmentation genes involved in the candystripe phenotype. The variegated pattern appears to be caused by a transposable element inserted into the sorghum Y gene, producing an unstable allele, y-cs. I also found that the y-cs allele controls the pigmentation of the pericarps, leaves, and stigmas of candystripe sorghum plants. In the second part of my study, I molecularly isolated a putative transposable element from candystripe sorghum. This element is a homologue of the maize Activator transposable element family. This sorghum Activator homologue shares the consensus sequence for the 11 bp terminal inverted repeats of Activator elements, and also has 8 bp direct repeats. This homologue has a large deletion within the coding region of the transposase, and {{it appears to be a}} non-autonomous element similar to Ds. This region of Activator homology is adjacent to another region that appears to be an element with 150 nucleotide terminal inverted repeats, and appears to be similar to MITEs such as the Tourist element. The third part of my study was an investigation of sorghum vegetative and floral development utilizing the clonally-derived sectors of red tissue produced by the reversion of the y-cs allele. Through clonal analysis, I have determined that there is little compartmentalization of cell lineages in the sorghum apical meristem. The somatic tissues of the sorghum inflorescence and the vegetative structures share closely related cell lineages. However, the cell lineages of the gametophytic tissues of the inflorescence diverge from that of the somatic tissues of the pericarps early in the development of the panicle, and before the divergence of the pericarps and leaves. These data show that the development of the <b>sorghum</b> <b>panicle</b> is more similar to the development of the maize tassel than the maize ear. ...|$|E

Adjustment of planting date to synchronize flowering with the period of peak abundance of adults, planting infested rows of susceptible cultivars 20 days before the test cultivars, spreading damaged <b>sorghum</b> <b>panicles</b> containing diapausing larvae in infested rows and using sprinkler irrigation during flowering in the post-rainy season, helped to increase abundance. Careful and selective use of contact insecticides to control the mirid Calocoris angustatus and the eulophid Tetrastichus diplosidis [Aprostocetus diplosidis] were useful in screening and selecting sorghum cultivars for resistance. Planting 2 sets of test material at 14 day intervals reduced the chances that the sorghum would escape damage.

Use of a wire-framed cage covered with a blue bag resulted in the greatest damage in CSH 1. This technique was useful for verification of resistance under field conditions. The resistance of 21 cultivars to C. sorghicola was compared under no-choice cage and natural conditions for 4 seasons. Of 15 cultivars reported to be resistant under natural conditions, only 3 (DJ 6514, TAM 2566, and IS 12666 C) showed repeatable levels of resistance under no-choice conditions.

Panicles at half-anthesis with viable pollen and receptive stigmata suffered higher damage than those at the pre- and post-anthesis. Physical removal of anthers and stigmata significantly reduced the oviposition by the sorghum midge.

A promising alternative to chemical control of both CBW and PB is trap cropping, assisted with botanical pesticides sprays, if needed. We report studies conducted from 1995 – 98 on sorghum attractiveness to PB and CBW, on the potential of physic nut (Jatropha curcas) extracts [particularly the phorbol ester (PE) fraction of the oil] for sorghum protection fromPB damage, and on the insecticidal activity of Jatropha extracts on CBW. At the ICRISAT research station (Samanko, Mali), infestation by the five main species of PB (accounting for 96 % of total) was much higher on sorghum than on cotton. In the Kolokani region, CBW infestation was negligible on the Guinea loose-panicled sorghum cultivar Bibalawili, while it was significant on both compact-panicled PB susceptible ICSH 89002 and PB resistant Malisor 84 - 7.

40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Science (Plant Protection)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. During {{the past}} two decades, panicle-feeding Hemiptera have become pests of sorghum in West and Central Africa, and {{particularly}} in Mali, where this is a staple food crop. Of the more than 100 sorghum insect pests reported in Africa, 42 species {{were found to be}} panicle-feeding pests. Prior to this study, no research had been done on the paniclefeeding Hemiptera in South Africa. The objectives of the study were to determine the abundance and diversity of panicle-feeding Hemiptera on sorghum. A check list was compiled and the temporal distribution of different Hemiptera species determined during the different panicle stages of development. In addition, the effect of insecticide application on Hemiptera numbers was evaluated and the correlation between grain mould severity and Hemiptera feeding damage was investigated. To determine the abundance and diversity of Hemiptera on <b>sorghum</b> <b>panicles,</b> surveys were conducted between November 2004 and June 2006 at 26 sites in four provinces of South Africa. Two methods of collection were used viz. the plastic bag and D-Vac methods. The total number of the adults and nymphs collected during this study was 23 798. Forty-three different herbivorous Hemiptera species were collected. The most abundant family was the Miridae (41 %), followed by the Lygaeidae (17 %). Eurystylus spp., Calidea dregii, Campylomma sp., Creontiades pallidus, Nysius natalensis and Nezara viridula were the most abundant species and also occurred widely in the sorghum production area. Infestation levels of these species were low compared to that in other parts of Africa and it cannot be concluded that they have pest status in South Africa. There was no clear distinction between the stages during which panicles were infested by different species. The general tendency was that nearly all species were present from the flowering stage onwards and that numbers declined when grain hardened. In general, Campylomma sp. and C. pallidus numbers peaked during the flowering stage and Eurystylus spp. and N. natalensis during the milk stage. Hemiptera feeding damage resulted in an increase in incidence of seeds with discoloured germ, therefore contributing significantly to reduction in grain quality. Master...|$|R

In fiber sorghum plots ECB populations did not result noxious, while R. maidis density was higher than the one on grain sorghum, but infestations did not signifi-cantly affect the development of the stalks, being localized only on panicles during their first stage of develop-ment. The production of cyanogenetic compounds by young sorghum plants is likely to be an effective protection against ECB first generation larvae, while earlier harvest time of both grain and fiber sorghum compared with maize later harvest time prevents significant damages caused by ECB second generation larvae. Sorghum requires less water than maize. Such a condition, joint to the weak susceptibility to insect pests, could favour a further increase of sorghum cultivations in northern Italy...|$|R

The millet head miner, Heliocheilus albipunctella, reduces grain yield {{and quality of}} pearl millet. INTSORMIL entomologist Bonnie Pendleton, West Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M University, collaborates with African scientists to develop management strategies for sorghum and millet insects. Emphasis is on developing plants resistant to pests. Hundreds of sorghum and pearl millet genotypes have been evaluated by INTSORMIL scientists for grain yield and quality and resistance to insects {{in the field in}} Botswana, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, South Africa, and the United States. IER scientists Niamoye Yaro Diarisso and Mamourou Diourté found crosses of Malisor 84 - 7 and improved <b>sorghums</b> resistant to <b>panicle</b> bugs and grain mold in Mali. Four sorghums from the United States tested had high levels of resistance to panicle bugs, grain mold (photo right) and the sorghum midge (photo left) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} {{and distribution of}} the sorghum head bug, E. oldi (Heteroptera: Miridae), and other <b>panicle</b> pests of <b>sorghum</b> in research stations and farmers' fields in West and Central Africa (WCA) were assessed during 1985 - 94. Maximum head bug abundance was observed during the dough stage. Head bug abundance was greater on improved cultivars (CSM 388, Malisor 84 - 7, ICSV 1063, ICSV 247 and ICSH 507), while the local sorghum cultivar guineense with long glumes was less susceptible, both at the research stations and in farmers' fields. Grain damage was moderate to severe, although farmers were mostly unaware of this insect and its damage potential because it remains hidden inside the <b>panicle.</b> <b>Sorghum</b> midge (Stenodiplosis sorghicola) damage was very high in farmers' fields in Burkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria. The shootfly Atherigona soccata, stemborer Busseola fusca, grasshoppers, spittle bugs Locris rubens, Campylomma spp., Creontiades pallidus and Agonoscelis spp., head caterpillars Helicoverpa armigera, Pyroderces simplex and Eublemma gayneri, were other insect pests which damaged sorghum in the areas surveyed. It is proposed that future efforts in sorghum improvement for WCA should focus on developing cultivars with resistance to sorghum head bugs...|$|R
40|$|Grain {{yield and}} its primary determinants, grain number and weight, are {{important}} traits in cereal crops {{that have been}} well studied; however, the genetic basis of and interactions between these traits remain poorly understood. Characterization of grain yield per primary panicle (YPP), grain number per primary panicle (GNP), and 1000 -grain weight (TGW) in sorghum [(L.) Moench], a hardy C cereal with a genome size of ∼ 730 Mb, was implemented in a diversity panel containing 390 accessions. These accessions were genotyped to obtain 268, 830 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed to identify loci associated with each grain yield component and understand the genetic interactions between these traits. Genome-wide association studies identified associations across the genome with YPP, GNP, and TGW that were located within previously mapped <b>sorghum</b> QTL for <b>panicle</b> weight, grain yield, and seed size, respectively. There were no significant associations between GNP and TGW that were within 100 kb, {{much greater than the}} average linkage disequilibrium (LD) in sorghum. The identification of nonoverlapping loci for grain number and weight suggests these traits may be manipulated independently to increase the grain yield of sorghum. Following GWAS, genomic regions surrounding each associated SNP were mined for candidate genes. Previously published expression data indicated several TGW candidate genes, including an ethylene receptor homolog, were primarily expressed within developing seed tissues to support GWAS. Furthermore, maize (L.) homologs of identified TGW candidates were differentially expressed within the seed between small- and large-kernel lines from a segregating maize population...|$|R
