40|$|The {{problem of}} control of a wind power {{generator}} in cases when voltage sags occur in the electric power system {{is presented in the}} paper. Double <b>fed</b> <b>machine</b> (DFM) used as the generator in the wind power plant is considered. The stator of the DFM is connected to the grid and the cascade of power electronic inverters supplies the rotor. When the voltage drop or sag occurs in the power network, controllers of the cascade of power electronic inverters can work incorrectly. In this case, the wind power generators are disconnected in present solutions. Results of simulation of the system with models of the double <b>fed</b> <b>machine,</b> the grid transformer and the inverters are presented in the paper. To control the generated power the structure based on a multiscalar model of the DFM was used. Proposed solution of control makes it possible to keep the power plant in the power system during required time.

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{has been}} established for obtaining equivalent circuit parameters for the brushless doubly <b>fed</b> <b>machine,</b> {{also known as the}} brushless doubly <b>fed</b> induction <b>machine,</b> by transforming a reduced coupled-circuit model into a sequence component form. This approach takes advantage of the model reduction procedure's ability to reduce a complex rotor structure to a single equivalent loop without significant loss of accuracy. An alternative method based on winding factors has also been developed and includes coupling via harmonic fields.

40|$|Compared to the doubly <b>fed</b> <b>machine,</b> the {{brushless}} doubly <b>fed</b> <b>machine</b> (BDFM) {{has high}} reliability and low maintenance requirements. First, {{by taking the}} negative conjugation of the control motor variables in rotor reference frame, a state-space model of BDFM is derived. It is then transformed into synchronous reference frame, called synchronous reference frame state-space model (SSSM). In this way, all the variables of the SSSM are DC under the static state. Second, {{on the basis of}} the analysis of static equations, the possible output torque limits are obtained. Third, the causes of losing control are analyzed by the flux and the torque derivatives. A new control strategy called synthetic vector direct torque control (SVDTC) is proposed to solve the losing control problems of the conventional direct torque control (DTC). Finally, the correctness of the results of this paper is verified by calculation examples and simulation results, the losing control problems can be solved, and the theoretical output capacity limits can be reached using SVDTC...|$|R

40|$|The {{brushless}} doubly <b>fed</b> reluctance <b>machine</b> (BDFRM) {{is related}} to the better known brushless doubly <b>fed</b> induction <b>machine</b> (BDFIM). Research into doubly <b>fed</b> <b>machines</b> is motivated {{by the fact that they}} allow the use of a partially rated inverter in many variable-speed applications. Research into the BDFRM has been largely ignored in comparison to the BDFIM, despite the fact that it has the potential for greater efficiency as compared to the BDFIM, and the rotor is simpler to manufacture. This paper compares the BDFRM and its singly fed cousin, the synchronous reluctance machine. This is a natural comparison since both machines use the same reluctance rotor. The first part of the paper establishes relationships between the inductances of the two machines. This is then used to facilitate a comparison using the constraints that both machines have the same amount of active material, i. e., the same amount of copper and iron, and that the copper losses for both machines are the same. This analysis also allows an approximate comparison with the conventional squirrel-cage induction machine. The analysis is carried out using machine-independent normalization...|$|R

Transmission interconnection benefits from load diversity, {{variety of sources}} and fuel prices. In addition; nation-level grid interconnection offers increased reliability, reduction of power interruption and generation-cost minimization. Various techniques are applicable for grid interconnection like High Voltage Direct Current links (HVDC), Variable Frequency Transformer (VFT) and Doubly Fed Induction Machine (DFIM).
