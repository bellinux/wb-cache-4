5|$|An article {{published}} by Politico in September 2017, cited a <b>self-assessment</b> by the 173rd Airborne Brigade as {{stating that the}} brigade lacked “essential capabilities needed to accomplish its mission effectively and with decisive speed”. The document detailed a number of “capability gaps”, which had been identified during the brigade′s training with Ukrainian troops that had experience fighting against Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine. The report described deficiencies in air defense and electronic warfare units {{as well as an}} over-reliance on satellite communications and GPS navigation systems. These are said to make the unit vulnerable to an enemy with high-end equipment and technology.|$|E

Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) combines an unflattering appraisal of himself from an early newspaper {{of the program and}} his blunt <b>self-assessment</b> that he is unlikely to remain employed at Dunder Mifflin for very long after it airs, and decides it is time to pursue his dreams of stardom. After many fruitless calls to dismissive talent agencies, he finds himself at the dual talent agency/real estate office run by Carla Fern (Roseanne Barr). Carla agrees to represent Andy, who is thrilled that he only has to pay $5,000 for the privilege.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we employ the tool of {{anchoring}} vignettes to analyze gender differences in <b>self-assessments</b> of health in Europe. We propose and estimate {{an extension of the}} basic vignette model for correcting the lack of interpersonal comparability of <b>self-assessments</b> on a categorical scale. Our extension allows for potential correlation in the <b>self-assessments</b> of health on different domains by including an unobservable individual effect, common to all domains but different across individuals, in both the thresholds and the equations for the latent health problems. After applying this model to the SHARE data, we find that vignettes help narrow gender differences in <b>self-assessments</b> of health, although these differences are not entirely eliminated...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between age, spatial abilities, spatial <b>self-assessments,</b> working memory (WM) and environment knowledge, through an orientation task based on pointing in cardinal directions, across the adult lifespan using the structural equationmodeling (SEM) approach. A group of 450 people from 20 to 91 years oldwas asked to point in the direction of cardinal points and to complete a set of spatial tasks, spatial questionnaires andWMmeasures. Results showed that, while spatial abilities and positive <b>self-assessments</b> mediated the influence of age on the ability to identify cardinal points,WMaccounted for the age-related variance in spatial abilities and positive <b>self-assessments.</b> Age also had a direct influence on both positive and negative selfassessments.

40|$|This study {{examined}} 48 computer-based compositions produced by adolescents (13 – 14 years old) using evaluations by specialist music {{teachers and the}} adolescents’ self-evaluations and <b>self-assessments.</b> Based on previous research (Seddon and O’Neill, 2001), we expected that the teachers’ evaluations of the compositions would not differentiate between the compositions by adolescents with or without 2 – 4 years prior experience of formal instrumental music tuition (FIMT). We also predicted that the self-evaluations and selfassessments of adolescents with FIMT would be higher than the self-evaluations and <b>self-assessments</b> by adolescents without FIMT. The results supported our predictions suggesting that adolescents’ self-evaluations {{of their ability to}} compose and their <b>self-assessments</b> of their own compositions are determined by their levels of self-perceived competence, and that this is influenced by whether or not they have previous experience of FIMT.

25|$|Cultural {{competence}} {{is defined as}} a set of congruent behaviors, attitudes, and policies that come together in a system, agency, or among professionals and that enables them to work effectively in cross-cultural situations. Essential elements that enable organizations to become culturally competent include valuing diversity, having the capacity for cultural <b>self-assessment,</b> being conscious of the dynamics inherent when cultures interact, having institutionalized cultural knowledge, and having developed adaptations to service delivery reflecting an understanding of cultural diversity. By definition, diversity includes differences in race, ethnicity, age, gender, size, religion, sexual orientation, and physical and mental ability. Accordingly, organizations should include these considerations in all aspects of policy making, administration, practice, and service delivery.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{report the}} results of several {{randomized}} survey experiments designed to evaluate two intended improvements to anchoring vignettes, an increasingly common technique used to improve interpersonal comparability in survey research. This technique asks for respondent <b>self-assessments</b> followed by assessments of hypothetical people described in vignettes. Variation in assessments of the vignettes across respondents reveals interpersonal incomparability, allowing researchers to improve comparability by rescaling <b>self-assessments</b> relative to vignette responses. Our experiments show, first, that switching the question order so that <b>self-assessments</b> follow the vignettes primes respondents to define the response scale in a common way. In this case, priming is not a bias to avoid but a means of better communicating the question’s meaning. Second, we demonstrate that combining vignettes and <b>self-assessments</b> in a single direct comparison induces inconsistent and considerably less informative responses. Since similar combined strategies are widely employed for related purposes, our results suggest that anchoring vignettes could reduce measurement error in many applications where they are not currently used.

2500|$|In general, optimal PA process {{involves}} {{a combination of}} multiple assessment modalities. [...] One common recommendation is that assessment flows from <b>self-assessment,</b> to peer-assessment, to management assessment - in that order. [...] Starting with <b>self-assessment</b> facilitates avoidance of conflict. [...] Peer feedback ensures peer accountability, which may yield better results than accountability to management. [...] Management assessment comes last for need of recognition by authority and avoidance of conflict in case of disagreements.

40|$|With the {{increased}} focus on applying procedural justice into policing practice, {{a small number}} of studies have examined officer attitudes to procedural justice. These studies have measured a diverse range of attitudinal concepts – from officers’ alignment to procedural justice principles, to the perceived effectiveness of the principles in obtaining compliance from the public. A concept of particular interest is officers’ sense of themselves as acting in a procedurally just manner. As police work is characterised by a high degree of discretion in how officers interact with the public, measuring how such procedural justice <b>self-assessments</b> change over time might indicate hindrances to the longer term uptake of procedural justice. Additionally, understanding what factors influence positive procedural justice <b>self-assessments</b> will assist police organisations in developing officers who identify as procedurally just. This study explores how officers’ procedural justice <b>self-assessments</b> change through recruit training and after officers have become operational. Using longitudinal survey data from Queensland Police recruits collected at the beginning of recruit training (n[*]=[*] 501), at the end of training six months later (n[*]=[*] 331), and after one year of operational experience (n[*]=[*] 152), this study finds that recruits’ procedural justice <b>self-assessments</b> decrease substantially by the end of training, but change little after officers become operational. Further, positive procedural justice <b>self-assessments</b> are predicted predominantly by self-assessed interpersonal skills more so than other attitudinal or demographic measures. The findings suggest that if police organisations wish to develop procedurally just officers, efforts should be concentrated toward improving recruits’ interpersonal skills when dealing with the public.
