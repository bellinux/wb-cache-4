5|$|Continual {{growth and}} outside {{investments}} {{during these years}} allowed the company to expand and grow: Odwalla's revenue tripled from 1994 to 1995, and in 1996 they made more than $59million in sales, their highest ever. This constant growth made Odwalla {{one of the largest}} fresh-juice companies in America by 1996, when the company was selling its products to stores in seven states and parts of Canada. It was estimated that they would reach $100million in <b>sales</b> <b>by</b> 1999. Much of this growth resulted from the perception that Odwalla's products were healthier than regular juice because of unpasteurization.|$|E

5|$|Development of the {{sandwich}} began in 2001 {{in response to}} several major factors. After an overall sales decline of 17% coupled with a profit decline of 29%, Burger King {{held a series of}} consumer tests that showed the company's customer base was looking for a wider variety of options when making purchases. Additional survey results revealed that a lack of newer products was discouraging consumers from visiting the chain. Furthermore, the company was seeking to counter the threat to its <b>sales</b> <b>by</b> newer fast casual restaurants that had begun to bite into <b>sales.</b> <b>By</b> July 2002, the chain had sold nearly fifty million of {{the sandwich}}es, eventually displacing the BK Broiler's initial launch figures as the company's best selling product introduction. The successful introduction of the Chicken Whopper {{was one of the few}} noted positive highlights of the company during negotiations for the sale of Burger King by its then owner Diageo to a group of investors led by the TPG Capital; Chicago-based consulting firm Technomic Inc. President Ron Paul was quoted that he was encouraged by recent product changes at Burger King such as the new Chicken Whopper, but he said it was too early to tell whether the changes have been successful. Despite the Chicken Whopper's initial success, just over a year after the its introduction, enthusiasm for the product was waning; Burger King's largest franchisee, Carrols Corporation, was complaining that the product line was a failure, describing the sandwich as a pedestrian product with a great name.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, after {{temporarily}} {{losing its}} Fox affiliation for WFFT-TV to a subchannel of WISE-TV {{due to a}} reverse compensation dispute, Nexstar (ironically, given its use of similar practices in other markets) filed an antitrust lawsuit against the station's managing partner, Granite Broadcasting, arguing that it had built a monopoly on local advertising <b>sales</b> <b>by</b> having effective control of the outlets for five major networks (ABC and MyNetworkTV on WPTA, and NBC, Fox, and The CW on WISE-TV; owned by Malara Broadcast Group and operated under agreements by Granite). The lawsuit was settled in February 2013 via mutual agreement, after which the Fox affiliation was given back to WFFT.|$|E
5|$|RTI {{scientists}} Monroe Wall and Mansukh Wani synthesized anti-cancer treatments camptothecin in 1966, {{from the}} bark of the Camptotheca tree, and Taxol in 1971, from a Pacific yew tree.

In 1986, RTI was awarded a $4 million contract with the National Cancer Institute to conduct an eight-year clinical trial on the effects of an anti-smoking campaign. Two years later, RTI began a $4.4 million program to coordinate AIDS drug trials for the National Institutes of Health. This had grown to $26 million by 1988.|$|E

5|$|The Gaon Album Chart is a South Korean {{record chart}} that ranks the best-selling albums and EPs in South Korea. It {{is part of}} the Gaon Music Chart, which {{launched}} in February 2010.

5|$|The album debuted {{at number}} 3 on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 131,000 copies in the United States.

The album currently {{remains on the}} top half of the Billboard 200 and Top R/Hip-Hop Albums charts. On February 16, 2010, the album was certified gold in <b>sales,</b> <b>by</b> the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), following shipments in excess of 500,000 copies in the United States. It is Songz's first RIAA-certified album. As of June 11, 2014, Ready was officially certified platinum by the RIAA.|$|E
5|$|The album {{experienced}} {{a significant amount}} of commercial success and sales for a hip hop record at the time, earning U.S. Billboard chart success and selling over 500,000 copies within its first five months of release.

Initial criticism of the album was generally positive, as LL Cool J's lyricism and Rick Rubin's production were praised by several music critics.

5|$|Under federal law, private-party sellers are not {{required}} to perform background checks on buyers, whether at a gun show or other venue. They also are {{not required}} to record the sale, or ask for identification. This requirement is in contrast to <b>sales</b> <b>by</b> gun stores and other Federal Firearms License (FFL) holders who are required to record all sales and perform background checks on almost all buyers, regardless of whether the venue is their business location or a gun show. Access to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) is limited to FFL holders and FFLs are not issued to persons that only sell firearms at gun shows.|$|E
5|$|Upon its publication, {{the book}} {{received}} favorable comments from book reviewers. Thompson later {{claimed that the}} Navy tried to suppress <b>sales</b> <b>by</b> banning the book from Navy exchange stores on Navy bases throughout the world. In 2001, five Navy servicemen named in Thompson's book sued Thompson, the book's publisher, and one of Thompson's sources for libel, false light privacy, and conspiracy. The suit was settled out-of-court in 2007 for undisclosed terms.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{customer}} {{demand for}} the product, another major reason for the reintroduction was due to a significant rise {{in the cost of}} beef. During the previous few {{months leading up to the}} reintroduction of Chicken Fries, the available cattle stocks had declined since the USDA began record keeping in 1973. This shortage of ground beef caused a spike in the price of beef to all-time highs in June 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, increasing competition from McDonald's, Wendy's and other chains in the fast food industry drove Burger King to boost <b>sales</b> <b>by</b> introducing new products along similar lines. Two major competitors had been revamping their menus with products such as variations on the McDouble from McDonald's and sandwiches based on pretzel-style buns from Wendy's.|$|E
