5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the vast {{majority}} of medical residents in the United States were physicians who had recently graduated from a medical school in the United States. While graduating from a medical school provides an individual with a medical degree, a state medical license is required to practice medicine. All states require that an individual pass <b>Step</b> <b>3</b> of the USMLE or COMLEX exams and complete at least one year of residency training to obtain an unrestricted medical license; in practice, most practicing physicians complete their multiyear residency. While training, residents practice medicine with considerable autonomy under the supervision of attending physicians.|$|E
5|$|The True Directions program {{involves}} the campers admitting their homosexuality (step 1), rediscovering their gender identity by performing stereotypically gender-associated tasks (step 2), finding {{the root of}} their homosexuality through family therapy (<b>step</b> <b>3),</b> demystifying the other sex (step 4), and simulating heterosexual intercourse (step 5). Over {{the course of the}} program, Megan becomes friends with another girl at the camp, a college student named Graham (Clea DuVall) who, though more comfortable being gay than Megan, was forced to the camp at the risk of otherwise being disowned by her family.|$|E

25|$|Note that steps 1. and 2. {{result is}} an empty graph if H is planar, but the bounded number of {{vertices}} added in <b>step</b> <b>3.</b> makes the statement consistent with Corollary 1.|$|E
25|$|In <b>Step</b> <b>3,</b> {{the sphere}} was {{partitioned}} into orbits {{of our group}} H. To streamline the proof, the discussion of points that are fixed by some rotation was omitted; since the paradoxical decomposition of F2 relies on shifting certain subsets, {{the fact that some}} points are fixed might cause some trouble. Since any rotation of S2 (other than the null rotation) has exactly two fixed points, and since H, which is isomorphic to F2, is countable, there are countably many points of S2 that are fixed by some rotation in H, denote this set of fixed points D. <b>Step</b> <b>3</b> proves that S2 − D admits a paradoxical decomposition.|$|E

25|$|The fourth box is <b>Step</b> <b>3,</b> {{which is}} the {{saturation}} of the alpha-beta unsaturated double bond between carbons 2 and 3. In this step of the reaction, Lysine deprotonates the oxygen off the alpha carbon and the {{lone pair of electrons}} on the oxygen of the alpha carbon comes down reforming the ketone double bond and pushing the lone pair (forming the double bond between the alpha and beta carbon) off, picking up a proton from the nearby Tyrosine amino acid. This reaction results in the formation of alpha-ketoglutarate, NADH + H+/NADPH + H+, and CO2.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} S4, S5, and the graph are empty. We pop {{vertices}} off Sd. If the vertex were merged with another vertex in <b>step</b> <b>3,</b> the vertex {{that it was}} merged with will already have been colored, and we assign it the same color. This is valid because we only merged vertices that were not adjacent in the original graph. If we had removed it in step 2 because it had at most 4 adjacent vertices, all of its neighbors {{at the time of}} its removal will have already been colored, and we can simply assign it a color that none of its neighbors is using.|$|E
25|$|Dimethyltryptamine is an indole {{alkaloid}} {{derived from}} the shikimate pathway. Its biosynthesis is relatively simple and summarized in the adjacent picture. In plants, the parent amino acid L-tryptophan is produced endogenously where in animals L-tryptophan is an essential amino acid coming from diet. No matter the source of L-tryptophan, the biosynthesis begins with its decarboxylation by an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme (step 1). The resulting decarboxylated tryptophan analog is tryptamine. Tryptamine then undergoes a transmethylation (step 2): the enzyme indolethylamine-N-methyltransferase (INMT) catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from cofactor S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), via nucleophilic attack, to tryptamine. This reaction transforms SAM into S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and gives the intermediate product N-methyltryptamine (NMT). NMT is in turn transmethylated by the same process (<b>step</b> <b>3)</b> to form the end product N,N-dimethyltryptamine. Tryptamine transmethylation is regulated by two products of the reaction: SAH, and DMT were shown ex vivo {{to be among the}} most potent inhibitors of rabbit INMT activity.|$|E

30|$|As the <b>Steps</b> <b>3</b> and 4 are {{redundant}} for signal detection, we {{name the}} FrFT without the <b>Steps</b> <b>3</b> and 4 as simplified FrFT (SFrFT). Note this SFrFT is different the simplified FrFT proposed in [21]. The SFrFT {{is also a}} linear transform and continuous in the angle α. This provides us {{a powerful tool for}} detecting SAR moving targets, particularly when there are multiple moving targets.|$|R
