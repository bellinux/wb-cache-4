5|$|In {{autoimmunity}} {{the immune}} system wrongly recognizes certain native molecules in the body as foreign (self-antigen), and mounts an immune response against them. Since these native molecules, as normal parts of the body, will naturally always exist in the body, the attacks against them can get stronger over time (akin to <b>secondary</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response).</b> Moreover, many organisms exhibit molecular mimicry, which involves showing those antigens on their surface that are antigenically similar to the host proteins. This has two possible consequences: first, either the organism will be spared as a self antigen; or secondly, that the antibodies produced against it will also bind to the mimicked native proteins. The antibodies will attack the self-antigens and the tissues harboring them by activating various mechanisms like the complement activation and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Hence, wider the range of antibody-specificities, greater the chance that {{one or the other}} will react against self-antigens (native molecules of the body).|$|E
500|$|A naive (or inexperienced) B cell is {{one which}} {{belongs to a}} clone which has never {{encountered}} the epitope {{to which it is}} specific. In contrast, a memory B cell is one which derives from an activated naive or memory [...] B cell. The activation of a naive or a memory B cell is followed by a manifold proliferation of that particular B cell, most of the progeny of which terminally differentiate into plasma B cells; the rest survive as memory B cells. So, when the naive cells belonging to a particular clone encounter their specific antigen to give rise to the plasma cells, and also leave a few memory cells, this is known as the primary immune response. In the course of proliferation of this clone, the B cell receptor genes can undergo [...] frequent (one in every two cell divisions) mutations in the genes coding for paratopes of antibodies. These frequent mutations are termed somatic hypermutation. Each such mutation alters the epitope-binding ability of the paratope slightly, creating new clones of B cells in the process. Some of the newly created paratopes bind more strongly to the same epitope (leading to the selection of the clones possessing them), which is known as affinity maturation. Other paratopes bind better to epitopes that are slightly different from the original epitope that had stimulated proliferation. Variations in the epitope structure are also usually produced by mutations in the genes of pathogen coding for their antigen. Somatic hypermutation, thus, makes the B cell receptors and the soluble antibodies in subsequent encounters with antigens, more inclusive in their antigen recognition potential of altered epitopes, apart from bestowing greater specificity for the antigen that induced proliferation in the first place. When the memory cells get stimulated by the antigen to produce plasma cells (just like in the clone's primary response), and leave even more memory cells in the process, this is known as a <b>secondary</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response,</b> which translates into greater numbers of plasma cells and faster rate of antibody production lasting for longer periods. The memory B cells produced as a part of secondary response recognize the corresponding antigen faster and bind more strongly with it (i.e., greater affinity of binding) owing to affinity maturation. The soluble antibodies produced by the clone show a similar enhancement in antigen binding.|$|E

50|$|Basophils {{appear in}} many {{specific}} kinds of inflammatory reactions, {{particularly those that}} cause allergic symptoms.

They are found in tissues where allergic reactions are occurring and probably contribute to the severity of these reactions. Basophils have protein receptors on their cell surface that bind IgE, an immunoglobulin involved in macroparasite defense and allergy. It is the bound IgE antibody that confers a selective response of these cells to environmental substances, for example, pollen proteins or helminth antigens.

5000|$|Immune {{response}} is the immunological response originating from immune system activation by antigens, including immunity to pathogenic microorganisms and its products, {{as well as}} autoimmunity to self-antigens allergies, and graft ejections. In this process main cells involved are the T cells, B cells of lymphocytes, and macrophagea. These cells produce lymphokines that influence the other host cells activities. B cells mature to produce immunoglobulins or antibodies, that react with antigens. At the same time, macrophages are processing the antigens into immunogenic units which stimulate B lymphocites to differentiation into antibody secreting plasma cells, stimulating the T cells to realise lymphokines. Complement {{is a group of}} normal serum proteins to aim immunity by becoming activated form as result of antigen-antibody interaction. The first contact with any antigen sensitize individual affected and promote the primary immune response. Next of the sensitized individuals with same antigen result in a more rapid and massive reaction, called the <b>secondary</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> ("booster response" [...] or the [...] "anamnestic reaction").

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Severe combined immune deficient mice (SCID) were xenografted subcutaneously with human adult tonsil pieces (hu-ton-SCID mice). Such animals were: (a) compared with those receiving tonsil cells in suspension, and (b) immunized with de novo and recall antigens. RESULTS: Human tonsil pieces survived {{a long period of}} time in SCID mice, while polyclonal human T- and B-lymphocytes persisted in close vicinity within the implantation area; however, little or no graft-versus-host disease was detectable. Not surprisingly, local development of lymphoproliferative disease was often observed in animals receiving lymphoid implants from donors previously infected by the Epstein-Barr virus. One month after surgery, higher serum levels of human IgG were found in SCID mice transplanted with tonsil pieces (2 x 10 (7) cells/animal) than in animals injected with 5 x 10 (7) tonsil cells in suspension (1. 9 vs. 0. 3 mg/mL, p 700 -fold increase in anti-TT IgG levels) and long-lasting (> 6 months) <b>secondary</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses.</b> CONCLUSION: The hu-ton-SCID mouse xenochimeric model described in this report may improve our understanding of human lymphoid cell interactions, <b>secondary</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses,</b> and lymphomagenesis...|$|R

These questions were addressed in a well-established murine model of eosinophilic airway inflammation Balb/c mice were sensitized to OVA by an intratracheal injection of OVA-pulsed bone marrow-derived DCs.

For <b>secondary</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> mice were boosted intra-intestinally, intravenously or subcutaneously. The distribution of antigen specific cells in situ was demonstrated by enzyme histochemistry whereas quantification of TNP-specific cells was performed with a plaque-forming cell assay. After single or repeated intra-intestinal antigen administrations both primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> in terms of specific antibody containing cells were mainly located in the spleen. The anti-TNP antibody-containing cells produced predominantly IgM during the primary and IgM, IgG and IgA during the secondary response. In mesenteric lymph nodes and villi antigen-specific cells were detected sporadically. When intra-intestinal priming was followed by intravenous or subcutaneous booster injections most anti-TNP antibody-producing cells were demonstrated in the spleen and in the draining popliteal lymph nodes. In contrast to repeated intravenous or subcutaneous immunizations alone, these organs contained, besides specific IgM and IgG cells, many TNP-specific cells producing IgA antibodies. This result demonstrates that the production of IgA antibodies is not restricted to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues. IgA memory cells are induced in mucosa associated lymphoid tissues, probably in Peyer's patches, will consecutively migrate throughout the whole lymphoid system and can be triggered by renewed antigen contact to become IgA plasma cells...|$|R
