5|$|Troilus, however, {{after he}} had learned of his father's {{intention}} {{to go ahead and}} release Briseida and restore her to the Greeks, was overwhelmed and completely wracked by great grief, and almost entirely consumed by tears, anguished <b>sighs,</b> <b>and</b> laments, because he cherished her with the great fervour of youthful love and had been led by the excessive ardour of love into the intense longing of blazing passion. There was no one of his dear ones who could console him.|$|E
25|$|Thomas DeQuincey {{developed}} a female trinity, Our Lady of Tears, the Lady of <b>Sighs</b> <b>and</b> Our Lady of Darkness, in Suspiria De Profundis, {{which has been}} likened to Graves's Triple Goddess but stamped with DeQuincey's own melancholy sensibility.|$|E

25|$|Generally speaking, Paganini's {{compositions}} were technically imaginative, and the timbre of {{the instrument}} was greatly expanded {{as a result of}} these works. Sounds of different musical instruments and animals were often imitated. One such composition was titled Il Fandango Spanolo (The Spanish Dance), which featured a series of humorous imitations of farm animals. Even more outrageous was a solo piece Duetto Amoroso, in which the <b>sighs</b> <b>and</b> groans of lovers were intimately depicted on the violin. There survives a manuscript of the Duetto, which has been recorded. The existence of the Fandango is known only through concert posters.|$|E
25|$|In 1877, Henry Boyd succeeded Michell, {{becoming}} the second {{principal of the}} refounded Hertford College. His energy, good connections and longevity created the modern College as it is today. Boyd's name appears carved on the landmark Bridge of <b>Sighs,</b> <b>and</b> he is commemorated by a memorial in the Chapel (to {{the left of the}} chancel) and a portrait in the Hall (at the west end of High Table). Boyd's partnership with the architect Thomas Graham Jackson brought about the expansion of the College and its endowment with its iconic 'Anglo-Jackson' buildings. In 1887, Jackson began work on the Gatehouse, the Hall and its spiral staircase, and the north range of the Old Quad. In 1901, Jackson started building the College's site on the northern side of New College Lane. By 1908, he had completed a new Chapel, which he declared to be his favourite work. Eventually, after much opposition, he built the Bridge of Sighs, linking the Old and New Quads across New College Lane, in 1913.|$|E
500|$|All baleen whales use {{sound for}} {{communication}} and {{are known to}} [...] "sing", especially during the breeding season. Blue whales produce the loudest sustained sounds of any animals: their low-frequency (about 20Hz) moans can last for half a minute, reach almost 190 decibels, and be heard hundreds of kilometers away. Adult male humpbacks produce the longest and most complex songs; sequences of moans, groans, roars, <b>sighs,</b> <b>and</b> chirps sometimes lasting more than ten minutes are repeated for hours. Typically, all humpback males in a population sing the same song over a breeding season, but the songs change slightly between seasons, and males in one population have been observed adapting the song from males of a neighboring population over a few breeding seasons.|$|E

500|$|Carey's {{cover of}} [...] "Bringin' On the Heartbreak", was {{recorded}} using live instrumentation, {{and was the}} album's third single. It begins as a [...] "piano-driven slow jam", which {{is followed by a}} [...] "dramatic chord progression" [...] after the second chorus, and Carey's [...] "precise and fluttery voice reaches incredible heights" [...] as it [...] "turns the power ballad into something more delicate." [...] Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times called [...] "Yours""a delectable combination of breathy vocals and playful rhythms." [...] Barry Walters from Rolling Stone wrote that on [...] "Yours", [...] "Carey's lead vocals blend into choruses of overdubbed Mariah's cooing overlapping phrases. Circling these are choirs of more Mariahs singing harmonies and countermelodies. Topping it off are generous sprinklings of the singer's patented birdcalls, wails, <b>sighs</b> <b>and</b> whispers." ...|$|E
500|$|The fourth {{song and}} third single [...] "Break the Ice" [...] opens with Spears singing the lines [...] "It's {{been a while}} / I know I shouldn't have kept you waiting / But I'm here now". The song {{features}} a choir and Keri Hilson singing background vocals sounding almost like a duet. Hilson explained the song is about [...] "two people, a girl and a guy, [...] and the girl is saying, 'You're a little cold. Let me warm things up and [...]'" [...] After the chorus, the bridge begins with Spears saying [...] "I like this part" [...] mimicking Janet Jackson in [...] "Nasty" [...] (1986). The album's fifth track, [...] "Heaven on Earth", is a Euro disco love song with new wave influences. It is inspired by Donna Summer's [...] "I Feel Love" [...] (1977), with three vocal lines taking place over the beat. Nicole Morier commented that the song was written from a very dark place, saying, [...] "I was thinking of someone and thinking they were so perfect and that I have all these imperfections. [...] I think what's touching {{about it is that}} it's from the perspective of someone who feels like they really need this person just to feel safe and feel good." [...] Spears named the song her favorite from Blackout. The sixth track, [...] "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)" [...] is an uptempo R song about sex. It is a duet between Spears and Danja, who sings the chorus with his voice distorted to sound like a decaying moan. Spears contributes a series of gasps, <b>sighs</b> <b>and</b> chants and her voice is also distorted.|$|E

60|$|On this occasion, the disconsolate lover {{could be}} wretched to his heart's content; for Catherine had {{not a word}} or a look for him, but {{bestowed}} all her smiles upon the handsome stranger who owned the black horse. As for poor Tummas Bullock, his passion was never violent; and he was content in the present instance to <b>sigh</b> <b>and</b> drink beer. He <b>sighed</b> <b>and</b> drank, <b>sighed</b> <b>and</b> drank, and drank again, until he had swallowed {{so much of the}} Corporal's liquor, as to be induced to accept a guinea from his purse also; and found himself, on returning to reason and sobriety, a soldier of Queen Anne's.|$|R
2500|$|When {{the version}} with Bardot was recorded, the French press {{reported}} {{that it was an}} [...] "audio vérité".

The first time Gainsbourg played it in public was in a Paris restaurant immediately after they recorded it. Birkin said that [...] "as it began to play all you could hear were the knives and forks being put down. 'I think we have a hit record', he said." ...|$|E
2500|$|The musical {{structure}} of the Ashkenazi Kol Nidrei is built upon a simple groundwork, the melody being an intermingling of simple cantillation with rich figuration. The opening of Kol Nidre is what the masters of the Catholic plain-song term a [...] "pneuma", or soul breath. Instead of announcing the opening words in a monotone or {{in any of the}} familiar declamatory phrases, a hazzan of South Germany prefixed a long, sighing tone, falling to a lower note and rising again, as if only <b>sighs</b> <b>and</b> sobs could find utterance before the officiant could bring himself to inaugurate the Day of Atonement.|$|E
2500|$|Rowling made a guest {{appearance}} as {{herself on the}} American animated sitcom The Simpsons, in a special British-themed episode entitled [...] "The Regina Monologues". The dialogue consisted of a short conversation between Rowling and Lisa Simpson, who mispronounces Rowling's name. She acknowlewdges Lisa with [...] "Thank you, young Muggle". When Lisa asks her about the ending of Harry Potter, Rowling <b>sighs</b> <b>and</b> says: [...] "He grows up, and marries you. Is {{that what you want}} to hear?" [...] to which Lisa swoons and dreamily replies, [...] "Yes!" [...] before Rowling rolls her eyes and walks away.|$|E

2500|$|The show draws to a {{close with}} the {{chairman}} imparting some final words of wisdom intended to evoke time, destiny, fate and eternity, undercut with silliness. For example: [...] "...And so, as the hunter of time blasts the moose of eternity, and the dairy counter worker of fate <b>sighs</b> <b>and</b> grabs her mop..." [...] Lyttelton's final sign-off on the show, shortly before his death in April 2008, was: [...] "And so as the loose-bowelled pigeon of time swoops low over the unsuspecting tourist of destiny, and the flatulent skunk of fate wanders into the air-conditioning system of eternity, I notice it's the end of the show." ...|$|E
2500|$|After he {{has been}} greeted by friends, Lina and Stiffelio are left alone (Non ha per me un accento – [...] "She has no word for me, not a glance"). He tells her of the sin he has {{witnessed}} (Vidi dovunque gemere – [...] "Everywhere I saw virtue groan beneath the oppressor's yoke") and then notices that her wedding ring is not on her finger. Angrily, he demands to know why (Ah v'appare in fronte scritto – [...] "Ah, clearly written on your brow is the shame that wages war in your heart"), but Stankar arrives to escort him to the celebrations being arranged by his friends. Alone, Lina is filled with remorse (A te ascenda, O Dio clemente - [...] "Let my <b>sighs</b> <b>and</b> tears ascend to thee, O merciful God").|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, Suspiria {{had been}} an {{unexpectedly}} big box office hit for 20th Century Fox, released in the U.S. under their [...] "International Classics" [...] banner. Capitalizing on the commercial success of the film, Argento and Daria Nicolodi, who had co-written the screenplay, announced that Suspiria was only {{the first of a}} proposed trilogy which they referred to as [...] "The Three Mothers" [...] trilogy. The basic concept of all three films is derived from Thomas de Quincey's Suspiria de Profundis, a sequel to his Confessions of an English Opium-Eater. A prose poem of the book entitled [...] "Levana and Our Ladies of Sorrow", details how, just as there are three Fates and three Graces, there are also three Sorrows: Mater Lachrymarum (The Lady of Tears), Mater Suspiriorum (The Lady of <b>Sighs)</b> <b>and</b> Mater Tenebrarum (The Lady of Darkness). As the title suggests, Suspiria focused on Mater Suspiriorum; the evil sister featured in Inferno is Mater Tenebrarum. The concluding chapter of Argento's trilogy, The Mother of Tears (2007), is about Mater Lachrymarum.|$|E
