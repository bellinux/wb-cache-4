5|$|GMAW with {{globular}} {{metal transfer}} {{is considered the}} least desirable {{of the three major}} GMAW variations, because of its tendency to produce high heat, a poor weld surface, and spatter. The method was originally developed as a cost efficient way to weld steel using GMAW, because this variation uses carbon dioxide, a less expensive shielding gas than argon. Adding to its economic advantage was its high deposition rate, allowing welding speeds of up to 110mm/s (250in/min). As the weld is made, a ball of molten metal from the electrode tends to build up {{on the end of the}} electrode, often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than the electrode itself. When the droplet finally detaches either by gravity or <b>short</b> <b>circuiting,</b> it falls to the workpiece, leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter. As a result of the large molten droplet, the process is generally limited to flat and horizontal welding positions, requires thicker workpieces, and results in a larger weld pool.|$|E

25|$|Railway tunnels {{built in}} Norway during the 1990s and 2000s had been plagued with leaks. These can stop all traffic is the water drips on {{technical}} installations, causing <b>short</b> <b>circuiting.</b> To avoid such issues, the National Rail Administration chose to instead build the tunnel with concrete lining. This involved that the tunnel was built with a waterproof plastic membrane {{on the inside}} of the concrete. The administration estimates this increases the tunnel's lifetime from 50 to 100 years. This alternative was used in both the Ulvin Tunnel and the two other tunnels in the project. It received criticism from some researchers, who stated that a membrane was unnecessarily expensive, that it is near impossible to repair any breaches which might occur and that use of foreign technology could weaken Norway's international reputation in tunneling.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{the typical}} circuit, the spark gap's <b>short</b> <b>circuiting</b> action {{prevents}} high-frequency oscillations from 'backing up' into the supply transformer. In the alternate circuit, high amplitude high frequency oscillations that appear across the capacitor also are applied to the supply transformer's winding. This can induce corona discharges between turns that weaken and eventually destroy the transformer's insulation. Experienced Tesla coil builders almost exclusively use the top circuit, often augmenting it with low pass filters (resistor and capacitor (RC) networks) between the supply transformer and spark gap to help protect the supply transformer. This is especially important when using transformers with fragile high-voltage windings, such as neon sign transformers (NSTs). Regardless of which configuration is used, the HV transformer must be of a type that self-limits its secondary current by means of internal leakage inductance. A normal (low leakage inductance) high-voltage transformer must use an external limiter (sometimes called a ballast) to limit current. NSTs are designed to have high leakage inductance to limit their short circuit current to a safe level.|$|E

500|$|The {{desirable}} rate of shielding-gas flow depends {{primarily on}} weld geometry, speed, current, {{the type of}} gas, and the metal transfer mode. Welding flat surfaces requires higher flow than welding grooved materials, since gas disperses more quickly. Faster welding speeds, in general, mean that more gas must be supplied to provide adequate coverage. Additionally, higher current requires greater flow, and generally, more helium is required to provide adequate coverage than if argon is used. Perhaps most importantly, the four primary variations of GMAW have differing shielding gas flow requirementsfor the small weld pools of the <b>short</b> <b>circuiting</b> and pulsed spray modes, about 10L/min (20ft³/h) is generally suitable, whereas for globular transfer, around 15L/min (30ft³/h) is preferred. [...] The spray transfer variation normally requires more shielding-gas flow because of its higher heat input and thus larger weld pool. Typical gas-flow amounts are approximately 2025L/min (4050ft³/h).|$|E

60|$|Now Heartbreak House, with Butler and Bergson and Scott Haldane {{alongside}} Blake and {{the other}} major poets on its shelves (to say nothing of Wagner and the tone poets), was not so completely blinded by the doltish materialism of the laboratories as the uncultured world outside. But being an idle house it was a hypochondriacal house, always running after cures.

It was superstitious, and addicted to table-rapping, materialization seances, clairvoyance, palmistry, crystal-gazing and the like to such an extent that it may be doubted whether ever before in the history of the world did soothsayers, astrologers, and unregistered therapeutic specialists of all sorts flourish as they did during this half century of the drift to the abyss. The registered doctors and surgeons were hard put to it to compete with the unregistered. They were not clever enough to appeal to the imagination and sociability of the Heartbreakers by the arts of the actor, the orator, the poet, the winning conversationalist. They had to fall back coarsely on the terror of infection and death. They prescribed inoculations and operations. Whatever part of a human being could be cut out without necessarily killing him they cut out; and he often died (unnecessarily of course) in consequence. From such trifles as uvulas and tonsils they went on to ovaries and appendices until at last no one's inside was safe. They explained that the human intestine was too long, and that nothing could make a child of Adam healthy except <b>short</b> <b>circuiting</b> the pylorus by cutting a length out of the lower intestine and fastening it directly to the stomach. As their mechanist theory taught them that medicine was the business of the chemist's laboratory, and surgery of the carpenter's shop, and also that Science (by which they meant their practices) was so important that no consideration for the interests of any individual creature, whether frog or philosopher, much less the vulgar commonplaces of sentimental ethics, could weigh for a moment against the remotest off-chance of an addition to the body of scientific knowledge, they operated and vivisected and inoculated and lied on a stupendous scale, clamoring for and actually acquiring such legal powers over the bodies of their fellow-citizens as neither king, pope, nor parliament dare ever have claimed. The Inquisition itself was a Liberal institution compared to the General Medical Council.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This paper studies dynamic {{characteristics}} of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in the pulsed current {{gas metal arc}} welding (GMAW-P). Design/methodology/approach: Welding experiments with different values of pulsing parameter and simultaneous recording of high speed camera pictures and welding signals (such as current and voltage) were used to identify different <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> conditions in GMAW-P. The investigation is based on the synchronization of welding signals and high speed camera to characterize different types of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> occurring in GMAW-P system. The behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> under the influence of different pulsing conditions is also investigated. Findings: It will be shown in the paper that <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P occurs in different forms which can be categorized depending upon time of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> and phase (peak or base time) of the pulse. Further investigation involves study of the dynamic behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> with variation of different pulsing parameters. Research limitations/implications: The results show that by varying the pulse parameters, behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P is changed. The pulse parameters can be adjusted to avoid occurrence of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P. Future work should concentrate on development of practical indices in terms of pulse welding parameters for quantitative estimation of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> occurrence and avoidance. Originality/value: Determination of proper working parameters with GMAW-P is crucial for the appropriate selection of pulse welding parameters. As short-circuiting is common between the welding electrode and the workpiece in GMAW-P, so in order to estimate the working parameters and ensure stable GMAW-P understanding dynamic behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P will be useful. However, in case of aluminum hardly any attempt is made to analyse the dynamic behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P.

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{discusses}} several {{methods of}} detecting occurrence of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> and <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> severity in pulse {{gas metal arc}} welding process (GMAW-P). Design/methodology/approach: Welding experiments with different values of pulsing parameter and simultaneous recording of high speed camera pictures and welding signals (such as current and voltage) were used to identify the occurrence of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> and its severity in GMAW-P process. The investigation is based on the measurement of welding signals specifically current and voltage signals and their synchronization with high speed camera to investigate the <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> phenomenon in GMAW-P process. Findings: The results reveal that <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> can be detected using signal processing techniques and its severity can be predicted by using statistical models and artificial intelligence techniques in GMAW-P process. Research limitations/implications: Several factors are responsible for <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> occurrence in GMAW-P process. The results show that voltage and current signal carry rich information about the metal transfer and especially <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> occurrence in GMAW-P process. Hence it’s possible to detect <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> occurrence in GMAW-P process.
