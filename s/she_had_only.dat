5|$|One of Maria Theresa's {{greatest}} wishes {{was to have}} as many grandchildren as possible, but <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> {{about two}} dozen {{at the time of her}} death, of which all the eldest surviving daughters were named after her, with the exception of Caroline of Parma, her eldest granddaughter by Maria Amalia.|$|E
5|$|Albert Edward and Alexandra visited Ireland in April 1868. After {{her illness}} the {{previous}} year, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> {{just begun to}} walk again {{without the aid of}} two walking sticks, and was already pregnant with her fourth child. The royal couple undertook a six-month tour taking in Austria, Egypt and Greece over 1868 and 1869, which included visits to her brother King George I of Greece, to the Crimean battlefields and (for her only) to the harem of the Khedive Ismail. In Turkey she became the first woman to sit down to dinner with the Sultan (Abdülâziz).|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} early van der Weyden {{depictions of the}} Madonna, her head is {{slightly}} too large for her body. Her dress is creased and almost paper-like. However, the description of her lap contains inconsistencies also in Campin's Virgin and Child before a Firescreen; it appears to lack volume and is if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> one leg. This seems to reflect an early difficulty both with foreshortening and in the depiction of a body under clothing.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} of the separation and constant press attention began to take its toll of Carey. Growing creative differences with producer Walter Afanasieff ended their working relationship, after collaborating on most of Carey's previous output. The breaking point came after a heated argument during a long recording session, over the album's musical direction. Carey also faced media criticism over her choice of producers and several newspapers linked Carey romantically to several rappers, suggesting these relationships influenced her decisions. However, Carey denied the allegations, stating <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> slept with her husband.|$|E
5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to {{how they}} had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char patterns on the house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and the trail of accelerant had ended {{at the door of the}} master bedroom, which had been open while the fire burned. The state of the bedroom door contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her bedroom door had been closed and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> opened it briefly to look into the hallway.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1944, {{the ship}} was due for another overhaul; work was to have lasted for three months. The Soviet Army had {{advanced}} so far, however, {{that it was necessary}} to move the ship farther away from the front, despite the fact that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> one working turbine. On 29 January 1945, the ship left Gotenhafen, arriving in Kiel on 2 February. She entered the Germaniawerft shipyard for refitting. On 3 May, RAF bombers attacked the harbor and severely damaged the ship. Her crew scuttled the wrecked ship at her moorings at 04:25 on 3 May. In July 1945, {{after the end of the}} war, Admiral Hipper was raised and towed to Heikendorfer Bay and subsequently broken up for scrap in 1948–1952. Her bell was on display at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. The bell has since been returned to Germany and is on display at the Laboe Naval Memorial.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September 2012, Tan won Singapore's first {{medal at}} the 2012 Summer Paralympics, a bronze in the {{dressage}} Individual Championship Test (class Ia). Riding on Ruben James 2, a gelding from Germany <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> known for ten months, she scored 73.650 percentage points. Two days later, on 4 September, she scored 79.000 in the Individual Freestyle Test (class Ia) which brought her a silver medal. Her wins brought her prizes of $50,000 (for her bronze medal) and $100,000 (silver) from the SNPC's Athletes Achievement Awards scheme, again leading to comments about the stark difference between the cash prizes that Olympic and Paralympic medallists receive. Twenty per cent of the prize money will {{be paid to the}} Singapore National Paralympic Council for training and development. For her achievements, Tan won The Straits Times newspaper's Star of the Month for September, and was conferred a Bintang Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Star) by the President on 11 November 2012.|$|E
5|$|While <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> {{competed in}} ten races {{during her first}} World Cup winter, Neuner became a fixture in the German team in the 2006–07 season. She proved {{to be one of}} the fastest {{cross-country}} skiers in biathlon, and at 19 years old, regularly set the fastest course times. On 5 January 2007, Neuner won her first World Cup event, the sprint race in Oberhof, Germany. Her victory on home soil, before a crowd of 19,000 people, received considerable media attention and put her into the national spotlight for the first time. Two days later at the pursuit race, she forgot to reload her rifle after warm-up. She was handed a new magazine during the prone shooting and managed to finish third despite a total of six shooting errors.|$|E

5|$|At 17:00, {{the leading}} French ship of the line, Magnanime, came within range with her bow chasers. Calcutta {{continued}} sailing southwards, remaining {{ahead of the}} squadron but not at a sufficient distance to avoid Magnanimes fire. Realising that unless he took drastic measures his ship would be caught, Woodriff turned Calcutta back towards Magnanime, hoping to disable her before the next ship in line, the frigate Thétis, could join the battle. Captain Pierre-François Violette on Magnanime prepared to meet Calcutta and the engagement rapidly became furious, Calcutta and Magnanime exchanging full broadsides at close range. Within 45 minutes, {{it was clear that}} Woodriff's gamble had failed. The larger and more powerful Magnanime inflicted severe damage to the British ship's rigging, rendering her unable to manoeuvre or escape, with the remainder of the French squadron bearing down. With defeat inevitable, Woodriff spared the lives of his men by striking his colours and surrendering to Violette. Although Calcutta was badly damaged among her rigging and sails, her hull had suffered little from the engagement and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> lost six killed and six wounded. French casualties were negligible, although Armide was forced to undergo extensive temporary repairs on her own sails and rigging before she was able to operate as a scout once more. Brothers had also been captured: the corvette Sylphe had separated during the chase and rapidly overhauled the lumbering merchant ship, which had surrendered without a fight.|$|E
5|$|The c.1800 {{manuscript}} {{also stated}} that the flag was once held in an iron chest, within Dunvegan Castle. The key to the chest was then always {{in the possession of}} the hereditary flag bearers. The c.1800 manuscript related how, on the death of the MacLeod chief Tormod, son of lain Breac, the succession to the chiefship nearly fell to the family of the MacLeods of Talisker. The young widow of the last chief refused to give up Dunvegan Castle to the next heir, knowing herself to be pregnant (although <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> been married six weeks previous to her widowhood). In time, she gave birth to Tormod, the next chief. The c.1800 manuscript stated that at around this time, a man who wished to curry favour with the expectant heir (MacLeod of Talisker) attempted to steal the flag. Even though the Fairy Flag was later found, both the staff and iron chest were never seen again. Historically, the old chief, Tormod (son of Iain Breac), died in the autumn of 1706, and his son, Tormod, was born in July 1705.|$|E
