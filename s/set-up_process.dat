50|$|In some cases, UC {{management}} vendors opt {{not to try}} {{to standardize}} the <b>set-up</b> <b>processes,</b> as this is seen to be too complex. Instead they perform a “sync” process with the application servers to learn what configuration has been applied. This approach limits these management tools to purely an administrative role for change management (otherwise known as “moves, adds, changes and deletes MACDs). The initial configuration of the UC servers and the network infrastructure is still performed manually by engineers and the UC automation is applied to a fully working system. This limits the benefits, but is a simple to apply management approach.|$|R

50|$|Although {{great strides}} {{have been made}} in terms of quality, {{manufactured}} homes do still struggle with construction problems. Author Wes Johnson has pointed out that the HUD code which governs manufactured homes desperately needs to be updated, quality control at manufacturing facilities are often lax, and set-up issues often compromise even a well-made manufactured home. Johnson states buyers need to be exceptionally cautious if they are entertaining the idea of purchasing any manufactured home by carefully checking it for defects before signing the contract and supervising the <b>set-up</b> <b>process</b> closely. These homes in the modern age are built to be beautiful and last longer than the typical old trailers.|$|E
50|$|In the {{hierarchy}} of manufacturing machines, the screw machine sits at the top when large product volumes are needed. An engine lathe sits at the bottom, taking {{the least amount of}} time to set up but the most amount of skilled labor and time to actually produce a part. A turret lathe has traditionally been one step above an engine lathe, needing greater set-up time but being able to produce a higher volume of product and usually requiring a lower-skilled operator once the <b>set-up</b> <b>process</b> is complete. Screw machines may require an extensive set-up, but once they are running, a single operator can monitor the operation of several machines.|$|E
50|$|While 8254 and RTC can, {{similarly}} to HPET, {{be put in}} one-shot mode, the <b>set-up</b> <b>process</b> is so slow that their one-shot mode is not used in practice for tasks requiring precise scheduling. Instead, 8254 and RTC are typically used in periodic mode with a very small time interval. For example, if an application needs to perform several short (some milliseconds, perhaps) waits, {{it is better to}} have a periodic timer running constantly with a 1 ms period because of the high setup cost of an 8254 or RTC one-shot timer. This causes an interrupt at every millisecond even if the application needs to do actual work less frequently. With HPET, the extra interrupts can be avoided, because the set-up cost of a HPET one-shot timer is considerably smaller.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the {{conditions}} under which capability, transaction and scale considerations interact in determining organisational boundaries. I will argue that this interaction contributes to explaining the individual firm’s performance and growth whenever cognitive competence is limited, radical uncertainty is present, some inputs and processes are indivisible and complementary, and some relevant knowledge is tacit, non-transmittable and characterised by <b>set-up</b> <b>processes</b> with high fixed costs. Under the above conditions, which are becoming increasingly important with the spread of the knowledge-based economy, the growth of the firm can be regarded as a consequence of managerial ability to set a strategy that exploits the mutually reinforcing advantages provided by the organisational coordination of capabilities, transactions and scale of processes, while limiting counteracting forces deriving from errors of strategy that are due to cognitive inertia and myopia, unclear allocation of rights and responsibilities, errors in identifying aims, imprecision in performance measuring, difficulty in focusing incentives, influence activities and problems of internal communication...|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Jobs {{once again}} {{delivered}} the keynote {{presentation at the}} WWDC, which was held from August 7 to 11 in Moscone Center West, San Francisco. The Mac Pro was announced as a replacement to the Power Mac G5, which was Apple's prior pro desktop computer and the last remaining PowerPC-based Mac. The standard Mac Pro featured two 2.66 GHz dual core Xeon (Woodcrest) processors, 1 GB RAM, 250 GB hard drive, and a 256 MB video card. An Xserve update, based on the dual core Xeons, was also announced. Redundant power and Lights Out Management were further product improvements to Apple's server lineup. While certain key Mac OS X improvements were undisclosed, there were 10 improvements in the next iteration, Mac OS X Leopard (10.5), including: full 64-bit app support, Time Machine, Boot Camp, Front Row, Photo Booth, Spaces (Virtual Desktops), Spotlight enhancements, Core Animation, Universal Access enhancements, Mail enhancements, and Dashboard enhancements (including Dashcode, and iChat enhancements). Along with the Leopard features that were announced, a major revision to the Mac OS X Server product was announced. New features to the Server included: a simplified <b>set-up</b> <b>process,</b> iCal Server (based on the CalDAV standard), Apple Teams (a set of web-based collaborative services), Spotlight Server, and Podcast Producer. The 2006 WWDC attracted 4,200 developers from 48 countries, while there were 140 sessions and 100 hands-on labs for developers. More than 1,000 Apple engineers were present at the event, and the DJ BT performed at the Apple Campus in Cupertino.|$|E
40|$|Surveys {{have shown}} that, in general, {{developing}} countries tend {{to regulate the}} set-up processes for firms more intensively than developed countries. In particular, while many developing countries tend to integrate licensing requirements in the <b>set-up</b> <b>process</b> ('set-up licensing'), the more developed countries generally use licensing procedures independent of the <b>set-up</b> <b>process</b> ('independent licensing'). Set-up licensing requirements must be met before an enterprise can lawfully exist and operate in any respect. In contrast, an independent licensing system merely requires authorisation for the particular activities {{that are to be}} controlled, and this does not affect the right of the firm to exist and engage in other business activities. More importantly, set-up licensing may impose more compliance costs on entrepreneurs, more administrative costs on officials and more welfare losses on consumers than independent licensing. In this paper we explore the distinction to see whether the widespread preference for set-up licensing in developing countries can be justified on public interest grounds, or at least explained on private interest grounds.

40|$|Today's WiFi {{networks}} {{deliver a}} large fraction of traffic. However, {{the performance and}} quality of WiFi networks are still far from satisfactory. Among many popular quality metrics (throughput, latency), the probability of successfully connecting to WiFi APs and the time cost of the WiFi connection <b>set-up</b> <b>process</b> are the {{two of the most}} critical metrics that affect WiFi users' experience. To understand the WiFi connection <b>set-up</b> <b>process</b> in real-world settings, we carry out measurement studies on 5 million mobile users from 4 representative cities associating with 7 million APs in 0. 4 billion WiFi sessions, collected from a mobile "WiFi Manager" App that tops the Android/iOS App market.

Based on the measurement analysis, we develop a machine learning based AP selection strategy that can significantly improve WiFi connection set-up performance, against the conventional strategy purely based on signal strength, by reducing the connection set-up failures from 33 % to 3. 6 % and reducing 80 % time costs of the connection set-up processes by more than 10 times.

In addition, harmonic analysis of the profile produced on the workpiece was carried out to study in details the profile characteristics such as the amplitude spectrum, the dominant harmonic and the average undulation number.

CLASS III HOMEODOMAIN LEUCINE ZIPPER (HD-ZIPIII) transcription factors are involved in embryo, shoot and root patterning. During vegetative growth HD-ZIPIII proteins control several polarity <b>set-up</b> <b>processes</b> such as in leaves and the vascular system. We have identified several direct target genes of the HD-ZIPIII transcription factor REVOLUTA (REV) using a chromatin immunoprecipitation/DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq) approach. This analysis revealed that REV acts upstream of auxin biosynthesis and affects directly the expression of several class II HD-ZIP transcription factors that have been shown to act in the shade-avoidance response pathway. We show that, as well as involvement in basic patterning, HD-ZIPIII transcription factors have a critical role in the control of the elongation growth that is induced when plants experience shade. Leaf polarity is established by the opposed actions of HD-ZIPIII and KANADI transcription factors. Finally, our study reveals that the module that consists of HD-ZIPIII/KANADI transcription factors controls shade growth antagonistically and that this antagonism is manifested in the opposed regulation of shared target genes...|$|R

50|$|The term junkyard {{computing}} is a colloquial {{expression for}} using old or inferior hardware to fulfill computational tasks while handling {{reliability and availability}} on software level. It utilizes abstraction of computational resources via software, allowing hardware replacement at very low effort. Ease of replacement is hereby a corner point since hardware failures are expected at any time due to {{the condition of the}} underlying infrastructure. This paradigm became more widely used with the introduction of cluster orchestration software like Kubernetes or Apache Mesos, since large monolithic applications require reliability and availability on machine level whereas this kind of software is fault tolerant by design. Those orchestration tools also introduced fairly fast <b>set-up</b> <b>processes</b> allowing to use junkyard computing economically and even making this pattern applicable in the first place. Further use cases were introduced when continuous delivery was getting more widely accepted. Infrastructure to execute tests and static code analysis was needed which requires as much performance as possible while being extremely cost effective. From an economical and technological perspective, junkyard computing is only practicable for a small amount of users or companies. It already requires a descend amount of physical machines to compensate hardware failures while maintaining the required reliability and availability. This implies a direct need for a matching underling infrastructure to house all the computers and servers. Scaling this paradigm is also quite limited due to the increasing importance of factors like power efficiency and maintenance efforts, making this kind of computing perfect for mid-sized applications.|$|R
