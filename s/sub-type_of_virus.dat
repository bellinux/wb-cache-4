40|$|The {{ability of}} the {{influenza}} Orthomixovirus to undergo to continually antigenically changes that can affect its pathogenicity and its diffusion, explains the growing seriousness of this disease and the recent epizoozies {{in various parts of}} the world. There have been 15 HA and 9 NA type A <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> the influenza <b>virus</b> identified all <b>of</b> which are present in birds. Until now the very virulent avian influenza viruses identified were all included to the H 5 and H 7 sub-types. We here show that is possible to identify the H 5 and H 7 sub-types with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) by using a set of specific primers for each HA sub-type. The RT-PCR is a quick and sensitive method of identifying the HA <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> the influenza <b>virus</b> directly from homogenised organs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{previously}} isolated nucleic acid ligands (aptamers) that bind the surface envelope glycoprotein, gp 120, of HIV- 1, and neutralize infection <b>of</b> diverse <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus.</b> Our earlier studies {{have identified the}} overall structure {{of one of these}} aptamers, B 40, and have indicated that it binds to gp 120 in a manner that competes with that of the HIV- 1 coreceptor, CCR 5, and select “CD 4 i” antibodies with epitopes overlapping this region. Here, we sought to map the B 40 binding site on gp 120 more precisely by analysing its interaction with a panel of alanine substitution mutants of gp 120. Furthermore, we tested our hypothesis concerning the structure of the 40 nucleotide functional core of the aptamer by the solid-phase synthesis of truncated and chemically modified derivatives. The results confirm our structural predictions and demonstrate that aptamer B 40 neutralizes a diverse range of HIV- 1 isolates as a result of binding to relatively conserved residues on gp 120 {{at the heart of the}} CCR 5 -binding site. These structural insights may provide the basis for the development of potential anti-viral agents with high specificity and robustness...|$|R
40|$|Comparisons <b>of</b> {{residues}} between <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> influenza <b>virus</b> {{is increasingly}} {{used to assess}} the zoonotic potential of a circulating strain and for comparative studies across subtypes. An analysis of N-terminal cleavage sites for thirteen subtypes of influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) sequences, has previously been described by Nobusawa and colleagues. We have expanded this analysis for the eighteen known subtypes of influenza. Due to differences in the length of HA, we have included strains from multiple clades of H 1 and H 5, as well as strains of H 5 and H 7 subtypes with both high and low pathogenicity. Analysis of known structures of influenza A HA enables us to define amino acids which are structurally and functionally equivalent across all HA subtypes using a numbering system based on the mature HA sequence. We provide a list of equivalences for amino acids which are known to affect the phenotype <b>of</b> the <b>virus...</b>|$|R

Previous studies showed a geographical distribution <b>of</b> genotypically distinct <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> EBV. <b>Viruses</b> detected at a higher frequency among Chinese NPC patients (Cf) were distinguished from {{those found in the}} majority of Caucasian NPC patients (Up) in the United States by polymorphisms in the BamHI F and I regions. Exploiting this distinction, we analyzed the biopsies of Chinese immigrants in the United States far their C/D and F/f genotypes to evaluate the importance of retention <b>of</b> the Cf <b>virus</b> among Chinese NPC patients in a geographical area where the DF virus prevails. This study shows that approximately 45. 5 to 50 % of first- and second-generation Chinese NPC patients in California harbor the Cf virus, which is present in only 8 % of Caucasian NPC patients in California. It is interesting that, while only 48 % of the viral isolates from immigrant Chinese to California harbor the 'f' variant, 96 % harbor the type-C viruses. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|AnH 10 N 8 avian {{influenza}} virus (AIV), designated A/Duck/Guangdong/E 1 / 2012 (H 10 N 8), was isolated from a duck in January 2012. This is first report that this subtype of AIV was isolated from a live bird market (LBM) in Guangdong Province in southern China. Furthermore, the complete genome of this strain was analyzed. The availability of genome sequences {{is helpful to}} further investigations of epidemiology andmolecular characteristics of AIV in southern China. InfluenzaAvirus belongs to the familyOrthomyxoviridae (3). Basedon the antigenic properties of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neur-aminidase (NA) glycoproteins, influenza A viruses are classified into 17 HA and 10 NA subtypes (8, 9). Most subtypes <b>of</b> influenza A <b>virus</b> {{have been found in}} aquatic birds, which are the natural reservoir <b>of</b> influenza A <b>virus</b> (9). For a long time, southern China has been con-sidered ahypothetical epicenter for facilitating the emergenceof pan-demic influenza viruses in the world (6). In recent years, several <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> {{avian influenza}} <b>viruses</b> (AIVs) have been circulating and evolving in southernChina, includingH 3,H 5,H 6, andH 9 (1, 2, 4, 5, 7).

40|$|GB Virus Type C (GBV-C), a {{blood-borne}} flavivirus currently infects {{about one}} sixth of the world’s population. Its transmission {{has been reported}} through parenteral, sexual and vertical routes. Unusually for RNA viruses, it exhibits {{a high degree of}} conservation of the polyprotein sequence. The geographical distribution of GBV-C suggests an African origin and a long-term co-evolution in the human population but without any known pathogenicity. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the different <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> this <b>virus</b> in Southern Cameroon. We studied the genetic epidemiology of GBV-C among rural populations where many HIV- 1 and HCV genotypes have been identified. Plasma samples of 345 subjects with evidence of HCV exposure were tested for GBV-C infection. To detect GBV-C RNA, reverse transcription followed by a nested PCR of 5 ’UTR were performed. Direct sequencing and phylogenetic studies using PHYLIP, PAUP* and SimPlot were carried out. In total, 31 GBV-C RNA-positive samples were detected giving a prevalence of 9. 0 % among HCV-exposed individuals. Phylogenetic analysis of the 5 ’UTR showed two distinct clusters: Genotype 1 and Genotype 2. Twenty-eight isolates (8. 0 %) clustered with Genotype 1 and 3 (1. 0 %) with Genotype 2. More than one genotype of GBV-C is prevalent in Cameroon of which GBV-C Genotype 1 is more common, confirming reports in the literature. Studying the near full-length genome sequences of GBV-C isolates from primates in this region may provide clues of viral recombination, evolution and origin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Continuous {{outbreaks}} {{of the highly}} pathogenic H 5 N 1 avian influenza A in Asia has resulted in an urgent effort to improve current diagnostics to aid containment <b>of</b> the <b>virus</b> and lower {{the threat of a}} influenza pandemic. We report here the development of a PCR-based assay that is highly specific for the H 5 N 1 avian influenza A virus. Methods A one-step reverse-transcription PCR assay was developed to detect the H 5 N 1 avian influenza A <b>virus.</b> The specificity <b>of</b> the assay was shown by testing <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> influenza A <b>virus</b> and other viral and bacterial pathogens; and on field samples. Results Validation on 145 field specimens from Vietnam and Malaysia showed that the assay was specific without cross reactivity to a number of other infuenza strains as well as human respiratory related pathogens. Detection was 100 % from allantoic fluid in H 5 N 1 positive samples, suggesting it to be a reliable sampling source for accurate detection. Conclusion The assay developed from this study indicates that the primers are specific for the H 5 N 1 influenza virus. As shown by the field tested results, this assay would be highly useful as a diagnostic tool to help identify and control influenza epidemics. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEbola hemorrhagic fever, {{caused by}} the highly virulent RNA <b>virus</b> <b>of</b> the filoviridae family, {{has become one of}} the world's most feared pathogens. The virus induces acute fever and death, often {{associated}} with hemorrhagic symptoms in up to 90 % of infected patients. The known <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> the <b>virus</b> are Zaire, Sudan, Taï Forest, Bundibugyo and Reston Ebola viruses. In the past, outbreaks were limited to the East and Central African tropical belt with the exception of Ebola Reston outbreaks that occurred in animal facilities in the Philippines, USA and Italy. The on-going outbreak in West Africa that is causing numerous deaths and severe socio-economic challenges has resulted in widespread anxiety globally. This panic may be attributed to the intense media interest, the rapid spread <b>of</b> the <b>virus</b> to other countries like United States and Spain, and moreover, to the absence of an approved treatment or vaccine. Informed by this widespread fear and anxiety, we analyzed the commonly used strategies to manage and control Ebola outbreaks and proposed new approaches that could improve epidemic management and control during future outbreaks. We based our recommendations on epidemic management practices employed during recent outbreaks in East, Central and West Africa, and synthesis of peer-reviewed publications as well as published “field” information from individuals and organizations recently involved in the management of Ebola epidemics. The current epidemic management approaches are largely “reactive”, with containment efforts aimed at halting spread of existing outbreaks. We recommend that for better outcomes, in addition to “reactive” interventions, “pre-emptive” strategies also need to be instituted. We conclude that emphasizing both “reactive” and “pre-emptive” strategies is more likely to lead to better epidemic preparedness and response at individual, community, institutional, and government levels, resulting in timely containment of future Ebola outbreaks...|$|R

Approximately 90 % of new HIV- 1 infections occur in developing countries, including the Caribbean. However, information on HIV- 1 subtypes from this region is limited. We report <b>sub-type</b> characterization <b>of</b> <b>viruses</b> from 71 individuals, obtained {{during the period}} 2000 – 2002. RNA from the pol region was sequenced, generating data on subtype and drug resistance associated mutations for 71 spec-imens from 9 countries. Sixty-seven (94. 4 %) sequences were classified as clade B, three (4. 2 %) as D/B, and one (1. 4 %) as clade C. Numerous polymorphisms were observed, including some associated with drug resis-tance, but not signifying exposure to chemotherapy. This study adds to our knowledge of HIV- 1 clades in the Caribbean, and indicates possibilities for monitoring HIV- 1 chemotherapy. 929 ELEVEN SUBTYPES OF M-GROUP HIV- 1, A to K, have beendescribed to date, {{and there is no}} apparent linear descent relationship between clades. 1 They may have varying biologi-cal properties and display different geographical distributions and prevalences, necessitating a need for regional characteri-zation and surveillance. In the absence of surveillance, the emergence of new clades in a region may result in an underes-timate {{of the impact of the}} epidemic.
