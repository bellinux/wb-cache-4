50|$|Rambus DRAM (RDRAM), and its successors Concurrent Rambus DRAM (CRDRAM) and Direct Rambus DRAM (DRDRAM), are {{types of}} <b>synchronous</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>RAM</b> {{developed}} by Rambus from the late-1980s {{through to the}} early-2000s. The third-generation of Rambus DRAM, DRDRAM was replaced by XDR DRAM. Rambus DRAM was developed for high-bandwidth applications, and was positioned by Rambus as replacement for various types of contemporary memories, such as SDRAM.|$|E
50|$|Early {{types of}} system memory (RAM), such as SDRAM, {{transmitted}} data on only the rising {{edge of the}} clock signal. With the advent of double data rate <b>synchronous</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>RAM</b> or DDR SDRAM, the data was transmitted on both rising and falling edges. However, quad-pumping {{has been used for}} a while for the front side bus (FSB) of a computer system. This works by transmitting data at the rising edge, peak, falling edge, and trough of each clock cycle. Intel computer systems (and others) use this technology to reach effective FSB speeds of 1600 MT/s (million transfers per second), even though the FSB clock speed is only 400 MHz (cycles per second). A phase-locked loop in the CPU then multiplies the FSB clock by a factor {{in order to get the}} CPU speed.|$|E

Compared with a traditional PCI interfaced reconfigurable computing board, the DIMM interface offers higher bandwidth, a simpler interface and lower latency. A comparison of the transfer rate of the Pilchard board compared with a standard PCI 32 reconfigurable computing board is presented as well as an implementation of the data encryption standard (DES). Together, the board and interface generator provide an easy to use, low cost and high performance platform for reconfigurable computing. ...|$|E
40|$|Multi-core {{reconfigurable}} architectures where soft-cores can {{be programmed}} over a reconfigurable substrate {{such as in}} an FPGA are a reality. For these target architectures it will become imperative that high-level mapping tools can synthesize and estimate the impact of high-level transformations in the overall design in terms of speed and area. The lack of support for external memory operations in current synthesis tools substantially increases the complexity and the burden on designers in the mapping of applications to FPGA-based computing engines. In this paper we {{address the problem of}} synthesizing and estimating the area and speed of memory interfacing for Static RAM (SRAM) and <b>Synchronous</b> <b>Dynamic</b> <b>RAM</b> (SDRAM) with various latency parameters and access modes.

40|$|High speed {{networks}} require high throughput memories {{to store}} cells or packets. <b>Synchronous</b> <b>Dynamic</b> <b>RAM</b> (SDRAM) chips provide both high storage capacity and high throughput, {{and are thus}} an appropriate technology for building such cell or packet buffers. One 16 Mbit SDRAM chip with a 16 -bit data interface provides 40 K cell storage and 1. 2 Gbit/s throughputwhen used as an ATM cell buffer. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate this capability in a working prototype, gaining familiarity with the practical details of SDRAM and SONET operation, and PCB implementation with 100 MHz clocks. The prototype that was designed, manufactured and successfully tested, is an 8 -layer PCB with two SONET OC- 3 links (2 x 155. 52 Mbit/s incoming and 2 x 155. 52 Mbit/s outgoing throughput), interfaced to an SDRAM chip using two ALTERA FPGA's.

50|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>RAM</b> (DRAM) is {{very popular}} due to its cost effectiveness. If a {{computer}} has 1 gigabyte or 512 megabytes of RAM, the specification describes <b>dynamic</b> <b>RAM</b> (DRAM). DRAM stores each bit of information in a different capacitor within the integrated circuit. DRAM chips need just one single capacitor and one transistor to store each bit of information. This makes it space efficient and inexpensive.|$|R

[...] It is the higher-speed successor to DDR and DDR2 and predecessor to DDR4 <b>synchronous</b> <b>dynamic</b> random-access memory (SDRAM) chips. [...] DDR3 SDRAM is neither forward nor backward compatible with any earlier type of random-access memory (RAM) because of different signaling voltages, timings, and other factors.|$|R

Ed Roberts acknowledged the 4K <b>Dynamic</b> <b>RAM</b> board problems in the October 1975 Computer Notes. The price was reduced from $264 to $195 and existing purchasers got a $50 refund.

50|$|Volatile {{memory is}} {{computer}} memory that requires {{power to maintain}} the stored information. Most modern semiconductor volatile memory is either static <b>RAM</b> (SRAM) or <b>dynamic</b> <b>RAM</b> (DRAM). SRAM retains its contents {{as long as the}} power is connected and is easy for interfacing, but uses six transistors per bit. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>RAM</b> is more complicated for interfacing and control, needing regular refresh cycles to prevent losing its contents, but uses only one transistor and one capacitor per bit, allowing it to reach much higher densities and much cheaper per-bit costs.|$|R

50|$|DDR2 SDRAM is {{a double}} data rate <b>synchronous</b> <b>dynamic</b> random-access memory interface.

5000|$|ST MMU [...] "Memory Management Unit" [...] Provides signals {{needed for}} CPU/blitter/DMA and Shifter to access <b>dynamic</b> <b>RAM.</b> Even memory accesses {{are given to}} CPU/blitter/DMA while odd cycles are {{reserved}} for DRAM refresh or used by Shifter for displaying contents of the frame buffer.|$|R
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of static RAM (SRAM) {{is that it}} is much faster than <b>dynamic</b> <b>RAM.</b> Its disadvantage is its high price. SRAM does not need continuous electrical refreshes, but it still requires constant current to sustain the difference in voltage. In general, SRAM needs less power than DRAM, even though the power requirements differ based on the computer's clock speed. At moderate speeds SRAM usually requires just a fraction of the power used by DRAM. When idle, the power requirements of static RAM are low. Every single bit in a static RAM chip needs a cell of six transistors, whereas <b>dynamic</b> <b>RAM</b> requires only one capacitor and one transistor. As a result, SRAM is unable to accomplish the storage capabilities of the DRAM family.|$|R
50|$|The 21174 {{contains}} a memory controller and PCI controller. The memory controller supported up to 512 MB of <b>synchronous</b> <b>dynamic</b> {{random access memory}} (SDRAM) and accesses it via a 128-bit memory bus. The memory can be either ECC or parity protected. The PCI controller provided a PCI or PCI-X bus.|$|R
50|$|The Super-80 {{was based}} on the Zilog Z80 8-bit microprocessor. As standard, it had 16 kB of <b>dynamic</b> <b>RAM</b> in the form of eight 4116 RAM chips. RAM could be {{expanded}} to 32 kB or 48 kB through the addition of rows of eight 4116 RAM chips.|$|R
50|$|A {{memory bank}} {{is a logical}} unit of storage in electronics, which is hardware-dependent. In a computer, the memory bank may be {{determined}} by the memory controller along with physical organization of the hardware memory slots. In a typical <b>synchronous</b> <b>dynamic</b> random-access memory (SDRAM) or double data rate <b>synchronous</b> <b>dynamic</b> random-access memory (DDR SDRAM), a bank consists of multiple rows and columns of storage units, and is usually spread out across several chips. In a single read or write operation, only one bank is accessed, therefore the number of bits in a column or a row, per bank and per chip, equals the memory bus width in bits (single channel). The size of a bank is further determined by the number of bits in a column and a row, per chip, multiplied by the number of chips in a bank.|$|R
