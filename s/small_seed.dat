25|$|Since sesame is a small, flat seed, it is {{difficult}} to dry it after harvest because the <b>small</b> <b>seed</b> makes movement of air around the seed difficult. Therefore, the seeds need to be harvested as dry as possible and stored at 6% moisture or less. If the seed is too moist, it can quickly heat up and become rancid.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} seed size on the {{germination}} and seedling development {{was carried out}} on four local varieties of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L) walp), oloyin,drum, ifebrown and local white. Each of the varieties were sorted into big and <b>small</b> <b>seeds,</b> 100 seeds each of both big and <b>small</b> <b>seeds</b> of the four Varieties were weighed and the average weights were calculated and recorded. Six seeds of each sort were planted in a plastic pot filled with sandy-loamy soil in three replicates. Results of the various parameters studied revealed that germination efficiency was similar in both big and <b>small</b> <b>seeds</b> of drum, oloyin and ifebrown but not in <b>small</b> <b>seeds</b> of local white, weights of 100 seeds from big seeds were much heavier than those of <b>small</b> <b>seeds.</b> Number of leaves, leaf length, leaf breadth, leaf area, stem height and dry weight, were consistently higher in cowpea plants from big <b>seeds</b> than the <b>small</b> <b>seeds</b> of all the varieties. Number of seeds per pod was higher in cowpea from big seeds in all the varieties except in drum where number of seeds was higher in plants from <b>small</b> <b>seeds.</b> In general, seedlings emerging from big seeds of all the cowpea varieties performed better in all the parameters studied than those emerging from <b>smaller</b> <b>seeds...</b>|$|R

25|$|Although {{a number}} of {{artificial}} garnets were successfully grown, only two became important as diamond simulants. The first was yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG; Y3Al5O12) in the late 1960s. It was (and still is) produced by the Czochralski, or crystal-pulling, process, which involves growth from the melt. An iridium crucible surrounded by an inert atmosphere is used, wherein yttrium oxide and aluminium oxide are melted and mixed together at a carefully controlled temperature near 1980nbsp&°C. A <b>small</b> <b>seed</b> crystal {{is attached to a}} rod, which is lowered over the crucible until the crystal contacts the surface of the melted mixture. The seed crystal acts as a site of nucleation; the temperature is kept steady at a point where the surface of the mixture is just below the melting point. The rod is slowly and continuously rotated and retracted, and the pulled mixture crystallizes as it exits the crucible, forming a single crystal {{in the form of a}} cylindrical boule. The crystal's purity is extremely high, and it typically measures 5nbsp&cm (2nbsp&inches) in diameter and 20nbsp&cm (8nbsp&inches) in length, and weighs 9,000 carats (1.75nbsp&kg).|$|E
25|$|The {{founder of}} the nursery was Joachim Conrad Loddiges (1738–1826). He was born in Hildesheim, Lower Saxony; his father Casper Lochlies was a {{gardener}} to a nobleman in Wrisbergholzen, near Hannover. Conrad trained in The Netherlands and emigrated to Britain {{at the age of}} 19 during the Seven Years' War to take up employment as gardener for Dr J. B. Silvester in the suburban village of Hackney, north of London. It was then that the family name was anglicised. When in his forties he married, he had not accumulated sufficient savings to expand a <b>small</b> <b>seed</b> business started by fellow German émigré John Busch, which he purchased, together with the good will of Busch's clientele in 1771 and had fully paid for by 1777, by which time he began to write to people all over the world, urging them to send him packets of seeds collected from trips to native hills, valleys and plains. From these small beginnings, its initial catalogue appearing in 1777 the nursery business gained a specialist market in Britain, and was increasingly able to attract clients from estates and botanical gardens throughout Europe.|$|E

40|$|Grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) {{typically}} produces larger seeds than sudangrass [S. bicolor, formerly S. sudanense (Piper) Stapf); {{and grain}} sorghum seedlings are higher in hydrocyanic acid potential (HCN-p) than sudangrass seedlings. Previous {{studies have shown}} a seed-parent effect on seed weight and HCN-p in reciprocal F 1 hybrids of sorghum X sudangrass. This {{study was conducted to}} determine whether the seed-parent effect on HCN-p could be attributed primarily to the difference in seed size between reciprocal sorghum X sudangrass hybrids. Large and <b>small</b> <b>seeds</b> of low-HCN-p sudangrass, high-HCN-p sorghum, and their reciprocal hybrids, were visually selected, individually weighed, and planted in growth chambers. Height, fresh weight, and HCN-p of the resulting 7 -d-old shoots were measured. On average, the selected large seeds weighed ≈ 1. 6 times as much as the <b>small</b> <b>seeds.</b> Shoots from the large seeds were ≈ 1. 2 times as tall and 1. 4 times as heavy as those from <b>small</b> <b>seeds,</b> and they contained ≈ 1. 3 times as much HCN per shoot as did shoots from <b>small</b> <b>seeds.</b> However, the HCN-p (mg kg-I fresh wt.) of the shoots from large seeds was only slightly greater than that of shoots from <b>small</b> <b>seeds</b> (709 and 701 for first leaves of shoots, and 278 and 267 for shoot remainders from large and <b>small</b> <b>seeds,</b> respectively). Shoots from 5 -d-old light-grown and etiolated seedlings also failed to show appreciable differences in HCN-p due to seed size. It was concluded that the seed-parent effect on shoot HCN-p in crosses of sorghum and sudangrass was not caused primarily by the seed-parent effect on seed weight...|$|R
2500|$|On 2 January 1770, {{following}} his marriage, Joachim Conrad Loddiges {{wrote to his}} longstanding employer, Dr Silvester, asking for advice about his plan to move on from head gardener and grounds keeper, {{and set up a}} <b>small</b> <b>seed</b> and gardening business in the village of Hackney, north of London, with assistance from a fellow German emigree, Johann (syn. John) Busch. Busch was appointed as chief gardener to Catherine the Great and the two remained in contact - it is through this connection that the Loddiges had a role in importing and establishing rhubarb in Britain. Seed packets were received from all over the world, sometimes from well-known botanical explorers such as John Bartram and William Bartram in North America (who also favoured Quaker horticulturalists such as Peter Collinson with discoveries), and sometimes from ordinary travelers.|$|E

The name [...] "Sharwil" [...] is an amalgamation of Sharpe and Wilson (J.C. Wilson being the first propagator). Scions were sent from Australia to Hawaii in 1966. A medium-sized fruit with rough green skin, it closely resembles the 'Fuerte', but is slightly more oval in shape. The fruit has greenish-yellow flesh with a rich, nutty flavor and high oil content (20–24%), and a <b>small</b> <b>seed.</b> The skin is green when ripe. It represents more than 57% of the commercial farming in Hawaii, and represents up to 20% of all avocados grown in New South Wales, Australia.

After seeing one, I have often had to go half a mile or more to fetch my gun, and in nearly every case have found it on the same tree, or within a hundred yards, when I returned. I never saw two full-grown animals together, but both males and females are sometimes accompanied by half-grown young ones, while, at other times, three or four young ones were seen in company. Their food consists almost exclusively of fruit, with occasionally leaves, buds, and young shoots. They seem to prefer unripe fruits, some of which were very sour, others intensely bitter, particularly the large red, fleshy arillus of one which seemed an especial favourite. In other cases they eat only the <b>small</b> <b>seed</b> of a large fruit, and they almost always waste and destroy more than they eat, so that there is a continual rain of rejected portions below the tree they are feeding on. The Durian is an especial favourite, and quantities of this delicious fruit are destroyed wherever it grows surrounded by forest, but they will not cross clearings to get at them. It seems wonderful how the animal can tear open this fruit, the outer covering of which is so thick and tough, and closely covered with strong conical spines. It probably bites off a few of these first, and then, making a small hole, tears open the fruit with its powerful fingers.|$|E
