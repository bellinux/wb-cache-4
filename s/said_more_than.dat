40|$|Homeless {{children}} and youth in Illinois have the right under state and federal law to receive supports from their school districts to help them enroll, prevent school changes, and succeed in school. The federal government supplies some resources for school districts to achieve these goals, but the resources are far from adequate. A December 2013 statewide survey found that in a majority of school districts, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> half of homeless students who needed support were not getting the following services: 52 % <b>said</b> that <b>more</b> <b>than</b> half of homeless students did not receive tutoring 52 % <b>said</b> that <b>more</b> <b>than</b> half of homeless children that needed preschool did not access it. 56 % <b>said</b> that <b>more</b> <b>than</b> half of students did not receive counseling 58 % <b>said</b> that <b>more</b> <b>than</b> half of students did not receive help with public benefits 50 % <b>said</b> that <b>more</b> <b>than</b> half of students did not receive help with long-term housing 44 % said their capacity to identify and enroll homeless {{children and}} youth not in school was limited to very limited.

25|$|Despite {{the vast}} number of Washington-Franklin stamps released—as <b>said,</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 250 in seven {{different}} series—only five basic designs were employed during their printing and production. Two separate engravings—one of Washington, the other of Franklin—are used in the five basic design types. The engraving of George Washington was modeled after a bust (sculpture) by the celebrated sculptor Jean Antoine Houdon. The image of Franklin in this issue was engraved by Marcus Baldwin who modeled his engraving after {{a photograph of a}} plaster bust of Franklin created by Jean Jacques Caffieri in 1777. As the issue evolved through its seven series, Washington and Franklin replaced each other on some values—marking the first time in United States postal history that two men had appeared on the same denomination in one issue. Indeed, both Washington and Franklin ultimately appeared on the 1-cent, 8-cent, 10-cent, 13-cent, 15-cent, 50-cent and 1-dollar values.|$|E
25|$|Sales were {{encouraging}} {{throughout the}} holiday season, though sources vary {{on how many}} consoles were sold then. In 1986, Nintendo said it sold nearly 90,000 units in nine weeks during its 1985 New York City test run. Nintendo added Los Angeles as a test market in February 1986, followed by Chicago and San Francisco, then other top 12 US markets, and nationwide sales in September. It and Sega, which was similarly exporting its Master System to the US, planned to spend $15 million {{in the fourth quarter}} of 1986 to market their consoles; later, Nintendo said it planned to spend $16 million and Sega <b>said</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> $9 million. Nintendo obtained a distribution deal with toy company Worlds of Wonder, which leveraged its popular Teddy Ruxpin and Lazer Tag products to solicit more stores to carry the console. The largest retailer Sears sold it through its Christmas catalog and the second largest retailer Kmart sold it in 700 stores. Nintendo sold 1.1 million consoles in 1986, estimating that it could have sold 1.4 million if inventory had held out. Nintendo earned $310 million in sales, out of total 1986 video game industry sales of $430 million, compared to total 1985 industry sales of $100 million.|$|E
25|$|Even though Trami didn't made {{landfall}} {{over the}} Philippines, the storm did enhanced the southwest monsoon which brought extreme flooding {{throughout most of}} the country on August 18. Due to this, the government declares suspension of classes in some areas and PAGASA subsequently issued several rainfall advisories. Major areas in Metro Manila and nearby provinces reported severe flooding. The Marikina River as high as 19 meters, forcing authorities evacuate nearby residents. 8 people in the Philippines have been killed due to flooding. Monsoon rains are seen in Metro Manila, Regions I, IV-A, IV-B and V which may trigger flashfloods and landslides. Western Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula and the rest of Luzon will have cloudy skies with light to moderate rainshowers and thunderstorms, Pagasa added. The rest of the country will be partly cloudy to cloudy with isolated rainshowers or thunderstorms, it also <b>said.</b> <b>More</b> <b>than</b> half of Manila was flooded on the morning of August 20, although waters in some areas subsided by about 20 percent in the evening, authorities said. For two days, classes and work in government offices were suspended in Metro Manila and surrounding provinces of Laguna and Cavite, which bore the brunt of the heavy downpour. Laguna and Cavite, south of Manila, are where several foreign-funded industrial plants are located. According to an assessment by the Department of Science and Technology, rainfall reached 600mm (23.62 inches) in and around Manila Bay on August 18. Cebu is now the site of search operations for victims of a collision between the passenger ship MV Saint Thomas Aquinas 1 and the cargo vessel MV Sulpicio Express 7. At least 37 have been confirmed dead {{in the wake of the}} accident on the afternoon of August 18, which some 82 are still missing. The NDRRMC quickly mobilized units from the military and its reserves in response to critical areas being hit by rising floodwaters. Units from both MMDA and PNRC also responded to the call and pre-positioned its personnel along critical areas of Metro Manila. According to NDRRMC's last report on August 30, in total, Trami has caused P690 million ($15.4 million USD) of damage and killed a total of 27 people, in which 30 injured and 4 missing.|$|E

500|$|General Gage was {{understated}} in his {{casualty report}} to London: [...] "Two men {{were killed and}} a few wounded." [...] Others, however, apparently exaggerated, reporting large casualties. The Pennsylvania Journal reported on June 21, 1775, that General Gage himself recorded at least one hundred killed while other sources <b>said</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> three hundred. [...] From another source: [...] "The regulars {{were said to have}} suffered very much, not to have had less than two hundred killed and wounded. The loss was probably greatly exaggerated; that, however, had a good effect on the provincials. The affair was a matter of no small triumph to them and they felt upon the occasion more courageous than ever." [...] Gage ordered cannon mounted on Copp's Hill in Boston, and Vice-Admiral Graves moved the Somerset, which had been stationed in the shallow waters between Boston and Charlestown, into deeper waters to the east of Boston, where it would have improved maneuverability if fired upon from land. [...] He also belatedly sent a detachment of regulars to secure Noddle's Island; the Colonists had long before removed or destroyed anything of value on the island.|$|E
500|$|Following his {{retirement}} from professional Scouting, Goodman served the National Council of Churches (NCC) during 1951–1954 as the NCC's first general {{director of the}} United Church Men, a laymen's program he formed to strengthen men's ties to local churches and their communities. Goodman publicly inaugurated the laymen's group on October 7, 1951 in Cincinnati, Ohio. By the end of 1952, United Church Men departments were formed in more than 24states, providing financial support to NCC-affiliated colleges and missionary work. His new post entailed working closely with Eugene Carson Blake, NCC president (1954–1957), and meeting frequently with officials of the participating denominations in the NCC. Speaking with various men's church groups in the U.S. and abroad was, he believed, a means of promoting brotherhood. Reflecting on his NCC service with these notable church leaders, Goodman <b>said</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a decade later, [...] "Great faith and devoted service, I am very sure, are for ordinary folk {{as well as for}} the clergy. ... I have been privileged to know some great clergymen in my day ... but I have also known and loved some truly great laymen, men whose lives and works matched their faith". Goodman retired from his NCC post on September 1, 1954 because of tuberculosis.|$|E

500|$|Not every 20th-century critic opined {{primarily}} {{on the quality of}} the final lines when discussing the success or failure of the poem; Sidney Colvin, in 1920, explained that [...] "while imagery drawn from the sculptures on Greek vases was still floating through his mind, he was able to rouse himself to a stronger effort and produce a true masterpiece in his famous Ode on a Grecian Urn." [...] In his 1926 analysis, H. W. Garrod felt that the end of the poem did not match with the rest of the poem: [...] "Perhaps the fourth stanza is more beautiful than any of the others—and more true. The trouble is that it is a little too true. Truth to his main theme has taken Keats rather farther than he meant to go... This pure cold art makes, in fact, a less appeal to Keats than the Ode as a whole would pretend; and when, in the lines that follow these lines, he indulges the jarring apostrophe 'Cold Pastoral' [...] he has <b>said</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> he meant—or wished to mean." [...] In 1933, M. R. Ridley described the poem as a [...] "tense ethereal beauty" [...] with a [...] "touch of didacticism that weakens the urgency" [...] of the statements. Douglas Bush, following in 1937, emphasized the Greek aspects of the poem and stated, [...] "as in the Ode to Maia, the concrete details are suffused with a rich nostalgia. The hard edges of classical Greek writing are softened by the enveloping emotion and suggestion. In his classical moments Keats is a sculptor whose marble becomes flesh." ...|$|E
