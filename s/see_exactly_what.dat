500|$|Roger Ebert, {{writing in}} the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film four out of four stars and praised the detail in the {{portrait}} of Johnny Marco, saying [...] "Coppola is a fascinating director. She sees, and we <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> she sees. There is little attempt here to observe a plot. All the attention is on the handful of characters, on Johnny." [...] A.O. Scott in The New York Times called the film [...] "exquisite, melancholy and formally audacious" [...] and said [...] "This {{is not a matter}} of imitation, but rather of mastery, of finding — by borrowing if necessary — a visual vocabulary suited to the story and its environment. If you pay close attention, [...] "Somewhere" [...] will show you everything." [...] Peter Bradshaw disagreed in The Guardian, awarding the film two stars from five. He praised the cinematic technique but said that the film resembled Lost in Translation too closely, lacked emotional depth and that even on second viewing [...] "the question of why we should really care or be interested remains tantalisingly unanswered"; the final shot failed to solve any emotional problems and [...] "really is one of the daftest things I have seen for a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|Straw {{described}} Nick Griffin as a [...] "fantasising conspiracy theorist {{with some}} very unpleasant views and no moral compass. But {{now that he has}} been exposed for what he is it is time to move on." [...] Warsi said Griffin was [...] "...very much exposed for the man that he is. When he was questioned on his views his face of extremism was exposed. He was given an opportunity to explain some of his policies and he couldn't". Huhne said, [...] "This is a person who comes from a fascist background; anyone who watches the programme will <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he stands for." [...] Greer said Griffin had been [...] "totally trounced" [...] on the show, and that sitting next to Griffin had been [...] "probably the weirdest and most creepy experience of my life". Nevertheless, Griffin perceived that he had [...] "struck up a rapport" [...] with Greer, who treated him differently from the other panellists. Greer avoided looking in Griffin's direction throughout, and indeed turned her back on him pointedly. Speaking to the Associated Press, Griffin stated that his appearance had secured the BNP's place on the national stage, and while not revolutionary, was like gaining a kind of [...] "Boy Scout's badge". He was relatively pleased with having [...] "been able to land a few punches of my own". Later, Griffin declared: [...] "Millions of people are angry about the way I was treated." [...] Describing the experience as a [...] "lynch mob", he complained how the choice of London had made it hostile territory for him, and had prevented him from speaking on then-current events such as the postal strikes.|$|E

60|$|The arm-chair critic, {{reviewing}} {{a situation}} calmly {{and at his}} ease, is apt to make too small allowances for the effect of hurry and excitement on the human mind.

6000|$|When Laura {{wanted to}} alter her {{demeanour}} towards Guy, being perfectly cool, {{and not in}} the least conscious, she had acted with great judgment, <b>seen</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> to do, and what to leave undone, so as to keep up appearances. But it was not so with Amy. She was afraid of herself, and was in extremes. She would not come down till the last moment, that there might be no talking in the window. She hardly spoke at breakfast-time, and adhered closely to Laura and Eveleen when they wandered in the garden. Presently Charles looked out from the dressing-room window, calling,-- ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{suppose there}} is such a place," [...] Balbus said, meditatively, [...] "though I never heard of it. And the people must find it very queer, as Hugh says, to have the old day east of them, and the new one west: because, when midnight comes round to them, with the new day in front of it and the old one behind it, one doesn't <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> happens. I must think it over." ...|$|E
50|$|That night, {{the two are}} {{attacked}} by Ketch. When Blaze performs the Penance Stare on his brother, he <b>sees</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> has transpired. Ketch has murdered the hosts of numerous riders for their powers. When Blaze shows pity, Ketch is able to return the stare on Blaze. This sends Blaze into temporary insanity. Before Ketch is {{able to take the}} power of Zarathos, he is stopped by the new caretaker Sister Sara. She rescues Blaze and they escape to a safehouse. At the safehouse, during Blaze's self-pity and Sara's trying to console him, they are visited by two more Ghost Riders, the Arabic Molek and the Chinese Bai Gu Jing, who they follow to Japan.|$|R
5000|$|The Konica Domirex was a {{prototype}} camera, a 35mm SLR, using an unusual mirror arrangement {{to eliminate the}} need for the mirror to flip up out of the way prior to exposure. It's still an [...] "SLR", although it looks more like a rangefinder or viewfinder camera, b. The reason is that a [...] "single lens reflex" [...] camera, by definition, uses a mirror to reflect light that's passed through the single lens into the viewfinder. The advantage of this is that the user <b>sees</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the camera is [...] "seeing". The Domirex uses a number of small mirrors to redirect the image to the viewfinder, rather than a single large mirror along with the bulging pentaprism typical of 35mm SLR cameras.|$|R
50|$|Deputy Hugh Sawyer never fired a shot. If Sawyer {{had been}} a more {{experienced}} deputy, Lynn would have likely been killed on the spot. However, Deputy Marshal Sawyer was inexperienced, and froze when the shot was fired, watching Lynn as he fled, then going to Tilghman's aid. He also later testified {{that he could not}} <b>see</b> clearly <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> happened.|$|R
60|$|To {{make all}} this distincter I {{will show the}} planlessness of certain {{contemporary}} things, of two main sets of human interests in fact, and explain what inferences a Socialist draws in these matters. You will then <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> is meant when we deny that this present state of affairs has any constructive plan, and you will appreciate in the most generalized form {{the nature of the}} constructive plan which Socialists are making and offering the world.|$|E
60|$|And it didn't. I could <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> {{must have}} happened. Insert a liberal dose of mixed spirits in a {{normally}} abstemious man, and {{he becomes a}} force. He does not stand around, twiddling his fingers and stammering. He acts. I {{had no doubt that}} Gussie must have reached for the Bassett and clasped her to him like a stevedore handling a sack of coals. And one could readily envisage the effect of that sort of thing on a girl of romantic mind.|$|E
60|$|If you examine now any of {{the little}} books which he condemns, {{you will find a}} totally {{different}} story: no record of chasing and killing, but only of patient watching, of creeping near to wild animals and winning their confidence whenever it is possible, of following them day and night with no motive but the pure love of the thing and no object but to <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> each animal is doing and to understand, so far as a man can, the mystery of its dumb life.|$|E
5000|$|Ben Bright, now {{coaching}} in England, was coached by Sutton in the 1990s and represented New Zealand in the 2000 Olympics. He said, [...] "Because of his background in training horses and dogs {{in his early}} years {{he looks at the}} animal rather than the person when coaching a session. A person can lie to you and tell you they are feeling something they are not to get the outcome they desire. The animal can't do that, so he <b>sees</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> is going on and whether he needs to adjust the session he has planned. He also instills a belief within the athlete that they can achieve their goals ... Brett takes away the doubt and just gives them a task to focus on and that helps them keep a clear mind when competing." ...|$|R

Oh, I <b>see</b> now <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> you think of me! You were not surprised to hear me lie. To you it was something I probably did every day--every hour. That is how men think of women.

"Why I {{should have}} {{imagined}} {{that there was a}} sort of irresistible fascination in me, which was bound to make you break off your engagement and upset the whole universe simply to win the wonderful reward of marrying me, is more than I can understand.

60|$|Coming before {{many people}} of {{infinite}} diversity of mind, it cannot be doubted that Christianity must necessarily take a variety of forms, to suit different intelligences, and adapt itself to differing situations. But in all this large variety of forms of religion, ranging from mere paganism at one end, just a little unavoidably altered by the contact of Christianity, and at the other extremity a pure religion, but refined and intellectual, I do not <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> is the form of Christianity which the Church of England is to preach to the masses at home and abroad. As long as England takes the Gospel to the ignorant in such infinitely diversified forms, {{it is as if}} an incapable general were to divide his forces preparatory to an assault upon a compact and well-defended stronghold.|$|E

Why, the doctor told me this morning that your chances for getting well real soon were--let's <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he said--he said the chances were ten to one! Why, that's almost as good a chance as we have in New York when we ride on the street cars or walk past a new building.
