40|$|Total {{trade and}} foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) are important incentives to enhance the economic development. of emerging countries. This paper aims to investigate the effects of macroeconomic and country <b>specific</b> <b>indicators</b> on total trade and FDI inflows in 16 countries, in three groups of BRICS, ASEAN 5 and developed countries for the period from 1981 to 2012. The ordinary least square and cross-sectional econometric model of fixed effect panel data are applied to explore {{the extent to which}} these variables are related in individual countries and sets of countries as a panel, respectively. In addition, the outcomes of this study help policy makers in developed and developing countries to identify influential determinants of total trade and FDI in order to optimize policies to increase international trade as well as foreign investments, and benefit from higher employment rate and economic growth. The findings from ordinary least square analysis indicate that both sets of factors are significant in influencing total trade of all countries except China where macroeconomic factors are more significant in affecting total trade. Moreover, the results from the fixed effect panel analysis also denote that both macroeconomic and country <b>specific</b> <b>indicators</b> significantly influence total trade in the three groups of countries. The findings indicate that both macroeconomic factors and country <b>specific</b> <b>indicators</b> are significant in determining FDI inflows of South Africa, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Germany, Hong Kong, and Japan. However, it is also concluded that macroeconomic factors are more significant in affecting FDI inflows in Russia, China, Korea and the United States. Alternatively, country <b>specific</b> <b>indicators</b> are more significant in determining FDI inflows in Brazil. The findings from the fixed effect panel model indicate that FDI inflows in developed countries are significantly influenced by both sets of macroeconomic and country <b>specific</b> <b>indicators.</b> For the group of ASEAN 5 and BRICS countries, the set of macroeconomic factors are more significant in determining FDI inflow...|$|R
50|$|AST {{is similar}} to alanine {{transaminase}} (ALT) in that both enzymes are associated with liver parenchymal cells. The difference is that ALT is found predominantly in the liver, with clinically negligible quantities found in the kidneys, heart, and skeletal muscle, while AST {{is found in the}} liver, heart (cardiac muscle), skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, and red blood cells. As a result, ALT is a more <b>specific</b> <b>indicator</b> of liver inflammation than AST, as AST may be elevated also in diseases affecting other organs, such as myocardial infarction, acute pancreatitis, acute hemolytic anemia, severe burns, acute renal disease, musculoskeletal diseases, and trauma.|$|E

These marks were usually indicated with a chiseled arrow below the horizontal line.

5000|$|Serum iron levels (i.e. iron {{not part}} of the {{hemoglobin}} in red cells) may be measured directly in the blood, but these levels increase immediately with iron supplementation (the patient must stop supplements for 24 hours), and pure blood-serum iron concentration, in any case, is not as sensitive as a combination of total serum iron, along with a measure of the serum iron-binding protein levels (TIBC). The ratio of serum iron to TIBC (called iron saturation or transferrin saturation index or percent) is the most <b>specific</b> <b>indicator</b> of iron deficiency when it is sufficiently low. The iron saturation (or transferrin saturation) of < 5% almost always indicates iron deficiency, while levels from 5% to 10% make the diagnosis of iron deficiency possible but not definitive. A transferrin saturation of 12% or more (taken alone) makes the diagnosis unlikely. Normal saturations are usually slightly lower for women (>12%) than for men (>15%), but this may indicate simply an overall slightly poorer iron status for women in the [...] "normal" [...] population.|$|E
