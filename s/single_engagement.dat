5|$|North Korean {{forces had}} four {{possible}} routes in the perimeter: to the south, the {{pass through the}} city of Masan around {{the confluence of the}} Nam and Naktong rivers; another southerly route through the Naktong Bulge and into the railroad lines at Miryang; through the route into Taegu in the north; and through Kyongju in the eastern corridor. North Korea mounted a large offensive in August, simultaneously attacking all four entries into the perimeter. As a result, the Battle of Pusan Perimeter was not one <b>single</b> <b>engagement</b> but a series of large battles fought between the UN and North Korean divisions all along the perimeter.|$|E
5|$|On April 4, King—a {{prominent}} African-American {{civil rights}} leader—was assassinated. Race riots subsequently broke {{out across the}} United States. After delivering an improvised speech on the matter in Indianapolis, Kennedy withdrew to the hotel he was staying in and suspended his presidential campaign. Community leaders convinced him to keep a <b>single</b> <b>engagement</b> before the City Club of Cleveland. Doing away with his prepared remarks, Kennedy's speechwriters worked early into the morning of April 5 creating a full response to the assassination. Kennedy reviewed and revised the draft during his flight to Cleveland. Speaking in a tragic mode for only ten minutes before 2,200 people, Kennedy outlined his view on violence in American society. He criticized both the rioters and the white establishment who, from his perspective, {{were responsible for the}} deterioration of social conditions in the United States. He proposed no specific solutions to the internal division and conflict, but admonished the audience to seek common ground and try to cooperate with other Americans.|$|E

40|$|The {{torque output}} of a carbon/carbon multi-plate Formula One clutch during race starts {{has proved to}} be both {{unstable}} and inconsistent. A one-dimensional heat transfer model utilising a Taguchi analysis suggested that a close interdependency exists between surface temperature, surface morphology and coefficient of friction thus affecting torque output stability. Friction surface examination showed that a non-uniform friction surface height may lead to thermoelastic instabilities and effective friction radius migration which directly affects torque output. A single clutch-plate interface dynamometer confirmed the formation of narrow (~ 2 mm), high-temperature (1300 - 1650 °C) hot bands during tests replicating race start conditions, indicating the establishment of thermoelastic instabilities. The hot bands did not move radially during <b>single</b> <b>engagements</b> but did migrate between successive engagements indicating that torque instability during <b>single</b> <b>engagements</b> is due to surface morphology effects alone whilst torque inconsistency between engagements is due to both surface morphology and effective friction radius migration effects...|$|R

40|$|A single clutch-plate {{interface}} dynamometer (SCID) {{was designed}} and commissioned to facilitate friction and thermal performance testing of single clutch-plate pairs. Narrow (~ 2 mm) high-temperature (1300 - 1650 °C) hot bands were observed during SCID tests at high rotational speeds and clamp loads typical of race starts. Migration of the hot bands occurred between successive engagements but not during <b>single</b> <b>engagements.</b> Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showed that {{the thickness of the}} friction film formed on the friction surfaces appeared to become thicker as the amount of friction work increased. A thermomechanically coupled finite element analysis (TCFEA) was then developed by coupling Matlab and Abaqus to simulate the thermo-mechanical response of a single clutch-plate pair during SCID testing. With allowance for wear, the model predicts high degrees of contact localisation resulting in a single distinct hot band of comparable temperature and width to those recorded during SCID testing...|$|R

On that evening, within 45 minutes, he burned two Fokker D.VIIs and knocked another down out of control, set an Albatros D.V afire, and drove a Pfalz D.III out of the air.

25|$|The {{regiment}} gained recognition on July 18, 1863, when it spearheaded {{an assault}} on Fort Wagner near Charleston, South Carolina. Colonel Shaw was killed, along with one-hundred and sixteen of his men. Another hundred and fifty-six were wounded or captured. The total casualties of 272 would be the highest total for the 54th in a <b>single</b> <b>engagement</b> during the war. Although {{they were not able}} to capture the fort, the 54th was widely acclaimed for its valor, and the event helped encourage the further enlistment and mobilization of African-American troops, a key development that President Abraham Lincoln once noted as helping to secure the final victory.|$|E

He claimed a Spitfire on 26 August. The next day, the whole Stormo scrambled to intercept four-engine bombers, which were attacking Cerveteri, on Latium coast, in central Italy. Gorrini, still flying a Veltro, shot down two Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses and a Lockheed P-38 Lightning, in a <b>single</b> <b>engagement</b> (according to other sources, Gorrini claimed two B-24s). One wing of his C.205 was damaged after an overheating cannon muzzle exploded. After running out of gasoline, he glided back to his base for a powerless landing. On 29 August, he claimed two P-38s destroyed and two more damaged.|$|E
40|$|The {{torque output}} of a carbon/carbon multi-plate Formula One clutch during race starts {{has proved to}} be both {{unstable}} and inconsistent. A specially designed single clutch-plate interface dynamometer (SCID) showed the formation of narrow (~ 2 mm), high-temperature (1300 - 1650 °C) hot bands during tests replicating race start conditions, suggesting that less than 15 % of the full friction surface areas were in contact. A thermomechanically coupled finite element analysis (TCFEA) was developed to simulate the thermomechanical behaviour of the clutch plates during SCID testing. With allowance for wear, the TCFEA closely replicated the SCID results. Both the SCID and TCFEA demonstrated no radial movement of the hot bands during <b>single</b> <b>engagements</b> indicating that torque instability is due to surface morphology effects alone. The hot band migration observed between successive SCID engagements indicated that torque inconsistency is due to both surface morphology and hot band migration effects...|$|R
2500|$|Little {{is known}} of Priuli's early life except that {{he was born in}} Venice around 1575. Information about the first twenty-five years of his life is lacking. [...] Beginning in 1600, he was a close {{associate}} of Gabrieli, and it is presumed he may have been his student; the two were associated for the duration of Priuli's Venetian career. When Priuli is first mentioned in the records of St. Mark's, he was already an experienced musician, being hired as assistant organist to Gabrieli on several occasions between 1600 and 1605. In May 1607 he received a more permanent position as deputy organist; prior to that, the payment records indicated that his hires were for <b>single</b> <b>engagements.</b> Since St. Mark's had two regular organists, the deputy filled in for special occasions, and also when one of the two principal organists was either traveling or ill. The first organist through most of the period was Paolo Giusto, while Gabrieli was second organist.|$|R

25|$|As the Battle of the Wilderness wound down, the {{commander}} of the Army of Northern Virginia, General Robert E. Lee, anticipated Union Army General-in-Chief, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's move to the south and west. Lee sent cavalry to block the roads in the direction of Spotsylvania Court House, Virginia near Todd's Tavern, about a mile {{from the edge of the}} Wilderness battlefield. Todd's Tavern and the Brock Road, which had been abandoned on May 6, had to be retaken by Union forces on May 7. The fight at and near the tavern became the largest dismounted cavalry fight during the war. The 1st and 2nd brigades of the Army of the Potomac's 1st Cavalry Division drove the Confederate forces of Brig. Gen. John Gregg to the south across the Po River (Virginia) and the forces of Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee back to Todd's Tavern. In the afternoon, Sheridan committed the Reserve Brigade, then under Gibbs, to the battle. Gibbs ordered the 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry to probe Fitzhugh Lee's line and to dismount and the other regiments to dismount and drive the Confederates back. By dark, Lee's men had been pushed so far south that the Brock Road was open to immediate use by Grant and Meade. Gibbs's brigade lost the majority of the 154 Union casualties. Most of them were in his own regiment, which suffered more than 80 casualties, the most casualties of any mounted Union regiment in a <b>single</b> <b>engagement.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Soviet Union {{had some}} 23,000 tanks {{available}} of which only 14,700 were combat-ready. Around 11,000 tanks {{were in the}} western military districts that faced the German invasion force. Hitler later declared {{to some of his}} generals, [...] "If I had known about the Russian tank strength in 1941 I would not have attacked". However, maintenance and readiness standards were very poor; ammunition and radios were in short supply, and many armoured units lacked the trucks for supplies. The most advanced Soviet tank models – the KV-1 and T-34 – which were superior to all current German tanks, as well as all designs still in development as of the summer 1941, were not available in large numbers at the time the invasion commenced. Furthermore, in the autumn of 1939, the Soviets disbanded their mechanized corps and partly dispersed their tanks to infantry divisions; but following their observation of the German campaign in France, in late-1940 they began to reorganize most of their armored assets back into mechanized corps with a target strength of 1,031 tanks each. But these large armoured formations were unwieldy, and moreover they were spread out in scattered garrisons, with their subordinate divisions up to [...] apart. The reorganization was still in progress and incomplete when Barbarossa commenced. Soviet tank units were rarely well equipped, and they lacked training and logistical support. Units were sent into combat with no arrangements in place for refueling, ammunition resupply, or personnel replacement. Often, after a <b>single</b> <b>engagement,</b> units were destroyed or rendered ineffective. The Soviet numerical advantage in heavy equipment was thoroughly offset by the superior training and organization of the Wehrmacht.|$|E
