The strings and horns constituted the only instruments added subsequently to the initial recording sessions.|$|E

2500|$|Alcibiades, an Athenian {{general who}} had been the main proponent of the {{disastrous}} Sicilian Expedition during the Peloponnesian Wars, where virtually the entire Athenian invading force of more than 50,000 soldiers and non-combatants (e.g., the rowers of the Triremes) was killed or captured and enslaved, was a student and close friend of Socrates, and his messmate during the siege of Potidaea (433–429 BC). Socrates remained Alcibiades' close friend, admirer, and mentor for about five or six years. While a masterful orator, Alcibiades has been described by at least two 20th century psychologists as exhibiting the classic features of psychopathy. During his career, Alcibiades famously defected to Sparta, Athens' enemy, after being summoned to trial, then to Persia after being caught in an affair with the wife of his benefactor (the King of Sparta), [...] then back to Athens after successfully persuading the Athenians that Persia would come to their aid against Sparta (though Persia had no intention of doing <b>so),</b> <b>finally</b> [...] driven out of Athens after the defeat of the Battle of Notium against Sparta, before being assassinated in Phrygia in 404 BC by his Spartan enemies.|$|E
2500|$|For the album's front cover, {{the band}} {{wanted to take}} a photo with a monkey from the Bronx Zoo. George DuBose {{originally}} took the picture in the zoo's monkey house, but this photo was rejected by the zoo director. The zoo would not allow the band to borrow a chimp for photographing, so DuBose decided to try and hire Zippy the Chimp from The David Letterman Show and was successful. The resulting idea was to take the picture of the band {{standing in front of a}} gorilla cage with Legs McNeil, Joey's brother and Punk Magazine author, in a gorilla costume. Dee Dee is holding Zippy the Chimp, a baby chimpanzee, and because of this, DuBose had to refrain from flashing light as he could possibly spooked it, although according to DuBose, the chimp was already out of control. [...] "Zippy was getting wild," [...] Dubose recalled, [...] "he wasn't looking at the camera and was fucking around with the guys. I wasn't getting the picture because the chimp was out of control, <b>so</b> <b>finally</b> the trainer goes up to Zippy and whacks him across the face."

[...] They were so tame I could almost knock them over with rocks, but while the contact thus established made me increasingly anxious for grouse for dinner that night, I could not hit them. [...] <b>So</b> <b>finally,</b> in spite of those orders and with growing appetite, I shot two of them and quickly secreted the evidence of my disobedience by rolling them up in the rain coat I carried on my saddle.

2500|$|According to the Collectif Assistance Juridique (CAJ) {{independent}} group, a {{total of}} 4,500 people were arrested during the events. Among them, 1,950 were kept in garde à vue and 635 prosecution cases opened. Less than 15% of the arrested people were therefore [...] presented to the magistrates, due to insufficient evidence of alleged legal violations. The CAJ note {{that many of the}} people presented before the courts had no previous criminal record and were far from the profile of [...] "criminal rioters". They included many leaders of the movement, in particular outside Paris. A 24 March 2006 internal administrative order asked the magistrates not to be too lenient on their judgments. 42% of the persons presented before courts passed in immediate comparution, a specific (and controversial) procedure, which allow them to be judged on the spot. During the 1994 demonstrations against the CIP, a student law prepared by Balladur's government, 1000 persons only had been arrested, although the clashes had been more violent. Although Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy stated on 16 March that his [...] "priority was to arrest casseurs" [...] (rioters), the independent CAJ (Judicial Assistance Group) noted {{that the vast majority of}} arrestations hadn't been of on-the-spot witnessed violence (flagrant délit) and that many were contested. For example, on 31 March a US citizen visiting Paris was detained by the police, while on 7 April an old man getting out of a supermarket was also detained. Furthermore, many young people from the suburbs were blocked from demonstrating in Paris. According to the government, this was to impede turmoils in the capital, but critics such as the CAJ have spoken of a negation of presumption of innocence and of [...] "racial and social discrimination", since some categories of the population – mainly youth living in housing projects, those accused of having taken part in the riots in autumn 2005 – were blocked from exercising their civil rights of demonstrating against a law that affected them as well as other categories of the population. These blockings in suburbs' train stations have provoked in some cases clashes with the police, for example in Savigny-sur-Orge, in Saint-Denis or in Les Ulis... "There is no evidence which permit us to establish a parallel between the young rioters of November and the disturbing elements of this spring", notes the CAJ report, countering the Interior Minister's claims. Furthermore, police abuse was reported on a number of cases, including Cyril Ferez, a trade union member who entered coma state for several weeks following the 18 March demonstration. In Caen Charlotte entered coma for a day; Victor had two ribs broken, etc. A three-year-old child was placed 24 hours in observation after having inhalaed gas. On 16 March, the Parisian préfecture de police announced that 18 demonstrators had been injured. The IGS (internal affairs department) was charged of Cyril Ferez' case (who was in coma for several weeks) and litigation was initiated against police officers allegedly excessively brutal and violent during arrests. Additionally, cooperation between the police forces and the trade union [...] "service orders" [...] (SO, in charge of the demonstrations) was observed, including handing-over of several demonstrators to the police by the trade union's <b>SO.</b> <b>Finally,</b> the CAJ note the disproportion of sentences toward young demonstrators, while others acts of vandalism currently committed by farmers or viticulturists were more lightly punished. It thus alluded to this Alsatian mayor accused of having burned 14 travel trailers but who was condemned only to six months on parole, contrasting with the sentences given to demonstrators (for example, a high school student condemned to 41 days of jail in Fleury-Mérogis because he had burnt two garbage cans before his school).|$|E
