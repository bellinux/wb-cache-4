40|$|AbstractGypsum is {{a mineral}} dust {{consisting}} of calcium sulfate and {{is commonly used}} in building construction. We here report the first case of an acute calcium sulfate aspiration. An accidental avalanche of fine gypsum powder covered entirely a <b>silo</b> <b>worker.</b> He aspirated {{a large amount of}} gypsum powder without loosing consciousness. At admission to the emergency department the patient was breathing spontaneously and directly underwent emergency bronchoscopy. Acute tracheobronchitis was diagnosed. Remaining calcium sulfate was removed by aspiration without rinsing with additional water in order to avoid further exothermic damage to the bronchial mucosa from chemical reactions. He received steroid treatment and antibiotics, as well as bronchodilatative therapy in an attempt to increase mucociliary clearance. Within a month the patient was symptomfree without any residual radiological or functional impairment. This unusual aspiration accident is to our knowledge the first case report of an accidental calcium sulfate aspiration.

The occurrence of ILC 2 s is more frequent {{in the blood of}} subjects with allergic asthma than in healthy individuals and allergic donors. When stimulated with IL- 25 or IL- 33, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with allergic asthma produced significantly greater amounts of IL- 5 and IL- 13 than those from patients with allergic rhinitis and those from healthy donors (Bartemes et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2016). Recently, ILC 2 s were found in the bronchoalvoelar lavage (BAL) and sputum of patients with asthma, and the proportion of IL- 5 +IL- 13 + ILC 2 s in the sputum of patients with severe asthma was higher than that in corresponding samples from patients with mild asthma (Smith et al., 2016).

40|$|A Segurança Alimentar e Nutricional do trabalhador brasileiro é uma das formas de garantia de saúde e conseqüente aumento de produtividade refletido pelo compromisso do PAT Programa de Alimentação do Trabalhador que completou 30 anos em 2006. O objetivo do estudo é relacionar a variação de preços das {{commodities}} de alimentos presentes na refeição do trabalhador de acordo com o sistema normativo do PAT, identificando possíveis conseqüências negativas à Segurança Alimentar do Trabalhador no Brasil. A metodologia, por meio da análise de regressão múltipla, utiliza os dados de ICV Índice de Custo de Vida - de alimentação fora do domicílio como proxy a alimentação do trabalhador. Os resultados sugerem que os alimentos que apresentaram variação negativa com os tipos de refeições analisadas, como a carne suína e a soja, podem ser substituídos por outro valor nutricional semelhante como a carne bovina, o frango e o óleo de milho. Apenas a variação do preço do feijão foi seguida pelo aumento do preço do prato comercial, cuja alternativa é a mudança na maneira de oferecer a refeiç ão ao trabalhador, como os restaurantes por quilo. Diante do cenário exposto, há indícios de que a variação de preços dos alimentos no mercado de commodities teria pouca influência no preço final das refeições, mas a discussão em torno da futura escassez de oferta de alimentos devido ao aumento da população mundial e a mudança dos padrões alimentares com as sociedades urbanizadas insere o risco da SAN no contexto político e econômico da nutrição. (AU) The Brazilian <b>Worker</b> <b>s</b> Nutrition and Food Security {{is one in}} {{the ways}} of warranty of health and consequent productivity increase contemplated by PAT Work Food Program that completed 30 years in 2006. The objective of the study is to relate the variation of prices of the commodities of present foods in the <b>worker</b> <b>s</b> meal in agreement with PAT s normative system, identifying possible negative consequences to the <b>Worker</b> <b>s</b> Alimentary Safety in Brazil. The methodology, through the analysis of multiple regression, uses the data of ICV Cost of Living Index of feeding out of the home as proxy the <b>worker</b> <b>s</b> feeding. The foods that presented negative variation with the types of analyzed meals, as the pork and the soy, they can be substituted by others of same nutritional value, as the bovine meat, the chicken and the wheat germ oil. Just the variation of the price of the bean was followed by the increase of the price of the commercial plate, whose alternative is the change in the way of offering the meal to the worker, as the restaurants for kilo. According to the exposed scenery, there are indications that the variation of prices in the food commodities market would have little influence in the final price of the meals, but the discussion around the future shortage of offer of foods due to the increase of the world population and the change of the alimentary patters with the urbanized societies inserts the risk of the Nutrition and Food Security in the political and economical context of the nutrition.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Agriculture is {{considered}} one of the occupations most at risk of acute or chronic respiratory problems. The aim of our study was to determine from which level of exposure to organic dust the respiratory function is chronically affected in workers involved in wheat grain or straw manipulation and to test if some of these working populations can recover their respiratory function after an exposure decrease. METHOD: 87 workers exposed to wheat dust: farmers, harvesters, <b>silo</b> <b>workers</b> and livestock farmers and 62 non exposed workers, were included into a longitudinal study comprising two visits at a six months interval with lung function measurements and symptom questionnaires. Cumulative and mean exposure to wheat dust were generated from detailed work history of each worker and a task-exposure matrix based on task-specific exposure measurements. Immunoglobulins (IgG and IgE) specific of the most frequent microorganisms in wheat dust have been determined. RESULTS: FEV 1 decreased significantly with the cumulative exposure and mean exposure levels. The estimated decrease was close to 200 mL per year of high exposure, which corresponds roughly to levels of wheat dust higher than 10 mg/m(3). Peak expiratory flow and several acute symptoms correlate with recent exposure level. Recovery of the respiratory function six months after exposure to wheat dust and evolution of exposure indicators in workers blood (IgG and IgE) will be discussed. CONCLUSIONS: These results show a chronic effect of exposure to wheat dust on bronchial obstruction. Short term effects and reversibility will be assessed using the full study results...|$|R
