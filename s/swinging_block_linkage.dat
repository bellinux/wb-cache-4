The fi rst part describes typical solutions of a generator impedance protection function (21 e) and unit distance protection function (21 s). Starting characteristics of these protection functions are shown, as well as their typical operating logics and ways of calculating their settings. Then exemplary (the most common) solutions of unit under-impedance relays power <b>swing</b> <b>blocking</b> functions are described. Following this introduction, the issues of the threat of unnecessary operation of fast-tripping protection zones of 21 e and 21 s protection functions are described, which arises in the circumstances of generator asynchronous power swings occurring after elimination of long-lasting faults in the grid supplied by the power unit. The paper also shows that the available power <b>swing</b> <b>blocking</b> functions {{may not be able to}} correctly detect the described conditions, thus allowing the unnecessary operation of under-impedance relays.

40|$|Phylogenetic tree {{reconstruction}} {{for a set}} {{of species}} is an important problem for understanding the evolutionary history of the species. Existing algorithms usually represent each species as a binary string with each bit indicating whether a particular gene/protein exists in the species. Given the topology of a phylogenetic tree with each leaf representing a species (a binary string of equal length) and each internal node representing the hypothetical ancestor, the Fitch-Hartigan algorithm and the Sankoff algorithm are two polynomial-time algorithms which assign binary strings to internal nodes such that the total Hamming distance between adjacent nodes in the tree is minimized. However, these algorithms oversimplify the evolutionary process by considering only the number of protein insertions/deletions (Hamming distance) between two species and by assuming the evolutionary history of each protein is independent. Since the function of a protein may depend on the existence of other proteins, the evolutionary history of these functionally dependent proteins should be similar, i. e. functionally dependent proteins should usually be present (or absent) in a species at the same time. Thus, in addition to the Hamming distance, the protein linkage distance for some pairs/sets of proteins: whole <b>block</b> <b>linkage</b> distance, partial <b>block</b> <b>linkage</b> distance, pairwise linkage distance is introduced. It is proved that the phylogenetic tree reconstruction problem to find the binary strings for the internal nodes of a phylogenetic tree that minimizes the sum of the Hamming distance and the linkage distance is NP-hard. In this thesis, a general algorithm to solve the phylogenetic tree reconstruction with protein linkage problem which runs in O(4 ^m⋅n) time for whole/partial <b>block</b> <b>linkage</b> distance and O(4 ^m⋅⋅ (m+n)) time for pairwise linkage distance (compared to the straight-forward O(4 ^m⋅ m⋅ n) or O(4 ^m⋅ m^ 2 ⋅⋅ n) time algorithm) is introduced where n is the number of species and m is the length of the binary string (number of proteins). It is further shown, by experiments, that our algorithm using linkage information can construct more accurate trees (better matches with the trees constructed by biologists) than the algorithms using only Hamming distance. published_or_final_versionComputer ScienceMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

30|$|The {{main purpose}} of power <b>swing</b> <b>blocking</b> is to {{distinguish}} faults from power swings. However, the faults occur during a power swing should be detected and cleared promptly. This paper proposes an adaptive concentric power swing blocker (PSB) to overcome incapability of traditional concentric PSB in detecting symmetrical fault during power swing. Based on proposed method, two pairs of concentric characteristics are anticipated which {{the first one is}} placed in a stationary position (outer of zone 3) but the position of the second pair is adjustable. In order to find the position of the second pair of characteristic, Static Phasor Estimation Error (SPEE) of current signal is utilized in this paper. The proposed method detects the abrupt change in SPEE and puts the second pair of characteristic in location of impedance trajectory correspondingly. Second concentric characteristic records travelling time of impedance trajectory between outer and inner zones and compares to threshold value to detect symmetrical fault during power swing. If recorded time is lower than threshold, three-phase fault is detected during power swing. Intensive studies have been performed and the merit of the method is demonstrated by some test signals simulations.|$|R

Designed to simulate {{a high degree of}} epistasis, these deception problems imitate extremely difficult real world problems. [1]. Studies show that Bayesian optimization and explicit building block manipulation algorithms, like the fast messy genetic algorithm (fmGA), can help in solving these problems. This paper compares the results acquired from an extended multiobjective fast messy genetic algorithm (MOMGA-IIa), ordinary multiobjective fast messy genetic algorithm (MOMGA-II), multiobjective Bayesian optimization algorithm (mBOA), and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) when applied to three different deception problems. The extended MOMGA-II is enhanced with a new technique exploiting the fmGA’s basis function to improve partitioned searching in both the genotype and phenotype domain.

Two high-definition (1080 p) video cameras (60 Hz) were used to collect two-dimensional variables from two separate views. One was placed perpendicular to the plane of the net and the other was directed along the top of the net, and were used to estimate COM locations and blocking area in a plane parallel to the net and hand penetration through the plane of the net respectively. Video of both the traditional and swing techniques were digitized and kinematic variables were calculated. Paired samples t-tests indicated that the swing technique resulted in greater (p < 0. 05) vertical and horizontal takeoff velocities (vy and vx), jump height (H), duration of the block (tBLOCK), blocking coverage during the block (C) as well as hand penetration above and through the net’s plane (YPEN, ZPEN). The traditional technique had significantly greater approach time (tAPP). The results of this study suggest that the swing technique results in both greater jump height and effective blocking area.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper [Ghysels, J. Chem. Phys. 126, 224102 (2007) ] the mobile block Hessian (MBH) approach was presented. The method {{was designed to}} accurately compute vibrational modes of partially optimized molecular structures. The key concept was the introduction of several blocks of atoms, which can move as rigid bodies {{with respect to a}} local, fully optimized subsystem. The choice of the blocks was restricted in the sense that none of them could be connected, and also linear blocks were not taken into consideration. In this paper an extended version of the MBH method is presented that is generally applicable and allows blocks to be adjoined by one or two common atoms. This extension to all possible block partitions of the molecule provides a structural flexibility varying from very rigid to extremely relaxed. The general MBH method is very well suited to study selected normal modes of large macromolecules (such as proteins and polymers) because the number of degrees of freedom can be greatly reduced while still keeping the essential motions of the molecular system. The {{reduction in the number of}} degrees of freedom due to the <b>block</b> <b>linkages</b> is imposed here directly using a constraint method, in contrast to restraint methods where stiff harmonic couplings are introduced to restrain the relative motion of the blocks.

40|$|The {{synthetic}} engineering of anionic polyoxometalate (POM) clusters with predefined properties {{tailored to}} specific applications {{is a great}} challenge using routine “one-pot ” POM syntheses. Under such conditions, difficulties often arise from the multitude of complex reaction pathways and self-assembly processes occurring in solution. In this respect the major role of the charge balancing cations cannot be ignored, in fact such cations are crucial, both in the assembly of the building <b>blocks,</b> <b>linkage</b> to the overall cluster, and then assembly into the bulk material. Further, {{the role of the}} cation facilitating the selective crystallization of a particular cluster type cannot be divorced from the reaction process since the crystallization process itself can help pull “virtual ” building blocks into being. This perspective briefly outlines our efforts towards engineering novel POM based materials, highlighting the use of large organic cations as “Shrink-wrapping ” agents to isolate new POM clusters, frameworks and cage compounds. Central to this perspective is the hypothesis that, in the case of POM cluster assembly, the mechanism and various equilibria which define the clusters can be controlled by the selective crystallisation using cation control. Consequently, this indicates that the process of crystallisation can {{have a profound effect on}} self-assembly at the molecular level. We therefore propose that the crystallization process itself may define the molecular structure of the cluster leading to the conundrum, which came first, the cluster or the crystal of the cluster? 1...|$|R

WAMS and WAPS incorporated in backup protection systems were named as a wide-area backup protection (WABP) system [18 – 23]. P.K. Nayak et.al, in their research work [18] have developed a WABP system based on sequence components of the bus voltages. With this proposed system, the authors could identify the bus nearer to the fault and faulty line. Based on these data, the relays to be operated are recognized. Hinge et.al [19] have developed WABP, which works based on segregated phase comparison technique. However, the methodologies proposed in [18, 19] may require recalibration of existing relays in terms of pickup criterion sensitivity. Hall et.al [20] have proposed a wide-area distributed current differential scheme for WABP of the transmission line. However, {{the accuracy of the}} proposed scheme is affected by the power system unbalances. Though, the differential protection is simple in principle, but not so easy for implementation because it depends on data synchronization {{on both sides of the}} line to be protected. Li et.al in their research work [21] have evaluated the performance of WABP under various power system disturbances.

The {{main purpose}} of the power-swing blocking function is to differentiate faults from power <b>swings</b> and <b>block</b> distance or other relay elements from operating during stable or unstable power <b>swings.</b> Most power-swing <b>blocking</b> elements are based on traditional methods that monitor {{the rate of change}} of the positivesequence impedance. The required settings for the power-swing blocking elements could be difficult to calculate in many applications, particularly those where fast swings can be expected. For these cases, extensive stability studies are necessary to determine the fastest rate of possible power swings. This paper describes a zero-setting power-swing blocking protection method that is independent of network parameters and is based on monitoring the line swing-center voltage rate of change. The new method does not require any stability studies or user settings for the proper blocking of relay elements that are prone to operate during stable or unstable power swings. The method is applicable to long, heavily loaded transmission lines that pose great problems in the application of power-swing blocking elements based on traditional methods. This new method offers a great advantage in its ability to detect three-phase faults that may occur during power swings and allows the protective relays to issue a tripping command and isolate the faulted power system element. In this paper, we discuss other enhancements in the design of power-swing blocking and out-of-step tripping functions that improve the security and reliability of the power system. We also demonstrate the behavior and performance of the new power-swing blocking element through use of electromagnetic transient program (EMTP) and relay simulations...|$|R
