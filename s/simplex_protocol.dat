50|$|NCP {{preceded the}} Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as a {{transport}} layer protocol {{used during the}} early ARPANET. NCP was a <b>simplex</b> <b>protocol</b> that utilized two port addresses, establishing two connections, for two-way communications. An odd and an even port were reserved for each application layer application or protocol. The standardization of TCP and UDP reduced {{the need for the}} use of two simplex ports for each application down to one duplex port.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the {{relation}} between Spiking Neural P (SN P) systems and Petri nets by focusing on modeling <b>simplex</b> stop-and-wait <b>protocol.</b> The SN P system for the protocol is constructed and also translated it into equivalent Petri net with a corresponding semantics. It is then observed a direct correspondence between the Petri net representation of the proposed model and standard solution based on Petri nets already present in the literature...|$|R
50|$|NMEA 2000 (IEC 61162-3) can be {{considered}} a successor to the NMEA 0183 (IEC 61162-1) serial data bus standard. It has a significantly higher data rate (250k bits/second vs. 4800 bits/second for NMEA 0183). It uses a compact binary message format as opposed to the ASCII serial communications protocol used by NMEA 0183. Another improvement is that NMEA 2000 supports a disciplined multiple-talker, multiple-listener data network whereas NMEA 0183 requires a single-talker, multiple-listener (<b>simplex)</b> serial communications <b>protocol.</b>|$|R
40|$|A novel {{panel of}} 16 {{microsatellite}} markers, obtained by pyrosequencing of enriched genomic libraries, is {{reported for the}} fl ightless European bushcricket Ephippiger diurnus (Dufour) (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae). Five multiplex and one <b>simplex</b> PCR <b>protocols</b> were optimized, and the polymorphism at the 16 loci was assessed in two natural populations from southern France. The mean allele number and (expected mean heterozygosity) were 8. 94 (0. 71) and 6. 57 (0. 70), respectively, in each population. Several loci were at Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium (HWD), possibly due to the incidence of null alleles. The occurrence of null alleles has been previously reported for this species, {{and it is a}} common feature of microsatellite loci in Orthoptera. Cross-amplifi cation tests demonstrated the transferability of some of these loci to other ephippigerine species. The microsatellite loci reported here substantially increase the number of available loci for this species and will afford an accurate picture of E. diurnus phylogeography, the genetic structure of its populations, and an improved understanding of the evolution of male song and other sexually-selected traits in this highly variable specie...|$|R
40|$|We {{begin by}} {{summarizing}} the services {{to be provided}} by the protocol and then describe the overall ideas of how thesearetobeprovided. E cient transfer of datagrams over ATM network. The purpose of the protocol is to transfer datagrams over ATM networks. <b>Simplex</b> communication. The <b>protocol</b> is only to provide the user with functionality for one way transfer of messages. If two way communication is needed, the user needs to establish a second connection in the opposite direction. Reliable communication. The service provided by the protocol is to be reliable. When a message is transferred and handed to the receiver, the protocol is to guarantee {{the integrity of the}} transferred data. Flow and congestion control. To adapt to the physical characteristics on which the protocol is to be used, the protocol is to include ow and congestion control. Minimal copying. To support e minimized. cient transfer of data the copying of data is to b...|$|R
40|$|Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) {{disease is}} the 'common' {{name for a}} range of {{hereditary}} peripheral neuropathies. CMT 1 is the most common form and is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner. CMT 1 A maps to chromosome 17 p 11. 2 and is caused, in the majority of cases, by a 1. 5 Mb DNA duplication, that includes the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP) gene. This paper reports on preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for CMT 1 A in five couples. The CMT 1 A duplication was detected by fluorescent PCR analysis using polymorphic (CA) n markers localized within the duplication. Single-cell PCR on blastomeres allowed genetic analysis of embryos obtained after ICSI. Only healthy unaffected embryos were transferred to the uterus. PCR experiments with single EBV-transformed lymphoblasts or with research blastomeres allowed the evaluation of amplification efficiencies, as well as contamination and allele drop-out (ADO) rates for each PCR <b>protocol.</b> Three <b>simplex</b> PCR <b>protocols</b> (using one primer pair) and two duplex PCR protocols (using two primer pairs) were developed for CMT 1 A. Additionally, a protocol using all three primer pairs in triplex was also established. Thirteen clinical ICSI-PGD cycles were performed for five couples (12 simplex PCR cycles and one duplex PCR cycle), resulting in seven embryo transfers. Three singleton pregnancies ensued in two couples and three healthy babies were delivered. This report describes different fluorescent PCR-based tests which allow efficient and accurate single-cell level detection of the CMT 1 A duplication. On the basis of the presence of the healthy allele of the affected parent-to-be (and/or absence of the affected one), healthy embryos can be selected for transfer. The assays are suitable for PGD for other couples who present with the same CMT 1 A duplication [depending on their informativity for the (CA) n markers available] as described here.
