5000|$|Roth {{sided with}} black {{students}} that opposed building the Columbia University gym in Harlem [...] in 1968, which {{was intended to}} grant African Americans limited access to facilities and was clearly an act of segregation. Roth also opposed the University's contribution to the Department of Defense {{in the form of}} research and military recruiting. These oppositions resulted in a series of direct actions, including strikes and building takeovers. He led building occupations at Columbia University. SDS leader Robert Roth was the contact for the Low library occupation where he noted the [...] "great communal feeling" [...] of those occupying the library during the take-over. The 1968 Summer session started with protests led by Roth, then a sophomore, Paul Rockwell and Stuart Gedal. On 116th and Broadway, at the university's gates, Roth led [...] "liberation classes" [...] in which he taught passing students about pressing matters. In September 1968 Robert Roth held a meeting along with other students Josephine Duke, Stuart Gedal and Mike Golash to demand that the Morningside Gym construction stop. Roth demanded Dr Andrew W. Cordier, Columbia's acting President, to end racist and militaristic actions at the university. Roth was part of a group who participated in attempting to force administrators of Columbia University to allow SDS members expelled from school to register for the following term. As a member of the SDS steering committee, Roth chastised Dr. Cordiers for refusing to lift the 42 suspensions for the expelled students, as he claimed it signified [...] "an attempt to split our movement." [...] During his time with the steering committee, Roth, along with 200 other SDS members, participated in the capture of Philosophy Hall at Columbia University on April 17, 1969. On April 17, 1969 and May 1, 1969 Roth participated in taking over and barricading the halls. Roth asserted, [...] "We are showing that University that every time it helps the war in Vietnam we will exact reprisals." [...] This quotation was in response to news that the university was accepting NASA research grants by allowing military recruitment on campus. A later FBI <b>surveillance</b> <b>file</b> from COINTELPRO confirmed Robert Roth was a participant in the Columbia student strike. He was also identified as a member of SDS and a negotiator for the Low library strikers.|$|E
40|$|Incidence {{data for}} the {{acquired}} immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are presented {{on the basis of}} a <b>surveillance</b> <b>file</b> maintained by the San Francisco Bureau of Communicable Disease Control. The incidence of AIDS among residents of San Francisco rose steadily from the first case diagnosed in the last quarter of 1980 through the last quarter of 1983. New cases were diagnosed at a rate of 25 per month in the last quarter of 1983. Reported incidence declined in mid- 1983, but the decline was probably a case-finding artifact. Smoothed incidence rates show a steady progressive rise, which is approximated equally well by quadratic or exponential curves. Among the patients diagnosed in San Francisco, 990 / 0 were homosexual or bisexual men. The cumulative incidence rate among homosex-ual or bisexual men was estimated to be 770 per 100, 000 in the last quarter of 1983. The incidence rate of AIDS increased with age, and the increase was greater than that found with other sexually transmitted diseases. The difference in the age distributions between cases of AIDS and syphilis suggests either that susceptibility to AIDS increases with age or that the average latency associated with AIDS is longer than previously thought.

40|$|IntroductionInjuries, {{including}} those resulting from violence, are a {{leading cause of}} death during pregnancy and the postpartum period. North Carolina, along with other states, has implemented surveillance systems to improve reporting of maternal deaths, but their ability to capture violent deaths is unknown. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify the improvement in ascertainment of pregnancy-associated suicides and homicides by linking data from the North Carolina Violent Death Reporting System (NC-VDRS) to traditional maternal mortality <b>surveillance</b> <b>files.</b> MethodsEnhanced case ascertainment was used to identify suicides and homicides that occurred during or up to 1 year after pregnancy from 2005 to 2011 in North Carolina. NC-VDRS data were linked to traditional maternal mortality <b>surveillance</b> <b>files</b> (i. e., death certificates with any mention of pregnancy or matched to a live birth or fetal death record and hospital discharge records for women who died in the hospital with a pregnancy-related diagnosis). Mortality ratios were calculated by case ascertainment method. Analyses were conducted in 2015. ResultsA total of 29 suicides and 55 homicides were identified among pregnant and postpartum women through enhanced case ascertainment as compared with 20 and 34, respectively, from traditional case ascertainment. Linkage to NC-VDRS captured 55. 6 % more pregnancy-associated violent deaths than traditional surveillance alone, resulting in higher mortality ratios for suicide (2. 3 vs 3. 3 deaths per 100, 000 live births) and homicide (3. 9 vs 6. 2 deaths per 100, 000 live births).

Nevertheless, far away from any international safety level, the Russiandesigned Greifswald Atomic Power Plant became the most dangerous undertaking to date for the environment of the entire Northern Germany and Baltic Sea region. As the cornerst{{one of the}} former East Germany’s atomic energy plan, the planned reactors were to be the complete solution to any and all energy crises that might hit the weakened state’s economy during the 1980 s. Despite the billions invested, no reactor was started up after 1979, thereby showing the East German leadership to be in need of reform. Since 1990, increased attention has focussed on the prominent role played in the decline of socialist East Germany by the facts of Stasi’s suppression, the absence of freedom of speech and domicile, and the enormous pollution of the environment. This is due to the progress achieved in the analysis of Stasi’s files, beginning with the termed Opferakten (<b>surveillance</b> <b>files</b> made by Stasi department XX). All these reasons, leading to the collapse of the G. D. R., originated with the permanent energy crisis, which in turn resulted from the collapse of the atomic energy plan.

40|$|From the 1880 s {{through the}} 1940 s tens of {{thousands}} of anarchists were active in the United States, the overwhelming majority of them first- and second-generation immigrants. But most were not yet devotees of the anarchist cause when they arrived on American shores. Instead, a clear link existed between migration and the embrace of anarchist ideology. This study asks how and whythousands of migrants became anarchists, and how their embrace of an anti-nationalist and cosmopolitan ideology shaped their identities, experiences and actions. Utilizing anarchist publications, government <b>surveillance</b> <b>files,</b> and archival materials, it focuses on Eastern European Jews and Italians—the two largest segments of the anarchist movement {{by the turn of the}} century—and the development of anarchism among these groups in three important centers of American anarchism: New York's Lower East Side, Paterson, New Jersey, and San Francisco. It then follows the changing fortunes of the movement in the face of war, the Russian Revolution, the First Red Scare, and the birth of communism and fascism, and ends with an examination of immigrant American anarchist participation in the Spanish Civil War of 1936 - 39, and that conflict's dramatic impact on the movement in the United States. This study argues that it was American conditions that usually made immigrants into anarchists, rather than European ones, inextricably linking the histories of migration and American anarchism. Nevertheless, the phenomenon of post-migration radicalization defies categorization within most historiographical paradigms of European immigration that focus on the construction of "hyphenated" American identities or "hybrid" transnational ones. Anarchists chose an alternative: they embraced an ideology that opposed both Americanization and Old World nationalisms, severing their attachments to their states of origin while willfully resisting assimilation into their host society. They formulated a radical cosmopolitan outlook and identity that embraced diversity, rejected hierarchies, and extended solidarity across national, ethnic, and racial divides. This cosmopolitanism was ultimately unable to withstand the onslaught of competing nationalisms ranging from Americanism to fascism to Zionism, but it stands as an important example of a transnational collective identity delinked from nationalism, the nation-state and racial hierarchies...|$|R

40|$|The US Black Panther Party for Self-Defense was an {{organization}} of the Black Power Movement, a cultural and a political nationalist movement central {{to the history of}} the African-American Freedom Struggle. The Black Panthers' anti-imperialist politics, militant visual style, grassroots strategies, and community programs appealed within and beyond the United States. Between 1967 and 1972, people of color struggling under class and ethnic oppression in six countries outside the United States formed Black Panther Parties inspired by the US Panthers. In the United Kingdom, West Indians, West Africans, and South Asians formed a Black Panther Movement in 1968 and in Israel, a group of Mizrahi (Arab) Jews founded a Black Panther Party in in Jerusalem in 1971. This dissertation examines these two movements with reference to the US Black Panthers in order to place local, national, and global histories in dialogue. This study adopts a transnational framework that conceives of Black Power as a movement of global migrants. From 1948 to 1967, over two million people from Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean migrated to the UK and Israel. These migrants' overlapping experiences of displacement and class- and ethnic-based oppression led them to establish Black Panther groups in their new home countries in order to raise their political concerns under a collective banner. These people chose to become Black Panthers specifically because the US Black Panther Party offered a name and style that connected their global brothers and sisters to a range of grassroots strategies promoting interethnic solidarity and the collective advancement of black communities against the social structures that fostered racism. Through the examination of oral histories, photographs, letters, fliers, passport stamps, films, court cases, and <b>surveillance</b> <b>files,</b> this study focuses on how these global Panther activists represented themselves and their politics in the public sphere. Both the British and Israeli Panther movements first organized in response to the city police's harassment of youth in their neighborhoods. Their respective critiques expanded from an opposition to police brutality to systemic goals of improving housing, education, welfare, and employment for blacks. Both of the nation-states in which these groups emerged relied upon the US for military stability and economic support during this period, such that the British and Israeli Panthers saw confrontations with their respective governments as acts of resistance to American Empire. This dissertation, then, is at once a community study of two branches of a transnational social movement as well as a larger story. The broader narrative reveals how everyday people responded to the American Empire in the 1960 s and 1970 s, how the US Black Panthers translated black internationalist politics into urban neighborhoods, and how people outside the US constructed narratives about African-Americans as a way of making sense of racial formations at home. This work also demonstrates how foreign governments and media producers appropriated African-American history for a variety of in political purposes during this period. This examination enables {{a deeper understanding of the}} transnational black freedom struggle, as it centers the role that people of color outside the United States played in creating and sustaining Black Panther Movements that confronted American and British Empires from the grassroots.

The Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) control programme reported 2451 parasitologically confirmed new cases between 1996 and 2000, in the entire region of Kinshasa. Affected people (66 %) were aged 15 - 49 years. Cases occurred in every health district, and 956 (39 %) occurred in urban residents. Glossina captures in 1999 established the presence of Trypanosoma spp. Local HAT transmission is plausible but not proven. The high number of urban cases necessitates development of control strategies adapted to cities...|$|R
