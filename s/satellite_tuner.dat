The data received is stored on some sort of computing device, which then can be accessed when a Wi-Fi dongle is connected to the hotspot. Currently, this method only works with specific components when dealing with the USB <b>satellite</b> <b>tuner</b> and USB Wi-Fi dongles.|$|E
5000|$|WebTV {{produced}} reference {{designs of}} models incorporating a disk-based personal video recorder and a <b>satellite</b> <b>tuner</b> for EchoStar's Dish Network (called [...] "Dishplayer") and for DirecTV (called [...] "UltimateTV"). In 2001, EchoStar sued Microsoft {{for failing to}} support the WebTV Dishplayer. [...] EchoStar subsequently sought to acquire DirecTV and was the presumptive acquirer, but EchoStar was ultimately blocked by the Federal Communications Commission. While EchoStar's lawsuit against Microsoft was in process, DirecTV (presumptively acquired by EchoStar, and in control by EchoStar) dropped UltimateTV (thus ending Microsoft's satellite product initiatives) and picked TiVo's DirecTV product as its only Digital Video Recorder offering.|$|E

500|$|The EyeTV Netstream 4Sat {{has four}} <b>satellite</b> <b>tuners,</b> {{allowing}} four channels {{to be watched}} simultaneously from different devices. It was introduced in 2014. A review in Macworld gave it 5 out of 5 stars. The review said Elgato had addressed some {{of the limitations of}} prior EyeTV <b>satellite</b> <b>tuners</b> like Netstream Sat/DTT. Pocket-Lint gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars CNET gave it five stars. The EyeTV Sat product, which receives free-to-air television, was introduced in Europe in late 2009.

50|$|The Astro MAX {{system was}} similar to TiVo. It was {{equipped}} with twin digital <b>satellite</b> <b>tuners</b> which allowed the recording of one programme while viewing another. However, the system was {{not be able to}} allow recording of two channels and programmes at the same time.|$|R
50|$|Studio A was rebuilt in 1989, {{with the}} arrival of the first Alice Series A desk. By 1991 the first <b>satellite</b> <b>tuner</b> had arrived, which gave a much cleaner IRN feed and {{occasional}} news stories from MTV. In 1993 this also provided a sustaining service, in the form of first QEFM, then MTV's soundtrack overnight. Virgin Radio was taken as a sustainer in 1992, and then Capital Radio from 1993 to 1997. Ironically when QEFM (Quality Europe FM Radio, based in Camberley) closed in 1994 the cartridge jingle machines were purchased and used for nearly a decade at UKC Radio - nearly five times as long as QEFM lasted.|$|E
50|$|UltimateTV was a DirecTV receiver, with {{integrated}} {{digital video}} recorder (DVR) and Internet access capabilities. It was Microsoft's second product to integrate a built-in <b>satellite</b> <b>tuner</b> with a DVR and Internet access in a set-top box. It was released on October 26, 2000. The software to decode and view digital video programming was derived from WebTV (later called MSN TV). UltimateTV had support for picture-in-picture and could record up to 35 hours of video content. The Internet capabilities were provided by Microsoft TV platform software, which {{was used for the}} TV guide. The TV guide could display programming schedule for 14 days, and recording could be scheduled for any of the shows. It could also be used to access E-mail. However, Microsoft lost distribution when DirecTV accepted an acquisition bid by Echostar, who had their own DVR. By 2003, it was taken off the market, even though it is still supported by DirecTV and the acquisition by Echostar failed.|$|E
5000|$|On 17 June 2015, Romania {{turned off}} analog {{broadcasting}}, and started broadcasting with DVB-T2 technology, but with very low coverage, {{and a very}} reduced number of broadcasts available. Because of low coverage, Romania will still broadcast TVR1 in analog format on VHF until 31 December 2015. DVB-T continues to be available for an undetermined period of time, only in Sibiu ( [...] Ch 47 and Ch 54) and Bucharest ( [...] Ch 54 and Ch 59). However, since the analogue turn-off, many people who were receiving TV on terrestrial shifted to a cable or DTH operator [...] To the present day, DVB-T and DVB-T2 are still in experimental broadcast. The delay of DVB-T launching is criticized by some people in Romania, {{as a form of}} sustaining the interest of cable and DTH providers, by delaying the stable launch of DVB-T and decreasing the number of channels ( [...] once, there were available 18 channels in DVB-T, even 3 in HD) but to the present day the number has fallen to only 6, and continues to be lower, especially since TVR announced that they will reduce the number of channels (TVR news will be shut down, probably because of low audience, the same for TVR 3, and the fate of TVR HD, {{which is one of the}} channels with the highes audience in TVR Group after TVR1, is unknown). Kanal D left terrestrial platform on 2 July 2015, and, Antena 3 is the only channel except TVR's available on terrestrial in DVB-T. It is unknown whether Antena 3 will remain available on DVB-T, will shift to DVB-T2, or fully leave the terrestrial platform [...] Antena Group channels were once available both analogue and digital in terrestrial. Also, many people in Romania are somehow surprised by the fact that Romania had regressed in terrestrial broadcasts, because in analogue there were, once, about 8 channels ( [...] in Bucharest), and decreasing to only 6 channels in Digital terrestrial is a regress. However, terrestrial TV was heavily surpassed both by DTH, or Cable, some people are even watching foreign FTA on satellite, because foreign broadcasts are having a more interesting content than Romanian channels. To the present day, DVB-T and T2 are still in tests. Although many TV sellers are marking DVB-T2 capable sets as being compatible with digital terrestrial television in Romania, by highlighting this feature with a sticker on the TV, buyers are mainly interested if the TV has digital cable tunner or digital <b>satellite</b> <b>tuner,</b> however TV sets without DVB-T2 continue to be sold with only DVB-T/C and sometimes S2, as cable and satellite compatibility presents most of interest.|$|E
50|$|Later, NHK started {{regular service}} (NTSC) and {{experimental}} HDTV broadcasting using BS-2b in June 1989.

50|$|The medium-scale Broadcasting Satellite for Experimental Purposes (BSE) {{was planned}} by Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MOPT) and {{developed}} by the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) since 1974. After that, the first Japanese experimental broadcasting satellite, called BSE or Yuri, was launched in 1978. NHK started experimental broadcasting of TV program using BS-2a satellite on May, 1984. The satellite BS-2a was launched {{in preparation for the}} start of full scale 2-channel broadcasts. Broadcasting Satellite BS-2a was the first national DBS (direct broadcasting satellite), transmitting signals directly into the home of TV viewers. Attitude control of the satellite was conducted using the 3 axial method (zero momentum), and design life was 5 years. The TV transponder units are designed to sufficiently amplify transmitted signals to enable reception by small, 40 or 60 cm home-use parabolic antennas. The satellite was equipped with 3 TV transponders (including reserve units). However, one transponder malfunctioned 2 months after launch (March 23, 1984) and a second transponder malfunctioned 3 months after launch (May 3, 1984). So, the scheduled satellite broadcasting had to be hastily adjusted to test broadcasting on a single channel.Later, NHK started regular service (NTSC) and experimental HDTV broadcasting using BS-2b on June, 1989. Some Japanese producers of home electronic consumer devices began to deliver TVsets, VCRs and even home acoustic systems equipped by built-in <b>satellite</b> <b>tuners</b> or receivers. Such electronic goods had a specific BS logo. On April, 1991, Japanese company JSB started pay TV service while BS-3 communication satellite was in use. In 1996 total number of households that receive satellite broadcasting exceeded 10 million. The modern two satellite systems in use in Japan are BSAT and JCSAT; the modern WOWOW Broadcasting Satellite digital service uses BSAT satellites, while other system of digital TV broadcasting SKY PerfecTV! uses JCSAT satellites.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recently, RF {{systems have}} rapidly grown with the {{extension}} of the mobile communication service. The mobile service companies are providing the satellite broadcasting and common usage are expected. Coinciding with current trend, the development of improved satellite DMB (Digital Multimedia Broadcasting) tuner is required. To improve the receiving sensitivity under the poor communication circumstance, it is necessary to design the LNA (Low Noise Amplifier) with outstanding low noise characteristic and the BPF (Bandpass Filter) to transmit only desired signal without distortion and loss. Besides high reliability, the miniaturization and lightweight are required for design of mobile terminals. In this paper, we designed and fabricated DMB nonuniform SIR-type BPF with embedded tunable pads, which operates at 2642 ㎒ and is embedded in the substrate of RF module of a tuner with LTCC. As a result, we obtained the passband insertion loss of 2. 4 dB and the passband ripple of 0. 08 dB. So this BPF is applicable to RF module of a <b>satellite</b> DMB <b>tuner...</b>|$|R
