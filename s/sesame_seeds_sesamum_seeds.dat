This study was carried out to adopt nanoemulsion as a means of entrapping Ciprofloxacin in the oil phase of the emulsion for transdermal drug delivery. Nanoemulsions were formulated as oil in water (O/W) type and prepared by self-mild mechanical nanoemulsification method. The formulation consisted of Sandbox (Hura crepitan) and <b>Sesame</b> <b>seed</b> (<b>Sesamum</b> indicum) as the organic phase of the emulsion, Polyethylene (20) sorbitanmonooleate (Tween 80) and Polyethylene (20) sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20) as the surfactants and Polyehtylene glycol (PEG 400) as co-surfactant. The formulations were tested and characterized. Ciprofloxacin (0. 075 g) was incorporated into the oil phase of the most stable nanoemulsion formulation prior emulsification and tested on Escherichia Coli. Transdermal application was done on white albino rats (R). The result showed the zones of inhibition of HCa 3 +Ciprofloxacin and SSA 3 +Ciprofloxacinn to be 26. 00 and 25. 00 mm respectively. The HPLC results showed, out of 75000 Î¼g of Ciprofloxacin loaded in the oil phases of HCa 3 and SSA 3 formulations, 6. 0076 (R 2), 0. 4112 (R 3) and 6. 7241 Î¼g (R 6) were absorbed in HCa 3 while 1. 9519 (R 1), 1. 2631 (R 4) and 2. 1801 Î¼g (R 5) were absorbed in SSA 3.

The transport from apical to basolateral side in cell monolayers was evaluated by RP-HPLC-UV and indirect competitive ELISA methods, being confirmed by western-blotting analysis. Significant amounts (â¼ 15 - 25 nmol Î¼mol- 1 initial amount/h) of intact Ber e 1 and Ses i 1 {{were found in the}} basolateral side. The absorption rates of both plant allergens through the cell monolayer were shown to be constant during the whole incubation period (4 h at 37 Â°C), verifying that the permeability of the membrane was not altered by the allergen digests.

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} the isolated compounds and asses the phytochemical {{properties of the}} possible functional molecules for therapeutic uses by screening the ethyl acetate and acetone fractions of water extract derived from <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> (<b>Sesamum</b> indicum) in vitro. Methods: Fractions of ethyl acetate and acetone were extracted from the aqueous extract of S. indicum seed by liquid-liquid solvent extraction method and was screened for possible phytochemical, antibacterial and biomedical activities using specific standard in vitro methods. Results: The ethyl acetate and acetone fractions were subjected to various identification tests to {{identify the}} presence of possible flavonoid compound. The ethyl acetate fraction showed characteristic bands of flavonoids in the thin layer chromatography and ultra-violet spectroscopy. The ethyl acetate fraction was also potent antioxidant as it scavenged DPPH radical up to 70 % at the concentration of 100 Âµg/ml whereas the acetone fraction exhibited less activity. The ethyl acetate fraction showed moderate to good antimicrobial activities. In minimum bactericidal concentration test it exhibited better results in case of S. aureus than E. coli. The acetone fraction showed mild antimicrobial effect against some strains of microbes. The lethality index of the two fractions in brine shrimp indicated possible anticancer properties. The ethyl acetate fraction also showed s tronger hemagglutination inhibition activity than the acetone fraction. Conclusion: The low activity of acetone fraction {{can be explained by}} the extraction procedure inefficiency. Since acetone is much soluble in water than ethyl acetate there was difficulty in separating the two layers that may had caused inadequate amount of polyphenols isolated by the procedure.

Gomashio is often homemade, though it is also commercially available in glass or plastic containers.|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: In {{previous}} study sesame milk was developed. The developed milk had slightly acceptable dispersion stability and taste {{and there were}} a need to improve it. Approach: Dispersion stability and taste were improved by investigating the interaction effects of <b>sesame</b> <b>seed</b> to water ratios (10 or 12 or 14 % <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds)</b> and different pasteurization treatments (65 Â°C- 30 min or 75 Â°C- 5 min or 85 Â°C- 5 min). Results: The best <b>sesame</b> <b>seed</b> concentration was 12 % and the best heat treatment was 85 Â°C - 5 min. Conclusion/Recommendation: <b>Sesame</b> <b>seed</b> concentration and heat treatment of sesame milk had significant effect on sesame milk dispersion stability and sensory properties...|$|R
