40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that this model reproduces {{a variety of}} electrophysiological findings on the visual properties of action-selective neurons in the superior temporal sulcus, and of mirror neurons in area F 5. Specifically, the model accounts {{for the fact that}} a majority of mirror neurons in area F 5 <b>show</b> <b>view</b> dependence. The model predicts a number of electrophysiological results, which partially could be confirmed in recent experiments. |$|E
40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{construct}} a theoretical model including antecedents of the adoption and execution of supply chain management (SCM) discussed in literature, provide a combination of measurement scales to develop constructs in the current model, practically confirm a hierarchical sequence of drivers that have strong impact on the adoption and execution of SCM, and support top management through focus on SCM adopting and executing drivers. Methodology- The model is tested on top 200 Pakistan, Punjab textile companies were selected out of which 64 companies through random sampling was selected and their mangers were interviewed via a self-administered questionnaire. Findings-using theoretical framework we conclude that SCM internal conditions bring about the SCM external conditions. These conditions effect the adoption of SCM-related processes. Both conditions and SCM-related processes collaboratively help the firms for the complete execution of SCM. Research implications/limitations –The results of survey <b>show</b> <b>view</b> of large level organizations in Pakistan, Punjab in supply chain context. Practical implications – The survey findings emphasize on management, personnel and financial initiatives to improve the integration and competitiveness of supply chain...|$|E
