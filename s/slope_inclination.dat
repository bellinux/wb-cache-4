The length of the runway is 750 meter with width of 23 meter. A stopway of 30 meter is provided for runway 02. The runway surface is asphalt and its strength can accommodate up to CASA 212 aircraft.

Works of excavation, grading and replacement with appropriate fill began in 1992. [...] "Over 765,000 m3 was taken out of the Park and 160,000 m3 was used as fill elsewhere on site. A further 605,000 m3 was subjected to geotechnical treatment (sieving, washing, etc.) and mixed with 60,000 m3 of special sand and topsoil to enable the site to be covered with a layer of “good” soil from 0.5 to 2.0 meters deep. A total of 1.5 million cubic meters of rubble and soil were moved, which represents over 80,000 truckloads."

Five novice and six intermediate female climbers completed a climbing route at three slope inclinations (85 °, 90 °, and 98 °). The vertical loading during the climb was assessed by force-time integral using a Novel Pedar-X insole and physiological responses via oxygen uptake and heart rate.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is on one hand to enhance the current {{predictive}} capabilities of the stability of soil slopes {{and on the other}} hand, to improve the design practice to stabilise natural slopes showing signs of distress and make the design of engineered slopes more affordable. To achieve the first objective an analytical method achieved by the upper bound theorem of limit analysis and the pseudo-static approach is derived for the assessment of the stability of slopes manifesting vertical cracks and subject to seismic action. The method is validated by numerical limit analyses and displacement-based finite-element analyses with strength reduction technique. Employing this method slope stability charts to assess the stability factor for fissured slopes subject to both horizontal and vertical accelerations for any combination of c, φ, and <b>slope</b> <b>inclination</b> are produced. To achieve the second objective limit analysis was employed to derive a semi-analytical method to extend the applicability of current method to design the slope reinforcement for frictional backfills to cohesive frictional backfills. Design charts providing the amount of reinforcement needed as a function of cohesion, tensile strength, angle of shearing resistance and <b>slope</b> <b>inclination</b> are obtained. From the results, it emerges that accounting for the presence of cohesion allows significant savings to be made, and that cracks are often significantly detrimental to slope stability so they cannot be overlooked in the design calculations of the reinforcement. Also, a new numerical method to determine multi-linear profiles of optimal shapes for reinforced slopes in frictional backfills is presented. The method is based on the limit analysis upper bound method together with genetic algorithms and provides an optimal profile for a prescribed average <b>slope</b> <b>inclination,</b> backfill strength properties and desired number of layers to be used.

This paper focuses on the transient time-varying mean force exerted by the granular stream on the obstacle at various slope inclinations.

The appearance of forms {{is the result of}} the interdependent geological, geomorphologic, climatic, vegetational and pedological characteristics of the area. The structural and lithological properties of the rock complex, and the inclination of the slope, play a significant role in periglacial relief modelling. Climatic elements are also important, as they influence the intensity and duration of the processes. Low temperatures and relatively high precipitation during the last ice age (Würm III), served to intensify the activity of periglacial processes and relief modelling of the entire Velebit area.

Changes in the vehicle's internal configuration adjust the center of gravity to guarantee a stable motion.

The main goal is to contribute to the understanding of rainfall-induced flow slides. For this purpose, a coupled hydromechanical constitutive model is combined with a simplified approach for the analysis of infinite slopes. Simple shear-test simulations are used to evaluate triggering perturbations and investigate the role of both initial suction and stress anisotropy in the activation of slope failures. The numerical simulations clearly show that different mechanisms of activation can be originated. The onset of instability is detected by introducing appropriate stability indices for distinct modes of failure: localised shear failure, static liquefaction and wetting-induced collapse. Critical intervals of <b>slope</b> <b>inclinations</b> are identified, cautioning that the predicted failure mode may change dramatically depending on initial conditions, slope angle and material properties. The numerical simulations demonstrate that, in particular circumstances, saturation of the pore space can be the unexpected result of a volumetric instability.
