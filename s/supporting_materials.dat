30|$|We {{fabricated}} {{the soft}} actuators (Fig. 5) using the Objet 350 Connex 3 and Agilista printers. It takes around one and half hours for Objet 350 Connex 3 and around two hours for Agilista to print the soft actuators. The connectors and base were printed by Objet 350 Connex 3. After printing, the actuators fabricated by Agilista were put inside water {{to dissolve the}} <b>support</b> <b>materials.</b> For the actuator fabricated by Objet 350 Connex 3, we removed the <b>support</b> <b>material</b> inside the groove at the bottom side (Fig. 2 b) to allow air passing through. Since the <b>support</b> <b>material</b> is granular and not very sticky, we could easily separate the <b>support</b> <b>material</b> from the chamber walls by simply pressing the chambers from external surfaces. Therefore, we did not remove all the <b>support</b> <b>materials</b> from the chambers and the actuator could be inflated. In fact, the actuator responded faster with <b>support</b> <b>material</b> inside the chambers compared to the actuator with empty chambers because less air was required to inflate the chambers. After fixing the connector on the soft actuator, we assembled the gripper. To compare the performance with and without <b>support</b> <b>material,</b> we also fabricated the same actuator by Objet 350 Connex 3 without using <b>support</b> <b>material</b> as shown in Fig. 12 a.|$|R

500|$|As {{part of the}} {{mediation}} between Kibaki and Odinga in 2008 the two parties agreed a series of accords. One of these was to establish the Commission of Inquiry into the Post-Election Violence, chaired by Kenyan judge Philip Waki to investigate the violence and particularly {{the actions of the}} police. Waki's report recommended that the Kenyan government set up a special tribunal to prosecute those responsible for the worst crimes. and although both Kibaki and Odinga voiced support for a local tribunal, the idea was rejected by the National Assembly. Waki passed his report, including a list of the names of those he considered most responsible for the violence back to Kofi Annan with instructions that it be passed to the International Criminal Court if progress with the local tribunal was not made. On 16 July 2009 the Waki commission delivered a copy of his report along with six boxes of documents and <b>supporting</b> <b>materials</b> to the International Criminal Court along with a sealed envelope containing a list of people who could be implicated in the violence. The prosecutor, Luis Moreno Ocampo opened the envelope, inspected its contents and re-sealed it. Initially the ICC gave the Kenyan government a deadline of July 2010 to establish a local tribunal before it would refer the case to the ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo. The [...] "Waki List" [...] has so far not been made public, and there is speculation that it may contain more names than the six who were initially indicted by the ICC; consequently there have been some calls in Kenya for either the ICC or Waki to release the list.|$|E

Removing the <b>support</b> <b>material</b> rapidly and efficiently is an important concern because the product life cycle is shorter than before. The measurement of pH value in solution {{is an important issue}} affecting the efficiency of removing <b>support</b> <b>material.</b> In this work, a method was proposed to enhance the efficiency of removing <b>support</b> <b>material</b> from rapid prototype parts using pH value compensation technology. It is found that the pH value 11. 6 is a good candidate for compensating the solution during removing process. The efficiency of removing <b>support</b> <b>material</b> increases with increasing the times of compensation. The savings in the removing time is up to 72 % using pH value compensation technology.

[...] The first recommendations of the subcommittee were published in 1966 as Appendix A of API Bulletin D12 (Well Data Glossary). [...] In April 1968, API published Bulletin D12A, which dealt solely with well numbering systems. [...] This publication was modified slightly in December 1970 and January 1979, and the 1979 edition (reissued in 1982 and 1985) is the most current version. In 1995, the Subcommittee drafted some modifications to the API numbering scheme, but the group was disbanded before the recommendations were published. [...] The 1979 standards are still in effect, but the publication is no longer available from API [...] In 2013, the PPDM Association issued an updated standard for the API Number (now called the US Well Number) which includes a requirement to identify all wellbores within each well.

40|$|The {{information}} {{presented in a}} document often consists of primary content as well as <b>supporting</b> <b>material</b> such as explanatory notes, detailed derivations, illustrations, and the like. We introduce a class of user interface techniques for fluid documents that supports the reader's shift to <b>supporting</b> <b>material</b> while maintaining {{the context of the}} primary material. Our approach initially minimizes the intrusion of <b>supporting</b> <b>material</b> by presenting it as a small visual cue near the annotated primary material. When the user expresses interest in the annotation, it expands smoothly to a readable size. At the same time, the primary material makes space for the expanded annotation. The expanded <b>supporting</b> <b>material</b> must be given space to occupy, and it must be made salient with respect to the surrounding primary material. These two aspects, space and salience, are subject to a negotiation between the primary and <b>supporting</b> <b>material.</b> This paper presents the components of our fluid document techniques and describes the negotiation architecture for ensuring that the presentations of both primary and <b>supporting</b> <b>material</b> are honored...|$|R

40|$|<b>Support</b> <b>material</b> {{is often}} {{utilised}} in asdditive manufacture to enable geometries {{that are not}} otherwise self-supporting. Despite the associated opportunities for innovation, the use of <b>support</b> <b>material</b> also introduces a series of limitations: additional material cost, cost of removal of <b>support</b> <b>material,</b> potential contamination of biocompatible materials, and entrapment of <b>support</b> <b>material</b> within cellular structures. This work presents a strategy for minimising the use of <b>support</b> <b>material</b> by comparing the geometric limits of an additive manufacture process to the build angles that exist within a proposed geometry. This method generates a feasibility map of the feasible build orientations for a proposed geometry with a given process. The method is applied to polyhedra that are suitable for close packing to identify space-filling tessellated structures that can be selfsupporting. The integrity of an FDM process is quantified, and using the associated feasibility map, self-supporting polyhedra are manufactured. These polyhedra are integrated with non-trivial geometries to achieve a reduction in consumed material of approximately 50 %...|$|R

40|$|Biofilms are sessile {{microbial}} communities {{attached to}} a surface, and offer a multitude of benefits to various biotechnological applications, such as anaerobic digestion. Therefore, engineering systems to promote biofilm formation is becoming increasingly desirable in the biotechnology sector. This thesis aimed to promote biofilm formation from the robust model methanogen, Methanosarcina barkeri, onto polymer <b>support</b> <b>materials</b> as a strategy for optimising the anaerobic digestion of domestic wastewater in peri-urban areas. A first step in this direction {{was to understand the}} effect of the <b>support</b> <b>material</b> on the biofilm-forming capabilities of M. barkeri. Various techniques were used throughout this thesis to show that the choice of <b>support</b> <b>material</b> was an important environmental factor in triggering different physiological responses from M. barkeri during biofilm formation. DLVO modelling, surface characterisation and static adhesion assays revealed the important role of the physicochemical surface properties of M. barkeri and the six <b>support</b> <b>materials</b> for initial microbial adhesion. M. barkeri was shown to exhibit different abilities to attach to the <b>support</b> <b>materials,</b> with the type of material strongly influencing the extent of initial attachment. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, zeta potential analysis and fluorescence microscopy suggested that significant modifications to the cell surface occurred in response to attachment to a favourable <b>support</b> <b>material</b> (PVC), with increased levels of cell surface polysaccharides detected in biofilms attached to PVC compared to PETG. Furthermore, microbial attachment to PVC caused a significant higher relative abundance of proteins involved in methanogenesis, metabolism, cell wall biogenesis and EPS production compared to biofilms attached to PETG. The results from this thesis suggest that M. barkeri showcases different physiological responses for biofilm formation depending on the <b>support</b> <b>material.</b> Therefore, the choice of <b>support</b> <b>material</b> is an important design parameter for retaining microbial biomass within AD reactors, and should be considered in future design frameworks for high rate anaerobic digestion. ...|$|R
