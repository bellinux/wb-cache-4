5|$|As long as maple <b>syrup</b> {{does not}} have an {{off-flavour}} and is of a uniform colour and clean and free from turbidity and sediment, it can be labelled as one of the A grades. If it exhibits any of these problems, it does not meet Grade A requirements and must be labelled as Processing Grade maple <b>syrup</b> and may not be sold in containers smaller than 5 gallons. If maple <b>syrup</b> does not meet the requirements of Processing Grade maple <b>syrup</b> (including a fairly characteristic maple taste), it is classified as Substandard.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAgave <b>syrups</b> {{are gaining}} {{popularity}} as new natural sweeteners. Identification, classification and discrimination by infrared spectroscopy coupled to chemometrics (NIR-MIR-SIMCA-PCA) and HPAEC-PAD of agave <b>syrups</b> from natural sweeteners were achieved. MIR-SIMCA-PCA {{allowed us to}} classify the natural sweeteners according to their natural source. Natural <b>syrups</b> exhibited differences in the MIR spectra region 1500 – 900 cm− 1. The agave <b>syrups</b> displayed strong absorption in the MIR spectra region 1061 – 1063 cm− 1, in agreement with their high fructose content. Additionally, MIR-SIMCA-PCA allowed us to differentiate among <b>syrups</b> from different Agave species (Agave tequilana and Agave salmiana). Thin-layer chromatography and HPAEC-PAD revealed glucose, fructose, and sucrose as the principal carbohydrates {{in all of the}} <b>syrups.</b> Oligosaccharide profiles showed that A. tequilana <b>syrups</b> are mainly composed of fructose (> 60 %) and fructooligosaccharides, while A. salmiana <b>syrups</b> contain more sucrose (28 – 32 %).

40|$|Refrigerated doughs develop <b>syruping</b> upon {{prolonged}} storage. To {{assess the}} role of arabinoxylans (AX), in this phenomenon, {{the evolution of the}} AX population and <b>syruping</b> in refrigerated doughs during storage were studied. When doughs were kept at 6 degreesC for up to 34 days of storage, dough <b>syruping</b> increased from 0 % (fresh dough) to 22 % of dough weight, reaching a plateau after 16 days of storage.

5|$|Maple <b>syrup</b> is a <b>syrup</b> {{usually made}} from the xylem sap of sugar maple, red maple, or black maple trees, {{although}} {{it can also be}} made from other maple species. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before the winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated <b>syrup.</b>|$|E

5|$|Red maple is {{also used}} for the {{production}} of maple <b>syrup,</b> though the hard maples Acer saccharum (sugar maple) and Acer nigrum (black maple) are more commonly utilized. One study compared the sap and <b>syrup</b> from the sugar maple with those of the red maple, {{as well as those of}} the Acer saccharinum (silver maple), Acer negundo (boxelder), and Acer platanoides (Norway maple), and all were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality. However, the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple, and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the <b>syrup.</b> This being the case, red maple can only be tapped for <b>syrup</b> before the buds emerge, making the season very short.|$|E
5|$|The sugar may {{be transported}} in bulk {{to the country}} {{where it will be}} used and the {{refining}} process often takes place there. The first stage is known as affination and involves immersing the sugar crystals in a concentrated <b>syrup</b> that softens and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them. The crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water. The resulting <b>syrup</b> is treated either by a carbonatation or by a phosphatation process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the <b>syrup</b> and when this is filtered out, many of the impurities are removed at the same time. Removal of color is achieved by using either a granular activated carbon or an ion-exchange resin. The sugar <b>syrup</b> is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out. The liquor is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus liquor is made into refiners' molasses.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>syruping</b> in refrigerated doughs upon prolonged storage and {{different aspects of}} arabinoxylan (AX) hydrolysis was investigated using Triticum aestivum xylanase inhibitor (TAXI) and different xylanases in the dough formula.

Selective reduction of part of the flour endogenous xylanase activity in dough by added TAXI reduced dough <b>syruping</b> after 12 and 20 days of storage by 50 %, providing straightforward evidence for the involvement of xylanases and, thus, AX in the <b>syruping</b> phenomenon. Addition of xylanases with different inhibitor sensitivities [an inhibition-sensitive Bacillus subtilis xylanase (XBSi) as well as a noninhibited mutant (XBSni) thereof] to dough confirmed the importance of xylanases in dough <b>syruping,</b> on one hand, and the power of wheat flour TAXI to constitute a significant barrier against xylanase-mediated dough <b>syruping,</b> on the other hand. Use of xylanases with different substrate selectivities [an Aspergillus aculeatus xylanase (XAA) versus XBSni] showed degradation of water-extractable AX (WE-AX) and solubilized AX to low molecular weight molecules rather than the conversion of water-unextractable AX (WU-AX) to high molecular weight water extractable components to be the main factor influencing dough <b>syruping.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
