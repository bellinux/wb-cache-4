40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of investigation on the influence of an ohmic shunt located at various spatial positions on the solar cell performance by distributed diode model based simulations. By systematically varying the parameters such as shunt resistance, proximity to metallization, shunt area, and irradiance a deep insight about the <b>shunt</b> <b>impact</b> on the solar cell performance have been obtained. Further, effect of spatial positioning of shunts has been investigated by considering shunted region of same area and severity at various locations of the solar cell, via the simulation approach. The presented simulation approach has been experimentally validated. The influence of shunt on the relative power and relative open circuit voltage has been studied considering different irradiance levels. The study revealed new insights about significance of spatial positions of the shunts and the proximity of finger and busbar metallization. A dramatic improvement in the solar cell's electrical performance can be gained by either preventing the occurrence of shunts at the identified critical locations or isolating them by laser or chemical technique or removing them.

40|$|Hip {{fracture}} is {{a common}} and potentially serious problem for the elderly. At least 90 % of hip injuries (especially fractures) in older people are caused by falls resulting in direct impact to the hip area. 1 - 3 Hip protectors are devices worn over the hip and upper thigh {{that are designed to}} reduce the risk for hip injury by reducing impact forces on the hip. Two different types of hip protectors are available: hard hip protectors that <b>shunt</b> <b>impact</b> forces into the surrounding tissues, and soft hip protectors that absorb the energy of impacts. 2 Biomechanical models suggest soft hip protectors may offer greater force attenuation than hard shell varieties. 4, 5 Systematic reviews combining data on the different types of hip protectors suggest that especially in institutions (e. g., nursing homes), the use of hip protectors reduces the risk of fracture by 20 % to 60 %; 6 - 8 however, hip protectors have not been found universally effective in all trials, 9, 10 particularly among people living at home. Also, these reviews did not make comparisons between individual types of hip protectors (e. g., hard versus soft, or between specific brands). This report will review the comparative clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of hip protectors to prevent injuries for residents in long-term care settings...|$|R

In recent years powerful tools for imaging inhomogeneous properties have been established. Examples of measurements {{show that the}} potential distribution is a key parameter. A circuit simulation program with input options for several inhomogeneous parameter sets {{was developed in the}} European project PORTRAIT. The program is introduced and applications are demonstrated on example situations of parameter inhomogeneities: the potential distribution caused by a severe <b>shunt,</b> the <b>impact</b> of regions of low lifetime beneath the front metallisation, different lifetime distributions for a n-type solar cell with rear side emitter, the impact on the IV parameters when the two parameters lifetime and parallel resistance are inhomogeneous and the fill factor loss caused by finger interruptions. Excellent agreement of the simulated potential distribution resulting from strong shunts with Voc-PL measurements is demonstrated. The experimental observation that higher efficiencies are reached if impurities are concentrated locally instead of widely spread is confirmed. For finger interruptions a strong position dependence of these interruptions was observed...|$|R
40|$|Hip {{fractures}} {{are strongly}} associated with sideway falls to the hip, poor response time, lack of soft tissue energy absorption, and subpar proximal femur strength (Cummings and Nevitt, 2001). Hip protectors are a common intervention aimed to lower the femoral neck loads below the fracture threshold and {{reduce the risk of}} hip fracture (Robinovitch et al., 2009). These protective devices typically consist of a padded material embedded in undergarments which absorb or <b>shunt</b> <b>impact</b> energies. Lack of testing standards for these protective devices have resulted in many unregulated hip protectors produced, a wide range of biomechanical test results represented by various test systems, and inconclusive clinical trials (Combes and Price, 2014; Kannus et al., 1999; Laing et al., 2011; van Schoor et al., 2006). The International Hip Protector Research Group (IHPRG) have consolidated evidence-based recommendations for the specifications and parameters for a biomechanical hip protector test system (Robinovitch et al., 2009). A drop tower and surrogate pelvis test system was developed to evaluate various hip protectors in a simulated sideways fall from a range of impact velocities. This test system was validated using the IHPRG recommendations and compared with femoral neck loads for unpadded and padded conditions in Laing et al. (2011). After testing combinations from 3 different foam products and 2 different trochanteric soft tissue thicknesses (TSTT), the selected baseline hip form consisted of a FlexFoam-iT! V product at a 24 mm TSTT. When tested at a 3. 4 m/s impact velocity, this baseline hip form had an average peak femoral neck force of 2145 N and an average peak neck force attenuation of 20. 1 % and 25. 9 % for Hipsaver and Safehip Air-X protectors respectively, which closely matched the test system used in Laing et al. (2011). The test system with this baseline hip form was then verified to have excellent reliability between trials (ICC = 0. 99 average across impact velocities) and poor reliability between hip forms (ICC range = - 0. 18 to 0. 404 between impact velocities). Additionally, the hip form did not incur any visible interior or exterior damage after being drop tested for 60 repeated impacts at the specified various velocities. Only a few studies had previously looked into pressure distribution of hip protectors during simulated falls. Limitations in literature include the evaluation of pressure only at the outer surface of the hip protector and at low impact velocities. The Tekscan I-Scan pressure mapping system allowed for measurements directly at the hip protector-skin interface for impact velocities up to 3. 4 m/s. The goal {{of this study was to}} look at significant differences between hip protector conditions for various force and pressure-related outcome variables, investigate which pressure-related variables were related to the traditional biomechanical effectiveness metric, and to provide initial insight regarding the protective mechanism of hip protector designs. Significant differences between the unpadded and the four hip protectors were seen except for total force at 3. 4 m/s. Significant associations were observed between peak neck force attenuation and average pressure at 2. 8 m/s and contact area at 2. 8 m/s and 3. 4 m/s. Although peak pressure was independent on peak neck force attenuation, it can be used to distinguish the mechanism of hip protectors where high peak pressure relates to energy-shunting and lower peak pressure relates energy-absorbing. The initial insights show potential for further investigation to use pressure-related variables in hip protector testing and design...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{classification}} of defects in large-area Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 (CIGS) modules using electroluminescence (EL) and lock-in thermography (LIT) imaging techniques. We observe {{three types of}} defects, which we name according to their respective appearance in EL images as “Smears”, “Freckles”, and “Doughnuts”. “Smears” consist of a small dark spot and a tail (length: 2 to 12 mm), which smears out over several cells. In both EL and LIT images, Smears appear as <b>shunts</b> with negative <b>impact</b> on the cell performance. “Freckles” appear in EL images as dark spots with sharp contours (diameter: 10 to 200 μm). Doughnuts are visible in EL images as dark spots (diameter: 10 to 50 μm), surrounded by bright edge (diameter: 20 to 150 μm). Freckles and Doughnuts may originate from impurities in the CIGS absorber layer, and ZnO layer, respectively. Their appearances in EL and LIT images show that these two defect types have minor electrical impact and may result from difference in emissivity of materials. However, both of them cause a reduction of active area, and thus the short circuit current. Preliminary results from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) indicate the presence of carbon and potassium containing contamination...|$|R

Five hip protector brands were chosen to represent different products available on the market and the two mechanisms employed in reducing the force of an <b>impact</b> (<b>shunting</b> or absorbing). Ten pairs of each type (20 pads for each brand) were tested using a 1. 8 -m Instron Dynatup 9250 HV vertical impact testing tower. The impact testing system was specifically designed for this study by creating a simulated trochanter to provide more accurately a impact area similar to that of a real hip bone. The hip protectors were impacted once a day for 3 consecutive days. Repeated impacts demonstrated the pads’ decreased ability to either absorb or shunt force in all types of hip protectors. However, the mean forces were still in the protective range (force below fracture threshold of 3100 N) for 3 of the 5 brands tested after 3 impacts. The protective properties of external hip protectors do degrade after repeated impacts. The degree of degradation differs from brand to brand. Regardless of type, most pads were still able to bring the force of impact below the fracture threshold of 3100 N. Future studies need to address the issue of durability of different types/brands of hip protectors after repeated laundering and fall impacts to determine when should they be replaced.

40|$|Abstract Background Idiopathic normal {{pressure}} hydrocephalus (iNPH) is {{a potentially}} reversible cause of dementia and gait disturbance that is typically treated by operative placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The outcome from shunting is variable, and some {{evidence suggests that}} the presence of comorbid Alzheimer's disease (AD) may <b>impact</b> <b>shunt</b> outcome. Evidence also suggests that AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may predict the presence of AD. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship between the phosphorylated tau/amyloid beta 1 - 42 (ptau/Aβ 1 - 42) ratio in ventricular CSF and shunt outcome in patients with iNPH. Methods We conducted a prospective trial with a cohort of 39 patients with suspected iNPH. Patients were clinically and psychometrically assessed prior to and approximately 4 months after ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Lumbar and ventricular CSF obtained intraoperatively, and tissue from intraoperative cortical biopsies were analyzed for AD biomarkers. Outcome measures included performance on clinical symptom scales, supplementary gait measures, and standard psychometric tests. We investigated relationships between the ptau/Aβ 1 - 42 ratio in ventricular CSF and cortical AD pathology, initial clinical features, shunt outcome, and lumbar CSF ptau/Aβ 1 - 42 ratios in the patients in our cohort. Results We found that high ptau/Aβ 1 - 42 ratios in ventricular CSF correlated with the presence of cortical AD pathology. At baseline, iNPH patients with ratio values most suggestive of AD presented with better gait performance but poorer cognitive performance. Patients with high ptau/Aβ 1 - 42 ratios also showed a less robust response to shunting on both gait and cognitive measures. Finally, in a subset of 18 patients who also underwent lumbar puncture, ventricular CSF ratios were significantly correlated with lumbar CSF ratios. Conclusions Levels of AD biomarkers in CSF correlate with the presence of cortical AD pathology and predict aspects of clinical presentation in iNPH. Moreover, preliminary evidence suggests that CSF biomarkers of AD may prove useful for stratifying shunt prognosis in patients being evaluated and treated for this condition. </p...|$|R

40|$|To enable {{photovoltaics}} (PV) {{to become}} a leading source of energy in a low-carbon future, the cost of solar electricity needs to {{be reduced to a}} level that can compete with current electricity prices. From a technology perspective, this reduction can be achieved by increasing the solar cell&# 146;s conversion efficiency at similar or reduced manufacturing costs. This thesis describes the development of a high efficiency Si solar cell technology that has the potential to lower the cost per Watt of solar cells, through the use of laser-doped selective emitter and localised rear contacts. This thesis begins with the development of laser-doped selective emitter (LDSE) technology to overcome the limitations of the front surface design associated with the industrial screen-printed solar cells. In this technology, laser doping is employed to simplify the formation of selective emitters that were conventionally fabricated by photolithographic patterning and long, high-temperature phosphorus diffusion. Defect studies and device loss analysis are performed to facilitate the selection of the most suitable laser parameters for the laser doping application. By using a continuous wave 532 nm laser, a sheet resistance as low as 2 &# 937;/&# 61591; is achieved in the selective emitters with minimal laser-induced defects while maintaining a short process time of several seconds per wafer. Optimisation of the laser doping parameters leads to a cell efficiency of 19 % being demonstrated on large area, commercial-grade CZ p-type wafers. This thesis also explores the application of an identical LDSE cell structure on commercial-grade CZ n-type wafers. In this case, the selectively-doped n+ regions at the front surface act as a front surface field (FSF) while the screen-printed Al-alloyed region at the rear surface forms the emitter of the n-type solar cells. A study of the Al-alloyed emitter formation with respect to firing conditions is presented with the aid of SEM imaging. A final Voc approaching 650 mV and pFF of 83 % demonstrate the successful formation of p+ emitter with minimum junction shunting. During the development of the n-type LDSE technology, an &# 147;apparent&# 148; shunting behaviour is observed in the cell areas that are not well-plated. Investigative work involving Photoluminescence imaging and PC 1 D modeling is detailed to further understand the cause of the &# 147;apparent&# 148; <b>shunting</b> and its <b>impact</b> on the cell performance. Through this investigation, solutions are devised and successfully implemented to overcome the &# 147;apparent shunting&# 148;. Further optimisation on the phosphorus FSF diffusion enables the achievement of a FF approaching 80 % and a final cell efficiency of 18. 7 %. The final stage of this work presents the development of a novel next-generation LDSE cell structure that focuses on improving the rear surface design while retaining the excellent front surface design of the LDSE cell. This cell structure employs a commercially-manufacturable thermal-SiO 2 /PECVDSiNx stack layer for rear surface passivation; and relies on the use of boron laser doping in conjunction with sputtered Al for localised rear contact formation. Test structures with an implied Voc over 700 mV (prior to laser doping) indicates high surface-passivation quality given by the SiO 2 /SiNx stack following thermal anneal. Demonstration of sheet resistance as low as 5 &# 937; /&# 61591; on the boron laser-doped p+ regions highlights the potential for low-temperature Al sintering to form an ohmic contact. Different geometries for the rear contact pattern are designed and implemented to establish optimum current collection. By improving the rear surface design, independently-confirmed cell efficiencies as high as 20 % are achieved on large area, standard commercial-grade p-type wafers, with the potential for further efficiency increase exceeding 21 %. These are believed to be record performance cell for this type of wafer. These results suggest that this new generation of LDSE cells have the potential of becoming an attractive cell technology in the PV industry...|$|R
