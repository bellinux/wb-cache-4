50|$|It is {{well known}} that Janáček’s music was greatly {{influenced}} by the nature and sounds of Czech speech and language. One may begin to clearly recognize this influence as it appears in the relationship between the musical motif and Czech words. For example, when a word in Czech changes tense, it often changes the sound of the vowel in that word, paralleling Janáček’s contour alteration of a short motif. Also, in Czech, the first syllable of a word is stressed, allowing distinction of each word by the beginning sound. The avoidance of ending a motif on the downbeat could be seen as analogous Czech speech avoiding stress on any syllable other than the first. Third, the final syllable of a Czech word is to receive full value without changing the pitch or weakening the sound. This closely relates to Janáček’s idea of maintaining a single dynamic in his motifs. Janáček also had a strong interest in the melody of speech (see quote above): intonation, <b>stress,</b> <b>length,</b> and pitch.|$|E
40|$|First {{principle}} based {{prediction of}} mean flow quantities of wall-bounded turbulent flows (channel, pipe, and {{turbulent boundary layer}} - TBL) is of great importance from both physics and engineering standpoints. Here (Part I), we present a symmetry-based approach which derives analytic expressions governing the mean velocity profile (MVP) from an innovative Lie-group analysis. The new approach begins by identifying a set of order functions (e. g. <b>stress</b> <b>length,</b> shear-induced eddy length), in analogy with the order parameter in Landau's mean-field theory, which aims at capturing symmetry aspects of the fluctuations (e. g. Reynolds stress, dissipation). The order functions are assumed to satisfy a dilation group invariance - representing {{the effects of the}} wall on fluctuations - which allows us to postulate three new kinds of invariant solutions of the mean momentum equation (MME), focusing on group invariants of the order functions (rather than those of the mean velocity as done in previous studies). The first - a power law solution - gives functional forms for the viscous sublayer, the buffer layer, the log-layer, and a newly identified central `core' (for channel and pipe, but non-existent for TBL). The second - a defect power law of form $ 1 -r^{m}$ ($r$ being the distance from the center line) - describes the `bulk zone' (the region of balance between production and dissipation). The third - a relation between the group invariants of the <b>stress</b> <b>length</b> function and its first derivative - describes scaling transition between adjacent layers. A combination of these three expressions yields a multi-layer formula covering the entire flow domain, identifying three important parameters: scaling exponent, layer thickness, and transition sharpness. All three kinds of invariant solutions are validated, individually and in combination, by data from direct numerical simulations (DNS). Comment: 25 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the underlying mechanism(s) by which birds modulate the mechanical power output of their pectoralis muscle in relation to changing aerodynamic power requirements associated with varying flight speed. Because of its size and central role in wing depression and lift production, the pectoralis muscle produces most of the mechanical power required for steady flight (Rosser and George, 1986; Dial, 1992; Dial and Biewener, 1993; Biewener et al., 1998). The production of mechanical power is of central importance to various modes of locomotion, including swimming, flying and acceleration or climbing in a terrestrial environment (McMahon, 1984; Vogel, 1994).

Peristalsis {{is one of the}} most efficient of these mechanisms and offers considerable promise in microscale fluidics. Electrokinetic peristalsis has recently also stimulated significant attention. Electrical and magnetic fields also offer an excellent mode for regulating flows. Motivated by novel applications in electro-conductive microchannel transport systems, the current article investigates analytically the electromagnetic pumping of non-Newtonian aqueous electrolytes via peristaltic waves in a two-dimensional microchannel with different peristaltic waves propagating at the upper and lower channel wall (complex wavy scenario). The Stokes couple stress model is deployed to capture micro-structural characteristics of real working fluids. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and momentum conservation, electro-kinetic and magnetic body forces, are formulated in two-dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates. The transport equations are transformed from the wave frame to the laboratory frame and the electrical field terms rendered into electrical potential terms via the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, Debye length approximation and ionic Nernst Planck equation. The dimensionless emerging linearized electro-magnetic boundary value problem is solved using integral methods.

40|$|AbstractAdhesively bonded pipe joints are {{extensively}} used in pipelines. In {{the present}} work, cohesive zone model (CZM) based analytical solutions are derived for the bonded pipe joints under torsion. The {{concept of the}} minimum relative interface rotation ϕm is introduced and used as the fundamental variable to express all other parameters, such as external torsion load, distribution of interfacial shear <b>stress,</b> <b>length</b> of elastic zone and softening zone, etc. It is found that when the bond length of the pipe joint is longer than a certain value, further increase in bond length cannot bring any significant increase in torsion load capacity. Given that the bond length of the pipe joint is long enough, the torsion load capacity is indeed independent of the shape of cohesive laws and the bond length. Consequently, simplified expressions of the torsion load capacity are derived {{as a function of}} the interface fracture energy, torsion stiffness of the pipe, and the geometric properties of the pipe joints. Depending on the torsion stiffness ratio of the pipe and the coupler, the macroscopic-debonding can initiate at the right end, left end or both ends simultaneously. It is interesting to note that the maximum torsion load capacity is achieved when the torsion stiffness of the pipe and the coupler are identical. Good agreement with finite element analysis (FEA) result validates the accuracy of the current model. Fracture energy based formulas of the torsion load capacity derived in the present work can be directly used in the design of adhesively bonded pipe joints...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 43 - 49) The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the relationship between negative stress in one's personal life and the work-related variables of job tension, job satisfaction, and subjective job performance. Locus of control and social support were examined as moderator variables, thought to "buffer" the effects of <b>stress.</b> <b>Length</b> of time on the job was also taken into account. Fifty-six registered nurses at Saint Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles, California served as subjects. All were female, ranging in age from 23 to 59. Subjects completed a series of questionnaires which assessed negative stressful life experiences, perceived locus of control, amount of social support, job tension, job satisfaction, and subjective job performance. Negative stress, locus of control, social support, and their interactions were thought to be "predictors" of job tension, job satisfaction, and subjective job performance. Length of time on the job was treated as a covariate. Each of the work-related variables was analyzed separately. Hypotheses were proposed for univariate (Pearson Correlation) and multivariate (Hierarchical Multiple Regression) analyses. The univariate analyses provided a means of comparison to existing literature on stressful life changes. The multivariate analyses provided a better statistical procedure for analyzing multiple variables. The results indicated that length of time on the job and locus of control most reliably predict job tension and job satisfaction. Less job tension and more job satisfaction was reported by nurses who had worked on the job longer and had an internal locus of control. Negative stressful life experiences were not significantly correlated with any of the work-related variables. In addition, subjective job performance ratings may be of little value as valid measures of performance appraisal. The failure to support many of the predictions are discussed in terms of the limitations of this study. Implications and recommendations for future research are also discussed, as well as the importance of utilizing a multivariate approach in the study of personal life stress and its role in the work place...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{occupational}} stress on public servants {{who seek to}} protect and maintain security {{for the general public}} have begun to receive more attention in recent years. Most of this research has focused on police officers. Much less attention has been directed towards other first responders (i. e., firefighters, paramedics) except in comparisons with police samples or inclusion in mixed first responder groups. Investigative efforts that specifically target firefighters and their unique responses to occupational stress, the vulnerabilities of negative responses to stress, and the variables that enhance and maintain resiliency in these first responders is limited. Moreover, cardiovascular risk has been recognized in firefighters. However research has been focused on examining physical variables related to this risk with little attention to psychological contributions, particularly the role of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on cardiovascular disease (CVD). The goals of the current investigation were to (1) review research that has been conducted on stress in firefighters, (2) examine the effects of job <b>stress,</b> <b>length</b> of service, and critical incidents on developing PTSD and CVD risk (3) evaluate the relationship between PTSD and CVD risk in firefighters (4) increase our understanding of the manifestations of stress in this population, and (5) provide organizations and treatment providers potentially useful information for developing and improving assessment and intervention strategies. Firefighters from the Broward Sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s Office special operations teams (N= 87) were the participants. Self-report measures and annual physical examination data provided information regarding CVD risk (weight, height, blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, physical exercise), job stress, trauma exposure, service length, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Results indicated statistically significant relationships between PTSD symptomatology and current smoking status, triglycerides levels, and the number of CVD risk factors. Neither the number of experienced critical incidents, nor the number of service years was associated with PTSD symptomatology. Organizational job stress variables were associated with PTSD symptoms, but not directly with CVD risk. Collectively these findings suggest the reaction to traumatic experiences may be a better indicator of PTSD symptom development, than the actual number of traumatic events experienced. Moreover, the presence of PTSD symptoms may negatively influence overall CVD risk...|$|E

This research aimed to provide an understanding into the experiences of counselling and clinical doctoral training on trainees and their partners.

A mixed methods design was chosen to provide an empirical view of stress, dyadic coping and relationship satisfaction of trainees. It adopted a survey design and {{an analysis of the}} processes trainees and partners experience throughout the course as a couple through using a Grounded Theory approach. In total 50 trainees in clinical and counselling psychology took part in the survey study that measured perceived stress, dyadic coping and their relationship satisfaction. Data was analysed using regression analysis to explore relationships between the three constructs. The analysis revealed similarities between clinical and counselling trainees in terms of perceived stress, coping and relationship satisfaction. Regression analysis suggested trainees’ relationship satisfaction was predicted by number of children, communication of <b>stress,</b> <b>length</b> of relationship and length of time cohabiting. Fourteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with counselling doctoral trainees and partners. The interviews were transcribed and analysed in accordance with a constructivist version of grounded theory as developed by Charmaz (2006). The grounded theory study revealed a central storyline of 'a journey towards {{the light at the end}} of the tunnel' with the social process of striving for equilibrium. This referred to the journey participants experienced whilst the trainee was on the course and highlighted a process as trainees and partners moved through as they developed and adapted to their new lives. The idea of the course being temporary was a thread through the model as participants worked through the stresses whilst focusing on the finishing line at the end of the course. Conflicts arose with participants with children who appeared to undergo a strengthened version of the model. This research provided implications for further specialised support for trainees and partners undergoing the doctoral programmes. It hoped to highlight the difficulties and strengths couples endure on the programme and provides implications for universities and personal therapists to offer systemic support for couples to manage the processes together, making the adjustment process more seamless and meaningful to the couple...|$|E

Very few studies on job stress have focused on school administrators. This research was designed to explore the impact of occupational stress on public school administrators in Minnesota. Significant differences between administrative levels were hypothesized for the following variables: twenty individual occupational stressors, an index of global occupational <b>stress,</b> <b>length</b> of work week, and four measures of facet-free job satisfaction;This cross-sectional study of school administrator stress employed a self-administered questionnaire consisting of seventy-seven items. The scales and individual questions from earlier research on occupational stress, job satisfaction, and related variables were field tested and refined through two pilot projects;Four hundred fourteen of the 424 superintendents employed by public schools in Minnesota were mailed the questionnaire.

Seven hundred forty-eight administrators responded with a valid questionnaire for a return rate of 87 percent. The {{data were analyzed using}} descriptive statistics, chi square analysis, and Pearson product moment correlations;Statistically significant differences (p 3 ̆c 0. 01) between the three samples of administrators were found on eight of the twenty occupational stressors.

Forty to 49 percent of each sample reported their work environment was either 2 ̆ 2 always 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 usually 2 ̆ 2 stressful. There {{were no significant differences between}} the three stratified samples on four measures of facet-free job satisfaction. Seventy-three percent of all administrators were satisfied with their administrative position, 11 percent were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, and 16 percent were dissatisfied;A correlation matrix analysis identified the following clusters of stress variables: role conflict; responsibility for people; work overload and role expansion; special education and legal compliance; and conflicting demands. The stress cluster of responsibility for people had the highest ranking individual stressors of any of the clusters for both samples of principals. For superintendent respondents, the highest stress was experienced by the cluster of conflicting demands;In conclusion, on most of the independent variables, there were no significant differences between the three administrative samples. There was a slight tendency for secondary principals to report more occupational stress than either elementary principals or superintendents.

In order to evaluate the effects of cold stress in the period of germination and seedling and recovery percent of rice cultivars, two independent tests were performed in 2006 - 2007 in Rice Research Institution at Amol city. An experiment was conducted by split split plots within a randomized block design (CRD) with 54 caring composition, 3 replications and 6 cultivars were used. In this study, main plots were temperature, sub plots were length of stress and sub sub plots were cultivars. The levels of temperature including 10 oc (intense stress), 14 0 C (critical temperature) and 32 0 C (improving temperature, control) and levels of stress time 12, 24, 48 hours and cultivars of local Tarom, Domsiya, Hybrid, Nemat, Gerde, Unda were selected two by two based on quality of product and then performed in unit area and finally resistance against cold respectively. On the period of germination with decreasing temperature from 32 0 C to 14 0 C and from 14 0 C to 10 0 C, total decrease studied indices with exception of percentage of damage to seed are meaningful and similar reaction in recovery section of germination is obvious. In the period of seedling, we can see a meaningful decrease in significant level 1 % about of decreasing temperature of total stress, percentage of damage to seedling, vigour of seedling. By increasing temperature in the period of stress of germination, there is a meaningful increase level 1 % of total studied features with the exception of damage of seed. In the period of recovery of germination, there is a meaningful increase in significant level 1 % of total studied features with the exception of damage to seed. In the period of stress of germination, there is a meaningful decrease at total features with the exception of sensitive to stress, percentage of damage to seedling and vigour of seedling and aceous recovery are similar in the period of seedling. By decreasing time of stress in the period of germination, there is a meaningful decrease by percent of damage total features with exception of rate of germination, percentage of germination. In the period of germination recovery, there is a meaningful increase in length if radicle, length of stem, percentage of germination and rate of germination and other features have meaningful decrease. In the period of seedling recovery, by decreasing time of <b>stress,</b> <b>length</b> of shoot, length of radicle, weight of wet, dry root and other features have meaningful increase. The effects of cultivar in total tests and stages, was significant level 1 %. The results show that, feature of germination and length of stem and percentage of damage to seed in different cultivars are various. In the period of recovery, percentage of germination, rate of germination and percentage of damage to seeds, had correct criteria for selecting cultivars sensitive to cold stress. Low temperature can delay pitch and growth of transplant for more time. We can use height of shoot in rice as an index for determining of cultivars resistant to cold. According to these results, we decide precisely for re cultivate rice store or selecting to resistant cultivar by introducing Nemat cultivar in the period of germination and hybrid cultivar in the period of seedling aceous as resistant cultivar during occurring stress of cold. </p...|$|E
