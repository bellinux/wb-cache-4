50|$|On {{the surface}} of lakes, or other bodies of still freshwater, {{congelation}} ice is often called black Ice. This ice has frozen without many air bubbles trapped inside, making it transparent. Its transparency reveals the colour, usually black, of the water beneath it, hence the name. This {{is in contrast to}} snow ice, sometimes called <b>slush</b> <b>ice,</b> which is formed when slush (water saturated snow) refreezes. Snow ice is white due to the presence of air bubbles.|$|E

5000|$|Machines to make frozen {{beverages}} {{were invented}} by Omar Knedlik {{in the late}} 1950s. The idea for a <b>slushed</b> <b>ice</b> drink came when Knedlik's soda fountain broke down, forcing him to put his sodas in a freezer to stay cool, which caused them to become slushy. The result was popular with customers, which gave him the idea to make a machine to help make a [...] "slushy" [...] from carbonated beverages. When it became popular, Knedlik hired artist Ruth E. Taylor to create a name and logo for his invention. She created the ICEE name and designed the original logo, which is used today.

50|$|Slush, {{also called}} <b>slush</b> <b>ice,</b> is a slurry mixture of small ice {{crystals}} (e.g., snow) and liquid water. In the natural environment, slush forms when ice or snow melts. This often mixes with dirt and other materials, {{resulting in a}} gray or muddy brown color. Often, solid ice or snow will block the drainage of fluid water from slushy areas, so slush often goes through multiple freeze/thaw cycles before completely disappearing. In areas where road salt is used to clear roadways, slush forms at lower temperatures than it would ordinarily, and only in salted areas; this can produce {{a number of different}} consistencies over the same geographical area.|$|E
5000|$|The idea {{of having}} an {{exhibition}} ice hockey game outdoors in Las Vegas belongs to Rich Rose, president of Caesars World Sports and a Rangers fan, who first proposed it in 1988. His idea was met with criticism and incredulity, but when he called the NHL league office in 1991, the call was routed to Steve Flatow, the NHL's marketing director at the time, who {{thought it was an}} intriguing idea and advised Rose on how to get it approved. He suggested Rose speak first to the Los Angeles Kings, whose roster included Wayne Gretzky. With their interest, Flatow believed the Rangers would also be interested, and the game would showcase two high-profile teams from the two largest markets. Rose was able to convince the King's executive vice-president, Roy Mlakar, and the team's owner Bruce McNall. After that, Flatow helped Rose contact the Rangers, who agreed to play, the event was scheduled for September 27, 1991. The temporary seats and rink were erected for a total cost of $135,000, and were ready two days {{prior to the start of}} the game. The ice was laid down for Bob May of Ice Systems of America, under the directions of Michael Rzechula and Robert Krolak from ITI (now Ice Rink Supply) through the use of the IRS patented family of Ice Building Products: <b>Slush</b> <b>Ice,</b> Instant Ice, Base Ice, Ice Building Additive and Slick Ice. According to May, the outside ice rink in Las Vegas was [...] "a big challenge", using three times the refrigeration equipment as one would for a regular rink. The lines on the rink were not painted, as is usually done, but were fabric strips laid into the ice. The boards featured rotating and lit advertising panels to display different sponsors. This was a concept and technology that was still in its infancy but later implemented in many NHL arenas. Among the games in-board advertisers: Toyota, Target, ITT Sheraton, Budweiser, Thrifty car rental, and Upper Deck trading cards.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1998 The {{southern}} Lake Michigan nearshore zone is ice {{covered for}} two to four months each year. Daily observations in January 1991 document {{the effect of this}} seasonal ice on sediment transport along the Illinois shoreline of the lake. Three distinct types of ice are found in the nearshore zone. Each of these ice types has a different effect on nearshore sediment but all contribute to ice rafting sediment alongshore and cross shore. The Nearshore Ice Complex (NIC) is a large, 'solid' mass of ice that builds lakeward from the shoreline. At Gillson Beach in southwest Lake Michigan, the NIC reached a maximum width of 180 m and formed ridges up to 4 m above lake level. The volume of this NIC was 420 m 3 of ice per meter of beach width. This ice entrained 2. 3 m 3 of sand per meter of beach. The NIC is a dynamic feature that grows and decays in response to incident waves and the amount of <b>slush</b> <b>ice</b> in the nearshore zone. Destruction of the NIC by waves leads to ice rafting of sand. Anchor ice is ice that is attached to the lakebed; it forms on sand, pebble and cobble bottoms in the nearshore zone. Anchor ice formation is common; it formed on 14 of 32 nights at one site. Anchor ice forms on cold, clear nights with offshore winds and is released from the bed and floats to the surface with entrained sediment when the water warms during the day. The formation and release of anchor ice transports sand in calm conditions. I estimate that anchor ice rafted 0. 85 m 3 of sand from each m of beach at one site during the winter of 1991. There is a continuum of anchor ice morphologies that {{is a function of the}} incident wave energy at the time of anchor ice formation. <b>Slush</b> <b>ice</b> is mm-sized, unconsolidated, mobile ice. <b>Slush</b> <b>ice</b> consists primarily of floating accumulations of frazil ice crystals, although anchor ice and NIC ice are also incorporated into this mobile ice type. Sand is incorporated into <b>slush</b> <b>ice</b> directly from the bed or water column and by transfer of sediment-laden anchor ice and NIC ice to the <b>slush</b> <b>ice</b> zone. Combined ice sampling, video records and drifter returns show that there is a net transport of <b>slush</b> <b>ice</b> and sand to the south and offshore along the southwestern Lake Michigan coast. This study shows that annual ice formation in southern Lake Michigan is removing sand from the sediment-starved nearshore zone...|$|E

40|$|An ice {{storage is}} one of the ways of {{effective}} use of thermal energy. So, studies on a <b>slush</b> <b>ice</b> as thermal storage material have been done. We have also been studying on a suspension (<b>slush</b> <b>ice)</b> made of oil-water mixture with cooling and stirring. From our study result, it was found that a kind of additive having amino group (-NH_ 2) and silanol group (-SiOH) was essential to make the suspension with high IPF without adhesion of ice to a cooling wall. Moreover, formed ices in the suspension were dispersed and granular state and ices did not stick each other. In the present paper, we carried out experiments to clarify the characteristics of the suspension formation process. From the experimental results, {{it was found that the}} substance in the suspension was not ice but a compound consisting of ice and additive by a thermal analysis of fusion of the substance.

40|$|The ice drift buoy DRIVA {{is tested}} {{for the first time}} in the {{environment}} for which it was designed. The communication with the buoy via satellite phone is working well. Temperatures could be read during the entire test period, and except from an unexplained loss of GPS data during 20 days, the GPS position was transmitted as expected. The rotary encoders did not function properly during the campaign. A sea ice drift algorithm is validated against the buoy data using ten image pairs acquired by the C‐band SAR satellite ENVISAT. The accuracy of the algorithm decreases with time and highest accuracy is achieved with the first three image pairs. For the first image pair, the computed translation differs by only 160 m from the translation measured by the buoy, which is a good result considering the pixel resolution of approximately 150 m. The root mean square error of the algorithm for the first three image pairs is 5 % for the ice speed and 4 degrees for the direction of the ice. The decreasing accuracy can be related to an increase of melting during the campaign. The sea ice is very dynamic during the period, making the images very different. Large ice floes break into smaller pieces after a short time. As the ice floes melt and get smaller, rotation increases, and the shapes of the ice floes are not preserved. It appears that the buoy floats within a streak of <b>slush</b> <b>ice</b> during the last days of the time period.

40|$|James et al. (2006) have {{reviewed}} {{previous studies}} {{related to the}} chilling of fresh products. The goal of chilling is always to limit the growth of pathogenic and food spoilage microorganisms. It has been proved that chilling reduces the number of both types of microorganisms {{on the surface of}} fresh products. In Europe dry air is the preferred chilling method. This method is believed to have clear microbiological advantages but James et al. (2006) show that the published data do not support this belief and direct contact chilling methods might even have larger microbiological advantages. However, in a continuous production line, chlorination or other additive is needed to prevent accumulation of micro-organisms. This is not acceptable in Europe. The rate of chilling has some influence on the taste, texture and appearance of the fresh product. Very rapid chilling will generally lead to robust structure while very slow chilling can produce soft texture. Pederson (1979) has compared the costs of different chilling methods in Denmark. When only energy costs were considered, the cost of a countercurrent water immersion chilling system was one fifth that of an air chilling method. <b>Slush</b> <b>ice</b> is often preferred in immersion systems since cooling takes place without freezing damage of the product while the heat removal takes place at a low temperature. For 70 % <b>slush</b> <b>ice</b> content of the slurry, the cooling time is lowest while with 35 % <b>slush</b> <b>ice</b> the highest weight gain is attained (around 5 %). When air is used, short chilling times require low air temperatures and high air velocities. James et al. (2006) report for a specific product a chilling time (38 to 4 oC) 150 minutes with 0. 75 m/s and 1 oC, 60 minutes with 4. 1 m/s and - 7 oC, and 17 minutes with - 40 oC. Short chilling times impose low air temperatures and so low evaporating temperatures and high energy consumption of the primary refrigeration cycle. In this paper the immersion of fresh products in melting carbon dioxide hydrate crystals, produced at + 8 oC and 30 bar, is proposed for rapid chilling of fresh products. First the chilling time of a specific fresh product from 30 to 4 oC making use of a â€œshock freezer (2 m/s air velocity, air at - 10 oC) and applying a slurry of CO 2 hydrate crystals is compared. Also the effect of these two methods on the weight loss of the product is compared. Then the chilling of chicken products making use of the proposed method is experimentally verified. Also the microbiologic contamination of samples chilled using high speed dry air, immersion in melting water and immersion in CO 2 hydrate slurry are compared. Finally the economic advantages and practical applicability of the proposed method are evaluated...|$|E

Bidirectional reflectances of the refrozen <b>slush</b> <b>ice</b> measured show a spectral dependence and change significantly with solar zenith angle. Considerable variation occurs at each view angle and among view angles throughout the day. Although diurnal reflectance patterns were similar in both bands, magnitudes varied greatly, being highest in the visible and lowest in the near-infrared region.

Myocardial protection consisted of administration of the St. Thomas&#x 2032; Hospital cardioplegic solution, topical <b>slushed</b> <b>ice</b> and systemic hypothermia (28 degrees C- 30 degrees C). The patients were categorised into: group A (n= 30), who received antegrade cardioplegia alone, and group B (n= 30), who received antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia. With {{the exception of the}} total dose of cardioplegic solution (&#x 2032;p&#x 2032;= 0. 02), {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups. Cardiac function was assessed before and after the patient was weaned from the cardio-pulmonary bypass. There was a significant increase in the right atrial pressure and a significant decrease in the mean arterial pressure from the baseline (&#x 2032;p&#x 2032;< 0. 05), 10 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass in group A. All patients in-group B had a spontaneous return to sinus rhythm after release of the aortic cross clamp, whereas 3 patients in group A required defibrillation to restore sinus rhythm. Intra aortic balloon pump support was necessary in 4 patients in group A, as against 1 patient in group B to terminate the cardiopulmonary bypass. The clinical outcome was similar in both groups.

40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} effect of {{viscosity}} on axial force in the esophagus during primary peristalsis using a newly validated impedance-based axial force recording technique. METHODS: A probe able to simultaneously measure both axial force and manometry was positioned above the lower esophageal sphincter. Potable tap water and three thickened fluids were used to create boluses of different viscosities. Water has a viscosity of 1 mPa 7;s. The three thickened fluids were made with different concentrations of Clinutren Instant thickener. The viscous fluids were in appearance comparable to pudding (2 kPa 7;s), yogurt (6 kPa 7;s) and <b>slush</b> <b>ice</b> (10 kPa 7;s). Six healthy volunteers swallowed 5 and 10 mL of boluses multiple times. RESULTS: The pressure amplitude did not increase with the bolus viscosity nor with the bolus volume whereas the axial force increased marginally with bolus volume (0. 1 > P > 0. 05). Both techniques showed that contraction duration increased with bolus viscosity (P < 0. 01). Association was found between axial force and pressure but the association became weaker with increasing viscosity. The pressure amplitude did not increase with the viscosity or bolus volume whereas the axial force increased marginally with the bolus size. CONCLUSION: This indicates a discrepancy between the physiological functions that can be recorded with axial force measurements and pressure measurements...|$|E

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 This study {{investigated}} {{the ability of a}} portable hand-held electronic nose (EN) to detect spoilage of whole and canned Alaska pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) using ethanol as a spoilage indicator for canned salmon. Fish held in seawater (14 °C) and in <b>slush</b> <b>ice</b> (1 °C) were sampled and canned at various intervals of time up to 3 and 16 days of storage, respectively. The EN measured volatile compounds emanating from the gill and belly cavity of whole fish, in conjunction with sensory and microbial analyses.

In addition, static headspace gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was used to quantify ethanol concentrations in canned products. The EN sniffed the belly cavity and distinguished the degrees of spoilage of whole pink salmon with 85 - 92 % correct classification for both storage temperatures. However, the EN was unable to distinguish the spoilage in canned salmon, regardless of original storage temperature. Ethanol concentrations in salmon cans produced from fish stored at 14 °C correlated well with results from sensory evaluations, but this correlation was not observed for fish stored at 1 °C.
