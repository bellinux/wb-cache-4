To design, construct, install and calibrate a wind tunnel. 3. To develop procedures for air velocity measurement followed by a comprehensive programme of aerodvnamic data collection and data analysis for a variety of conditions. The major research findings were:- a) The literature in the subject is inadequate. There is a particular need for a much greater understanding of the aerodynamics of the suction flow field. b) The discrepancies between the experimentally observed centre-line velocities and those predicted by conventional formulae are unacceptably large. c) There was little agreement between theoretically calculated and observed velocities in the suction zone of captor hoods. d) Improved empirical formulae for the prediction of centre-line velocity applicable to the classical geometrically shaped suction openings and the flanged condition could be (and were) derived. Further analysis of data revealed that: - i) Point velocity is directly proportional to the suction. flow rate and the ratio of the point velocity to the average face velocity is constant. ii) Both shape, and size of the <b>suction</b> <b>opening</b> are significant factors as the coordinates of their points govern the extent of the effect of the suction flow field. iii) The hypothetical ellipsoidal potential function and hyperbolic streamlines were found experimentally to be correct. iv) The effect of guide plates depends on the size, shape and the angle of fitting. The effect was to very approximately double the suction velocity but the exact effect is difficult to predict. v) The axially symmetric openings produce practically symmetric flow fields. Similarity of connection pieces between the <b>suction</b> <b>opening</b> and the main duct in each case is essential in order to induce a similar suction flow field.

Single openings in planar substrates seem to be intriguing simple solutions for these problems, but due to the low rate of formation of whole-cell configurations we discarded this approach. Single openings are not suited for both attracting cells to the opening by suction and forming gigaseals with subsequent membrane rupture. To settle the three tasks with a mechanical microstructure we developed the so-called CYTOCENTERING technique to apply to suspended cells the same operation sequence as in conventional patch clamping.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide some {{fundamental}} understanding for the design of industrial hollow fiber pervaporation membrane module. Inner skin hollow fiber pervaporation membrane modules were fabricated by a dynamic negative pressure layer-by-layer (LbL) technique. The influences of dynamic negative pressure and recycling velocity of polyelectrolyte solutions on the formation of non-porous selective layer were firstly investigated using mini-modules during the dynamic assembly process. Since none of reported works dealt with the effects of packing density of hollow fiber module, pilot-scale modules (diameter x length = 1 in. x 20 cm) were therefore prepared by filling different amounts of hollow fibers into a membrane shell. The experimental results show that the higher packing density of 500 m(2) /m(3) rendered both total flux and selectivity to decrease significantly. As for a I m long module that has been commonly used in industry, further investigations were conducted using a 1 -m long hollow fiber module. The vacuum drop along the axial direction of hollow fibers was noted, especially near to the vacuum <b>suction</b> <b>opening.</b> Despite of this, the relatively high and stable selectivity could be obtained even the fiber length increased to 1 m.

40|$|A {{technique}} is described {{for use of}} liposuction-assisted removal of even large lipomas through small skin incisions. (OTOLARYNGOL HEAD NECK SURG 1995;I 13 : 401 - 3,) Cervicofacial lipomas are common tumors that can cause significant cosmetic deformities {{in the head and}} neck. Conventional surgical approaches require incisions almost the length of the tumor and may require dissection around nerves and vessels, trad-ing improved contour for a long scar. We have used liposuction-assisted surgery in five patients to re-move cervicofacial lipomas up to 20 cm in size through very small incisions. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE Tumor size and location are assessed, and incision placement is planned so that the incision falls in a preexisting skin crease or anatomic interface bound-ary and allows access to the entire tumor (Fig. 1). The margins of the tumor are established by ballot-ment, and the edges are marked with a surgical marking pen. The lipoma and surrounding area, including deep to the lipoma, are infiltrated with a local anesthetic. A small (1. 5 to 3. 0 cm) incision is made at the periphery of the mass, camouflaged as possible in a skin crease or anatomic boundary.

40|$|Ejectors {{have been}} widely used in many {{applications}} such as water desalination, steam turbine power generation, refrigeration systems, and chemical plants. The advantage of an ejector system lies in its extremely reliable and stable operation due to the complete absence of moving parts. However, the performance depends on a number of factors, among which the flow channel configuration/arrangement is very critical. A comprehensive study mainly focusing on the sensitivity of performance on the geometric arrangement was conducted in this paper to improve an existing thermal compressor performance in a steam evaporator. The performance is measured by the suction (secondary) flow rate of the primary steam jet from a low-pressure vapor plenum. Numerical simulation is employed to investigate the thermal-flow behavior. It is observed that any downstream resistance will seriously impede the suction flow rate. In addition, the suction rate is found {{to be sensitive to the}} location of the jet exit, and there is an optimum location where the jet should be issued. A well-contoured diffuser can increase the suction rate significantly. However, the size of <b>suction</b> <b>opening</b> to the plenum is less important, and a contoured annular passage to guide the entrained flow shows little effect on the overall performance.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Suction feeding is {{recognized}} as the dominant mode of aquatic prey capture in fishes. While much {{work has been done}} identifying motor pattern var-iations of this behavior among diverse groups of actinopterygian fishes, many ray-finned groups are still not represented. Further, the substantial amount of inherent variation in electromyography makes much of the pioneering work of suction feed-ing motor patterns in several basal groups insufficient for evolutionary compari-sons. Robust evolutionary comparisons have identified conserved qualitative traits in the order of muscle activation during <b>suction</b> feeding (jaw <b>opening.</b> buccal cavity expansion. jaw closing). However, quantitative traits of suction motor patterns (i. e., burst durations and relative onset times) have changed over evolu-tionary time among actinopterygian fishes. Finally, new motor pattern evidence is presented from a previously neglected group, the Elopomorpha. The results suggest that future investigations of the muscles influencing lateral expansion of the mouth cavity and head anatomy may provide valuable new insights into the evolution of suction feeding motor patterns in ray-finned fishes.

40|$|A {{clinically}} intuitive physiologic controller {{is desired}} {{to improve the}} interaction between implantable rotary blood pumps and the cardiovascular system. This controller should restore the Starling mechanism of the heart, thus preventing overpumping and underpumping scenarios plaguing their implementation. A linear Starling-like controller for pump flow which emulated {{the response of the}} natural left ventricle (LV) to changes in preload was then derived using pump flow pulsatility as the feedback variable. The controller could also adapt the control line gradient to accommodate longer-term changes in cardiovascular parameters, most importantly LV contractility which caused flow pulsatility to move outside predefined limits. To justify the choice of flow pulsatility, four different pulsatility measures (pump flow, speed, current, and pump head pressure) were investigated as possible surrogates for LV stroke work. Simulations using a validated numerical model were used to examine the relationships between LV stroke work and these measures. All were approximately linear (r 2 (mean ± SD) = 0. 989 ± 0. 013, n = 30) between the limits of ventricular <b>suction</b> and <b>opening</b> of the aortic valve. After aortic valve opening, the four measures differed greatly in sensitivity to further increases in LV stroke work. Pump flow pulsatility showed more correspondence with changes in LV stroke work before and after opening of the aortic valve and was least affected by changes in the LV and right ventricular (RV) contractility, blood volume, peripheral vascular resistance, and heart rate. The system (flow pulsatility) response to primary changes in pump flow was then demonstrated to be appropriate for stable control of the circulation. As medical practitioners have an instinctive understanding of the Starling curve, which is central to the synchronization of LV and RV outputs, the intuitiveness of the proposed Starling-like controller will promote acceptance and enable rational integration into patterns of hemodynamic management.

40|$|The {{study the}} flow {{structure}} of tornado-like vortices {{and their impact}} over engineering structures is important due {{to the extent of}} tornado induced fatalities and damages observed each year in North America and around the world. In the present study, a numerical modeling approach inspired by the WindEEE Dome and the modified version of Ward’s Tornado Simulator has been developed. Using a full-scale numerical simulator, tornadoes of different intensities have been simulated for different swirl ratio values to study flow structures in comparison with previous studies. The effect of topographic features on the tornado-like vortex has been investigated for the first time. A new approach to quantify the changes in the tornadic wind field “speed-up” due to the topography has been developed. Once a confidence level is achieved on tornado flow structure under flat terrain and with topographic features scenarios, the interaction of the tornado-like vortex with bluff bodies is modeled. For this purpose, both low- and high rise buildings are considered. More emphasis has been given to the low-rise building and hence it has been further investigated for stationary and translating tornado under sealed and opened conditions. The open condition represents breaching on the building envelope due to, for example, wind born debris. Selected experiments have been conducted at WindEEE Dome for validating the numerical model. For the low-rise building, the overall pressure distribution along the wall surfaces of the body are dominated by the external tornado pressure field (suction) near the ground surface that develops due to the high angular momentum of the flow. For large tornado size with respect to the study buildings, the Cp on the entire building surface resemble the near ground suction irrespective of the shape. Thus, indicating that at the tornado center, the effect of the interaction of tornado with the bluff body is minimum. This is not the case for smaller tornadoes. The tornado building interaction effects (i. e. aerodynamics) start to be dominant as the tornado center is located far away from the study building. A comparison with ABL flow reveals that the Cp magnitudes and their distributions are quite different for tornado center and core radius locations. For offset position of tornado center with respect to the building, the tornado induced Cp value starts to resemble the ones from ABL-flow case. For <b>opening</b> case, ground <b>suction</b> dominates the overall pressure distribution for all the locations of tornado. As a result, irrespective of the number and location of <b>openings,</b> <b>suction</b> is higher {{both inside and outside the}} bluff-body at tornado center and it decreases as tornado moves away from the bluff-body (core radius and outside core regions). For the high-rise building, an additional vertical pressure variation, not seen in the shorter buildings, as the tornado vortex interacts with the building has been observed. The CFD study has been validated in comparison with WindEEE experiments. These studies are expected to contribute to addressing the lack of tornadic aerodynamic characteristics. In the long run this will contribute in enhancing the resiliency of the built environment and safety of our communities...|$|R
