25|$|The console has custom {{components}} codeveloped by the Nintendo Research & Engineering Department {{and other}} manufacturers, all combined into a unified <b>system</b> <b>on</b> <b>chip.</b> The main processor (CPU) is a ARM11 MPCore-based dual-core processor manufactured at 45nm. One processor core {{is dedicated to}} games and applications, while the other core is exclusive to the operating system, enabling multitasking and background tasks. These tasks are handled seamlessly in the background during gameplay or while the system is in sleep mode. The system also contains a single-core ARM9 processor, enabling backward compatibility with Nintendo DS games. The graphics processor (GPU) is developed by Digital Media Professionals, and consists of a semi-custom PICA200 processor.|$|E
25|$|The {{company was}} founded in November 1990 as Advanced RISC Machines Ltd and {{structured}} as {{a joint venture between}} Acorn Computers, Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) and VLSI Technology. The new company intended to further the development of the Acorn RISC Machine processor, which was originally used in the Acorn Archimedes and had been selected by Apple for their Newton project. Its first profitable year was 1993. The company's Silicon Valley and Tokyo offices were opened in 1994. Arm invested in Palmchip Corporation in 1997 to provide <b>system</b> <b>on</b> <b>chip</b> platforms and to enter into the disk drive market. In 1998 the Company changed its name from Advanced RISC Machines Ltd to ARM Ltd. The Company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange and NASDAQ in 1998 and by February 1999, Apple's shareholding had fallen to 14.8%.|$|E

500|$|The {{specifications}} of {{the phone}} was first leaked out by an HTC insider {{towards the end of}} 2012 that had claimed the device was then called [...] "Opera UL" [...] with a 1280x720 screen, and an Adreno 305 graphics processor with the Snapdragon 1.4 GHz CPU <b>system</b> <b>on</b> <b>chip,</b> which was later known to match the actual specifications of the final device.|$|E
500|$|The [...] uses a <b>system</b> <b>on</b> <b>chip</b> (SoC), {{called the}} Apple A6. The SoC {{comprises}} a 1.3GHz dual-core processor, 1GB of RAM and a tri-core PowerVR SGX543MP4 running at 266MHz. The 's operating memory (LPDDR2-1066 eDRAM) was doubled, from 512 MB to 1 GB. Storage capacities available are fixed at 16, 32 or 64 GB, {{the same as}} the 4S; plug-in memory cards are not supported. The two color options are black (with black glass and slate-colored metal trim), and white (with white ceramic and silver-colored metal trim); again the same color options (though differently implemented) as its predecessor the 4S had. The iPhone 5 retains the 8 megapixel back camera on the iPhone 4S, but has improved low-light performance, and has a 40% faster photo capture than its predecessors, while having a purple hue when a strong source of light is present in the photograph. The front camera, which is accessible through the FaceTime and camera app has a lower resolution, at 1.2 megapixels. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery with a charge capacity of 1440mAh is built in and cannot be replaced by the user; it is rated at ≤225hours of standby time and ≤8hours of talk time. There are three separate models of the phone available: one supporting CDMA and two GSM versions.

This modeling approach supports a fully static scheduling strategy, based on the analysis of the combinational dependency graph. Our static scheduling algorithm has been implemented in the SystemCASS simulator, and provides speed-up of one order of magnitude versus the standard event-driven SystemC simulation engine.

40|$|International audienceIntegration of {{hardware}} accelerators in <b>System</b> <b>on</b> <b>Chips</b> is often complex.

This instruction set is used to program a dedicated controler, which commands the accelerator's execution and data transfer with minimal CPU intervention. The resulting architecture is flexible, extensible, and can be easily integrated in <b>System</b> <b>on</b> <b>Chips.</b> Adding new accelerators is also made easier. Implementation of the architecture on different FPGA resources show very low footprint and a very small impact on attainable performance.
