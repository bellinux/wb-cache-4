50|$|Chris played {{soccer in}} high school at Monsignor McClancy Memorial High School. He is the school's all-time leading goal scorer. For all of his goal-scoring accomplishments, Christopher was named as team Most Valuable Player after his freshman, junior, and senior years. Throughout his high school career, the Crusaders won the Brooklyn-Queens Championship four times, losing only one game along the way (a <b>span</b> that <b>saw</b> the team go undefeated in 56 league games). In Christopher's sophomore season, the team {{advanced}} to the City Championship game. In his junior season, the Crusaders once again progressed to the City Championship game, this time defeating Salesian 2-0, a season that saw the Crusaders outscore their opponents by a staggering 100-17 goals with a school best 14-2-1 record. In his senior year, the team compiled a record of 16-3, falling in a penalty shootout to Saint Joseph's by the Sea in Staten Island. Christopher received recognition as a City All-Star first team member from the C.H.S.A.A. coaches all four years {{as well as by}} the Daily News, Newsday, and various local newspapers.|$|R
40|$|In {{a remarkably}} short time, Google, Inc. {{has grown from}} two people working in a rented garage to a {{pervasive}} Internet force. Much of Google 2 ̆ 7 s unprecedented success stems from online advertising sales which employ behavioral advertising techniques-techniques that track consumer behavior [...] thereby increasing relevance and decreasing the cost of reaching a targeted audience. In the same <b>span</b> that <b>saw</b> Google 2 ̆ 7 s inception and explosive online dominance, the Federal Trade Commission has struggled to define not only the privacy issues involved in online behavioral advertising, but also the practice of behavioral advertising itself. Freed from the restraints of comprehensive federal laws and restrictive federal regulations, Google and its ilk have taken innovative liberties with the collection and use of consumer information. While the Federal Trade Commission ponders the subtleties of online behavioral advertising, mountains of data about consumers are being gathered and manipulated like never before, scarcely subject to legislative or regulatory privacy protections.

Spillane shares this record of nine All-Star wins with Kilkenny hurlers Henry Shefflin, D.J. Carey and Eddie Keher (although Keher's record is made up of 5 All-Stars and 4 Cú Chulainn Awards). His All-Star accolades were presented as part of a six-in-a-row from 1976 until 1981 and a three-in-a-row from 1984 until 1986. Spillane is also one of only a handful of players to have won senior Munster winners' medals in each of three separate decades.|$|R
50|$|With the {{domination}} of the Andong Kims, the era of *sedo politics* or in-law rule began. The formidable in-law lineage monopolized the vital positions in government, holding sway over the political scene, and intervening in the succession of the throne. These kings had no monarchic authority and could not rule over the government. The yangban of other families, overwhelmed by the power exercised by the royal in-laws, could not speak out. As the power was concentrated {{in the hands of}} the royal in-law lineage, there was disorder in the governing process and corruption became rampant. Large sums were offered in bribes to the powerful lineages to obtain positions with nominally high rank. Even the low-ranking posts were bought and sold. This period, which <b>spanned</b> 60 years, <b>saw</b> the manifestation of both severe poverty among the Korean population and ceaseless rebellions in various parts of the country.|$|R
50|$|Caledor's son {{ascended to}} the throne, taking the title Caledor II. Unlike his father, Caledor II was arrogant and foolish. When the Dark Elves sought to inflame the Asur-Dwarf relations, Caledor II's arrogance only worsened the situation. The Dark Elves began raiding Dwarf trade caravans, {{disguised}} as High Elves,but when the Dwarves demanded an explanation and recompense for their loss, Caledor arrogantly {{replied that he}} did not answer demands but granted pleas and send the Dwarf emissaries away with nothing. The Dwarf High King, Gotrek Starbreaker, replied he made no plea to elf, man or god and demanded twice the weregeld price for the implied insult. Outraged by this, Caledor had the Dwarf emissary sent back with his beard shaved off: the ultimate insult in Dwarven culture. This atrocity sparked off the War of the Beard, a millennia <b>spanning</b> conflict that <b>saw</b> the empires of the Elves and Dwarves crumble into ruins.|$|R
40|$|According to FAO - ISPM No 15, in {{international}} trade wood packaging material {{on the basis of}} sawn timber requires to be heat-treated to avoid spreading of harmful organisms. "Heat-treatment" means a minimum core temperature of the wood of 56 ° C for a minimum of 30 minutes. ISPM No 15 does not define moisture content and therefore does not include rules for the drying process. Practitioners report that fresh sapwood, after having undergone a pure heat treatment without any kind of drying, shows a great affinity to fungi (mould and blue stain). Even though the infestation does not affect the strength properties of the wood, it must be considered as an optical and a sanitary problem. An environmentally friendly, cheap and easy to use technique for temporary anti-mould protection of heat-treated wood is needed to bridge the time <b>span</b> between <b>sawing,</b> heat treatment and air or kiln drying. Results derived from laboratory experiments have shown that the heat-treatment affects the elution of the lipid components within pine sapwood. While searching for alternatives to conventional preservation methods, different environmentally compliant agents (particularly aqueous solutions containing sodium- and potassium carbonate) were found to inhibit the germination of mould and blue stain fungi spores on wood packaging material surfaces in a temporary manner. Besides their effectiveness, the usage of these agents to achieving the temporary protection (e. g. for a couple of weeks) is economically feasible and easily applicable in industrial practice. However, drying (either naturally or technically) is indispensable to avoid fungal hazard on the long run. A combination of temporary treatment immediately after sawing followed by a drying-process (long lasting protection) seems to be the most effective method to protect ISPM No 15 treated wood packaging material against moul...|$|R
40|$|We {{have carried}} out a {{multiphase}} analysis of samples from ODP Site 177 - 1092, Meteor Rise, subantarctic South Atlantic. Samples were analyzed for ice-rafted debris (IRD [see Table T 1]) and stable isotopes from benthic foraminifera [see Murphy et al., 2002, doi: 10. 1016 /S 0031 - 0182 (01) 00495 - 3]. Both analyses were performed on the same samples. Additional work was performed to identify the paleomagnetic stratigraphy. The analyzed samples {{range in age from}} about 2. 6 (?) Ma to 4. 6 Ma, a time <b>span</b> that <b>saw</b> considerable global warmth, but witnessed overall global refrigeration and the transition to truly bipolar glaciations. IRD arrived frequently during the Early and early Late Pliocene, but only as 'background rafting' (occasional grains per sample). The first identifiable IRD above background rafting is associated with marine isotope stage (MIS) KM 4 (~ 3. 18 Ma). Successive IRD peaks become larger, the same pattern as noted at nearby Site 114 - 704. A very large peak {{near the top of the}} record, approximately 2. 8 Ma, is considered to represent a hiatus. Peaks below 51. 3 meters composite depth (mcd) coincide with positive excursions of the oxygen isotopic record, and with negative excursions of the carbon isotopic curve, a pattern also noted at Site 114 - 704. However, the reasonably large IRD peak at 51 mcd (tentatively identified with MIS G 11) coincides with a positive excursion on the carbon isotopic curve and negative excursion on the oxygen isotopic curve. This relationship suggests a northern hemisphere interglacial, rising sea level, destabilization of the Antarctic margin, and delivery of Antarctic icebergs to the Southern Ocean. Such a mechanism has recently been suggested by Kanfoush et al. (2000, doi: 10. 1126 /science. 288. 5472. 1815) for latest Pleistocene stadial/interstadial oscillations. Here we suggest that such a mechanism may have been in place on glacial/interglacial time scales as early as the Late Pliocene...|$|R
5000|$|During his stint with The Monkees, Nesmith had {{accumulated}} an extensive back-catalogue of songs {{which had not}} been heard by anyone.

50|$|In {{the first}} two games of the series, the winner scored the first three goals. In game one, Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur won his 100th career playoff game, only the second netminder after Patrick Roy to do so, as New Jersey won 3-2. The Panthers' 4-2 win in game two was their first playoff win since April 17, 1997, and ended a streak of nine {{straight}} defeats in a 15-year <b>span.</b> game three <b>saw</b> both starting goaltenders pulled from the game. Florida's Jose Theodore surrendered three goals in the first period before being replaced by Scott Clemmensen, appearing in only his second playoff game. Brodeur was then pulled after the Panthers rallied to tie the game in the second period en route to 4-3 win. This was the first time since game one of the 2006 Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Carolina Hurricanes that Brodeur was pulled in a postseason game, which coincidentally marked Clemmensen's playoff debut. Brodeur bounced back in game four and broke another one of Roy's records with his 24th career playoff shutout, as the Devils beat the Panthers, 4-0. But Theodore responded with his second career postseason shutout, as the Panthers took a 3-2 series lead with a 3-0 victory in game five. The Devils then tied the series with Travis Zajac's winning goal 5:39 into the overtime of game six. New Jersey's Adam Henrique then scored two goals in game seven, including the series-winning goal 3:47 into double overtime, to defeat Florida, 3-2.|$|R
25|$|After {{a seven-year}} hiatus Wales once again played England and {{continued}} to do so annually throughout the 1920s, apart from in 1924. Because of the long hiatus {{a large proportion of}} players competing in the 1921 match were earning their first cap for the team. The first game at Leeds saw Wales lose 35–9 in front of 13,000. A further 13,000 saw the 1921–22 Kangaroo touring side play Wales in December 1921, this time in Pontypridd. Like the first time these nations played each other, Australia narrowly defeated the Welsh, the final score being 16–21. In 1922 Wales took part in the first international rugby league match to be played in London. England beat Wales 12–7 in Herne Hill but just 3,000 people turned up to watch, one of the lowest attendances to ever watch a Wales match. After four more matches against England in various Rugby League strongholds in Northern England, the Dragons once again played in Wales. Two matches were played in 1926 in Pontypridd, the same year that a Pontypridd domestic side joined the English leagues, although they disbanded a year later. The first match saw finished Wales 22–30 England with a record 23,000 in attendance. The second match saw Wales comfortably beat the touring New Zealand 34–8. Three more matches against England were played including one in November 1928 played in Cardiff. It was in the 1920s that Jim Sullivan, one of three Welsh players to be enrolled into the Rugby League Hall Of Fame, started rising through the ranks at Wigan. A career <b>spanning</b> 25 years <b>saw</b> him play many times for Wales picking up 26 caps, a record that was only beaten in 2010 by Ian Watson. He also represented Great Britain 25 times and Glamorgan & Monmouthshire 12 times.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{has been}} {{conducted}} at Ovako Bar {{for a period of}} 10 weeks and is the final part of the bachelor's programme in mechanical engineering. Ovako Bar is a business unit of the European steel concern Ovako which specializes in the manufacturing of engineering steel for applications in various fields of mechanical engineering. The company wants to improve profitability of their sawing centre by reducing the consumption of saw blades and increase productivity at one of their sawing machines. In the current situation the company uses disposable blades which are discarded either when a tool break occurs or when the quality requirements are no longer met for the outgoing material. A literature review was conducted in which various factors affecting the life <b>span</b> of the <b>saw</b> blades were analyzed after their impact on the outcome in which two factors was selected to be used for a design of experiments. The factors selected were feed per tooth and cutting speed in which a total of four experiments were conducted and finally the results showed that the interaction effect was the decisive factor for the outcome. To investigate the tool wear that had arisen a scanning electron microscope was used where a few teeth on each blade were studied for any damages. The conclusions that could be drawn from the experiment is that a high feed rate must be combined with a high cutting speed for best result which {{has to do with the}} fact that a higher feed requires a greater heat generation for the best chip formation. The same applies for the lower feed rate which must be combined with a lower cutting speed because a higher cutting speed causes a dominating wear on the clearance face...|$|R
40|$|The {{premise of}} this study is that an {{understanding}} of catalysts and impacts of social and economic change in the Los Angeles Metro Green Line study corridor and an analysis of current planning policies can help identify how future planning policies may generate more ideal and positive outcomes for the study corridor. This study evaluated the conditions within the transit corridor with four selected station areas defined by a one-mile radius from each station. The stations that make up the transit corridor are along the Los Angeles Metro Green Line that runs east west between Redondo Beach and Norwalk. A mile radius buffer was chosen to fully capture the spacing between the stations linearly and use that to define the corridor’s primary area of influence. This study evaluated the changes in demographic composition, housing affordability, transportation affordability and job accessibility within the Metro Green Line corridor between the year 2000 and 2010. Trends in the corridor revealed that over a ten-year <b>span,</b> the corridor <b>saw</b> shifts in demographic composition, growth in job and housing densities and increases in the cost of housing. Over the ten years, the corridor has not yet developed to the standards of a location efficient environment. This study recommends that protection of vulnerable populations such as the high proportion of renter-occupied housing units is important because they are more likely to make up core transit riders that need public transportation. Preserving and building affordable housing near transit would enable households to save money on both transportation and housing expenditures and can work towards making the corridor more affordable. By understanding the three main variables in the context of social equity, a decision-maker can avoid the potential of negative gentrification, displacement, and promote economic viability in the corridor...|$|R
