40|$|ABSTRACT An {{evaluation}} of <b>supplementary</b> natural <b>ventilation</b> in curtain-sided housing using ridge ventilation was conducted. A well-insulated broiler house was constructed and {{divided into two}} halves, one with a continuous 1. 2 -m wide open ridge. Four broiler trials were conducted over three summers. Neither the thermal environment nor the bird performance was affected signifi-cantly by the supplemental ventilation provided by the open ridge. Modern poultry houses with well-insulated roofs result in minimal temperature differentials, thus potentially providing a lower stack ventilation rate.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{investigation}} of the performance of car seat fabrics in terms of physiological comfort of sitting, specifi cally their water vapour resistance and air permeability. The current work presents an alternative approach to increasing the effectiveness of car seat fabrics through a combination of newly designed middle layer with forced convection achieved by a <b>supplementary</b> suction <b>ventilation</b> device. The <b>supplementary</b> device was designed to measure water vapour permeability by means of the sweating guarded hot plate (SGHP) system. It consists of two parts: a frame to grip a tested sample for measurements within the SGHP system and two suction ventilators which are arranged {{at one end of the}} mentioned frame in order to provide suction into the tested fabric plane during the SGHP test. The results of this investigation show that water vapour transport is increased by approximately 20 % compared to the standard way of measurement by means of SGHP because of forced air flow in the plane of ribbed – channelled structure of the car seat middle layer. The findings of this study have a number of important implications for future practice. The combination of a car seat cover with channelled structure and forced air fl ow improves physiological comfort of sitting which is a key issue for both drivers and manufacturers. The suggested device for forced air flow convection in the plane of a car seat fabric has not yet been part of an actual car seat, however it is possible to use its principles in a smart car seat prototype...|$|R

The train was brought to a controlled stop adjacent to a door leading to the service tunnel, at 21:58, about [...] from the French portal. After stopping, power from the overhead line was lost and smoke filled the tunnel; crew members could not see the service tunnel doors. Smoke began to enter the coach and the crew and passengers suffered from smoke inhalation. The <b>supplementary</b> <b>ventilation</b> system was turned on and ran for seven minutes with the blades set incorrectly.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the incidence and {{risk factors of}} retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm Chinese infants. Design: Retrospective review. Methods: Medical records were reviewed for all neonates screened for ROP between January 2007 and December 2012 in Hong Kong. Screening was offered to VLBW (= 1500 g) and/or preterm (gestation, = 32 weeks) neonates using the Royal College of Ophthalmologists ROP guideline and the International Classification of ROP by 3 pediatric ophthalmologists. Maternal and neonatal covariates were analyzed using univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses for both ROP and type 1 ROP. Results: Of the 513 screened infants, the mean gestational age (GA) was 30. 0 ± 2. 5 weeks and the mean birth weight (BW) was 1232. 6 ± 325. 2 g. The incidence of ROP and type 1 ROP was 18. 5 % and 3. 7 %, respectively. In univariate analysis, a lighter BW, lower GA, blood transfusion, patent ductus arteriosus, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, postnatal hypotension, inotropes usage, low Apgar scores, sepsis, mechanical <b>ventilation,</b> <b>supplementary</b> oxygen use, respiratory distress syndrome, anemia, surfactant use, and bronchopulmonary dysplasiawere {{found to be associated}} with the development of both ROP and type 1 ROP (P < 0. 05). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, BW, GA, and intraventricular hemorrhage were significant risk factors for ROP. Preeclampsia and eclampsia were the only protective factors for ROP development on multivariable logistic regression analysis (P = 0. 02). Conclusions: In VLBW preterm Chinese infants, lower GA, lighter BW, and intraventricular hemorrhage were significant risk factors for ROP, whereas preeclampsia and eclampsia were protective.
