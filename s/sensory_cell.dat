50|$|To detect water movement, many {{invertebrates}} have <b>sensory</b> <b>cells</b> with cilia {{that project}} {{from the body}} surface and make direct contact with surrounding water.

In addition to the ampullary organs and knollenorgans typically present in the epidermis of the adult fish, three other sensory organs were found. These were two different types of tuberous organs (types A and B) and promormyromasts; all of which have the typical characteristics of electroreceptor organs. Each organ has a single <b>sensory</b> <b>cell,</b> The <b>sensory</b> <b>cell</b> of the promormyromast is surrounded by a number of accessory cells. The free apical area of the <b>sensory</b> <b>cell</b> and the accessory cells protrude into an intraepidermal cavity. The <b>sensory</b> <b>cell</b> of the two types of tuberous organs is isolated in a cavity lined by epidermal cells which have long microvilli. The outer margin of the <b>sensory</b> <b>cell</b> also bears many microvilli and its base sits on a platform of accessory cells. An unmyelinated nerve crosses through the accessory cells and contacts the <b>sensory</b> <b>cell</b> in the promormyromast and the type B tuberous organ.

40|$|A new {{mechanoreceptor}} organ, the coronal organ, in {{the oral}} siphon of some ascidians belonging to the order Pleurogona has recently been described. In contrast to the known mechanoreceptor organs of ascidian atrium that consist of sensory neurons sending their own axons to the cerebral ganglion, coronal <b>sensory</b> <b>cells</b> are secondary mechanoreceptors, i. e., axonless cells forming afferent and efferent synapses with neurites of neurons located in the ganglion. Moreover, coronal cells exhibit an apical apparatus composed of a cilium accompanied or flanked by rod-like microvilli (stereovilli). Because of the resemblance of these cells to vertebrate hair cells, their ectodermal origin and location in a linear array bordering the bases of the oral tentacles and velum, the coronal organ has been proposed as a homologue to the vertebrate acousticolateralis system. Here we describe the morphology of the coronal organs of six ascidians belonging to the suborders Phlebobranchia and Aplousobranchia (order Enterogona). The <b>sensory</b> <b>cells</b> are ciliated, lack typical stereovilli, and at their bases form synapses with neurites. In two species, the <b>sensory</b> <b>cells</b> are accompanied by large cells involved in synthesis and secretion of protein. We hypothesize that the coronal organ with its secondary <b>sensory</b> <b>cells</b> represents a plesiomorphic feature of ascidians. We compare the coronal organ with other chordate sensory organs formed of secondary <b>sensory</b> <b>cells,</b> i. e., the ventral lip receptors of appendicularians, the oral secondary <b>sensory</b> <b>cells</b> of cephalochordates, and the acousticolateralis system of vertebrates, and we discuss their homologies {{at different levels of}} organization...|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} larval electroreceptors, type A and B, are {{described}} in the epidermis {{of the head of}} larvae of three mormyrid species, Campylomormyrus cassaicus, Mormyrus rume proboscirostris and Pollimyrus isidori, bred in captivity. In each of these electroreceptor organs, a single <b>sensory</b> <b>cell</b> is found inside an intraepidermal cavity, sitting on a platform of accessory cells. The cavity is filled with microvilli originating both from the <b>sensory</b> <b>cell</b> and from the epidermal covering cells lining the intraepidermal cavity. These two types of tuberous larval electroreceptors differ in their distribution in the epidermis of the head, in the composition of their accessory cells, and by their innervation. The innervation found in type B organs is similar to that already described for electroreceptors of adult mormyrids. The sensorineural junction is composed of primary afferent terminal boutons, which contact the base of the <b>sensory</b> <b>cell.</b> Opposite each terminal bouton, a ribbon-like synaptic bar surrounded by vesicles is found in the cytoplasm of the <b>sensory</b> <b>cell.</b> In contrast, the base of the <b>sensory</b> <b>cell</b> in type A larval electroreceptors is not contacted by nervous terminal boutons, but instead forms closed appositions with specialized prolongations of accessory cells of the platform.

40|$|Promormyromasts {{were found}} in the {{epidermis}} of the head of the larvae of five species of mormyrids bred in captivity. The promormyromast is a larval electroreceptor belonging to the specific lateral line system. In 12 -day-old larvae this electroreceptor is characterized by a single <b>sensory</b> <b>cell</b> and two types of accessory cells. One type of accessory cell has dark cytoplasm, few microtubules, and contacts the <b>sensory</b> <b>cell</b> directly, whereas a second type has pale cytoplasm, many microtubules, and forms an outer layer not directly in contact with the <b>sensory</b> <b>cell.</b> This second type is referred to as a long pyriform accessory cell. This assembly of cells is situated below an intraepidermal cavity filled with acid polysaccharides. The bordering epidermal cells extend microvilli into the intraepidermal cavity. The apexes of the <b>sensory</b> <b>cell,</b> and of the two types of accessory cells, also open into the intraepidermal cavity but bear no microvilli. The promormyromast is innervated by an unmyelinated sensory nerve fiber passing through the basal membrane, which then splits into several branches between the accessory cells. These branches contact the periphery of the <b>sensory</b> <b>cell</b> with terminal boutons. At the site of each contact a ribbon-like structure surrounded by vesicles is present in the cytoplasm of the <b>sensory</b> <b>cell.</b> In older larvae of Campylomormyrus cassaicus, membrane foldings develop at the periphery of the pyriform accessory cells and accessory cell staining properties change just before transformation to become a mormyromast.

In the present study, we asked whether facilitation must invariably enhance transmission at all terminals of a neuron or whether facilitation can instead occur at {{one set of}} terminals without also occurring at other terminals of the same cell. To examine this question, we compared effects of local application of serotonin and of connective stimulation on transmission at central and peripheral branches of single <b>sensory</b> <b>cells.</b> We found that heterosynaptic facilitation can be branch-specific and can occur at either central or peripheral synapses independently. We also found that siphon <b>sensory</b> <b>cells</b> exhibit homosynaptic post-tetanic potentiation, allowing us to compare effects of hetero- and homosynaptic facilitation in the same cells. By contrast to heterosynaptic facilitation, homosynaptic facilitation occurs concomitantly at both central and peripheral synapses of siphon <b>sensory</b> <b>cells.</b> Thus, while both heterosynaptic and homosynaptic facilitation involve increases in transmitter release from sensory neuron terminals, heterosynaptic facilitation provides a greater specificity and flexibility in the modification of synaptic connections...|$|R
