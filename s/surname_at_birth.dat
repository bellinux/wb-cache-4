40|$|The {{policy to}} provide {{oral polio vaccine}} (OPV) <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> was {{introduced}} in low-income countries to increase coverage. The effect of OPV <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> on overall child mortality was never studied. During a trial of vitamin A supplementation (VAS) <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> in Guinea-Bissau, OPV was not available during several periods. We took advantage of this "natural experiment" to test the effect on mortality of receiving OPV <b>at</b> <b>birth.</b> Between 2002 and 2004, the VAS trial randomised normal-birth-weight infants to 50, 000 IU VAS or placebo administered with BCG. Provision of OPV <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> {{was not part of}} the trial, but we noted whether the infants received OPV or not. OPV was missing during several periods in 2004. We used Cox proportional hazards models to compute mortality rate ratios (MRR) of children who had received or not received OPV <b>at</b> <b>birth.</b> A total of 962 (22. 1 %) of the 4345 enrolled children did not receive OPV at birth; 179 children died within the first year of life. Missing OPV <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> was associated with a tendency for decreased mortality (adjusted MRR = 0. 69 (95 % CI = 0. 46 - 1. 03)), the effect being similar among recipients of VAS and placebo. There was a highly significant interaction between OPV <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> and sex (p = 0. 006). Not receiving OPV <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> was associated with a weak tendency for increased mortality in girls (1. 14 (0. 70 - 1. 89)) but significantly decreased mortality in boys (0. 35 (0. 18 - 0. 71)). In our study OPV <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> had a sex-differential effect on mortality. Poliovirus is almost eradicated and OPV <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> contributes little to herd immunity. A randomised study of the effect of OPV <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> on overall mortality in both sexes is warranted...|$|R

40|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that the sex ratio <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> is partially determined by environmental and social factors. The modern change in those factors serves as {{an explanation for the}} secular decline in sex ratio <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> in most of the industrialized countries. This article is the reexamination of the results from my previous communication in which no trend in sex ratio <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> was established for the Croatian data from 1946 to 2007. The data for the years 2008 to 2011 were added, which didn’t result with the detection of a significant change in sex ratio <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> by the regression analysis or by the Box-Jenkins time series analysis. Although the numerous factors associated with the decline in sex ratio <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> did occur during the studied period (e. g. increased exposure to the environmental pollution through food, air and water, the rise of the obesity and diabetes incidence, the economic crisis etc.), it appears that none of them made the measurable impact on sex ratio <b>at</b> <b>birth.</b> Also, the possible marginally significant decline in sex ratio <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> could be the result of a high sex ratio <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> immediately after the World War II. The results of this study caution against rapid generalization of the factors found to influence the sex ratio <b>at</b> <b>birth</b> in the epidemiological and clinical studies on the population level data...|$|R
