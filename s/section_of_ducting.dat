40|$|The {{mitigation}} {{of effects}} {{of gas and}} dust explosions within industrial equipment is effective if venting the combustion products to safe location. The presence <b>of</b> relief <b>duct</b> is however likely to increase the severity of the explosion with respect to equipment vented to open atmosphere, due to secondary explosions occurring in the initial <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> <b>duct,</b> frictional drag and inertia of the gas column, acoustic and Helmholtz oscillations. The weights of these phenomena on explosion enhancement in terms of peak pressure and rate of pressure rise are still uncertain. As a consequence, appropriate design of duct-venting configuration is still a matter of debate. We recently found that the main phenomenon among those cited is the burn-up occurring in the initial <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>duct,</b> which leads to the backflow from the duct towards the protected vented equipment, thus restricting the effective vent section and turbulizing the flame within the combustion chamber. Starting from this result, we have identified dimensionless numbers which quantifies the burn-up effects and then we identified engineering correlations for the appropriate design <b>of</b> relief <b>section</b> in the presence <b>of</b> <b>duct.</b> © TÜBİTAK...|$|R

30|$|Constructal {{theory is}} a novel thought for nature and society [11 – 17]. It tries to explain {{phenomena}} based on optimization, or natural selection in biological terms. One of its viewpoints is that two flow mechanisms are better than one [18]. This is what one sees naturally in river basins, lung structure, and the percolation threshold effect [19]. Our previous studies have proved that the blade configuration of nanofluids {{is much better than}} the dispersed configuration for the two kinds of disk-shaped heat conduction systems with different boundary conditions [20, 21]. It is believed that the continuous nanoparticle blades with higher thermal conductivity serve as the second conduction mechanism, and its optimized cooperation with the base fluid of low thermal conductivity leads to the much better performance. In this study, the blade configuration of nanofluids is considered in detail by studying the influence of the shapes of high-conductivity blades in two kinds of building blocks of the total blade-configured heat conduction systems. This study is inspired by the need for the optimization <b>of</b> the cross <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>duct</b> for minimum flow resistance [11]. By treating heat as a flow medium flowing in blades, one can also find the optimal shape for the blades, which offers minimum thermal resistance.|$|R

A total of 20 patients underwent frozen <b>section</b> diagnosis <b>of</b> bile <b>duct</b> margin for resection of gallbladder and bile duct carcinoma. Main outcome. Diagnosis of frozen and permanent <b>section</b> <b>of</b> bile <b>duct</b> margin, and local recurrence. Results. The permanent diagnosis was identical in 15 patients but changed in 5 (from positive to negative in 3 and from negative to positive in 2). The reasons for these changes were overdiagnosis (mucosal lesions {{in two and}} mesenchymal components in another) and new recognition of malignant cells on permanent section in the other two. In seven patients with a positive bile duct margin by permanent histology, mucosal spread was evident in two and involvement of the subepithelial layer was present in the other five.

Frozen section and permanent diagnoses <b>of</b> the bile <b>duct</b> margin in gallbladder and bile duct carcinoma may be inconsistent in 25 % of patients due to overdiagnosis <b>of</b> frozen <b>section</b> or new recognition of cancer cells by permanent histology.

25|$|Fanno flow {{refers to}} {{adiabatic}} flow through a constant area duct where {{the effect of}} friction is considered.

For this model, the duct area remains constant, the flow {{is assumed to be}} steady and one-dimensional, and no mass is added within the duct. The Fanno flow model is considered an irreversible process due to viscous effects. The viscous friction causes the flow properties to change along the duct.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the performance of bar-silencers in ventilation ducts, with and without mean flow. The goal of which was to determine a product which could be used on its own or in conjunction with current traditional methods for induct sound attenuation. A literature review was conducted on induct sound attenuation and bar-silencers. A test facility was established in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Canterbury. Modifications were made to an existing fan and duct rig to align it with ISO 7235 (1991) - Measurement procedures for ducted silencers - Insertion loss, flow noise and total pressure loss. A number of bar-silencers were tested in the test facility to determine both their insertion loss and pressure loss characteristics. Bar-silencers which varied in thickness, (such as, triangular shaped silencers) were confirmed to have an insertion loss across a greater range of frequencies, but lower peak absorption than ducting lined on two sides. It was found that the bar-silencers would not be a cost effective method of sound attenuation on their own, due to less effective noise absorption, higher material costs and higher pressure losses, than traditionally lined <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> <b>ducting.</b> However, the bar-silencers could be used in conjunction with traditional methods of sound attenuation to increase the attenuation or in low flow velocity ventilation exits where pressure losses are reduced...|$|R
