5|$|In {{another version}} of the story, the king adopted all of the {{children}} of his sister Rangorimanana. He then devised a test to determine which one would succeed him. He requested his messengers to bring the children a package including lemons, meat, honey, rice, milk and a reed, and to note which child took the reed and <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> central pillar of the house; this child was Rakotomavo.|$|E

5|$|Uttanka {{then saw}} two {{beautiful}} women weaving with {{white and black}} threads on a wheel fixed on the wall. The wheel had twelve spokes and was being turned by six young people. A horse with a rider <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> wheel. Uttanka praised {{the functioning of the}} weaving process, the rider and the horse, and equated the rider to Indra. Pleased with this praise, the rider asked Uttanka to state in what way he could help him. Uttanka requested that he be given the power to bring the snakes under his control. The rider then instructed Uttanka to blow {{at the back of the}} horse. Uttanka did as suggested. Then flames emerged from all parts of the horse's body and filled the realm of the serpents with fire and smoke. The terrified Takshaka came out of hiding and gave up the earrings to Uttanka.|$|E
25|$|Competing hotels {{opened up}} nearby {{over the next}} several decades. The Kaaterskill Hotel, founded by a disgruntled Mountain House guest, was located near the summit of South Mountain. The more modest Laurel House <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> top of Kaaterskill Falls. Several hoteliers {{attempted}} to make a similar success on the summit of Overlook Mountain.|$|E
25|$|Another temple <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> circus Flaminius, vowed by consul Marcus Aemilius Lepidus in 187BC {{during the}} war against the Ligures and {{dedicated}} by himself as censor in 179 on December 23. It was connected by a porch with a temple of Fortuna, perhaps that of Fortuna Equestris.

25|$|To {{decorate}} his own {{summer home}} on Lake Delton, Newman transported several sculptures and concrete blocks he saved {{from the rubble}} of Midway Gardens (1913, Chicago, Illinois; demolished 1929), the last of Frank Lloyd Wright's Prairie Style buildings, which had <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> Lake Michigan shoreline in downtown Chicago. Newman's company had been hired in 1929 to demolish the structure. Years later, when Wright heard of {{the survival of the}} sculptures and blocks, he purchased them and they remained with his estate. As recently as 1999, a block was found buried on the property of Newman's old summer home on Lake Delton and was donated to the Chicago Historical Society.|$|E
25|$|The other {{settlers}} {{rushed into}} the cabin as the raiding warriors surrounded the house. They {{shut the door and}} aimed their weapons through cracks in the walls. Two of the men <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> doorway with their weapons, and Hodges' weapon came into contact with Girty's chest causing him, and his group, to retreat into the woods. Young Dimmick, anxious to the point of begging to leave, was then dispatched to Hennepin by horseback for help. The men at the cabin expected Dimmick to be shot as soon as he rode off, but he crossed the open prairie unscathed. Dimmick made the 16 mile (25.7km) journey and arrived in Hennepin to report the attack.|$|E
500|$|The rent {{had risen}} to £300 a year, and the landlords refused to sell the freehold, to renew the lease, which was nearing expiry, or to allow {{extensions}} {{to be made to}} the ground, which was by then surrounded by tightly-packed housing. The directors estimated that remaining at Muntz Street was losing the club as much as £2000 a year in revenue; the March 1906 cup-tie against Newcastle United produced receipts of £900 from a crowd restricted to 25,000, with [...] "probably 60,000 people anxious to attend". Club director Harry Morris identified a site three-quartersof a mile(1km) nearer the city centre where a new ground could be built, on wet, sloping wasteland where a disused brickworks <b>stood,</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> railway and St Andrew's Church. Within twelve months of a 21-year lease being signed, the new ground, which became known as St Andrew's, was ready for use.|$|E

500|$|The ancient Native American {{village of}} Capoose {{used to be}} {{within a mile of}} the mouth of Roaring Brook. An Indian war path used to cross the stream near what is now Scranton. The Slocum family {{constructed}} a gristmill on the stream in 1780 and Philip Abbott constructed a gristmill on the stream in 1788. Ebenezer Slocum and Benjamin Slocum built a forge along the stream in 1799 or 1800. Rolling mills also operated along it in the 19th century. The first bridge in Madison Township was constructed over the stream in 1830 by Nathaniel Carter. A Mr. Rupert constructed the first sawmill in Moscow on Roaring Brook in 1831. An iron works industry known as the Slocum Brothers Mill was constructed on Roaring Brook [...] upstream of its mouth in 1838. It struggled at first, but by 1846 managed to get a contract to produce iron T rails for the New York and Lake Erie Railroad. The furnaces of the Lackawanna Coal and Iron Company once <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> stream. A sawmill was constructed over the stream in Covington Township in 1840 and the first gristmill in that township was built on Roaring Brook in the northeastern part of that township in 1864. The first bridge over the stream was built in 1859. In 1870, the Scranton family constructed a mansion on the stream.|$|E
500|$|Before Monitor was {{put into}} dry dock for repairs President Lincoln, Navy Secretary Fox, various {{officials}} {{and a few of}} Worden's close friends arrived to ceremoniously review the vessel and pay respect to the crew and former commander Worden, who after a long and partial recovery arrived for the occasion. Entire regiments were also directed to come by the naval yard and review the ship and honor the crew. Monitors crew assembled on deck in formation with their officers in front, while Lincoln, Fox and other guests <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> turret. When Worden, with part of his face blacked from the wounds he received at Hampton Roads, came aboard, the heavy guns in the navy yard were fired in [...] President Lincoln came forward and greeted Worden and then introduced him to some of the others. After Lincoln's formal greeting the crew swarmed around Worden and embraced and shook hands with their former commander and thanked God for his recovery and return. Worden called each of them by name and spoke friendly to and complimented each of them personally. When order was restored the President gave a short speech about Worden's career. At Fox's request, Worden gave a speech to the gathering about his voyage from New York to Hampton Roads, the trials they were faced with along the way and of the great battle between Monitor and Virginia, while paying tribute to many of the officers and men involved. In closing he gave special thanks to Ericsson, Lincoln, Welles and all who made construction of Monitor possible.|$|E
