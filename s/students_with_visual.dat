Daí ter resultado o tema em estudo. Este estudo teve como objetivo {{principal}} identificar as barreiras que se colocam à aluna com deficiência visual e promover a sua inclusão na aula de matemática, criando oportunidades de acesso à participação no processo de ensino-aprendizagem. Trata-se de uma abordagem interpretativa, concretizada através do estudo de caso de uma aluna com deficiência visual e que procura responder às seguintes questões: Que dificuldades apresenta a aluna no desenvolvimento de valores/atitudes, capacidades/aptidões e conhecimentos? Como é que a aluna transmite as suas ideias matemáticas aos colegas e aos professores? Qual a contribuição de diferentes materiais e recursos didáticos no desenvolvimento e inclusão da aluna na sala de aula? O estudo baseou-se na análise: do Projeto Educativo da Escola; do dossiê de turma; do Programa Educativo Individual da aluna com deficiência visual; dos registos escritos pela aluna relativamente às tarefas e suas reflexões no diário; das notas de campo registadas pela investigadora no seu diário; dos documentos que advieram das transcrições das entrevistas semiestruturadas realizadas, ao professor de Educação Especial da aluna, ao professor de MACS e à própria aluna. Este estudo identifica um conjunto de dificuldades que a aluna com deficiência visual revelou na aula de matemática e apresenta algumas formas de as ultrapassar. Concluiu-se que para fazer face a essas dificuldades revelou-se essencial: a diversidade de tarefas propostas, a adequação dos materiais didáticos utilizados pela aluna, o desenvolvimento da comunicação e interação aluna-professores e aluna-colegas.

50|$|According to Michael J.Bina, the 12th {{president}} of MSB since 2008, public schools cannot fully support <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments {{because they have}} not learned or been trained how to. He states that despite the government’s efforts to make all children regardless of disability feel welcomed and accepted in public schools, “schools for the blind and visually impaired continue to be relevant… The services of these institutions help visually handicapped students to gain access in normal educational settings. They provide the necessary support for attaining skills that would complement the ones they learn from public schools.” Therefore to accomplish this standard that President Bina has set for schools that intend to help the visually impaired, the Maryland School for the Blind, along with many other institutions for the blind, incorporate the Expanded Core Curriculum. Of course these schools teach subjects that are taught in public schools, such as history, math, English, etc, but they are known as the core curriculum. The Expanded Core Curriculum’s aim is to teach students the life skills that will help them become proficient in their core curriculum and eventually live well off on their own. The ECC covers nine aspects that the students need to learn: compensatory or functional academic skills, orientation and mobility, social interaction skills, independent living skills, recreation and leisure skills, career education, use of assistive technology, sensory efficiency skills, and self-determination. Each aspect focuses on a specific set of skills. The orientation and mobility aspect, for example, teaches students how to get around private and public environments - their own home, restaurants, parks, etc., special techniques - trailing, techniques on self-defense, cane skills, etc., and how to travel in unfamiliar or dangerous terrain - revolving doors, iced sidewalks, etc. Then there is the social interaction skills. It may sound unnecessary to those without any visual impairment, but the seeing learn social cues, such as gestures, the meaning of certain facial expressions, body positions, and movements, through what they see and hear. They are able to associate reactions and expressions to certain concepts even if they are not doing so intentionally. Understandably, the visually impaired cannot learn social skills through this method of sight. Therefore, the ECC carefully teaches the {{blind and visually impaired students}} numerous socials skills so that they can interact with those around them whether they be blind or not.|$|E
