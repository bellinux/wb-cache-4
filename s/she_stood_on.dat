The Russo-Georgian War between Georgia and Russia erupted on the opening day of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Both President Bush and Prime Minister Putin were attending the Olympics at that time and spoke together about the conflict at a luncheon hosted by Chinese president Hu Jintao. When Nino Salukvadze of Georgia won the bronze medal in the 10metre air pistol competition, <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> the medal podium with Natalia Paderina, a Russian shooter who had won the silver. In what became a much-publicised event from the Beijing Games, Salukvadze and Paderina embraced on the podium after the ceremony had ended.|$|E
500|$|The {{flammability}} of the crinoline {{was widely}} reported. It is estimated that, {{during the late}} 1850s and late 1860s in England, about 3,000 women were killed in crinoline-related fires. One such incident, {{the death of a}} 14-year-old kitchenmaid called Margaret Davey was reported in The Times on 13 February 1863. Her dress, [...] "distended by a crinoline," [...] ignited as <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> the fender of the fireplace to reach some spoons on the mantelpiece, and she {{died as a result of}} extensive burns. The Deputy-Coroner, commenting that he was [...] "astonished to think that the mortality from such a fashion was not brought more conspicuously under the notice of the Registrar-General," [...] passed a verdict of [...] "Accidental death by fire, caused through crinoline." [...] A similar case was reported later that year, when 16-year-old Emma Musson died after a piece of burning coke rolled from the kitchen fire to ignite her crinoline. A month later, on 8 December 1863, a serious fire at the Church of the Company of Jesus in Santiago, Chile, killed between two and three thousand people. The severity of the death toll is credited in part to the large amounts of flammable fabric that made up the women's crinoline dresses. Two notable victims of crinoline fires were William Wilde's illegitimate daughters, Emily and Mary, who died in November 1871 of burns sustained after their evening gowns caught fire. Slaveykov reported in 1864 that over the last 14 years, at least 39,927 women worldwide had died in crinoline-related fires, opining that it was more deadly than the practice of sati or the auto-da-fé. Although flame-retardant fabrics were available, these were thought unattractive and were unpopular.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the sixth}} book, , Artemis' mother Angeline Fowl becomes gravely ill {{with a rare}} fairy disease called Spelltropy. Artemis {{attempts}} to cure her with his remaining magic, but it only serves to worsen her condition. The only cure for Spelltropy {{is found in the}} brain fluid of the Silky Sifaka Lemur, the last of which Artemis sold in a business deal when he was ten years old, resulting in the extinction of the species. To get Holly to help him, Artemis falsely accuses her of exposing his mother to magic, which led to her developing the disease. Holly believes Artemis and, ridden with guilt, accompanies him to the past to rescue the last lemur from his younger self. After several misadventures, Artemis recovers the lemur but learns that his mother's illness was a ruse plotted by Opal Koboi, who wanted the lemur's brain fluid to increase her own magical powers. Artemis ruins Opal's plans by bringing his ten-year-old self into the present and fooling Opal, saving his mother in the process. Opal flees, but returns again as Artemis appears to take the lemur and fly off the manor's grounds in his Cessna. She chases him, following the thermal read of the lemur and slowly destroying the plane until it crashes on the shoreline. At the crash site, the two stand off until she discovers that the lemur is actually only a decoy, fitted with a thermal read to trick Opal. Before she can further injure Artemis, he shoots the boulder she's on, and it is shown that it was in fact the shell of a kraken <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>on,</b> built up with gases that exploded with the pressure of Artemis's shot. The LEP team later informs Artemis that Opal's body was not recovered from the rubble. As a result of Opal meddling with her mind, Angeline Fowl learns of Artemis' contact with the People, and she asks Artemis to tell her the truth. Artemis' 10-year-old self has his mind wiped by Nº1, but retains a brief memory of the existence of fairies, ...|$|E
