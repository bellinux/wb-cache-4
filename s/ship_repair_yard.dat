40|$|This article {{considers}} the Anglo-French imperial {{relationship in the}} Asian littoral 1852 – 1870, revealing {{the ways in which}} Britain afforded France the use of key elements of maritime steam infrastructure in Asia, including coal supplies, coal storage depots, and <b>ship</b> <b>repair</b> <b>yards.</b> This facilitated the projection of French naval and military force to Asia. It also facilitated French colonization of Southeast Asia. This also left France dependent upon Britain for important parts of its maritime infrastructure in Asia. This article explores the dynamic of competitive-collaboration between the two powers, arguing that both deepened their interdependence in Asian maritime infrastructure for wholly self-interested reasons (Britain forestalled the development of independent, coal-based French power in Asia and France used British port facilities to support the development of French colonial power in Asia). In this collaborative relationship, Britain remained the senior partner...|$|R

50|$|By 1871 the {{population}} of Barry was over 100, with 21 buildings, the new estate-owning Romilly family {{being involved in the}} buildup of the village but it remained a largely agricultural community. It grew when it was developed as a coal port in the 1880s. The coal trade was growing faster than the facilities at Tiger Bay in Cardiff ever could and so a group of colliery owners formed the Barry Railway Company and chose to build the docks at Barry. Work commenced in 1884 and the first dock basin was opened in 1889 to be followed by two other docks and extensive port installations. The Barry Railway brought coal down from the South Wales Valleys to the new docks whose trade grew from one million tons in the first year, to over nine million tons by 1903. The port was crowded with ships and had flourishing <b>ship</b> <b>repair</b> <b>yards,</b> cold stores, flour mills and an ice factory.
