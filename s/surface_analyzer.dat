Following are the system requirements of Attack <b>Surface</b> <b>Analyzer</b> (from the official download page): ...|$|E
50|$|Attack <b>Surface</b> <b>Analyzer</b> {{can compare}} two scan data (generated by itself on two {{different}} scans) and generate a report which can then be viewed in the HTML format. It is also possible to run the scans on one system and then generate on another system using the same tool. This is good for Windows Vista Clients {{because it is not}} possible to generate report using the current version of Attack <b>Surface</b> <b>Analyzer</b> on Windows Vista. In such a case, Attack <b>Surface</b> <b>Analyzer</b> can be used to run scans on the Windows Vista Client, transfer the scan result files to a computer running Windows 7 and then generate and browse the report on the Windows 7 based computer.|$|E
50|$|Attack <b>Surface</b> <b>Analyzer</b> list {{two types}} of scans namely {{baseline}} scan and product scan. In strict technical terms both the scans are same. The difference between them is logical, not technical.|$|E
40|$|Instrument, {{consisting}} of isolator, differentiator, absolute value circuit, and integrator, uses output signal from <b>surface</b> texture <b>analyzer</b> profile-amplifier to calculate surface roughness slope. Calculations provide accurate, instantaneous {{value of the}} slope. Instrument is inexpensive and applicable to any commerical <b>surface</b> texture <b>analyzer...</b>|$|R
50|$|NARICT's {{laboratories}} contain {{analytical equipment}} such as GCMS, AAS, LCMS, BET <b>surface</b> area <b>analyzer,</b> DTGA, SEM, FTIR and HPLC.|$|R
30|$|The BET {{specific}} {{surface area of}} the samples was measured by a multipoint N 2 adsorption–desorption method at liquid N 2 temperature (77  K) with a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 <b>surface</b> area <b>analyzer.</b> Samples were out-gassed under vacuum to remove the physisorbed water immediately before analysis.|$|R
50|$|It {{was this}} problem which made Microsoft create an {{application}} with which developers could analyze the changes {{made to the}} Windows Attack Surface. It has at first {{been used by the}} developers at Microsoft. Later, on January 18, 2011, a beta version (version 5.1.3.0) of a tool named Attack <b>Surface</b> <b>Analyzer</b> was released in public for the testers and IT administrators. Attack <b>Surface</b> <b>Analyzer</b> can compare two scan data of a system called the baseline scan and product scan. Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of software are available for Windows Vista and Windows 7 (and respective Server editions). There is no news about a Windows XP version being released.|$|E
50|$|Attack <b>Surface</b> <b>Analyzer</b> {{is a tool}} {{created for}} the {{analysis}} of changes made to the attack surface of the operating systems since Windows Vista and beyond. It is a tool recommended by Microsoft in its SDL guidelines in the verification stage of the development.|$|E
50|$|Attack Surface of Windows Operating System {{concerns}} {{various parts}} of the Operating System. It would have been difficult for anyone to understand the report if all of the changes were listed in serial order. Attack <b>Surface</b> <b>Analyzer</b> makes it easy for the user to browse through the report by listing the threats in categories and providing a Table of contents in an HTML page.|$|E
30|$|After {{degassing}} at 100  °C {{under vacuum}} for 2  h, the nitrogen adsorption isotherms at liquid nitrogen {{temperature in the}} charcoal powder were recorded using a <b>surface</b> area <b>analyzer</b> NOVA 1200 (Quantachrome Co.). The specific surface area of charcoal was calculated using the isotherms obtained based on a BET multi-points method.|$|R
30|$|Thermogravimetric {{analysis}} (TGA) {{was conducted}} using a TGA instrument (STA 449 F 3) with a heating rate of 10  °C min− 1 from room temperature to 800  °C. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area, pore size, and volume were {{measured by the}} nitrogen adsorption method using a <b>surface</b> area <b>analyzer</b> (NOVA 2200 e).|$|R
30|$|The {{physicochemical}} {{properties of}} eggshell powder (ash content, bulk density, particle density, moisture, pH, pHzpc, porosity, surface area, moisture content and carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen) were checked. In this study, <b>surface</b> area <b>analyzer</b> (Model: Nova- 2200 e, Quantachrome corporation, Boynton Beach, USA) was operated {{to analyze the}} specific surface area of the EGP.|$|R
50|$|The above list is a {{comprehensive}} set of elements which are both possible as well as important elements which can be changes when new software is installed on the system. While some software might change only a few elements in the list, some other can change a few more and different elements on the system. Attack <b>Surface</b> <b>Analyzer</b> combines all of them {{so that it is}} easier to analyze all parts.|$|E
50|$|While Attack <b>Surface</b> <b>Analyzer</b> {{can tell}} you the changes for sure, in some cases, it will also {{be able to tell you}} that a {{particular}} change in the configuration is causing a threat. As of now, the tool does not enlist the threats in all the categories (or parts of the Operating System) it scans but only a few, the most noticeable of which are the issues in services configurations, File system ACLs and issues related to the processes running on the system.|$|E
50|$|Attack <b>Surface</b> <b>Analyzer</b> {{is all in}} one {{tool for}} {{analysis}} of changes made to the {{various parts of the}} attack surface of Windows 6 series Operating System (includes Windows Vista and Windows 7). Using this one tool, you can analyze the changes made to the Registry, File permissions, Windows IIS Server, GAC assemblies and a lot more can be done. According to Microsoft, it is the same tool in use by the engineers of the security team at Microsoft to analyze the effects of software installation on the Windows Operating System.|$|E
30|$|The BET {{specific}} surface {{areas of the}} synthesized nanocomposite were determined by nitrogen adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature on a Sibata SA- 1100 <b>surface</b> area <b>analyzer.</b> X-ray diffraction measurements were recorded by a Philips PW 1840 diffractometer with Cu–Kα radiation, scan rate 0.02 2 θ/s and within a range of 2 θ of 10 °– 80 ° at room temperature.|$|R
30|$|The BET {{surface area}} and the pore size {{distribution}} of the calcined nanopowders were determined by a BET <b>surface</b> area <b>analyzer</b> (Belsorp-mini 00165 series, BEL Japan, Inc., Osaka, Japan) using N 2 as the adsorptive gas. The morphology changes of the composite powders with different Al 2 O 3 contents were examined by a SE-SEM (Wega/Tescan, TESCAN, a.s., Brno, Czech Republic).|$|R
40|$|The {{study done}} {{was to develop}} {{strategies}} that utilize the measurement and analytical capabilities of a Semitest <b>Surface</b> Charge <b>Analyzer</b> (SCA 2000) and monitor contamination caused during certain processes and in furnaces in an IC fab. A significant drop in average minority carrier lifetime {{and an increase in}} fixed oxide charge was observed. Counterdoping was also observed in one of the furnaces...|$|R
50|$|According to the Microsoft SDL Team, {{they did}} not have an all in one tool for {{checking}} the changes made to the attack surface of Windows Operating System before Attack <b>Surface</b> <b>Analyzer</b> was developed. It was a problem to check and verify the effects of various software installations on the system way back since Windows Server 2003 was being developed. Back then they had to use multiple tools for every type of change made to the attack surface. It was a painful process when they had to check for everything again and again and using multiple tools.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{the scan}} run which the user will run to {{generate}} the data on the initial system. This data is then compared with the product scan. After running the baseline scan, the product whose effect on the attack surface of the Operating System is to be checked is installed. The installation changes the system configuration (possibly) by installing services, changing firewall rules, installing new [...]NET assemblies and so on. Baseline scan is a logical scan run by the user using Attack <b>Surface</b> <b>Analyzer</b> which generates the file containing {{the configuration of the}} system before this software is installed.|$|E
50|$|Product scan {{signifies the}} state of the system after the ‘product’ was installed. In this context, the product is the {{software}} whose effects on the system upon installation are to be checked. To generate a report, two scans are required in minimum. The product scan would capture the changes made to the system by the installation of the software product under testing. The scan data generated in this scan is compared with the baseline scan data to find the changes made to the system configurations on different points. It is worth a note that more than one system state can be captured using Attack <b>Surface</b> <b>Analyzer</b> and any combination of them can be used for the report generation. However the ‘Baseline Scan’ should be the one which was taken before the other. The other can automatically be called as the product scan.|$|E
30|$|The {{characterization}} of the adsorbents includes estimation of various parameters such as proximate analysis (moisture content, volatile matter content and fixed carbon content), bulk density, BET surface area, SEM, porosity, and pH. The surface area of adsorbents was found by BET <b>surface</b> area <b>analyzer.</b> The pore structure of activated carbon was observed through SEM analysis. The porosity and pore volume was estimated using mercury porosimeter.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Phloroglucinol-resorcinol-formaldehyde organic aerogels(PRF) were {{prepared}} using phloroglucinol, resorcinol and formaldehyde in a sol-gel process, solvent replacement and drying at room temperature. The phloroglucinol-resorcinol-formaldehyde carbon aerogels(CPRF) {{were prepared}} by charring the PRF at high temperature {{under the aegis}} of helium flow. The microstructure of CPRF was characterized by infrared spectroscopy, specific <b>surface</b> area <b>analyzer</b> and scanning electron microscopy.

50|$|Every {{organization}} has its experts on various domains of security. There {{may be a}} case when a network security expert in an organization is {{not aware of the}} details and terminology of some other domain (say Windows Services). However, the two issues may be connected to each other. While it is not possible (and in some case not important) for the experts of two security expert teams to know everything about the terms in use by each other, it might be required in a few cases. A brief description (along with a link to technet library describing the term in detail) of all threats and changes to the attack surface are enlisted in the report generated by the Attack <b>Surface</b> <b>Analyzer.</b> While the brief description is usually enough for the experts, it might be needed in other cases. Microsoft has made it easy to find the right resource for the term rather than relying upon the web search engines.|$|E
50|$|Getting {{the list}} of threats to the system {{is a great thing}} when you have it from {{software}} released by Microsoft itself. After all, no one knows Windows better than Microsoft. With the improved concerns over security shown by Microsoft, {{it is important that the}} severity of a threat is also known to the IT team of an enterprise. Attack <b>Surface</b> <b>Analyzer</b> also shows the severity of the threat which it finds. However, it seems not to report the severity of each and every threat. Instead it shows the severity of the threat by its category. For example, the severity of threat caused by “Executables With Weak ACLs” (threat severity of level 1) is less than that caused by “Processes With Impersonation Tokens” (threat severity of level 2). It is surely a desirable feature to enlist the level of severity caused by each threat rather by the category to which it belongs. There however, is no news about when that might be available.|$|E
50|$|The alpha-scattering <b>surface</b> <b>analyzer</b> was {{designed}} to measure directly the abundances of the major elements of the lunar surface. The instrumentation consisted of six alpha sources (curium 242) collimated to irradiate a 100 mm diameter opening {{in the bottom of}} the instrument where the sample was located and two parallel but independent charged particle detector systems. One system, containing two sensors, detected the energy spectra of the alpha particles scattered from the lunar surface, and the other, containing four sensors, detected energy spectra of the protons produced via reactions (alpha and proton) in the surface material. Each detector assembly was connected to a pulse height analyzer. A digital electronics package, located in a compartment on the spacecraft, continuously telemetered signals to earth whenever the experiment was operating. The spectra contained quantitative information on all major elements in the samples except for hydrogen, helium, and lithium. The experiment provided 83 hours of high quality data during the first lunar day. During the second lunar day, 22 hours of data were accumulated. However, detector noise posed a problem in the reduction of data from this second day.|$|E
30|$|In this research, natural {{nanomaterials}} (CNC and NFC) {{were produced}} by using acid hydrolysis and mechanical techniques and also synthetics nanostructures (CNF and CNT) via CVD method. SEM, TEM, and XRD methods {{not only confirmed}} the crystalline nature of CNC and high graphitization structure of CNT but also determined the smaller diameter against NFC and CNF. Besides, EDX proved the high purity of the nanomaterials. Moreover, BET <b>surface</b> area <b>analyzer</b> found that synthetic nanomaterials had much more surface area than natural nanomaterials.|$|R
40|$|Mesoporous methyl-silica hybrid {{has been}} {{synthesized}} through sol-gel process, by using tetraethylorthosilicate and methyltriethoxysilane as precursors and tartaric acid as a template. The adsorbent {{was applied to}} study the adsorption of alizarin red-S. The preparation of methyl-silica hybrid was carried out at various mol ratios of precursors and tartaric acid concentration. The methyl-silica hybrid result was characterized by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and <b>surface</b> area <b>analyzer.</b> Adsorption experiment was conducted to study the effect of pH and Alizarin Red-S concentration on the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent. The adsorbed Alizarin Red-S was calculated from different of Alizarin Red-S concentration before and after adsorption based on the analysis with UV-Vis method. Characterization with Infrared Spectroscopy showed that methyl-silica hybrid has been successfully synthesized as indicated by appearance of characteristic functional group vibrations i. e Si-C, silanol (Si-OH) and siloksan (Si-O-Si). The X-ray diffraction data showed amorphous structure of methyl-silica Hybrid. The <b>Surface</b> Area <b>Analyzer</b> analysis data showed that the pore diameter and surface area of methyl-silica hybrid tended to increase as the template concentration increases. Adsorption study of methyl-silica hybrid showed that the adsorption decreased as the pH was increased. The optimum adsorption was obtained at pH= 2. 0 with the concentration of Alizarin Red-S of 70 mg/L.   Keywords: sol-gel, tartaric acid template, mesoporous, adsorptio...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The energy {{distribution}} of electrons in Townsend discharges in helium has been experimentally investigated {{in a direct}} fashion. A discharge is initiated between parallel plates of a small cell mounted {{at the center of}} a spherical retarding field energy analyzer. The anode of the cell is perforated and some electrons from the discharge enter the retarding field region. Pressures in the discharge cell are of the order of 1 torr and the pressure in the analyzer region is about 10 ⁻⁷ torr, so no significant alteration of the electron energy spectrum due to collisions takes place after electrons have left the discharge cell. The electron current reaching the collecting <b>surface</b> of the <b>analyzer</b> is measured as a function of retarding field strength. The usual perturbations due to probe measurements in the discharge itself are thus minimized. The interaction of electrons with the <b>surfaces</b> of the <b>analyzer</b> is considered, and the experimental data are corrected for the resulting electron reflection and secondary emission. A gold black <b>analyzer</b> <b>surface</b> exhibiting low total electron secondary emission coefficient is utilized. Experimental electron {{energy distribution}}s are compared with the theoretical calculations of Heylen and Lewis, and qualitative agreement is found for helium. The correction due to electron reflection and secondary emission is shown to be minor...|$|R
50|$|The alpha-scattering <b>surface</b> <b>analyzer</b> was {{designed}} to measure directly the abundances of the major elements of the lunar surface. The instrumentation consisted of an alpha source (curium 242) collimated to irradiate a 10 mm diameter opening {{in the bottom of}} the instrument where the sample was located and two parallel but independent charged particle detector systems. One system, containing two sensors, detected the energy spectra of the alpha particles scattered from the lunar surface, and the other, containing four sensors, detected energy spectra of the protons produced via reaction (alpha and proton) in the surface material. Each detector assembly was connected to a pulse height analyzer. A digital electronics package, located in a compartment on the spacecraft, continuously telemetered signals to earth whenever the experiment was operating. The spectra contained quantitative information on all major elements in the samples except for hydrogen, helium, and lithium. The experiment provided 46 hours of data accumulated from three lunar surface sample measurements. These measurements were of a portion of undisturbed local lunar surface, a lunar rock, and an extensively trenched area of the lunar surface. Data were obtained during the first and second lunar days, January 12 to 23, 1968, and February 13 to 21, 1968.|$|E
50|$|The alpha-scattering <b>surface</b> <b>analyzer</b> was {{designed}} to measure directly the abundances of the major elements of the lunar surface. The instrumentation consisted of an alpha source (curium 242) collimated to irradiate a 100 mm (3.94 in) diameter opening {{in the bottom of}} the instrument where the sample was located and two parallel but independent charged particle detector systems. One system, containing two sensors, detected the energy spectra of the alpha particles scattered from the lunar surface, and the other, containing four sensors, detected energy spectra of the protons produced via reactions (alpha and protons) in the surface material.

A digital electronics package, located in a compartment on the spacecraft, continuously telemetered signals to earth whenever the experiment was operating. The spectra contained quantitative information on all major elements in the samples except for hydrogen, helium, and lithium. Curium collected on the collimator films and was scattered by the gold plating on the inside bottom of the sensor head. This resulted in a gradually increasing background and reduction of the sensitivity technique for heavy elements. One proton detector was turned off during the second day of operation because of noise. A total of 43 hours of data was obtained from November 11 to November 24, 1967. The final data was obtained 4 hours after local sunset. However, after the spacecraft 'hopping' maneuver on November 17, 1967, the sensor head was upside down. Measurements were continued in order to obtain information on solar protons and cosmic rays. Therefore, data for the purpose of the chemical analysis of lunar surface material were obtained only during the first 30 hours of operation. During this period, 27 hours and 44 min of data were known to be noise free.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{endeavors to}} {{determine}} the feasibility of design metrics {{as a predictor of}} attack surface size by finding a positive correlation between one or more design metrics and an application’s attack surface measurement. An attack surface is the set of ways in which an adversary can enter a system and potentially cause damage. For an experimental setting, six open-source java-based projects were analyzed. For each project, the attack surface is assessed using Microsoft’s Attack <b>Surface</b> <b>Analyzer,</b> which takes a snapshot of a system state before and after the installation of product(s) and displays the changes to a number of key elements of the Windows attack surface.

The isotherms were obtained by monitoring the nitrogen adsorption/desorption data points at relative pressures ranging from 10 − 6 to 1  bar. These data were utilized to calculate the specific surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter of the different catalysts. At the initial stage, samples were degassed for 3  h at 300  °C.|$|R
