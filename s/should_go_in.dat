5|$|On 10July, {{the same}} day as Jane's proclamation, a letter from Mary Tudor arrived in London, saying that she was now queen and {{demanding}} the obedience of the Council. Mary was assembling her supporters in East Anglia; it was decided to take the field against her after some discussion over who <b>should</b> <b>go,</b> <b>in</b> which Jane made sure that her father should not. The Duke of Northumberland marched to Cambridge with his troops and passed a week that saw no action, until he heard on 20July that the Council in London had declared for Mary. Northumberland now proclaimed Mary Tudor himself at the market-place and was arrested the next morning. On 19July, a few hours before Queen Mary I's proclamation in London, the baptism of one of the Gentlemen Pensioners' children took place. Jane had agreed to be the godmother and wished the child's name to be Guildford. The Bishop of Winchester, Stephen Gardiner, who had been imprisoned in the Tower for five years, took great offence at this fact as he heard of it.|$|E

25|$|A Euclidean {{space is}} not {{technically}} a vector space {{but rather an}} affine space, on which a vector space acts by translations, or, conversely, a Euclidean vector is the difference (displacement) in an ordered pair of points, not a single point. Intuitively, the distinction says merely {{that there is no}} canonical choice of where the origin <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the space, because it can be translated anywhere. When a certain point is chosen, it can be declared the origin and subsequent calculations may ignore the difference between a point and its coordinate vector, as said above. See point–vector distinction for details.|$|E
25|$|Cricket has an {{anonymous}} letter giving further details following {{a meeting in}} Barbados on 17 April. A letter had been received from British Guiana indicating that Sproston was unable to accompany the team, although this eventually {{turned out not to}} be the case. A letter was received from Jamaica suggesting that Livingston <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> Cole's place, this being agreed to. Further a letter was received from Mr. Aucher Warner offering his services as captain in accordance with the West Indies Cricket Committee in London. This offer was accepted and Bowring the original captain was to tour as an ordinary member. The team given also excludes P.I. Cox who did eventually take part in the tour.|$|E
500|$|In February 2002, {{the trophy}} was renamed the FA Community Shield. The then-FA {{marketing}} director Paul Barber noted {{this was in}} order to reward the work of those contributing to the game, who go unnoticed: [...] "The {{most important thing is}} that the many good causes that have benefited from the shield in the past will continue to benefit from the Community Shield in the future." [...] The FA also intended to prevent any interference made by the Charity Commission into where money raised by the game <b>should</b> <b>go.</b> <b>In</b> April 2002, McDonald's was announced as the main sponsor of the Community Shield, in a four-year, £28 million pound contract. The deal included the company making an [...] "invest in 8,000 new community-based coaches for young players".|$|E

500|$|Throughout the journey, the duo {{encounter}} numerous mishaps: first, SpongeBob tries {{a pioneer}} trick {{he claims to}} have seen in a movie where he listens to the ground and hears a truck coming. But when he tries to get the driver's attention by doing a bizarre dance {{in the middle of the}} road, the driver speeds up and nearly runs over SpongeBob. Then, the duo are caught up in a storm that eventually turns into a tornado, and Squidward tells SpongeBob to let the pizza go as it causes them to get sucked into the tornado. However, the pizza saves their lives after SpongeBob turns it into a parachute. Upon landing, Squidward panics when he realizes the road they were following is nowhere in sight. SpongeBob then notices some moss on a rock and claims that they <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the direction the moss is pointing (another one of SpongeBob's [...] "pioneer tricks"), but Squidward refuses and goes in the other direction, despite there actually being civilization where the moss was pointing.|$|E
500|$|Time {{magazine}} television critic James Poniewozik said Ansari did [...] "an excellent job" [...] at {{showing a}} new side to Tom, and complimented the staging {{of the fourth}} floor sequence. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said [...] "Tom's Divorce" [...] was [...] "by design, more melancholy" [...] than previous Parks and Recreation episodes, but served to develop Tom's character and proved Aziz Ansari [...] "could tone it down and play a quieter, sadder Tom for once". Sepinwall said the Mark, Ann and Andy subplot was not as funny as in previous episodes. Entertainment Weekly writer Sandra Gonzalez {{said she had been}} awaiting a storyline centering on Tom, and said the episode [...] "makes us love the show more". However, she said Andy's continued obsession with Ann was growing tiresome and expressed hope his character <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> a new direction. Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode further added to the strong character development that has been consistent throughout the show's second season. Fowler also enjoyed the frightening portrayal of the fourth floor, which he said helps establish Pawnee as [...] "a place where both the engrossingly real and the entertainingly surreal can co-exist". GQ writer Dan Fierman praised the episode, particularly Ron's character and the singing telegram [...] "divorce horse".|$|E

2500|$|The new Constitution gave a clear {{indication}} of where the architects of UDI thought Rhodesia <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> political terms. The concept of [...] "separate development" [...] for blacks and whites was written into that constitution. The concept of eventual parity of parliamentary representation between the races was also adopted. This last feature underpinned the concept of 'equal partnership between black and white' as an alternative to majority rule. However, the leaders of the UDI state made it clear that parity of representation could be deferred indefinitely, if not for ever. White immigration figures for the 1960s encouraged them to believe that {{it might be possible to}} significantly alter the demographic balance, given enough time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next thing}} done was to {{construct}} a raft, on which the crew remained when it became dangerous to be on board the wreck; and it was, on consultation determined to make the boat as substantial as possible and {{a portion of the}} crew by this means might reach the mainland, and obtain assistance for those left on the reef. With considerable labour two strakes were added to the topsides, formed out of paling's which were on board, and on the 14th June all was ready for a start. The crew drew lots as to who <b>should</b> ,<b>go</b> <b>in</b> the boat, and they fell to Captain Geach, the chief officer, the steward, Mr. Simmens a passenger, and two natives.|$|E
2500|$|Outside of cinema, Wong {{has been}} heavily {{influenced}} by literature. He has a particular affinity for Latin American writers, and the fragmentary nature of his films came primarily from the [...] "scrapbook structures" [...] of novels by Manuel Puig and Julio Cortázar, which he attempted to emulate. Haruki Murakami, particularly his novel Norwegian Wood, also provided inspiration, as did the writing of Liu Yichang. The television channel MTV was a further influence on Wong. He said in 1998, [...] "in the late eighties, {{when it was first}} shown in Hong Kong, we were all really impressed with the energy and the fragmented structure. It seemed like we <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> this direction." ...|$|E

2500|$|Resigning {{from the}} National Hospital in 1892, Rivers {{travelled}} to Jena {{to expand his}} knowledge of experimental psychology. Whilst in Jena, Rivers became fluent in German and attended lectures, not only on psychology but on philosophy as well. He also became deeply immersed in the culture; in a diary he kept of the journey he comments on the buildings, the picture galleries, the church services, and the education system, showing his wide interests and critical judgement. In this diary he also wrote that: [...] "I have {{during the last three}} weeks {{come to the conclusion that}} I <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> for insanity when I return to England and work as much as possible at psychology." ...|$|E
