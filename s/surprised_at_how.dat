WIth Satánico reduced schedule Virus also {{took over a}} large portion of the training that El Satánico had been responsible for earlier. In a later interview he commented that he always wanted to become a trainer, he was just <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> quickly it happened.|$|E
5|$|Lars' {{inclusion}} in Naruto Shipuuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 was initially conceived of by CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama. In 2009, Matsuyama {{read in a}} Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine that Lars' third costume had been designed by Kishimoto and thought he {{should be included in}} Ultimate Ninja Storm 2. As a result, Matsuyama approached Tekken 6 producer Suguru Sasaki and his team and asked them to include Lars in the game using Kishimoto's outfit. Once this was approved, the Tekken staff started assisting CyberConnect2 to adjust Lars' moves to fit the other characters in the Naruto game. When the work was concluded, Matsuyama was <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> well Lars fitted in with the game's cast.|$|E
5|$|The chefs were {{initially}} <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> busy {{they were at}} lunchtimes; Harveys had been based next to Wandsworth Common and so the typically slow lunch service was used to give the chefs a break. Now based near Hyde Park, they had {{four or five times}} the number of covers for a lunch service than before. White remained determined to gain his third Michelin star, and to achieve this, he sought to emulate and surpass the food and service at Pierre Koffman's three Michelin star restaurant La Tante Claire. White worked 14/15 hour days for six days a week, expecting similar hours from those chefs under him, with the restaurant only closed on Sundays.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the episode}} [...] "Between The Darkness And The Light", {{the viewer is}} shown {{the result of the}} organic {{technology}} being retrofitted onto the hull of the standard Omega design. The character of Susan Ivanova (who was commanding the force of White Stars) expressed <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> quickly this was achieved.|$|R
50|$|Blackburn has {{expressed}} <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> {{he can get}} on with people and develop relationships after what he has been through, indeed he started a relationship with a woman (Norma) whilst still in prison. He states that she was a great support to him when he left prison and their relationship is ongoing (as of early 2007).|$|R

5|$|Hinckley was {{convinced}} {{that he would be}} Foster's equal if he became a national figure. He decided to emulate Bickle and began stalking President Jimmy Carter. He was <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> easy it was to get close to the president—he was only a foot away at one event—but was arrested in October 1980 at Nashville International Airport for illegal possession of firearms. Carter had made a campaign stop there, but the FBI did not connect this arrest to the President and did not notify the United States Secret Service. His parents briefly placed him under the care of a psychiatrist. Hinckley subsequently turned his attention to Ronald Reagan whose election, he told his parents, {{would be good for the}} country. He wrote three or four more notes to Foster in early March 1981. Foster gave these notes to her dean, who gave them to the Yale police department, who sought but failed to track Hinckley down.|$|E
5|$|Mauve took Van Gogh on as {{a student}} and {{introduced}} him to watercolour, which he worked on for the next month before returning home for Christmas. He quarrelled with his father, refusing to attend church, and left for The Hague. Within a month Van Gogh and Mauve fell out, possibly over the viability of drawing from plaster casts. Van Gogh could afford to hire only people from the street as models, a practice of which Mauve seems to have disapproved. In June Van Gogh suffered a bout of gonorrhoea and spent three weeks in hospital. Soon after, he first painted in oils, bought with money borrowed from Theo. He liked the medium, and spread the paint liberally, scraping from the canvas and working back with the brush. He wrote that he was <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> good the results were.|$|E
500|$|In {{the other}} semi-final Maguire beat Lee 6–4 in an error-strewn match which lasted four hours. After winning {{the first two}} frames Maguire lost the next three, but [...] "kept his cool" [...] to seal the victory. Maguire said the match was a [...] "battle" [...] {{and that he was}} <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> badly his opponents had played in the tournament, while Lee said he [...] "just blew up" [...] and that, [...] "When you’re as poor as that you get into such a state of mind that you can’t think straight".|$|E
50|$|The Game Boy version {{received}} {{very positive}} reviews from Electronic Gaming Monthly and GamePro, {{both of which}} expressed <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> accurately it recreated the Super NES version, particularly special effects like the scaling plane in the first level. Two of EGMs reviewers commented that they felt the games only weakness was the awkward control configuration when playing it on the Super Game Boy.|$|R
50|$|News of the {{discovery}} was passed to Jacques Cassini in Paris. He was able to confirm the comet's position, though with extreme <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> little it had moved since the first observation nearly a month previously. Cassini was able to continue observation until 18 January 1730, by which time the comet was located in Vulpecula. This was an extraordinarily long period for observation of a comet, though it never rose above apparent magnitude 3-4.|$|R

Following the tournament, McIlroy went on to admit his <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> successful it had been, and that he had been wrong to dismiss it.|$|R
500|$|Mills {{said that}} she liked to cook {{traditional}} vegetarian Christmas dinners for McCartney and as many of his family as possible, and that McCartney had encouraged her {{to give up her}} self-confessed addiction to chocolate and Snickers bars. When asked by chat-show host Larry King in 2003, how life was with McCartney, Mills replied [...] "Great, really great", but also {{said that she}} was <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> tidy McCartney was: [...] "He always cleans up before the cleaner comes. So I said for a while that's crazy, but what's good is if I cook the dinner, he'll clean everything up." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} and art {{design of the}} game was praised. Brandon Justice from Electronic Gaming Monthly stated that he expected the game to look [...] "bland" [...] due to its setting, but he was <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> much variety and color there was. The game's level design and vibrant colors were also praised. Critics agreed that the game's setting, Dubai, was excellent and well-realized; some critics praised Yager for adding different details to the game's world. The terrain and landscape was praised for being interesting, unique, and creating [...] "fantastic set piece battles". Some commented that the sand mechanic sometimes became gimmicky. Many criticized the game's poor textures and the poor rendering of cutscenes.|$|E
500|$|While {{briefing}} Saswata Chatterjee {{about his}} character, the cold-blooded killer Bob Biswas, Ghosh {{used the phrase}} [...] "Binito Bob" [...] (meaning polite Bob), which crystallised the notion of Bob's manners. Further discussions led to the inclusion of paunch and a bald patch. Chatterjee devised the mannerism of rubbing his nails together as some Indians believe doing that helps prevent hair loss. The mannerism was well-noted and praised by the viewers. Ghosh was <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> Bob Biswas was greeted by fans as a cult figure. He emphasised that the deliberate ordinariness of Bob Biswas was portrayed so convincingly by Chatterjee that the viewers can expect Bob to be around them {{at any time and}} any place.|$|E

We see inside Grandmother's cottage and outside, a glade. The Wolf, pretending to be Riding Hood, manages to get into the house and swallow Grandmother. He takes her place in the bed before Riding Hood arrives. In several {{questions}} she expresses her <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> differently Grandmother looks now, and the Wolf swallows her.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the mall}}'s opening months, around October 1999, many shoppers {{expressed}} <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> small the mall was: although it appeared quite large from the outside, {{much of the}} space {{was taken by the}} mall's two anchor stores, Dillard's and Sears, leaving little room for the mall's single main corridor. Many local residents began calling the Mall [...] "The Hall" [...] or [...] "The Small", because most of the stores were built along just this one relatively short passage of corridor.|$|R
500|$|That convention, in May 1776, {{unanimously}} instructed Jefferson {{and other}} Virginia delegates to Congress to seek [...] "a clear and full Declaration of Independency". At the same time, the convention resolved {{to pass a}} declaration of rights. Due to ill-health, Mason did not arrive until May 18, 1776, after the vote, but was appointed to a committee led by Archibald Cary, which was to compose a declaration of rights and constitution. Mason was skeptical that the thirty-person Cary Committee could collectively compose anything worthwhile, but was <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> quickly it moved—though his membership {{had a role in}} that speed. On May 24, convention president Edmund Pendleton wrote to Jefferson about the committee's deliberations, [...] "as Colo. Mason seems to have the ascendancy in the great work, I have Sanguine hopes it will be framed so as to Answer it's [...] end, Prosperity to the Community and Security to Individuals".|$|E
500|$|During the {{development}} of the series' pilot chapter, Rurouni, Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story, Watsuki and his editor argued over Kenshin's speech patterns, settling for a [...] "slangy" [...] one. For {{the final version of the}} first Romantic Story, Watsuki adjusted the dialogue; in his view, he made Kenshin sound [...] "more as I prefer him now". Nevertheless, Kenshin was concerned about how Kenshin's manner abruptly changed when facing his opponent. Watsuki added Kenshin's trademark [...] as a placeholder to be an expression of the English speech disfluency [...] "huh". Watsuki notes that he was <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> well it caught on, and how much he ended up having Kenshin use the sound during the series. Watsuki also planned to make Kenshin more 30 years old; his editor commented that it was strange that the main character of a manga for teenagers to be of such an age, so he instead made him 28 years old.|$|E
500|$|Leon {{was created}} by Hideki Kamiya as a {{contrast}} to Chris Redfield from the original Resident Evil, who he felt was the [...] "blunt, tough-guy type". Though Kamiya admitted {{that while he was}} a fan of characters like Chris, as it had already been done, he opted to take Leon's development in a different direction. He was <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> popular Leon had become, praising his later evolution into a [...] "cool looking guy" [...] for Resident Evil 4 and adding that he [...] "fell in love all over again". Leon was created for Resident Evil 2 as the staff wanted to use a character who had no experience with terrifying situations in contrast to using returning protagonists. While he was originally designed as a veteran police officer, he was changed to a rookie after the original version of Resident Evil 2 (popularly known as [...] "Resident Evil 1.5") had been scrapped. Leon's design was inspired by the bloodhound of Capcom artist Isao Ohishi.|$|E
5000|$|O’Brien has {{expressed}} <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> {{the book has}} become a staple in middle schools and high schools, stating that he [...] "certainly hadn’t imagined fourteen year-old kids and eighteen year-olds and those even in their early twenties reading the book and bringing such fervor to it, which comes from their own lives, really. The book is applied to a bad childhood or a broken home, {{and these are the}} things they're carrying. And in a way, it's extremely flattering, and other times, it can be depressing." ...|$|R
50|$|Tama-chan is the (approximately 5-year-old) {{next door}} {{neighbor}} of the Bottle Fairies and Sensei-san. In the 12th episode, March, she graduates from first grade. She {{is represented by the}} color purple and wears crayons in her hair with a large white ribbon down the back. She is happy to help the Bottle Fairies, who trust her (usually misleading) advice since she seems so self-assured. She occasionally expresses <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> childlike the fairies are even though {{they are supposed to be}} older than she is. Additionally, she was the mascot of the magazine Magi-Cu.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2013, Baker's co-star Eve Morey {{explained}} that Callum {{would start to}} rebel against his parents in future storylines and revealed her <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> well adjusted Callum is. She said [...] "I can tell you it's starting. And it's actually really good, because we're doing a few storylines now, where he's starting to explore that darker side of being a teenager. And I think that's really good for him." [...] Morey added that Callum had to grow up quickly and be [...] "very emotionally mature", so she was not surprised that his pent up anger begins to appear.|$|R
500|$|... "Holding the gun {{became a}} {{controversial}} thing 'cause we filmed it in London, and they don't {{have a lot}} of gun use out there. That doesn't mean that there's no gun use, so I did find it really interesting. For me, the thing is, it blew me away that members of [...] Parliament were speaking about this. One, because it's a music video, and two, because don't you guys have television shows out there that show crime? It's really strange to me. I don't understand why pop stars are put on such a high pedestal over other celebrities. Why do members of Parliament feel that they need to scrutinize her for having a gun, and 'She's in the public,' and 'She should know better,' and 'She's a role model,' but what about every other celebrity out there? What about every other actor? That's very strange to me. I was really <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> much the gun use was scrutinized. [...] a professional criminal, so it makes sense he has a gun. We shouldn't censor ourselves." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Michael Schumacher broke into tears when asked if matching Ayrton Senna's number of victories {{meant a lot to}} him. He later regained his composure and spoke about how important it was to maintain the life of the engine at the circuit. Michael Schumacher revealed that the cause of his emotion was of him thinking about Senna's death at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix and said that he was <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> the media reacted to the moment which said that Schumacher [...] "was human after all". Häkkinen revealed that his team made modifications to his car at his pit stop which contributed to him setting the fastest lap of the race. He also admitted that he was unable to catch Michael Schumacher due to the presence of the two Minardis which cost him time. Ralf Schumacher said he was not worried from being challenged by Verstappen and Zonta during the event because of the Williams's quick pace. He also was confident that Williams had confirmed itself as the third strongest team in Formula One.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{intended}} for the character to make only two guest appearances in the third season, which left Ferris [...] "a bit surprised and [...] " [...] at Ellen's lack of involvement. However, her initial return was scrapped due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, and the actress declined a guest appearance in the finale because the lackluster offer [...] "could cost [...] money and work". The opportunity to return for the fifth season surprised her due to the large time span since her previous appearance. Though she expected her character to eventually die, a devastated Ferris was <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> quickly it occurred. However, after speaking to director Phil Sgricciahe told her that Ellen was the [...] "perfect fodder" [...] for the [...] "kick" [...] that the series needed, and would [...] "go out {{in a blaze of}} glory"the actress came to realize that the character's death made sense. Ellen's last words to Dean"Kick it in the ass."was an improvised homage to the late Supernatural executive producer and director Kim Manners, who had died the year before and would often recite the phrase before filming a scene.|$|E

"I am <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> {{discovering}} <b>how</b> {{little of}} a Dutch character remains in this state," [...] said the baronet; [...] "I can scarcely trace {{that people in}} any thing, and yet, I believe, they had the moulding of your society, having carried the colony through its infancy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then he said--" [...] And she related almost {{word for}} word some of his tenderest speeches.

25|$|By {{this point}} Dee had begun efforts {{to mount the}} system to its {{intended}} platform, the Bristol Beaufighter. Hodgkin {{was put in charge}} of getting Bristol to provide an example with the radome fit, but he found that the engineer in charge of the workshop was reluctant to do so. High-level pressure from Dee and others followed, and X7579 was quickly adapted, arriving at Christchurch in September 1941. At the time the Mk. VII consisted {{of a large number of}} fairly large equipment boxes that were entirely unsuitable for production use, and Hodgkin expressed his <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> well the work progressed in spite of this. The aircraft was ready for testing on 2 October.|$|R
500|$|In 2007, Beck {{released}} the single [...] "Timebomb", which {{was nominated for}} a Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance. For his next studio effort, his tenth, Beck tapped Danger Mouse to produce, and the two first met in December 2007 to record. The duo knocked out two tracks in two days, but the notion that the album would be finished in a timely fashion soon evaporated. Beck had known Danger Mouse casually before, as many of his former musicians ended up working with Danger Mouse's side project, Gnarls Barkley. Still, the musicians were <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> well they got along. Following the grueling recording schedule, Beck was exhausted, calling it [...] "the most intense work I've ever done on anything", relating that he [...] "did at least 10 weeks with no days off, until four or five in the morning every night." [...] Beck's original vision was a short 10-track burst with two-minute songs, but the songs gradually grew as he fit 'two years of songwriting into two and a half months." [...] Modern Guilt (2008) was [...] "full of off-kilter rhythms and left-field breakdowns, with an overall 1960s vibe." ...|$|E
500|$|The Australia Council's {{decision}} to fund Escape from Woomera was poorly received. The game received heavy criticism before development even began. Australia's Minister for Immigration, Philip Ruddock, {{released a statement}} saying that the [...] "decision reflects poorly upon the Australia Council and its judgement, that the organisation should lend its name to the promotion of unlawful behaviour". Kate Wild, in a 2013 interview, recalled that she was <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> strongly Ruddock attacked the game, a reaction she attributed to the government being sensitive over the issue of detainee treatment. The leader of the Australian Human Rights Commission, Dr. Sev Ozdowski, released a strongly worded statement accusing the game of misconstruing asylum seekers as criminals, and saying that [...] "The idea of using issues in detention for entertainment is simply sick." [...] Chairman Michael Snelling of the New Media Arts Board, the branch of the Australia Council that granted the development money, defended the {{decision to}} fund Escape from Woomera, stating that the game's purpose was not to promote crime. He characterised the team's application for funding as both strong and closely aligned with the New Media Arts Board's goal of promoting cross-disciplinary media.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{disliked the}} game's control scheme, many {{stating that the}} use of the Wii remote was awkward and {{difficult}} to master. Bozon condemned the lack of refined flight control and noted that it was easier to use either the Classic Controller or the GameCube controller. Similarly, Scullion said that out of the three control schemes, the Wii remote was the least accurate option. VanOrd also criticized the poorly implemented use of the Wii remote, and Rosenberg thought its controls were overly responsive and unpolished; both reviewers recommended using the Classic Controller's analogue stick as an alternative. Dickens recognised that the original Nights into Dreams {{was one of the first}} games to benefit from an analogue stick, and was therefore <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> the sequel had a [...] "control scheme crisis": multiple control schemes might add confusion for new players. Govan suggested that the reason why the game featured alternative control schemes was that Sonic Team wanted to emulate the original Saturn controls. In contrast, the reviewer from Jeuxvideo.com found little fault with any of the game's control schemes, and Bedigan labelled them as [...] "excellent". Both reviewers, however, agreed that the Wii remote's motion controls did not work well with the game.|$|E
5000|$|In his New York Times {{review of}} the 2006 concert revival, Charles Isherwood called Of Thee I Sing [...] "a trenchant little musical satire... the {{laughter}} that greets the show today is tinged with <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> eerily some of its jokes seem to take precise aim, from decades back, at current affairs. A chorus of reporters sings to {{the new president of}} the '17 vacations you have had since you've been here.' A politician dismisses Abraham Lincoln's pronouncement {{about not being able to}} fool all of the people all the time by remarking: 'It's different nowadays. People are bigger suckers.' ...it serves as a sigh-inducing argument for the enduring follies of American politics." ...|$|R

[...] It was graded A− by Entertainment Weekly, which said, [...] "you {{will find a}} rather fascinating drama." [...] Entertainment Weekly also commented on Billie Piper's portrayal of Belle, saying, [...] "Piper is extraordinary, intermittently talking right to the camera in a straightforward, conspiratorial manner, the way a prostitute who's really good at her job would talk to a client." [...] It was less well received, however, by The New York Times, which said, [...] "Secret Diary has amusing touches, {{but not enough to}} sustain an entire series." ...|$|R
50|$|His best-known character, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1999 to season 3 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer as Buffy's replacement Watcher. Originally, Wyndam-Pryce {{was supposed to be}} killed off in the season 3 finale but, due to Whedon's <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> well he fit into the series, Denisof was given the choice about his character's fate and chose for him to live. As a result, he later showed up in season one, episode 10 of Angel, and was an official main cast member from episode 11 (effectively replacing Doyle), appearing in 100 out of the 110 episodes of the series. The character was heavily endeared to fans due to the transformation from goofy and lovable, to dark, depressed and moody as a result of events that occur {{over the course of the}} series.|$|R
