40|$|There is {{evidence}} for the need of a more economic needle remover to reduce the volume of sharps waste {{in third world countries}} and lead to safer practices with sharps disposal. I have developed a low cost device that can attach to globally disseminated <b>safety</b> <b>boxes</b> and remove needles from syringes reducing the volume of sharps and encouraging safe disposal practices. My plans for dissemination of this technology include applying for grant money from NCIIA and The Global Fund for the manufacturing and packaging of the device for dissemination through the World Health Organization (WHO) to hospitals and clinics with <b>safety</b> <b>boxes</b> to adhere the device and instruct healthcare workers how to use it. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a study to assess the effectiveness and sustainability of a GAVI (Global Alliance of Vaccines and Immunization) sponsored, time-limited Injection Safety (INS) support. The support came in two forms: 1) in-kind, in the form of AD syringes and <b>safety</b> <b>boxes,</b> and 2) in cash, for those countries that already had a secure, multi-year source of AD syringes and <b>safety</b> <b>boxes,</b> but proposed to use INS support to strengthen their injection safety activities. In total, GAVI gave INS support for a three-year period to 58 countries: 46 with commodities and 12 with cash support. To identify variables that might be associated with financial sustainability, frequencies and cross-tabulations were run against various programmatic and socio-economic variables in the 58 countries. All but two of the 46 commodity-recipient countries were able to replace and sustain the use of AD syringes and <b>safety</b> <b>boxes</b> after the end of their GAVI INS support despite the fact that standard disposable syringes are less costly than ADs (10 - 15 percent differential). In addition, all 12 cash-recipient countries continued to use AD syringes and <b>safety</b> <b>boxes</b> in their immunization programs in the years following GAVI INS assistance. At the same time, countries were often not prepared for the increased waste management requirements {{associated with the use of}} the syringes, suggesting the importance of anticipating challenges with the introduction of new technologies. The sustained use of AD syringes in countries receiving injection safety support from GAVI, in a majority of cases through government financing, following the completion of three years of time-limited support, represents an early indication of how GHPs can contribute to improved health outcomes in immunization safety in the world's poorest countries in a sustainable way...|$|R

40|$|Solid {{waste in}} the form of used jerrycans in Wates Local Public Hospital is {{comprised}} of two types, i. e. the 5 L jerrycan which was contained acid liquid and the 10 L jerrycan which was contained bicarbonate fluid.

On May 9, Dominion turned the source code, which was in a CD, to the commission. Dominion, the commission and SLI Global Solutions, which had certified the source code months earlier, encrypted the source code on a computer provided by the commission.

50|$|At home, Dan knocks {{over the}} <b>safety</b> <b>box,</b> {{cracking}} it open. Within it, {{he finds the}} 1860 diary of Don Miguel Robles (Edward Colmans), the former owner of the land. According to the diary, Don Robles sent his son Drago to Madrid on business without his new bride Isabella (Jeanna Cross). Isabella turned to Drago's brother Roberto (Henry Delgado) for companionship. When Drago returns and learns of their relationship, he killed his brother with a dagger; distraught, Drago later committed suicide with the same dagger. Over the next six months, mysterious deaths of young girls take place. One night Don Robles hears Isabella scream and went to her room, finding a man bent over her - Drago Robles, who fled, leaving Isabella drained of blood. To end the curse, Don Robles plunged a silver dagger through Drago’s heart as he lay in his coffin. After confessing his actions to the priest he learned a wooden stake is needed to destroy a vampire - he returns but finds the coffin empty except for the dagger. Hidden within the diary is a photograph of Drago Robles - it is Drake Robey in Spanish clothing.|$|E

Bernard insists that he is seen to before the other customers, and intimidated, Cynthia allows Danny to show him to his <b>safety</b> deposit <b>box</b> before her. Shortly afterwards a group of bank thieves including Paul (Torrance Coombs), Washington (Mykel Shannon Jenkins), Biggs (Nick Principe), AJ (Mark Kelly), Rick (Ken Lyle), Tracey (Kristina Klebe) and Ally (Camilla Jackson) arrive to rob the bank.

40|$|Embedded {{software}} {{systems are}} usually custom designed and are close systems {{in terms of}} software design and deployment. One example is the Vehicle Information Sys-tem (VIS), in which several components gather vehicle information such as RPM and fuel tank level, and are tightly coupled with the embedded hardware. Several projects have been started by commercial software companies or passionate open source devel-opers {{to meet the needs}} for entertainment, gathering vehicle information, and traffic in-formation in vehicle. We design and implement a software integration framework for such systems and a vehicle <b>safety</b> <b>box</b> component for VIS. The framework allows the users and developers to integrate independently developed software components into one system and provides a unified GUI. In addition, it eliminates the efforts for re-designing or re-compiling the system for software upgrades...|$|E
40|$|Background: {{hospital}} personnel {{are at high}} risk of exposure, infection, and transmission of viral hepatitis. The present study aimed at investigating the knowledge, attitude, and performance of health service providers to provide them with the information required for their educational promotion on viral hepatitis. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 400 staff of the forenamed healthcare settings such as on nurses, midwives, licensed practical nurses, and lab officials in Isfahan, Iran, in 2012. A checklist including demographic data and questions associated with the knowledge (18 questions), attitude (4 questions), and performance (15 questions) on hepatitis B and C was completed by the participants. Results: A total of 388 participants completed the checklist. Participants′ knowledge on the ways of transmission, prevalence, vaccination, and prevention methods was moderate (total score = 58. 56 ± 10. 1 percent) and the attitude was generally positive. Proper vaccination was carried out by 81. 4 % of the participants. Accidental injury by a needle was reported in 47. 7 % of the participants, but only 37. 6 % of them reported it to higher authorities and of them only 13. 7 % received appropriate treatment. Only 44. 3 % and 11. 6 % of participants reported always using gloves and masks, respectively, and 58. 8 % of the staff covered the needle cap before transferring it to the <b>safety</b> <b>box.</b> Conclusions: Due to excessive contact with patients, a paramedic-educated society is expected to have an optimal level of knowledge, attitude, and performance related to viral hepatitis. Our results from the checklists showed that medical personnel are not appropriately aware of viral hepatitis and their performance, too, is not satisfactory. Further continuous training is required and there needs to be more emphasis on actions regarding behaviors with high risk of infection transmission...|$|E
