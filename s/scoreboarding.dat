50|$|Arguably {{the first}} machine to use out-of-order {{execution}} was the CDC 6600 (1964), which used a scoreboard to resolve conflicts (although in modern usage, such <b>scoreboarding</b> {{is considered to}} be in-order execution, not out-of-order execution, since such machines stall on the first RAW conflict - strictly speaking, such machines initiate execution in-order, although they may complete execution out-of-order).|$|E
50|$|The major {{innovations}} of Tomasulo’s algorithm include register renaming in hardware, reservation {{stations for}} all execution units, {{and a common}} data bus (CDB) on which computed values broadcast to all reservation stations that may need them. These developments allow for improved parallel execution of instructions that would otherwise stall under the use of <b>scoreboarding</b> or other earlier algorithms.|$|E
50|$|An {{associative}} array can {{be thought}} of as a binary search tree with a user-specified key type and data type. The key implies an ordering; the elements of an associative array can be read out in lexicographic order. Finally, a queue provides much of the functionality of the C++ STL deque type: elements can be added and removed from either end efficiently. These primitives allow the creation of complex data structures required for <b>scoreboarding</b> a large design.|$|E

50|$|<b>Scoreboarding</b> is a {{centralized}} method, {{used in the}} CDC 6600 computer, for dynamically scheduling a pipeline so that the instructions can execute out of order {{when there are no}} conflicts and the hardware is available. In a scoreboard, the data dependencies of every instruction are logged. Instructions are released only when the scoreboard determines that there are no conflicts with previously issued and incomplete instructions. If an instruction is stalled because it is unsafe to continue, the scoreboard monitors the flow of executing instructions until all dependencies have been resolved before the stalled instruction is issued.|$|E
50|$|Another {{usage of}} the {{microarchitecture}} simulator is in education. Given that a course in computer architecture teaches students many different microprocessor's features and its architectures, the microarchitecture simulator is ideal for modeling and experimenting with different features and architectures {{over the course of}} a semester. For example, students may start with a microarchitecture simulator that models a simple microprocessor design at the beginning of a semester. As the semester progresses, additional features, such as instruction pipelining, register renaming, reservation stations, out-of-order execution, and <b>scoreboarding,</b> can be modeled and added to the simulator as they are introduced in the classroom. Microarchitecture simulator provides the flexibility of reconfiguration and testing with minimal costs.|$|E
50|$|The stream {{processing}} paradigm simplifies parallel {{software and hardware}} by restricting the parallel computation that can be performed. Given a sequence of data (a stream), a series of operations (kernel functions) is applied to each element in the stream. Kernel functions are usually pipelined, and optimal local on-chip memory reuse is attempted, {{in order to minimize}} the loss in bandwidth, accredited to external memory interaction. Uniform streaming, where one kernel function is applied to all elements in the stream, is typical. Since the kernel and stream abstractions expose data dependencies, compiler tools can fully automate and optimize on-chip management tasks. Stream processing hardware can use <b>scoreboarding,</b> for example, to initiate a direct memory access (DMA) when dependencies become known. The elimination of manual DMA management reduces software complexity, and an associated elimination for hardware cached I/O, reduces the data area expanse that has to be involved with service by specialized computational units such as arithmetic logic units.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} {{the design of}} an IP core of Multiprocessor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) {{in the context of}} {{microarchitecture}} of the Scheduling Processor targeted for multicore systems is explored. This scheduling processor schedules the tasks i. e. units of computation in parallel for execution on different processors and IP cores. As this model is dealing with Out-of-Order (OoO) execution, the data dependencies like Read-after-Write (RAW), Write-after-Read (WAR) and Write-after-Write (WAW) imposes the challenging constraints on the direct use of techniques like register renaming and dynamic scheduling at instruction level. The <b>scoreboarding</b> algorithm with parameter renaming technique at task level analyzes the data dependencies in order to solve the stalling problem occurring in OoO execution. Thus the scheduler schedules different tasks in OoO manner. The model for the same has been verified by using resulting timing diagram. The results demonstrate that the model can largely release the burden on programmers as well as uncover the task level parallelism (TLP).

40|$|Multimedia {{components}} for the visualization of dynamic behavior in computer architectures Understanding modern processors requires a good {{knowledge of the}} dynamic behavior of processors. Traditional media like books use text for describing the dynamic behavior of processors. Visualization of this behavior, however, is impossible, due to the static nature of books. In this paper, we describe multimedia {{components for}} visualizing the dynamic behavior of hardware structures, called RaVi (abbreviation for the German equivalent of “computer architecture visualization”). Available RaVi components 1 include models of a microcoded MIPS architecture, of a MIPS pipeline, of <b>scoreboarding,</b> Tomasulo’s algorithm and the MESI multiprocessor cache protocol. ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} days of baseball, before {{electronic}} <b>scoreboards,</b> manual score turners used a ticker to get the latest scores from around the league. Today, computers and electronic <b>scoreboards</b> have replaced the manual <b>scoreboard</b> and the ticker.|$|R
5000|$|Along with Fenway Park's <b>scoreboard</b> and AT&T Park's {{out of town}} <b>scoreboard,</b> Wrigley is one of {{the last}} parks to {{maintain}} a hand-turned <b>scoreboard.</b> Unlike the home of the Red Sox, the <b>scoreboard</b> at Wrigley is mounted above the centerfield bleachers, rather than at ground level, making it harder to hit during play. No players have hit the current <b>scoreboard,</b> although several have come close. The <b>scoreboard</b> was installed in 1937, when Bill Veeck installed the new bleachers. The <b>scoreboard</b> has remained in place ever since, and it has only seen minor modifications. The clock was added in 1941, a fifth row of scores was added to each side in 1961; by 1969, a sixth. A set of light stands facing onto the <b>scoreboard</b> was added in 1988 with the introduction of night games. The centerfield bleacher <b>scoreboard</b> is still manually operated, with scores coming in through a computer (a ticker tape machine was used in the past); a number turner watches the score changes closely and updates scores by manually replacing the numbers from within the <b>scoreboard.</b> The <b>scoreboard</b> is made of sheet steel. The numbers that are placed into the inning windows are also steel, painted forest green, and numbered with white numerals. The box for the game playing at Wrigley uses yellow numerals for the current inning. The clock, which sits at the top center of the <b>scoreboard,</b> has never lost time in its 78-year existence. Standing over the clock are three flagpoles, one for each division in the National League. There are 15 flags, one for each National League team, and their order on the flagpoles reflects the current standings. The entrance to the <b>scoreboard</b> is a trap-door on the bottom. On the reverse of the <b>scoreboard,</b> visible from the CTA elevated trains, is a blue pennant, with the words [...] "Chicago Cubs", in white outlined in red neon. The <b>scoreboard</b> was extensively rehabilitated for the 2010 season.|$|R

50|$|For {{baseball}} the <b>scoreboard</b> will at {{the minimum}} show both team scores, {{as well as}} the current inning. In addition the number of balls, strikes and outs is represented by digits or individual lights. Larger <b>scoreboards</b> offer an inning-by-inning breakdown of the scores, hits, errors, pitch count and the time of day. There may also be another display either separate or combined with the <b>scoreboard</b> listing the radar gun reading of the last pitch thrown in miles per hour. Almost all Major League facilities have a video board as a <b>scoreboard</b> or a matrix display. Usually these <b>scoreboards</b> are controlled via programs that keep statistics and not just the score. Usually the official scorer will operate this program. Then all the information the official scorer will enter, will automatically be made output to the <b>scoreboard.</b> Currently, the largest <b>scoreboards</b> are located at Progressive Field in Cleveland, Ohio, and Kansas City, Missouri's Kauffman Stadium.
