50|$|In computing, SMS {{phishing}} or <b>smishing</b> {{is a form}} {{of criminal}} activity using social engineering techniques. Phishing is the act of attempting to acquire personal information such as passwords and details by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. Short Message Service (SMS) is the technology used for text messages on cell phones.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, an {{increasing}} trend towards spamming mobile phone users through SMS prompted cellular-service carriers {{to take steps}} against the practice, before it became a widespread problem. No major spamming incidents involving SMS had been reported , but the existence of mobile phone spam has been noted by industry watchdogs including Consumer Reports magazine and the Utility Consumers' Action Network (UCAN). In 2005, UCAN brought a case against Sprint for spamming its customers and charging $0.10 per text message. The case was settled in 2006 with Sprint agreeing not to send customers Sprint advertisements via SMS. SMS expert Acision (formerly LogicaCMG Telecoms) reported {{a new type of}} SMS malice at the end of 2006, noting the first instances of <b>SMiShing</b> (a cousin to e-mail phishing scams). In <b>SMiShing,</b> users receive SMS messages posing to be from a company, enticing users to phone premium-rate numbers or reply with personal information. Similar concerns were reported by PhonepayPlus, a consumer watchdog in the United Kingdom, in 2012.|$|E
50|$|Platform switch: Cybercrime is {{switching}} its battle {{ground from}} Windows-system PCs to other platforms, including mobile phones, tablet computers, and VoIP. Because a significant threshold in vulnerabilities has been reached. PC vendors are building better security into their products by providing faster updates, patches and user alert to potential flaws. Besides, global mobile devices’ penetration—from smart phones to tablet PCs—accessing the Internet by 2013 will surpass 1 billion, creating {{more opportunities for}} cybercrime. The massively successful banking Trojan, Zeus is already being adapted for the mobile platform. <b>Smishing,</b> or SMS phishing, is another method cyber criminals are using to exploit mobile devices, which users download after falling prey to a social engineering ploy, is designed to defeat the SMS-based two-factor authentication most banks use to confirm online funds transfers by customers. VoIP systems {{are being used to}} support vishing (telephone-based phishing) schemes, which are now growing in popularity.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{exploratory}} assessment of Phishing, <b>SMiShing</b> and Vishing attacks against mobile devices. It examines {{the implications of}} end-user behavior towards mitigating the risks posed by using mobile devices for online services and facilities. Phishing is that socially engineered attack aimed at enticing unsuspecting users with familiar websites spoofed and purported {{to come from a}} legitimate organization or source. It lures the user to furnish the assailant with the user’s access credentials, for which privileged access would be gained to harm the user. <b>SMiShing</b> attacks also happen whenever text messages are sent for the user to either click on a link provided, which leads to a fraudulent website or for the attacker to get access to the user’s contacts and/or any other confidential information. Vishing is a voice phishing attack, whereby a voice call received from an assailant lures the target into providing personal information with the intention to use that information to cause harm. With the proliferation of smart phones, tablets and hotspots, these social engineering attacks on mobile devices are now prevalent. The study observed and strategically interviewed 20 end-users for their knowledge, perceptions and behavior when confronted with phishing attack situations. The results show that men are more comfortable and trusting on the cyber-space and thus more susceptible to phishing attacks than women. The results also indicate that most users are either slightly aware or not at all aware of Phishing, <b>SMiShing</b> and Vishing threats against their mobile devices. Interestingly, 55 % would occasionally examine the messages received as perceived threats, whilst 35...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive literature survey and analysis on Phishing, Vishing and <b>Smishing</b> {{to exploit the}} knowledge in implementing an intelligent tool for detection and protection. This is a new social engineering problem which makes our day to day life vulnerable and difficult. This investigation particularly focuses on phishing through email as it has more serious consequences directly related to financial transactions {{in comparison to the}} other methods. It is worth mentioning that securing the enormous amount of online transactions is very challenging since several methods are invented daily to breach individual privacy in order to steal their credentials. The cost of these types of attacks exceeds millions of dollars annually. Many tools are proposed to solve this problem; unfortunately, the dilemma still exists. This paper proposes a methodology to develop an intelligent tool and awareness security program to address the risk of this problem...|$|E
40|$|Short Message Service (SMS) {{is one of}} {{the popular}} {{communication}} services. However, this can contribute to increasing mobile device attacks. Presently, SMS phishing (<b>SMiShing)</b> attack is alarming to the mobile phone users because these attacks usually succeed in stealing information and money. Moreover, SMS phishing and spam are two different types of attack and level of risk. Thus, {{it is important to have}} a SMS phishing corpus. The established SMS corpus is limited to spam and none can be found suitable for SMS Phishing. This study proposes a technique to split the class of SMS phishing from SMS spam and produce better accuracy using the Bayesian technique. The result shows that the enhanced SMS corpus gets 99. 8064 % accurate classification. The study identified classes and generated an improvement of SMS Phishing corpus which has been labelled in three different classes ie., Ham, Spam and Phishing with better accuracy...|$|E
