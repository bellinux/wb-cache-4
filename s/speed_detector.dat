Current systems can be split into two main categories: hybrid pixel detectors and scintillator-coupled Charge-Coupled Devices (CCDs). Whilst both have limitations, CCD-based systems (coupled to fibre-optics to increase imaging area) are often used in these applications due to their small pixels and the high resolution. Electron-Multiplication CCDs (EM-CCDs) are able to suppress the readout noise associated with increased readout speed offering a low noise, high <b>speed</b> <b>detector</b> solution. A previous pilot study using a small-area (8 mm × 8 mm) scintillator-coupled EM-CCD found that through high frame-rates, low noise and novel uses of photon-counting, resolution could be improved from over 80 μm to 25 μm at 2 fps. To further improve this detector system, high speed readout electronics can be used alongside a fibre-optic taper and EM-CCD to create a “best of both worlds” solution consisting of the high resolution of a CCD, along with the low noise, high speed (high dynamic range) and large effective area of pixel detectors.

40|$|Abstract – A data Acquisition (DAQ) {{and control}} system is being {{developed}} for a pixel array detector {{that will be used}} for a single-particle scattering experiment at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). The experiment requires that sub-picosecond pulses of 8 kEV X-rays are scattered off single particles 120 times a second. The scattered x-rays are converted to charge in a 2 -dimensional pixelated diode array. The charge is integrated on to the 760 x 760 pixel detector readout chip and digitized in-pixel. The full detector is composed of tiled 185 x 192 pixel readout chips. The DAQ and control system provides low-level control of the integration and read-out processes, sets the detector mode of operation, addresses the pixels and transfers the data to high-speed local storage. Low-level data processing such as re-ordering, frame formatting and data averaging may also be required before data transfer. The DAQ and Control system is designed in a hierarchical and modular manner using a Xilinx XC 4 V 100 FX FPGA based DAQ board and is user controlled and monitored in software using master/slave command handshaking across the PCI Express bus.

40|$|Rationale and Objectives: The {{impact of}} varying image {{acquisition}} parameters on {{the precision of}} measurements using quantitative computed tomography is currently based on studies performed {{before the advent of}} helical image acquisition and multidetector-row scanners. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate helical multidetector-row quantitative computed tomography to determine the factors contributing to the overall precision of measurements on quantitative computed tomography conducted using current vintage computed tomographic (CT) scanners. Materials and Methods: The effects of CT protocol parameters (x-ray tube voltage and current, pitch, gantry rotation <b>speed,</b> <b>detector</b> configuration, table height, and reconstruction algorithm) and short-term scanner variation were examined on two commercially available quantitative CT (QCT) systems (ie, a combination of reference phantoms and analysis software) using seven multidetector-row CT scanners (available from a single vendor) operated in helical mode. Combined with simulated patient repositioning using three ex vivo spine specimens, precision (coefficient of variation) estimates were made on the basis of three scenarios: "best case," "routine case," and "worst case. ". Results: The overall best-case QCT precision was 1. 4, provided that no changes were permitted to the bone mineral density (BMD) scan protocol. Routine-case examination (with a BMD reference phantom in place) that permitted some variation in the x-ray tube current and table speed produced a precision of 1. 8. Without any constraints on the clinical QCT examinations, the worst-case precision was estimated at 3. 6. Conclusions: Although small in appearance, these errors are for single time points and may increase substantially when monitoring changes through QCT measurements over several time points. This calls for increased caution and attention to detail whenever using helical multidetector-row quantitative computed tomography for the assessment of BMD change. Â© 2009 AUR...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project {{was to develop a}} vector controlled induction motor drive operating without a speed or position sensor but having a dynamic performance comparable to a sensored vector drive. The methodology was to detect the motor speed from the machine rotor slot harmonics using digital signal processing and to use this signal to tune a speed estimator and thus reduce or eliminate the estimator’s sensitivity to parameter variations. Derivation of a speed signal from the rotor slot harmonics using a Discrete Fourier Transform-based algorithm has yielded highly accurate and robust speed signals above machine frequencies of about 2 Hz and independent of machine loads. The detection, which has been carried out using an Intel i 860 processor in parallel with the main vector controller, has been found to give predictable and consistent results duing speed transient conditions. The speed signal obtained from the rotor slot harmonics has been used to tune a Model Reference Adaptive speed and flux observer, with the resulting sensorless drive operating to steady state speed accuracies down to 0. 02 rpm above 2 Hz (i. e. 60 rpm for the 4 pole machine). A significant aspect of the research has been the mathematical derivation of the speed bandwidth limitations for both sensored and sensorless drives, thus allowing for quantitative comparison of their dynamic performance. It has been found that the speed bandwidth limitation for sensorless drives depends on the accuracy to which the machine parameters are known and that for maximum dynamic performance it is necessary to tune the flux and speed estimator against variations in stator resistance in addition to the tuning mechanism deriving from the DFT <b>speed</b> <b>detector.</b> New dynamic stator resistance tuning algorithms have been implemented. The resulting sensorless drive has been found to have a speed bandwidth equivalent to sensored drives fitted with medium resolution encoders (i. e. about 500 ppr), and a zero speed accuracy of ± 8 rpm under speed control. These specifications are superior to any reported in the research literature...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} {{development}} of the DSSC instrument: an ultra-high <b>speed</b> <b>detector</b> system for the new European XFEL in Hamburg. The DSSC will be able to record X-ray images with a maximum frame rate of 4. 5 MHz. The system is based on a silicon pixel sensor with a DEPFET as a central amplifier structure and has detection efficiency close to 100 % for X-rays from 0. 5 keV up to 10 keV. The sensor will have a size of approximately 210 x 210 mm(2) composed of 1024 x 1024 pixels with hexagonal shape. Two hundred fifty six mixed signal readout ASICs are bump-bonded to the detector. They are designed in 130 nm CMOS technology and provide full parallel readout. The signals coming from the sensor are processed by an analog filter, immediately digitized by 8 -bit ADCs and locally stored in an SRAM, which is able to record at least 640 frames. In order to fit the dynamic range of about 10 (4) photons of 1 keV per pixel into a reasonable output signal range, achieving at the same time single 1 keV photon resolution, a non-linear characteristic is required. The proposed DEPFET provides the needed dynamic range compression at the sensor level. The most exciting and challenging property is that the single 1 keV photon resolution and the high dynamic range are accomplished within the 220 ns frame rate of the system. The key properties and the main design concepts of the different building blocks of the system are discussed. Measurements with the analog front-end of the readout ASIC and a standard DEPFET have already shown a very low noise which makes it possible to achieve the targeted single photon resolution for 1 keV photons at 4. 5 MHz and also for 0. 5 keV photons at half of the speed. In the paper the new experimental results obtained coupling a single pixel to an 8 8 ASIC prototype are shown.

The pedestrians have a lot of difficulties in crossing as most of the drivers don’t care for the waiting pedestrians. Pedestrians are mainly exposed to the risk of traffic accident when crossing a street in urban areas [...] The crosswalks are the sites where the pedestrians leave the sidewalk and enter the roadway. In this case the path of the pedestrian crosses one of the cars. The pedestrian crosses safely if there are not cars or the driver detect him with sufficient time to stop his car. Often the drivers do not stop even if they detect the pedestrian next to crosswalk. A lot of drivers go at high speed also next to pedestrian crossing.
