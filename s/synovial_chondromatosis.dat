These nodules eventually break free and float around the joint space becoming larger - these add to the discomfort and stiffness of the joint.

We present a small case series and describe the clinical presentation, investigation, and treatment of patients with <b>synovial</b> <b>chondromatosis</b> who also had cam-type femoroacetabular impingement involving the same hip. Methods: Five patients (four men and one woman {{with a mean age}} of thirty-four years [range, thirty to thirty-seven years]) with unilateral <b>synovial</b> <b>chondromatosis</b> of the hip presented with clinical and radiographic features of ipsilateral cam-type femoroacetabular impingement.

40|$|Introduction. <b>Synovial</b> <b>chondromatosis</b> is {{a benign}} disease of {{synovial}} membrane usually affecting knee, elbow and shoulder joints. It rarely {{appears as a}} solitary formation and exceptionally within Hoffa’s fat pad. Case Report. We report a case of solitary <b>synovial</b> <b>chondromatosis</b> within Hoffa’s fat pad {{as a cause of}} its impingement in a female patient aged 63. At first, the patient had anterior knee pain with limited extension of the knee. Standard radiogram showed only mild patellofemoral osteoarthritic changes. Magnetic resonance of the knee showed ovoid solitary formation within Hoffa’s fat pad repressing its superior part between the kneecap and distal femur.

40|$|Abstract. Primary <b>synovial</b> <b>chondromatosis</b> is an uncommon, benign entity {{involving}} the synovial lining of larger joints. In this metaplastic process, islands of chondrocytes are clustered throughout the synovium, forming nodules that jut into the joint cavity. Clinical manifestations include pain, swelling, and decreased {{range of motion}} of associated extremities. <b>Synovial</b> <b>chondromatosis</b> may be confused with other degenerative joint diseases as well as chondrosarcoma. The occurrence of <b>synovial</b> <b>chondromatosis</b> in the spine is rare. Ten cases of this spinal variant have previously been published and this report represents the eleventh case.

40|$|<b>Synovial</b> <b>chondromatosis</b> is a {{cartilaginous}} metaplasia of the mesenchymal {{remnants of}} the synovial tissue of the joints.

The main symptoms are pain, limitation of jaw movement, crepitation, and inflammation. Diagnosis is made by panoramic radiograph, computed tomography scan, and mainly magnetic resonance imaging.
