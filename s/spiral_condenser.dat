50|$|A 150 mL, five-necked round-bottomed vessel is {{equipped}} with a mechanical stirrer, an air-cooledstraight condenser loosely packed with silanized glass wool, a solidsaddition funnel, a gas inlet tube extending into the reaction mixture, anda thermometer. The air condenser is connected laterally to the top entryof an efficient-jacketed <b>spiral</b> <b>condenser</b> cooled at −75 °C (dry ice/acetone); the bottom exit of this condenser is fitted to a two-ways fraction-collector adapter carrying two 50 mL receiving flasks, also cooledat −75 °C. In succession to the adapter, two cold traps are placed, thefirst cooled at −75 °C, and the second at liquid nitrogen temperature.The main vessel is charged with NaHCO3 (1.5 g) and Na2H2EDTA (0.5 g) dissolved in 15 mL of bidistilled water, and cooled at 2-5 °C. To this20 g (0.179 mol) of 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-propanone is added, andmechanical stirring is initiated. Solid potassium peroxomonosulfate(0.081 mol, 25 g of Curox triple salt) is quickly added (1-2 min) to thereaction vessel, while passing a gentle stream of He (or Ar) gas throughthe mixture. Just before starting the addition of the solid inorganicperoxide, a slight vacuum (650-700 mmHg) is applied to the last trap.Shortly after the addition is initiated, the end two-ways adaptor isswitched to insert the main collection flask, and during 6-8 min approximately 12mL of yellow solution of TFD in TFP is collected, having dioxirane concentrationsranging from 0.5 to 0.8 M; 1H NMR (CF3COCH3, Me4Si,−20 °C) 6 1.97 (s).|$|E
2500|$|A Friedrichs {{condenser}} (sometimes incorrectly {{referred to}} as [...] "Friedrich's" [...] <b>condenser),</b> a <b>spiraled</b> finger <b>condenser,</b> was invented by Fritz Walter Paul Friedrichs, who published a design {{for this type of}} condenser in 1912. It consists of a large, spiraled internal cold finger-type capillary tube disposed within a wide cylindrical housing. Coolant flows through the internal cold finger; accordingly, vapors rising up through the housing must pass along the spiraled path.|$|R
50|$|Otto Dimroth (28 March 1872 - 16 May 1940) was a German chemist. He {{is known}} for the Dimroth rearrangement, {{as well as a}} type of {{condenser}} with an internal double <b>spiral,</b> the Dimroth <b>condenser.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fritz Walter Paul Friedrichs (1882-1958) (also {{published}} as Fritz Friedrichs) was a German chemist. He invented the <b>spiral</b> cold finger-type <b>condenser,</b> now most {{commonly known as}} a Friedrichs condenser, which he described in a 1912 article published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.|$|R
