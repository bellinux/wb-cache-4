What happened with the song 'Talk' is that it was all going great and then someone said 'That should be the first single' and we all just freaked out and scrapped it all. [...] We’ve just mixed it and it <b>sounds</b> <b>great.</b> I think we’ve had such pain getting to that place, I’m not sure anyone quite knows {{what to do with it}} anymore. When we heard it mixed properly, it sounded mega." ...|$|E

Buchanan told Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian {{that she made}} advances towards the man, but {{he was unaware of}} her intentions: [...] "I really liked this guy, so I'd be like, there's this good movie coming out, you know, dropping hints. And he'd be like, that movie <b>sounds</b> <b>great,</b> let me know what it's like if you go see it. I knew he liked me too but he just wasn't getting what I was trying to say." [...] Austin advised Buchanan to tell the man to [...] "push that button" [...] or she would eventually move on.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, De Ravin {{was cast}} to portray Claire Littleton {{on the hit}} ABC drama Lost. Speaking about the success of Lost, she said: [...] "It's sort of hard to say. You read {{something}} {{and have a good}} feeling about it, it <b>sounds</b> <b>great,</b> ties nicely together and then shooting something, editing it, the music, the actors involved, everything sort of plays a huge part. Everyone involved had a great feeling towards it, but you never really know." [...] She was a series regular for the first four seasons and the sixth and final season. She was not a regular in season five but was under a holding contract with ABC Network.|$|E

500|$|An {{investigation}} by the New York Press asked a number of independent doctors about the evidence for the Purification Rundown. None of them endorsed the program's effectiveness and some explicitly described it as dangerous. Several said that no peer-reviewed research on the rundown had been published in any medical journal. Some apparently supportive studies have been published, but these lack control groups and have other scientific failings. According to Deputy Fire Commissioner Frank Gribbon, doctors investigating the program {{on behalf of the}} Fire Department concluded that it was not detoxifying. University of Georgia bioterrorism expert Cham Dallas also denied that the procedure could detoxify, saying [...] "It <b>sounds</b> <b>great</b> and they mean well, but it just doesn't work." ...|$|E
500|$|Kim Newman, {{writing for}} Empire in 2013, {{considered}} The Blues Brothers to be [...] "an amalgam of urban sleaze, automobile crunch and blackheart rhythm and blues" [...] with [...] "better music than any film had had for many years". He noted that Belushi and Akyroyd pack in their heroes: [...] "Aretha storming through 'Think', Cab Calloway cruising through 'Minnie the Moocher', John Lee Hooker boogying through 'Boom Boom' and Ray Charles on electric piano, {{not to mention}} the hottest band." [...] He observed that [...] "the picture had revived the careers of virtually all the musicians that appeared in it" [...] and concluded [...] "it still <b>sounds</b> <b>great</b> and looks as good as ever through Ray Bans".|$|E
500|$|It {{also makes}} use of piano keys and guitar strings. Rihanna's vocal range in the song spans from the lower note of G3 to the higher note of C5. Mackay noted that the singer adopts a [...] "melancholic pop vocal" [...] for the {{duration}} of the song. Chad Grischow of IGN stated that Rihanna appears to be screaming the vocals during the hook, citing the key of the [...] "jittery dance beat" [...] as the reason for oversinging. However, Grischow commented that the singer sounds more pleasant to listen to during the verses, writing: [...] "The song actually <b>sounds</b> <b>great</b> when the light, plucky verses are quietly building to the hook, allowing her to sing rather than shout." [...] Rihanna sings about the complications of a relationship, as well as how the protagonist can experience mood swings, whereby his or her feelings frequently change toward their lover.|$|E

500|$|... "Love Story" [...] was {{recorded}} in March 2008 at Blackbird Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, alongside record producer Nathan Chapman and various personnel. Swift sang into an Avantone CV-12 multi-pattern tube microphone, manufactured by Avant Electronics. The microphone had a new old stock tube that was designed and built by country singer, record producer, and audio engineer Ray Kennedy for Chapman. Chapman had received the microphone from Kennedy as a loan, as a [...] "try this for a while" [...] experiment. Although he previously had tested numerous microphones on Swift, {{he had not been}} able to find one to match her voice perfectly. When Swift came to Chapman's home to record a radio edit for one of the singles from Taylor Swift, she immediately grew fond of the microphone. [...] "When she put on the headphones and said, 'Test,' completely unprompted, she said, 'This is my mic. I love this mic. I just wanna use this one from now on!' She had no idea what it was, just loved it, and I went along with something that felt right for her. We've been using it ever since, and it <b>sounds</b> <b>great</b> on her voice," [...] Chapman said.|$|E

In September 1975, {{a few months before}} the album release in January, Dylan, with Rivera on violin, Stoner on bass and Wyeth on drums, performed Hurricane, Oh, Sister and Simple Twist of Fate for the PBS tribute to John Hammond recorded at the WTTW television studios in Chicago.|$|E

2500|$|Upon its release, The Face of Love was {{generally}} well-received by music critics. Jared Johnson of Allmusic gave a 4.5/5 review, praising Matt Hammit's lead vocals as [...] "so rich and mature {{that he could}} practically sing a computer owner's manual to rave reviews"; it was also labeled by Allmusic as an AMG Album Pick. The title track [...] "The Face of Love" [...] received individual accolade, as well: Jesus Freak Hideout main editor John DiBiase called it [...] "probably the band's best [...] to date", while Christianity Today {{said that it was}} a [...] "beautiful illustration". The album was noted to somewhat [...] "lack distinction" [...] by Christianity Today, however; the magazine's review noted, [...] "Based on the songwriting, this is Sanctus Real's most mature effort to date ... Though it all <b>sounds</b> <b>great,</b> there's ultimately something a little lacking ... hile there is indeed growth here, it doesn't necessarily make The Face of Love a step forward in excellence compared to the band's two previous efforts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon release, Sheila Prophet of Record Mirror {{felt the}} album was [...] "worth giving a spin" [...] and said: [...] "This is their {{comeback}} album - the one that'll make 'em or break 'em. It features [...] "Gypsy Roadhog" [...] {{and most of the}} other tracks are in the same vein - solid, rocking numbers, but just not quite distinctive enough {{to make it in the}} same way as [...] "Cum On Feel the Noize" [...] or [...] "Coz I Luv You" [...] did. Part of the problem is that they seem to be trying too hard - laying everything on, instead of sticking with simplicity. The result is that it sounds, heavy, cluttered, even, a bit old-fashioned. Noddy's voice still <b>sounds</b> <b>great,</b> and Dave turns in some pretty nifty guitar, but there's just too much of everything. In the old days, lyrics weren't too important to Slade, but now they're writing songs with meaning." [...] Pete Makowski of New Musical Express wrote: [...] "The band were always on form when they worked within the most basic of formats. Rock and Roll! This album is high energy on a primeval scale. It's got all the ball bustin' riffs you'll find nestling comfortably alongside yer ZZ Tops and Nugents. It's got the same suicidal pace of the Aerosmith Rocks album. It's packed with strong tunes, lotsa potential singles and the lyrical content is more interesting." [...] Tony Ciarochi of Fairbanks Daily News-Miner said: [...] "...their latest album definitely packs the kind of punch that would get that kind of reaction from a crowd of concert goers. Although it is fairly basic rock 'n' roll, the British humor and sarcasm with which it is presented make it a refreshing chance from some of the more bland sledgehammer rock grounds dominant in America." ...|$|E
