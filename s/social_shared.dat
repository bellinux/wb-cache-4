Most studies deal with <b>social</b> <b>shared</b> regulation focusing on collective individual regulations during collaboration and absence {{of one of these}} processes would affect mathematical problem solving during collaborative learning. This study contributes to the emerging research on <b>social</b> <b>shared</b> regulation in collaborative learning where collaborative groups are analyzed as the unit of analysis. Participants include 21 students who are learning mathematics at a vocational training institution in an online collaborative learning setting. Students' discussion scripts were collected and analyzed to identify the group strategies to regulate learning during solving Mathematics problem based on a coding scheme. Preliminary findings indicated that content-monitoring, content-evaluation and task-planning were the most frequent applied regulation strategies during online collaborative learning. Online collaborative learning results in socially shared regulation in groups however co-occurrence of self-, co- and shared regulation in online collaborative learning varies in relation to the type of regulation strategies implemented by the group. Future study should investigate on the ways to encourage all forms of regulation to co-occur during online collaborative learning. Also, investigation on the quality of socially shared regulation (based on acquisition of mathematical knowledge and content of discussion) during online collaborative learning in relation to group learning performances should be carried out...|$|E

In order {{to examine the effects of}} physician employment on work practices in the hospital, we collected 583 data points from 302 hospitals in 47 states in the USA to test two models; one for employed and another for non-employed physicians. Results show that information sharing and shared values among healthcare delivery professionals fully mediate the relationship between EMR use and physicians’ performance. Next, physician employment determines which mediating variable constitutes the pathway from EMR use to physicians’ performance. Finally, we highlight the impact of shared values between the hospital and physicians in enhancing information sharing and physicians’ performance, extending studies of these behaviors among network partners in industrial settings. Overall our study shows that EMR use should be complemented by processual (information sharing), <b>social</b> (<b>shared</b> values) and structural (physician employment) mechanisms to yield positive effects on physicians’ performance...|$|E

This paper is a case study that deals with the relation between discourse, discriminatory acts and biased ideology as reflected in Spanish and English written news. The approach used is critical discourse analysis (CDA) and the aimed outcome is the examination of a news item about female treatment on the labor market in Spain. It is the topic structure and the discursive strategies that are to be examined in order to detect if they succumbed to sexist prejudice: in other words, if they enact, perpetuate and even legitimize gender discrimination in the printed press. At the academic level, this study aims at contributing to further research, through the establishment of an evaluative framework from the critical vision about the role of discourse in (re) producing social inequality. Moreover, its goal is to promote a critical perspective for other social groups to control discourse properties, by taking a position and fighting against <b>social</b> <b>shared</b> biased models. Finally, it aims at revealing discourse principles in the contemporary media, {{as well as in the}} Spanish working contexts...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the discursive construction of Portuguese national identity, {{focusing on the}} many attempts to imagine and construct a national identity within the discourses produced for, on and from two events in the media: {{the anniversary of the}} 25 th of April revolution in 2004 and the European Football Championships 2004 (held in Portugal). These national public events triggered similar discursive topics about the country's recent history, collective memories and Portugal's relationship to other nations. This investigation applies interdisciplinary critical discourse analysis, namely the discourse-historical approach, and a triangulation of methods to examine written and spoken discourse in detail and also to investigate salient features of context whilst analysing three distinct datasets: 141 newspaper editorials and opinion articles on Euro 2004, 40 newspaper editorials and opinion articles on the thirtieth anniversary of the 1974 'Carnation Revolution', and a one-hour radio phone-in programme on the topic "Is (Portuguese) national identity in crisis?". The prime objective is to conceptualise and identify the various macro-strategies which stem from the macro-, meso- and micro-dimensions of an imagined identity employed in the discursive construction of Portuguese national identity, and to describe them. A key point is who, as a group, attains the political, social or symbolic power to shape, within the public sphere, what should be remembered and what should be forgotten, and whether these collective memories, which build in-group(s) of <b>social</b> <b>shared</b> narratives, compete or even collide with other narratives. The ultimate aim of this research project is to contribute to the body of knowledge about the contemporary Portuguese national identity discourses produced by the (political and cultural) elites who have privileged access to the media. At the same time, it introduces ways of questioning the homogeneity of national identity and expands the possible applications of critical discourse analysis approaches to the investigation of the hegemonic construction of (public) national identity discourses. Finally, the analytical chapters highlight how asymmetric access to the public sphere is reinforced by the discursive strategies that are present in the data.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the three year {{research}} project LUS “Living Urban Scape”, IUAV University of Venice and University of Roma Tre. The research is about urban regeneration applied at Italian social housing suburbs built between 1960 ’– 1980 ’ (De Matteis, 2010), when urban growth was often oversized and technicist, and when the “public city” (Di Biagi, 1986) had {{a central role in}} the process. These contexts are nowadays characterized by many social and physical problems that, in the age of sustainable cities (Leipzig charter, 2007) and economical crisis, are meant to be solved with effective low-cost and cooperative based strategies (Laboratorio Città Pubblica 2009; De Matteis & Norsa, 2011). By considering “everyday life” landscapes (European Landscape Convention, 2000) as an innovative paradigm that links urban & architectural scale, LUS investigate a form of regeneration that “uses” the two resources always present in the focused residential suburbs: -	Physical resource of transformable open space – “third landscape” (Clement, 2005), unfinished residual, missed public space, wasted and deteriorated land, overabundant standard surfaces… -	Social resource of local residents, who often, in order to get out from a marginal, depressed situation, spontaneously start local good practices of taking care and appropriation (illegal, too) on open spaces, so that sociable places, new uses and qualities can be created for local communities improvement (Aprile, 2010). LUS is an applied research that experiments participated methods and new design principle and strategies on case studies. It is here showed the “Raibosola Neighborhood” case study in Comacchio. Thanks to good synergies among different local stakeholders, LUS research group has started and conducted a participated process for analysis and urban design.

40|$|Working on my {{graduate}} thesis I {{started to}} study the important link between animal cruelty and interpersonal violence with the real hope to develop in my country, Italy, {{a new kind of}} education which will be able to develop in children the awareness of the importance to protect every form of life, both human and non human. Animals as victims are in the same position of women and children because they are in the group called “weak subjects”. Soon I realized that talking about an education approach to teach compassion toward animals in a country as Italy which also today it maintain a rural thought, will be hard. Many clues gave me an intuition: there is a social idea that only women and children can show sensibility toward animals and that the permanence of storical idea of virility in men prevents them to show empathy toward other living creatures. A violent person is violent against every subject weaker than him, because violence is not strenght, violence is an habitus and as habitus we have as educators the resources to change it and to improve the social appeal of some values: protection vs prevarication, care vs damage, real man vs violent man. My research confirmed my intuition about the need of construction of a <b>social</b> <b>shared</b> idea of a real and strong man as a man who is compassionate toward the weaker and who feel the moral imperative to protect the weaker, but also a man who is ready to fight for the good of a weaker life as animal life is. At this point it was useful {{to study the}} non violent philosophy and movement so I studied many non-violent authors and I find in their thoughts the idea of non-violence extended also to “non human animals”. From the interviews and bibliografical research I find the need (that society are showing) to built a new model of strong and desiderable person. Perpetrators of violence, in the major number of cases think that they are strong in abusing the weaker.   We need a new model of human being, and to develop it, we need education of new generation of boys and girls.  To realize this ideal human being it must starting from the childhood to teach respect, compassion and protection toward animals, {{this is the only way}} to develop the concept of “respect every kind of lives”.

40|$|To date, {{mainstream}} ‘traditional’ leadership {{research has}} concentrated on a leader-centred approach, assuming leader behaviour and abilities as the focal point, and, {{as a result}} overlooking the idea that everyone can enact and contribute to leadership. Typically these studies are situated within the business sector and have employed quantitative research methods focussing on the overt ‘leader’ with little recognition of stakeholder perspectives {{and the importance of}} context (Kihl, Leberman & Schull, 2010; Jackson & Parry, 2011). It is in more recent years that some scholars have begun to embrace a more all-encompassing view of leadership centring instead on the ‘informal’ ‘leadership’ view as opposed to the ‘formal’ ‘leader’ outlook (Jackson & Parry, 2011; Welty Peachey, Zhou, Damon & Burton, 2015). 	To contribute to this evolving body of leadership literature, predominantly that within the context of sport, this study sought to explore stakeholder perspectives of leadership in organisations within the New Zealand sport sector. More specifically, this overall aim was explored through the use of two guiding sub-questions: 1) what are selected individual stakeholder perspectives of leadership; and 2) what themes emerge from these perspectives that advance knowledge and understanding of leadership in the New Zealand sport sector? The social constructionist lens, viewing leadership as a relational, shared experience was adopted, also recognising the significant role context plays in leadership interactions (Foldy, Goldman & Ospina, 2008; Grint, 2005; Ospina & Schall, 2001). This social approach to understanding leadership coupled with the collaborative nature of sport itself and the lack of research in this area, validates the need to consider stakeholder perspectives of leadership within the sector. In order to gather this industry knowledge, a qualitative study was conducted incorporating a case study approach. Data were gathered from three individual stakeholders through semi-structured in-depth interviews resulting in rich, insightful sharing’s. These interviews revealed that among other leadership learnings such as the importance of developing people, understanding followers and building teams, the key emergent ideas are the importance of; self-awareness and emotional intelligence, developing and managing relationships, and the social, relational viewpoint of leadership. Overall this knowledge helps us to better understand the notion of leadership as a <b>social,</b> <b>shared</b> experience and contributes to enhancing our understanding of stakeholder perspectives of leadership within the New Zealand sport industry. In turn, these insights can be used to inform curriculum development of the leadership teachings in the Bachelor of Sport and Recreation at Auckland University of Technology, and help to enhance the development of students/graduates and their capabilities...|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the influence of western educational approaches upon non-western societies and cultural groups. In applying western educational approaches, often a detailed consideration of its consequences to the culture and heritage of a non-western civilization is neglected. This is both the case of a multicultural classroom where students come from different backgrounds and the case of homogeneous classroom in non-western countries where the western teaching and learning approaches are encouraged because they seem to bring higher academic achievement. The research further draws upon a case study that illustrates the application of Cooperative Learning, an educational method that was developed in a western context. Cautions have been raised, concerning diverse influential factors, one of them identified in this study as the cultural factor which refers to norms and values deeply embedded in the cultural niche and everyday’s life pattern of teachers and students, and to a certain extent may exert influence in how they perceive and practice CL. While we may agree that the roots of CL are extant in all cultures, because cooperation is essential to the functioning of human groups, we should acknowledge that different forms of CL are more likely to thrive in different cultures. This study is dedicated to explore the impact of a specific culture on CL process and outcomes by means of experimental research. The particular cultural reference in the study is focused on Asian Confucian Heritage Cultures, which are the cultures historically under the influence of Confucianism in the following countries: Viet Nam, China, Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Theoretical analyses conducted to examine what aspect of Asian-CHC specifically may influence CL and in what way reveal a number of domains where cultural conflicts and mismatch are likely to happen when the mainstream CL approaches are applied in Asian context without a rigorous adaptation to improve compatibility with the host culture in the following domains: Leadership; Face; Reward allocation; Group composition; Teacher-Student dyad; Gender; Learning style; and Attitude towards time. Two experimental settings were formed by randomisation. Vietnamese students in one setting received a series of lessons in which CL principles applied in domains of focus are associated with the mainstream CL theories and practice. Students in the other setting received similar lessons but CL in these lessons were modified so as to be more culturally appropriate. Findings show that there {{is likely to be a}} discrepancy in how Vietnamese students and the mainstream CL researchers perceive the impact of leadership, the justification of reward allocation, and the effectiveness of group composition based on affect-based trust and <b>social</b> <b>shared</b> identity. When CL was organised in ways that were considered to be culturally appropriate, students reported higher work rates than those who followed a traditional programme. This study links theory directly to practice by formulating nine concrete CL instructional design principles to be considered in curriculum and task design with Vietnamese students in particular, and Asian-CHC learners in general, as target group. Arguing that CL is not value-free, the study points out a challenge for educational leaders to balance the changing demands put on learners and teachers as a consequence of globalisation, while being sensitive to the equally important task of addressing the need to value the cultural context of learners and teachers...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} the {{research}} was on the manifestation of leadership that emerged in one district high school in Western Australia undergoing both imposed and self-determined change. Given the phenomena, which were deemed to involve complex human behaviour, {{a decision was made}} to locate the research within the naturalistic paradigm. The research was established in the “bounded case study” mode in which the school was regarded as an instant draw from a class within which issues would be discovered the described and studies in order to achieve understanding. A second district high school was used as a reference point from which developments in the case study school might be judged. A bounded case study of a second district high school as its school development plan was ratified by the district superintendent, was conducted. The school development plan was considered to be the product of the changes this school had undergone. A three phase research design was adopted in order to formulate research questions and procedures, undertake trialing and collect data. Data was collected by formal and informal interviews, direct observations and weekly three day visits to the case study school and periodic visits to the reference school. The Principal of the later school was used as an “external auditor” for the data analysis and interpretations. Data were analysed using a data content analysis system based upon a single frame of reference - interventions - and a preliminary categorization taxonomy developed as an initial conceptual framework. Data were ‘mapped” using two techniques based on chronologies of action and events (interventions) and leadership approach. Analysis of data indicated that the cultural difference between the secondary, upper primary and junior primary sections of district high schools should be taken into account when change is implemented in those schools. A clear and unambiguous definition of the tasks, functions and powers of district superintendents and principals of self-determining schools within the reform Ministry of Education should be developed so that conflicting understandings by Ministry of Education staff no longer exist. To develop a non-adversary relationship with principals, district superintendents should move from the use of legitimate and coercive power bases and use export and referent power. A system of professional support for principals, independent of the Ministry of Education hierarchy, should be implemented at Education District level. A principal need not exhibit all of the levels of leadership in the proportions suggested by Sergiovanni (1984) to aspire to be the principal of an excellent school, so long as the aggregate of the leadership behaviour in the school includes leadership in all levels, in the proportions suggested. In situations where individuals are permitted by peers to exercise leadership roles, their behaviour will not be consistent with that suggested by Sergiovanni (1984), as constituting excellent leadership. Effective leadership is fluid. As subordinates expectations vary, as they become more familiar with the task, an effective leader will monitor the situation and make fine adjustments to exert the necessary coordinations, control and motivation of staff. Individuals in leadership positions will vary their behaviour in response to situations where there is actual conflict or the potential for conflict. Individuals in leadership positions will vary their behaviour to accommodate changes in their perception of the flexibility of the task. The potential for conflict exists when the cultural situation changes. This conflict will, most often, be between “tribal” groups created on the bases of <b>social,</b> <b>shared</b> and vested interests. In cases where the tasks traditionally performed at executive or managerial levels, such as by deputy principals, the individuals at that level will be subject to diminished legitimate power and become without roles...|$|E

During this time, their conversation was recorded in order to analyze it for any manifestations of <b>social</b> <b>sharing.</b> In these studies, the duration of <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> was significantly higher in the intense emotion condition than in the non-emotional and moderate emotion conditions, and was the only condition in which <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> was substantial enough to justify calculating the individual contributions of targets and partners to the <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> process. Consistent with the hypothesis that a person exposed to an emotion would socially share it, targets contributed to the <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> component of the conversation to a much greater extent than did partners (81.8% and 18.2% of the time, respectively).|$|R
40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>Sharing</b> of Emotion (SSE) {{occurs when}} one person shares an {{emotional}} experience with another {{and is considered}} potentially beneficial. Though <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> has been shown prevalent in interpersonal communication, research on its occurrence and communication structure in online social networks is lacking. Based on a content analysis of blog posts (n = 540) in a blog social network site (Live Journal), we assess the occurrence of <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> in blog posts, characterize different types of online SSE, and present a theoretical model of online SSE. A large proportion of initiation expressions were found to conform to full SSE, with negative emotion posts outnumbering bivalent and positive posts. Full emotional SSE posts were found to prevail, compared to partial feelings or situation posts. Furthermore, affective feedback predominated to cognitive and provided emotional support, empathy and admiration. The study found evidence {{that the process of}} <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> occurs in Live Journal, replicating some features of face to face SSE. Instead of a superficial view of online <b>social</b> <b>sharing,</b> our results support a prosocial and beneficial character to online SSE...|$|R

40|$|Three {{experimental}} studies {{are reported in}} which we tested the prediction that negative emotion elicits the <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> of the emotional experience. In two experiments, participants arrived at the laboratory with a friend and then viewed one of three film excerpts (nonemotional, moderate emotion, or intense emotion) alone. Afterwards, the participants who saw the film {{had an opportunity to}} interact with the friend and their conversation was recorded. In both experiments participants who had seen the intense emotion excerpt engaged in significantly more <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> than did participants in the other two conditions. A third experiment extended the investigation to <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> in everyday life and replicated the previous results. Nonemotional explanations of the effects observed were also ruled out. Results are discussed {{in the context of the}} relation between emotional intensity and amount of <b>social</b> <b>sharing...</b>|$|R
