40|$|During {{the period}} 1898 - 1906 red romans Chrysoblephus laticeps {{dominated}} redfish landings at Strand and Hermanus, Republic of South Africa, ports subject to cool upwelling conditions. Red <b>stumpnoses</b> C. gibbiceps {{were the main}} species along the eastern Cape Peninsula and seventy-fours Polysteganus undulosus at most harbours east of Cape Agulhas. By the late 1970 's romans were dominant between Kalk Bay and Arniston and also important contributors else-where, but seventy-fours were only recorded in any significant quantities from Port Alfred. Interpretation of these trends is complicated by a lumping of catches, but {{the possibility of an}} environmental change favouring romans (cooler water) at the expense of seventy-fours (warmer water) cannot be discounted. Other marine forms having a biology associated with cooler waters have also increased along the southern Cape coast in recent years. Redfish resources at Gans Bay and Struts Bay are not currently overexploited, but provide a valuable source of remuneration for local fishermen when preferred target species are absent. Limited data collected in the Tsitsikamma Coastal National Park indicate that dageraad C. cristiceps populations could deteriorate rapidly if subjected to high fishing pressure. The contribution of dageraads to combined redfish landings is currently highest in areas of low exploitation...|$|E

40|$|St Lucia {{is one of}} {{the largest}} estuarine systems in Africa, and attracts {{thousands}} of anglers each year. Catch card data from the National Marine Linefish System for the years 1986 - 1999 were analysed to determine catch composition, catch per unit effort (cpue) and seasonality of catches by recreational anglers. Because not all anglers completed catch cards, estimates of total catch were made using additional data on the number of private boat outings, the number of boat trailers at boat slipways and the number of boats recorded entering the campsite gates during 1992 and 1993. In all, 27 fish families, constituting 55 species, were recorded by recreational anglers. Dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus, spotted grunter Pomadasys commersonnii, perch Acanthopagrus berda, Natal <b>stumpnose</b> Rhabdosargus sarba, springer Elops machnata and mini-kob Johnius dorsalis were the most prominent species caught in terms of numbers and mass. Catch rates expressed numerically (fish angler- 1 h- 1) peaked during the summer and early winter. However, in terms of mass, catch rates peaked during late winter and spring, when there were increased landings of large dusky kob. Fluctuations in cpue were linked to salinity and estuary mouth conditions (i. e. mouth closure). Despite annual fluctuations in cpue, regression analysis revealed an overall downward trend for the dominant species (dusky kob and spotted grunter) and a gradual increase for <b>stumpnose,</b> perch and springer, but with the exception of <b>stumpnose,</b> these trends were not significant. Socio-economic aspects of the fishery were also investigated by conducting an independent boat-angler survey. The value of the recreational fishery, in terms of accommodation and direct angler expenditure, was estimated to be in the region of R 9 million during 1992. Angler attitudes towards fishing regulations were positive and anglers generally had a good knowledge of the regulations for target species.

40|$|Conventional {{fisheries}} management approaches have been shown, in many instances, {{to have been}} ineffective in dealing with complex conservation concerns such as bycatch. Greater considerations for broader-scale and holistic approaches, as proposed by the 'Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries' (EAF) and the 'balanced harvesting approach', are beginning to challenge some of the negative misconceptions around bycatch, especially in small-scale fisheries. The need for a more holistic approach to {{fisheries management}}, particularly in small-scale fisheries, in South Africa is highlighted by its commitment to an EAF and the recent Small-Scale Fisheries Policy, for which the Marine living Resource Act of 1998 provides the legal framework to implement. The case study of the Olifants estuary small-scale traditional gillnet fishing community, located {{on the west coast}} of South Africa, provides a particularly relevant example of a complex fishery requiring a holistic approach. Current regulations prohibit the harvesting or retention of any bycatch species. Fisheries management worldwide and in South Africa, generally view gillnet fisheries as destructive, due to the occurrence of bycatch and {{the fact that many of}} these bycatch species are considered overexploited, which has led to numerous attempts over the years to phase out the Olifants gillnet fishery. The purpose of this study was to, firstly, use an EAF framework to contextualise the issue of bycatch in the Olifants gillnet fishery, and secondly, to identify the relative contributions of all fisheriy sectors to the four key selected linefish species caught as bycatch by the fishery. An extensive review and analysis of available secondary data, as well as primary data collected for this study, have estimated, with acknowledged limitations, the magnitude of the exploitation by all known fisheries of these species. Key information from small-scale fisher interviews and community-monitoring data highlight the capture rate of key linefish species by this fishery. This is echoed by recent landings for 2012 indicating the relative contribution of the national beache seine and gillnet fishery to the overall catch of (Elf [Pomatomus saltatrix] - 26. 94 %; Silver Kob [Argyrosomus inodorus] - 0. 88 %; White <b>Stumpnose</b> [Rhabdosargus globiceps] - 1. 05 % - excluding the recreational sector).

40|$|Based on {{detailed}} literature surveys, {{all available}} information about 70 priority species in South African linefishery {{has recently been}} compiled into individual species status reports. Major aspects covered in the report include: distribution, habitat, migration, fishery sectors targeting this species, biology and population dynamics, biological reference points, current status indicators, current regulations and research priorities. This poster uses Rhabdosargus sarba commonly known as Natal <b>stumpnose</b> as an example to illustrate {{the format of the}} status reports and to highlight areas where there are gaps in our knowledge. R. sarba is a sparid bream that is common in subtropical and tropical inshore waters and estuaries throughout the Indo-Pacific. It is fairly abundant in KwaZulu-Natal waters where juveniles and sub-adults are conspicuous members of estuarine fish communities. Past research on their biology has been focused on diet, food selectivity and habitat as well as some aspects of their reproductive biology. The status report for R. sarba revealed that little information is available on the age and growth of this species. Further, the status of the stock and biological reference points are unknown. These aspects are currently being addressed in a research project at ORI and progress will be indicated on the poster...|$|R
40|$|Information {{pertaining}} to the commercial availability of fish species in South Africa remains sparse, {{even though it is}} crucial for consumers to make informed purchasing decisions in favour of their own well being and the well being of the environment. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the most commonly available fish species in South Africa by means of surveys of restaurants (n = 215) and retail outlets (n = 200) and to assess the conservation statuses of the observed species. Furthermore, the processing states in which fish were mostly sold (fresh, frozen, whole or filleted) and the quality of information available to consumers on fish at the point of sale were evaluated. Kingklip was found to be the most commonly marketed fish species in restaurants, while hake was observed most frequently in retail outlets. More than 30 % of the observed species were of conservation concern and included, amongst others, kingklip, kabeljou (kob), east- and west coast soles and geelbek. Specially-protected, illegal-to-sell fish in South Africa, such as white steenbras, white musselcracker and Natal <b>stumpnose,</b> were marketed in restaurants and retail outlets. This study highlighted the poor ability of fish purveyors in South Africa to provide information on the identity, origin, production method and sustainability of fish being sold. Additionally, the labelling of many packaged fish products in retail outlets was in contravention with South African regulations. Poor vendor awareness, disparate naming practices and the highly processed nature of fishery products provide an opportunity for unintentional or deliberate mislabelling of fish in South Africa. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{recruitment}} of juvenile marine fishes into the Knysna and Swartvlei estuaries was monitored over 30 months using seine, scoop and cast nets. The relative abundance, seasonality {{and growth of}} the dominant species are presented, and includes the Cape <b>stumpnose</b> Rhabdosargus holubi, white steenbras Lithognathus lithognathus, blacktail Diplodus sargus, strepie Sarpa salpa, Cape moony Monodactylus falciformis, southern mullet Liza richardsonii, groovy mullet Liza dumerilii, striped mullet Liza tricuspidens, flathead mullet Mugil cephalus, freshwater mullet Myxus capensis and leervis Lichia amia. Information on a further 12 species is also provided. Recruitment of most fish species into the Swartvlei and Knysna estuaries reaches a peak during summer, which coincides with maximum food resource availability and corresponds {{to the time when}} systems along this section of the coast are often open to the sea. Artificial winter breaching of the Swartvlei mouth has occurred in the past, and has generally led to the premature closure of the system and loss of the ‘head’ of water needed for the summer opening. This type of mouth manipulation leads to reduced availability of estuarine nursery areas for marine fishes along the southern Cape coast. Comparisons between the {{recruitment of}} juvenile fishes into the Knysna and Swartvlei estuaries indicate that higher densities of most species were recorded in the former system. This is attributed mainly {{to the fact that the}} Knysna mouth is deep, permanently open, and has a strong marine influence when compared to the shallow, narrow and seasonally closed Swartvlei mouth. However, in a regional context both Knysna and Swartvlei are large, unpolluted systems, which serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish. On this basis alone, these contrasting estuarine systems should be allocated the highest possible conservation status. Rhodes University Libraries (Digitisation) ABBYY FineReader 1...|$|R
40|$|Estuaries {{serve as}} nursery areas {{for a large}} number of estuary-associated fish species. Some of these taxa also use river {{catchments}} as nursery areas. During the upstream migration of this latter group, the juveniles are prone to predation by native and alien predatory fish inhabiting the system. The rate of invasion of ecosystems by alien organisms can be directly linked to anthropogenic influences, including both intentional and unintentional introductions by alien organisms into new regions. The largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, is a facultative piscivorous fish that has been successfully introduced worldwide for the main purpose of sport fishing. Where introduced, it has been found to negatively impact native fish and invertebrate species through predation, competitive exclusion and displacement of indigenous fish species. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the predatory impact of largemouth bass on the estuary-associated Cape moony Monodactylus falciformis, Cape <b>stumpnose</b> Rhabdosargus holubi and freshwater mullet Myxus capensis in the lower Kowie River of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. A combination of approaches was employed during this study. Stomach contents, stable isotopes and fatty acid analyses were employed for the reconstruction of the diet of largemouth bass. Acoustic telemetry was used to elucidate largemouth bass movements, particularly their ability to enter {{the upper reaches of the}} Kowie Estuary. Stomach contents and stable isotopes analyses showed that M. salmoides exhibit an ontogenic shift in diet, with small and medium sized individuals consuming the higher proportion of fish prey, while large sized individuals mostly consumed invertebrates such as crabs (Potamonautes sidneyi) and Odonata larvae, while consuming only a small proportion of estuary-associated fish. Fatty acid analysis only showed a direct connection between the fatty acid profiles of largemouth bass and those of M. capensis and M. falciformis. The acoustic telemetry results indicated that some M. salmoides individuals periodically move into the upper reaches of the estuary following river flood events. The results obtained from all these approaches highlight the risk posed by largemouth bass introductions on indigenous fish species, particularly those that enter the areas occupied by these top predators...|$|R
40|$|The ichthyofaunal {{community}} structure, {{population dynamics}} and movement {{patterns in the}} small temporarily open/closed (TOCE) Grant’s Valley estuary, situated along the Eastern Cape coastline, were investigated over the period May 2004 to April 2005. Community structure in the littoral zone was assessed, while growth of selected ichthyofaunal species was investigated using the MULTIFAN model. Population size was assessed using mark recapture models and movement within the estuary using the Hilborn (1990) model. Total ichthyofaunal densities and biomass within the littoral zone ranged between 0. 31 to 21. 45 fish m⁻² and 0. 20 to 4. 67 g wwt m⁻², with the highest values typically recorded during the summer. Results of the study indicated that the ichthyofaunal community structure within the estuary was {{closely linked to the}} mouth phase and the establishment of a link to the marine environment via overtopping events. In the absence of any link to the sea, the ichthyofaunal community was numerically dominated by estuarine resident species, mainly Gilchristella aestuaria and to a lesser extent, by the river goby, Glossogobius callidus which collectively comprised ca. 88 % of all fish sampled. The establishment of the link to the marine environment contributed to an increased contribution of marine breeding species (e. g. Rhabdosargus holubi, Myxus capensis and Atherina breviceps) to the total ichthyofaunal abundances. In contrast, total ichthyofaunal biomass was almost always dominated by marine breeding species by virtue of their larger sizes. Results of hierarchical cluster analyses did not identify any spatial patterns in the ichthyofaunal community within the littoral zone. Results of MULTIFAN analysis indicated estuarine resident fish species bred over an extended period with peaks occurring in the summer months. Conversely, marine breeding fish were shown to recruit into the estuary following overtopping and breaching events. Results of the mark-recapture experiment indicated a population of ca. 12 000 (11 219 – 13 311) individuals greater than 50 mm SL. Marine-breeding species (R. holubi, Monodactylus falciformis, and two mullet species) numerically dominated the ichthyofauna, possibly {{as a result of their}} effective use of overtopping events. The two mullet species, M. capensis and Liza richardsonii, and the Cape <b>stumpnose,</b> R. holubi moved extensively throughout the estuary, while the remaining species exhibited restricted movement patterns possibly due to the preference for refuge and foraging areas associated with reed beds. The observed movement patterns of individual fish species appeared to be associated with both foraging behaviour and habitat selection...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Sustainable {{diversification}} and {{the biological}} viability of selected aquaculture species are now {{viewed as being}} crucial factors that must be assessed in order to introduce the candidate species into commercial production. The biological feasibility of white <b>stumpnose,</b> Rhabdosargus globiceps,as a potential aquaculture candidate, was assessed by examining {{the ability of the}} broodstock to be manipulated to spawn in captivity and the viability of the larvae from 0 days post hatch (DPH) to 30 DPH under varied conditions. These factors are recognised as the most significant bottlenecks of development for a potential aquaculture candidate. A compressed photothermal cycle successfully brought about the reproductive maturation of both male and female broodstock. The natural, seasonal reproduction cycle, of the population of Rhabdosargus globiceps in Langebaan Lagoon, and manipulated cycles were comparable with regard to oocyte maturation. Under the compressed cycle an increase in the plasma estradiol 17 ß concentration correlated with the increase in oocyte diameter and the presence of late vitellogenic and hydrated oocytes. Reproductively mature broodstock were injected twice with LH-RHa on a 24 hour interval, which successfully induced spawning over four consecutive 24 hour periods. This method of manipulation and induction of spawning was successful twice and the resultant eggs and larvae were used to examine the ontogeny and the optimal rearing temperature of Rhabdosargus globiceps. In the first larval rearing experiment the stages of development from egg to 30 DPH larvae were recorded at 20 °C and showed similar developmental stages as other sea bream aquaculture species. The developmental stages were noted as being highly influenced by the available food sources with elevated mortalities recorded during the transitional phase between endogenous food reserves and exogenous feeding. The growth pattern showed the same reduced growth present for other successfully cultured sea bream larvae, suggesting that first feeding and swimbladder inflation was relatively successful. At 30 DPH the larvae reached a mean total length of 11. 14 ± 0. 44 mm. To determine the optimal rearing temperature and the effect of temperature on embryonic development eggs were placed at three different incubation temperatures (25 °C, 20 °C and 15 °C) and the timing to the developmental stages was recorded from 0 DPH to 30 DPH. Measurements indicated that the larvae reached and exceeded their thermal tolerance at 25 °C, with larvae only surviving to 6 DPH at this temperature, while at 20 °C the larvae had better growth, and significantly earlier indications and higher percentages of feeding, swimbladder inflation and notochord flexion than at 15 °C. The results suggest that the highest quality larvae are achieved at a rearing temperature of 20 °C. This thesis describes the induction of spawning and larval rearing of Rhabdosargus globiceps. The ontogeny of the larvae as well as the critical stages of first feeding, swimbladder inflation and notochord flexion are discussed and described in detail. Overall, the life cycle from adult to juvenile was successfully closed and the experiments showed very positive results regarding Rhabdosargus globiceps’ biological capacity and feasibility to become a potential aquaculture candidate in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the marine {{environment}} genetic studies allow insight into behaviour and natural history that is difficult or impossible to identify by direct field observation. Current as well as historical population demography and gene flow can be detected by using molecular techniques. Genetic studies on only a few commercially important marine species along the South African coast have been conducted, although many marine fish species utilize estuaries as nursery areas and little attention has been afforded to studying larval distribution and recruitment of these species from a molecular point of view. Many of these estuarine associated species, especially in the South African milieu, are important for recreational and subsistence use. Associated with southern African estuaries are 13 species of the family Sparidae of which Cape <b>stumpnose</b> Rhabdosargus holubi is the most abundant. Juveniles are mostly confined to estuaries while the adults are strictly marine. Rhabdosargus holubi are serial spawners but temporally separated spawning peaks have been recorded along the South African coastline. Within the first part of this dissertation, the general characteristics of marine fish populations and the marine environment along the South African coast are being discussed. The main aim of this study was to determine the population genetic structure from estimates of nuclear and mitochondrial genetic variation across the distributional range of Rhabdosargus holubi. Samples were collected from 13 geographic localities along the South African coastline from St Lucia in the northeast to Klein River in the southwest. Juveniles were sampled in estuaries and adults were collected in the marine intertidal zone. Mitochondrial DNA control region fragments of 368 bp in length were obtained from a total of 214 individuals from all sampling localities. A total of 36 alleles were identified from 34 polymorphic sites. Following an allele homogeneity test, samples from different localities were lumped to represent six distinct geographical regions. Mitochondrial DNA control region analyses of juveniles showed high haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity with no divergent maternal lineages. No pattern between haplotype genealogy and geographic locality was evident. Population genetic analyses using heterologous microsatellite amplification have been successfully completed for a number of studies, including numerous studies of variation within marine fish species. Microsatellite studies have proven to be more sensitive in detecting subtle population structure than mtDNA and/or protein polymorphisms in high gene flow species. A total of 113 microsatellite loci previously isolated from phylogenetically closely related marine fish species were tested for amplification. The success rate of heterologous microsatellite amplification was extremely low (0. 02 %), with only two polymorphic loci amplifying consistently for analysing 133 individuals sampled from six localities along the distributional range of R. holubi. Results from these two loci were insufficient to draw conclusions about the population genetic structure of R. holubi along the South African coast. Possible reasons for the low rate of amplification success and future research recommendations are discussed. The findings from this study suggest that R. holubi is not geographically restricted, has high gene flow among localities and likely exist as a single stock.

40|$|Temporarily open/closed {{estuaries}} (TOCEs) are {{the dominant}} estuary type in South Africa. These systems are often characterized by extensive beds of submerged macrophytes, which form important foraging and shelter habitats for fishes, especially for estuary-dependent fish {{species such as}} the Cape <b>stumpnose</b> Rhabdosargus holubi and Cape moony Monodactylus falciformis that are commonly associated with them. A loss of submerged macrophytes from an estuary {{has been shown to}} affect the fish community as well as reducing overall system productivity. The TOC East Kleinemonde Estuary, situated in the warm-temperate biogeographic region of South Africa has been subject to an ongoing long-term fish monitoring project since 1995. During the period 1995 to 2002, this estuary contained large beds of the submerged macrophytes Ruppia cirrhosa and Potamogeton pectinatus. However, subsequent to a major flood event in 2003 these macrophytes have been largely absent from this system. The effect of the loss of submerged macrophytes on the East Kleinemonde fish assemblage was investigated through an analysis of seine and gill net catch data. Seine net catches for a 12 year period, encompassing six years of macrophyte presence and six years of macrophyte senescence, revealed changes in the relative abundance of certain fish species. Vegetation-associated species such as R. holubi and M. falciformis decreased in abundance whereas sediment-associated species, especially members of the family Mugilidae, increased in abundance following loss of the macrophytes in this estuary. The critically endangered pipefish Syngnathus watermeyeri was only recorded in catches during years in which macrophyte beds were present. In addition to the analysis of catch data, the importance of macrophytes as a primary energy source for selected estuarine fishes was explored through the analysis of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes. Prior to conducting these analyses, common methodological practices to address the presence of carbonates and lipids within isotope samples were evaluated. A subset of samples were either acid washed to remove carbonates, or lipids were removed according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (1959) as both of these compounds have been shown to affect stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. The suitability of the lipid normalization models of Fry (2002) and Post et al. (2007) for samples of estuarine fish muscle were also tested. Based on this evaluation both models are suitable for use with estuarine fish muscle tissue, however since neither carbonate nor lipid content of any of the samples used in this study was high all samples were left untreated in the following analysis. Carbon isotope ratios {{from a wide range of}} fish species collected from the East Kleinemonde Estuary during the macrophyte-senescent phase were compared with individuals of the same species from the neighbouring West Kleinemonde Estuary (where extensive beds of R. cirrhosa and P. pectinatus were present) and revealed the influence of submerged macrophyte material in the diet of fishes in the latter system. However, it was apparent that these plants are not directly consumed but rather contribute to the detrital pool that forms a food source for most invertebrate and some fish species. The most significant source of carbon for East Kleinemonde fishes during the macrophyte senescent phase appeared to have a more depleted origin; probably from benthic or pelagic microalgae. In conclusion, while the importance of macrophyte beds as shelter and foraging habitats for estuarine fishes are well documented, their role in terms of the structuring and functioning of fish assemblages in TOCEs remains somewhat uncertain. The findings of this study were possibly masked by the resilience of vegetation-associated species to the loss of this habitat, as well as by life history characteristics of species such as R. holubi that allow their numerical dominance despite habitat change. Nonetheless, macrophyte senescence in the East Kleinemonde Estuary resulted in the loss of at least one species and the reduced abundance of vegetation-associated species, probably reflective of reduced food resources and/or increased vulnerability to predation. As a result, beds of submerged macrophytes are an important habitat within TOCEs. ...|$|R
40|$|A fishery-dependant {{monitoring}} method of the recreational shore-based fishery was {{undertaken in the}} Goukamma Marine Protected Area (MPA) on the south coast of South Africa {{for a period of}} 17 months. The method used was a roving creel survey (RCS), with dates, times and starting locations chosen by stratified random sampling. The MPA was divided into two sections, Buffalo Bay and Groenvlei, and all anglers encountered were interviewed. Catch and effort data were collected and catch per unit effort (CPUE) was calculated from this. The spatial distribution of anglers was also mapped. A generalized linear model (GLM) was fitted to the effort data {{to determine the effects of}} month and day type on the variability of effort in each section. Fitted values showed that effort was significantly higher on weekends than on week days, in both sections. A total average of 3662 anglers fishing 21 428 hours annually is estimated within the reserve with a mean trip length of 5. 85 hours. Angler numbers were higher per unit coastline length in Buffalo Bay than Groenvlei, but fishing effort (angler hours) was higher in Groenvlei. Density distributions showed that anglers were clumped in easily accessible areas and that they favored rocky areas and mixed shores over sandy shores. Catch documented between October 2008 and December 2009 included a total of 361 fish, of 27 species from 12 families. Sparidae had the highest contribution (12 species). A Shannon-Weiner diversity index showed that diversity was higher in Buffalo Bay (0. 81) than Groenvlei (0. 57). Catch composition of retained fish (336 individuals) showed that the six numerically most important species were blacktail (Diplodus sargus capensis) (66 percent of catch), followed by galjoen (Dichistius capensis) at 11 percent, Cape <b>stumpnose</b> (Rhabdosargus holubi), belman (Umbrina robinsonii) and strepie at 3 percent, and elf (Pomatomus saltatrix) at 2 percent. Catch composition of an earlier study in Goukamma (Pradervand and Hiseman 2006) was compared with the present study, as well as data from the De Hoop MPA, which is closed to fishing. A multi-dimensional scaling plot of catch composition showed tight clustering of the De Hoop samples, and high variability among the Goukamma samples. A bray-curtis similarity index and dendrogram of similarity between study sites and study periods showed that there was an 83 percent similarity among De Hoop samples and a 75 percent similarity among Goukamma samples (ignoring the two outliers). The two sites are different with respect to species composition, but this is expected because they are different areas. Differences between time periods in Goukamma (i. e. the previous study versus the present study) were not significant. The most significant result from the catch composition analyses is the high variability among the Goukamma samples. This can be explained by the variable fishing methods used by anglers in Goukamma, compared with the standardized fishing methods used by researchers in De Hoop, and the fact that fish are more abundant and populations are more stable in De Hoop – giving higher sample sizes which reduce the variability in the statistics. Species-specific CPUE was calculated for the six numerically most important species. In both sections, CPUE was highest for blacktail, with an average of 0. 133 fish per hour for Groenvlei, and 0. 060 fish per hour for Buffalo Bay, over the 12 months. The second highest CPUE values per section were 0. 030 for galjoen in Groenvlei and 0. 039 for strepie in Buffalo Bay. Remaining CPUE values ranged from 0. 014 (belman in Groenvlei) to the lowest value of 0. 001 (strepie in Groenvlei). Total estimated CPUE for these six species in the MPA using the estimated effort and catch results amounted to 0. 018 fish per hour. An annual estimated 3897 fish were landed in the reserve during 2009. Most fish (n= 2481, 64 percent) were caught in the Groenvlei section. Numbers of blacktail were the highest of all species, within both sections (2353 fish). Strepie was the next most common (561 fish), but was caught almost entirely within the Buffalo Bay section (97 percent of individuals), followed by galjoen (548 fish) caught mostly within the Groenvlei section (92 percent of individuals). Size comparisons of the six species between the Goukamma and De Hoop MPAs showed that ranges in size are similar, but there are substantial differences in mean sizes between the two MPAs. Sample sizes of all species from the Goukamma MPA were too small to draw conclusions about stock status, except for blacktail. The Goukamma MPA is a popular fishing destination and angler effort is high. It can be considered a node of exploitation for surf zone fish, for which it provides no protection. Even though the MPA allows shore angling, sustainable fishing practices should be incorporated in management plans if the MPA is expected to protect and conserve its stocks. Of noteworthy concern is the occurrence of illegal night fishing (the public may not enter the reserve between sunrise and sunset) which leads to underestimates of catch and effort (night surveys were not conducted because of safety concerns). It is recommended that more communication should take place between the angling community and the reserve management. Sign boards giving information on species which are under pressure, and why they are under pressure, with a short explanation on their life cycles, is advised. The roving creel survey method was suitable for the study area and delivered statistically rigorous results. I thus recommend that it is continued in the future by management. I make some recommendations for reducing costs of future surveys, as well as for altering the survey design if funds are very limite...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{interpretation}} of recent variability observed in fish populations, species compositions, distribution ranges or ecological indicators, depends on {{knowledge of their}} past dynamics and historical states. The onset of systematic fisheries data collection typically lagged decades or even centuries behind modern fishing exploits. As a consequence, pre-disturbed reference points and descriptions of subsequent change are rarely available. A remarkably detailed set of historical trawl survey data from South Africa provided such a rare opportunity. Government-funded exploration of the Agulhas Bank fishery potential resulted in meticulously-documented trawl survey data from 1897 - 1904, when prior human impacts on those resources were negligible. Although they used less effective technology, the information recorded and methods used were similar to modern surveys. This thesis investigated change in demersal fish fauna of the Agulhas Bank and documents comparisons between historical trawl surveys and modern re-enactments at the same locations. In comparing trawl survey catches over multiple decades or among different periods, unquantified changes in fishing power pose a key challenge. The shape, size, materials, mesh sizes and speed at which trawl nets are dragged, interact with the behaviour, {{size and shape of}} fish, influencing fishing performance. To accurately compare current catch rates with those of historical trawl surveys, the same trawl gear and methods were carefully replicated in repeat surveys at three sites. An investigation of literature and photographs of the original vessel and equipment were conducted to support the construction of a replica 'Granton' otter trawl net. The net was composed of Manila hemp with a headline length of 27 m (90 ft) and was attached to flat wooden trawl boards. The historical towing speed was estimated as 1. 34 m s⁻¹ (2. 6 knots). Three parts of the shallow Agulhas Bank that were surveyed 111 years prior, were re-surveyed in 2015. Species composition was contrasted between the historical and re-survey periods by way of unconstrained ordination, permutational multivariate analysis of variance and tests of the homogeneity of multivariate group dispersions. Taxa discerning between periods were identified with similarity percentage analyses. Changes of standardised catch between periods were tested for 27 taxa, using a non-parametric bootstrap approach. Proportions among size-classes, recorded for three taxa, were tested using Fisher's exact test. Results revealed a substantially transformed demersal catch assemblage, where the period effect explained almost half of the measured variance among samples. These changes included the disappearance or heavy depletion of kob (Argyrosomus spp., absent in re-surveys), panga (Pterogymnus laniarius; 2. 4 % of historical catch abundance) and east coast sole (Austroglossus pectoralis; 4. 6 % of historical catch abundance), which had jointly contributed 70 - 84 % of historical catch composition. Average re-survey catches were largely made up of gurnards (Chelidonichthys spp.; 3 792 % of historical abundance), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus; 4 738 % of historical abundance), spiny dogfish (Squalus spp.; 3 121 % of historical abundance), hake (Merluccius capensis; 558 % of historical abundance) and white sea catfish (Galeichthys feliceps; 13 863 % of historical abundance). Analysis of available length information confirmed the expectation that fish sizes (specifically M. capensis and A. pectoralis) had declined. This implies that comparisons by weight would be more severe for declined abundances and less severe for those that increased, relative to contrasts of numerical abundance. Habitat preferences as well as geographic and depth distribution appeared to separate the taxa that increased from those that declined. These factors, together with reproductive and growth characteristics, as well as indirect trophic impacts, likely shaped the responses of demersal fauna to fishing and other human impacts during the 111 years between trawl surveys. An assessment of distribution changes of 44 common demersal taxa was undertaken. These analyses were restricted to the last 30 years of trawl survey data as the units and spatio-temporal resolution of prior data were incompatible. Standardised catches were used from annual spring and autumn south coast trawl surveys conducted by the government fisheries department. Geostatistical delta-generalised linear mixed models were used to predict species distribution functions, which were used to calculate annual estimates of latitude/longitude centres of gravity and effective areas occupied by each population. Average trends over the study period (1986 - 2016) were assessed using a Bayesian state-space model. Of nine species found to have a trend in average location, six moved westward or south-westward, while three moved eastward or north-eastward. Two species showed a trend of contracting spatial extent and one showed an expansion. Across the entire assemblage combined, there was a significant contraction in extent and a westward shift in average location. These assemblage-wide average trends are interpreted to be driven by climate forcing. Fishing impacts are expected to have contributed to the eastward movement in centre of gravity for kob, lesser sandshark (Rhinobatos annulatus) and white <b>stumpnose</b> (Rhabdosargus globiceps). Interpretation of these distribution shifts is hampered by a lack of knowledge on subsurface hydrographic trends on the Agulhas Bank, which is identified as a research priority. My research revealed substantial change in demersal fish communities on South Africa's Agulhas Bank and adds novel insight to the history underlying current states of demersal ecosystems. Valuable additions include a) documentation {{of the extent to which}} demersal assemblages have transformed during the last century at three representative inshore sites; b) estimates of current abundances relative to pre-disturbed baselines at those sites, which c) highlights drastic local depletion for certain taxa and d) reveals substantial abundance increases of certain species during the post-industrial fishing period; e) novel evidence of distribution trends in south coast demersal species; and f) identification of trends in the average distribution of the demersal fish assemblage, suspected to be climate-forced. Long-term comparisons, using minimally-disturbed baselines, revealed drastic transformation of the fish assemblage during a century of industrialisation, which points to trawling-induced alteration of benthic habitats and substantial changes in ecosystem structure. Besides the provision of novel historical context for current and future studies and decision-making, this work counters the erosive nature of shifting baselines in South Africa's marine environment...|$|R
