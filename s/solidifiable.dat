It is now generally agreed among geologists that the Earth was at first a mass of molten matter; and that it is still fluid and incandescent at the distance of a few miles beneath its surface. Originally, then, it was homogeneous in consistence, and, in virtue of the circulation that takes place in heated fluids, must have been comparatively homogeneous in temperature; and it must have been surrounded by an atmosphere consisting partly of the elements of air and water, and partly of those various other elements which assume a gaseous form at high temperatures. That slow cooling by radiation which is still going on at an inappreciable rate, and which, though originally far more rapid than now, necessarily required an immense time to produce any decided change, must ultimately have resulted in the solidification of the portion most able to part with its heat--namely, the surface. In the thin crust thus formed we have the first marked differentiation. A still further cooling, a consequent thickening of this crust, and an accompanying deposition of all <b>solidifiable</b> elements contained in the atmosphere, must finally have been followed by the condensation of the water previously existing as vapour. A second marked differentiation must thus have arisen: and as the condensation must have taken place on the coolest parts of the surface--namely, about the poles--there must thus have resulted the first geographical distinction of parts. To these illustrations of growing heterogeneity, which, though deduced from the known laws of matter, may be regarded as more or less hypothetical, Geology adds an extensive series that have been inductively established. Its investigations show that the Earth has been continually becoming more heterogeneous in virtue of the multiplication of the strata which form its crust; further, that it has been becoming more heterogeneous in respect of the composition of these strata, the latter of which, being made from the detritus of the older ones, are many of them rendered highly complex by the mixture of materials they contain; and that this heterogeneity has been vastly increased by the action of the Earth's still molten nucleus upon its envelope, whence have resulted not only a great variety of igneous rocks, but the tilting up of sedimentary strata at all angles, the formation of faults and metallic veins, the production of endless dislocations and irregularities. Yet again, geologists teach us that the Earth's surface has been growing more varied in elevation--that the most ancient mountain systems are the smallest, and the Andes and Himalayas the most modern; while in all probability there have been corresponding changes in the bed of the ocean. As a consequence of these ceaseless differentiations, we now find that no considerable portion of the Earth's exposed surface is like any other portion, either in contour, in geologic structure, or in chemical composition; and that in most parts it changes from mile to mile in all these characteristics.|$|E

It is now generally agreed among geologists and physicists that the Earth was at one time a mass of molten matter. If so, it was at that time relatively homogeneous in consistence, and, in virtue of the circulation which takes place in heated fluids, must have been comparatively homogeneous in temperature; and it must have been surrounded by an atmosphere consisting partly of the elements of air and water, and partly of those various other elements which are among the more ready to assume gaseous forms at high temperatures.

Yet again, geologists teach us that the Earth's surface has been growing more varied in elevation--that the most ancient mountain systems are the smallest, and the Andes and Himalayas the most modern; while in all probability there have been corresponding changes in the bed of the ocean. As a consequence of these ceaseless differentiations, we now find that no considerable portion of the Earth's exposed surface is like any other portion, either in contour, in geologic structure, or in chemical composition; and that in most parts it changes from mile to mile in all these characters. Moreover, there has been simultaneously going on a differentiation of climates. As fast as the Earth cooled and its crust solidified, there arose appreciable differences in temperature between those parts of its surface more exposed to the sun and those less exposed. As the cooling progressed, these differences became more pronounced; until there finally resulted those marked contrasts between regions of perpetual ice and snow, regions where winter and summer alternately reign for periods varying according to the latitude, and regions where summer follows summer with scarcely an appreciable variation. At the same time the many and varied elevations and subsidences of portions of the Earth's crust, bringing about the present irregular distribution of land and sea, have entailed modifications of climate beyond those dependent on latitude; while a yet further series of such modifications have been produced by increasing differences of elevation in the land, which have in sundry places brought arctic, temperate, and tropical climates to within a few miles of one another. And the general outcome of these changes is, that not only has every extensive region its own meteorologic conditions, but that every locality in each region differs more or less from others in those conditions; as in its structure, its contour, its soil. Thus, between our existing Earth, the phenomena of whose crust neither geographers, geologists, mineralogists, nor meteorologists have yet enumerated, and the molten globe out of which it was evolved, the contrast in heterogeneity is extreme.|$|E

Assuming that the permeability (K∗) of the porous medium {{is a function of}} the gel concentration (c∗), we determine a number of exact solutions corresponding to the cases where the concentration-dependent permeability is either arbitrary or has a power law variation or is a constant. Each case admits a number of distinct Lie symmetries and the solutions corresponding to the optimal systems are determined. Some typical concentration and pressure profiles are illustrated and a specific moving boundary problem is solved and the concentration and pressure profiles are displayed...|$|E
40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} aims {{to develop}} functional substitutes for damaged or diseased tissues through complex constructs of living cells, bioactive molecules and three-dimensional porous scaffolds, which support cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation. Such constructs can be formed either by seeding cells within a pre-formed scaffold or through injection of a <b>solidifiable</b> precursor and cell {{mixture to the}} defective tissue. As cell and bioactive molecule carriers, injectable scaffolds are appealing, particularly from the clinical point of view, because they offer the possibility of homogeneously distributing cells and molecular signals throughout the scaffold and can be injected directly into cavities, even of irregular shape and size, in a minimally invasive manner. In this paper the challenges in designing an injectable scaffold {{from the viewpoint of}} materials chemistry and the solidification mechanisms of injectable precursors are discussed. The applications of injectable scaffolds in angiogenesis, bone repair and cartilage regeneration are described...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} novel photo-polymerization {{technique}} of well-defined three-dimensional (3 D) layer-by-layer structures by two-photon absorption (TPA) in resins. By changing the structural parameters {{such as the}} rod diameter, pitch (intra-rod distance in plane) and angular orientation between neighbor planes different lattice types can be accomplished. This enables a systematic investigation of optical properties of photonic crystals (PhCs) made by TPA photo-polymerization. The solidified skeleton of PhC can be utilized as a mold to infiltrate <b>solidifiable</b> dye. Selective removal of the solidified resin can yield in a reverse PhC structures. When the defect-layer(s) are introduced into PhC during fabrication the PhC may act as a high-quality microcavity. A defect mode has been observed {{for the first time}} in thus-fabricated structures. Laser-microexplosion fabrication is another promising technique for the PhC and optical memory applications. To achieve an opening of a full-bandgap the media of high dielectric constant is of request (a high dielectric contrast is necessary) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPhospholipid films can be {{preserved}} in vitro when adsorbed to a <b>solidifiable</b> hypophase. Suspensions of natural surfactant, lipid extract surfactants, and artificial surfactants {{were added to}} a sodium alginate solution and filled into a captive bubble surfactometer (CBS). Surfactant film was formed by adsorption to the bubble of the CBS for functional tests. There were no discernible differences in adsorption, film compressibility or minimal surface tension on quasi-static or dynamic compression for films formed in {{the presence or absence}} of alginate in the subphase of the bubble. The hypophase-film complex was solidified by adding calcium ions to the suspension with the alginate. The preparations were stained with osmium tetroxide and uranyl acetate for transmission electron microscopy. The most noteworthy findings are: (1) Surfactants do adsorb to the surface of the bubble and form osmiophilic lining layers. Pure DPPC films could not be visualized. (2) A distinct structure of a particular surfactant film depends on the composition and the concentration of surfactant in the bulk phase, and on whether or not the films are compressed after their formation. The films appear heterogeneous, and frequent vesicular and multi-lamellar film segments are seen associated with the interfacial films. These features are seen already upon film formation by adsorption, but multi-lamellar segments are more frequent after film compression. (3) The rate of film formation, its compressibility, and the minimum surface tension achieved on film compression appear to be related to the film structure formed on adsorption, which in turn is related to the concentration of the surfactant suspension from which the film is formed. The osmiophilic surface associated surfactant material seen is likely important for the surface properties and the mechanical stability of the surfactant film at the air–fluid interface...|$|E
