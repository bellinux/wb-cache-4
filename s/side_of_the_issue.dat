25|$|But {{less than}} a decade later, the {{shifting}} winds of societal mores found Swartzendruber on the opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> In November 2013, EMU's Board of Trustees suspended the enforcement of its same-sex relationships policy and authorized Swartzendruber to lead a six month study of whether or not to allow tenure-track faculty to pursue same-sex relationships without censure.|$|E
25|$|Most monthly {{meetings}} of Baltimore Yearly Meeting (BYM, {{a member of}} both FGC and FUM) have taken a similar position. Similarly, although perhaps to a lesser extent, some meetings associated with groups on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> have dissented. Swansea Monthly Meeting, under care of New England Yearly Meeting, {{is one of two}} meetings in that group to publicly oppose same-sex marriage.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} divide over SB 100 was not partisan {{so much as}} it was regional, {{as members}} of both the Republican and Democratic parties fell on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> Within the populous Willamette Valley, support for the measure was high, with legislators voting by a margin of 5-to-1 in favor of the bill. Outside of the 9 valley counties, conservative legislators opposed passage of SB 100 by a ratio of more than 2-to-1. The populous valley's representation proved decisive, however, and on May 29, 1973, Governor McCall signed the bill into law.|$|E

25|$|Floyd and Richetti were {{alleged to}} have been Miller's accomplices. Factors {{weighing}} against them included their apparent presence in Kansas City at the time, eyewitness identifications (which have been contested), Richetti's fingerprint {{said to have been}} recovered from a beer bottle at Miller's hideout, an underworld account naming Floyd and Richetti as the gunmen, and Hoover's firm advocacy of their guilt. Fellow bank robber Alvin Karpis, an acquaintance of Floyd's, claimed that Floyd confessed involvement to him. On the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> the bandit {{alleged to have}} been Floyd {{was supposed to have been}} wounded by a gunshot to the shoulder in the attack, and Floyd's body showed no sign of this injury when examined later. The underworld account identifying Floyd and Richetti as the killers was offset by equally unreliable underworld accounts proclaiming their innocence or identifying others. The Floyd family has maintained that while Floyd admitted to many other crimes, he vehemently denied involvement in this one, as did Richetti. It has also been contended that this crime would have been inconsistent with Floyd's other criminal acts, as he was not otherwise known as a hired gun or (especially) a hired killer.|$|E
500|$|Multiple post-event {{comments}} by captains and players continued {{to report the}} annoyance of the anti-cheating measures, noting that a better balance between security and enjoyment could be found by FIDE. Baadur Jobava was prominent on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> opining that the anti-cheating measures would help solve the non-stop screaming about this great [...] "headache" [...] for the 21st century chess player.|$|E
500|$|The PTC {{is an avid}} {{supporter}} of [...] "a la carte" [...] cable television services to allow families to choose only the cable television channels that are appropriate for their children, and also impose the same decency standards already in place on broadcast television on cable channels. Frequently, the Council has criticized programs on BET, Comedy Central, E!, FX, MTV, Spike, TNT, and VH1 because they claim some of the content aired on those channels is inappropriate for younger viewers. On the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> the PTC has awarded its [...] "Seal of Approval" [...] to cable networks Disney Channel and Hallmark Channel for their original programs several years ago.|$|E
2500|$|As Davis {{left office}} in 2003, the San Francisco Chronicle {{published}} an editorial discussing his legacy. The newspaper {{claimed that he}} lacked vision, allowed the legislature and its policies to define his tenure and had a [...] "robotic governing style" [...] that focused on fundraising instead <b>of</b> personal relationships. <b>The</b> Chronicle commented that Davis was often on <b>the</b> right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> but that being on <b>the</b> right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> alienated <b>the</b> electorate. Davis lacked charisma {{and seemed to be}} more passionate about winning campaigns than governing. Davis never showed emotion to the voters. He spent much of his campaign time talking about his accomplishments instead of providing voters with a vision.|$|R
25|$|After the Catholic League {{protested the}} comic and then MSU {{president}} M. Peter McPherson declared {{he wanted it}} banned, the comic strip was removed for being too controversial.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{primary purpose}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{study was to}} {{identify}} and describe the arguments used in the sex education controversy in the Dallas Independent School District. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> was examined as a debate and as a social movement promoted and resisted by community rhetoricians. Arguments were elicited from interviews with rhetoricians on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue...</b>|$|R
500|$|Burnet {{chose to}} take an {{extremely}} hard line {{on the subject of}} the salary: he refused to conduct any other business, or to dissolve the legislature, until the salary was decided. The legislature in turn refused to enact a salary bill, although it offered generous one-time grants that Burnet refused on principle. [...] He further raised tensions by implicitly suggesting that the assembly's failure to act on the salary might jeopardize the colonial charter. [...] In order to make life as difficult as possible for the legislators, Burnet relocated the assembly from Boston first to Salem and then Cambridge, increasing the costs of the legislators and forcing many of them from the comforts of their Boston-area properties. [...] In November 1728 the assembly voted to send agents to London to argue their <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> with the Board of Trade. [...] Its attempts to appropriate funds for the agents were denied by the governor's council, and the agents ended up being paid from funds raised by subscription.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reviews of}} Five Days at Memorial were mostly positive. Jason Berry of The New York Times commended the [...] "shimmering intelligence" [...] of Fink's {{discussion}} of the events and their ethical issues, and summarized the book as [...] "social reporting of the first rank". Another New York Times critic, bioethicist Sherwin B. Nuland, felt the book displayed [...] "masterly reporting and the glow of fine writing" [...] and offered particular praise for the tone and language of Fink's writing. The Independent Hirsh Sawhney admired the detail and variety of perspectives offered {{in the book and}} described the book as [...] "soar to artistic and intellectual heights undreamed of in other realms of media". Peter Beaumont, writing for The Guardian, found parts of the book awkward in structure, but felt that overall it was [...] "tight, provocative and gripping" [...] with a [...] "fair and deeply sympathetic" [...] approach to the involved parties. A review by John B. Saul in The Seattle Times commended Fink's ability to produce a [...] "compelling and revealing account" [...] of events despite limited access to evidence such as investigative reports and Pou's testimony, while the Star Tribune Curt Schleier described Five Days at Memorial as [...] "an important book that will make your blood boil no matter which <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> you support".|$|E
2500|$|As usual, the Democratic {{leadership}} {{looked at}} the rational <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> County chairman, James J. Connor, challenged the GOP {{to come up with}} a plan to alleviate the population imbalance between congressional districts. [...] "The present Congressman from Delaware County represents 134,000 people more than he should in Washington", Connor stated. [...] "How does he (Eyre) propose to give the voters of Delaware County equal representation without a jointure with one or more of the adjoining areas?" ...|$|E
25|$|The {{language}} used by Jackson, {{combined with the}} reports coming out of South Carolina, raised <b>the</b> spectre <b>of</b> military confrontation for many on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> A group <b>of</b> Democrats, led by Van Buren and Thomas Hart Benton among others, saw the only solution to the crisis in a substantial reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tariff.|$|R
2500|$|Eastern Orthodox believers, on all <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> tend {{to believe}} this {{particular}} perspective on contraception is not adequately examined, and that any examination has too often become tied up in identity politics, the more affirming group accusing the categorically opposed group of Thomistic Latin influence. Still, the [...] "new consensus" [...] has not gone unchallenged.|$|R
50|$|Groups on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> {{have offered}} {{numerous}} arguments {{for and against}} the concept. Proponents promise a freer, more open market for insurance that would benefit consumers, increase product innovation, and help the economy. Opponents, on the other hand, believe that a new federal regulator will impose burdensome bureaucratic rules, squelch competition, and needlessly increase federal power.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the other}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> {{are those who}} have claimed that the {{increase}} is not significant, that it doesn't matter because America's economic growth and/or equality of opportunity are what's important, that it is a global phenomenon which would be foolish to try to change through US domestic policy, that it [...] "has many economic benefits and is the result of ... a well-functioning economy", and has or may become an excuse for [...] "class-warfare rhetoric", and may lead to policies that [...] "reduce the well-being of wealthier individuals".|$|E
2500|$|Various {{groups have}} great ideological, political, financial, and {{emotional}} investments in issues surrounding minimum wage laws. For example, agencies that administer the laws {{have a vested}} interest in showing that [...] "their" [...] laws do not create unemployment, as do labor unions whose members' finances are protected by minimum wage laws. On the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> low-wage employers such as restaurants finance the Employment Policies Institute, which has released numerous studies opposing the minimum wage. The presence of these powerful groups and factors means that the debate on the issue is not always based on dispassionate analysis. Additionally, it is extraordinarily difficult to separate the effects of minimum wage from all the other variables that affect employment.|$|E
2500|$|E. annectens was a saurolophine or [...] "flat-headed" [...] hadrosaurid; {{this group}} was {{historically}} known as Hadrosaurinae. Species now considered to be synonyms of Edmontosaurus annectens were long recognized as closely related to both the genus and the species. However, the skull of the sub-adult type specimen of E. annectens differs noticeably from fully mature remains, so many researchers had classified the two growth stages as different species or even genera. On the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> other authors, from John Bell Hatcher in 1902, to Jack Horner, David B. Weishampel, and Catherine Forster in 2004, and most recently Nicolás Campione and David Evans, have proposed that the large, flat-headed specimens most recently classified as Anatotitan copei belong to E. annectens.|$|E
5|$|During the {{petition}} drive, groups supporting Morse accused the firm collecting <b>the</b> signatures <b>of</b> hiring convicted felons and gathering personal information. Recall backers said that Morse's group was misleading the public. In addition, the recall drives brought in support from national groups on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> <b>The</b> National Rifle Association (NRA) supported the recall effort with mailers and donations. National groups opposing the recall included America Votes, {{believed to be}} financially supported by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, as well as California billionaire Eli Broad.|$|R
25|$|Moderns {{may be able}} to {{see both}} <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> however, as an {{historian}} might. Indeed, there exists a great difference in context between, say, an American, and a German historian <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1850s, where during 1848 citizens had made a rather spontaneous, incoherent effort to move German politics toward a free and unified country: it was crushed by the nobility.|$|R
50|$|Delegate Peña-Melnyk has {{sponsored}} and co-sponsored many bills {{over the past}} ten legislative sessions in support of LGBT issues. She sponsored legislation to ensure equality for transgender individuals, supported the same-sex marriage legislation that is now in effect and delivered a stirring defense of that bill on the House floor that drew <b>the</b> praise <b>of</b> legislators on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Although dril's {{content is}} {{typically}} somewhat absurd or nonsensical—once called [...] "obscene nonsense verse [...] the syntax mutilated, the humour irredeemable" [...] by Yohann Koshy in Vice—some have noted an underlying element of satire or social commentary in dril's tweets. Surveying Weird Twitter for Complex, Gallagher commented that dril's [...] "vicious satire of conservatives, gamers, conspiracy theorists, and other less savory {{aspects of the}} Internet is always on point, always hilarious, always in character." [...] Fellow Weird Twitter user @rare_basement said dril's [...] "trolling [...] Penn State fans during the molestation scandal was so brilliant, always on the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> but super funny and subtle about it." [...] Although dril does not avow an explicit political identity, the account's politics are generally identified as leftist, an alignment common among Weird Twitter users. However, the abstraction and vagueness of dril's tweets have allowed them to be spread and repurposed by people across the political spectrum—for example, even the far-right Breitbart News has quoted dril on its Twitter feed.|$|E
6000|$|There was no disputing the {{fairness}} of the proposition.

2500|$|Koop did {{not present}} the draft report to Reagan and claimed he never {{approved}} it. In March 1989, the [...] "Koop Report" [...] became public {{after it was}} subpoenaed and became part of a Congressional subcommittee hearing.

50|$|Critics {{alleged that}} some media groups in {{broadcast}} and print were partisan in reporting the crisis. Alternative media, mostly in radio, made similar accusations, though {{some may be}} partisan themselves. These accusations though between them are not new, and are common during propaganda wars, as politically motivated groups use connections in media to promote their side. During <b>the</b> latter part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crisis, this has changed as the media became generally more critical in delivery, which was beneficial for properly informing viewers about <b>the</b> many <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues.</b> <b>The</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> press was thus kept in commentary.|$|R

50|$|Another {{factor in}} {{inferring}} a disposition from an action {{is whether the}} behaviour of the actor is constrained by situational forces or whether it occurs from the actor's choice. If a student were assigned to argue a position in a classroom debate (e.g. for or against Neoliberalism), it would be unwise of their audience to infer that their statements in the debate reflect their true beliefs - {{because they did not}} choose to argue that particular <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> If, however, they had chosen to argue one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> then it would be appropriate for the audience to conclude that their statements reflect their true beliefs.|$|E
