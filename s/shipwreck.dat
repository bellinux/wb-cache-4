50|$|The Historic <b>Shipwrecks</b> Act 1976 is an Australian Act of Parliament {{designed}} to legally protect historic <b>shipwrecks</b> and any relics or artifacts from those wrecks.

5|$|On the 60th {{anniversary of}} the sinking, 60 Minutes ran a story demonstrating that the wreck was not Centaur. It was {{revealed}} that nobody at the Queensland Maritime Museum had yet seen Dennis' footage, {{and when it was}} shown to Museum president Rod McLeod and maritime historian John Foley, they stated that the <b>shipwreck</b> could not be Centaur due to physical inconsistencies, such as an incorrect rudder. Following this story, and others published around the same time in newspapers, the Navy sent three ships to inspect the site over a two-month period; HMA Ships , , and , before concluding that the <b>shipwreck</b> was incorrectly identified as Centaur. An amendment was made to the gazettal, and the Hydrographic Office began to remove the mark from charts.|$|E

Due to geological differences within Flevoland, soil profiles related to <b>shipwrecks</b> can only be compared on their specific geological region. In this case study, 29 profile drawings from <b>shipwrecks</b> in the Northeast Polder region and their soil profiles were analyzed. As a result, five ships were re-assigned a new and more accurate date of wreckage...|$|R
