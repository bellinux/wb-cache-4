5|$|Netball Australia {{also runs}} a {{modified}} game called Netta aimed at 8- to 11-year-olds. The goal height and ball size are the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>for</b> adults, but players rotate positions during the game, permitting each player to play each position. Netta {{was created to}} develop passing and catching skills. Its rules permit six seconds between catching and passing the ball, instead of the three seconds permitted in the adult game. Most players under 11 play this version at netball clubs.|$|E

Devices with low storage capacity must provide a USB flash drive or SD card with sufficient storage for temporary files during upgrades.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} view of equites cohortales (the cavalry arm of cohortes equitatae), as expounded by G.L. Cheesman, {{was that}} they were just a mounted infantry with poor-quality horses. They would use their mounts simply to reach the battlefield and then would dismount to fight. This view is today discredited. Although it is clear that equites cohortales did not match equites alares (ala cavalrymen) in quality (hence their lower pay), the evidence is that they fought as cavalry {{in the same way as}} the alares and often alongside them. Their armour and weapons were the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>for</b> the alares.|$|E

5|$|Tom Kitt was {{the music}} {{supervisor}} and orchestrator {{for both the}} Berkeley and Broadway productions. The lead producers for the show were Ira Pittelman and Tom Hulce. Vivek Tiwary was another producer. The creative team for the show was largely the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>for</b> the musical adaptation of Spring Awakening: director Michael Mayer, scenic designer Christine Jones and lighting designer Kevin Adams. Steven Hoggett was the choreographer, Andrea Lauer was the costume designer and Brian Ronan was the sound designer.|$|E
5|$|Tyre {{supplier}} Pirelli brought three compounds to Bahrain, {{from which}} drivers {{were allowed to}} choose. The three options for the event were the super-soft, soft and medium compounds, the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>for</b> the previous round in Australia. Frontrunners Mercedes and Ferrari opted for different strategies in tyre allocation, as Mercedes took only one set of the harder medium tyres for both their drivers, while Ferrari chose three sets {{at the expense of}} soft compound tyres.|$|E

5|$|Loxton {{had scored}} 203 runs in three innings {{at an average}} of 101.50, but was not selected, nor was middle-order batsman Harvey, who had scored a century in the {{previous}} Test against India. Harvey struggled to adapt to English conditions at the start of his first tour and made only 83 runs at 16.60 in five innings on tour. Brown, who had scored 527 runs at 75.28 for the season so far, including three centuries in his last three innings, was played out of position in the middle-order, even though he had batted as an opener in every tour match other than against Worcestershire. Due to the rotation policy in the tour matches, only two of the three openers Brown, Morris and Barnes played in any one game while the other rested, except when Bradman tried to fit all three in a full-strength team by having Brown in the middle-order. The team was exactly the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>for</b> the opening fixture against Worcestershire.|$|E
5|$|While {{studying}} naturally fluorescing minerals in 1896, the French physicist Henri Becquerel {{discovered that}} they emitted radiation without any exposure to an external energy source. These radioactive materials {{became the subject of}} much interest by scientists, including the New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford who discovered they emitted particles. He designated these particles alpha and beta, {{on the basis of their}} ability to penetrate matter. In 1900, Becquerel showed that the beta rays emitted by radium could be deflected by an electric field, and that their mass-to-charge ratio was the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>for</b> cathode rays. This evidence strengthened the view that electrons existed as components of atoms.|$|E
