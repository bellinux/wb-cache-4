5|$|Endtroducing..... is {{the debut}} studio album by American music {{producer}} DJ Shadow, released on September 16, 1996 by the British independent record label Mo' Wax Recordings. The album {{is known for}} being composed almost entirely of sampled content, most of which originated from various vinyl records obtained by DJ Shadow during trips to record shops.

50|$|The main {{difference}} between cluster <b>sampling</b> and stratified <b>sampling</b> {{is that in}} cluster <b>sampling</b> the cluster is treated as the <b>sampling</b> unit so <b>sampling</b> is done on a population of clusters (at least in the first stage). In stratified <b>sampling,</b> the <b>sampling</b> is done on elements within each strata. In stratified <b>sampling,</b> a random <b>sample</b> is drawn {{from each of the}} strata, whereas in cluster <b>sampling</b> only the selected clusters are <b>sampled.</b> A common motivation of cluster <b>sampling</b> is to reduce costs by increasing <b>sampling</b> efficiency. This contrasts with stratified <b>sampling</b> where the motivation is to increase precision.|$|R

5|$|Despite McDonald's close involvement, the xx {{had been}} {{encouraged}} to self-produce their album by Russell; he believed it would remain faithful to both the band's distinctive live sound and the DIY ethic practiced at XL since its beginnings as a rave label. Smith was chosen {{by the rest of}} the group to produce xx. He used Logic 8 recording software on his Mac Pro and often worked late nights in a nearby conference room while they recorded in the studio with drafts of his beats. Smith produced rhythm tracks with an Akai MPC <b>sampler,</b> which he occasionally processed through a Roland RE-201 and other effects units. He also created click tracks for the rest of the band to keep timing when they recorded their individual parts. After those parts had been recorded, he refined and incorporated his beats into the songs for three to four weeks. Croft trusted that Smith, who did not want to conceal any imperfections by overproducing xx, would make it practical for them to perform live rather than layer the songs with several guitar or vocal elements.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Stella North was at {{the centre}} of a legal case in which three men were found guilty of {{conspiracy}} to defraud after {{trying to sell the}} CEGB poor quality coal when contracted to deliver high quality coal. The three men involved were D.C.P. Brooksbank, a salesman for a coal firm; J.W. Patterson, a <b>sampler</b> at the power station, and M. Ridley, a contractor. Their scheme was for Patterson to substitute samples of reasonably good coal for the samples of poor coal taken from the lorries. However they were found out only two days after starting the scheme, when a foreman at the station saw Patterson dropping a bag of cement into the sampling bin, and reported the incident. Ridley was found to have planned the fraud, and was jailed for a year, while Brooksbank was fined £150 and Patterson £75.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{develops}} the fundamental capacity limits of a <b>sampled</b> analog channel under a sub-Nyquist <b>sampling</b> rate constraint. In particular, we derive {{the capacity of}} <b>sampled</b> analog channels over a general class of time-preserving <b>sampling</b> methods including irregular nonuniform <b>sampling.</b> Our {{results indicate that the}} optimal <b>sampling</b> structures extract out the set of frequencies that exhibits the highest SNR among all spectral sets of support size equal to the <b>sampling</b> rate. The capacity under sub-Nyquist <b>sampling</b> can be attained through filter-bank <b>sampling,</b> or through a single branch of modulation and filtering followed by uniform <b>sampling.</b> The capacity under sub-Nyquist <b>sampling</b> is a monotone function of the <b>sampling</b> rate. These results indicate that the optimal <b>sampling</b> schemes suppress aliasing, and that employing irregular nonuniform <b>sampling</b> does not provide capacity gain over uniform <b>sampling</b> sets with appropriate preprocessing for a large class of channels.
