5|$|The {{arcuate nucleus}} {{contains}} two distinct groups of neurons. The first group coexpresses neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and inhibitory inputs to the VMH. The second group coexpresses pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and has stimulatory inputs to the VMH and inhibitory inputs to the LH. Consequently, NPY/AgRP neurons stimulate feeding and inhibit <b>satiety,</b> while POMC/CART neurons stimulate <b>satiety</b> and inhibit feeding. Both groups of arcuate nucleus neurons are regulated {{in part by}} leptin. Leptin inhibits the NPY/AgRP group while stimulating the POMC/CART group. Thus a deficiency in leptin signaling, either via leptin deficiency or leptin resistance, leads to overfeeding and may account for some genetic and acquired forms of obesity.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} pathophysiological mechanisms {{involved in the}} development and maintenance of obesity. This field of research had been almost unapproached until the leptin gene was discovered in 1994 by J. M. Friedman's laboratory. While leptin and ghrelin are produced peripherally, they control appetite through their actions on the central nervous system. In particular, they and other appetite-related hormones act on the hypothalamus, a region of the brain central to the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. There are several circuits within the hypothalamus that contribute to its role in integrating appetite, the melanocortin pathway being the most well understood. The circuit begins with an area of the hypothalamus, the arcuate nucleus, that has outputs to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), the brain's feeding and <b>satiety</b> centers, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The last {{stage of}} <b>satiety</b> {{occurs in the}} liver. The liver is also the first organ to detect that {{nutrients}} are being received from the intestines. When the liver receives nutrients, it then sends {{a signal to the}} brain that produces satiety; but essentially, it is continuing the <b>satiety</b> that was already started by signals that arose from the stomach and upper intestine.|$|E
25|$|H3 receptors {{are thought}} to {{play a part in}} the control of <b>satiety.</b>|$|E
25|$|The stomach {{contains}} receptors {{that can}} detect {{the presence of}} nutrients, but there are detectors in the intestines as well, and the <b>satiety</b> factors of the stomach and intestines can interact. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide hormone secreted by the duodenum that controls the rate of stomach emptying. CCK is secreted {{in response to the}} presence of fats, which are detected in by receptors in the duodenum. Another <b>satiety</b> signal produced by cells is peptide YY3-36 (PYY), which is released after a meal in amounts proportional to the calories ingested.|$|E
25|$|Neuroendocrine dysregulation: altered {{signalling}} of peptides {{that facilitate}} {{communication between the}} gut, brain and adipose tissue, such as ghrelin, leptin, neuropeptide Y and orexin, {{may contribute to the}} pathogenesis of anorexia nervosa by disrupting regulation of hunger and <b>satiety.</b>|$|E
25|$|With {{regards to}} interoception, people with bulimia report reduced {{sensitivity}} to {{many kinds of}} internal and external sensations. For example, some show increased thresholds to heat pain compared and report {{the same level of}} <b>satiety</b> after consuming more calories than do healthy subjects.|$|E
25|$|The {{seeds of}} the Griffonia simplicifolia, a {{climbing}} shrub native to West Africa and Central Africa, are used as an herbal supplement for their 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) content. In one 2010 trial, Griffonia simplicifolia extract appeared to increase <b>satiety</b> in overweight women.|$|E
25|$|This is the least-understood of the {{glucokinase}} sensor systems. It {{seems likely}} that responses to incoming glucose during digestion {{play a role in}} the incretin amplification of insulin secretion during a meal, or in the generation of <b>satiety</b> signals from gut to brain.|$|E
25|$|Gutpeptide hypothesis: {{gastrointestinal}} hormones like Grp, glucagons, CCK {{and others}} claimed to inhibit food intake. The food entering the gastrointestinal tract triggers {{the release of}} these hormones, which act on the brain to produce <b>satiety.</b> The brain contains both CCK-A and CCK-B receptors.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two primary}} sources of signals that stop eating: {{short-term}} signals come from immediate effects of eating a meal, beginning before food digestion, and long-term signals, {{that arise in}} adipose tissue, control the intake of calories by monitoring the sensitivity of brain mechanisms to hunger and <b>satiety</b> signals received.|$|E
25|$|Research has {{confirmed}} that physiological mechanisms {{play an important}} role in homeostasis; however, human food intake must also be evaluated within the context of non-physiological determinants present in human life. Within laboratory environments, hunger and <b>satiety</b> are factors that can be controlled and tested. Outside of experiments though, social constraints may influence the size and number of daily meals.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} sets of receptors {{located in the}} head: eyes, nose, tongue, and throat. The most {{important}} role of head factors in <b>satiety</b> is that taste and odor can serve as stimuli that permit learning about caloric contents of different foods. Tasting and swallowing of food contributes to the feeling of fullness caused {{by the presence of}} food in the stomach.|$|E
25|$|Signals {{arising from}} the {{long-term}} nutrient reservoir of the body may alter {{the sensitivity of the}} brain to hunger signals or short-term <b>satiety</b> signals. A peptide, leptin, has profound effects on metabolism and eating. It is secreted by adipose tissue and it increases metabolic rate while decreasing food intake. Its discovery has stimulated interest in finding ways of treating obesity.|$|E
25|$|In {{juvenile}} {{red deer}} (Cervus elaphus), the preorbital gland appears {{to play a}} role in the response to stress. The preorbital gland is closed in a relaxed calf, whereas it is opened in a stressed calf. One example of this is the signalling of hunger and <b>satiety.</b> Fawns open their preorbital glands as a signal that they are hungry, and close the gland after feeding, when they are no longer hungry.|$|E
25|$|While all neurons use glucose for fuel, certain glucose-sensing neurons {{alter their}} firing rates in {{response}} to rising or falling levels of glucose. These glucose-sensing neurons are concentrated primarily in the ventromedial nucleus and arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, which regulate many aspects of glucose homeostasis (especially the response to hypoglycemia), fuel utilization, <b>satiety</b> and appetite, and weight maintenance. These neurons are most sensitive to glucose changes in the 0.5â€“3.5mmol/L glucose range.|$|E
25|$|Glucostatic hypothesis: The {{activity}} of the <b>satiety</b> center in the ventromedial nuclei is probably governed by the glucose utilization in the neurons. It has been postulated that when their glucose utilization is low and consequently when the arteriovenous blood glucose difference across them is low, the activity across the neurons decrease. Under these conditions, the {{activity of}} the feeding center is unchecked and the individual feels hungry. Food intake is rapidly increased by intraventricular administration of 2-deoxyglucose therefore decreasing glucose utilization in cells.|$|E
25|$|Leptin, however, plays a {{different}} role in diet-induced obesity in rodents and humans. Because adipocytes produce leptin, leptin levels are elevated in the obese. However, hunger remains, and- when leptin levels drop due to weight loss- hunger increases. The drop of leptin is better {{viewed as a}} starvation signal than the rise of leptin as a <b>satiety</b> signal. However, elevated leptin in obesity is known as leptin resistance. The changes {{that occur in the}} hypothalamus to result in leptin resistance in obesity are currently the focus of obesity research.|$|E
25|$|Fiber {{is defined}} by its {{physiological}} impact, with many heterogenous types of fibers. Some fibers may primarily impact one of these benefits (i.e., cellulose increases fecal bulking and prevents constipation), but many fibers impact {{more than one of}} these benefits (i.e., resistant starch increases bulking, increases colonic fermentation, positively modulates colonic microflora and increases <b>satiety</b> and insulin sensitivity). The beneficial effects of high fiber diets are the summation {{of the effects of the}} different types of fiber present in the diet and also other components of such diets.|$|E
25|$|After surgery, {{patients}} feel fullness after ingesting {{only a small}} {{volume of}} food, followed soon thereafter {{by a sense of}} <b>satiety</b> and loss of appetite. Total food intake is markedly reduced. Due to the reduced size of the newly created stomach pouch, and reduced food intake, adequate nutrition demands that the patient follow the surgeon's instructions for food consumption, including the number of meals to be taken daily, adequate protein intake, and the use of vitamin and mineral supplements. Calcium supplements, iron supplements, protein supplements, multi-vitamins (sometimes pre-natal vitamins are best), and vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) supplements are all very important to the post-operative bypass patient.|$|E
25|$|Obesity can unfavorably alter {{hormonal}} and metabolic status via {{resistance to}} the hormone leptin, and a vicious cycle may occur in which insulin/leptin resistance and obesity aggravate one another. The vicious cycle is putatively fueled by continuously high insulin/leptin stimulation and fat storage, {{as a result of}} high intake of strongly insulin/leptin stimulating foods and energy. Both insulin and leptin normally function as <b>satiety</b> signals to the hypothalamus in the brain; however, insulin/leptin resistance may reduce this signal and therefore allow continued overfeeding despite large body fat stores. In addition, reduced leptin signaling to the brain may reduce leptin's normal effect to maintain an appropriately high metabolic rate.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{gastrointestinal}} complications of anorexia nervosa are delayed stomach emptying and constipation, but also include elevated liver function tests, diarrhea, acute pancreatitis, heartburn, difficulty swallowing, and, rarely, superior mesenteric artery syndrome. Delayed stomach emptying, or gastroparesis, often develops following food restriction and weight loss; {{the most common}} symptom is bloating with gas and abdominal distension, and often occurs after eating. Other symptoms of gastroparesis include early <b>satiety,</b> fullness, nausea, and vomiting. The symptoms may inhibit efforts at eating and recovery, but can be managed by limiting high-fiber foods, using liquid nutritional supplements, or using metoclopramide to increase emptying of food from the stomach. Gastroparesis generally resolves when weight is regained.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} treatment {{strategy for}} is casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP), {{which is a}} milk peptide naturally free of Phe in its pure form CGMP can substitute {{the main part of}} the free amino acids in the PKU diet and provides several beneficial nutritional effects compared to free amino acids. The fact that CGMP is a peptide ensures that the absorption rate of its amino acids is prolonged compared to free amino acids and thereby results in improved protein retention and increased <b>satiety</b> compared to free amino acids. Another important benefit of CGMP is that the taste is significantly improved when CGMP substitutes part of the free amino acids and this may help ensure improved compliance to the PKU diet.|$|E
25|$|Meals {{during the}} Japanese {{occupation}} were quite varied. Koreans usually ate two {{meals a day}} during the cold seasons, and three during the warm seasons. For the lower classes, <b>satiety,</b> rather than quality, was most important. Those in even lower economic levels were likely to enjoy only a single bowl of white rice each year, while {{the remainder of the}} year was filled with cheaper grains, such as millet and barley. For the Korean middle and upper classes during the occupation, things were quite different. Western foods began emerging in the Korean diet, such as white bread and commercially produced staples such as precooked noodles. The Japanese occupational period ended after the defeat of Japan during World War II.|$|E
25|$|Many ADPKD {{patients}} suffer symptomatic sequelae {{in consequence}} of the disease, such as cyst hemorrhage, flank pain, recurrent infections, nephrolithiasis, and symptoms of mass effect (i.e., early <b>satiety,</b> nausea and vomiting, and abdominal discomfort), from their enlarged kidneys. In such cases, nephrectomy can be required due to intractable symptoms or when, {{in the course of}} preparing for renal transplantation, the native kidneys are found to impinge upon the true pelvis and preclude the placement of a donor allograft. Additionally, native nephrectomy may be undertaken in the presence of suspected malignancy, as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is 2 to 3 times more likely in the ADPKD population in end stage renal disease (ESRD) than in the ESRD patients without ADPKD. Although the indications for nephrectomy in ADPKD may be related to kidney size, the decision to proceed with native nephrectomy is often undertaken on an individual basis, without specific reference to kidney size measurements.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, non-selective {{serotonin}} receptor antagonists demonstrated {{a relationship between}} serotonin receptors and food intake. Later, animal studies showed that serotonin receptor agonists might act as a mediator of <b>satiety.</b> Serotonin has been implicated as {{a critical factor in}} the short-term regulation of food intake and in promoting loss of weight associated with hyperphagia. Studies using pharmacological and genetic tools demonstrated that the 5-HT2C receptor subtype was one of the principal mediators through which serotonin exerts its anorectic effects in rodents. Subsequently, these receptors became a promising pharmacotherapeutic target for further investigation for the treatment of obesity. The development of 5-HT2C receptor knockout mice in the mid-1990s was a hallmark achievement in the identification and development of serotonergic drugs for weight loss. These knockout mice were hyperphagic, which led to obesity, partial Leptin resistance, increased adipose deposition, insulin resistance, and impaired glucose tolerance. As a result of these symptoms, the researchers identified a functional role for the receptors in serotonergic regulation of food intake and body weight. Later, 5-HT2C receptors were proposed as a therapeutic target for the treatment of multiple central nervous system (CNS) disorders including: psychiatric disorders, obesity, sexual dysfunction and urinary incontinence.|$|E
500|$|Beitchman notes that, {{throughout}} his life, Tzara used Symbolist elements against the doctrines of Symbolism. Thus, he argues, the poet did not cultivate {{a memory of}} historical events, [...] "since it deludes man into thinking {{that there was something}} when there was nothing." [...] Cernat notes: [...] "That which essentially unifies, during , the poetic output of Adrian Maniu, Ion Vinea and Tristan Tzara is an acute awareness of literary conventions, a <b>satiety</b> [...] in respect to calophile literature, which they perceived as exhausted." [...] In Beitchman's view, the revolt against cultivated beauty was a constant in Tzara's years of maturity, and his visions of social change continued to be inspired by Arthur Rimbaud and the Comte de LautrÃ©amont. According to Beitchman, Tzara uses the Symbolist message, [...] "the birthright [...] has been sold for a mess of porridge", taking it [...] "into the streets, cabarets and trains where he denounces the deal and asks for his birthright back." ...|$|E
2500|$|The choicest {{women were}} imprisoned behind heavy {{curtains}} and locked doors, the strings and keys {{of which were}} entrusted {{into the hands of}} that pitiable creature â€“ the eunuch. As the size of the harem grew, men indulged to <b>satiety.</b> <b>Satiety</b> within the individual harem meant boredom for the one man and neglect for the many women. Under these conditions ... satisfaction by perverse and unnatural means crept into society, particularly in its upper classes.|$|E
2500|$|Amylin, or islet amyloid {{polypeptide}} (IAPP), is a 37-residue peptide hormone. [...] It is cosecreted with insulin {{from the}} pancreatic Î²-cells in {{the ratio of}} approximately 100:1. [...] Amylin {{plays a role in}} glycemic regulation by slowing gastric emptying and promoting <b>satiety,</b> thereby preventing post-prandial spikes in blood glucose levels.|$|E
2500|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} include early <b>satiety,</b> nausea, vomiting, extreme [...] "stabbing" [...] postprandial abdominal pain (due {{to both the}} duodenal compression and the compensatory reversed peristalsis), abdominal distention/distortion, burping (eructation), external hypersensitivity or tenderness of the abdominal area, reflux, and heartburn. In infants, feeding difficulties and poor weight gain are also frequent symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{indicate}} that 5-HT2C receptor activation will regulate appetite and food consumption, most likely by promoting <b>satiety</b> through appetite suppression by activation of 5-HT2C. Consequently, selective agents with high affinity for this receptor over 5-HT2B and 5-HT22A {{are being developed}} {{for the treatment of}} obesity. receptor agonist |journal=European Journal of Pharmacology |pmid=14709324 |doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2003.10.004 |year=2004 |volume=483 |pages=37â€“43 |issue=1}} ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{development}} {{is related to}} its unique {{physical and chemical properties}} that aid in early signals of satiation and enhanced or prolonged signals of <b>satiety.</b> Early signals of satiation may be induced through cephalic- and gastric-phase responses related to the bulking effects of dietary fiber on energy density and palatability, whereas the viscosity-producing effects of certain fibers may enhance <b>satiety</b> through intestinal-phase events related to modified gastrointestinal function and subsequent delay in fat absorption. In general, fiber-rich diets, whether achieved through fiber supplementation or incorporation of high fiber foods into meals, have a reduced energy density compared with high fat diets. This is related to fiberâ€™s ability to add bulk and weight to the diet. There are also indications that women may be more sensitive to dietary manipulation with fiber than men. The relationship of body weight status and fiber effect on energy intake suggests that obese individuals {{may be more likely to}} reduce food intake with dietary fiber inclusion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{receptor}} for ghrelin, the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R), {{is found}} on the same cells in the brain as the receptor for leptin, the <b>satiety</b> hormone that has opposite effects from ghrelin.

2500|$|Tolkien's {{perception}} of further {{history of the}} kingdom is illustrated by The New Shadow, an experimental story that he abandoned, set {{during the reign of}} Eldarion.
