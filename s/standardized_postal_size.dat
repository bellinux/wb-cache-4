40|$|AbstractA {{case-control study}} {{of risk factors}} for community-acquired {{pneumonia}} in adults admitted to hospital is reported. Cases were surviving patients (n= 178) admitted to 14 hospitals in England. Controls were individuals (n= 385) randomly selected from the electoral registers of the areas served by the hospitals. The two groups were compared with regard to risk factors for pneumonia using a <b>standardized</b> <b>postal</b> questionnaire. Independent risk factors associated with cases in log-linear regression analysis were age, heart disease (as indicated by congestive heart failure and/or digitalis treatment), lifetime smoking history, chronic airway disease (chronic bronchitis and/or asthma), occupational dust exposure, pneumonia as a child, single marital status and unemployment. Corticosteroid and bronchodilator therapy were also independent risk factors in the log-linear regression analysis, but may reflect the severity of underlying lung disease for which these drugs were prescribed. These data suggest that cigarette smoking is the major avoidable risk factor for acute pneumonia in adults...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The reverse camber shoe (RCS) is {{commonly}} used for forefoot off-loading during mobilization after forefoot surgery. However, patient sat-isfaction and compliance may be affected because of the altered gait pat-tern that is conferred. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the patient-related factors associated with the com-pliance in the use of this device. The authors retrospectively reviewed a sin-gle surgeon series of 64 patients who underwent forefoot surgery and who were subsequently rehabilitated with early mobilization using the RCS. Data on patient age, arthritic comorbidi-ties, adaptation to device, and symp-toms during use were collected via a <b>standardized</b> <b>postal</b> questionnaire. In all, 39 patients complied with the use of the RCS for 8 weeks (group A), whereas 11 patients managed it for less than 6 weeks (group C). Also, 14 patients used the shoe for more than 6 weeks but less than 8 weeks (group B). The authors found that compliance in the use of the RCS is lower in older patients following forefoot surgery. This may be related to poor adaptation in the presence of pre-existing arthritis...|$|R
5000|$|The use of {{provisional}} stamps became practical {{after an}} act of Congress on March 3, 1845 <b>standardized</b> <b>postal</b> fees throughout the nation at 5¢ for a normal-weight letter transported up to 300 miles and 10¢ for a letter transported between 300 and 3000 miles. [...] (Before standardization, the many different postal rates in different jurisdictions had made fees too unpredictable to prepay all letters with stamps {{as a matter of}} course, with the result that recipients of letters--rather than senders--generally paid the postage on them.) St. Louis was one of eleven U. S. cities that issued these so-called Postmasters' Provisionals, and--owing to its distance from Atlantic population centers--the only one to offer a provisional denomination larger than 10¢. Moreover, none of the ten other cities produced a provisional stamp design so ambitious in its visual content (its homespun artistic realization notwithstanding). Some provisionals were merely handstamps; others offered engraved letters and numerals and/or reproduced signatures; while two presented portraits of George Washington, one of them--the New York Postmaster's Provisional--engraved with considerable skill by a firm specializing in bank notes. The use of provisionals ceased in the U. S. after national postage stamps became available on July 1, 1847.|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2007 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd. Published by John Wiley & Sons, LtdBACKGROUND: Some {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that patients with predominantly upright reflux have a poor outcome after laparoscopic antireflux surgery. It has been proposed that this might be related to gastric emptying. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the relationship between preoperative upright reflux pattern, gastric emptying rate and outcome after laparoscopic fundoplication. METHODS: Patients presenting for antireflux surgery underwent 24 -h ambulatory pH testing and dual-isotope radionuclide gastric emptying studies. Reflux pattern was determined by the acid exposure in the distal oesophagus (percentage of time at pH < 4) during supine and upright posture. Outcome after fundoplication was assessed by a <b>standardized</b> <b>postal</b> questionnaire administered at 3 months, and 1, 2 and 5 years after surgery. RESULTS: Of 372 patients identified from a prospectively maintained database, 109 had upright reflux, 57 supine reflux and 206 bipositional reflux. Overall patient satisfaction was not influenced by reflux pattern at any time after surgery. Delayed gastric emptying was documented in 31. 0 per cent of patients, but there was no relationship with reflux pattern. CONCLUSION: Patients with upright reflux did not have a less favourable outcome after fundoplication. Categorizing patients according to reflux pattern is of no value in predicting outcome or selecting patients for surgery. J. Wayman, J. C. Myers and G. G. Jamieso...|$|R
40|$|In 2004, H. e. Dr Mohammad Benten was {{appointed}} president of Saudi Post (SP), a government-owned company facing critical challenges affecting its survival. The company’s customers perceived the Post {{as a traditional}} channel of communication for the exchange of letters. They believed that, due {{to the evolution of}} new technologies, the role of the Post in their daily life would become obsolete. The national mail market was also characterized by growing competition from private international logistics companies, especially in the parcel and eMS segments. Moreover, the company’s network infrastructure was unable {{to keep pace with the}} growing development of local and international businesses operating in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Indeed the company faced difficulties in efficiently providing its core service, the delivering of packages and mail. One reason behind these difficulties was the absence of a <b>standardized</b> <b>postal</b> addressing system in the country. Until recently, the citizens of the Kingdom used an inaccurate postal address to communicate by post, or had to rent a P. O. box at their nearest post office to pick up their mail. Homes did not have mailboxes at all, and the country lacked a single, unified addressing system. That limitation led various institutions, such as government agencies or private logistics companies, to create their own grids and use different addressing systems for the same location, complicating the operational process for mail as well as duplicating the infrastructure costs. / [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims: The {{aetiology}} {{of systemic}} scleroderma remains poorly understood. Twin studies suggest a low genetic input. Of the incriminated environmental agents, silica and {{vinyl chloride monomer}} exposure appear the most convincing. Spatiotemporal clustering has been demonstrated only three times previously. We now report a fourth cluster around Edenhope, western Victoria in terms of numerator and denominator estimates, cumulative incidence, distribution in time and space, and possible aetiological factors. Methods: Prevalence/cumulative incidence numerator and denominator values were obtained and validated. Each case was age-and gender-matched with two controls. A <b>standardized</b> <b>postal</b> questionnaire was used to obtain data on current, past history, family history, and occupational and non-occupational environmental exposure. Results: Six systemic scleroderma cases and one {{mixed connective tissue disease}} patient with a predominance of scleroderma features were identified. The 5 -year cumulative incidence was 6. 1 / 10 000, tenfold higher than the Sydney estimates for a similar, though non-identical time period. The gender ratio was 1 : 1. No cases were genetically related. A family history of scleroderma was validated in one instance and a family history of Raynaud 2 ̆ 7 s was noted in first degree relatives of two cases and one control. In all instances, Edenhope residence preceded disease onset. No one environmental agent was implicated in all cases. Conclusion: A spatiotemporal cluster of systemic scleroderma was confirmed and validated. It occurred with a tenfold increased cumulative incidence to that expected and also extended beyond the initially defined 50 km radius of Edenhope. The cases identified were not related. Although no one specific environmental agent was identified, the spatiotemporal clustering would be compatible with an agent occurring at relatively high frequency, but with low disease conversion rates, such as silica inhalation (assuming sufficiently small particle size) or reaction to an infective agent...|$|R

40|$|Background Due {{to their}} continual rise {{over the last}} decades, allergies and asthma {{developed}} into common diseases worldwide. Despite international studies such as ISAAC and ECRHS, there are still gaps in our knowledge concerning allergic diseases in certain populations. The aim of the Brandenburg Asthma and Allergy Study (BASAL) {{was to assess the}} prevalence of allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, atopic dermatitis, urticaria and chronic sinusitis in adults from rural, Eastern Germany. Possible determinants including smoking, close contact to farm animals in early childhood and working in the health sector or cleaning service were recorded. Methods For this population-based cross-sectional study, 5, 500 <b>standardized</b> <b>postal</b> questionnaires were sent to a random sample of a 15 to 75 year old population in two counties in the state of Brandenburg. These included questions on the occurrence and possible risk factors of asthma and allergies. The data were analyzed using the statistical program SPSS. Results 2, 296 questionnaires (response 42 %) were included in the analysis. The average age of the study population (56 % were women) was 48 (SD 16) years old. In their first year of life, 40 % of the participants had close contact to farm animals. At the time oft he survey, 7 % were health service workers and 4 % cleaning workers. Lifetime prevalence of asthma was 9 %, of allergic rhinitis 23 % and of chronic sinusitis 5 %. Lifetime prevalence of allergic skin diseases were 15 % for atopic dermatitis and 28 % for urticaria. All allergic diseases occurred more often among women. Participants who had contact to farm animals in early childhood showed a decreased prevalence for allergic rhinitis (OR 0. 69; 95 % CI 0. 56 – 0. 86) and a borderline significantly decreased prevalence for asthma (OR 0. 71; 95 % CI 0. 51 – 1. 00). Among cleaning workers there was an increased likelihood for developing urticaria (OR 1. 92; 95 % CI 1. 25 – 2. 95). Among health service workers there was a borderline significantly increased likelihood for urticaria (OR 1. 62; 95 % CI 1. 15 – 2. 27). There was also a higher prevalence for allergic rhinitis in health service workers (OR 1. 99; 95 % CI 1. 41 – 2. 80). Conclusions The BASAL Study showed a relatively high prevalence of asthma and allergies in a rural population of Brandenburg in Eastern Germany among all age groups from adolescents to the elderly. The results of the study supported the hypothesis of a protective effect of a farm environment in early childhood. Health service and cleaning workers had an increased risk for skin allergies compared to other study participants. Health service workers also had an increased risk for nasal allergies. To assess detailed data for environmental risk factors and their influence on asthma and allergies future long term studies are needed...|$|R
5000|$|The {{realization}} of his proposal through the Austro-Hungarian post office made Herrmann a well-known personality in Europe, but later his authorship of the postcard was contested. In the German Reichstag parliament a government speaker {{declared that the}} Prussian post director Heinrich Stephan (later raised to [...] "von Stephan") had voiced this idea already in 1865. At the 5th German postal conference in Karlsruhe in November 1865 Stephan had indeed distributed a private memorandum with a similar suggestion. [...] "The present letter form does not provide the sufficient simplicity and shortness for {{a considerable number of}} messages". Stephan, however, had not actually proposed the postcard, but a <b>postal</b> sheet the <b>size</b> of a money transfer form, stiffer than letter paper and slightly larger than the usual envelope, with an imprinted duty stamp and available at all post offices. The prepaid postage was to be one silver groschen, which was the regular German postage fee. As this would have meant no reduction in postage, it would have been no actual innovation but would only have simplified postal handling. In fact, Germany later introduced not Stephan's postal sheet due to its lack of privacy but a post card on precisely the Austrian model. It is, however, quite possible that Herrmann developed his model upon Stephan's suggestion.Heinrich von Stephan himself never claimed the authorship of the postcard idea.|$|R
