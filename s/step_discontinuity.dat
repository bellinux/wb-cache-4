40|$|This report {{documents}} work on {{the effects}} of surface roughness on the reliability of an ultrasonic inservice inspection. The primary objective of this research is to develop ASME Code recommendations in order to limit the adverse effects of a rough surface and thereby increase the reliability of ultrasonic inservice inspections. Engineering studies were conducted that included experimental validation of computer codes. The basic problem associated with a rough surface in an inservice inspection is that as the transducer rotates slightly to accommodate the rough surface, the beam direction in the metal changes and the time of flight of the echo changes as well. One problem is the excessive weld crown, where weld material protrudes above the adjoining surfaces. In this research this condition is modeled by considering a <b>step</b> <b>discontinuity</b> on the top surface. CNDE developed several models of increasing complexity in order to model an inservice inspection. This report describes the validation of four computer codes. These codes were used to mimic an inservice inspection in order to understand effects associated with rotation of the transducer as it traverses a <b>step</b> <b>discontinuity...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{attenuation}} coefficient and dispersion (frequency dependence of phase velocity) are measured using a phase sensitive (piezoelectric) receiver in a phantom {{in which two}} temporally overlapping signals are detected, analogous to the fast and slow waves typically found in measurements of cancellous bone. The phantom consisted of a flat and parallel Plexiglas™ plate into which a <b>step</b> <b>discontinuity</b> was milled. The phase velocity and attenuation coefficient of the plate were measured using both broadband and narrowband data and were calculated using standard magnitude and phase spectroscopy techniques. The observed frequency dependence of the phase velocity and attenuation coefficient exhibit significant changes in their frequency dependences as the interrogating ultrasonic field is translated across the <b>step</b> <b>discontinuity</b> of the plate. Negative dispersion is observed at specific spatial locations of the plate at which the attenuation coefficient rises linearly with frequency, a behavior analogous to that of bone measurements reported in the literature. For all sites investigated, broadband and narrowband data (3 – 7 MHz) demonstrate excellent consistency. Evidence suggests that the interference between the two signals simultaneously reaching the phase sensitive piezoelectric receiver is responsible for this negative dispersion...|$|E
40|$|This study proposes novel {{optimization}} methodologies for the optimization {{of problems}} that reveal non-physical <b>step</b> <b>discontinuities.</b> More specifically, it is proposed to use gradient-only techniques that do not use any zeroth order information at all for step discontinuous problems. A step discontinuous problem of note is the shape optimization problem {{in the presence of}} remeshing strategies, since changes in mesh topologies may - and normally do - introduce non-physical <b>step</b> <b>discontinuities.</b> These discontinuities may in turn manifest themselves as non-physical local minima in which optimization algorithms may become trapped. Conventional optimization approaches for step discontinuous problems include evolutionary strategies, and design of experiment (DoE) techniques. These conventional approaches typically rely on the exclusive use of zeroth order information to overcome the discontinuities, but are characterized by two important shortcomings: Firstly, the computational demands of zero order methods may be very high, since many function values are in general required. Secondly, the use of zero order information only does not necessarily guarantee that the algorithms will not terminate in highly unfit local minima. In contrast, the methodologies proposed herein use only first order information, rather than only zeroth order information. The motivation for this approach is that associated gradient information in the presence of remeshing remains accurately and uniquely computable, notwithstanding the presence of discontinuities. From a computational effort point of view, a gradient-only approach is of course comparable to conventional gradient based techniques. In addition, the <b>step</b> <b>discontinuities</b> do not manifest themselves as local minima. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.
