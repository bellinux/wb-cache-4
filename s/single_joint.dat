5|$|The {{stations}} partnered {{through a}} sharing agreement may also consolidate their programming operations: local newscasts on the junior {{partner in the}} LMA, if it operated a separate news department before the LMA's formation, may be rescheduled or scaled back to prevent direct competition with newscasts airing on the station acting as the senior partner (the latter aspect is less common with LMAs involving only stations affiliated {{with one of the}} three largest broadcast television networks). The stations may share news-gathering resources, but maintain separate news telecasts that are differentiated by their on-air presentation, anchors, and overall format, with varying degrees of autonomy; in these cases, a seemingly separate newscast on the brokered station in the duopoly may ultimately consist of repackaged news content from the other station.

5|$|The state {{constitution}} has provided since 1777 {{for the election}} of a lieutenant governor, who is also ex officio president of the state senate, to the same term (keeping the same term lengths as the governor throughout all the constitutional revisions). Originally, in the event of the death, resignation or impeachment of the governor, the lieutenant governor would become acting governor {{until the end of the}} yearly legislative term, the office being filled in a special election, if there was a remainder of the term. Since the 1821 constitution, the lieutenant governor explicitly becomes governor upon such vacancy in the office and serves for the entire remainder of the term. Should the office of lieutenant governor become vacant, the president pro tempore of the state senate performs all the duties of the lieutenant governor until the vacancy is filled either at the next gubernatorial election or by appointment. Likewise, should both offices become vacant at the same time, the president pro tempore acts as governor, with the office of lieutenant governor remaining vacant. Should the presidency pro tempore be vacant too, or the incumbent unable to fulfill the duties, the speaker of the assembly is next in the line of succession. The lieutenant governor is elected on the same ticket as the governor, since 1954 with a <b>single</b> <b>joint</b> vote cast for both offices, but is nominated separately.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} of the mechanical properties of bulk adhesive and the behaviour of adhesively bonded <b>single</b> lap <b>joints</b> at room temperature and sub-zero temperatures. The process of making test specimens and performing tests in order to assess the tensile, shear and compressive properties of the bulk adhesive, was followed by extensive numerical modelling of the Iosipescu shear test with the LS-DYNA finite element software to develop and verify the adhesive material model on coupon level. Different measurement methods, e. g. strain gauges and digital image correlation (DIC), were used to obtain accurate strains in the initial linear elastic part of the stress-strain curve and in the yield range for all test temperatures. <b>Single</b> lap <b>joints</b> of aluminium-aluminium and composite-composite adherends were tested to obtain failure loads at room temperature and sub-zero temperatures.

30|$|According to Fig.  4 {{it can be}} {{seen that}} the <b>single</b> lap <b>joint</b> tested at 25  °C with {{adherend}} chemical cleaned had a lower stiffness compared to the other lap joints tested at the same temperature condition. Stiffness of <b>single</b> lap <b>joints</b> manufactured with different surface preparation are not affected by high temperature. The same behavior is observed for specimens exposed to UV radiation, surface preparation does not affect the stiffness for both test temperatures. The elevation of temperature significantly affects maximum force. It also can be observed that sandblasting surface preparation produces a higher brake force and therefore higher shear strength, but it does not improve stiffness. Considering displacement, it is observed that for better surface preparation, sandblasting, higher joint displacement prior to UV exposure. Then, UV exposure contribute to <b>single</b> lap <b>joints</b> lower displacement compared to unexposed ones. The displacement of <b>single</b> lap <b>joints</b> exposed UV radiation is not affected by the temperature exposure producing similar joints stretch for all surface preparation analyzed.|$|R

In a {{unanimous}} judgment, the Court interpreted s 44(i) {{according to the}} [...] "ordinary and natural meaning" [...] of its language. [...] On that approach, it firstly affirmed the view taken in Sykes v Cleary {{that the question of}} eligibility is to be determined with reference to the point of nomination. [...] The Court then followed the reasoning of the majority in Sykes v Cleary. [...] It decided that the fact of citizenship was disqualifying, regardless of whether the person knew of the citizenship or engaged in any voluntary act of acquisition. It emphasised that to hold otherwise would introduce an element of subjectivity that [...] "would be inimical to the stability of representative government". It followed that each of Joyce, Ludlam, Nash, Roberts and Waters had been ineligible to be elected. However, Canavan and Xenophon had been eligible. It was determined that Canavan, under Italian law, was not a citizen of Italy. It was found that Xenophon was a British Overseas citizen, but that this did not give him the right to enter or reside in the United Kingdom; therefore, for the purposes of s 44(i), he was neither a citizen nor entitled to the rights and privileges of a citizen of the United Kingdom. The Court declared the seats of the ineligible members to be vacant; it ordered that the vacancy in the House of Representatives be filled through a by-election and that the vacancies in the Senate be filled by [...] "special counts" [...] (recounts or countbacks) of the ballot papers in each State, subject to supervision by a Justice of the Court.

Water is brought to the houses by little aqueducts formed of large Bamboos split in half and supported on crossed sticks of various heights so as {{to give it a}} regular fall. Thin long-jointed Bamboos form the Dyaks' only water-vessels, and a dozen of them stand in the corner of every house. They are clean, light, and easily carried, and are in many ways superior to earthen vessels for the same purpose. They also make excellent cooking utensils; vegetables and rice can be boiled in them to perfection, and they are often used when travelling. Salted fruit or fish, sugar, vinegar, and honey are preserved in them instead of in jars or bottles. In a small Bamboo case, prettily carved and ornamented, the Dyak carries his sirih and lime for betel chewing, and his little long-bladed knife has a Bamboo sheath. His favourite pipe is a huge hubble-bubble, which he will construct in a few minutes by inserting a small piece of Bamboo for a bowl obliquely into a large cylinder about six inches from the bottom containing water, through which the smoke passes to a long slender Bamboo tube. There are many other small matters for which Bamboo is daily used, but enough has now been mentioned to show its value. In other parts of the Archipelago I have myself seen it applied to many new uses, and it is probable that my limited means of observation did not make me acquainted with one-half the ways in which it is serviceable to the Dyaks of Sarawak.|$|E

It is quite important {{to establish a}} relationship between static strength of a <b>single</b> lap <b>joint</b> and design parameters such as geometrical parameters, material response, type of loading and etc. This paper presents a conceptual design methodology for <b>single</b> lap <b>joints</b> with mild steel adherend S 255 considering geometrical and material parameters. In order to perform this task, ductile (Veropal Super HE- 20) and brittle (Carboresin) two component structural epoxy adhesives are implemented to examine influence of material behavior. <b>Single</b> lap <b>joints</b> are manufactured at various overlap lengths and undergone simple uni-axial tensile tests to identify static tensile strengths. Then a numerical model is created in a commercial finite element package program (ABAQUS™) to make a comparison between experimental and numerical failure loads, which implements well-known maximum value criteria for both adhesive and adherend failure. The results express that the material response and overlap length plays a substantial role in the design stage of bonded structures {{up to a certain}} point. Consequently, strength of a <b>single</b> lap <b>joint</b> is no longer dependent on increase of overlap length at which the failure mechanism is dictated by adherend yielding.
