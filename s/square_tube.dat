40|$|AbstractAuxetic {{materials}} are modern class of materials that {{have recently been}} gaining popularity within the research community due to their enhanced mechanical properties. Unlike conventional materials, they exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio when subjected to a uniaxial loading. This present research experimentally investigates the crush response and energy absorption performances of auxetic foam-filled <b>square</b> <b>tubes</b> under axial loading. For comparison, the crush response and energy absorption of empty and conventional foam-filled <b>squares</b> <b>tubes</b> have also been examined with respect to deformation modes and force displacement curve. Standard compression tests were conducted on a series number of thin-walled tube samples. An additional compression test on conventional and auxetic foam has also been conducted to observe the behavior of foam itself. It is evident that the auxetic foam-filled <b>square</b> <b>tubes</b> are superior to empty and conventional foam-filled <b>square</b> <b>tubes</b> in terms of energy absorption capacity. It shows that such tube is preferable as an impact energy absorber due {{to their ability to}} withstand axial loads effectively. Furthermore, it is found that the load capacity increases as the crush length increases. The primary outcome of this study is design information for the use of auxetic foam-filled <b>square</b> <b>tubes</b> as energy absorbers where impact loading is expected particularly in crashworthiness applications...|$|R

Based on the numerical analyses, maximization problems of dynamic crushing energy absorption of <b>square</b> <b>tubes</b> with and without stiffeners, respectively, are solved using the crashworthiness maximization technique for tubular structures which combined the techniques of design-of-experiment, response surface approximation as well as usual mathematical programming.

40|$|Quasi-static three-point bending {{tests on}} {{sandwich}} beams {{with a series}} of identical thin-walled tubes as core are conducted. Three types of cores are studied, namely, closely arranged identical circular tubes, spaced circular <b>tubes,</b> and spaced <b>square</b> <b>tubes.</b> Relationships between the force and displacement at the mid-span of the sandwich beam are obtained from the experiments. Deformation mechanisms for beams with spaced circular <b>tubes</b> and <b>square</b> <b>tubes</b> are analyzed. FE simulations are also carried out using ABAQUS/EXPLICT and the results are compared well with the experimental and analytical results. Energy absorption and partition are calculated and they match well with the simulation. When the mass of the beams is equal, the smaller the diameter of the tube is, the larger the energy absorption the beam has. Optimized sandwich beam with the <b>square</b> <b>tubes</b> is identified as a more effective structure which has the largest energy absorption of all the structures investigated in this paper...|$|R
5|$|Covent Garden {{is served}} by the Piccadilly line at Covent Garden tube station {{on the corner of}} Long Acre and James Street. The station was {{designed}} by Leslie Green and opened by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway on 11 April 1907, four months after services {{on the rest of the}} line began operating on 15 December 1906. The station is one of the few stations in Central London for which platform access is only by lift or stairs. Until improvements in 2007, due to high passenger numbers (16 million annually), entry to the station was sometimes restricted on busy days to reduce congestion on the platforms. The distance from Covent Garden to Leicester Square at less than 300yards is London's shortest tube journey. Stations just outside the area include the Charing Cross tube station and Charing Cross railway station, Embankment tube station, Leicester <b>Square</b> <b>tube</b> station, and Holborn tube station. While there is only one bus route in Covent Garden itself—the RV1, which uses Catherine Street as a terminus, just to the east of Covent Garden square—there are over 30 routes which pass close by, mostly on the Strand or Kingsway.|$|E

40|$|A plastic {{buckling}} analysis for axially compressed <b>square</b> <b>tubes</b> {{is described in}} this paper. Deformation theory is used together with the realistic edge conditions for the panels of the tube introduced in our previous paper (Li and Reid, 1990), referred to hereafter as LR. The results obtained further our understanding {{of a number of}} problems related to the plastic buckling of axially compressed <b>square</b> <b>tubes</b> and simply supported rectangular plates, which have remained unsolved hitherto and seem rather puzzling. One of these is the discrepancy between experimental results and the results of plastic {{buckling analysis}} performed using the incremental theory of plasticity and the unexpected agreement between the results of calculations based on deformation theory for plates and experimental data obtained from tests con-ducted on tubes. The non-negligible difference between plates and tubes obtained in the present paper suggests that new experiments should be carried out to provide a more accurate assessment of the predictions of the two theories. Discussion of the results herein also advances our understanding of the compact crushing behavior of <b>square</b> <b>tubes</b> beyond that given in LR. An important conclusion reached is that strain hardening cannot be neglected for the plastic buckling analysis of <b>square</b> <b>tubes</b> even if the degree of hardening is small since doing so leads to an unrealistic buckling mode. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{suggests}} {{the introduction of}} patterns {{to the surface of}} conventional thin-walled <b>square</b> <b>tubes</b> to improve the energy absorption capacity under axial compressive loads. A quasi-static axial crushing analysis has been conducted numerically by the nonlinear explicit finite element code LS-DYNA. Two types of patterns constructed using the basic pyramid elements were introduced. Type A pattern was aimed at triggering the extensional mode for relatively thin <b>square</b> <b>tubes</b> whereas type B pattern was intended to develop new collapse mode capable of absorbing more energy during collapse. A total of 30 tubes with a length of 120 mm, thickness 1. 2 mm and widths of 40 or 60 mm were simulated. Numerical results showed that all tubes with type A patterns developed the extensional collapse mode instead of the symmetric collapse mode and absorbed about 15 - 32. 5 % more energy than conventional thin-walled <b>square</b> <b>tubes</b> with a mass increase less than 5 %. Meanwhile, a new collapse mode named octagonal collapse mode was observed for tubes with type B pattern and the energy absorption of tubes developing this mode increased by 54 - 93 % compared with the conventional tube. The influence of various configurations of the patterns on the deformation and energy absorption of the tubes was also discussed. The paper opens up a new avenue in design of high energy absorption components. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} shown that coiled tubes {{geometry}} and nanofluids can passively enhanced heat transfer performance. Now, to maximize the advantages of the heat transfer enhancement, we propose to combine both techniques simultaneously; i.e., employing the combination of coiled tubes filled with nanofluids. Therefore, the aim of the study presented here is threefold: (i) to investigate the heat transfer performance of various configurations of coils of <b>square</b> <b>tubes,</b> e.g., conical spiral, in-plane spiral, and helical spiral, relative to the straight pipe; (ii) to evaluate simultaneous passive heat transfer enhancement-channel geometry and fluid thermo-physical properties-in coiled tubes filled with nanofluids; (iii) to study the heat performance of two different nanofluids, water-Al 2 O 3 and water-CuO, in coiled tubes at various nanoparticle concentrations. The most significant aspect {{of this study is to}} determine the potential advantages and limitations of heat transfer enhancement of coiled of <b>square</b> <b>tubes</b> filled with nanofluids and provide design guidelines for their applications through mathematical modeling.|$|R

The foam-filled thin-walled <b>square</b> <b>tubes</b> are modeled as shell wherein, foam core is modeled by incorporating visco-elastic plastic foam model in Altair® RADIOSSTM. Deformation and energy absorption studies with single, bi-tubular, and tri-tubular structure {{with and without}} aluminum foam core are carried out for assessing its effectiveness in crashworthiness under the identical loading conditions. It is observed that the tri-tubular structure with foam core modify the deformation modes considerably and results in substantial increase in energy absorption capacity {{in comparison with the}} single and tri-tubular structure without foam core. Moreover, the multi-tube foam filled structure shows complicated deformation modes due to the significant effect of stress wave propagation.

40|$|This paper {{treats the}} {{influence}} of auxetic foam on the crush response and energy absorption response of square-section tubes when subjected to uniaxial quasi-static loading. The study aims at quantifying the energy absorption capability of auxetic foam-filled <b>square</b> <b>tubes</b> for variations in wall thickness, initial height, aspect ratio and slenderness ratio of the tube. The capability of simulating the crush response of auxetic foam-filled tubes using the validated numerical models is also presented.
