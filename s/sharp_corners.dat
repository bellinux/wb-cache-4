5|$|Triangular {{curves of}} {{constant}} width with smooth rather than <b>sharp</b> <b>corners</b> {{may be obtained}} as the locus of points at a fixed distance from the Reuleaux triangle. Other generalizations of the Reuleaux triangle include surfaces in three dimensions, curves of constant width with more than three sides, and the Yanmouti sets which provide extreme examples of an inequality between width, diameter, and inradius.|$|E
5|$|After the {{shakeout}} of {{the casting}} it is inspected for defects. The most common defects are misruns and cold shuts. These defects {{can be caused}} by cold dies, low metal temperature, dirty metal, lack of venting, or too much lubricant. Other possible defects are gas porosity, shrinkage porosity, hot tears, and flow marks. Flow marks are marks left {{on the surface of the}} casting due to poor gating, <b>sharp</b> <b>corners,</b> or excessive lubricant.|$|E

5|$|Transforming a curve {{with equal}} normal speeds at all points {{has been called}} the grassfire transform. Curves evolved in this way will in general develop <b>sharp</b> <b>corners,</b> the trace of which forms the medial axis of the curve. A closely related curve {{evolution}} which moves straight segments of a polygonal curve at equal speeds but allows concave corners to move more quickly than unit speed instead forms a different type of topological skeleton of the given curve, its straight skeleton.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time as the realignments in Michigan, two-lane {{bypasses}} of Manitowoc and Port Washington in Wisconsin were opened in 1957. The state built a divided-highway segment that opened the following year running from the Milwaukee area northward to the Ozaukee–Milwaukee county line. The highway was rerouted to run further inland, bypassing Haven, Wisconsin, in 1959. In late 1961, the highway in Michigan was rebuilt in northern Iron and southern Baraga counties between Amasa and Covington as the state smoothed out <b>sharp</b> <b>corners</b> in the routing and finished paving US141; a similar project was completed in 1972 south of Amasa to Crystal Falls.|$|E

25|$|Katakana are {{characterized}} by short, straight strokes and <b>sharp</b> <b>corners,</b> and are the simplest of the Japanese scripts. There are two main systems of ordering katakana: the old-fashioned iroha ordering, and the more prevalent gojūon ordering.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sharp</b> <b>corners</b> {{wear out}} more quickly, and could {{possibly}} reveal the card's value, {{so they were}} replaced with rounded corners. Before the mid-19th century, British, American, and French players preferred blank backs. The need to hide wear and tear and to discourage writing on the back led cards to have designs, pictures, photos, or advertising on the reverse.|$|E

25|$|In {{die casting}} {{the most common}} defects are misruns and cold shuts. These defects {{can be caused by}} cold dies, low metal temperature, dirty metal, lack of venting, or too much lubricant. Other {{possible}} defects are gas porosity, shrinkage porosity, hot tears, and flow marks. Flow marks are marks left {{on the surface of the}} casting due to poor gating, <b>sharp</b> <b>corners,</b> or excessive lubricant.|$|E
25|$|Creep {{can cause}} gradual {{cut-through}} of wire insulation, especially when stress is concentrated by pressing insulated wire against a sharp edge or corner. Special creep-resistant insulations such as Kynar (polyvinylidene fluoride) {{are used in}} wirewrap applications to resist cut-through due to the <b>sharp</b> <b>corners</b> of wire wrap terminals. Teflon insulation is resistant to elevated temperatures and has other desirable properties, but is notoriously vulnerable to cold-flow cut-through failures caused by creep.|$|E
25|$|Betting was heavy, with Cummings favoured over George. At the gun, George dashed ahead, with Cummings close behind, in {{a steady}} rain. Cummings, who had won the coin toss, had chosen the third-of-a-mile {{rectangular}} cinder track at the site over the favoured quarter-mile cycling track. At the quarter mile point of the race, hindered by the slow track with <b>sharp</b> <b>corners,</b> George led with 58, a torrid pace which the crowd enthusiastically cheered.|$|E

25|$|Conventional {{twist drill}} bits tend to wander when {{presented}} to a flat workpiece. For metalwork, this is countered by drilling a pilot hole with a spotting drill bit. In wood, the lip and spur drill bit is another solution: The {{centre of the}} drill bit is given not the straight chisel of the twist drill bit, but a spur with a sharp point and four <b>sharp</b> <b>corners</b> to cut the wood. The sharp point of the spur simply pushes into the soft wood to keep the drill bit in line.|$|E
25|$|Stones whose {{outlines}} {{are either}} square or rectangular and whose facets are rectilinear and arranged {{parallel to the}} girdle are known as step- or trap-cut stones. These stones often have their corners truncated, creating an emerald cut (after its most common application to emerald gemstones) with an octagonal outline. This is done because <b>sharp</b> <b>corners</b> are points of weakness where a diamond may cleave or fracture. Instead of a culet, step-cut stones have a keel running {{the length of the}} pavilion terminus. Like other fancy shaped diamonds, emerald cut diamonds can {{come in a variety of}} length to width ratios. The most popular and classic outline of emerald cut diamonds are close a value of 1.5.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the first}} boiler tubes, {{particularly}} the du Temple with its <b>sharp</b> <b>corners,</b> could not be cleaned of scale internally. Tubes were later cleaned internally by attempting to pass a hinged rod through, with a brush at the end. For the curved tube designs, often {{only part of the}} tube could be reached. Another method was to pass a chain down the tube from above, pulling a brush behind it, although this was unworkable for boilers like the Thornycroft where the tubes first travelled horizontally or upwards. The eventual method was to use 'bullet' brushes that were fired from one drum into the other by use of compressed air. Sets of brushes were used, one for each tube, and they were carefully numbered and counted afterwards to ensure that none had been left behind, blocking a tube.|$|E

5000|$|Positional {{continuity}} (G0) holds {{whenever the}} end positions of two curves or surfaces coincide. The curves or surfaces may still meet at an angle, {{giving rise to}} a <b>sharp</b> <b>corner</b> or edge and causing broken highlights.|$|R
25|$|Hamburg is {{the longest}} {{standing}} venue on the series, having hosted international events since 2002 including the 2007 World Championships. The course has athletes dive into an artificial lake for the swim, where they complete two 750-metre laps, but have to exit the water to complete a 180-degree turn after the first lap. The bike section is technically challenging with eight <b>sharp</b> <b>corners</b> {{near the bottom of}} the 5km circuit which is lapped eight times. The run section has competitors complete four 2.5km laps; however, there is a hazard as there are two 180-degree turns on each end of the course. Both Brownlee brothers missed the event, as did Paula Findlay and Helen Jenkins. Findlay missed the event with a hip injury which forced her to pull out of her home World Cup event in Edmonton.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, a US$44 million {{renovation}} of the complex began. The goal was to reduce congestion and improve rider access, comfort and safety by improving visual lines and increasing pedestrian capacity. The main corridor was widened , {{and the number of}} <b>sharp</b> <b>corners</b> reduced; ADA accessibility was introduced with elevators; new escalators; and other corridors were widened. The mezzanine above the BMT Broadway Line, formerly a record shop, now features a large oval balcony looking over the trackway and has reduced the sense of claustrophobia described by many riders. In 2004, four unisex stall bathrooms were opened on the mezzanine between the IRT and BMT lines; they are staffed and maintained by employees of the Times Square Alliance, the local Business Improvement District. The record shop re-opened in 2007 {{on the south side of}} the IRT/BMT corridor.|$|E

Here, NY43 intersects NY22 at a junction that features <b>sharp</b> <b>corners</b> for commuters turning onto NY43 from NY22. Past NY22, NY43 heads southeast through mostly open fields and lightly populated areas to the Massachusetts state line, where the roadway becomes Route43 upon crossing into Hancock, Massachusetts.|$|E
