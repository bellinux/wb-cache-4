40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the {{efficacy}} of an experimental diamine <b>silver</b> fluoride/potassium <b>iodide</b> product with an oxalic acid-based preparation in reducing dentine hypersensitivity. METHODS: The study was conducted as a double-blind, randomized clinical trial. A total of 19 subjects with dentine hypersensitivity on both sides of their upper arch were selected. The most sensitive tooth in each quadrant was identified and received a cold stimulus. The response was recorded on a visual analogue scale (VAS). The tooth thus selected was treated with one of the treatment agents. One week later the level of dentine sensitivity was assessed. Participants were also asked for their subjective assessment of treatment effects. RESULTS: The mean difference between VAS at baseline and seven days for teeth treated with diamine <b>silver</b> fluoride/potassium <b>iodide</b> was greater than that for teeth treated with the oxalic acid-based preparation (p = 0. 0134). The subjects’ subjective assessment of changes in dentine hypersensitivity indicated that more obtained relief with the diamine <b>silver</b> fluoride/potassium <b>iodide</b> treatment (p = 0. 0129). CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that an experimental diamine <b>silver</b> fluoride/potassium <b>iodide</b> product has potential as a treatment for dentine hypersensitivity. G. G. Craig, G. M.

5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States {{government}} {{attempted to}} weaken hurricanes through Project Stormfury by seeding selected storms with <b>silver</b> <b>iodide.</b> It {{was thought that}} the seeding would cause supercooled water in the outer rainbands to freeze, causing the inner eyewall to collapse and thus reducing the winds. The winds of Hurricane Debbie—a hurricane seeded in Project Stormfury—dropped as much as 31%, but Debbie regained its strength after each of two seeding forays. In an earlier episode in 1947, disaster struck when a hurricane east of Jacksonville, Florida promptly changed its course after being seeded, and smashed into Savannah, Georgia. Because {{there was so much}} uncertainty about the behavior of these storms, the federal government would not approve seeding operations unless the hurricane had a less than 10% chance of making landfall within 48 hours, greatly reducing the number of possible test storms. The project was dropped after it was discovered that eyewall replacement cycles occur naturally in strong hurricanes, casting doubt on the result of the earlier attempts. Today, it is known that <b>silver</b> <b>iodide</b> seeding is not likely to have an effect because the amount of supercooled water in the rainbands of a tropical cyclone is too low.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{was that the}} <b>silver</b> <b>iodide</b> would cause supercooled water in the storm to freeze, disrupting the inner structure of the hurricane. This led to the seeding of several Atlantic hurricanes. However, it was later shown that this {{hypothesis was}} incorrect. It was determined that most hurricanes do not contain enough supercooled water for cloud seeding to be effective. Additionally, researchers found that unseeded hurricanes often undergo the same structural changes that were expected from seeded hurricanes. This finding called Stormfury's successes into question, as the changes reported now had a natural explanation.|$|E

5|$|While {{over the}} western Atlantic Ocean, Ginger became the last target of Project Stormfury, {{which sought to}} weaken hurricanes by {{depositing}} <b>silver</b> <b>iodide</b> into tropical cyclone rainbands. Ginger ultimately struck North Carolina on September30 as a minimal hurricane, lashing the coastline with gusty winds that caused power outages across the region. Heavy rainfall flooded towns and left severe crop damage, with 3million bushels of corn and 1million bushels of soybean lost. Damage in the state was estimated at $10million (1971US dollars, $ USD). Further north, moderate precipitation and winds spread through the Mid-Atlantic states, although no significant damage was reported outside North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|With {{regard to}} hurricanes, it was {{hypothesized}} that by seeding the area around the eyewall with <b>silver</b> <b>iodide,</b> latent heat would be released. This would promote the formation of a new eyewall. As this new eyewall was larger than the old eyewall, the winds of the tropical cyclone would be weaker due to a reduced pressure gradient. Even a small reduction in the speed of a hurricane's winds would be beneficial: since the damage potential of a hurricane increased as the square of the wind speed, a slight lowering of wind speed would have a large reduction in destructiveness.|$|E

Silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation, but the application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption.

5|$|Hurricane Debbie was {{an intense}} and {{long-lived}} hurricane that formed during August 1969. The fifth tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, third hurricane and second major hurricane of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season, Debbie formed on August 14 {{in the southern}} Atlantic Ocean and took a general northwesterly path until turning northward into the central Atlantic. The storm was characterized by numerous fluctuations in intensity, and it reached winds corresponding to Category 3 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale on four separate occasions. The hurricane bypassed the island of Bermuda to the southeast on August 22, before ultimately brushing southeastern Newfoundland with strong winds.

Afterward, Ginger slowly weakened, and late on September 30 it made landfall near Morehead City, North Carolina, with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). It quickly deteriorated over land, weakening first to a tropical storm and then to a tropical depression by late on October 1. Ginger turned to the north, entered southern Virginia, and later turned to the east. On October 3, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while crossing Hampton Roads into the Atlantic Ocean. The remnants of Ginger continued east-southeastward until being absorbed by a cold front on October 5.|$|E
40|$|The {{selective}} {{removal of}} halide fission products from an aqueous solution by exchange with the halide in a solid silver halide was studied {{as the basis}} for a fuel-element leak detector. The retention of fission-product halides on a silver halide column was investigated as a function of coolant flow rate, halide anion, and column size.

This thesis {{reports on the}} development of a new portable battery-powered flow injection potentiometric (FIP) system suitable for remote-site monitoring that can utilise a range of ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) or arrays of coated-wire electrodes (CWEs) as detectors. A number of different designs were developed and evaluated for a variety of applications. Portable FIP systems employing: (1) a commercial iodide ISE as a single electrode detector, and (2) a tungsten / tungsten-oxide wire electrode employed as a pH sensor were initially developed. The performance of the iodide electrode exhibited near-Nernstian response over a wide concentration range in the FIP mode. The tungsten / tungsten-oxide electrode exhibited a subNernstian response between the pH range 2 and 11, and was used to determine the pH of various samples in the FIP mode. Three commercial planar type ISEs (nitrate, potassium and sodium) were arranged in a three-ISE array and used in the portable FIP system. The potassium and sodium ISEs exhibited Nernstian responses, while the nitrate ISE exhibited a near-Nernstian response. The accuracy of the ISE-array was studied and validation of this system was performed with various mineral water samples in the FIP mode.

40|$|Aims: The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to {{comparatively}} evaluate the microshear bond strength (MSBS) of etch-and-rinse and self-etch (ER and SE) bonding systems to dentin pretreated with <b>silver</b> diamine fluoride/potassium <b>iodide</b> (SDF/KI) and nanoleakage at the resin-dentin interface using transmission electron microscope (TEM). Subjects and Methods: Seventy-two dentin slabs of 3 mm thickness were prepared from extracted human permanent third molars and divided into four groups (n = 18) based on the dentin surface treatment as follows: (1) ER adhesive bonding without dentin pretreatment; (2) SDF/KI pretreatment of dentin followed by ER adhesive bonding; (3) SE adhesive bonding without dentin pretreatment; and (4) SDF/KI pretreatment of dentin followed by SE adhesive bonding. Resin composite {{was built on the}} dentin slabs to a height of 4 mm incrementally, and dentin-composite beams of approximately 1 mm 2 cross-sectional area were prepared. The beams were subjected to MSBS analysis, and the fractured surface was observed under scanning electron microscope to determine the mode of failure. The resin-dentin interface was examined under TEM for evaluation of nanoleakage. Statistical Analysis Used: One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey′s post hoc multiple comparison tests. Results: Pretreatment of dentin with SDF/KI increased the MSBS of ER and SE adhesives, though not statistically significant, except between Groups 2 and 3. In all the groups, the predominant mode of failure was adhesive followed by cohesive in resin, mixed and cohesive in dentin. TEM examination of resin-dentin interface showed that pretreatment with 38 % SDF/KI reduced nanoleakage regardless of the type of bonding system used.

5|$|Most of the iodides of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, {{along with}} the {{lanthanides}} and actinides in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular iodides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. Ionic iodides MIn tend to have the lowest melting and boiling points among the halides MXn of the same element, because the electrostatic forces of attraction between the cations and anions are weakest for the large iodide anion. In contrast, covalent iodides tend to instead have the highest melting and boiling points among the halides of the same element, since iodine is the most polarisable of the halogens and, having the most electrons among them, can contribute the most to van der Waals forces. Naturally, exceptions abound in intermediate iodides where one trend {{gives way to the}} other. Similarly, solubilities in water of predominantly ionic iodides (e.g. potassium and calcium) are the greatest among ionic halides of that element, while those of covalent iodides (e.g. silver) are the lowest of that element.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the ascorbate-activated cleavage of sinigrin to mustard oil has been postulated as enzymatic hydrolysis of the thioglucoside to the aglucone, which undergoes spontaneous Lossen rearrangement to allyl isothiocyanate. Potassium silver sinigrate (I) served as a convenient source of the aglucone (II) for comparison. When the potassium salt was decomposed with iodide at pH 2, 97 % of the product was allyl cyanide; at pH 5, 97 % was allyl isothiocyanate; and at pH 3. 53, the two compounds were formed in equal amounts. The ratio of nitrile to isothiocyanate was proportional to hydrogen ion concentration. Enzymatic hydrolysis of sinigrin at pH 3. 2 - 5, with or without ascorbate, gave essentially the same product distribution. Treatment of potassium silver sinigrate with hydrogen cyanide at pH 6. 6 allowed spectroscopic observation of the aglucone. It (II) has an ultraviolet absorption maximum at 245 mu, E 11, 000, and a half-life of 37 seconds at 20 ° (estimated 1 minutes at 0 °). These results agree with data for and the resulting aglucone either undergoes Lossen rearrangement or is captured by another enzyme ("thiocyanase") and converted to allyl thiocyanate. Isothiocyanate once formed is not isomerized.

Studies on the silver-iodide complexes are reported in section 3. 1. In dilute solutions of <b>silver</b> and alkali <b>iodides</b> in organic solvents, absorption bands occur at c. 230 mu and C. 310 mu, and are attributable to the species AgI 2 and Ag[.;I.;" respectively. Thediffuse reflectance of the solid complexes are also reported. Further, preliminary electron spin resonance studies of the gamma irradiated solid complexes are reported. In section 3. 2, it is demonstrated that the centres in irradiated silver halides which give rise to a conduction electron spin resonance cannot be silver particles. Gamma irradiation at low temperatures does not seem to give rise to simple paramagnetic colour centres as in the alkali halides. Gyanine dyed silver halides, illuminated at low temperature, show a single electron spin resonance, with a g-value slightly dependent on the halide. The results of Stasiw on chalcogen doped silver halides are discussed and some experimental studies are reported. In section 3. 3, magnetic resonance data on the F-centre (from the literature) is analysed to show the dependence of the density of the unpaired electron in orbitals of near neighbour cations on various parameters of the alkali halide. In particular this density is seen to decrease linearly with increasing halide (cavity) radius and increase with the covalent radius of the alkali metal. The importance of cavity size is stressed and implications for any theory of the P-centre are discussed. Some measurements of the absorption of iodide doped crystals are presented...|$|R

Since the new eyewall was outside the original one, the first eyewall would be choked of energy and fall apart.
