500|$|Series writer Amy Hennig {{designed}} Frazer {{to act as}} a foil to Drake, as such, she acts {{to highlight}} various parts of his personality. She contrasts to other main characters, and is essentially a darker version of Drake, and the [...] "bad girl" [...] version of Elena. Frazer is a professional thief, and often acts impulsively. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> for herself above all other people. She is a strong female character, and is very sexually forward compared to other women in video games. Tom Cross of Gamasutra commented that she was perhaps a first in video games as a confident woman every bit the equal of the lead male character.|$|E
500|$|The {{girl has}} pale skin, almond and {{slightly}} oriental {{eyes and a}} petulant mouth. She reflects the Gothic ideal of elongated facial features, narrow shoulders, tightly pinned hair and an almost unnaturally long forehead, achieved through tightly pulled-back hair which has been plucked at the top. [...] She is dressed in expensive clothing and jewellery {{and seems to be}} uncommonly elegant. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> of the canvas in an oblique but self-aware and penetrating manner that some art historians have described as unnerving. Joanna Woods-Marsden remarks that a sitter acknowledging her audience in this way was virtually unprecedented even in Italian portrait painting. Her acknowledgment is accentuated by the painting's crop, which focuses the viewer's gaze in a near-invasive manner that seems to question the relationship between artist, model, patron and viewer.|$|E
2500|$|Leela refuses Fry's entreaties {{to let him}} out of the dungeon. Instead he escapes, and he and Bender {{break into}} the Forbidden Valley. They {{discover}} four other castles, identical except that the decorations depict different species. They return and interrupt Leela's wedding, bringing with them four women, each of a different species, and each scheduled to be married to Alcazar on the same day as Leela. Alcazar, flustered, involuntarily reveals his true nature as a shape-shifting, cricket-like alien. After the women beat him into submission, he explains that he played with their emotions in order to sell viewings of their sexual relations to voyeurs, and that he had to stage all the weddings on one day because tuxedos that change shape are expensive to rent. Leela leaves {{with the rest of the}} Planet Express crew. The Professor tells Leela she will have plenty of years to search for her true home while paying for the popcorn shipment she destroyed, but Leela disconsolately wonders [...] "How many planets could there be?" [...] as <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> at a vast, starry space.|$|E

She yawns; then she looks towards the tall glass; then <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> at the weather, mooning her great black eyes, and fixing them on the sky as if they stuck there, while my tongue goes flick-flack along, {{a hundred and fifty}} words a minute; then she looks at the clock; then she asks me what I've been reading.' ...|$|E

60|$|In a villa on the westward {{shore of}} the Isle of Wight, the glass doors which lead from the drawing-room to the garden are yet open. The shaded lamp yet burns on the table. A lady sits by the lamp, reading. From time to time <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> into the garden, and sees the white-robed figure {{of a young girl}} pacing slowly to and fro in the soft {{brightness}} of the moonlight on the lawn. Sorrow and suspense have set their mark on the lady. Not rivals only, but friends who formerly admired her, agree now that she looks worn and aged. The more merciful judgment of others remarks, with equal truth, that her eyes, her hair, her simple grace and grandeur of movement have lost but little of their olden charms. The truth lies, as usual, between the two extremes. In spite of sorrow and suffering, Mrs. Crayford is the beautiful Mrs. Crayford still.|$|E
6000|$|There is no novelty in the Mpongwe funeral rites; {{the same}} system {{prevails}} from the Oil Rivers to Congo-land, and extends even to the wild races of the interior. The corpse, being still sentient, is accompanied by stores of raiment, pots, and goats' flesh; a bottle is placed {{in one hand and}} a glass in the other, and, if the deceased has been fond of play, his draught-board and other materials are buried with him. The system has been well defined as one in which the [...] "ghost of a man eats the ghost of a yam, boiled in the ghost of a pot, over the ghost of a fire." [...] The body, after being stretched out in a box, is carried to a lonely place; some are buried deep, others close to the surface. There is an immense show of grief, with keening and crocodiles' tears, perhaps to benefit the living by averting a charge of witchcraft, which would inevitably lead to [...] "Sassy" [...] or poison-water. The wake continues for five days, when they [...] "pull the cry," [...] that is to say, end mourning. If these pious rites be neglected, the children incur the terrible reproach, [...] "Your father he be hungry." [...] The widow may re-marry immediately after [...] "living for cry," [...] and, if young and lusty, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> for another consort within the week. The slave is thrown out into the bush--no one will take the trouble to dig a hole for him.|$|E
60|$|NEXT YEAR.--We {{have named}} it Cain. She caught it while I was up country {{trapping}} on the North Shore of the Erie; caught {{it in the}} timber {{a couple of miles}} from our dug-out--or it might have been four, she isn't certain which. It resembles us in some ways, and may be a relation. That is what she thinks, but this is an error, in my judgment. The difference in size warrants the conclusion that it is a different and new kind of animal--a fish, perhaps, though when I put it in the water to see, it sank, and she plunged in and snatched it out before there was opportunity for the experiment to determine the matter. I still think it is a fish, but she is indifferent about what it is, and will not let me have it to try. I do not understand this. The coming of the creature seems to have changed her whole nature and made her unreasonable about experiments. She thinks more of it than she does of any of the other animals, but is not able to explain why. Her mind is disordered--everything shows it. Sometimes she carries the fish in her arms half the night when it complains and wants to get to the water. At such times the water comes out of the places in her face that <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> of, and she pats the fish on the back and makes soft sounds with her mouth to soothe it, and betrays sorrow and solicitude in a hundred ways. I have never seen her do like this with any other fish, and it troubles me greatly. She used to carry the young tigers around so, and play with them, before we lost our property, but it was only play; she never took on about them like this when their dinner disagreed with them.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am thinking," [...] said Laura, {{blushing}} and bowing her head--"I am thinking, if it pleases God {{to give me}} children, I {{should like}} to live at home at Fairoaks." [...] My wife's thoughts, though she did not utter them, and a certain modesty and habitual awe kept her silent upon subjects so very sacred, went deeper yet. She had been bred to measure her actions by a standard which the world may nominally admit, but which it leaves {{for the most part}} unheeded. Worship, love, duty, as taught her by the devout study of the Sacred Law which interprets and defines it--if these formed the outward practice of her life, they were also its constant and secret endeavours and occupation. She spoke but very seldom of her religion, though it filled her heart and influenced all her behaviour. Whenever she came to that sacred subject, her demeanour appeared to her husband so awful that he scarcely dared to approach it in her company, and stood without as this pure creature entered into the Holy of Holies. What must the world appear to such a person? Its ambitious rewards, disappointments, pleasures, worth how much? Compared to the possession of that priceless treasure and happiness unspeakable, a perfect faith, what has Life to offer? I see before me now her sweet grave face, as <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> from the balcony of the little Richmond villa we occupied during the first happy year after our marriage, following Ethel Newcome, who rides away, with a staid groom behind her, to her brother's summer residence, not far distant. Clive had been with us in the morning, and had brought us stirring news. The good Colonel was by this time on his way home. [...] "If Clive could tear himself away from London," [...] the good man wrote (and we thus saw he was acquainted with the state of the young man's mind), [...] "why should not Clive go and meet his father at Malta?" [...] He was feverish and eager to go; and his two friends strongly counselled him to take the journey. In the midst of our talk Miss Ethel came among us. She arrived flushed and in high spirits; she rallied Clive upon his gloomy looks; she turned rather pale, as it seemed to us, when she heard the news. Then she coldly told him she thought the voyage must be a pleasant one, and would do him good: it was pleasanter than that journey she was going to take herself with her dreary grandmother, to those German springs which the old Countess frequented year after year. Mr. Pendennis having business, retired to his study, whither presently Mrs. Laura followed, having to look for her scissors, or a book she wanted, or upon some pretext or other. She sate down in the conjugal study; not one word did either of us say for a while about the young people left alone in the drawing-room yonder. Laura talked about our own home at Fairoaks, which our tenants were about to vacate. She vowed and declared that we must live at Fairoaks; that Clavering, with all its tittle-tattle and stupid inhabitants, was better than this wicked London. Besides, there were some new and very pleasant families settled in the neighbourhood. Clavering Park was taken by some delightful people--"and you know, Pen, you were always very fond of fly-fishing, and may fish the Brawl, as you used in old days, when--" [...] The lips of the pretty satirist who alluded to these unpleasant bygones were silenced as they deserved to be by Mr. Pendennis. [...] "Do you think, sir, I did not know," [...] says the sweetest voice in the world, [...] "when you went out on your fishing excursions with Miss Amory?" [...] Again the flow of words is checked by the styptic previously applied.|$|E
60|$|For {{the other}} house, {{the house we}} most haunted after our own, was that of our cousin Albert, still another of the blest orphans, though this time of our mother's kindred; {{and if it was}} my habit, as I have hinted, to {{attribute}} to orphans as orphans a circumstantial charm, a setting necessarily more delightful than our father'd and mother'd one, so there spread about this appointed comrade, the perfection of the type, inasmuch as he alone was neither brother'd nor sister'd, an air of possibilities that were none the less vivid for being quite indefinite. He was to embody in due course, poor young man, some of these possibilities--those that had originally been for me the vaguest of all; but to fix his situation from my present view is not so much to wonder that it spoke to me of a wild freedom as to see in it the elements of a rich and rounded picture. The frame was still there but a short time since, cracked and empty, broken and gaping, like those few others, of the general overgrown scene, that my late quest had puzzled out; and this has somehow helped me to read back into it the old figures and the old long story, told as with excellent art. We knew the figures well while they lasted and had with them the happiest relation, but without doing justice to their truth of outline, their felicity of character and force of expression and function, above all to the compositional harmony in which they moved. That lives again to my considering eyes, and I admire as never before the fine artistry of fate. Our cousin's guardian, the natural and the legal, was his aunt, his only one, who was the cousin of our mother and our own aunt, virtually our only one, so far as a felt and adopted closeness of kinship went; and the three, daughters of two sole and much-united sisters, had been so brought up together as to have quite all the signs and accents of the same strain and the same nest. The cousin Helen of our young prospect was thus all but the sister Helen of our mother's lifetime, as was to happen, and was scarcely less a stout brave presence and an emphasised character for the new generation than for the old; noted here as she is, in particular, for her fine old-time value of clearness and straightness. I see in her strong simplicity, that of an earlier, quieter world, a New York of better manners and better morals and homelier beliefs, the very elements of some portrait by a grave Dutch or other truth-seeking master; <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> with some of the strong marks, the anxious honesty, the modest humour, the folded resting hands, the dark handsome serious attire, the important composed cap, almost the badge of a guild or an order, that hang together about the images of past worthies, of whichever sex, who have had, as one may say, the courage of their character, and qualify them for places in great collections. I note with appreciation that she was strenuously, actively good, and have the liveliest impression both that no one was ever better, and that her goodness somehow testifies for the whole tone of a society, a remarkable cluster of private decencies. Her value to my imagination is even most of all perhaps in her mere local consistency, her fine old New York ignorance and rigour. Her traditions, scant but stiff, had grown there, close to her--they were all she needed, and she lived by them candidly and stoutly. That there have been persons so little doubtful of duty helps to show us how societies grow. A proportionately small amount of absolute conviction about it will carry, we thus make out, a vast dead weight of mere comparative. She was as anxious over hers indeed as if it had ever been in question--which is a proof perhaps that being void of imagination, when you are quite entirely void, makes scarcely more for comfort than having too much, which only makes in a manner for a homeless freedom or even at the worst for a questioned veracity. With a big installed conscience there is virtue in a grain of the figurative faculty--it acts as oil to the stiff machine.|$|E
