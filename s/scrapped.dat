40|$|By {{means of}} a ‘Cycle of Matter’ model a {{comprehensive}} <b>scrap</b> cycle can be estimated for a region, country or continent. The model covers <b>scrap</b> flows between the three main actors defining the cycle, i. e. <b>scrap</b> users, <b>scrap</b> generators and <b>scrap</b> dealers. The ‘Cycle of Matter’ incorporates the generation and use of three types of <b>scrap,</b> i. e. home <b>scrap,</b> prompt <b>scrap</b> and obsolete <b>scrap.</b> It allows for a better assessment {{of the impact of}} government policies regarding <b>scrap</b> recycling {{in various parts of the}} <b>scrap</b> cycle. This paper presents the main results of a detailed study of the national <b>scrap</b> recycling industry of a developing country, Tanzania. The <b>scrap</b> flows in the ‘Cycle of Matter’ model were estimated on the basis of specially tailored surveys amongst <b>scrap</b> users, producers and traders, and on the basis of secondary data and coefficients derived from the literature. The paper demonstrates that the model is a powerful tool for the analysis of the <b>scrap</b> cycle. The study reveals that Tanzania possesses large surpluses of <b>scrap.</b> These surpluses are increasing over time. The <b>scrap</b> users — foundries and steel mills — are not capable of utilising all available <b>scrap.</b> Large quantities of <b>scrap</b> are thus either dumped in the environment or transferred abroad. Foundries and steel mills will only be able to make better use of existing <b>scrap</b> surpluses if they succeed in upgrading their quality of their production processes...|$|R

Considering the steel <b>scrap</b> formation, the three major groups are elaborated: own <b>scrap</b> or circulation <b>scrap,</b> processing <b>scrap</b> and amortization <b>scrap.</b> The balancing model for estimating of steel <b>scrap</b> creation is based on the calculating the coefficients of the generation circulation, processing and amortization <b>scrap,</b> which are used as the basis for successful modelling...|$|R

Depreciation-based <b>scrap</b> rates One way to calculate <b>scrap</b> rates is {{to make use of}} depreciation rates. With cumulative depreciation from equation (1) and depreciation from equation (5), <b>scrap</b> values (the original value of decommissioned fixed assets) follow in equation (4); <b>scrap</b> rates are obtained by inserting the <b>scrap</b> value in equation (3).

40|$|This project {{deals with}} the {{experimentation}} which took place at a cable manufacturing company. The thesis describes and summarizes the various strategies and techniques that has been applied and practiced for <b>scrap</b> reduction.

DMAIC help to identify areas in process where extra expense exist, identify the biggest impact factor related production expenses, introduce appropriate measurement system, optimize process and reduce production cost and time. Many issues were detected by the production, such as a lack of a unified procedure for documenting <b>scrap,</b> as well as cable manufacturing concerns suggested by new and experienced operators. Another concern was how best to focus on insulated wire <b>scraps,</b> the reason for <b>scraps</b> and how to correct such things and prevention. The research task of accurately measuring the <b>scrap</b> by improving <b>scrap</b> logistic proved to be very successful in order to measure <b>scrap</b> accurately.

40|$|The <b>scrap</b> metal {{industry}} {{is part of}} the broader recycling industry that involves the collection,separation and processing of materials for manufacture into raw materials or new products. The demand for <b>scrap</b> metal is a derived demand – based on the demand for steel because <b>scrap</b> metal is an input to steel production. Steel demand in turn is based on demand by construction,manufacturing and other industrial sectors. Hence prices for <b>scrap</b> metal are a function of prices for steel. <b>Scrap</b> metal is an international commodity market – Australia is essentially a price taker and prices are set in global markets based on demand and supply factors. Prices of <b>scrap</b> metal in Australia are essentially set by the world price. Estimates of the sensitivity of Australian (or even global) <b>scrap</b> metal prices to global economic conditions are difficult to find. Nonetheless, one implicit estimate for Australia is that a 1 per cent fall in demand for <b>scrap</b> metal results in a fall in domestic <b>scrap</b> metal prices of 0. 46 per cent. Nonetheless estimates of the price sensitivity of <b>scrap</b> metal to demand and global economic conditions can be highly volatile. Evidence suggests global <b>scrap</b> metal prices regularly halve and double over the period of 18 - 24 months. ...|$|R
