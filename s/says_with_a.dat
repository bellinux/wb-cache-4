500|$|May {{we suggest}} that the most {{appropriate}} resting place for the rejected work of art is the Home for Lost Dogs at Battersea, where it could be [...] "done to death", as the inscription <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hammer {{in the presence of}} Miss Woodword, the Rev. Lionel S. Lewis, and other friends; if their feelings were too much for them, doubtless an anaesthetic could be administered.|$|E
500|$|Marie: Julien visits Marie and Simon's old apartment, {{where the}} letting agent shows him {{a room that}} Julien chillingly {{recognises}} — it {{is identical to the}} room Marie has prepared. This is where Marie hanged herself, trying to frame Simon in revenge after a terrible row. Julien returns home and Marie silently leads him to the attic where she has prepared a noose, feeling she has to hang herself again. Julien carries her downstairs, and they make love again. She leaves to meet Adrienne, who says that she knows that Marie no longer wants to die. They agree they do not know the rules of their situation. Returning, Marie interrupts Julien about to hang himself {{in a desperate attempt to}} join her. He runs to the kitchen and tries to slit his wrist; Marie stops him and her wrist and his palm are cut. Marie warns him that he will lose all memory of her, but he says that all he wants is for her to be there. Marie slowly covers her face with her hands —"the forbidden sign"— and Julien becomes oblivious to her and unaware of why he is bleeding. Madame X arrives for her letter and he hands it over, confused by her enquiries about [...] "l'autre personne". Madame X burns the letter, freeing Adrienne. Marie cries while watching Julien sleep, and as her tears land on her wrist her cut bleeds. Julien wakes and asks who she is; she replies that she is [...] "the one he loved". He doubts it as she's [...] "not his type", but she <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> smile to give her a little time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good afternoon," [...] {{said the}} stranger, {{regarding}} him--as Mr. Henfrey <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vivid {{sense of the}} dark spectacles--"like a lobster." ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>saying,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> laugh, Lisle put on {{his helmet}} and went out.|$|R
60|$|So <b>saying,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{peremptory}} wave of {{his hand}} he dismissed his nephew.|$|R
60|$|So <b>saying,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sudden quick {{movement}} {{he got his}} hook round Thorvold's neck.|$|R
6000|$|The divine <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> faint blush--"It is--ah--it is Mrs. Sherrick and Miss Sherrick {{who have}} done me the favour to come to luncheon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Toby," [...] he <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> quiet smile, [...] "the {{little man}} will now walk three times round the Cairawan, and retire behind the curtain." ...|$|E
6000|$|Edith, in compassion, {{bends over}} her and speaks to her. The sick old woman {{clutches}} her round the neck, and <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> look of horror, ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>saying,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bow he left them, {{and again}} {{advanced}} to the castle gate.|$|R
60|$|So <b>saying,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{bow to the}} courtiers he {{left the}} room, {{followed}} by Kennedy.|$|R
25|$|A {{spinning}} non-axisymmetric planetoid — <b>say</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large bump or dimple on {{the equator}} — will radiate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Maidens talk ever thus," [...] {{said the}} King; [...] "but when the favoured lover presses his suit, she <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sigh, her stars had decreed otherwise." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{with this}} Miss Hetty {{chose to be}} as angry {{as if it had}} been quite a cruel rebuke. [...] "I hate dancing--there--I own it," [...] she <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> toss of her head.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, mamma. It is all Sir Thomas's {{property}} there; {{and they}} have got a regular kitchen, beautifully built, Her--Mr. Fitzgerald <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> regular cook. I do wish we could have one at Clady." ...|$|E
6000|$|But the child, wiser in {{his innocence}} than many an older counsellor, pointed upward, <b>saying</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> look of perfect trust,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|The answer {{brought a}} {{momentary}} stiffness in its train. John broke the rather awkward silence by <b>saying</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> slight effort: ...|$|R
60|$|Margaret was <b>saying,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> swift blush and {{an effect}} of daring, {{that she had no}} doubt she was a socialist.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Poor nurse,' Amy <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> kind sigh, 'I suppose I {{had better}} {{show her the}} telegram. She is sure to cry. She looks upon mother as a thief who has come to steal baby from her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Pen {{kissed her}} Ladyship's. [...] "I {{have been to}} Tunbridge," [...] he says, [...] "and seen Miss Amory; and find on my arrival that--that a villain has transplanted me in her affections," [...] he <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tragedy air.|$|E
6000|$|DOLPHIN. So I should suppose. (Silence. A {{spasm of}} anguish crosses DOLPHIN'S face; then he reassumes the old Thinker's mask. AMY {{looks at him}} for a little longer, then, unable to {{suppress}} her growing curiosity, she <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sudden burst of childish confidence:) ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{made out}} that the woman was asking him for his name--"Meester--? Meester--?" [...] she kept <b>saying,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> note of interrogation.|$|R
6000|$|His junior clenched it by <b>saying</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> laugh, [...] "I {{should think}} not! Fancy old Fuller's rusty black gown {{up in our}} pulpit!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I <b>say,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{engaging}} {{smile and}} trying to keep up a good social tone. [...] "It's queer, isn't it? We've both forgotten." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You!' she <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{smile that}} {{reminded}} me of lemon sherbet. I was waiting up-stairs in the slosh, then, and I was right down here by the door, putting some vinegar and cayenne into an empty bottle of tabasco, and I heard all they said.|$|E
6000|$|PHILIP (cheerily, {{following}} him). Coming, dad, coming. (On {{the window}} threshold, he stops; looking after Crampton; then turns fantastically with his bat bent into a halo round his head, and <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lowered voice to Mrs. Clandon and Gloria) Did {{you feel the}} pathos of that? (He vanishes.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{see what}} I am come to, Pen," [...] he <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heartbroken voice, trying, with hands {{all of a}} tremble, to tie the hat on the boy's head. He laughs bitterly at the ill success of his endeavours. [...] "Oh, you silly papa!" [...] laughs Tommy, too.|$|E
6000|$|... "You may felicitate yourself, Highness," [...] he {{ventured to}} <b>say,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> grin, to Guidobaldo, [...] "that you have reared your niece in devout ways." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, not often," [...] said Colville. [...] "Because, if you do, you can't <b>say</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> good {{conscience}} afterward {{that you were}} only in fun." ...|$|R
6000|$|Tommy {{handed it}} over <b>with</b> <b>an</b> affectionate look at its smooth handle. Dan {{examined}} it carefully, then putting it into his pocket, walked off, <b>saying</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wink, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Elle ravvole de fous, cher bedid anche!" [...] says Madame Bernstein, {{mimicking}} the Countess's German accent. The Baroness is delighted with her boy's success. [...] "You carry off {{the hearts of}} all the old women, doesn't he, Maria?" [...] she <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sneer at her niece, who quivers under the stab.|$|E
6000|$|Theo {{gives her}} husband a kiss. [...] "My dear, I {{wish they had}} tried," [...] she <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sigh. [...] "I was afraid lest--lest Hetty should have led him, you see; and I think she hath the better head. But, from reading this, {{it appears that the}} new lady has taken command of poor Harry," [...] and she hands me the letter:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Freddy," [...] {{his host}} <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cheerful air of lifelong {{friendship}} and confidence, [...] "you know {{that everybody has}} got two names. Of course your first name is Freddy, and it's a very pretty name. Well, I {{want you to think}} real hard, and then tell me what your other name is, so I can take you back to your mamma." ...|$|E
60|$|The new supply arriving, he {{took the}} cup from his servant's hand; and <b>saying,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> charming affability, 'I am obliged to you, Peak,' {{dismissed}} him.|$|R
60|$|It was {{necessary}} for her mistress to comfort her--which she did, I must <b>say,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> good deal of contrition--before she could be got beyond this.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{his daughters}} heard him <b>say,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> witty allusiveness that was {{difficult}} to follow, [...] "so the Magnet {{has come to the}} Mountain again--eh?" ...|$|R
