5|$|Although {{only the}} United States <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> can {{overturn}} {{the decisions of}} the Oregon <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court,</b> they cannot overturn decisions exclusively based on the Oregon law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn decisions of the Oregon <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court.</b> The U.S. <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> can only accept cases from the Oregon <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> if the decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change the outcome of the case. The Oregon <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> is the final authority on Oregon law, and absent extraordinary circumstances the U.S. <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law (see adequate and independent state ground). Although only the U.S. <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> can reverse or overturn decisions of the Oregon <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court,</b> decisions of the court can be effectively overturned by changing the law. Thus later outcomes of the court can be affected by legislation passed by the Oregon Legislative Assembly or through the initiative and referendum process. Also, in most criminal decisions Oregon’s Governor or the President of the United States may issue a pardon (some crimes require the Oregon Legislature to concur).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to answer what causes dissent in state <b>supreme</b> <b>courts.</b> It also approaches the normative questions of whether dissent in state <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> {{is good or}} bad for democracy. Within I review relevant literature on state <b>supreme</b> <b>courts,</b> judicial voting behavior and dissent. I also conduct my own study of state <b>supreme</b> <b>courts.</b> I find that limited resources affect nonconsensual opinion writing on state <b>supreme</b> <b>courts.</b> I do this by creating an OLS regression model showing that the employment of law clerks causes more nonconsensual opinions and a larger caseload causes less nonconsensual opinion writing. I also find that more dissent is consistent with the democratic tradition, as it enables more voices to be heard...|$|R

5|$|Parker {{clashed with}} the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> {{on a number of}} occasions, with around two-thirds of cases appealed to the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> being upheld. In 1894, Parker gained {{national}} attention in a dispute with the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> over the case of Lafayette Hudson. Hudson was convicted of assault with intent to kill and sentenced to four years imprisonment. He appealed to the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> and was granted bail. Parker refused to release Hudson on the grounds that statute law did not provide the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> the authority to demand Hudson's release.|$|E
5|$|The Oregon <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> (OSC) is {{the highest}} state court in the U.S. state of Oregon.

The OSC holds court at the Oregon <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> Building in Salem, Oregon, near the capitol building on State Street. The building was finished in 1914 and also houses the state's law library, while the courtroom is also used by the Oregon Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|Where society's need is great, {{no other}} {{effective}} means of meeting the need is available, and intrusion on people's privacy is minimal, certain discretionless checkpoints toward that end may briefly detain motorists. In United States v. Martinez-Fuerte (1976), the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> allowed discretionless immigration checkpoints. In Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz (1990), the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> allowed discretionless sobriety checkpoints. In Illinois v. Lidster (2004), the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> allowed focused informational checkpoints. However, in City of Indianapolis v. Edmond (2000), the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> ruled that discretionary checkpoints or general crime-fighting checkpoints are not allowed.|$|E
5000|$|The Joint Senate of the Federal <b>Supreme</b> <b>Courts</b> of Justice (Gemeinsamer Senat der Obersten Gerichtshöfe des Bundes, {{also called}} the Common Senate) is often {{regarded}} as one of the <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> of justice in Germany, but it is rather, as the name suggests, an ad hoc judicial body, that is convened in specific cases only. The Joint Senate consists of the Presidents of the five Federal <b>Supreme</b> <b>Courts</b> (excluding the Bundesverfassungsgericht) and two members of each of the senates involved ("Senate" [...] denotes a judicial 'sub-unit' within a court, usually consisting of three or more judges. All Federal <b>Supreme</b> <b>Courts,</b> as well as subordinate courts of appeal, are divided into several senates). The Joint Senate decides on questions regarding the interpretation of law that are relevant for all five branches of law overseen by the five Federal <b>Supreme</b> <b>Courts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When it judges the {{constitutionality}} of a law or resolves the disputes between <b>Supreme</b> <b>Courts,</b> its composition comprises two more members: two professors of the Law Schools of Greece.

50|$|All told, the Federal Circuit’s {{opinion in}} Ariosa v. Sequenom is a predictable, yet unfortunate, {{application}} of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court’s</b> disastrous reasoning in Mayo. The unintended consequences of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court’s</b> opinion have been further realized in the Federal Circuit’s denial of Sequenom’s innovative claimed method for diagnosing fetal abnormalities.

5|$|A note {{published}} in The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology supported {{the decision on}} procedural grounds, noting that using age in the custody analysis was not a precedent established by the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court.</b> The note argued that establishing such broad legal precedent was outside the bounds of {{the authority of the}} Ninth Circuit and the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> was right to reverse. Instead, the note supported the state court who had applied the law as the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> had in the past.|$|E
5|$|After Boldt's decision, the Washington Department of Fisheries issued new {{regulations}} {{in compliance with}} the decision. The Puget Sound Gillnetters Association and the Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association both filed lawsuits in state court to block the {{new regulations}}. These private concerns won at both the trial court and at the Washington <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court.</b> Washington Attorney General Slade Gorton, representing the state of Washington, supported the position of the private concerns and opposed the position of the United States and the tribes. The United States <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> granted certiorari and vacated the decision of the Washington <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court.</b>|$|E

It ordered a new trial.|$|E
5000|$|Consequently, it is {{the only}} court that can declare an unconstitutional legal {{provision}} [...] "powerless" [...] (not [...] "null and void") and expel it from the Greek legal system, while the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Courts</b> can only declare it as [...] "inapplicable" [...] for the particular case. The decisions of the <b>Supreme</b> Special <b>Court</b> are binding for all <b>courts,</b> including the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Courts.</b>|$|R

5|$|During the Great Depression, three {{important}} United States <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> cases were decided which determined {{the constitutionality of}} New Deal measures, one of which originated in the Eastern District of Missouri.

50|$|The {{judicial}} system of Greece comprises three <b>Supreme</b> Courts: the <b>Court</b> of Cassation (Greece) (Άρειος Πάγος), the Council of State (Συμβούλιο της Επικρατείας) and the Chamber of Accounts (Ελεγκτικό Συνέδριο). These high courts {{are composed of}} professional judges, graduates of the National School of Judges. The way the judges are gradually promoted, until they become members of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Courts,</b> {{is defined by the}} Constitution and the existing laws.

5|$|Galen Clark was {{appointed}} by the commission as the Grant's first guardian, but neither Clark nor the commissioners {{had the authority to}} evict homesteaders (which included Hutchings).
