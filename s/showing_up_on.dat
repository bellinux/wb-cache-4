By 1938, SR85 had been paved as well as the portion between Ajo and Why that would eventually become part of SR85. The portion between Why and the border with Mexico began <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> maps at this time as a gravel road. In 1943, the portion of the highway between Ajo and Why was added to the state highway system, but as SR86, when it was extended west from Tucson to Ajo. In 1955, the highway was extended to Lukeville at the United States-Mexico border with an overlap with SR86 between Ajo and Why when a county road was added to SR85.|$|E

In 1993, she joined the rival World Wrestling Federation (WWF) under the name Alundra Blayze. In the WWF, she feuded with Bull Nakano and Bertha Faye, while holding the WWF Women's Championship three times. Two years after joining the WWF, Miceli {{returned}} to WCW, <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> an episode of Monday Nitro to throw the WWF Women's Championship belt into a trash can; she was blacklisted by the WWF (later WWE) for the next 20 years as a result. In her second WCW run, Miceli feuded with Bull Nakano and Oklahoma, and became the first woman to hold the WCW World Cruiserweight Championship. After training wrestlers such as Torrie Wilson, Stacy Keibler, and Nora Greenwald (Molly Holly) at the WCW Power Plant, she left the company in 2001. On March 28, 2015, she was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, under the Alundra Blayze moniker.|$|E
5|$|Veronica and Tim {{investigate}} Hank’s alibi further, and it checks out, {{leading to}} his release. Veronica and Tim find secret phone recordings kept by Hank. Veronica brings Keith the CD, but he informs her that Hank has disappeared as well. We see Hank <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Mindy’s boat. While {{listening to the}} phone calls, Veronica notices Mindy and Hank talking about a place named “Papa’s cabin”. They investigate the most recent phone calls made by Hank, and find that his alibi was faked—he was helping the witness’s son escape foster care. Keith comes {{up with the idea}} that Papa’s cabin {{has something to do with}} Ernest Hemingway. Keith visits the cabin, a retreat in Central America, before boarding the motorboat. He finds Hank, who says that he was working with her to kill the Dean. He says that he and Mindy had a fight, and Mindy fell overboard. We see Mindy’s body washed up on a beach.|$|E

In addition, ODB's run-ins with the law were well publicized—he was arrested several times for offenses including assault, shoplifting, wearing body armor after being convicted of a felony, and possession of cocaine, and he missed multiple court dates. In late 2000, Ol' Dirty Bastard unexpectedly escaped {{near the end of}} his rehab sentence, spending one month on the run as a fugitive before <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> stage at the record release party for The W in New York City. He managed to escape the club but was later captured by police in Philadelphia and sent to New York to face charges of cocaine possession.

2500|$|In February 2008, it was {{reported}} that the set would transfer to Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, where a new set would be built as the set was looking [...] "shabby", with its flaws <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> high-definition television broadcasts. However, by April 2010 a follow-up report confirmed that Albert Square would remain at Elstree Studios for at least another four years, taking the set through its 25th anniversary. The set was consequently rebuilt for high definition on the same site, using mostly real brick with some areas using a new improved plastic brick. Throughout rebuilding filming would still take place, and so scaffolding was often seen on screen during the process, with some storylines written to accommodate the rebuilding, such as the Queen Vic fire.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to previous Led Zeppelin albums, In Through the Out Door features much greater {{influence on the}} part of bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones and vocalist Robert Plant, and relatively less from drummer John Bonham and guitarist Jimmy Page. Two songs from the album—"South Bound Saurez" [...] and [...] "All My Love"—were the only two original Led Zeppelin songs that Jimmy Page had no part in writing. With the exception of [...] "Darlene," [...] a boogie-woogie based song credited to all band members (which was eventually released on the 1982 album, Coda), Bonham did not receive writing credits for any of the songs recorded at Polar Studios. This diminished input by Page and Bonham is attributed to the two band members often not <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> time at the recording studio, with Bonham struggling with alcoholism and Page battling heroin addiction.

2500|$|Morris {{attended}} the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Morris graduated in 1969 with a B.A. in history. For {{a brief time}} Morris held small jobs, first as a cable television salesman {{and then as a}} term-paper writer. His unorthodox approach to applying for grad school included [...] "trying to get accepted at different graduate schools just by <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> their doorstep." [...] Having unsuccessfully approached both the University of Oxford and Harvard University, Morris was able to talk his way into Princeton University, where he began studying the history of science, a topic in which he had [...] "absolutely no background." [...] His concentration was in the history of physics, and he was bored and unsuccessful in the prerequisite physics classes he had to take. This, together with his antagonistic relationship with his advisor Thomas Kuhn ('You won't even look through my telescope.' And his response was 'Errol, it's not a telescope, it's a kaleidoscope.') ensured that his stay at Princeton would be short.|$|E
2500|$|On December 2, {{the second}} storm made {{landfall}} on the Oregon coast, with the hurricane-force winds that were forecast, along with tropically-affected temperatures. In {{as little as}} two hours, temperatures across the region jumped from near freezing to above 60degrees in areas just as the first bands of the heavy rain were hitting. The storm moved northward through Oregon and Washington with strong rain (including [...] in 24hours in Bremerton, Washington.) accompanying the wind. The rapid rise in temperature caused the recent snow to melt quickly, indicating that record flooding was imminent {{across much of the}} region. Flood warnings across five rivers in Washington were issued late in the afternoon, well before any started to rise (by the 11p.m. nightly newscasts in Seattle, the flood warnings were updated to include every mountain-fed river in the state). The Skokomish River was the first to hit flood stage at 2:45a.m. on December 3, as drenching rains were still pelting the area. Other rivers in the state began to flood their banks at around the same time, and images of widespread flooding began <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the morning newscasts of every Seattle and Portland TV station.|$|E

2500|$|The {{environment}} typically {{depicted in}} most of Theodorescu-Sion's post-1918 creative periods {{is that of the}} mountains, of Argeș and of Motzenland. Vianu proposes that Theodorescu-Sion successfully fabricated himself the mentality of mountain dweller, with broken horizons and human figures seen from up close, with a somber palette that suggests [...] "the coolness and secrecy one finds in a forest canopy." [...] He notes: [...] "one may document the nature of the man who created this painting style with his famous Self-portrait he exhibited , where the protruding anatomy of his face, the unibrow, the one eye open and scanning, evoke in truth the very image of an ancestor from the mountains." [...] Sion's polemic with urban life was becoming explicit. As historian Anca Gogîltan writes, one of his Peisaje ("Landscapes"), dating ca. 1922, has [...] "the delicate figure of a peasant woman <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the edge of a city, dominated by the modern city as a densely packed background, seemingly a screen of geometric shapes." [...] Still lifes such as Roz și roș, she notes, show that he catered to the public's growing interest in folk art items, depicting rustic plates or other works make note of the actual hierarchies of the rural space, showing women thoroughly involved in household chores such as laundering. As noted in 1931 by Broșteanu, there were three deep influences on Sion's still lifes and portraits: the antique ceramic art of Romania, alongside Derain's pictorial vision, and, [...] "unmistakably" [...] so, the post-Impressionist canvasses of Ștefan Luchian.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2016, a {{week before}} his film Julieta was to be {{released}} in Spain, Pedro and Agustín Almodóvar were listed in the leak of the Panama Papers from the database of the offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca; their names <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the incorporation documents of a company based in the British Virgin Islands between 1991 and 1994. As a result, Pedro cancelled scheduled press, interviews and photocalls he had made for the release of Julieta in Spain. Agustín released a statement in which he declared himself fully responsible, saying that he has always taken charge of financial matters while Pedro has been dedicated to the creative side and hoping that this would not tarnish his brother's reputation. He also stressed that the brothers have always abided by Spanish tax laws. [...] "On the legal front there are no worries", he explained. [...] "It's a reputation problem which I'm responsible for. I'm really sorry that Pedro has had to suffer the consequences. I have taken full responsibility for what has happened, not because I'm his brother or business partner, but because the responsibility is all mine. I hope that time will put things in its place. We are not under any tax inspection". The week after the release of Julieta, Pedro gave an interview in which he stated that he knew nothing about the shares as financial matters were handled by his brother, Agustín. However, he emphasised that his ignorance was not an excuse and took full responsibility. Agustín later admitted that he believed Julietas box office earnings in Spain suffered as a result, as the film reportedly had the worst opening of an Almodóvar film at the Spanish box office in 20 years.|$|E
