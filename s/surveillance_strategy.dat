40|$|AbstractWe {{compared}} the cost-effectiveness of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) programme of active surveillance plus decolonization {{with the current}} Veterans Health Administration (VHA) strategy of active surveillance alone, {{as well as a}} common strategy of no surveillance. A decision-analytical model was developed for an inpatient stay time horizon, using the VHA's perspective. Model inputs were taken from published literature where available, and supplemented with expert opinion when necessary. Effectiveness outcomes were hospital-acquired MRSA infections and deaths avoided. One-way and two-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were performed. In the base-case analysis, the strategy of active surveillance plus decolonization dominated (i. e. lower cost and greater effectiveness) both the comparison strategies of active surveillance and no surveillance. In addition, the active <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategy</b> dominated the strategy of no surveillance. One-way and two-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated that at low levels of direct benefit of decolonization (1 – 4 %), the strategy of active surveillance plus decolonization would no longer be dominant. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, active surveillance plus decolonization dominated both the other two strategies, and the active <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategy</b> dominated no surveillance in all of 1000 Monte Carlo simulations. These results provide a strong economic argument for adding an MRSA decolonization protocol to the current VHA active <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategy...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{discovery}} of antibiotics heralded {{the start of}} a ‘Golden Age’ in the history of medicine. Over the years, the use of antibiotics extended beyond medical practice into animal husbandry, aquaculture and agriculture. While the ‘Golden Age’ featured the rapid {{discovery of}} a series of new classes of antibiotics, the current discovery/development pipeline has been less productive. We are now faced with the threat of diseases mediated by pathogenic bacteria that are resistant to all major classes of antibiotic. Evolution of bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics results from the inherent genetic capability that bacteria have to adapt rapidly to changing environmental conditions. Consequently, under antibiotic selection pressures, bacteria have acquired resistance to all classes of antibiotics, sometimes very shortly after their introduction. Multiple drug resistant (MDR) bacteria are found worldwide and are possibly signalling the end of the antibiotic era. Arguably, the evolution and rapid dissemination of MDR genes en-masse across microbial pathogens {{is one of the most}} serious threats to human health. In this context, effective <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategies</b> to track the development of resistance to multiple antibiotics are vital to managing global infection control. These <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategies</b> are necessary for not only human health but also for animal health and plant production. Shortfalls in the present <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategies</b> need to be identified. Raising awareness of the genetic events that promote co-selection of resistance to multiple antimicrobials is an important prerequisite to the design and implementation of molecular <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategies.</b> In this review we will discuss how <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategies</b> are important for our understanding of the possible relationship between the use of low-dose antibiotics in animal husbandry and evolution of MDR in Gram-negative bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Background: Surveillance {{measures}} {{can only be}} effective if {{key players in the}} system accept them. Acceptability, which describes the willingness of persons to contribute, is often analyzed using participatory methods. Participatory epidemiology enables the active involvement of key players in the assessment of epidemiological issues. In the present study, we used a participatory method recently developed by CIRAD (Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement) to evaluate the functionality and acceptability of Classical Swine Fever (CSF) surveillance in wild boar in Germany, which is highly dependent on the participation of hunters. The acceptability of alternative <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategies</b> was also analyzed. By conducting focus group discussions, potential vulnerabilities in the system were detected and feasible alternative <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategies</b> identified. Results: Trust in the current surveillance system is high, whereas the acceptability of the operation of the system is medium. Analysis of the acceptability of alternative <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategies</b> showed how risk-based surveillance approaches can be combined to develop strategies that have sufficient support and functionality. Furthermore, some <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategies</b> were clearly rejected by the hunters. Thus, the implementation of such strategies may be difficult. Conclusions: Participatory methods can be used to evaluate the functionality and acceptability of existing surveillance plans for CSF among hunters and to optimize plans regarding their chances of successful implementation.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of synthesizing a {{controller}} for a robot with a surveillance objective, that is, the robot is required to maintain knowledge of {{the location of a}} moving, possibly adversarial target. We formulate this problem as a one-sided partial-information game in which the winning condition for the agent is specified as a temporal logic formula. The specification formalizes the surveillance requirement given by the user, including additional non-surveillance tasks. In order to synthesize a <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategy</b> that meets the specification, we transform the partial-information game into a perfect-information one, using abstraction to mitigate the exponential blow-up typically incurred by such transformations. This enables the use of off-the-shelf tools for reactive synthesis.

This survey identified sarcoma <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategies</b> for Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) members and rationales behind them. Understanding current practice should facilitate studies to generate evidence-based surveillance protocols. Methods. Permission was granted by the Research and Executive Committee of the MSTS to survey members on <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategies.</b> First, the questionnaire requested demographic and clinical practice information. Second, the survey focused on clinicians’ specific surveillance soft tissue and bone sarcoma protocols. Results. 20 percent of MSTS members completed the survey. The primary rationale for protocols was training continuation, followed by published guidelines, and finally personal interpretation of the literature. 95 % of the respondents believe that additional studies regarding appropriate surveillance protocols are needed. 87 % reported patient concerns regarding radiation exposure from surveillance imaging. For soft tissue and bone sarcoma local recurrence, responders identified surgical margin, histologic grade, and tumor size {{as the most important}} factors. For metastases, important risk factors identified included histologic grade, tumor size, and histologic type. Protocols demonstrated wide variation. Conclusion. This survey demonstrates that <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategies</b> utilized by MSTS members are not evidence-based, providing rationale for multi-institutional studies.

40|$|Effective, {{statistically}} robust {{sampling and}} <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategies</b> form an integral component of large agricultural {{industries such as}} the grains industry. Intensive in-storage sampling is essential for pest detection, Integrated Pest Management (IPM), to determine grain quality and to satisfy importing nation’s biosecurity concerns, while surveillance over broad geographic regions ensures that biosecurity risks can be excluded, monitored, eradicated or contained within an area. In the grains industry, a number of qualitative and quantitative methodologies for surveillance and in-storage sampling have been considered. Primarily, research has focussed on developing statistical methodologies for in storage sampling strategies concentrating on detection of pest insects within a grain bulk, however, the need for effective and statistically defensible <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategies</b> has also been recognised. Interestingly, although surveillance and in storage sampling have typically been considered independently, many techniques and concepts are common between the two fields of research.

40|$|Surveillance for {{invasive}} non-indigenous species (NIS) is {{an integral}} part of a quarantine system. Estimating the efficiency of a <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategy</b> relies on many uncertain parameters estimated by experts, such as the efficiency of its components in face of the specific NIS, the ability of the NIS to inhabit different environments, and so on. Due to the importance of detecting an invasive NIS within a critical period of time, it is crucial that these uncertainties be accounted for in the design of the surveillance system. We formulate a detection model that takes into account, in addition to structured sampling for incursive NIS, incidental detection by untrained workers. We use info-gap theory for satisficing (not minimizing) the probability of detection, while at the same time maximizing the robustness to uncertainty. We demonstrate the trade-off between robustness to uncertainty, and an increase in the required probability of detection.

40|$|Eradication of {{invasive}} fungal pathogens that undergo wind-assisted dispersal {{can be extremely}} difficult. Many fungal pathogens can survive on multiple hosts and wind-assisted dispersal can rapidly spread inoculum over large areas, leading to wide-spread, multiple loci of infection. When eradication attempts are made, a surveillance system is required that can provide an early warning if the attempt has been unsuccessful. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for large-scale surveillance systems that can detect the movement of airborne inoculum, and which can be deployed over a large area. Traditional methods for trapping airborne fungal spores make use of stationary traps, however, traps can also be mounted on remote piloted vehicles, allowing the use of mobile traps, which can provide a far more flexible approach to the sampling of airborne spores. In this paper we compared a range of <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategies</b> based on stationary or mobile traps, and evaluated the ability of these traps to detect airborne spores. Using a computational model, we simulated a number of dispersal events, and the use of various <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategies</b> to detect these events. Results of our simulations showed that strategies based on mobile traps have a much greater probability of detecting airborne spores than strategies based on stationary traps, and that mobile trap strategies required a far lower number of traps to achieve a reasonable probability of detection. <b>Surveillance</b> <b>strategies</b> based on mobile traps can be effectively employed to define the extent of a pathogen outbreak, and also to monitor the reduction in airborne inoculum once eradication attempts have commenced. If deployed over suitably long time periods, continual no-detection results by <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategies</b> based on mobile traps can also provide a high level of confidence that eradication has been successful...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a {{comprehensive}} {{evaluation of the}} currently implemented surveillance system for Classical Swine fever (CSF) in German wild boar was conducted and compared to alternative, risk-based surveillance strategies. Risk-factors for infection of wild boar with the CSF-virus and for detection of wild boar infected with CSF were identified and used to inform and develop alternative surveillance strategies. The currently applied <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategy</b> {{was defined as the}} reference strategy. The study area targeted the federal states of Rhineland-Palatinate (RP) and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (MV). To assess the performance of the surveillance strategies, sensitivity and timeliness of the strategies were examined utilizing a simulation model, parameterized with real data from RP and MV. These included estimates of population size, data regarding population structure, hunting data and the serological course of CSF-infection in wild boar. The sensitivity was determined by measuring the probability of detection of a CSF-infection within one year. Timeliness was defined as the time between introduction and detection of a CSF-infection. The acceptability of the surveillance strategies was examined using methods of participatory epidemiology. Due to the key role of hunters within the surveillance system for CSF in wild boar, the acceptability of the currently used and the alternative surveillance strategies by hunters was analyzed and compared. The cost-effectiveness of the surveillance strategies was investigated {{with the help of the}} simulation model. Age, population density, seasonality and the examination of samples, resulting from passive surveillance were identified as risk-factors. On the basis of these factors, 31 additional surveillance strategies were developed and evaluated against the reference strategy. As it was not possible to investigate all evaluation attributes for each <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategy,</b> the analyses were conducted in different blocks, in which the strategies for the same evaluation attributes were investigated and compared to each other. In three of the four blocks, an age-dependent <b>surveillance</b> <b>strategy</b> showed the best overall result.
