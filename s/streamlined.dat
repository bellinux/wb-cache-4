These methods take full {{account of the}} internal attributes of <b>streamline</b> data, reduce the human factors of qualitative evaluation of reservoir <b>streamline</b> field and determine the direction for remaining oil potential in the high water cut stage. The new <b>streamline</b> field grading method classifies the displacement energy according to the <b>streamline</b> spatial coordinates and the oil and water flow ratio, and clearly indicates the distribution position of the weak drive <b>streamline</b> and the strong drive <b>streamline,</b> making the <b>streamline</b> numerical simulation not only relying on the <b>streamline</b> density to determine the flow intensity qualitatively, but can reach the quantitative evaluation. The Nm 3 - 4 - 1 layer of the Gang Dong oilfield is in the late stage of high water cut development. The distribution of the <b>streamline</b> field is complex. By adjusting the <b>streamline</b> field in time, the flow strength between Lq 7 - 8 and Lq 8 - 8 wells is decreased.

5|$|Just as the {{new design}} was {{approaching}} finalisation, the LMS marketing department created a problem that was close to being insurmountable. The London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) had recently introduced its <b>streamlined</b> Class A4 locomotive which had {{captured the imagination of}} the public, and the marketing department persuaded the board that the LMS's new locomotives should be <b>streamlined</b> too. This was problematic in that the new design was so large that it only just conformed to the maximum loading gauge for the main line; moreover, it was sufficiently heavy that it was close to the Civil Engineer's maximum weight limit. Nevertheless, Coleman managed to design a <b>streamlined</b> steel casing that hugged the locomotive so tightly that it could still meet the loading gauge. The casing weighed some , but Coleman managed to save an equivalent weight in the locomotive itself.|$|E

40|$|Many {{computer}} aided diagnosis (CAD) schemes {{have been}} developed for colon cancer detection using Virtual Colonoscopy (VC). In earlier work, we developed an automatic polyp detection method integrating flow visualization techniques, that forms part of the CAD functionality of an existing Virtual Colonoscopy pipeline. Curvature <b>streamlines</b> were used to characterize polyp surface shape. Features derived from curvature <b>streamlines</b> correlated highly with true polyp detections. During testing with a large number of patient data sets, we found that the correlation between <b>streamline</b> features and true polyps could be affected by noise and our <b>streamline</b> generation technique. The seeding and spacing constraints and CT noise could lead to <b>streamline</b> fragmentation, which reduced the discriminating power of our <b>streamline</b> features. In this paper, we present two major improvements of our curvature <b>streamline</b> generation. First, we adapted our <b>streamline</b> seeding strategy to the local surface properties and made the <b>streamline</b> generation faster. It generates a significantly smaller number of seeds but still results in a comparable and suitable <b>streamline</b> distribution. Second, based on our observation that longer <b>streamlines</b> are better surface shape descriptors, we improved our <b>streamline</b> tracing algorithm to produce longer <b>streamlines.</b> Our improved techniques are more efficient and also guide the <b>streamline</b> geometry to correspond better to colonic surface shape. These two adaptations support a robust and high correlation between our <b>streamline</b> features and true positive detections and lead to better polyp detection results.

In this paper, we show that statistical distributions of measurements along the trajectory of a <b>streamline</b> can be used as a robust and effective descriptor to measure the similarity between <b>streamlines.</b> With the distribution-based approach, we present a framework for interactive exploration of 3 D vector fields with <b>streamline</b> query and clustering. <b>Streamline</b> queries allow us to rapidly identify <b>streamlines</b> that share similar geometric features to the target <b>streamline.</b> <b>Streamline</b> clustering allows us to group together <b>streamlines</b> of similar shapes. Based on user’s selection, different clusters with different features at different levels of detail can be visualized to highlight features in 3 D flow fields.

30|$|Comparison of the {{different}} types of <b>streamline</b> attributes in the 14 clusters is shown in Table  2. In the first types of <b>streamline</b> clusters, the average oil saturation, the flow rate of oil phase fluid, and the oil–water flow ratio are much higher than that of the 14 th type of <b>streamline</b> cluster. The above parameters decrease with the increase of <b>streamline</b> classification. The average water saturation and the flow rate of water phase fluid in different <b>streamline</b> clusters increase with the increase of <b>streamline</b> classification. We can accurately determine the optimal number of <b>streamline</b> clusters using the S_Dbw coefficient. Meanwhile, the <b>streamline</b> field evaluation by the peak density clustering algorithm can well reflect the current development status of the reservoir.|$|R

The Broadway Limited was one of four pre-World War II Pennsylvania trains to receive such equipment; the others being the General (New York–Chicago), Spirit of St. Louis (New York–St. Louis), and Liberty Limited (Washington–Chicago). Other Pennsylvania trains continued to use heavyweight cars until after the end of World War II. Most of the 1938 cars were built new by Pullman-Standard between March and May of that year, but the diners, RPO and baggage cars were rebuilt from heavyweight cars by the railroad's Altoona shops. The Broadway Limited was the only Pennsylvania train to be completely re-equipped with lightweight sleeping cars before World War II. The train's running time was further reduced to 16 hours.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{control of}} <b>streamline</b> density {{is key to}} {{producing}} several effective forms of visualization of 2 -dimensional vector fields. We introduce a technique that uses an energy function to guide the placement of <b>streamlines</b> at a specified density. This energy function uses a low-pass filtered version of the image to measure {{the difference between the}} current image and the desired visual density. We reduce the energy (and thereby improve the placement of <b>streamlines)</b> by (1) changing the positions and lengths of <b>streamlines,</b> (2) joining <b>streamlines</b> that nearly abut, and (3) creating new <b>streamlines</b> to fill sufficiently large gaps. The entire process is iterated to produce <b>streamlines</b> that are neither too crowded nor too sparse. The resulting <b>streamlines</b> manifest a more hand-placed appearance than do regularly- or randomly-placed <b>streamlines.</b> Arrows can be added to the <b>streamlines</b> to disambiguate flow direction, and flow magnitude can be represented by the thickness, density, or intensity of the lines.

Furthermore, we propose solutions to <b>streamline</b> clustering and viewpoint partitioning based on the representativeness of <b>streamlines</b> and viewpoints, respectively. Finally, we define a camera path that passes through all selected viewpoints for automatic flow field exploration. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach by showing experimental results with different flow data sets, and conducting rigorous comparisons between our algorithm and other seed placement or <b>streamline</b> selection algorithms based on information theory.

30|$|<b>Streamline</b> {{numerical}} simulation {{is widely used}} as an important means to characterize fluid flow paths and describe {{the intensity of the}} flow field during the development of an oil field. By establishing the pressure equation on the grid and quadrature of the <b>streamline,</b> we can get the corresponding pressure equipotential surface and establish a natural migration network. The fluid moves along the <b>streamline,</b> so as to track the migration of oil, gas, and water in the reservoir. Compared with the traditional finite difference {{numerical simulation}} method, modern reservoir <b>streamline</b> simulation in many aspects has achieved great breakthroughs, such as the Pollock <b>streamline</b> tracing method (Jackson et al. 1988), data transfer method between the network and grid (Batycky et al. 1997), and the history matching method based on <b>streamline</b> simulation (Wang 2002). Thiele and Batycky (2003) established water injection optimization model by <b>streamline</b> numerical simulation technology. Cheng et al. (2007) established the historical fitting method of <b>streamline</b> field numerical simulation through three-dimensional three-phase reservoir <b>streamline</b> simulation. Zhao et al. (2016) predicted the connectivity between oil and water wells based on the interwell connectivity inversion model. Wang et al. (2017) characterized the water drive flow field through the water drive characteristic curve and the interwell connectivity model. However, the current <b>streamline</b> field simulation can only qualitatively judge the distribution of the current flow field by the <b>streamline</b> density in each area of the reservoir; it cannot quantitatively evaluate the <b>streamline</b> field. Therefore, we need to explore a method for quantitative evaluation of reservoir <b>streamline</b> field.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Most <b>streamline</b> {{generation}} algorithms either {{provide a}} particular density of <b>streamlines</b> across the domain or explicitly detect features, such as critical points, and follow customized rules to emphasize those features. However, the former generally includes many redundant <b>streamlines,</b> {{and the latter}} requires Boolean decisions on which points are features (and may thus suffer from robustness problems for real-world data). We take {{a new approach to}} adaptive <b>streamline</b> placement for steady vector fields in 2 D and 3 D. We define a metric for local similarity among <b>streamlines</b> and use this metric to grow <b>streamlines</b> from a dense set of candidate seed points. The metric considers not only Euclidean distance, but also a simple statistical measure of shape and directional similarity. Without explicit feature detection, our method produces <b>streamlines</b> that naturally accentuate regions of geometric interest. In conjunction with this method, we also propose a quantitative error metric for evaluating a <b>streamline</b> representation based on how well it preserves the information from the original vector field. This error metric reconstructs a vector field from points on the <b>streamline</b> representation and computes a difference of the reconstruction from the original vector field.

The results show that, for the current <b>streamline</b> field of the Nm 3 - 4 - 1 layer in the Gang dong oil field, when the evaluation coefficient we specified is the minimum, the clustering result is the best.

30|$|Like FD {{simulation}}, <b>streamline</b> simulation has its limitations.
