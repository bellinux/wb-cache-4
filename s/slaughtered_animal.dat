500|$|The {{belief that}} witches could cause harm was common among all social groups in early modern Scotland. In 1701 in Anstruther, Elizabeth Dick {{had been turned}} away from the local mill when begging. She cursed the mill and several {{witnesses}} testified that the grain in the mill turned red. Only when {{one of the people who}} had refused her help ran after her and gave her alms did she bless the mill and everything returned to normal. About half of accused witches had already gained a reputation for causing harm over a long period of time. The fact that only four per cent of recorded accused witches were involved in folk healing seems to indicate that healing skills were largely seen as different from witchcraft. The Aberdeenshire trials of 1596 reveal that spells could be purchased from folk magicians for success at fishing, to ensure a happy marriage, to prolong life and to affect the weather, but harmful spells were considered witchcraft. Many accusations included sexual fears. Margaret Bain, a midwife, it was claimed, could transfer the pains of childbirth to a woman's husband and Helen Gray cast a spell on a man that gave him a permanent erection. Witches and other sorts of folk magicians could also carry out divinations. These included by reading the marks on the shoulder blade of a <b>slaughtered</b> <b>animal,</b> measuring a person's sleeve or waist to see if they were suffering from a fever, or being able to find answers based on which way a sieve suspended from scissors or shears swung, as [...] Margaret Mungo was accused of doing before the kirk session of Dingwall in 1649.|$|E

2500|$|While such a use may be {{established}} in later texts, Katja Goebs argued in a 2003 article {{that it is impossible}} for the crime of stealing the temple idol to be punished merely by stripping the offender of his titles. The typical punishment for such sacrilege was death by burning. Rather, Goebs argued that [...] "enemy" [...] also indicates a sacrificial offering, because in Egyptian ritual, the <b>slaughtered</b> <b>animal</b> symbolizes Set, the enemy of the Pharonic god Horus, being slaughtered. Teti therefore would have stolen some of the herd for providing sacrificial animals, a crime more in keeping with what he received.|$|E
2500|$|Professor James Kugel of Bar Ilan University {{reported}} that ancient texts offered several explanations for why {{peoples of the}} ancient Near East sacrificed animals: to provide the deity food (see [...] ); to offer {{the life of the}} <b>slaughtered</b> <b>animal</b> as a substitute for the offerer's; to give a costly possession as a sign of fealty or in the hope of receiving still more generous compensation from the deity. Kugel {{reported that}} more recent explanations saw the sacrifice as establishing a tangible connection between the sacrificer and the deity, while others stress the connection of the sacred with violence or see the function of religion as defusing violence that would otherwise be directed at people. Kugel argued that the Israelites conceived of animal sacrifices as the principal channel of communication between the people and God. Professor William Hallo, formerly of Yale University, described sacrifice as a sacred-making of the human consumption of animal meat that followed.|$|E

It applies to both domesticated and wild animals, and to both {{the right and the left}} hip. But it does not apply to birds, because they have no spoon-shaped hip as the muscles upon the hip bone (femur) of a bird lie flat and are not raised and convex like those of cattle. It also applies to a live fetus found in a <b>slaughtered</b> <b>animal,</b> although Rabbi Judah said that it does not apply to a fetus. And the live fetus' fat is permitted.

2500|$|The {{prohibition}} of stunning {{and the treatment}} of the <b>slaughtered</b> <b>animal</b> expressed in shechita law limits the extent to which Jewish slaughterhouses can industrialize their procedures. The most industrialized attempt at a kosher slaughterhouse, Agriprocessors of Postville, Iowa, became the center of controversy in 2004, after People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals released a gruesome undercover video of cattle struggling to their feet with their tracheas and esophagi ripped out after shechita. Some of the cattle actually got up and stood {{for a minute or so}} after being dumped from the rotating pen. Dr. Temple Grandin, told Mason City, Iowa's Globe Gazette, [...] "I thought it was the most disgusting thing I'd ever seen. I couldn't believe it. I've been in at least 30 other kosher slaughter plants, and I had never ever seen that kind of procedure done before. … I've seen kosher slaughter really done right, so the problem here is not kosher slaughter. The problem here is a plant that is doing everything wrong they can do wrong." [...] While Agriprocessors has been criticized by both secular and Jewish organizations for both its human and animal rights violations, the Jewish Orthodox Union (OU) made note to point out that the kashrut of a product is not contingent upon [...] "the conditions in which it is produced. [...] The OU's condonation of Agriprocessors as a possibly inhumane, yet appropriately glatt kosher company has led to discussion as to whether or not industrialized agriculture has undermined the place of halakha (Jewish law) in shechita as well as whether or not halakha has any place at all in Jewish ritual slaughter.|$|E
2500|$|Ala (meaning 'earth' and 'land' in Igbo, also Ájá-ànà) is the {{feminine}} earth spirit {{who is responsible}} for morality, fertility and the dead ancestors who are stored in the underworld in her womb. Ala is {{at the head of the}} Igbo pantheon, maintaining order and carrying out justice against wrongdoers. Ala is the most prominent and worshipped alusi, almost every Igbo village has a shrine dedicated to her called íhú Ala where major decisions are taken. Ala is believed to be involved in all aspects of human affairs including festivals and at offerings. Ala stands for fertility and things that generate life including water, stone and vegetation, colour (àgwà), beauty (mmá) which is connected to goodness in Igbo society, and uniqueness (áfà). She's a symbol of morality who sanctioned omenala Igbo customs from which these moral and ethical behaviours are upheld in Igbo society. Ala is the ground itself, and for this reason taboos and crimes are known as ńsọ́ Ala ('desecration of Ala'), all land is holy as the embodiment of Ala making her the principal legal sanctioning authority. [...] Prohibitions include murder, suicide, theft, incest, and abnormalities of birth such as in many places the birth of twins and the killing and eating of pregnant animals, if a <b>slaughtered</b> <b>animal</b> is found to be pregnant sacrifices are made to Ala and the foetus is buried. People who commit suicides are not buried in the ground or given burial rites but cast away in order not to further offend and pollute the land, their ability to become ancestors is therefore nullified. When an individual dies a 'bad death' in the society, such as from the effects of divine retributive justice or breaking a taboo, they are not buried in the earth, but are discarded in a forest so as not to offend Ala. As in cases of most alusi, Ala has the ability to be malevolent if perceived to be offended and can cause harm against those who offend her.|$|E
60|$|Apart {{from the}} {{apparent}} injustice of vicarious atonement, {{the student is}} well aware that the whole of this sanguinary metaphor is drawn really from the Pagan rites of Mithra, where the neophyte was actually placed under a bull at the ceremony of the TAUROBOLIUM, and was drenched, through a grating, {{with the blood of}} the <b>slaughtered</b> <b>animal.</b> Such reminiscences of the more brutal side of Paganism are not helpful to the thoughtful and sensitive modern mind. But what is always fresh and always useful and always beautiful, is the memory of the sweet Spirit who wandered on the hillsides of Galilee; who gathered the children around him; who met his friends in innocent good-fellowship; who shrank from forms and ceremonies, craving always for the inner meaning; who forgave the sinner; who championed the poor, and who in every decision threw his weight upon the side of charity and breadth of view. When to this character you add those wondrous psychic powers already analysed, you do, indeed, find a supreme character in the world's history who obviously stands nearer to the Highest than any other. When one compares the general effect of His teaching with that of the more rigid churches, one marvels how in their dogmatism, their insistence upon forms, their exclusiveness, their pomp and their intolerance, they could have got so far away from the example of their Master, so that as one looks upon Him and them, one feels that there is absolute deep antagonism and that one cannot speak of the Church and Christ, but only of the Church or Christ.|$|E
