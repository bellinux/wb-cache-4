The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as low-pass filters or median filters.

By first analysing the image data {{in terms of the}} local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sensor</b> pattern <b>noise</b> {{has been}} broadly {{used in the}} {{literature}} for image authentication and source camera identification. The abundant information that a <b>sensor</b> pattern <b>noise</b> carries {{in terms of the}} frequency content makes it unique and hence suitable for source camera identification. The traditional approach for estimating the <b>sensor</b> pattern <b>noise</b> uses a set of images to estimate a pattern residual signal from each image. The estimated residual signals are then averaged to obtain the <b>sensor</b> pattern <b>noise.</b> This {{is based on the assumption}} that each residual signal is a noisy observation of the <b>sensor</b> pattern <b>noise.</b> Such an assumption is well justified in practice because the images are acquired under different conditions making the corresponding residual signals distinct from each other. For instance bright images provide better <b>sensor</b> pattern <b>noise</b> estimation than dark images. Also, saturated pixels cause undesirable noise in residual signals. Inspired by this observation, a weighted averaging approach is proposed for efficient <b>sensor</b> pattern <b>noise</b> estimation. The proposed approach has been validated with two <b>sensor</b> pattern <b>noise</b> estimation techniques from the literature and significant improvements have been shown through experimental results...|$|R

The strategy of combining modal decomposition and frequency-shaped sliding surface control is applied based on the measurement scheme of relative displacement and payload absolute acceleration. Modal decomposition decouples the six modes and calculates the equivalent <b>sensor</b> <b>noises</b> for each mode. The designed performances, transmissibility and sensitivities to the two <b>sensor</b> <b>noises,</b> depend solely on the sliding surface design. The sliding surface is optimized for each mode with predefined constraints which are derived from common industrial requirements. The regulator is designed to realize the designed transmissibility for each mode and to achieve low compliance. The numerical example of the sliding surface optimization gives better result than the manual design. This strategy designs the four performances step by step and iterative design is not necessary...|$|R
40|$|The {{distributed}} fusion {{state estimation}} problem is addressed for sensor network systems with random state transition matrix and random measurement matrices, which provide a unified framework to consider some network-induced random phenomena. The process noise {{and all the}} <b>sensor</b> measurement <b>noises</b> {{are assumed to be}} one-step autocorrelated and different <b>sensor</b> <b>noises</b> are one-step cross-correlated; also, the process <b>noise</b> and each <b>sensor</b> measurement <b>noise</b> are two-step cross-correlated. These correlation assumptions cover many practical situations, where the classical independence hypothesis is not realistic. Using an innovation methodology, local least-squares linear filtering estimators are recursively obtained at each sensor. The distributed fusion method is then used to form the optimal matrix-weighted sum of these local filters according to the mean squared error criterion. A numerical simulation example shows the accuracy of the proposed distributed fusion filtering algorithm and illustrates some of the network-induced stochastic uncertainties that can be dealt with in the current system model, such as sensor gain degradation, missing measurements, and multiplicative noise...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{depth of}} transient electromagnetic {{sensors can be}} effectively increased by reducing the system noise, which is mainly composed of <b>sensor</b> internal <b>noise,</b> electromagnetic interference (EMI), and environmental noise, etc. A high-sensitivity airborne transient electromagnetic (AEM) sensor with low <b>sensor</b> internal <b>noise</b> and good shielding effectiveness is of great importance for deep penetration. In this article, the design and optimization of such an AEM sensor is described in detail. To reduce <b>sensor</b> internal <b>noise,</b> a noise model with both a damping resistor and a preamplifier is established and analyzed. The results indicate that a sensor with a large diameter, low resonant frequency, and low sampling rate will have lower <b>sensor</b> internal <b>noise.</b> To improve the electromagnetic compatibility of the sensor, an electromagnetic shielding model for a central-tapped coil is established and discussed in detail. Previous {{studies have shown that}} unclosed shields with multiple layers and center grounding can effectively suppress EMI and eddy currents. According to these studies, an improved differential AEM sensor is constructed with a diameter, resultant effective area, resonant frequency, and normalized equivalent input noise of 1. 1 m, 114 m 2, 35. 6 kHz, and 13. 3 nV/m 2, respectively. The accuracy of the noise model and the shielding effectiveness of the sensor have been verified experimentally. The results show a good agreement between calculated and measured results for the <b>sensor</b> internal <b>noise.</b> Additionally, over 20 dB shielding effectiveness is achieved in a complex electromagnetic environment.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Sensor</b> pattern <b>noises</b> (SPNs), {{extracted}} from digital images {{to serve as}} the fingerprints of imaging devices, have been proved as an effective way for digital device identification. However, as we demonstrate in this work, the limitation of the current method of extracting the <b>sensor</b> pattern <b>noise</b> is that the SPNs {{extracted from}} images can be severely contaminated by the details from scenes, and as a result, the identification rate is unsatisfactory unless images of a large size are used. In this work, we propose a novel approach for attenuating the influence of the details from scenes on <b>sensor</b> pattern <b>noises</b> so as to improve the device identification rate of the identifier. The hypothesis underlying our SPN enhancement method is that the stronger a signal component in a SPN is, the less trustworthy the component should be, and thus should be attenuated. This hypothesis suggests that an enhanced SPN can be obtained by assigning weighting factors inversely proportional to the magnitude of the SPN components.

40|$|While many methods [9 - 12] {{require that}} {{specific}} assumptions be satisfied, methods based on <b>sensor</b> pattern <b>noise</b> have drawn much attention {{due to the}} relaxation of the similar assumptions. The deterministic component of <b>sensor</b> pattern <b>noise</b> (SPN) is mainly caused by imperfections during the sensor manufacturing process and different sensitivity of pixels to light due to the inhomogeneity of silicon wafers [20]. It {{is because of the}} inconsistency and the uniqueness of manufacturing imperfections and the variable sensitivity of each pixel to light that even sensors made from the same silicon wafer would possess uncorrelated pattern noise, which can be extracted from the images produced by the devices.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{low-cost}} and high-quality digital imaging devices {{and the availability of}} user-friendly and powerful image-editing software, digital images can be easily manipulated without leaving obvious traces. The credibility of digital images is often challenged when they are presented as crucial evidence for news photography, scientific discovery, law enforcement, etc. In this context, digital image forensics emerges as an essential approach for ensuring the credibility of digital images. <b>Sensor</b> pattern <b>noise</b> mainly consists of the photo response non-uniformity noise arising primarily from the manufacturing imperfections and the inhomogeneity of silicon wafers during the manufacturing process. It has been proven to be an effective and robust device fingerprint {{that can be used for}} a variety of important digital image forensic tasks, such as source device identification, device linking, and image forgery detection. The objective of this thesis is to design effective and robust algorithms for better fulfilling the forensic tasks based on <b>sensor</b> pattern <b>noise.</b> We found that the non-unique periodic artifacts, typically shared amongst cameras subjected to the same or similar in-camera processing procedures, often give rise to false positives. These periodic artifacts manifest themselves as salient peaks in the magnitude spectrum of reference <b>sensor</b> pattern <b>noise.</b> We propose a spectrum equalization algorithm to detect and suppress the salient peaks in the magnitude spectrum of reference <b>sensor</b> pattern <b>noise,</b> aiming to improve the accuracy and reliability of source camera identification based on <b>sensor</b> pattern <b>noise.</b> We also propose a framework for large-scale image clustering based on device fingerprints (<b>sensor</b> pattern <b>noises).</b> The proposed clustering framework deals with large-scale and high-dimensional device fingerprint databases and is capable of overcoming the NC >> SC problem, i. e., the number of cameras is much higher than the average number of images acquired by each camera.

The proposed algorithms are evaluated on either a public benchmarking database or our own image databases.
