5000|$|<b>Strawberry</b> foliar <b>nematodes</b> are {{difficult}} to manage due to their robust life cycle. While dormant, they are quite difficult to kill, and they remain viable in dry debris {{for more than one}} year. Adult nematodes can survive desiccation and lie dormant for several years. Eggs can stay dormant until survival conditions are optimal for growth. Once eggs or nematodes are present in the soil, they are nearly impossible to eradicate because they can move laterally in the soil to escape non-optimal conditions. They are found in most foliar tissue, including the leaves, stems, buds, and crowns, making it difficult to control the disease on the plant itself once it has been infected [...]|$|R
40|$|Field microplot, small plot, and {{greenhouse}} {{experiments were}} conducted {{to determine the effects}} of rotation crops on Pratylenchus penetrans, Meloidogyne hapla, and Rhizoctonia fragariae populations. Extraction of P. penetrans from roots and soil in microplots and field plots planted to rotation crops was highest for Garry oat, lowest for Triple S sorgho-sudangrass and Saia oat, and intermediate for strawberry, buckwheat, and canola. Isolation of R. fragariae from bait roots was highest for strawberry and canola after 2 years of rotation and lowest for Saia oat. Nematode extraction from roots of rotation crops in field soils was generally higher than from roots in microplots. Grasses were nonhosts of M. hapla. Strawberry, canola, and buckwheat supported root-knot populations over time, but there were no differences in nematode numbers regardless of crop after one season of strawberry growth. Garry oat, canola, and, to a lesser extent, buckwheat supported large populations of P. penetrans without visible root symptoms. Strawberry plants supported fewer nematodes due to root damage. Nematode numbers from soil were less than from roots for all crops. While there were similar trends for pathogen recovery after more than 1 year of strawberry growth following rotation, differences in pathogen density and fruit yield were not significant. In the greenhouse, P. penetrans populations in roots and soil in pots were much higher for Garry oat than for Saia oat. Total P. penetrans adult and juvenile numbers per pot ranged from 40 to 880 (mean = 365. 6) for Garry oat and 0 to 40 (mean = 8. 7) for Saia oat. Production of Saia oat as a rotation crop may be a means of managing <b>strawberry</b> <b>nematodes</b> and black root rot in Connecticut...|$|R

50|$|<b>Strawberry</b> foliar <b>nematode</b> is {{a disease}} common in {{strawberries}} and ornamental plants that can greatly affect plant yield and appearance, resulting {{in a loss of}} millions of dollars of revenue. Symptoms used to diagnose the disease are angular, water soaked lesions and necrotic blotches. Aphelenchoides fragariae is the nematode pathogen that causes the disease. Its biological cycle includes four life stages, three of which are juvenile. The nematode can undergo multiple life cycles in one growing season when favorable conditions are present. They can infect the crowns, runners, foliage, and new buds of the plant via stylet penetration or through the stomata. The best management practices for this disease are sanitation, prevention of induction of the pathogen to the environment, and planting clean seed or starter plants.|$|R
5000|$|Many plant {{diseases}} are managed chemically, {{but due to}} a ban of nematicides there are currently no nematicides available for any type of foliar nematode. Some insecticides, pesticides, and plant product extracts from plants such as Ficus and Coffee (of which many pesticides and nematicides are neem-based [...] ) {{can be used to}} reduce the numbers of <b>strawberry</b> foliar <b>nematode</b> (a reduction of 67-85%), but none of these chemicals can completely eradicate the nematodes once they are present in the soil. These chemicals affect all stages of the life cycle because they target the nervous system. One chemical, ZeroTol, a broad-spectrum fungicide and algaecide, was shown be to 100% potent against nematodes living in a water suspension, but the study does not show how nematodes are affected in soil or outside of a laboratory environment.|$|R
50|$|This {{organism}} is a 'C' rated pest in the U.S. {{state of}} California, {{meaning that it}} is not subject to state enforcement outside of nurseries except to retard spread or to provide for pest cleanliness in nurseries. For a sense of how that relates to other plant pests, an 'A' rated pest is an organism of known economic importance subject to action enforced by the state (or County Agricultural Commissioner acting as a state agent) involving: eradication, quarantine regulation, containment, rejection, or other holding action such as Aphelenchoides besseyi (<b>strawberry</b> summer dwarf <b>nematode).</b>|$|R
40|$|Tagetes patula is {{well known}} {{to be able to}} {{diminish}} Pratylenchus penetrans (Cobb) populations. In a field experiment, the increase of the P. penetrans soil population density after growing T. patula was significantly less than after chemical soil fumigation with metam sodium. The effect of T. patula on P. penetrans population densities lasted longer than the effect of chemical soil fumigation. Strawberries were grown for 3 consecutive years after T. patula without damage by the root lesion nematode. Assuming a linear rate of increase of the P. penetrans population density, we predict that strawberries could be grown for about 7 successive years without economic damage due to the root lesion <b>nematode.</b> <b>Strawberry</b> yield was greater from the crop grown 3 years after T. patula than that after soil fumigation 4 years previously. About 2 t strawberry yield increase is necessary to allow the growth of Tagetes every 5 th year, without economic loss. The possibility of growing both strawberries and Tagetes in the same year should be investigated...|$|R
30|$|Generally, lesion {{nematodes}} {{are difficult}} to control and therefore various management measures {{should be used in}} integrated pest management (IPM) approach. This approach will be addressed below in the paper for various PPN genera. Specifically, rotating pearl millet with susceptible crops such as strawberry has been used successfully in Egypt (pers. comm., Hosam Elmiligee, All Green Co., El-Behera, Egypt) against PPNs and in Michigan, USA (Warner 2018) to reduce population densities of P. penetrans. A basic control strategy is to use nursery stock free from PPNs especially RKNs and lesion <b>nematodes.</b> Assuming most <b>strawberry</b> sites are infested with R. fragariae, decline of a new planting will be faster if the new plants are infested with <b>nematodes.</b> <b>Strawberry</b> varieties differ in their susceptibilities to R. fragariae; e.g., Jewel is tolerant to R. fragariae. So, it is wise to exploit the degree of host suitability in the nematode control programs. Also, soil fumigation can effectively control black root rot. In addition, weed control is imperative to alleviate nematode damage (Warner 2018). Limitations in expanding nematode control efforts are further aggravated by the lack of awareness of efficient implementation methods by resource-poor Egyptian farmers as well as their limited knowledge of plant clinics where farmers can obtain diagnosis and plant health advice. In USA, LaMondia and Cowles (2005 b) concluded that lesion nematode impact on the strawberry crop was likely much larger than perceived by growers.|$|R
30|$|However, many {{strawberry}} {{varieties are}} quite susceptible to {{many types of}} pathogens, parasites, and pests (e.g., Kuhar and Pfeiffer 2000; El-Shemy et al. 2013; Essa 2015; Joseph et al. 2017). Plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs) rank high among them in Egypt (Abdet-Sattar et al. 2008; El-Habashy 2010) and elsewhere (e.g., Samaliev and Mohamedova 2011; Noling 2016). Abd-Elgawad (2014) estimated annual yield losses of strawberry due to damage by plant-parasitic nematodes in Egypt as 12 %. This accounted for actual annual yield loss of 33, 040.5 metric tons in 2012. Also, soil-borne pathogens were generally documented to interact with nematodes aggravating the yield losses (e.g., LaMondia 1999; LaMondia and Cowles 2005 a). Results of the survey study in the three main Egyptian governorates for growing strawberry i.e., El-Beheira, El-Ismailia, and El-Qaluobia, revealed the presence of 10 genera of PPNs in strawberry soil and root samples (El-Habashy 2010). The root-knot nematodes (RKNs) Meloidogyne spp. were the most prevalent. The nematode genera Aphelenchus, Hoplolaimus, Ditylenchus, and Tylenchus showed 6.69, 9.38, 16.53, and 26.32 % frequency of occurrence (FO), respectively. While, FO for the genera Tylenchorhynchus, Trichodorus, Pratylenchus, Aphelenchoides, and Xiphinema were 3.59, 4.45, 4.46, 5.35, and 2.22 %, respectively. Also, based on field observations, species of Meloidogyne, Pratylenchus, and Aphelenchoides are currently the most economically important and prevalent PPN pests in Egyptian strawberry fields. Moreover, {{in the context of}} strawberry seedling importation from foreign countries, invasive nematodes such as Trichodorus species (stubby-root nematodes) have been detected in limited <b>strawberry</b> farms. Therefore, <b>nematode</b> quarantine programs and continuous reassessment of PPN fauna in Egypt should be upgraded. In this concern, Salama and Abd-Elgawad (2003) discussed such quarantine problems for PPNs and presented an analytical approach to address them.|$|R
