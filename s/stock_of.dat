5|$|By mid-September 2015, {{the global}} <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> highway legal plug-in {{electric}} passenger cars and utility vans reached the one million sales milestone. Sales of plug-in electric vehicles achieved the one million milestone {{almost twice as}} fast as hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). While it took four years and 10 months to reach one-million PEV sales, it took more than around nine years and a few months for HEVs to reach its first million sales. The global ratio between all-electrics (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) has consistently been 60:40 between 2014 and the first half of 2016, mainly due to the large all-electric market in China. In the U.S. and Europe, the ratio is approaching a 50:50 split. All-electric cars have oversold plug-in hybrids, with pure electrics representing about 61% of the global <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> over 2million plug-ins on the world's roads by the end of 2016, up from 58.9% at the end of 2015.

40|$|In Australian markets, authors seek {{to clarify}} the {{relationship}} <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> return performances with their beta, firm market capitalization and trading activity. This study leads us {{to consider the possibility}} that asset pricing studies can be dominated by the <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> the very small companies to the extent of having little relevance to institutional share management. For example, the paper observes how the pattern <b>of</b> returns for <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> the very small firms leads to generalizations that are reversed in respect to the <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> larger firms. Additionally, the study reveals how outcomes may be compromised by "reversals of causality" in the data, so that, for example, beta estimates may be the outcome, rather than the explanation <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> price performances. Overall, the paper finds that when the <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> the very small firms are removed, stock returns have a positive relationship with firm capitalization, while bearing no pronounced relation to either <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> beta or trading activity...|$|R

The input flows in unemployment registered a constant evolution, but the outputflows from unemployment have fell in all counties, this evolutions being the source <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> unemployed persons. In 2008, a number of 31 counties have <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> unemployed, ranging between 9, 900 persons and 80 persons; in 2009, all the counties registered <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> unemployed. The largest stocks (more than 10, 000 persons) were specific for some counties situated in south, south-east and centre. The majority of counties registers some multi-annual averages values <b>of</b> the <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> unemployed ranging between 2, 500 – 1, 000 persons, the largest being in Prahova, Suceava, Galaţi, Argeş, Dolj.

The emissions from all sources of GHGs contribute to the overall <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> GHGs in the atmosphere. In the cap-and-trade variant of {{emissions trading}}, a limit on access to a resource (the cap) is defined and then allocated among users {{in the form of}} permits.

The environmental integrity of emissions trading is depends on the setting of the cap, not the decision to allow trading.|$|E
