5|$|Kakashi's {{background}} is explored in Kakashi Gaiden, a six chapter series that divides {{the gap between}} Part I and II of the manga. Following his father's suicide, Sakumo Hatake aka the White Fang, Kakashi adopted the philosophy {{that the success of}} a mission must always come first rather than comrades in contrast to his father. Kakashi is assigned by his teacher, Minato Namikaze, to lead a mission that would turn the current war in Konoha's favor. When his teammate, Rin Nohara, is captured by enemy ninja, his other teammate, Obito Uchiha, convinces him to rescue her despite the mission's ending. After finding Rin, an enemy-induced cave-in crushed Obito's right half. With his dying wish and the possibility of enemy reinforcements, Obito has Rin implant his newly acquired Sharingan into Kakashi's recently damaged eye socket as a parting gift. His new eye in place, Kakashi flees with Rin as the cave collapsed, eventually completing their mission. Shortly after this event, Kakashi has to rescue Rin again who is kidnapped by Kirigakure; however, he learns that the Kiri, under the influence of Madara Uchiha, has made Rin as the host of the Three Tails, Isobu. Rin requests Kakashi to kill her so <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> used by the Hidden Mist ninja as part of a Trojan Horse scheme against Konoha, but Kakashi is reluctant. She eventually forces herself on the way of Kakashi's Lightning Blade that he originally directed at the pursuing Hidden Mist ninja, killing her. An anime exclusive flashback arc in Naruto Shippuden covered Kakashi coping with what he endured during the war as he becomes an ANBU operative during Minato's time as Hokage and influences Yamato into becoming a member of the ANBU as well. Once relieved of duty in the ANBU, Kakashi becomes a Genin instructor prior to the events of Part I.|$|E

Ikeda's first film with the Director's Company was the 1984 Mermaid Legend which is {{considered by many to be}} his finest work and which garnered a Best Director award for Ikeda at the 1985 Yokohama Film Festival. A year later, Ikeda made Scent of a Spell, also for the Director's Company, a mystery about a newspaperman who saves a girl from suicide but discovers that <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> as innocent as she seems.

25|$|At most {{international}} events, {{each country}} may send {{one to a}} maximum of three entries per discipline. Consequently, even if a skater has a high season's best, he or <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> sent to major events if their country has many good skaters in their discipline. Some skaters have tried to circumvent this by switching to another country. In response, the ISU introduced rules barring skaters from international events for a certain period of time. In the 2010 regulations, it was 24 months or more from the date of the last ISU Championship. In the 2012 regulations, the minimum was 18 months for singles and 12 months for pairs/ice dancers from the date of their last ISU Championships (Worlds, Europeans, Four Continents, Junior Worlds) and 12 months if they competed in some other international competition. Competitors may sit out for much longer because they also have to obtain a release from their previous federation. The ISU has set no limit to how long a country may hold skaters.|$|E

Lulu is able to convince her cousin Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright) to postpone her marriage to Jasper Jacks (Ingo Rademacher), allowing her parents to use the supplies already in place. On November 16, 2006, Luke and Laura remarry on their 25th wedding anniversary. A drunken Tracy has {{to be removed from}} the ceremony, and scheming Maxie manages to sneak into the ceremony and catch Laura's bouquet, much like Scott had 25 years before. On November 20, Luke reveals that Laura's illness is no longer mental but physical and she will soon revert to her catatonic state. Laura decides she wants an early Christmas as <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> around for the real one, and is able to comfort Lulu when she reveals the truth about her abortion. When Luke arrives with the tree, Laura is confused, confirming that her catatonia is returning. After being escorted back to the asylum, Laura reveals to her daughter that she doesn't think she really killed Rick Webber and asks her to prove her innocence. After saying goodbye to her family, Laura returns to her chair and sits with Luke as he tearfully watches her slip back into silence.|$|E

500|$|Many {{of these}} films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing {{to do at the}} time. Baker became a {{favorite}} of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned Paranoia, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of Paranoia, Roger Ebert said: [...] "Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (for some, it is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. <b>She</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> an actress, but she can act. In The Carpetbaggers, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in Paranoia. I think maybe she was saying the hell with it and having a good time." [...] As with Paranoia, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: [...] "I think I made more films [...] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. What they think is wonderful is not what we might... it was marvelous for me because it really brought me back to life, and it gave me a whole new outlook. It's wonderful to know about a different world." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{third and}} final album was again helmed by David Kahne, which Allmusic writer Stewart Mason speculated was a [...] "reaction against the more {{commercial}} sound of Benefactor. By this time, Carter {{had been replaced by}} veteran session drummer Aaron Smith. Instincts was released in October 1984, debuted at No.68 on the Billboard 200, and proved to be the band's best-selling album. It also launched their most successful single, [...] "A Girl in Trouble (Is a Temporary Thing)," [...] which broke the Billboard Top 40 and peaked at No.35. Critical reactions were positive. Despite being the band's most successful effort to date, Columbia pulled the band's promotional support while on a nationwide tour. [...] "The very next town we got to after they made that decision, there wasn't an A person there," [...] said Iyall. [...] " [...] was no local person there, there were no interviews and in-stores arranged as they had been. All that just ground to a halt." [...] Iyall also revealed during that tour that she had signed with her own manager, David Rubinson, and would be leaving the band {{at the end of the}} tour. The band stayed together for a European tour at the beginning of 1985 and upon returning to San Francisco, Iyall quit the band to pursue a solo career. Constant touring has been cited by Iyall as the primary reason for the break-up. [...] "You get tired of each other, and you get intolerant of being uncomfortable and away from your family and your friends." [...] According to a VH1 reunion episode, the issue of Iyall's weight was the reason for the label dropping them. In 2003, Iyall agreed with this claim: [...] "Howie sold us from 415 to Columbia Records, and they were like 'Who's this fat chick?' They decided that was as far as it was going to get, and pulled their support." [...] Crawdaddy! writer Denise Sullivan stated that the label spoke to Iyall about losing weight, but she subsequently refused. In 2010, Iyall declined to discuss the issue, but added that <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> taking full responsibility in the matter.|$|E
500|$|Ayane {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a top-tier character {{in many of the}} games she is playable in, especially in the DOA fighting games where she was noted for being very unpredictable and confusing for the opponent as well as fast and hard to counter. Previewing the original Dead or Alive for the PlayStation, Computer & Video Games opined she [...] "has an unusual floaty kind of fighting style, but has some great moves. Her quick punches make stringing combos together easy, and her throws are great for hitting people into the Danger Zone" [...] (an interactive feature within some arenas). In Prima Games' official guide for Dead or Alive Ultimate (a remake version of Dead or Alive and Dead or Alive 2), Eric Mylonas declared Ayane the [...] "tougher of the two siblings" [...] as she [...] "brings strings of blindingly fast combos into play and has devastating holds and throws." [...] Mylonas wrote Ayane has a major weakness in that she can not stop moving without becoming [...] "an easy prey," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> favored by those who prefer [...] "huge, over-the-top moves," [...] but for a [...] "more patient sort, there's probably no better character in the game." [...] According to GameSpy's guide to Ultimate by Andrew Alfonso, Ayane's key moves include her high kick—which is [...] "a lot" [...] better than Kasumi's—with another move so powerful [...] "it's almost unfair to use it." [...] He also noted how she can be actually more effective with her back turned towards her opponent, {{despite the fact that the}} characters cannot block when facing away from an enemy. In his guide to Dead or Alive 3, Alfonso wrote Ayane is a very unpredictable and quick attacker, even more than in the previous games in the series, and should be played primarily for her backwards position, hers being the best such stance of all the characters in the game. Ayane's speed and deceiving attacks make her a [...] "pretty good" [...] partner for slower fighters for tag team battles, but her primary partners are other ninja characters.|$|E

[...] Those who do this are to be denied the communion of the church". [...] Other canons imposed [...] "the rigorous form of fasting" [...] every Saturday (Canon 26), forbade the baptism of chariot racers or stage performers (Canon 62), and many tightly control the reception of former pagan priests into the Christian church and clergy (Canons, 2,3,4,55).|$|E
2500|$|For {{a divorce}} to be {{effective}} under Jewish law, a man must grant his wife a Jewish divorce—a get—of his own free will. [...] Sometimes a Jewish woman can be held in a so-called [...] "limping marriage" [...] when her husband refuses co-operation in the religious form of divorce. She may have received a civil divorce but cannot remarry within her religion, meaning that {{for all intents and}} purposes, <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to remarry at all—a phenomenon known as agunah. Where one party has the power to grant or withhold a religious divorce, that power {{can be used as a}} bargaining tool to pressure the other party to agree more favourable divorce terms. A parallel problem—sometimes called [...] "male agunah"—can arise when the wife refuses to respond to the husband's attempts to initiate the get process, such as refusing to appear before a rabbinical tribunal for the proceeding. Although the consequences are not as serious for the man, the result can still be a form of extortion to agree to agree to the other party's demands.|$|E
2500|$|Third, {{union members}} {{have a right}} to be {{represented}} by union officials in any disciplinary or grievance meeting under Employment Relations Act 1999 sections 10-15. This can be particularly important when a worker is in trouble with management. Fourth, an employer must permit officials of independent trade unions, which it recognises for collective bargaining, to a reasonable amount of time off to fulfill their role. Also, union members {{have a right to}} a reasonable amount of time off during work hours also to participate in meetings about agreements with the employer, or voting for elections. An ACAS Code of Practice sets out the general guidelines. A final [...] "right" [...] of a worker is that under TULRCA 1992 he or <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> compelled to become a union member in what used to be called closed shop arrangements. Collective agreements had required that employers did not hire anyone who was not a union member. However, the European Court of Human Rights decided in 1981 that [...] "freedom of association" [...] under article 11 also entailed [...] "freedom from association". This shift in the law coincided with the start of a Europe-wide trend toward falling union membership, as the closed shop had been the main mechanism to keep up union support, and thus collective bargaining for fairer workplaces. The ECHR does not, however, prevent unions pursuing fair share agreements, where non-union members contribute to union fees for the services they get for collective bargaining. Nor does it prevent collective agreements that would automatically enroll staff in the trade union, as happens under the Pensions Act 2008, with the right for the worker to opt-out if they chose.|$|E

Discussing the situation, Titus wants Lexa to destroy the thirteenth clan while Clarke thinks they just need time to take out Pike from the inside. Speaking to everyone, Lexa orders the armies not to attack, but instead make a perimeter around Arkadia and says that any Sky Person found past the five mile buffer will be killed. Semet is angry at this and attempts to kill Lexa, but is stopped by Titus who kills him. Later, Titus is against Clarke staying, believing she further endangers Lexa's life. He warns Lexa that, just like with Costia, <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to separate feelings from duty. Lexa is enraged at this, reminding him that because she let Ice Nation into her coalition even after they cut off Costia's head {{and sent it to}} her bed, she is more than capable of separating feelings from duty. Later, Clarke goes into Lexa's room and realizes she is saying goodbye. Clarke says the reason she is going back is because the Sky People are her people. Lexa says that this devotion is what makes Clarke the person she is. Clarke suggests that maybe someday they will owe nothing more to their people, and Lexa responds with [...] "May we meet again." [...] Clarke kisses her and they have sex. Afterward, Clarke admires Lexa's tattoos, pointing out there are only seven circles on her back despite there being nine participants. Lexa tells her she got the one on her back on her Ascension Day, and asks to talk about something else. Clarke agrees and they become intimate again.|$|E
2500|$|According to halakha, a get is {{only valid}} when it is given by a husband to his wife of his own free will (Yebamot, 14:1). However, under certain {{circumstances}} pressure may be applied on a husband {{to force him to}} grant a divorce to his wife. Where a woman has proven one or more of a list of particular grounds for divorce, the rabbinical court (beth din) may apply pressure on the husband in these situations (Ketubot, 7:10; Gittin, 9:8). There are some halakhic decisors who would act accordingly in the cases of abuse or neglect (Shulchan Aruch, Even HaEzer, 154:3). Nevertheless, not under all circumstances is a wife entitled to demand a divorce according to halakha. If a wife who is not halakhically entitled to a divorce does demand one, <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> considered as a mesorevet get by a Rabbinical Court. However, not any woman who wants to leave an unwanted marriage but is refused by her husband, {{is considered to be a}} victim of get refusal. There are opinions that deem a woman's repugnance for her husband as acceptable halakhic grounds for coercion (Rambam, Mishna Torah, Hilchot Ishut, 14:8). [...] "It is said: In cases of granting a get to a woman, the man is forced until he says, 'I wish to do so'" [...] (Babylonian Talmud, Arachin 21a; Rambam, Mishna Torah, Hilchot Gerushin, 2:2). Nevertheless, in almost all cases, it is required to leave the man some say in the matter, lest the get be considered a [...] "coerced divorce", which is halakhically invalid. As ruled by Rabbeinu Tam (Sefer HaYashar, Response 24; Rema, Even HaEzer 154:21), pressures that can be exerted against the man include shunning, denying him communal benefits and honors, and in extreme cases even imprisonment. Legend has it that as a last resort where all else has failed, a tactic has been sparingly used in the past, to let him spend a night near a nameless grave, or to frighten him in some other way. In Israel, rabbinical courts are allowed by law to implement various measures to persuade a man to grant his wife a get (Rabbinical Courts Law [...] 5755-1995). These sanctions are a modern-day version of the aforementioned, Harchakot D'Rabeinu Tam, which include: revoking of a driver's license, closing of bank accounts, revoking professional licenses such as medical and legal, cancellation of a passport, and incarceration. Practically, one of the most effective of these has turned out to be revoking a recalcitrant husband's driver's license. Even so, neither the laws nor the Israeli Rabbinical Courts' enforcement, or lack thereof, have succeeded in erasing the blight of get refusal within Israeli society. In the Diaspora, the Rabbinical Courts have no such powers. Any practical power that they may wield would be the product of a binding arbitration agreement (Prenuptial Agreement for the Prevention of Get-Refusal), if signed previously by the combating couple. Within the past decade, both Orthodox rabbinical groups and women's organizations have decried the increasing number of cases of get refusal, as well as establishing task forces to deal with the issue and to help individual victims of get refusal.|$|E
