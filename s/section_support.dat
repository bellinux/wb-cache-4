As such, it was to be a complete and powerful organisation with its own organic signals, engineering, transport, quartermaster and medical support. The company had a strength of 20 officers and 275 men (larger than a typical infantry company) and was divided into a headquarters and three platoons, with each platoon consisting of 75 men, commanded by a captain, with three sections below that, each commanded by a lieutenant. As firepower was deemed to be an essential element of the company's ability to conduct successful operations within the context as a raiding force, there was an abundance of automatic and <b>section</b> <b>support</b> weapons, including 0.303 Lee–Enfield sniper rifles (SMLEs), Bren light machine guns (LMGs), 2-inch mortars and Thompson and Owen submachine guns, to the extent that in battle each platoon could provide a level of firepower equivalent to that of an infantry company.|$|E

50|$|Ravensbourne is a {{national}} park in Ravensbourne and Buaraba in South East Queensland, Australia, 33 km west of Esk. It is a small scenic park on the Great Dividing Range within the Lockyer Creek water catchment area and overlooking the Lockyer Valley. Small remnants of the rainforest and wet eucalypt forest that once covered {{this part of the}} Great Dividing Range are preserved in Ravensbourne National Park. Red soils of the park's west and south-west support rainforest that includes eucalypt species as well as palms, vines and ferns. Sandy soils of the park's eastern <b>section</b> <b>support</b> open eucalypt forest. The park is situated in the water catchment areas of the Brisbane River and Lockyer Creek.|$|E

5000|$|The Canadians also {{operated}} {{an automatic}} variant, the C2A1, as a <b>section</b> <b>support</b> weapon, {{which was very}} similar to the Australian L2A1. It was similar to the FN FAL 50.41/42, but with wooden attachments to the bipod legs that work as a handguard when the legs are folded. The C2A1 used a tangent rear sight attached to the receiver cover with ranges from 200 to 1000 metres. The C1 was equipped with a 20-round magazine and the C2 with a 30-round magazine, although the two were interchangeable. Variants of the initial C1 and the product improved C1A1 were also made for the Royal Canadian Navy, which were capable of automatic fire, under the designations C1D and C1A1D. These weapons are identifiable by an A for [...] "automatic", carved or stamped into the butt stock. Boarding parties for domestic and international searches used these models.|$|E

50|$|There {{are some}} major themes {{based on the}} social {{conflicts}} in the novel. The first one states that the Christian ethic and spirituality was corruptive during the post war years in German society or even in Europe. Many examples in the Social Issues <b>section</b> <b>support</b> this statement. The second major theme {{is the loss of}} traditional familial and social unity. Hans was a clown but from a millionaire family. His family never supported him, even when he came back and asked for money. His brother came out of the support of the family when he converted to Catholicism. Furthermore, regarding Hans lost his sister during the war, his family preferred not to waste their wealth for their two sons. On the other side, Marie left him after five year because of the effects that forced her to feel sinful about her life and leave him to marry another person. All of these examples indicate the social unity and the families have some main problems. The third theme is there is no place for an artist with different ideologies from the people ruling the society. Although during the postwar years Germany did not have a dictator like Hitler to classify the people in the society, the effect of those years made the society do it automatically and indirectly based on ideologies of people.|$|E

50|$|The L7 {{general-purpose}} {{machine gun}} {{is used by}} the British Army. The L7 and the related L8 are license-built derivatives of the MAG. The official British Army designation for the current version is the L7A2 GPMG (General Purpose Machine Gun). The L7 was adopted by the British forces as a replacement for the long-serving Vickers machine gun (in the medium role) and the Bren (in the light assault role), following trials in 1957. Built under license originally by Royal Small Arms Factory, Enfield Lock and currently by Manroy Engineering, it serves in the British Army, the Royal Marines and other services. There have been two main variants, the L7A1 and L7A2, developed for infantry use, with the L7A2 having superseded the earlier variant. Several other variants have been developed, notably the L8 (produced in the L8A1 and L8A2 versions), modified for mounting inside armoured vehicles (the L37 variant was developed for mounting on armoured vehicles). Although intended to replace the Bren entirely, that light machine gun (re-titled as the L4) continued in use in jungle terrain (especially in the Far East), where there was no requirement for the medium machine gun role, and with secondary units, until the adoption of the L86A1 Light Support Weapon (LSW). The LSW was intended to replace both the L7 and the L4 in the light machine gun role, but dissatisfaction with the L86's sustained fire capabilities and reliability resulted in combat units continuing to utilize the L7 whenever possible (although neither it, nor its 7.62×51mm NATO ammunition were supposed to be issued to infantry platoons). The British Army and Royal Marines have since been issued with the L110A2 (FN Minimi Para) to replace the LSW as the light <b>section</b> <b>support</b> or fire support weapon. This uses the same NATO-standard 5.56×45mm ammunition as the L85 assault rifle. However, 7.62 mm L7 variants continue to be used in both dismounted roles and mounted on some British military vehicles, naval vessels, and aircraft.|$|E

This is also expected {{with respect to the}} high correlation between these two measures. However, the benefit of the T measure that distinguishes it from other measures is that time is explicitly taken into account. The experimental results in the next <b>section</b> <b>support</b> the assumption that the T measure can identify important attractors in time-varying networks while it boils down to indegree if time is neglected.|$|E

40|$|Nonpretreated high {{pressure}} frozen samples of Zea mays, cartilage and human erythrocytes were cryosectioned and observed at 110 K in a cryoelectron microscope. Changes induced by medium doses of electron irradiation (< 10 ke nm- 2) are described. After some ke nm- 2, {{the most conspicuous}} cutting artefacts are erased {{to a large extent}} and the visibility of the cell organelles is improved. The sections, compressed in the cutting direction by the sectioning process, shrink once more, in the same direction, when irradiated. This shrinkage depends on the <b>section</b> <b>support</b> and on how the section is adsorbed to it. Shrinkage is not uniform: it is most pronounced in mitochondria, condensed chromatin and nucleolus. This differential shrinkage improves the visibility of major structures on the section and, as a result, 'nicer' images are recorded. However, this apparent improvement is a beam-induced artefact that must be paired with a loss of high resolution information...|$|E
40|$|The {{pool boiling}} heat {{transfer}} and critical heat flux CHF of saturated HFE- 7100 at atmospheric pressure on a confined smooth copper surface were experimentally studied. The horizontal upward boiling surface was confined by a face-to-face parallel unheated surface. We analysed the effects obtained by changing {{the diameter of the}} unheated surface and the gap between the boiling surface and the adiabatic surface. The gap values investigated were s= 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, 3. 5. mm. To confine the circular boiling surface (d= 30. mm), two different Plexiglas discs were used: one with a diameter D= 30. mm, equal to that of the copper boiling surface, and the other with a diameter D= 60. mm, equal to that of the overall test <b>section</b> <b>support.</b> For each configuration, boiling curves were obtained up to the thermal crisis. For both configurations, it was observed that, at low wall superheat, the effect of confinement was not significant if Bo> 1, while for Bo≤ 1 the heat transfer coefficient increased as the channel width s decreased. By contrast, at high wall superheat, a drastic reduction in both heat transfer and CHF was seen when the channel width s decreased; this reduction was less pronounced when the smaller confinement disc (D= 30. mm) was used. CHF data were also compared with the values predicted by literature correlations...|$|E
