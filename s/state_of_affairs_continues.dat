Yet {{the vast majority}} of networked applications remain monolithically structured, in stark contravention of the ideal of least-privilege partitioning. Like others before us, we believe this <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continues</b> because today's operating systems offer isolation primitives that are cumbersome. We present Wedge, a system well suited to the splitting of complex, legacy, monolithic applications into ne-grained, least-privilege compartments. Wedge consists of two synergistic parts: OS primitives that create compartments with default-deny semantics, which force the programmer to make compartments ' privileges explicit; and Crowbar, a pair of run-time analysis tools that assist the programmer in determining which code needs which privileges for which memory objects. By implementing the Wedge system atop Linux, and applying it to the SSL-enabled Apache web server and the OpenSSH login server, we demonstrate that Wedge allows ne-grained compartmentalization of applications to prevent the leakage of sensitive data, at acceptable performance cost. We further show that Wedge is powerful enough to prevent a subtle man-in-the-middle attack that succeeds on a more coarsely privilege-separated Apache web server. ...|$|E
40|$|Most {{economic}} theory {{is based on}} the assumption that economies grow in a linear fashion. Recessions, depressions and (financial) crises are explained by policy mistakes. However, economic development has historically been uneven, and this <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continues</b> today. This book argues that twentieth century {{economic theory}} has marginalized individualism and organizational variety, and puts forward the case for a pluralist approach. This book represents a unique synthesis of business theory and economic theory, which pinpoints the problems with many current mainstream theories and sets out new agendas for research. Here, Maria Brouwer argues that market competition is not about adapting to changes from outside, but is driven by human motivation and goal directed behavior. This gives managerial skills, which do not traditionally have a significant place in mainstream economic theory, a key role. It also highlights the need for organizations that have a motivational culture and appreciate human capital. This differs from the traditional view of the firm as a production function dictated by technology. Brower argues that organizations should be depicted as voluntary associations of people that pursue goals of their own, while firms compete on markets, where relative performance determines their fate. This argument builds on older theories of innovation and market competition that live on in business school curricula, and paints a picture of an economy directed by individuals and firms. This signals a bold departure from standard economic thinking...|$|E

Introduction: The hope {{of our nation}} lies {{in the homes of}} its people to just the extent that these homes are what they should be. The {{question}} was once asked, “Does what people eat affect their moral natures”? The answer came “Most assuredly! After eating one of many of the dinners prepared at the present day, {{it would be impossible to}} live the Christian graces for the next twelve hours”. We may wonder why such a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continues,</b> and we find that it is chiefly because it has always been so. The kitchen is the laboratory of the house, and in it are performed some of the most important duties. The object should be to supply the family with good, wholesome, palatable, digestible food that will build up and strengthen both body and mind. It is just as easy to have well prepared and thoroughly cooked food as a poorly prepared article, if one will but take pains to learn how; and it is often much easier to prepare wholesome digestible food than much of the heavy pastry that we find on our American tables. In many of the kitchens we find a lack of system, not only in the arrangement and adjustment of furniture and utensils, but also in the articles themselves. We find in many articles that a trained housekeeper would have no use for, and at the same time a great lack of useful and even necessary articles—necessary at least from her point of view. It is with this need in view that this thesis is written...|$|E

40|$|Soil {{management}} in agricultural landscapes should deploy production {{practices that are}} in harmony with soil-mediated ecosystem functions {{if they are to}} deliver a broad range of ecosystem services. Such services include edible and nonedible biological products, clean drinking water, processes that decompose and transform organic matter, and cleansing processes that maintain air quality. Several categories of ecosystem services are recognized: provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment [MEA] 2005). In agricultural landscapes, provisioning ecosystem services can be delivered effectively and efficiently when the linked regulatory and supporting services are allowed to operate normally. Ecosystem functions that protect and enhance regulatory and supporting ecosystem services in the soil and landscape in which crops are grown appear, in general, to offer an effective way of harnessing the best productivity, ecological, and economic performances. Thus, agricultural soil management can only be considered sustainable if field soil health and productive capacity are kept at an optimum to provide ecosystem services such as provision of clean water, hydrologic and nutrient cycling, habitats for microorganisms and mesofauna, carbon sequestration, and climate regulation. Across agricultural and mixed land use landscapes, such ecosystem services form the necessary conditions for society to be able to sustainably harness the biological potentials of the altered agroecosystems and the associated provisioning services of food, vegetation, water, etc. In general, over the past several millennia, agricultural land use globally has led to soil physical, chemical, biological, and hydrological degradation, and this <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continues</b> unabated in most farmlands (MEA 2005; Montgomery 2007; FAO 2011 a). This is true on small and large farms, on farms using mechanized or manual farm power, in developing and in industrialized countries, in the tropics, and outside the tropics. The dominant farming systems paradigm globally is based on mechani- cal tillage of various types to control weeds (often along with herbicides), soften the seedbed for crop establishment, and loosen compacted subsoil. At the center of this paradigm, there are farming practices for crop, soil, nutrient, water, and pest management that are considered by most agricultural stakeholders to be “modern, good, and normal. ” However, the same farming practices have also forced farmers to accept that, supposedly, any accompanying soil degradation and loss of ecosystem services are inevitable and “natural” consequences of farming—consequences that can be kept under control but not avoided altogether. This view is increasingly being challenged and considered to be outdated, and inherited farming practices are considered unable to deliver the multifunctional objectives of productivity with ecosystem services now being demanded from agricultural land and producers who use it for farming. In the past three decades, ideas and concepts, as well as an ecosystem approach to sustainable production intensification, have led to the emergence of an alternative approach to farming across all continents. The title of this chapter is “Sustainable Soil Management Is More Than What and How Crops Are Grown. ” Not only how and what crops are grown matters but also the interactions of the two in space and time lead to effects and consequences that influence system performance and delivery of ecosystem services. Some ecosystem services involve processes such as hydrological, carbon, and nutrient cycling that operate {{at the level of the}} fields on farms, landscapes, watersheds, and beyond. In addition, agricultural soil management is undertaken within different farming systems for the purpose of producing biological products for markets, and a range of production inputs, equipment and machinery, and management skills are needed to operate successfully. Thus, the topic of sustainable soil management has a wide and complex scope as reflected in the list of 10 tenets proposed by Lal (2009). This chapter is about soil degradation in agricultural land, its root causes, and what solutions are being implemented in different parts of the world to integrate sustainable soil {{management in}}to sustainable farming and landscape management. Section 14. 2 describes what is meant by agricultural soil degradation and its extent. Section 14. 3 provides an explanation of some of the major causes of soil degradation in agricultural land use and illustrates three cases of widespread soil degradation in contrasting environments. This is followed, in Section 14. 4, by a discussion on the elements of sustainable soil management. Section 14. 5 provides an elaboration of sustainable soil management based on the agroecological paradigm that is increasingly being promoted internation- ally, including how sustainable soil management has been able to restore degraded soils in different agricultural environments. Section 14. 6 illustrates the kind of contributions crop management, intercropping, crop–livestock integration, and farm power that can make to sustainable soil management objective. Section 14. 7 presents three examples of large-scale landscape level ecosystem service benefits that are being harnessed from sustainable soil management systems. This is followed by Section 14. 8 on policy and institutional implications for sustainable soil management. Section 14. 9 offers some concluding remarks regarding the current trend toward sustainable soil management and what policy makers can do to support the trend...|$|E
