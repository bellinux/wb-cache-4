25|$|When {{confronted by}} humans, coral snakes will almost always attempt to flee, and bite {{only as a}} last resort. In addition, coral snakes have short fangs (proteroglyph dentition) that cannot {{penetrate}} thick leather clothing. Any <b>skin</b> <b>penetration,</b> however, is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention. Coral snakes have a powerful neurotoxin that paralyzes the breathing muscles; mechanical or artificial respiration, along with large doses of antivenom, are often required to save a victim's life. There is usually only mild pain associated with a bite, but respiratory failure can occur within hours.|$|E
25|$|N. americanus and A. duodenale eggs can {{be found}} in warm, moist soil where they will {{eventually}} hatch into first stage larvae, or L1. L1, the feeding non-infective rhabditoform stage, will feed on soil microbes and eventually molt into second stage larvae, L2. L2, which is also in the rhabditoform stage, will feed for approximately 7 days and then molt into the third stage larvae, or L3. L3 is the filariform stage of the parasite, that is, the non-feeding infective form of the larvae. The L3 larvae are extremely motile and will seek higher ground to increase their chances of penetrating the skin of a human host. The L3 larvae can survive up to 2 weeks without finding a host. While N. americanus larvae only infect through penetration of skin, A. duodenale can infect both through penetration as well as orally. After the L3 larvae have successfully entered the host, the larvae then travel through the subcutaneous venules and lymphatic vessels of the human host. Eventually, the L3 larvae enter the lungs through the pulmonary capillaries and break out into the alveoli. They will then travel up the trachea to be coughed and swallowed by the host. After being swallowed, the L3 larvae are then found in the small intestine where they molt into the L4, or adult worm stage. The entire process from <b>skin</b> <b>penetration</b> to adult development takes about 5–9 weeks. The female adult worms will release eggs (N. americanus about 9,000–10,000 eggs/day and A. duodenale 25,000–30,000 eggs/day) which are passed in the feces of the human host. These eggs will hatch in the environment within several days and the cycle will start anew.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Our primary {{objective}} was to describe the time to vessel penetration and difficulty of long-axis and short-axis approaches for ultrasound-guided small vessel penetration in novice sonographers experienced with landmark-based small vessel penetration. Methods: This was a prospective, observational study of experienced certified emergency nurses attempting ultrasound-guided small vessel cannulation on a vascular access phantom. We conducted a standardized training, practice, and experiment session for each participant. Five long-axis and five short-axis approaches were attempted in alternating sequence. The primary outcome was time to vessel penetration. Secondary outcomes were number of <b>skin</b> <b>penetrations</b> and number of catheter redirections. We compared long-axis and short-axis approaches using multivariable regression adjusting for repeated measures, vessel depth, and vessel caliber. Results: Each of 10 novice sonographers made 10 attempts {{for a total of}} 100 attempts. Median time to vessel penetration in the long-axis and short-axis was 11 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 7 - 12) and 10 (95 % CI 6 - 13) seconds, respectively. <b>Skin</b> <b>penetrations</b> and catheter redirections were equivalent and near optimal between approaches. The median caliber of cannulated vessels in the long-axis and short-axis was 4. 6 (95 % CI 4. 1 - 5. 5) and 5. 6 (95 % CI 5. 1 - 6. 2) millimeters, respectively. Both axes had equal success rates of 100 % for all 50 attempts. In multivariable regression analysis, long-axis attempts were 32 % (95 % CI 11 %- 48 %; p= 0. 009) faster than short-axis attempts. Conclusion: Novice sonographers, highly proficient with peripheral IV cannulation, can perform after instruction ultrasound-guided small vessel penetration successfully with similar time to vessel penetration in either the long-axis or short-axis approach on phantom models.  [West J Emerg Med. 2014; 15 (7) :– 0. ...|$|R

Thus, skin is a largest integumentary organ that can be approached to deliver different drugs or active compounds by topical or transdermal route. Active and passive <b>skin</b> <b>penetrations</b> have been achieved {{over the last few}} decades, improving the efficiency of either transdermal delivery (the drugs are delivered into subcutaneous tissue, therefore, taken up systemically into the body) or topical delivery (this method allows the drug delivery into skin strata). Topical therapies are an alternative treatment for several types of skin disorder as skin cancer, contact dermatitis, and psoriasis, which the drugs are delivered directly into skin strata (Zhang et al. 2014). Transdermal and topical delivery systems ensure additional advantages over other delivery routes, viz.: provide enhanced biocompatibility by evading the hepatic first-pass metabolism, support patient compliance by decreasing the drug dosage {{and at the same time}} maintaining the therapeutic effect of the drug, and enhance the bioavailability of the therapeutic agent at the targeted tissue or cells.
