500|$|... "Q Who" [...] went $50,000 {{over budget}} {{and at one}} point had an eighth day of {{shooting}} arranged, although this was subsequently cancelled. The overspending on this episode and [...] "Elementary, Dear Data" [...] resulted in the budget-saving production of the clip show [...] "". Director Rob Bowman was concerned with [...] "Q Who" [...] for a while, saying that [...] "we didn't know day to day if we were making a <b>stinker</b> or a winner".|$|E
500|$|Though {{the episode}} was {{produced}} {{at the end}} of the first season [...] "Unearthed" [...] first aired during the second season, on January 11, 2010, in a one-time timeslot. An estimated 7.79 million viewers tuned into the episode, giving it a [...] "whopping" [...] ratings improvement over its best ratings of the season. It was included in the second season's DVD release as a special feature. The episode was almost unanimously disliked by critics, with one reviewer calling it [...] "a <b>stinker</b> that should have remained safely out of public view." [...] Numerous critics also disliked guest actress Alice Kremelberg's performance, particularly when her character becomes possessed by a male ghost.|$|E
5000|$|Lancaster and Wright {{offered the}} annual <b>Stinkers</b> Bad Movie Awards, {{which was a}} parody of the Academy Awards. The <b>Stinkers</b> were similar to the Golden Raspberry Award (the [...] "Razzies"), which debuted {{four years after the}} <b>Stinkers.</b> Aside from the usual {{categories}} one might expect in an Oscar parody (Worst Picture, Worst Actor, etc.), the <b>Stinkers</b> offered other categories such as Worst Fake Accent, Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy, Least 'Special' Special Effects and Worst On-Screen Hairstyle. Unlike the Razzies, the <b>Stinkers</b> did not have an awards ceremony.|$|R

The next year the <b>Stinkers</b> made a special trophy of a {{miniature}} flushing toilet for comedian actor Tom Green. Green's Freddy Got Fingered was nominated for seven awards and won Worst Film, Worst Sense of Direction, Worst Actor and Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy. That same year the <b>Stinkers</b> gave a special award to David Manning, the controversial Sony Pictures fictitious movie critic. The <b>Stinkers</b> included in 2003 another special category for Worst Performance by a Child, dedicated to child actor Spencer Breslin.|$|R
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to this iteration of the Dalton saga was sharp. [...] Drew Fetherston, reviewing the movie for Newsday, called it [...] "claptrap" [...] and that [...] "action [...] is all that this NBC <b>stinker</b> has to offer". Faye Zuckerman of the Gainesville Sun called Dalton: Code of Vengeance II a [...] "plodder", complaining that [...] "this film insults its predecessor". Chicago Sun-Times reviewer Daniel Ruth gave Dalton: Code of Vengeance II a half-star review calling it [...] "revisionist", [...] "distasteful", and [...] "terrible television". Deriding the film as [...] "poorly written, badly acted, sloppily directed and choppily edited", he called it [...] "another {{slap in the face}} of the men and women who went to Southeast Asia to do a dirty job and came home to even dirtier exploitation". Ruth concluded, [...] "The viewer's best [...] "Code of Vengeance" [...] would be to reject these films." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{there were}} exceptions, Terry-Thomas's screen {{characters}} were generally similar; Geoff Mayer wrote that [...] "although {{there would be}} variations, he would remain the 'rotter', a pretentious, elitist, seedy, sometimes lecherous cad with an eye for quick money and the easy life". Eric Sykes, with whom Terry-Thomas shared a number of screen moments, stated that it was [...] "always the same character and always funny". Andrew Spicer, writing for the British Film Institute, called him [...] "the definitive postwar cad or rotter". Terry-Thomas himself agreed with the view he presented, writing in the 1980s that [...] "T-T with his permanent air of caddish disdain... bounder... aristocratic rogue... upper-class English twit... genuine English eccentric... {{one of the last}} real gentlemen... wet, genteel Englishman... high-bred idiot... cheeky blighter... camel-haired cad... amiable buffoon... pompous Englishman... twentieth-century dandy... <b>stinker...</b> king of the cads... All those descriptions added up to my image as Terry-Thomas".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed-to-positive reviews. Ryan McGee of Zap2it {{wrote that}} [...] "this episode wasn't a <b>stinker</b> by any measure, {{but after the}} run of early episodes, {{this is the first}} that really didn't hold its own when compared to the others", adding that [...] "The moth imagery/metaphor just beats you down by episode's end, making you long for the more subtle writing the show has produced up until this point." [...] The TV Critic gave the episode a 68/100, writing that it falls between being [...] "obvious and cheesy" [...] and [...] "beautifully paced and structured". Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, and shared his opinion that it is [...] "one of the more intensely metaphorical—and thus writerly—episodes of the series. The eponymous metaphor—delivered by Locke—is one of the series’ most blatant, and the moth’s consistent reappearance in the episode calls {{a lot of attention to}} the construction of the narrative." ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was generally negative. The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded the episode with a C-, explaining he didn't {{want to watch}} a season one cast-off, {{and that some of}} the episode moments were [...] "generic embarrassing", such as when Olivia tricked someone into telling her Rusk was sick and when Rusk failed to kill his wife after falling into the [...] "old Fallacy Of The Talking Killer" [...] cliche. New Yorks Tim Grierson thought it was [...] "the lamest in recent memory" [...] and [...] "a <b>stinker</b> that should have remained safely out of public view". He did however remark that the episode allowed him to see how far the show had improved since its first season. In a slightly more positive review, MTV's Josh Wigler wrote [...] "As far as standard installments of Fringe go, 'Unearthed' ranks somewhere {{in the middle of the}} pack, but the quality diminishes due to its awkward placement in the middle of season two". IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 6.4/10, commenting that it was [...] "cheesy, with mediocre writing and some fairly bad performances from the guest supporting cast". Isler found little to redeem the episode, and wished the story's partial focus on the intersection of science and faith had been further explored.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} {{generally}} panned by critics. Metacritic compiled a 26% rating based on 15 reviews.

2500|$|Leonard Kladly of Variety {{wrote that}} the film is [...] "too broad and episodic to attract {{anything}} other than the most undemanding crowd". Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle described it as a [...] "tolerable <b>stinker</b> of a film" [...] that [...] "plays like a Saturday morning cartoon". Lawrence Van Gelder of The New York Times stated that the film is [...] "slow to gather momentum and generates little excitement or tension". Shaquille O'Neal earned a Razzie Award nomination as Worst Actor for his performance in the film, but lost against Kevin Costner for The Postman.|$|E

2500|$|In 1998 {{wreckage}} {{found at}} <b>Stinker</b> Point {{on the south}} western side of Elephant Island was incorrectly identified as flotsam from the ship. However, it belonged to the 1877 wreck of the Connecticut sealing ship Charles Shearer. [...] In 2001 wreck hunter David Mearns unsuccessfully planned an expedition to find {{the wreck of the}} Endurance. [...] By 2003 two rival groups were making plans for an expedition to find the wreck, however no expedition was actually mounted. In 2010 Mearns announced a new plan to search for the wreck. The plan is sponsored by the National Geographic Society but is subject to finding sponsorship for the balance of the US$10 million estimated cost.

2500|$|In 1983 Dahl {{reviewed}} Tony Clifton's God Cried, {{a picture}} {{book about the}} siege of West Beirut by the Israeli army during the 1982 Lebanon War. Dahl's review stated that the book would make readers [...] "violently anti-Israeli", writing, [...] "I am not anti-Semitic. I am anti-Israel." [...] Dahl told a reporter in 1983, [...] "There's a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity ... I mean {{there is always a}} reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a <b>stinker</b> like Hitler didn't just pick on them for no reason." [...] Dahl maintained friendships with a number of Jews, including philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin, who said, [...] "I thought he might say anything. Could have been pro-Arab or pro-Jew. There was no consistent line. He was a man who followed whims, which meant he would blow up in one direction, so to speak." [...] Amelia Foster, director of the Roald Dahl Museum in Great Missenden, states, [...] "This is again an example of how Dahl refused to take anything seriously, even himself. He was very angry at the Israelis. He had a childish reaction {{to what was going on}} in Israel. Dahl wanted to provoke, as he always provoked at dinner. His publisher was a Jew, his agent was a Jew... and he thought nothing but good things of them. He asked me to be his managing director, and I'm Jewish." ...|$|E
2500|$|Time observed, [...] "Porgy and Bess {{is only a}} {{moderate}} and intermittent success as a musical show; {{as an attempt to}} produce a great work of cinematic art, it is a sometimes ponderous failure [...] [...] [...] On the stage the show has an intimate, itch-and-scratch-it folksiness that makes even the dull spots endearing. On the colossal Todd-AO screen, Catfish Row covers a territory that looks almost as big as a football field, and the action often feels about as intimate as a line play seen from the second tier. What the actors are saying or singing comes blaring out of a dozen stereophonic loudspeakers in such volume that the spectator almost continually feels trapped {{in the middle of a}} cheering section. The worst thing about Goldwyn's Porgy, though, is its cinematic monotony. The film is not so much a motion picture as a photographed opera [...] [...] [...] Still, there are some good things about the show. Sammy Davis Jr., looking like an absurd Harlemization of Chico Marx, makes a wonderfully silly <b>stinker</b> out of Sportin' Life. The singing is generally good — particularly the comic bits by Pearl Bailey and the ballads by Adele Addison [...] [...] [...] And the color photography gains a remarkable lushness through the use of filters, though in time [...] [...] [...] the spectator may get tired of the sensation that he is watching the picture through amber-colored sunglasses." ...|$|E
