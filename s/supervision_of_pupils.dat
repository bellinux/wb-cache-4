Bampton S.J., rector 1901-1908, {{replaced}} the traditional Jesuit arrangement of close <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>pupils</b> by masters of discipline {{with the so-called}} [...] "Captain" [...] system, or government of boys by boys - perhaps inspired by the reforms of Thomas Arnold at Rugby in the 1830s. Bampton's Captain system was adopted also at Stonyhurst and at sister Jesuit schools in France and Spain, and in 1906 Beaumont {{was admitted to the}} Headmasters' Conference. Beaumont thus became, along with Stonyhurst College in Lancashire and St Aloysius' College, Glasgow, one of three public schools maintained by the English Province of the Jesuits.|$|E

50|$|He {{received}} his instruction in architecture {{in the service}} of his 'kinsman,' Roger Morris, 'Carpenter and principal engineer to the Board of Ordnance,' who died on 31 January 1749. The earliest executed work ascribed to Morris is Inveraray Castle (Gothic), begun in 1745, and after considerable delay completed in 1761. It seems probable that Roger Morris was concerned in the design, and that the building was erected after his death under the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> his <b>pupil</b> Robert. The central tower was destroyed by fire on 12 Oct. 1877, and restored in 1880. With S. Wright, Morris erected for George II the central portion of the lodge in Richmond Park, the design of which is sometimes attributed to Thomas Herbert, 10th earl of Pembroke. The wings were added in later years.|$|R
40|$|The SUMUME project “Enseignement avec SUpports MultiMEdias” (teaching with {{multi-media}} support) is {{the product}} of a collaboration between the canton of Neuchâtel (the Department of Public Instruction and Cultural Affairs), a business enterprise (BIP Info SA) and a university department (the Institute of Psychology of the University of Neuchâtel). It involved the production by practicing teachers of three sequences of teaching with multi-media support – in French, mathematics, and history- geography. The involved teachers developed tools suited to their particular needs and the didactic of their subjects. It rapidly became apparent that the educational software had the effect of transforming their modes of teaching in interesting ways. In particular it created the opportunity to take on another role: they became conceivers of the instruments of learning, organisers, coaches and advisors, all the while remaining engaged in the transmission of knowledge but with the benefit of a more personalised <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> their <b>pupils.</b> And they found their viewpoint changed: it was no longer by facing the class but from the back of it that they understood their students better...|$|R

40|$|Supervision {{in school}} often {{discussed}} about the negative opinion of teachers because misunderstanding {{about the process}} and the concept <b>of</b> <b>supervision.</b> Thus, this descriptive study was conducted through a questionnaire survey on three schools in the Zone City Muar Johor.

The Jews of Baghdad had two hospitals in which the poor received free treatment, and several philanthropic services. Out of sixty synagogues in 1950, there remained only seven after 1970. Most public buildings were seized by the government for paltry or no compensation. Those Jewish refugees have been fed, housed and absorbed by Israel.|$|R
