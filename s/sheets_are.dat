5|$|A {{permanent}} {{exhibit of}} {{items from the}} Collections is {{on display in the}} British Library entrance area upper ground floor, which may be the best gallery of diverse classic stamps and philatelic material in the world. Approximately 80,000 items on 6,000 sheets may be viewed in 1,000 display frames; 2,400 <b>sheets</b> <b>are</b> from the Tapling Collection. Other material, which covers the whole world, is available to students and researchers by appointment.|$|E
5|$|Some stamps {{were issued}} {{in the form}} of a {{miniature}} sheet comprising from one to sixteen stamps of a single, or multiple, design from one issue printed on the same sheet and sold in that format. The miniature <b>sheets</b> <b>are</b> most often produced in addition to the same designs issued as single stamps.|$|E
5|$|The polyps are {{connected}} by horizontal sheets of tissue known as coenosarc extending over the outer {{surface of the}} skeleton and completely covering it. These <b>sheets</b> <b>are</b> continuous with the body wall of the polyps, and include extensions of the gastrovascular cavity, so that food and water can circulate between all the different members of the colony.|$|E
5000|$|The second <b>sheet</b> <b>is</b> not {{attached}} and is milky white. Normally this <b>sheet</b> <b>is</b> to {{be disposed}} before printing.|$|R
50|$|Following {{completion}} of the census, the original enumeration <b>sheets</b> <b>were</b> microfilmed; after which the original <b>sheets</b> <b>were</b> destroyed.|$|R
50|$|A {{translucent}} acrylic <b>sheet</b> <b>is</b> {{used as a}} {{rear projection}} screen to display information. The edges of the acrylic <b>sheet</b> <b>are</b> illuminated by infrared LEDs, and infrared cameras {{are focused on the}} back of the sheet. Objects placed on the <b>sheet</b> <b>are</b> detectable by the cameras. When the <b>sheet</b> <b>is</b> touched by the user the deformation results in leakage of infrared light, which peaks at the points of maximum pressure indicating the user's touch location. Microsoft's PixelSense tables use this technology.|$|R
5|$|Lead {{has many}} uses in the {{construction}} industry; lead <b>sheets</b> <b>are</b> used as architectural metals in roofing material, cladding, flashing, gutters and gutter joints, and on roof parapets. Detailed lead moldings are used as decorative motifs to fix lead sheet. Lead is still used in statues and sculptures, including for armatures. In the past it was often used to balance the wheels of cars; for environmental reasons this use is being phased {{out in favor of}} other materials.|$|E
5|$|Thermotropic chiral LCs whose pitch varies {{strongly}} with temperature {{can be used}} as crude liquid crystal thermometers, since the color of the material will change as the pitch is changed. Liquid crystal color transitions are used on many aquarium and pool thermometers as well as on thermometers for infants or baths. Other liquid crystal materials change color when stretched or stressed. Thus, liquid crystal <b>sheets</b> <b>are</b> often used in industry to look for hot spots, map heat flow, measure stress distribution patterns, and so on. Liquid crystal in fluid form is used to detect electrically generated hot spots for failure analysis in the semiconductor industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{amorphous}} form is {{an assortment}} of carbon atoms in a non-crystalline, irregular, glassy state, not held in a crystalline macrostructure. It is present as a powder, and is the main constituent of substances such as charcoal, lampblack (soot) and activated carbon. At normal pressures, carbon {{takes the form of}} graphite, in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three others in a plane composed of fused hexagonal rings, just like those in aromatic hydrocarbons. The resulting network is 2-dimensional, and the resulting flat <b>sheets</b> <b>are</b> stacked and loosely bonded through weak van der Waals forces. This gives graphite its softness and its cleaving properties (the sheets slip easily past one another). Because of the delocalization of one of the outer electrons of each atom to form a π-cloud, graphite conducts electricity, but only in the plane of each covalently bonded sheet. This results in a lower bulk electrical conductivity for carbon than for most metals. The delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of graphite over diamond at room temperature.|$|E
40|$|Solutions of the {{nonlinear}} water wave equations {{under an}} ice <b>sheet</b> <b>are</b> computed using a boundary integral equation method. The ice <b>sheet</b> <b>is</b> modelled as a thin elastic plate and the fluid equations are nonlinear. Depending on {{the velocity of}} the moving disturbance generating the flow, different types of responses of the floating ice <b>sheet</b> <b>are</b> discussed...|$|R
50|$|The stamp {{images for}} the first five <b>sheets</b> <b>were</b> {{selected}} by Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee and those for the remaining five <b>sheets</b> <b>were</b> selected by a nationwide poll.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Animation of the {{thermoforming}} process. 1- The plastic <b>sheet</b> <b>is</b> heated. 2- The <b>sheet</b> <b>is</b> {{formed to}} a specific shape in a mold. 3- The shapes are trimmed.|$|R
25|$|Remaining {{on their}} boards, the pounded <b>sheets</b> <b>are</b> taken outside to dry. Drying times vary due to weather {{conditions}}. On dry and sunny days, this can take {{an hour or}} two, but in humid conditions it can take days. If the dried <b>sheets</b> <b>are</b> to be sold wholesale, they are then simply bundled. If to be sold retail, the edges are then trimmed with a blade.|$|E
25|$|PTFE <b>sheets</b> <b>are</b> {{used in the}} {{production}} of butane hash oil due to its non-stick properties and resistance to non-polar solvents.|$|E
25|$|Acrylic <b>Sheets</b> <b>are</b> {{produced}} {{in dozens of}} standard colors, most commonly sold using color numbers developed by Rohm & Haas in the 1950s.|$|E
30|$|The <b>sheet</b> <b>is</b> {{assumed to}} have the {{velocity}} U=cx where x is the coordinate measured along the stretching surface and c(> 0) is a constant for a stretching sheet. Likewise, the temperature distribution for the <b>sheet</b> <b>is</b> assumed {{to be in the}} form T_w=T_∞+Ax^r where T_w is the temperature of the <b>sheet,</b> T_∞ <b>is</b> the temperature of the ambient, A and r are constants. Also, the <b>sheet</b> <b>is</b> assumed to be porous with the suction velocity v_w> 0.|$|R
50|$|The term bed <b>sheet</b> <b>was</b> {{first used}} in the 15th century. Bed <b>sheets</b> <b>were</b> {{traditionally}} white and made of linen, cotton or silk, but now various colors and patterns are used.|$|R
30|$|A fresh shale <b>sheet</b> <b>was</b> {{put into}} a GO {{solution}} (0.001  wt%) for 10  h at room temperature, and then the <b>sheet</b> <b>was</b> dried at 60  °C for 24  h. These shale <b>sheets</b> <b>were</b> adhered to the special mold by adhesive tape, and then the mold was vacuum-coated with gold for 2  min. Samples were imaged with a scanning electron microscope (Quanta 200 F, FEI, Netherlands).|$|R
25|$|Each domain {{comprises}} two β-pleated sheets. The <b>sheets</b> <b>are</b> {{linked by}} a disulfide bridge and together form a roughly barrel-shaped structure {{known as a}} β-barrel.|$|E
25|$|The {{holographic}} security foil is then incorporated to {{the base}} substrate. This is then cut and the <b>sheets</b> <b>are</b> spooled onto a roll, which is transported to the banknote printing companies in wooden boxes as a secure shipment.|$|E
25|$|Polypropylene <b>sheets</b> <b>are</b> {{a popular}} choice for trading card collectors; these come with pockets (nine for standard-size cards) for the cards to be {{inserted}} {{and are used}} to protect their condition and {{are meant to be}} stored in a binder.|$|E
30|$|The glass {{substrates}} and polycarbonate <b>sheets</b> <b>were</b> washed {{first by}} detergent and water, {{in order and}} they were rinsed with deionized water. These <b>sheets</b> <b>were</b> more cleaned by 2 -propanol and then acetone ultrasonically and were rinsed again with water and then were dried. The surface of PC <b>sheets</b> <b>was</b> made by adding dropwise of 37.5  ml H 2 SO 4 to 4  g K 2 Cr 2 O 7 {{and then by the}} addition of 12.5  ml water. Cooling the solution to room temperature, the PC <b>sheets</b> <b>were</b> sunk in the solution for 17  min.|$|R
40|$|Moisture {{distribution}} {{through the}} thickness of plywood is analyzed when the <b>sheet</b> <b>is</b> subjected to different relative air humidity from both sides using one dimensional diffusion equation. The shape change of plywood <b>sheet</b> <b>is</b> numerically analyzed when moisture influence {{from both sides of}} <b>sheet</b> <b>is</b> not time – dependent, and also when one side of the <b>sheet</b> <b>is</b> subjected to time-dependent outside moisture-temperature conditions and conditions on other side is not time-dependent. The outdoor moisture-temperature conditions were taken form national standard LBN- 003 - 01 “Būvklimatoloģija” and approximated with third order polynomial using its average values summed with average amplitude...|$|R
40|$|Polymer solutions, {{containing}} clay <b>sheets,</b> <b>were</b> electrospun into nanofibers and microfibers {{that contained}} clay sheets inside. Controllable removal of polymer by plasma etching {{from the surface}} of fibers revealed the arrangement of clay. The shape, flexibility, size distribution and arrangement of clay <b>sheets</b> <b>were</b> observed by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The clay <b>sheets</b> <b>were</b> partially aligned in big fibers with normal direction of clay sheets perpendicular to fiber axis. Crumpling of clay <b>sheets</b> inside fibers <b>was</b> observed when the fiber diameter was comparable to the lateral size of clay sheets. Single <b>sheets</b> of clay <b>were</b> observed both by catching clay sheets dispersed in water with electrospun nanofiber mats and by the deliberate removal of most of the polymer in the fibers. Thin, flexible gas barrier films, that are reasonably strong, were assembled from clay sheets and polymer nanofibers. Structure of composite films was characterized with scanning electron microscopy. Continuous film of clay <b>sheets</b> <b>were</b> physically attached to the surface of fiber mats. Spincoating film of polymer and clay <b>sheets</b> <b>was</b> reinforced by electrospun fiber scaffold. Certain alignment of clay <b>sheets</b> <b>was</b> observed in the vicinity of fibers...|$|R
25|$|A common {{application}} for polypropylene is as biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP). These BOPP <b>sheets</b> <b>are</b> {{used to make}} a wide variety of materials including clear bags. When polypropylene is biaxially oriented, it becomes crystal clear and serves as an excellent packaging material for artistic and retail products.|$|E
25|$|It has an all-beta structure, {{whereby the}} {{two pairs of}} {{antiparallel}} beta <b>sheets</b> <b>are</b> connected by a diagonally running extended beta-sheet. The sheets then further fold to form a beta prism in which each wall is composed of {{a complete set of}} five beta-strands. The GIN domain is often followed by a neck domain.|$|E
25|$|The galectin {{carbohydrate}} recognition domain (CRD) {{is constructed}} from beta-sheet of about 135 amino acids. The two <b>sheets</b> <b>are</b> slightly bent with 6 strands forming the concave side and 5 strands forming the convex side. The concave side forms a groove {{in which the}} carbohydrate ligand can bind, and which is long enough to hold about a linear tetrasaccharide.|$|E
25|$|The {{side chains}} from the amino acid {{residues}} {{found in a}} β-sheet structure may also be arranged such {{that many of the}} adjacent sidechains {{on one side of the}} <b>sheet</b> <b>are</b> hydrophobic, while many of those adjacent to each other on the alternate side of the <b>sheet</b> <b>are</b> polar or charged (hydrophilic), which can be useful if the <b>sheet</b> <b>is</b> to form a boundary between polar/watery and nonpolar/greasy environments.|$|R
25|$|The first {{souvenir}} <b>sheet</b> <b>was</b> {{issued for}} Universal Postal Union Day on 9 October 1971. It <b>was</b> an imperforate <b>sheet</b> valued at 70p. There were no leaflets or first day covers released and 10,000 <b>sheets</b> <b>were</b> printed.|$|R
50|$|The {{first four}} <b>sheets</b> <b>were</b> {{published}} in 1964, {{and the final}} sheets of the first edition in 1976. <b>Sheet</b> <b>were</b> published in several versions: a full version, a version without contours (for social science thematic mapping) and a version without placenames and infrastructure (for scientific thematic mapping). The title of each <b>sheet</b> <b>was</b> given in Cyrillic and Latin alphabets, but all placenames on the map itself were given only in the Latin alphabet.|$|R
25|$|Contourite <b>sheets</b> <b>are</b> broad, low-relief {{features}} that extend through very large areas (i.e. ~1,000,000 km2) and are seen covering the abyssal plains or even plastered against the continental margins. They {{are characteristic of}} very deep water. They have a relatively constant thickness of up to a few hundred meters with a slight thinning towards the continental margin.|$|E
25|$|The <b>sheets</b> <b>are</b> divided {{from each}} other either square to the map grid, or along the meridians and parallels. In the first case, the sheets will all be the same size. In the second case, the sheet size will {{decrease}} towards the north (for a northern hemisphere map) or the south (for a southern hemisphere map).|$|E
25|$|Phyllosilicates {{consist of}} sheets of {{polymerized}} tetrahedra. They are bound at three oxygen sites, which gives a characteristic silicon:oxygen ratio of 2:5. Important {{examples include the}} mica, chlorite, and the kaolinite-serpentine groups. The <b>sheets</b> <b>are</b> weakly bound by van der Waals forces or hydrogen bonds, which causes a crystallographic weakness, in turn leading to a prominent basal cleavage among the phyllosilicates. In addition to the tetrahedra, phyllosilicates have a sheet of octahedra (elements in six-fold coordination by oxygen) that balanced out the basic tetrahedra, which have a negative charge (e.g. 4−) These tetrahedra (T) and octahedra (O) <b>sheets</b> <b>are</b> stacked {{in a variety of}} combinations to create phyllosilicate groups. Within an octahedral sheet, there are three octahedral sites in a unit structure; however, not all of the sites may be occupied. In that case, the mineral is termed dioctahedral, whereas in other case it is termed trioctahedral.|$|E

The firehose instability is precisely complementary, in this sense, to the Jeans {{instability in the}} plane, which is stabilized at short wavelengths, [...]|$|R
30|$|The {{interaction}} between GO sheets and MMT <b>sheets</b> <b>was</b> studied. GO <b>sheets</b> and MMT <b>sheets</b> <b>were</b> repelled through electrostatic repulsion. There {{were a few}} negative charges {{at the edges of}} GO sheets and on the surface of MMT sheets. The hydroxyl groups of GO were attracted by the oxygen atoms through hydrogen bonds. An equilibrium was reached between repulsive and attractive forces. With enhancement of the attractive force, the equilibrium was broken, and then GO <b>sheets</b> <b>were</b> adsorbed on the surface of MMT sheets and some GO sheets inserted into the interlayer space of MMT. The adsorption and insertion of GO <b>sheets</b> <b>were</b> the main mechanism to form a stable assembly structure based on GO nano-sheets and MMT sheets.|$|R
40|$|Corrosion {{behavior}} of nano-coblat-coated Ni <b>sheet</b> <b>was</b> compared with pure Ni and 20 % Fe-Ni alloy sheet using potentiodynamic polarization and linear polarization technique in 0. 1 [*]M NaCl solution at room temperature. Results showed that corrosion resistance properties of nano-Co-coated Ni <b>sheet</b> <b>were</b> almost {{same as that}} of pure Ni sheet, however corrosion resistance of 20 % Fe-Ni <b>sheet</b> <b>was</b> decreased significantly. Pitting potential of 20 % Fe-Ni <b>sheet</b> <b>was</b> subsequently decreased as compared to pure Ni sheet as well as nano-cobalt-coated Ni sheet. SEM/EDS analysis of the corroded surfaces showed that both pure Ni and nano-coblat-coated Ni sheet did not show any appreciable corrosion however significant corrosion was observed in the case of 20 % Fe-Ni sheet...|$|R
