40|$|<b>Sox</b> 5 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 6 encode Sry-related {{transcription}} {{factors that}} redundantly promote early chondroblast differentiation. Using mouse embryos {{with three or}} four null alleles of <b>Sox</b> 5 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 6, we show that they are also essential and redundant in major steps of growth plate chondrocyte differentiation. <b>Sox</b> 5 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 6 promote the development of a highly proliferating pool of chondroblasts between the epiphyses and metaphyses of future long bones. This pool is the likely cellular source of growth plates. <b>Sox</b> 5 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 6 permit formation of growth plate columnar zones by keeping chondroblasts proliferating and by delaying chondrocyte prehypertrophy. They allow induction of chondrocyte hypertrophy and permit formation of prehypertrophic and hypertrophic zones by delaying chondrocyte terminal differentiation induced by ossification fronts. They act, at least in part, by down-regulating Ihh signaling, Fgfr 3, and Runx 2 and by up-regulating Bmp 6. In conclusion, <b>Sox</b> 5 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 6 are needed for the establishment of multilayered growth plates, and thereby for proper and timely development of endochondral bones...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe myelin-forming oligodendrocytes are an {{excellent}} model to study transcriptional regulation of specification events, lineage progression, and terminal differentiation in the central nervous system. Here, we show that the group D Sox transcription factors <b>Sox</b> 5 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 6 jointly <b>and</b> cell-autonomously regulate several stages of oligodendrocyte development in the mouse spinal cord. They repress specification and terminal differentiation and influence migration patterns. As a consequence, oligodendrocyte precursors and terminally differentiating oligodendrocytes appear precociously in spinal cords deficient for both Sox proteins. <b>Sox</b> 5 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 6 have opposite functions than the group E Sox proteins <b>Sox</b> 9 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 10, which promote oligodendrocyte specification and terminal differentiation. Both genetic as well as molecular evidence suggests that <b>Sox</b> 5 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 6 directly interfere with the function of group E Sox proteins.

Nestin {{is also found in}} melanoma and we recently demonstrated that its expression in melanoma cell lines is regulated by the transcription factors <b>SOX</b> 9 <b>and</b> <b>SOX</b> 10, but not BRN 2. In this study, the expression levels of nestin, BRN 2, <b>SOX</b> 9 <b>and</b> <b>SOX</b> 10 were analysed in tissues of melanoma (n = 78) and melanocytic nevi (n = 26) by immunohistochemistry. All proteins were highly expressed in primary and metastatic melanomas and, apart from BRN 2, showed much lower levels in melanocytic nevi. Significant coexpression of nestin with <b>SOX</b> 9 <b>and</b> <b>SOX</b> 10 was found in primary melanoma confirming our in vitro data. Correlation analysis with clinicopathological data revealed that nestin was significantly associated with presence of ulceration in primary tumors <b>and</b> <b>SOX</b> 9 with more advanced stage of disease. Our data reveal that <b>SOX</b> 9 <b>and</b> <b>SOX</b> 10 are highly expressed in melanoma and seem to have a regulatory role in nestin expression.

40|$|The {{progression}} of neurogenesis relies on proneural basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) transcription factors. These factors operate in undifferentiated neural stem cells and induce cell cycle exit and {{the initiation of}} a neurogenic program. However, the transient expression of proneural bHLH proteins in neural progenitors indicates that expression of neuronal traits must rely on previously unexplored mechanisms operating downstream from proneural bHLH proteins. Here we show that the HMG-box transcription factors <b>Sox</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 11 are of critical importance, downstream from proneural bHLH proteins, {{for the establishment of}} pan-neuronal protein expression. Examination of a neuronal gene promoter reveals that <b>Sox</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 11 exert their functions as transcriptional activators. Interestingly, the capacity of <b>Sox</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 11 to induce the expression of neuronal traits is independent of mechanisms regulating the exit of neural progenitors from the cell cycle. The transcriptional repressor protein REST/NRSF has been demonstrated to block neuronal gene expression in undifferentiated neural cells. We now show that REST/NRSF restricts the expression of <b>Sox</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 11, explaining how REST/NRSF can prevent precocious expression of neuronal proteins.

40|$|Here, {{we explore}} whether {{silencing}} via promoter DNA methylation {{plays a role}} in neural versus neural crest cell lineage decisions.

DNMT 3 A is expressed in the neural plate border, and its knockdown causes ectopic <b>Sox</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 3 expression at the expense of neural crest markers. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation of neural folds demonstrates that DNMT 3 A specifically associates with CpG islands in the <b>Sox</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 3 promoter regions, resulting in their repression by methylation.

40|$|Sox 7, <b>Sox</b> 17 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 18 {{constitute}} group F of the Sox {{family of}} HMG box transcription factor genes. Dominant-negative mutations in Sox 18 underlie the cardiovascular defects observed in ragged mutant mice. By contrast, Sox 18 (-/-) mice are viable and fertile, and display no appreciable anomaly in their vasculature, suggesting functional compensation {{by the two}} other SoxF genes. Here, we provide direct evidence for redundant function of <b>Sox</b> 17 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 18 in postnatal neovascularization by generating Sox 17 (+/-) -Sox 18 (-/-) double mutant mice. Whereas <b>Sox</b> 18 (-/-) <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 17 (+/-) -Sox 18 (+/) -mice showed no vascular defects, {{approximately half of the}} Sox 17 (+/-) -Sox 18 (-/-) pups died before postnatal day 21 (P 21). They showed reduced neovascularization in the liver sinusoids and kidney outer medulla vasa recta at P 7, which most likely caused the ischemic necrosis observed by P 14 in hepatocytes and renal tubular epithelia. Those that survived to adulthood showed similar, but milder, vascular anomalies in both liver and kidney, and females were infertile with varying degrees of vascular abnormalities in the reproductive organs. These anomalies corresponded with sites of expression of <b>Sox</b> 7 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 17 in the developing postnatal vasculature. In vitro angiogenesis assays, using primary endothelial cells isolated from the P 7 livers, showed that the Sox 17 (+/-) -Sox 18 (-/-) endothelial cells were defective in endothelial sprouting and remodeling of the vasculature in a phenotype-dependent manner. Therefore, our findings indicate that <b>Sox</b> 17 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 18, <b>and</b> possibly all three SoxF genes, are cooperatively involved in mammalian vascular development...|$|R

40|$|The {{transcription}} factors <b>Sox</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 11 {{are important}} regulators of diverse developmental processes including heart, lung, pancreas, spleen, and B-cell development. Here we {{have studied the}} role of the related Sox 12 as the third protein of the SoxC group both in vivo and in vitro. Despite widespread Sox 12 expression during embryonic development, Sox 12 -deficient mice developed surprisingly normally, so that they were born alive, showed no gross phenotypic abnormalities, and were fertile in both sexes. Comparison with the related <b>Sox</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 11 revealed extensive overlap in the embryonic expression pattern but more uniform expression levels for Sox 12, without sites of particularly high expression. All three Sox proteins furthermore exhibited comparable DNA-binding characteristics and functioned as transcriptional activators. Sox 12 was, however, a relatively weak transactivator in comparison to Sox 11. We conclude that <b>Sox</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 11 function redundantly with <b>Sox</b> 12 <b>and</b> can compensate its loss during mouse development.

40|$|<b>Sox</b> 7 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 18 {{are members}} of the F-subgroup of Sox {{transcription}} factors family and are mostly expressed in endothelial compartments. In humans, dominant mutations in Sox 18 are the underlying cause of the severe hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia disorder characterized by vascular defects. However little is known about which vasculogenic processes <b>Sox</b> 7 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 18 regulate in vivo. We cloned the orthologs of <b>Sox</b> 7 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 18 in zebrafish, analysed their expression pattern and performed functional analyses. Both genes are expressed in the lateral plate mesoderm during somitogenesis. At later stages, Sox 18 is expressed in all axial vessels whereas Sox 7 expression is mainly restricted to the dorsal aorta. Knockdown of Sox 7 or Sox 18 alone failed to reveal any phenotype. In contrast, blocking the two genes simultaneously led to embryos displaying dysmorphogenesis of the proximal aorta and arteriovenous shunts, all of which can account for the lack of circulation observed in the trunk and tail. Gene expression analyses performed with general endothelial markers on double morphants revealed that <b>Sox</b> 7 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 18 are dispensable for the initial specification and positioning of the major trunk vessels. However, morphants display ectopic expression of the venous Flt 4 marker in the dorsal aorta and a concomitant reduction of the artery-specific markers EphrinB 2 a and Gridlock.

40|$|AbstractHere, we {{have studied}} how <b>Sox</b> genes <b>and</b> BMP {{signaling}} are functionally coupled during limb chondrogenesis. Using the experimental model of TGFβ 1 -induced interdigital digits, we dissect {{the sequence of}} morphological and molecular events during in vivo chondrogenesis. Our results show that <b>Sox</b> 8 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 9 are the most precocious markers of limb cartilage, and their induction is independent and precedes the activation of BMP signaling. Sox 10 appears also to cooperate with <b>Sox</b> 9 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 8 {{in the establishment of}} the digit cartilages. In addition, we show that experimental induction of Sox gene expression in the interdigital mesoderm is accompanied by loss of the apoptotic response to exogenous BMPs. L-Sox 5 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 6 are respectively induced coincident and after the expression of Bmpr 1 b in the prechondrogenic aggregate, and their activation correlates with the induction of Type II Collagen and Aggrecan genes in the differentiating cartilages. The expression of Bmpr 1 b precedes the appearance of morphological changes in the prechondrogenic aggregate and establishes a landmark from which the maintenance of the expression of all <b>Sox</b> genes <b>and</b> the progress of cartilage differentiation becomes dependent on BMPs. Moreover, we show that Ventroptin precedes Noggin in the modulation of BMP activity in the developing cartilages. In summary, our findings suggest that Sox 8, <b>Sox</b> 9, <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 10 have a cooperative function conferring chondrogenic competence to limb mesoderm in response to BMP signals. In turn, BMPs in concert with Sox 9, <b>Sox</b> 6, <b>and</b> L-Sox 5 would be responsible for the execution and maintenance of the cartilage differentiation program...|$|R

This way, we clustered Sox proteins according to their dimerization preferences illustrating that Sox HMG domains evolved different propensities to cooperate with Oct 4. Sox 2, Sox 14, <b>Sox</b> 21 <b>and</b> <b>Sox</b> 15 strongly cooperate on the canonical element but compete with Oct 4 on a recently discovered compressed element.
