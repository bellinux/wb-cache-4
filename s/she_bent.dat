As she sang, animated graphics of turntables, faders and other club equipment were projected behind Beyoncé, her dancers and musicians. Beyoncé was accompanied by her two drummers, two keyboardists, a percussionist, a horn section, three imposing backup vocalists called the Mamas and a lead guitarist, Bibi McGill. During the performance, <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> backwards at her guitarist's feet. Jonathon Moran of The Sunday Telegraph praised Beyoncé's dancing during the performance of the song on the I Am... World Tour. [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] was included as the fourth track on the deluxe edition of I Am... World Tour (2010).

2500|$|The first anthem was the Patriotic March, {{published}} on 15 November 1810 in the [...] It had lyrics by Esteban de Luca and music by Blas Parera. This original anthem made {{no reference to}} the name of Argentina (the country was not formally named [...] "República Argentina" [...] until 1826, although it {{was referred to as}} such) or an independentist will, and talked instead about Spain being conquered by France in the Peninsular War, the absolutist restoration begun by the Council of Regency, and the need to keep the republican freedoms achieved so far in the Americas: [...] "Spain was victim / of the plotting Gaul / because to the tyrants / <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> her neck / If there treachery / has doomed a thousands cities / let sacred freedom and union reign here / Let the father to the sons / be able to say / enjoy rights / that I did not enjoy".|$|E
2500|$|Ethan Mordden writes, [...] "It was {{a flawed}} voice. But then Callas sought to capture in her singing not just beauty but a whole humanity, and within her system, the flaws feed the feeling, the sour plangency and the strident {{defiance}} becoming {{aspects of the}} canto. They were literally defects of her voice; <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> them into advantages of her singing." [...] Giulini believes, [...] "If melodrama is the ideal unity of the trilogy of words, music, and action, {{it is impossible to}} imagine an artist in whom these three elements were more together than Callas." [...] He recalls that during Callas's performances of La traviata, [...] "reality was onstage. What stood behind me, the audience, auditorium, La Scala itself, seemed artifice. Only that which transpired on stage was truth, life itself." [...] Sir Rudolf Bing expressed similar sentiments:Once one heard and saw Maria Callas—one can't really distinguish it—in a part, {{it was very hard to}} enjoy any other artist, no matter how great, afterwards, because she imbued every part she sang and acted with such incredible personality and life. One move of her hand was more than another artist could do in a whole act.|$|E
