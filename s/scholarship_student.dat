5|$|Shulgin began {{studying}} organic chemistry as a Harvard University <b>scholarship</b> <b>student</b> {{at the age}} of 16. In 1943 he dropped out of school to join the U.S. Navy. While serving on USS Pope in the Navy during World War II, Shulgin was given a glass of orange juice by a nurse prior to surgery for a thumb infection. Shulgin drank the juice and, assuming that the powder {{at the bottom of the}} glass was a sedative, fell asleep rapidly. Upon waking he learned that the powder was undissolved sugar. The experience made him aware of the influence of placebos over the human mind.|$|E

25|$|Johann Mattheson, whose Grundlage einer Ehrenpforte (Hamburg, 1740) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} sources of information about Pachelbel's life, mentions that the young Pachelbel demonstrated exceptional musical and academic abilities. He received his primary education in St. Lorenz Hauptschule and the Auditorio Aegediano in Nuremberg, then on 29 June 1669 he became a student at the University of Altdorf, where he was also appointed organist of St. Lorenz church the same year. Financial difficulties forced Pachelbel to leave the university after less than a year. In order to complete his studies he became a <b>scholarship</b> <b>student,</b> in 1670, at the Gymnasium Poeticum at Regensburg. The school authorities were so impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications that he was admitted above the school's normal quota.|$|E

50|$|Charlotte School of Law offered {{conditional}} {{scholarships to}} certain incoming <b>students.</b> The <b>scholarships</b> required <b>students</b> {{to maintain a}} specific GPA rather than remain in good standing. Courses at Charlotte were graded on a curve with a low median GPA. Because conditional <b>scholarship</b> <b>students</b> were placed together in courses with strict grade curves, there was a risk that {{a large percentage of}} students would fail to maintain the required GPA to keep their scholarships. As a result, <b>scholarship</b> <b>students</b> lost their <b>scholarships</b> and were required to pay tuition to the school in subsequent semesters to continue their studies, allowing the school to increase revenues. During the 2015-2016 academic year, 155 out of 264 (59%) Charlotte School of Law <b>scholarship</b> <b>students</b> had their conditional scholarships reduced or eliminated.|$|R

Fast forward to a rainy night in 1933, when Gilda stumbles into the room of Guy Malyon, an Irishman who is a first-year <b>scholarship</b> <b>student</b> at Cambridge University. She has had a lover's quarrel with one of the dons, and rather than turn her out into the storm, Guy gallantly allows her to spend the night. Later, they become lovers, but the two are separated when Gilda's mother dies and she opts to leave England. A few years later, Guy sees her as an extra in a Hollywood film, and shortly after he coincidentally receives a letter from her inviting him to visit her in Paris, where she's working as a photographer.|$|E

2500|$|He {{published}} his third novel, I Am Charlotte Simmons (2004), chronicling {{the decline of}} a poor, bright <b>scholarship</b> <b>student</b> from Alleghany County, North Carolina, after attending an elite university. He conveys an institution filled with snobbery, materialism, anti-intellectualism, and sexual promiscuity. The novel met with a mostly tepid response by critics. Many social conservatives praised it {{in the belief that}} its portrayal revealed widespread moral decline. The novel won a Bad Sex in Fiction Award from the London-based Literary Review, a prize established [...] "to draw attention to the crude, tasteless, often perfunctory use of redundant passages of sexual description in the modern novel". [...] Wolfe later explained that such sexual references were deliberately clinical.|$|E

2500|$|Judt won a {{place at}} Emanuel School in Wandsworth, and {{following}} his education at Emanuel, {{he went on to}} study as a <b>scholarship</b> <b>student</b> at King's College, Cambridge. Judt was the first member of his family to finish secondary school and to go to university.

He obtained a BA degree in history in 1969 and after spending a year at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris completed a Ph.D. in 1972. As a high school and university student he was a left-wing Zionist, and worked summers on kibbutzim. He moved away from Zionism after the Six-Day War of 1967, later stating that [...] "I went with this idealistic fantasy of creating a socialist, communitarian country", but that he came to realise that left-wing Zionists were [...] "remarkably unconscious of the people who had been kicked out of the country...to make this fantasy possible". He came to describe his Zionism as his particular [...] "ideological overinvestment". Judt wrote in February 2010 that: [...] "Before even turning twenty I had become, been, and ceased to be a Zionist, a Marxist, and a communitarian settler: no mean achievement for a south London teenager".|$|E
2500|$|In a {{photograph}} posted on Instagram by Steubenville High football player Cody Saltsman, {{the victim was}} shown looking unresponsive, being carried by two teenage boys by her wrists and ankles. Former Steubenville baseball player Michael Nodianos, responding to hearsay of the event, tweeted [...] "Some people deserve to be peed on," [...] which was retweeted later by several people, including Mays. In a 12-minute video later posted to YouTube, Nodianos and others talk about the rapes, with Nodianos joking that [...] "they raped her quicker than Mike Tyson raped that one girl" [...] and [...] "They peed on her. That's how you know she's dead, because someone pissed on her." [...] While he did not sexually assault the victim himself, Nodianos, a <b>scholarship</b> <b>student</b> at Ohio State at the time news of the rape broke, received numerous threats for his comments, as did his family in Steubenville, and subsequently dropped out of school. In one text, Mays described the victim as [...] "like a dead body" [...] and [...] "deader than Caylee Anthony" [...] and in another he told the victim that a photo of her lying naked in a basement with semen on her body had been taken by him, and that the semen was his.
