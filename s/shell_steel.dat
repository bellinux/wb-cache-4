A numerical model of the composite PWFB, consisting of a plastic <b>shell,</b> <b>steel</b> frame, water and foam was developed and validated against results from full scale experimental tests. This model can be extended to larger scale impact cases, specifically ones that include actual vehicle models. The cost-benefit of having a validated numerical model is significant and this allows the road barrier designer to conduct extensive tests via numerical simulations prior to standard impact tests Effects of foam cladding as additional energy absorption material in the PWFB was investigated. Different types of foam were treated and it was found that XPS foam was the most suitable foam type. Results from this study will aid PWFB designers in developing new generation of roadside structures which will provide enhanced road safety...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{investigations}} have raised some {{doubts about the}} accuracy offlow theory predictions for a few plate and shell plastic buckling problems. The present series of buckling experiments on machined, mild steel, cylindrical shell models under non-proportional biaxial loading (axial tension plus external pressure) was designed to provide additional data {{for the evaluation of}} the J, plasticity theories. Numerical calculations were carried out with the BOSOR 5 shell buckling program, using the J, deformation andJlow theories, and these were compared with the test results. Neither theory can be said to predict plastic buckling accurately. However, deformation theory predicted the bifurcation buckling loads reasonably well, whereas $ow theory was often incorrect.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the behavior of}} hollow-core fiber-reinforced polymer–concrete–steel (HC-FCS) columns under cyclic torsional loading combined with constant axial load. The HC-FCS consists of an outer fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) tube and an inner steel tube, with a concrete shell sandwiched between the two tubes. The FRP tube was stopped at {{the surface of the}} footing, and provided confinement to the concrete shell from the outer direction. The steel tube was embedded into the footing to a length of 1. 8 times the diameter of the steel tube. The longitudinal and transversal reinforcements of the column were provided by the steel tube only. A large-scale HC-FCS column with a diameter of 24 in. (610 mm) and applied load height of 96 in. (2438 mm) with an aspect ratio of four was investigated during this study. The study revealed that the torsional behavior of the HC-FCS column mainly depended on the stiffness of the steel tube and the interactions among the column components (concrete <b>shell,</b> <b>steel</b> tube, and FRP tube). A brief comparison of torsional behavior was made between the conventional reinforced concrete columns and the HC-FCS column. The comparison illustrated that both column types showed high initial stiffness under torsional loading. However, the HC-FCS column maintained the torsion strength until a high twist angle, while the conventional reinforced concrete column did not...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{dissolution of}} titanium and vanadium in liquid steel has been studied. Two periods were distinguished: the <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> {{period and the}} free dissolution period. In the case of titanium, it is shown that the customary frozen <b>shell</b> of <b>steel</b> encases the cylinder following its initial immersion. Premature internal dissolution then begins {{as a result of}} liquid eutectic of Fe(, 0. 3) Ti(, 0. 7) composition forming at the inner <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> boundary. This phenomenon triggers an exothermic dissolution and erosion of the inner <b>steel</b> <b>shell.</b> The net result is considerable shortened shell melting times. During the free dissolution period, the temperature of the titanium dissolving at the interface increases and the dissolution process becomes self-accelerating. During the <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> period with pure vanadium and ferrovanadium alloys, no reaction was observed between the <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> and vanadium. For low grade ferrovanadium alloys, the dissolution proceeds via a heat transfer mechanism. On the other hand, for high grades, ferrovanadium mass transfer mechanisms dominate. A simplified mathematical model of the process has been developed to describe the coupled heat and mass transfer phenomena involved in the various systems studied...|$|R

There was a reproducible trend in net residual shell distortion as a function of temperature with residual tensile stresses in the shell for temperatures ≤ 210 °C and ≥ 390 °C, and net compressive stresses at intermediate temperatures. In-situ linear displacement sensor experiments have been used to investigate the dynamic distortion of sprayed <b>steel</b> <b>shells</b> on <b>steel</b> substrates, over the same range of surface temperatures.

It is proposed that tensile quench stresses are balanced by the time- and temperature-dependent expansive austenite-to-bainite phase transformation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{carrying}} capacity and energy absorption characteristic of foamed aluminum (or aluminum foam), fabricated by melt foaming technique, are limited {{due to the}} lower strength of aluminum. The typical anti-vibration energy absorbing structures are designed as foamed aluminum-filled or sandwich structures. The deformation and absorption characteristics of foamed aluminum-filled structures subjected to impact loadings are analyzed using experimental and numerical methods in this work. The analysis shows that the <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> of the combinative structure subjected to dynamic loadings dominates during energy absorption. The energy absorption capacity and initial instability loading increase as impact velocity increase and as increasing shell thickness duo to the interaction between <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> and aluminum foam. The impact mass {{within the range of}} 100 kg influences weakly on peak instability loading. Since the <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> is the dominating part of load capacity and energy absorption, the reasonable design, taking into account of foam density and shell thickness and taking full advantage of interaction between <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> and aluminum foam, should be adopted to increase the energy absorption characteristic of foam-filled structures...|$|R

40|$|A {{model for}} the {{formation}} of oscillation marks in continuous casting of steel will be derived and evalu-ated numerically. Liquid steel is injected through a submerged nozzle into an intensively cooled mould. At the wall the steel solidifies and the solidified shell is withdrawn vertically. Flux powder is added at the top of liquid steel. It melts (slag) and thus it serves as a lubricant for the passage of the <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> through the mould. In order to prevent sticking of the steel onto the mould it oscillates vertically leaving oscillation marks {{on the surface of the}} solidified <b>steel</b> <b>shell.</b> In the present study the interaction of the steel melt, the solidified <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> and the slag will be inves-tigated. On the basis of thin layer approximations for the slag flow and heat transfer through the <b>steel</b> <b>shell,</b> slag and mould, respectively, and dominating surface tension at the interface liquid steel/liquid slag a mathematical model will be derived, solved numerically and compared with data reported in the literature. The flow problem for the slag flow is closely related to the well known coating problem...|$|R

40|$|The {{dissolution}} of Ti additions in liquid steel during secondary steelmaking {{occurs in a}} two step process. In the first step, a <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> solidifies around the initial cold addition, whereas in the second step, after this shell has remelted, the Ti dissolves directly in the steel bath. The initial presence of this <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> modifies the position of dissolution and influences the local concentration and thus the inclusion formation. Further complications arise {{from the fact that}} part of the Ti will dissolve while enclosed by the <b>steel</b> <b>shell,</b> altering the alloy composition first released in the ladle and effectively shortening the subsequent free dissolution period. The duration of the <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> period and the fraction of predissolved Ti have been investigated using a conservative one-dimensional sharp interface model solving the coupled heat and mass transfer in a cylindrical shell/addition composite. The influence of the convection conditions and the original Ti radius was evaluated in a parametric study. A pronounced effect of the convective heat transfer on the shell melting time was found. It is thus concluded that the dissolution behaviour is strongly dependent on the local flow conditions, which is determined by factors such as stirring conditions and addition characteristics. status: publishe...|$|R
