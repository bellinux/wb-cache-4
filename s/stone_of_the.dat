5|$|Dodd {{submitted}} a scheme for a bridge at Vauxhall of 13 arches. However, {{soon after the}} 1809 Act was passed, he was dismissed by the Vauxhall Bridge Company and his design was abandoned. John Rennie was commissioned to design and build the new bridge, and a stone bridge of seven arches was approved. On 9 May 1811, Lord Dundas laid the foundation <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge on the northern bank.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{has been}} a focus of Mexican {{cultural}} identity, and {{is a testament to}} its colonial history. Researcher Manuel Rivera Cambas reported that the cathedral was built on the site sacred precinct of the Aztecs and with the very stones of their temples so that the Spaniards could lay claim to the land and the people. Hernán Cortés supposedly laid the first <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original church personally.|$|E

5|$|The {{high volume}} of {{visitors}} ascending the Borobudur's narrow stairs, {{has caused a}} severe wear out on the <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stairs, eroding the stones surface and made them thinner and smoother. Overall, Borobudur has 2,033 surfaces of stone stairs, spread over four cardinal directions; including the west side, the east, south and north. There are around 1,028 surfaces of them, or about 49.15 percent are severely worn out.|$|E
5|$|After the {{construction}} was complete {{there was no}} further room for expansion at Les Corts. Back-to-back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 and the signing of László Kubala in June 1950, who would later go on to score 196 goals in 256 matches, drew larger crowds to the games. The club began to make {{plans for a new}} stadium. The building of Camp Nou commenced on 28 March 1954, before a crowd of 60,000 Barça fans. The first <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> future stadium was laid in place under the auspices of Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego. Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288 million pesetas, 336% over budget.|$|E

He is {{attacked}} on the way by the shadow, which destroys his staff, but Ged escapes into the Court of Terrenon. Serret, {{the lady of the}} castle, shows him the stone of Terrenon, and tempts Ged to speak to it, claiming it can give him limitless knowledge and power. Believing the stone harbors an evil spirit, Ged refuses. Realizing that the servants of the stone wish to enslave him, he flees. He is pursued by the stone's minions but transforms into a falcon and flies away.|$|E

5|$|Chetro Ketl's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} using three bulk materials: stone, clay-sand, and water. Two types of stone were used: a hard gray-brown tabular sandstone {{that forms the}} bench above Chaco Canyon's cliffs, and a softer, tan, massively bedded sandstone that forms the cliffs themselves. Chacoans preferred the harder, tabular stone as {{it was easier to}} shape, but much of it had to be dug up and levered out of the ground with wooden poles. Because the massive tan <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cliff faces was easier to procure, but much more difficult to work, the Chacoans probably used it only after the more easily quarried gray-brown stone beds had been depleted.|$|E
5|$|Durham's {{location}} in the north left it insecure, as Malcolm Canmore, King of Scots, raided and invaded the north of England {{on a number of}} occasions. Malcolm claimed Northumbria, in which Durham was located, as part of his kingdom. St-Calais managed to befriend Malcolm, and secured his support for the patron saint of Durham, Saint Cuthbert. Malcolm and his wife helped lay the foundation <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new cathedral dedicated to Cuthbert. Respect for the saint did not mean that Malcolm refrained entirely from raiding the north; he was killed in 1093 while once more raiding Northumbria. Both the English king and St-Calais did all in their power to support Malcolm's sons, who had been educated in England, in their attempts to secure the Scottish throne.|$|E

Eventually she became just as busy as queen mother as she had been as queen consort. In July 1953, she undertook her first overseas visit since the funeral when she visited the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland with Princess Margaret. She laid the foundation <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland – the current University of Zimbabwe.|$|E

5|$|The Foundation <b>Stone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Monument to the Early Founders of Singapore, {{usually called}} the Early Founders Memorial Stone is a {{national}} memorial that {{is dedicated to the}} early founders ("Unknown Immigrants") of Singapore. The original idea was raised by a graduates' association and an open design competition was held for the memorial project. The foundation stone was initially erected along Collyer Quay Street outside the Fullerton Hotel in 1970. After a series of setbacks and delays, the project was finally scrapped after no worthy design was accepted, which resulted the foundation stone becoming the memorial afterwards. In 2000, the memorial was relocated to the National Archives of Singapore at Canning Rise before moving back to the grounds of The Fullerton Hotel in 2010.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the 21st century it became evident that the soft <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cenotaph was deteriorating badly as a result of water damage and frost. Recutting the names on the {{monument}} was discounted as a solution due to the long term damage this repeated work would cause to the Cenotaph's structure: {{the decision was made to}} expand the war memorial instead. A glass wall consisting of eight large panels 2.85m (9ft) by 1.2m (4ft) in size, was built alongside the Cenotaph at a cost of £130,000. The panels were engraved with the names of the World War I casualties and, in addition, those from Southampton who had died in later conflicts. The Memorial Wall included a total of 2,368 names from the First World War, 927 from the Second World War and three from subsequent conflicts. This addition to the Cenotaph was opened on 11 December 2011.|$|E
5|$|In 1565, the Ottomans {{attacked}} {{again in}} the Great Siege of Malta. Fort Saint Elmo fell after fierce fighting (in which the Ottoman general Dragut Reis was killed), but the knights held out in Birgu and Senglea until a relief force arrived. By {{the end of the}} siege, most of the fortifications had been destroyed in the attacks, so they were rebuilt. The Grand Master, Jean Parisot de Valette, decided to build a new fortified capital on the Sciberras Peninsula. The first <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new city was laid down in 1566, and it was called Valletta. The city walls, which were constructed mainly in the 1560s and 1570s, remain largely intact to this day, and they include bastions, cavaliers, counterguards and a ditch. The ruined Fort Saint Elmo was rebuilt and integrated into the city walls. The area around St Elmo was strengthened a number of times later on in the 17th century, especially by the building of the Carafa Enceinte in 1687.|$|E

5|$|In 1827, {{the church}} erected a {{building}} dedicated as a Sunday school. This {{was also used}} as a day school from 1838. In 1906, around 250 children attended the Sunday school and the church had numerous affiliated groups, such as a Penny Bank and a Choral Society. The day school accommodation {{was at that time}} condemned by the Board of Education as unfit for purpose and it was operating under a stay issued by the board. In the same year, Hannah Mitchell, a suffragette, was arrested at the day school for protesting during an election campaign speech by Winston Churchill. The building was closed in 1908 and a new school building opened on Gartside Street in 1910 at a cost of £4000. This new facility was used only as Sunday school because, said the local clergy, the Board of Education put too many administrative obstacles and demands in their way, such as stipulating such a small attendance roll as to render any day school uneconomic and insisting on a dedicated playground despite there being a large open space next door that was traditionally used for that purpose. According to the foundation <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new school building, the church had operated the first Sunday school in Manchester, although Shaw attributes that distinction to a Mr Fildes, a Methodist whose establishment began operating from a Travis Street cellar in 1782. Shaw says that several other schools preceded that of St John's.|$|E
5|$|Paralympic {{wheelchair}} curling {{is played}} {{according to the}} rules of the World Curling Federation, the only modification {{is that there is no}} sweeping. The sport was open to both male and female athletes who competed in mixed teams, with a requirement that each team had at least one member of each sex. The format was a round-robin tournament; each nation played all others in a group stage with the top four qualifying for medal playoffs. Britain won their group games against the teams from Denmark, Sweden, Italy and the United States, and lost the matches against Switzerland, Norway and Canada. Their record of four wins and three loses meant they finished the group stage in second place and advanced directly to the medal rounds. In the first end of the semi-final, against Sweden, Britain stole three and went on to win the match 7–3. In the final the team faced Canada. Trailing 6–3 in the final end skip Frank Duffy had an opportunity, with the last <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tournament for an open hit of a Canadian stone. If successful he would have scored four for Britain and won them the gold medal but he threw too hard and the shot tracked an inch wide. This meant that Canada scored one to win 7–4, leaving the British team as silver medallists.|$|E
5|$|With {{the rapid}} {{advances}} in theatre technology made during this period, the 1868 theatre quickly became outmoded, and the sub-lease of the theatre, still {{held by the}} Dudley family, was due to expire in 1891. The Commissioners of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues (forerunners of the Crown Estate) desired the entire block on which the theatre stood to be rebuilt, except for the Royal Arcade, where the lease did not expire until 1912. Problems were encountered in obtaining all the buildings and in financing the scheme, but the theatre and surrounding buildings were demolished in 1892. Plans were commissioned from architect Charles J. Phipps for a theatre and a hotel. In February 1896 an agreement was reached with Herbert Beerbohm Tree for the erection of the theatre {{at a cost of}} £55,000. The plans were approved in February 1897, and on 16 July 1896, the foundation <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new theatre was laid. Phipps died in 1897, and the theatre was his last work.|$|E
