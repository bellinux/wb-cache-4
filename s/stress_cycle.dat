Some of this inelastic deformation energy is dissipated as heat within the polymer, and consequently the materials temperature will rise {{as a function}} of frequency, testing temperature, the <b>stress</b> <b>cycle</b> and the type of polymer. As the temperature within the polymer rises, the stiffness and yield strength will fall, and thermal failure becomes a possibility as deformation levels become excessive.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{its high}} initial strength-to-weight ratio, a design {{limitation}} of CFRP is {{its lack of}} a definable fatigue endurance limit. This means, theoretically, that <b>stress</b> <b>cycle</b> failure cannot be ruled out. While steel and many other structural metals and alloys do have estimable fatigue endurance limits, the complex failure modes of composites mean that the fatigue failure properties of CFRP are difficult to predict and design for. As a result, when using CFRP for critical cyclic-loading applications, engineers may need to design in considerable strength safety margins to provide suitable component reliability over its service life.|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of component fatigue lifetime for a wind {{energy conversion system}} (WECS) requires that the component load spectrum be formulated in terms of <b>stress</b> <b>cycles.</b> Typically, these <b>stress</b> <b>cycles</b> are obtained from time series data using a cycle identification scheme. As discussed by many authors, the matrix or matrices of cycle counts that describe the stresses on a turbine are constructed from relatively short, representative samples of time series data. The ability to correctly represent the long-term behavior {{of the distribution of}} <b>stress</b> <b>cycles</b> from these representative samples is critical to the {{analysis of}} service lifetimes. Several techniques are currently used to convert representative samples to the lifetime cyclic loads on the turbine.

Fitting techniques are now incorporated into the LIFE 2 fatigue/fracture analysis code for wind turbines.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we report}} the {{characterization}} of springback degradation of an Invar sheet {{with a combination of}} gamma-ray irradiation and repeated hot-then-cold stresses. The springback factor value of fresh Invar without radiation shows a linear increase with the number of hot-then-cold <b>stress</b> <b>cycles.</b> Continuous springback degradations are observed as the number of hot-then-cold <b>stress</b> <b>cycles</b> reaches 100. When the Invar sheet is subjected to gamma-ray irradiation, the springback factor is greater than that of the repeated hot-then-cold stressed samples. After applying the repeated hot-then-cold stresses to the post-irradiated Invar sheets, the springback factors are first restored to the value of fresh Invar, and then revert to an increasing trend. Our previous X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis excluded the crystalline structural changes in the post-irradiated Invar. It is believed that the radiation-induced defects, which are closely related to the springback degradation, are possibly annealed during the first 20 hot-then-cold <b>stress</b> <b>cycles.</b> These cycles ultimately dominate the springback behavior of the stressed Invar sheets...|$|R

40|$|Summary Effects {{of water}} deficits on leaf turgor mainte-nance {{processes}} were analyzed for pear trees (Pyrus communis L. cv. ‘‘Barlett’’) grown in 120 -liter containers. Four irrigation treatments were applied: a well-watered control treatment, a spring water <b>stress</b> <b>cycle</b> (Sp), a summer water <b>stress</b> <b>cycle</b> (Su), and a spring plus summer water <b>stress</b> <b>cycle</b> (Sp + Su). For the Sp treatment, water application was progressively reduced from 100 to 20 % {{of the control}} dose {{over a period of}} 27 days in spring. For the Su treatment, water application was progres-sively reduced over 23 days in summer, from 100 to 20 % of the control dose. The Sp + Su treatment comprised both the spring and summer drought stress cycles. Pressure [...] volume (P [...] V) curves were constructed and stomatal conductances were de-termined for pear leaves from each treatment during the spring and summer stress cycles. Leaf water potential (Yp 0) and rela-tive water content (R 0) at the turgor loss point of control leaves tended to decrease from spring to summer. Changes in leaf osmotic water potential at full turgor (Yp 100) and in symplast water fraction (Rs) did not explain the seasonal decrease in Yp 0. The water stress treatments had no effect on Yp 100, but Rs was reduced by the water stress treatments, particularly during the summer <b>stress</b> <b>cycle</b> of the Su and Sp + Su treatments. The decrease in Rs was correlated with an increase in the slope of the linear region of the P [...] V curve. Such a coupled adjustment would lead to increased water uptake capacity of water-stressed trees only under non-turgor conditions. Furthermore, pear leaves did not actively accumulate solutes. We conclude, there-fore, that changes in leaf tissue water relations as a result of leaf acclimation to water stress are unlikely to facilitate main-tenance of fruit productivity under drought...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} effects of N nutrition and water stress on stomatal behavior and CO 2 exchange rate in wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv Olaf). Wheat plants were grown hydroponically with high (100 milligrams per liter) and low (10 milligrams per liter) N. When plants were 38 days old, a 24 -day water <b>stress</b> <b>cycle</b> was begun. A gradual increase in nutrient solution osmotic pressure from 0. 03 to 1. 95 mega Pascals was achieved by incremental additions of PEG- 6, 000. Plants in both N treatments adjusted osmotically, although leaf water potential was consistently lower and relative water content greater for low N plants in the first half of the <b>stress</b> <b>cycle.</b> Leaf conductance of high N plants appeared greater than that of low N plants at high water potentials, but showed greater sensitivity to reductions in water potential as indicated by earlier stomatal closure during the <b>stress</b> <b>cycle.</b> The apparent greater stomatal sensitivity of high N plants was associated with a curvilinear relationship between leaf conductance and leaf water potential; low N plants exhibited more of a threshold response. Trends in [CO 2]INT throughout the <b>stress</b> <b>cycle</b> indicated nonstomatal effects of water stress on CO 2 exchange rate were greater in high N plants. Although estimates of [CO 2]INT were generally lower in high N plants, they were relatively insensitive to leaf water potential-induced changes in leaf conductance. In contrast, [CO 2]INT of low N plants dropped concomitantly with leaf conductance at low leaf water potentials. Oxygen response of CO 2 exchange rate for both treatments was affected less by reductions in water potential than was CO 2 exchange rate at 2. 5 % O 2, suggesting that CO 2 assimilation capacity of the leaves was affected more by reductions in leaf water potential than were processes related to photorespiration...|$|E
