5|$|Written by Robin Squire, this four-part <b>story</b> <b>had</b> a scene {{breakdown}} commissioned on 5 January 1983 and {{the scripts}} on 20 May 1983.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} seen by 7.35 million viewers in the UK and {{achieved}} an Appreciation Index of 85. Reviewers were generally positive about the episode; some praised the setting and characters but others commented that the <b>story</b> <b>had</b> not developed enough {{even though it was}} only the first part. The computer-generated effects used for one scene were also disapproved of by a couple of reviewers.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} piracy cropped up when a news article {{published}} in The Indian Express exposed {{the dark side of}} the film market. Hardly into weeks of the film's release, CDs were being sold at as low as Rs. 40. Another blemish was that Soumitra Dasgupta, a writer and close associate of Sarkar alleged that the film's <b>story</b> <b>had</b> a striking resemblance to his parallel work on the novella.|$|E
50|$|Her <b>stories</b> <b>have</b> been {{included}} in anthologies and a few have had radio and television adaptations. One collection of her <b>stories</b> <b>has</b> been published.|$|R
50|$|Naveen’s short <b>stories</b> <b>have</b> {{appeared}} in five collections — Life in a College, Enimido Adugu (Eighth Step), From Anuradha with Love, Nishkriti (Deliverance) and Bandhitulu (The Enslaved). Apart from winning prizes {{many of his}} <b>stories</b> <b>have</b> also been translated into Hindi, English, Tamil, Kannada, Sanskrit and Marathi. A collection of his short <b>stories</b> <b>has</b> also {{appeared in}} English translation under the title Lifescapes.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>story</b> <b>has</b> simple {{rectangular}} fenestration; {{the windows}} of the second through seventh <b>stories</b> <b>have</b> flat-arched lintels with triple keystones (some have end voussoirs), except for the second-story corner windows above the entrance porticoes which have molded surrounds with cartouche keystones. The top <b>story</b> <b>has</b> round-arched windows with keystones and is capped by a copper cornice with egg-and-dart and patterned motif moldings.|$|R
5|$|The second, G.I. Joe and the Transformers, was a 4-issue mini-series {{running from}} January to April 1987. The <b>story</b> <b>had</b> the Joes and the Autobots joining forces {{to stop the}} Decepticons and Cobra from {{destroying}} the world. A trade paperback later collected all four issues.|$|E
5|$|While {{the show}} was still in previews, writer Owen Davis claimed the <b>story</b> <b>had</b> been lifted from his earlier play Lola, which had {{appeared}} briefly on Broadway in March 1911, then was adapted as a movie in 1914. He filed a lawsuit, {{but by the end}} of May it was settled with a cash payment to Davis.|$|E
5|$|Work on Siti Akbari was {{completed}} {{over a period}} of several years. Lie stated that the <b>story</b> <b>had</b> taken him three years, writing sporadically. Tio, however, reports rumours that the writing took some seven years, with Lie sometimes taking long breaks and sometimes writing in a fervor, writing from dawn until dusk.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to these collections, many of Bradburys short <b>stories</b> <b>have</b> been published in multi-author anthologies. Almost fifty additional Bradbury <b>stories</b> <b>have</b> never been collected anywhere after their initial publication in periodicals.|$|R

5|$|An EastEnders {{spokesperson}} {{stated that}} programme-makers {{were working in}} close conjunction with the NSPCC in order to portray the subject matter accurately and sensitively, commenting that the show aims {{to raise awareness of}} real-life issues, and has in the past similarly drawn attention to issues such as domestic violence, rape and HIV. John Grounds, the NSPCC's director of communications, praised the soap for raising awareness of the issue. Sara Nathan of The Sun reported that the <b>story</b> <b>had</b> been planned since the previous year, and would begin with Whitney worrying about Tony's release from prison and the effect it would have on her family.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1877, Rimsky-Korsakov thought {{increasingly}} {{about the}} short story May Night by Nikolai Gogol. The <b>story</b> <b>had</b> long been a favorite of his, and his wife Nadezhda had encouraged him to write an opera based on it from the day of their betrothal, when they had read it together. While musical ideas for such a work predated 1877, now they came with greater persistence. By early 1878 the project took an increasing amount of his attention; in February he started writing in earnest, and he finished the opera by early November.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1951 Donen made Love Is Better Than Ever. The film stars Larry Parks, whose Oscar–nominated {{performance}} in The Jolson <b>Story</b> <b>had</b> {{made him a}} star five years earlier. Parks plays a streetwise show business agent who finds himself compelled to marry an innocent young dance teacher played by Elizabeth Taylor. Donen and Kelly appear in cameo roles. The film remained unreleased {{for over a year}} after Parks admitted to the House Un-American Activities Committee that he {{had been a member of}} the Communist Party and named other members. The film was unsuccessful at the box office.|$|E
5000|$|The whole <b>story</b> <b>has</b> been modernised. It {{now takes}} place in the 1990s. Due to that fact, many aspects of the {{original}} <b>story</b> <b>have</b> been changed. Here are some of the important differences: ...|$|R
5000|$|Kennedy's <b>stories</b> <b>have</b> been {{praised for}} being [...] "well-written and swooningly romantic" [...] {{containing}} relationships which are [...] "gripping and realistic." [...] Her <b>stories</b> <b>have</b> also been praised for their [...] "depth of worldbuilding." ...|$|R
50|$|He is now as much {{known as}} a fiction writer as a poet, and his {{collection}} of short <b>stories</b> <b>has</b> been awarded the prestigious Sarala Award. Many of his short <b>stories</b> <b>have</b> been produced as television films.|$|R
5|$|Lonesome Road: In Lonesome Road, the Courier is {{contacted}} by Ulysses, an ex-legionary and courier who, upon seeing the Courier's {{name on a}} list of possible deliverers, refused to deliver the Platinum Chip that was ultimately responsible for the Courier's attempted murder. Ulysses was a character whose involvement in the <b>story</b> <b>had</b> been hinted since New Vegas' initial release, and Lonesome Road concludes his story, {{as well as that of}} the Courier. Initially, Lonesome Road was planned to be released in August 2011; however, the add-on was delayed until September 20 for unspecified reasons.|$|E
5|$|Madness in the Fast Lane is the BBC documentary, first {{broadcast}} on BBC One on 10 August 2010, which brought {{the story of}} Sabina and Ursula Eriksson and the killing of Glen Hollinshead into the public consciousness. The footage on the M6 motorway of the two women jumping into the passing traffic had previously been {{broadcast on}} Motorway Cops, {{but this was the}} first time the rest of the <b>story</b> <b>had</b> been told.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{others have}} been {{referenced}} in dialogue. Several former companions of the Doctor are referenced in the story Death of the Doctor, and the episode also includes brief on-screen flashbacks showing the Third, Fourth and Tenth Doctors. Companion Harry Sullivan is referenced separately in dialogue on several occasions and {{a photograph of the}} character is visible in one episode. In an issue of Doctor Who Magazine, Sophie Aldred was read an email from Russell T. Davies, in which he declared his plans to bring Ace into a <b>story</b> <b>had</b> the show continued. The episode Sky was originally to have featured the Eleventh Doctor, but Matt Smith was not available.|$|E
50|$|As the {{subtitle}} suggests, each story focuses on music and musicians, and {{the close of}} day. All of the <b>stories</b> <b>have</b> unfulfilled potential as a linking theme, tinged with elements of regret. The second and fourth <b>stories</b> <b>have</b> comic undertones. The first and final stories feature cafe musicians, and the first and fourth stories feature the same character. All five <b>stories</b> <b>have</b> unreliable male narrators and are written in the first person.|$|R
50|$|He {{works as}} a {{lecturer}} in a college at Navsari, Gujarat. Many of his <b>stories</b> <b>have</b> been translated into English by Sachin Ketkar and Hemang Desai. The translations of his <b>stories</b> <b>have</b> appeared in Indian Literature and New Quest.|$|R

5|$|On February 27, 2008, {{allegations}} surfaced {{that two}} Conservative Party officials offered terminally ill, Independent MP Chuck Cadman a million-dollar {{life insurance policy}} {{in exchange for his}} vote to bring down the Liberal government in a May 2005, budget vote. If the <b>story</b> <b>had</b> been proved true, the actions may have been grounds for charges as a criminal offence since, under the Criminal Code of Canada, it is illegal to bribe an MP.|$|E
5|$|Toy <b>Story</b> <b>had</b> a large {{promotion}} {{before its}} release, leading to numerous tie-ins {{with the film}} including images on food packaging. A variety of merchandise was released during the film's theatrical run and its initial VHS release including toys, clothing, and shoes, among other things. When an action figure for Buzz Lightyear and Sheriff Woody was created it was initially ignored by retailers. However, after over 250,000 figures were sold for each character before the film's release, demand continued to expand, eventually reaching over 25million units sold by 2007.|$|E
5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The <b>story</b> <b>had</b> changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E
50|$|The <b>story</b> <b>has</b> many roots.|$|R
50|$|The <b>story</b> <b>has</b> {{been deemed}} Jamesian.|$|R
50|$|The story {{appears in}} The Newgate Calendar, a crime {{catalogue}} of Newgate Prison in London. While historians {{tend to believe}} Bean never existed or his <b>story</b> <b>has</b> been greatly exaggerated, his <b>story</b> <b>has</b> passed into local folklore and {{become part of the}} Edinburgh tourism industry.|$|R
5|$|An early 1970s Spider-Man story {{led to the}} {{revision}} of the Comics Code. Previously, the Code forbade the depiction {{of the use of}} illegal drugs, even negatively. However, in 1970, the Nixon administration's Department of Health, Education, and Welfare asked Stan Lee to publish an anti-drug message in one of Marvel's top-selling titles. Lee chose the top-selling The Amazing Spider-Man; issues #96–98 (May–July 1971) feature a story arc depicting the negative effects of drug use. In the story, Peter Parker's friend Harry Osborn becomes addicted to pills. When Spider-Man fights the Green Goblin (Norman Osborn, Harry's father), Spider-Man defeats the Green Goblin, by revealing Harry's drug addiction. While the <b>story</b> <b>had</b> a clear anti-drug message, the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval. Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority's approval or seal. The issues sold so well that the industry's self-censorship was undercut and the Code was subsequently revised.|$|E
5|$|Apollo Justice was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} 28 staff members. It was produced by Minae Matsukawa and directed by Mitsuru Endo, with character design and art by Kazuya Nuri, while series creator Shu Takumi wrote the game's scenario and took on a supervisory role. Takumi had wanted the series to end with the previous game, as he felt its main character, Phoenix Wright, had been fully explored and that his <b>story</b> <b>had</b> been told; he said {{that it is important to}} know when to end a story, that he did not want the series to become a shadow of its former self, and that he did not see any reason to continue it. When it was still decided that a fourth game would be made, Takumi wanted it to have a new main character and a new story; he did not plan to have Phoenix appear in the game, but his colleagues wanted him in the game in some form, which led to him being the accused in the first case in the game.|$|E
5|$|Further {{support for}} the {{association}} between autism and thiomersal appeared in an article by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. in the magazines Rolling Stone and Salon.com alleging a government conspiracy at a CDC meeting to conceal the dangers of thiomersal to protect the pharmaceutical industry, and a book written by David Kirby, Evidence of Harm, dramatizing the lives of parents of autistic children, with both authors participating in media interviews to promote their work and the controversy. Although the allegations by Kennedy were denied and a US Senate committee investigation later found no evidence to substantiate the most serious allegations, the <b>story</b> <b>had</b> already been well publicized by leveraging Kennedy's celebrity. Salon magazine subsequently amended Kennedy's article five times due to factual errors and later retracted it completely on January 16, 2011, stating that the works of critics of the article and evidence of the flaws in the science connecting autism and vaccines undermined {{the value of the}} article to the editors.|$|E
