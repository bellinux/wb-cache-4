5|$|In May 1957, the Egyptologist Margaret Murray {{involved}} {{herself in}} the Gogmagog debate, championing Lethbridge's ideas against the academic fraternity in a letter she sent to The Times. W.

5|$|Bacon: A Love Story, A Salty Survey of Everybody's Favorite Meat is a 2009 non-fiction {{book about}} bacon, written by American writer Heather Lauer. Lauer started the blog Bacon Unwrapped {{and a social}} {{networking}} site about bacon in 2005, after the idea came to her while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> drinking with her two brothers; her online success inspired her to write the book, which describes curing and cooking bacon, gives over 20 bacon recipes, and analyzes the impact of bacon on popular culture. The text is interspersed with facts about bacon and bacon-related quips from comedian Jim Gaffigan.|$|E

5|$|Endeavour then resumed her voyage westward {{along the}} coast, picking {{a path through}} {{intermittent}} shoals and reefs {{with the help of}} the pinnace, which was rowed ahead to test the water depth. By 26 August <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of sight of land, and had entered the open waters of the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, earlier navigated by Luis Váez de Torres in 1606. To keep Endeavours voyages and discoveries secret, Cook confiscated the log books and journals of all on board and ordered them to remain silent about where they had been.|$|E
5|$|The damage inflicted {{during the}} attack was not {{sufficient}} to sink or disable Tirpitz, but she suffered considerable damage to her superstructure and unarmored areas, with 122 members of her crew killed and 316 were wounded. The German Kriegsmarine decided to repair the battleship, and works were completed by mid-July. The British conducted further carrier raids against Tirpitz between April and August 1944 {{in the hope of}} prolonging the period <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of service, but none was successful. Tirpitz was eventually disabled and then sunk by Royal Air Force heavy bombers in late 1944.|$|E
5|$|While <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of {{commission}} at Mare Island, Bennington was refitted. A pilothouse {{that had been}} added {{on top of her}} bridge and a spotlight platform on her bow – both added in 1893–94 – were removed. Benningtons mainmast was also removed, leaving her as a two-mast rig. In addition, two tall ventilation cowls were added immediately behind the bridge. After 18months of inactivity, Bennington was recommissioned on 2 March 1903 under the command of Commander Chauncey Thomas.|$|E

5|$|By early April, Michigan {{was back}} in service; {{for the next several}} months, she {{primarily}} trained gunners in the Chesapeake Bay. While on a convoy escort that had left the United States on 30 September, the ship's port screw fell off. She was forced to leave the convoy on 8 October and return to port for repairs. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of service {{for the rest of the}} war. In November 1918, Germany signed the Armistice that ended the fighting in Europe. Michigan was assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force in late December 1918 to ferry American soldiers back from Europe. She made two round trips in 1919 during the operation, the first from 18 January to 3 March, and the second from 18 March to 16 April. She brought back 1,062 men between the two voyages.|$|E
5|$|Potter {{had become}} tired of writing for {{children}} and increasingly unfamiliar with them. The Moore children (for whom she had written several tales early in her career) were grown, and Potter had not replaced them with other children, although she continued to write letters to child fans who had written her. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> {{of touch with the}} interests of American children. Her marriage to William Heelis on October 15, 1913 effectively ended her literary and artistic career. Although she published sporadically in the years following her marriage, her works depended principally upon decades-old concepts filed away in her publisher's offices and ageing illustrations tucked away in her portfolio. Only The Tale of Johnny Town-Mouse (1918) brought forth a completely new set of illustrations from the artist. She devoted herself to marriage and farming, and avoided publicity and fans.|$|E
5|$|The battle finally ceased when a shell from Virginia {{struck the}} pilot house of Monitor and exploded, driving {{fragments}} {{of paint and}} iron through the viewing slits into Worden's eyes and temporarily blinding him. As {{no one else could}} see to command the ship, Monitor was forced to draw off. The executive officer, Lieutenant Samuel Dana Greene, took over, and Monitor returned to the fight. In the period of command confusion, however, the crew of Virginia believed that their opponent had withdrawn. Although Minnesota was still aground, the falling tide meant that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of reach. Furthermore, Virginia had suffered enough damage to require extensive repair. Convinced that his ship had won the day, Jones ordered her back to Norfolk. At about this time, Monitor returned, only to discover her opponent apparently giving up the fight. Convinced that Virginia was quitting, with orders only to protect Minnesota and not to risk his ship unnecessarily, Greene did not pursue. Thus, each side misinterpreted the moves of the other, and as a result each claimed victory.|$|E

5|$|The year 1896 {{followed}} {{much the}} same pattern as the previous year. On 10 March 1896, Koester once again raised his flag aboard Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm. Individual ship training was conducted though April, followed by squadron training in the North Sea in late April and early May. This included {{a visit to the}} Dutch ports of Vlissingen and Nieuwediep. Further maneuvers, which lasted from the end of May to the end of July, took the squadron further north in the North Sea, frequently into Norwegian waters. The ships visited Bergen from 11 to 18 May. During the maneuvers, Wilhelm II and the Chinese viceroy Li Hongzhang observed a fleet review off Kiel. On 9 August, the training fleet assembled in Wilhelmshaven for the annual autumn fleet training. Following the conclusion of the maneuvers, Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm again went into dock for maintenance, and while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of service, Koester transferred his flag to Sachsen from 16 September to 3 October. Koester again flew his flag aboard Sachsen from 15 December to 1 March 1897.|$|E
5|$|Marsden reappears on Albert Square in 2009 when Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) is murdered. She {{arrives on}} the scene when several people say they suspect Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), but Marsden waits before {{questioning}} her, and questions the Mitchells first. She makes a televised appeal for witnesses and later interviews Phil, but he is provided an alibi by his girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry). A few days later, a red fingernail is found {{at the scene of}} the murder; Marsden visits the female locals, checking their hands. Seeing an upset Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), knowing that she is vulnerable and lives with Shirley, she talks to Heather about Christmas Day and Heather accidentally tells Marsden that Phil wasn't there. Marsden interviews Phil and later visits his home, asking to see the clothes he was wearing on Christmas Day. Shirley shows her a clean shirt; Marsden closes the laundrette, hoping anyone with blood-stained clothes will not be able to wash them. After a tip-off Marsden arrests Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook); Sam accuses her mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), of the murder. Marsden confirms that she was there to talk to Peggy, questioning Peggy and Sam at the police station. Peggy is released without charge; however, Sam is detained for jumping bail. Marsden visits Janine, who insists that people will say anything to get her in trouble. She asks Janine why <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> in the cold on Christmas Day, and asks if Janine knows where Archie's laptop as it had gone missing.|$|E
