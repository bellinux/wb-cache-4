40|$|Crowd flow {{segmentation}} is {{an important}} step in many video surveillance tasks. In this work, we propose an algorithm for segmenting flows in H. 264 compressed videos in a completely unsupervised manner. Our algorithm works on motion vectors which can be obtained by partially decoding the compressed video without extracting any additional features. Our approach is based on modelling the motion vector field as a Conditional Random Field (CRF) and obtaining oriented motion segments by finding the optimal labelling which minimises the global energy of CRF. These oriented motion segments are recursively merged based on gradient across their boundaries to obtain the final flow segments. This work in compressed domain can be easily extended to pixel domain by <b>substituting</b> <b>motion</b> vectors with motion based features like optical flow. The proposed algorithm is experimentally evaluated on a standard crowd flow dataset and its superior performance in both accuracy and computational time are demonstrated through quantitative results.

30|$|The {{algorithm}} {{takes advantage}} of the normal arm inverse kinematics, so that we don’t need to re-identify the parameters and reconstruction of the manipulator even when the joint fails. After obtaining the graph, we can consider the actual fault condition about the fault tolerance and the size of angle in the fault joint. As a result, when the target matrix rotates around the X-axis in coordinate system with the angle γ, the insufficient DOF manipulator can still be able to complete the scheduled tasks due to the <b>substitute</b> <b>motion</b> by other joints. But if a joint failure occurs in some less flexible operating space, the value of angle γ calculated by this method will be relatively large, which leads {{to the fact that the}} manipulator will fail to complete scheduled tasks with the solution of the six joint angle values, because the corresponding position and posture of the manipulator may cause a collision between the end-effector and the target object.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{interactive}} dynamic background scene generating and editing system is proposed based on improved motion graph. By analyzing the input motions with limited frame length and their metadata, our system could synthesize {{a large amount}} of various motions to yield a composing dynamic background scene with unlimited frame length by connecting the motion pieces through smooth transitions based on their motion graph layers. The motion pieces are generated by segmenting the input motions and corresponding deforming meshes spatially and temporally, while the smooth transitions connected the motion pieces are obtained by searching the best path in the motion graph layers according to the specified circumstances. Finally, the result motions are optimized by repeatedly <b>substituting</b> the <b>motion</b> sub-sequences. To design the dynamic background scene, users c{{an interactive}}ly specify some physical constraints of the environment on the keyframes, such as wind direction or velocity of flow, or even some simple paths for characters to follow, and the system can automatically generate a continuous and natural dynamic background scene in accordance with the user-specified environment constraints...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{estimating}} range flow (space displacement vector field) on nonrigid as well as rigid objects from a sequence of range images is described. This method can directly estimate the deformable motion parameters by solving a system of linear equations that are obtained from substituting a linear transformation of nonrigid objects expressed by the Jacobian matrix into motion constraints based on {{an extension of the}} conventional scheme used in intensity image sequences. The range flow is directly computed by <b>substituting</b> these estimated <b>motion</b> parameters into the linear transformation. The algorithm is supported by experimental estimations of range flow on a sheet of paper, a piece of cloth, human skin, and a rubber balloon being inflated, using real range image sequences acquired by a video rate range camera.

Follow-up time ranged from one to five years, {{with a mean of}} 2. 5 years. Symptoms mimicking the well known ilio - tibial band (ITB) friction syndrome were observed in 77 knees (7. 2 %). Initial conservative treatment consisted of anti-inflammatory medication (77 knees) and local steroid injection (35 knees). The pain persisted in 22 knees (2 %), leading to a surgical release of the iliotibial band. Other surgical interventions included revision for infection (6 knees, 0. 5 %), revision for tibial component loosening (6 knees, 0. 5 %), revision for tibiofemoral dislocation (3 knees, 0. 3 %), revision for patellar component loosening (5 knees, 0. 4 %), revision for instability (1 knee, 0. 1 %) and secondary patellar resurfacing (1 knee, 0. 1 %). The overall survivorship with partial or total implant revision as an endpoint was 98 %. The development of lateral knee pain in association {{with the use of a}} guided motion design can be explained by the forced posterior translation of the lateral condyle in flexion. The asymmetric cam and post mechanism, acting as a hard driver of posterior femoral translation and internal tibial rotation during flexion, does not allow for the natural kinematic variability occurring in native knees. This repetitive and forced stretching of the ITB seems to induce a painful traction syndrome in some patients. status: publishe...|$|R

At that meeting, the APA council passed Resolution 23B, which implemented the 2008 membership vote to remove psychologists from settings that operate outside of international law, and banning the participation of psychologists in unlawful interrogations. With 156 votes in favor and only one vote against, the resolution passed with the near unanimous approval of council members. The adoption of Resolution 23B aligned the APA's policy with that of the American Psychiatric Association and that of the American Medical Association by prohibiting psychologists from participating in interrogations deemed illegal by the Geneva Conventions and the United Nations Convention against Torture.IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2008 MEMBERSHIP VOTE TO REMOVE PSYCHOLOGISTS FROM ALL SETTINGS THAT OPERATE OUTSIDE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW (NBI #23B)Council is asked to approve the <b>substitute</b> main <b>motion</b> below that includes a revised resolution with a new title, Resolution to Amend the 2006 and 2013 Council Resolutions to Clarify the Roles of Psychologists Related to Interrogation and Detainee Welfare in National Security Settings, to Further Implement the 2008 Petition Resolution, and to Safeguard Against Acts of Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in All Settings. This resolution further aligns the APA policy definition for [...] "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment" [...] (in the 2006 and 2013 Council resolutions) with the United Nations (UN) Convention Against Torture and ensures that the definition applies broadly to all individuals and settings; offers APA as a supportive resource for ethical practice for psychologists, including those in military and national security roles; prohibits psychologists from participating in national security interrogations; clarifies the intended application of the 2008 petition resolution... and calls for APA letters to be sent to federal officials to inform them of these policy changes and clarifications of existing APA policy.The ban will not [...] "prohibit psychologists from working with the police or prisons in criminal law enforcement interrogations".|$|R
40|$|F 1 F 0 ATP synthase (ATPase) either {{facilitates}} {{the synthesis of}} ATP in a process driven by the proton moving force (pmf), or uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to pump protons against the concentration gradient across the membrane. ATPase is composed of two rotary motors, F 0 and F 1, which compete for control of their shared γ -shaft. We present a self-consistent physical model of F 1 motor as a simplified two-state Brownian ratchet using the asymmetry of torsional elastic energy of the coiled-coil γ -shaft. This stochastic model unifies the physical concepts of linear and rotary motors, and explains the stepped unidirectional rotary <b>motion.</b> <b>Substituting</b> the model parameters, all independently known from recent experiments, our model quantitatively reproduces the ATPase operation, e. g. the ‘no-load’ angular velocity is ca. 400 rad/s anticlockwise at 4 mM ATP. Increasing the pmf torque exerted by F 0 can slow, stop and overcome the torque generated by F 1, switching from ATP hydrolysis to synthesis at a very low value of ‘stall torque’. We discuss the motor efficiency, which is very low if calculated from the useful mechanical work it produces - but is quite high when the ‘useful outcome’ is measured {{in the number of}} H+ pushed against the chemical gradient...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} risk/reward {{dynamics}} of shareholder litigation have encouraged quick settlements with substantial attorneys’ fee awards but no payment to shareholders, regardless of {{the merits of the}} case. Fee-shifting charter and bylaw provisions may be too blunt a tool to control agency costs associated with excessive shareholder litigation, and are in any event now prohibited by Delaware statute. We claim, however, that active judicial supervision of public company shareholder litigation at an early stage reduces the costs of frivolous litigation to shareholders by separating meritorious from unmeritorious litigation before the full costs of discovery are incurred. Using procedures and doctrines that have not previously been catalogued and appreciated as a coherent set of interrelated dynamics, the Delaware Court of Chancery has relied on the motion to dismiss as the primary procedural vehicle for accomplishing that early stage triage. Such early stage analysis depends upon consideration of essentially undisputed facts, and upon the availability of such facts to the plaintiff shareholder through sources that compensate for the problem of asymmetric access to relevant information. The motion to dismiss in representative shareholder litigation has thus come to resemble, and <b>substitute</b> for, the <b>motion</b> for summary judgment. The Delaware courts’ atypical demand for, and unusual willingness to consider, extensive facts in resolving motions to dismiss encourage defendants to supply relevant information voluntarily, on a cost efficient basis that avoids largely unlimited discovery. Where time constraints preclude disposition via a motion to dismiss, the motion for expedited discovery must necessarily come to serve the same efficiency promoting functions as the motion to dismiss, and the Court of Chancery has come to apply essentially the same level of substantive factual review of the merits encountered in resolving motions to dismiss. The result is a system in which cases are dismissed or settle at the motion to dismiss stage: from 2011 through 2014, for example, there were only four public company shareholder class or derivative suits in which the Court of Chancery resolved the case after trial. With the likely concentration of deal litigation in the Delaware courts resulting from increasingly prevalent exclusive forum charter and bylaw provisions, the motion to dismiss and the motion to expedite discovery are likely to become even more important in promoting the efficient conduct of shareholder class and derivative litigation involving public companies...|$|R
