2500|$|Lady Wu {{agreed with}} Zhou Yu and she said, [...] "What Gongjin said is true. Gongjin {{was around the}} same age as Bofu as he was only a month younger than Bofu. I regard Gongjin as a son, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> treat him like an elder brother." [...] Sun Quan heeded their advice and did not send a hostage to Cao Cao.|$|E
2500|$|Xie Jing (謝景) admired Liu Yi's {{discourse}} on punishment before civility. Lu Xun chided Xie Jing, [...] "The idea of civility before punishment has been long promulgated and espoused. Liu Yi is wrong when he distorted {{the teachings of}} ancient sages through his sly manipulation of words. You're serving in the Crown Prince's residence, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> advocate the principles of benevolence and righteousness {{in order to promote}} moral virtues. Ideas (like Liu Yi's) should never be discussed again." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Jiang Biao Zhuan (江表傳) {{mentioned}} that Sun Quan once told Lü Meng and Jiang Qin, [...] "Both {{of you are}} commanders now <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> enrich yourself with knowledge." [...] Lü Meng replied, [...] "I've many things to attend to in the army, so I'm afraid I won't have time to read." [...] Sun Quan then said, [...] Lü Meng was so inspired by Sun Quan's words {{that he began to}} study diligently and acquire more knowledge. He eventually surpassed some Confucian scholars in terms of the amount of texts he read.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2007, The Huffington Post {{published}} Hart's letter, [...] "Unsolicited Advice to the Government of Iran", {{in which}} he stated that [...] "Provocation is no longer required to take America to war" [...] and warns Iran that [...] "for the next sixteen months or <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not only not take provocative actions, you should {{not seem to be}} doing so." [...] He went on to suggest that the Bush-Cheney administration was waiting for an opportunity to attack Iran, writing: [...] "Don't give a certain vice president we know the justification he is seeking to attack your country." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lu Su led his {{followers}} and some civilians southward to Juchao County to join Zhou Yu. He ordered able-bodied {{young men to}} guard the rear while the others moved ahead first. The local authorities sent some armed horsemen to stop Lu Su and his party from leaving. When the riders caught up with them, Lu Su turned back and said, [...] "You're all men of courage, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> understand the situation well. The country {{is now in a}} state of chaos. You won't be rewarded for your efforts (even if you succeed in stopping us), but neither will you be punished if you don't pursue us. Do you really want to force us (to fight)?" [...] He then placed a shield upright on the ground and fired an arrow at it, piercing through the shield. The horsemen agreed with what Lu Su said and knew they could not stop him, so they gave up and left. Lu Su then crossed the Yangtze River with Zhou Yu and arrived in Jiangdong, where they met Sun Ce, who felt that Lu Su was a special person. Lu Su settled in Qu'e County (曲阿縣; in present-day Danyang, Jiangsu). When his grandmother died, he returned to Dongcheng County to attend her funeral.|$|E

2500|$|Cao Cao admired Guan Yu's character, {{but he also}} {{sensed that}} Guan had no {{intention}} of serving under him for long. He told Zhang Liao, [...] "Why don't you make use of your friendship with Guan Yu to find out his objective?" [...] When Zhang Liao asked Guan Yu, the latter replied, [...] "I'm aware that Lord Cao treats me very generously. However, I've also received many favours from General Liu and I've sworn to follow him until I die. I cannot break my oath. I'll leave eventually, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> help me convey my message to Lord Cao." [...] Zhang Liao did so, and Cao Cao was further impressed with Guan Yu. The Fu Zi gave a slightly different account of this incident. It stated that Zhang Liao had a dilemma on whether to convey Guan Yu's message to Cao Cao or not: if he did, Cao Cao might execute Guan Yu; if he did not, he would be failing in his service to Cao Cao. He sighed, [...] "Lord Cao is my superior and is like a father to me; Guan Yu is like a brother to me." [...] He eventually made his decision to tell Cao Cao. Cao Cao said, [...] "A subject who serves a lord but does not forget his origins is truly a man of righteousness. When do you think he will leave?" [...] Zhang Liao replied, [...] "Guan Yu has received favours from Your Excellency. He'll most probably leave after he has repaid your kindness." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Wu Shu {{recorded}} that Sun Ce once led {{a military}} expedition against the Shanyue and {{ventured into the}} hills alone after slaying the Shanyue chief and sending his men to pursue and destroy the remaining Shanyue forces. He encountered Yu Fan, who asked him where his bodyguards were. When Sun Ce {{told him that he}} had ordered his bodyguards to join the rest of his men in attacking the Shanyue, Yu Fan exclaimed, [...] "This is so dangerous!" [...] He then asked Sun Ce to dismount from his horse and said, [...] "The terrain here is deep and dangerous. You can't control your horse well under such conditions, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> travel on foot, guide your horse along, and arm yourself with a bow and arrows. I'm good in using a spear and I'll lead the way." [...] After reaching flat ground, Sun Ce mounted his horse again and asked Yu Fan, [...] "You don't have a horse. What are you going to do?" [...] Yu Fan replied, [...] "I can travel on foot. I'm capable of travelling 300 li in a day. Since the start of the campaigns, no one has been able to match my pace. You can try letting a horse run and I'll catch up with it on foot." [...] They encountered a signaller at the main road. Sun Ce took the signaller's horn and blew it. His men recognised the sound of the horn and rushed there to join him. They patrolled the area and pacified the three commanderies.|$|E
2500|$|As chaos {{broke out}} {{throughout}} China {{towards the end}} of the Eastern Han dynasty, Pang Xi wanted to improve security within Baxi Commandery, so he recruited more men to serve as soldiers. Around the time, Liu Zhang heard rumours that Pang Xi was planning to rebel against him and became more suspicious of Pang. When Pang Xi heard about it, he became fearful and started making preparations to increase the strength of his military forces. He also sent Cheng Yu (程郁), Cheng Ji's son, who was serving in the commandery office, to persuade Cheng Ji to support him in rebelling against Liu Zhang. Cheng Ji wrote to Pang Xi, [...] "Your original intention in recruiting more soldiers was not to start a rebellion. There might have been some misunderstanding, but what is more important is you are performing your duties. If you are fearful and start thinking of rebelling, I will not listen to you." [...] He also wrote to Cheng Yu, [...] "I received grace from the provincial government, so I am obliged to do my best to serve the Governor. You are serving in the commandery office, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> do your best to serve the Administrator. You should not be thinking of rebelling." [...] Pang Xi sent a message to Cheng Ji, [...] "Your son is serving in the commandery office. Your family will be in trouble if you do not obey the Administrator!" [...] Cheng Ji replied, [...] "Yue Yang (樂羊) ate his son's flesh not because he did not love his son, but because he was doing so for the sake of upholding righteousness. If you were to make me do the same thing, I'll do it." [...] Pang Xi realised that Cheng Ji would never support him, so he abandoned the idea of rebelling against Liu Zhang; instead, he apologised to Liu Zhang and was pardoned. When Liu Zhang heard about Cheng Ji's loyalty towards him, he promoted Cheng to serve as the Administrator of Jiangyang Commandery (江陽郡; around present-day Luzhou, Sichuan).|$|E
