He is notable for designing Boston's Public Garden; the Massachusetts Bicycle Club; and churches, homes, and monuments in greater Boston and elsewhere in New England.

40|$|Background: The morphometry of {{the palate}} and {{pharyngeal}} airway has {{a crucial role}} in the development of disorders like apnea. Therefore the present study aims to explore the shape and dimensions of the palate and the pharyngeal airway. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out on normal sagittal and axial sections of head and neck in 100 CT images. Results: The average length of the hard and soft palates measured 4. 49 ± 0. 38 and 3. 44 ± 0. 61 cm respectively. The anteroposterior dimension of the soft palate was 0. 90 ± 0. 33 cm. The velopalatine angle measured 130. 23 ± 9. 98 º. The luminal areas were 4. 59 ± 1. 81, 2. 058 ± 1. 09 and 2. 99 ± 1. 08 cm in naso, oro and laryngo pharynx respectively. The soft palate showed varied shapes which were classified as a straight line, leaf-like, rat-tail, distorted <b>S,</b> <b>crooked</b> and butt like. Conclusion: The present study attempts to provide a normal database to understand the anatomy of the soft palate and pharyngeal airways...|$|R

The DRSEQ is a sound psychometric instrument based on exploratory factor analyses, but has not been subjected to confirmatory factor analysis. In total 2773 participants were used to confirm the factor structure of the DRSEQ. Initial analyses revealed that the original structure was not confirmed in the current study. Subsequent analyses resulted in a revised factor structure (DRSEQ-R) being confirmed in community, student and clinical samples. The DRSEQ-R was also found to have good construct and concurrent validity. The factor structure of the DRSEQ-R is more stable than the original structure of the DRSEQ and the revised scale has considerable potential in future alcohol-related research.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the aeroacoustic and fluid-dynamic nature of the flow field in and around a generic aircraft cavity in order to characterise the physical mechanism of noise and vibration generated by the flow. This paper discusses the experimental investigation of a narrow, shallow, rectangular cavity in both wind and water tunnel facilities. The experimental investigation primarily focuses on boundary layer characteristics, surface pressure distributions and surface flow visualisation. Qualitative and quantitative results are discussed. This paper reports results for cavities of length:depth:width ratios of 6 : 1 : 2. The principal findings are in agreement with an "open" type flow as stated in the literature, however the flow within the cavity is highly three-dimensional in contrast with the suggestions of Stallings & Wilcox (1987). Significant three-dimensionality is also evident downstream of the cavity, close to the training edge. Further findings suggest the shear layer impinges below the edge of the rear wall in the mean, leading to a net inflow of free-stream fluid into the cavity at the centre line, which is balanced by an outflow adjacent to the side walls. Finally, a number of vortices are present at the rear wall, including a corner vortex at the base of the rear wall, and a vortex associated with flow separation on the trailing board adjacent to the rear wall edge. <b>S.</b> <b>Crook,</b> R.

40|$|CD 1 d-restricted {{lymphocytes}} {{recognize a}} broad lipid range. However, how CD 1 d-restricted lymphocytes translate T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of lipids with similar group heads into distinct biological responses remains unclear. Using a soluble invariant NKT (iNKT) TCR and a newly engineered antibody specific for alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) -human CD 1 d (hCD 1 d) complexes, we measured the affinity of binding of iNKT TCR to hCD 1 d molecules loaded with {{a panel of}} alpha-GalCer analogues and assessed the rate of dissociation of alpha-GalCer and alpha-GalCer analogues from hCD 1 d molecules. We extended this analysis by studying iNKT cell synapse formation and iNKT cell activation by the same panel of alpha-GalCer analogues. Our results indicate the unique role of the lipid chain occupying the hCD 1 d F' channel in modulating TCR binding affinity to hCD 1 d-lipid complexes, the formation of stable immunological synapse, and cell activation. These data are consistent with previously described conformational changes between empty and loaded hCD 1 d molecules (Koch, M., V. <b>S.</b> Stronge, D. <b>Shepherd,</b> <b>S.</b> D. Gadola, B. Mathew, G. Ritter, A. R. Fersht, G. S. Besra, R. R. Schmidt, E. Y. Jones, and V. Cerundolo. 2005. Nat. Immunol 6 : 819 - 826), suggesting that incomplete occupation of the hCD 1 d F' channel results in conformational differences at the TCR recognition surface. This indirect effect provides a general mechanism by which lipid-specific lymphocytes are capable of recognizing both the group head {{and the length of}} lipid antigens, ensuring greater specificity of antigen recognition...|$|R
40|$|The {{foraging}} behaviour, territory {{size and}} diet of the scalyfin, Parma victoriae, were studied at three sites in South Australia. Two sites were in Ecklonia habitat on an exposed coast, one of them, Site 1, in a marine reserve at West I., and the other, Site 2, in an intensely fished area at The Bluff, Victor Harbor. The third, Site 3, was sheltered, in a fucoid community in Groper Bay, Flinders I., {{in the eastern}} Great Australian Bight. The algal food supply was highest at the reserve site (1), and lowest at the sheltered site (3). The scalyfin spent {{a greater proportion of}} time foraging, and a lower proportion of time sheltering, at the reserve site (1), than at the Bluff site (2). At Site 3, territories were about seven times larger than at the other two sites, and fish spent a higher proportion of time in defence and aggressive interactions than at the other sites. The diet at all sites was predominantly browsed rhodophytes, but at Site 3 the rhodophytes eaten were almost entirely epiphytic on fucoid algae and in low abundance. At the exposed sites (1, 2), where food algae were patchy, scalyfin removed Ecklonia sporophytes experimentally placed in their territories, but not at Site 3, dominated by fucoids. At the exposed sites they employed a saltatory foraging mode, whereas at Site 3 they adopted a cruise search foraging behaviour over their larger territories. Both modes seem optimal in their respective habitats. <b>Shepherd,</b> <b>S.</b> A.; Clark, M. and Ferguson, G. [URL]...|$|R
