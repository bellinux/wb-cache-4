25|$|Los Testigos, or the Aparamán range, is a {{chain of}} four rather small and floristically similar tepuis forming a bridge between Auyán Tepui {{in the west and}} Ptari Tepui in the east. From west to east the four major peaks are: Aparamán Tepui (2100m), Murisipán Tepui (2350m), Tereke-yurén Tepui (1900m), and Kamarkawarai Tepui (2400m), the latter three sharing a common <b>slope</b> <b>area.</b> There however remains some {{confusion}} in the literature regarding the names of these peaks.|$|E
25|$|The {{area that}} today {{comprises}} {{the neighborhood of}} Park Slope was first inhabited by the Native Americans of the Lenape people. The Dutch colonized the area by the 17th century and farmed the region for more than 200 years. During the American Revolutionary War, on August 27, 1776, the Park <b>Slope</b> <b>area</b> served as the backdrop {{for the beginning of}} the Battle of Long Island. In this battle, over 10,000 British soldiers and Hessian mercenaries routed outnumbered American forces. The historic site of Battle Pass is now preserved in Prospect Park, and on Fifth Avenue there is a reconstruction of the stone farmhouse where a countercharge covered the American retreat.|$|E
25|$|A landslide, {{also known}} as a {{landslip}} or Mudslide, is a form of mass wasting that includes a wide range of ground movements, such as rockfalls, deep failure of slopes, and shallow debris flows. Landslides can occur underwater, called a submarine landslide, coastal and onshore environments. Although the action of gravity is the primary driving force for a landslide to occur, there are other contributing factors affecting the original slope stability. Typically, pre-conditional factors build up specific sub-surface conditions that make the <b>slope</b> <b>area</b> prone to failure, whereas the actual landslide often requires a trigger before being released. Landslides {{should not be confused with}} mudflows, a form of mass wasting involving very to extremely rapid flow of debris that has become partially or fully liquefied by the addition of significant amounts of water to the source material.|$|E

As cities and residential areas have expanded the living space for people has spread to such hilly or <b>sloped</b> <b>areas.</b> Mobile communication systems are already a vital infrastructure to daily life, so covering these <b>sloped</b> <b>areas</b> is important in terms of service provisioning.

2500|$|The {{island has}} {{three types of}} habitats: coral reef, {{seagrass}} and nesting ground for marine turtles. Zoning of the coral reef is mapped under three zones of reef flat, reef slope and lagoon. Next to the shore line are the fringing reefs where fish species of fin and shell fishes spawn, and are found in abundance. As of 1986, there were 45 coral species in the reef. These are threatened due to human interference and natural causes. Live coral is reported in less than 1% area. There are 9 species of live corals in the lagoon and reef <b>slope</b> <b>area.</b> The species of live corals reported are: Acropora formosa (staghorn coral), Acropora robusta, Acropora, Acropora subglabra, [...] Acropora tortuosa, Acropora vaughani, Favites, Pocillopora verrucosa and Lobophytum Benthic organisms are reported on the reef slope and lagoon area. Macrobenthos {{are found in the}} inter-tidal and sub-tidal area. 23 species of polychaetes, 3 species of bivalves, 3 species of crustaceans, and 3 species of gastropods have been recorded.|$|E
2500|$|Baseball {{had also}} played a {{prominent}} role {{in the history of the}} Park <b>Slope</b> <b>area.</b> From 1879 to 1889, the Brooklyn Atlantics (later to become the Dodgers) played at Washington Park on 5th Avenue between 3rd and 4th Streets. When the park was destroyed by a fire, the team moved to their part-time home in Ridgewood, Queens and then to a park in East New York. [...] In 1898, the [...] "New" [...] Washington Park was built between Third and Fourth Avenues and between First and Third Streets near the Gowanus Canal. The team, by this point known as the Dodgers, played to an ever-growing fan base at this location. By the end of the 1912 season, it was clear that the team had outgrown the field, and the neighborhood. Team owner Charles Ebbets moved the team to his Ebbets Field stadium in Flatbush for the beginning of the 1913 season. [...] The team went on to have historic crosstown rivalries with both the New York Giants and New York Yankees.|$|E
