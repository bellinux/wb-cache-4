5|$|The vastness {{and variety}} of Canada's climates, ecology, vegetation, fauna, and landform separations have defined ancient peoples implicitly into {{cultural}} or linguistic divisions.

Language contributes to {{the identity of a}} people by influencing social life ways and spiritual practices. Aboriginal religions developed from anthropomorphism and animism philosophies.|$|E

5|$|A {{subsequent}} caldera-forming eruption occurred about 160,000 years ago. It {{formed the}} relatively small caldera that contains the West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> supereruption, a series of smaller eruptive cycles between 640,000 and 70,000years ago, has nearly filled in the Yellowstone Caldera with 80 different eruptions of rhyolitic lavas {{such as those that}} can be seen at Obsidian Cliffs and basaltic lavas which can be viewed at Sheepeater Cliff. Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic V-shaped valley, indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by glaciation.|$|E

The primary focus is the Japanese American incarceration era, as specified in the legislation that created the Manzanar National Historic Site. The site also interprets the former town of Manzanar, the ranch days, the settlement by the Owens Valley Paiute, and the role that water played in shaping the history of the Owens Valley.|$|E
5|$|Some {{friendly}} matches {{are played}} at smaller venues. Pittodrie Stadium in Aberdeen and Easter Road in Edinburgh were both used as venues during the 2012–13 season. Other stadiums {{were also used}} while Hampden was being redeveloped during the 1990s. Celtic Park, Pittodrie Stadium, Ibrox Stadium and Rugby Park all hosted matches during the 1998 World Cup qualifying campaign, while Tynecastle Stadium, Pittodrie, Celtic Park and Ibrox were used for Euro 2000 qualifying matches. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> redevelopment to Hampden was completed in 1999, Scotland have played most of their competitive matches there. The most recent exception to this rule was in 2014, when Hampden was temporarily converted into an athletics stadium for the 2014 Commonwealth Games.|$|E
5|$|The clock has its {{original}} medieval face. As well as showing {{the time on}} a 24-hour dial, it reflects {{the motion of the}} Sun and Moon, the phases of the Moon, and the time <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> new Moon. The astronomical dial represents a geocentric or pre-Copernican view of the universe, with the Sun and Moon revolving round a central fixed Earth, like that of the clock at Ottery St Mary. The quarters are chimed by a quarter jack {{in the form of a}} small automaton known as Jack Blandifers, who hits two bells with hammers and two with his heels. At the striking of the clock, jousting knights appear above the clock face.|$|E

5|$|The {{landscape}} {{consists of}} a crescent of low chalk hills, the Yorkshire Wolds, surrounded by the low-lying fertile plains of Holderness and the Vale of York.

5|$|The three coves to {{the east}} of Helvellyn are all {{important}} sites for remnant populations of arctic-alpine plants. Species such as downy willow (Salix lapponum), mountain avens (Dryas octopetala), alpine mouse-ear (Cerastium alpinum), alpine meadowgrass (Poa alpina) and others have been able to survive in these coves <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> glaciation through a combination of rocks rich in basic minerals, a harsh micro-climate, and inaccessibility to grazing sheep on cliff ledges. However, these populations are small and are not reproducing well. Natural England has introduced a recovery plan for them.|$|E

The letters [...] "AC" [...] stand for [...] "Anno Catulorum," [...] which again is Latin-based, meaning [...] "In the Year of the Cubs." [...] The numbers which follow refer to three different date markers—counting <b>the</b> years <b>since</b> <b>the</b> team’s seasonal and playoff success. The first two represent the number of seasons <b>since</b> <b>the</b> Cubs <b>last</b> won <b>the</b> National League Central division title (2016). The next two represent the number of seasons <b>since</b> <b>the</b> Cubs <b>last</b> won <b>the</b> National League pennant (2016). <b>The</b> <b>last</b> three (originally two) represent the number of seasons <b>since</b> <b>the</b> Cubs <b>last</b> won <b>the</b> World Series (2016). Using this vernacular, AC0000000 would indicate that the Cubs won the division and National League title and World Series title this year.
