40|$|We {{investigated}} {{relations between}} seismic gaps in active <b>seismic</b> <b>zones</b> and occurrence of middle-size earthquakes by using of a microearthquake catalog compiled for 25 years by Tottori Observatory which belongs to Research Center for Earthquake Prediction, Disaster Prevention Research Institute, Kyoto University. Our study sites are active <b>seismic</b> <b>zones</b> of Tottori region, Tottori-Shimane border region and Yamasaki Fault {{region in the}} Inner zone of Southwest Japan. We examined preceding seismic activity in and around a focal area of 10 middle-size earthquakes in the active <b>seismic</b> <b>zones.</b> The result is that in most cases a middle-size earthquake(s) occurred in a seismic gap in the active <b>seismic</b> <b>zones,</b> {{some of which were}} preceded by small-size earthquakes. To point out present seismic gaps in active <b>seismic</b> <b>zones</b> can, therefore, be a clue of prediction of inland middle-size earthquakes. We investigated spatial distribution of the hypocenters in detail and found out 19 seismic gaps in the active <b>seismic</b> <b>zones.</b> After we pointed out the seismic gaps, earthquakes with magnitude 3. 9 and 4. 0 occurred in one of the seismic gaps. We intend to keep watch on seismic activity in and around these seismic gaps and try to detect precursory change of the seismic activity before occurrence of middle-size earthquakes...|$|R

5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{originated in}} the Eastern Tennessee <b>Seismic</b> <b>Zone,</b> a fault noted for earthquakes of moderate magnitude. Faulting in the area is strike-slip-oriented probably because of the Alabama-New York Lineament, which runs adjacent to the fault. Several scientists believe that the small earthquakes from the zone highlight the reactivation of deep, ancient faults. Alabama has seen roughly 20 earthquakes {{since the beginning of}} the 20th century. The earthquakes have been moderate, never reaching above magnitude 5.1, and tend to cause damage only near their epicenters while reaching areas much further away. Major events include those in 1916, 1997, and 2003. Despite the lack of powerful seismic events in Alabama, earthquakes from nearby fault zones, including the New Madrid <b>Seismic</b> <b>Zone,</b> pose a serious threat to infrastructure. Even an earthquake similar in size to the 1916Irondaleevent today could damage thousands of buildings and cause up to $1billion in damage.|$|E
5|$|Within the region, {{millions}} {{felt the}} rupture. Reactions to the earthquake varied: some people near the epicenter did not {{react to the}} shaking, while others panicked. A future earthquake {{in the region is}} extremely likely; in 2005, seismologists and geologists estimated a 90% chance of a magnitude 6–7 tremor before 2055, likely originating in the Wabash Valley <b>seismic</b> <b>zone</b> on the Illinois–Indiana border or the New Madrid fault zone.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to define <b>seismic</b> <b>zones</b> in the Azores based on statistical criteria. These <b>seismic</b> <b>zones</b> will likely be used in seismic simulations of occurrences in the Azores Archipelago. The data used in this work cover the time period from 1915 to 2011. The Azores region was divided into 1 ° × 1 ° area units, for which the seismicity and the maximum magnitudes of events were calculated. The seismicity, the largest earthquakes recorded and the geological characteristics of the region were used to group these area units because similar <b>seismic</b> <b>zones</b> must delineate areas with homogeneous seismic characteristics. We have identified seven <b>seismic</b> <b>zones.</b> To verify that the defined areas differ statistically, we considered the following dissimilarity measures (variables) : time, size and seismic conditions – the number of seismic events with specific characteristics. Statistical tests, particularly goodness-of-fit tests, allowed us to conclude that, considering these three variables, the seven earthquake zones defined here are statistically distinct...|$|R

The reverse faults formed during the various orogenies were partly reactivated as normal faults in extension during the Mesozoic Era as the supercontinent Pangaea broke apart. During the Cenozoic Era, compression from the opening and spreading of the Atlantic has caused some of these structures to be reactivated in a reverse sense.|$|E

5|$|The {{two major}} rivers {{draining}} Tiruchirappalli are the Kaveri and its tributary the Kollidam, {{but the city}} is also drained by the Uyyakondan Channel, Koraiyar and Kudamuritti river channels. The land immediately surrounding the Kaveri River—which crosses Tiruchirappalli from west to east—consists of deposits of fertile alluvial soil on which crops such as finger millet and maize are cultivated. Further south, the surface is covered by poor-quality black soil. A belt of Cretaceous rock known as the Trichinopoly Group runs to the north-east of the city, and to the south-east there are layers of archaean rocks, granite and gneiss covered by a thin bed of conglomeratic laterite. The region falls under <b>Seismic</b> <b>Zone</b> III, which is moderately vulnerable to earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{originated in}} the Eastern Tennessee <b>Seismic</b> <b>Zone,</b> among the most active seismic areas in the Southeastern United States and one capable of producing moderately strong earthquakes, a few of which have caused damage. The frequency for non-damaging earthquakes from this zone measures out to about one per year, and it has produced many faint earthquakes recorded on seismographs. Such earthquakes have been helpful in highlighting the activity of faults below the Paleozoic detachment. Fault-plane solutions of multiple earthquakes throughout the area confirmed strike-slip faulting between two steeply declining planes. Both right and left-lateral movement occurs in the area, most movement being associated with north-to-south planes (right-lateral) and east-to-west planes (left-lateral). All of these mechanisms indicate reactivation of basement faults below more-recent faults. These basement faults probably converge on one another, and one being strong and the other being weak, produce earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|The San Andreas Fault has offset Indian stone rings, {{its path}} is buried by sediments from Lake Cahuilla. During the Pleistocene, this fault was {{relatively}} inactive {{compared to the}} Imperial Fault and the San Jacinto Fault. Other faults that crossed the shores of Lake Cahuilla are the Extra fault zone, which divides a northern more stable basin from a southern basin that underwent tectonic extension and slightly slower sedimentation, the Coyote Creek Fault (whose movement rate has been estimated from displacement of Lake Cahuilla sediments and probably accelerated {{during the time of}} Cahuilla's highstand), the Superstition Mountain Fault which extends from the Coyote Creek fault, the San Jacinto Fault which runs parallel to part of Cahuilla's western shore, was last active in 820-1280, 1280, 1440-1637 and 1440-1640 and whose fault trace could be buried beneath sediments from Lake Cahuilla, and the Elmore Ranch fault which displays evidence of after-lake activity in the Superstition Hills. Faults on the lake floor include the Brawley <b>Seismic</b> <b>Zone,</b> potentially the Cerro Prieto Fault, the Imperial Fault, and the Kane Springs Faults. The Imperial Fault may have ruptured together with a rupture of the San Andreas Fault during a highstand of Lake Cahuilla, and was last active during the 1940 Imperial Valley earthquake.|$|E

40|$|A new ductile moment-resisting beam–column {{connection}} is developed for precast reinforced concrete (RC) frames in high <b>seismic</b> <b>zones.</b> The proposed connection provides good structural integrity in the connections and can reduce construction time {{by eliminating the}} need for formworks and welding, and minimizing cast-in-place concrete volume.

Test specimens were subjected to a constant axial load and a reverse cyclic loading based on a given displacement history. Flexural strength, ductility, strength degradation and energy dissipation capacity of the precast and monolithic connections are compared. The proposed interior and exterior moment-resisting connections proved to be efficient at improving the seismic performance of precast concrete frames in high <b>seismic</b> <b>zones.</b> While the precast connections provided adequate flexural strength, strength degradation and drift capacity, they exhibited considerably higher ductility and energy dissipation compared to similar monolithic specimens...|$|R
