5|$|Cherry Springs State Park and the {{surrounding}} Susquehannock State Forest have recovered from the clearcutting of the lumber era. However, {{the composition of the}} forests has changed, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are now more hardwoods, including sugar maple and black cherry, and fewer eastern white pine and eastern hemlock. The park also has apple trees from the CCC orchard. Over 400species of birds have been found in Pennsylvania, including 186that breed in the state. Birds such as ospreys, hawks, owls, nightjars, and bald eagles have returned to the park and state forest, and saw-whet owls have been studied in the park.|$|E
5|$|During Eastern Han, the conscripted army largely {{gave way}} to a {{volunteer}} army. The conscripted army under the Minister of the Guards was no longer referred to as the Southern Army. The Northern Army was retained, although it was reformed <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were five Colonels instead of eight. The Eastern Han-era Colonels of the Northern Army were also demoted to the rank of Equivalent to 2,000-dan.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, Romney left Bain & Company to cofound the {{spin-off}} {{private equity}} investment firm, Bain Capital. He had initially refrained from accepting Bill Bain's offer to head the new venture, until Bain rearranged the terms in a complicated partnership structure <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no financial or professional risk to Romney. Bain and Romney raised the $37million in funds needed to start the new operation, which had seven employees. Romney held the titles of president and managing general partner. Though he was the sole shareholder of the firm, publications also referred to him as managing director or CEO.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{construction}} of a new harbour had begun, the Kidwelly and Llanelli Canal Company constructed a tramway from Llanelli to Pwll colliery. Another tramway was built from Burry Port to the coal levels at New Lodge, with a branch to Kilrhos. The company planned to link New Lodge to Pwll in due course, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would be a tramway link from Burry Port harbour to Llanelli; the connection was eventually opened on 8 July 1837.|$|E
5|$|The daric {{was called}} dārayaka within the empire and {{was most likely}} named after Darius. In an effort to further improve trade, Darius built canals, {{underground}} waterways and a powerful navy. He further improved and expanded the network of roads and way stations throughout the empire, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a system of travel authorization for the King, satraps and other high officials, which entitled the traveller to draw provisions at daily stopping places.|$|E

5|$|The tooth enamel is well {{preserved}} {{over most}} of the tooth. It consists of prisms—bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals—with an average diameter of 3.8m. Most are entirely surrounded by a sheath, but in some the sheath is open. The prisms are slightly curved toward the outer surface of the tooth. Between the prisms, and oriented at an angle of about 45° to them, are crystals of interprismatic material. On average, the prisms are 6.57μm apart, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are about 27,247 per mm2.|$|E
5|$|The writers created Mahone's {{character}} in the second season <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would be a fugitive pursuer who was not corrupt. When the writers saw {{that the number of}} antagonists was increasing, they decided to make him the alter ego of Scofield. The writers try to let Mahone inhabit a gray area, shifting the audience's sympathy for the character. Fichtner, attracted to the potential of the character, was cast as Mahone just one day before filming began for the second season; he signed on for only two seasons, but was convinced to appear in a third.|$|E
5|$|After 1999, {{the only}} member of the Keating Five {{remaining}} in the U.S. Senate was John McCain, who had an easier time gaining re-election in 1992 than he anticipated. He survived the political scandal in part by becoming friendly with the political press. McCain subsequently ran for president in 2000 and became the Republican presidential nominee in 2008. During the 2000s, several retrospective accounts of the controversy reiterated the contention that McCain was included in the investigation primarily <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would be at least one Republican target. Glenn's inclusion in the investigation has been attributed to Republicans who were angered by the inclusion of McCain, as well as committee members who thought that dropping Glenn (and McCain) would make it look bad for the remaining three Democratic Senators.|$|E

5|$|Among other {{inhabitants}} of London are 10,000 red foxes, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are now 16 foxes for every square mile (2.6 square kilometres) of London. These urban foxes are noticeably bolder than their country cousins, sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs in people's backyards. Foxes have even sneaked into the Houses of Parliament, where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet. Another {{broke into the}} grounds of Buckingham Palace, reportedly killing some of Queen ElizabethII's prized pink flamingos. Generally, however, foxes and city folk appear to get along. A survey in 2001 by the London-based Mammal Society found that 80 percent of 3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around. This sample cannot be taken to represent Londoners as a whole.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with the rich ornamentation of the main building, the galleries in the Sainsbury Wing are pared-down and intimate, to suit the smaller scale {{of many of the}} paintings. The main inspirations for these rooms are Sir John Soane's toplit galleries for the Dulwich Picture Gallery and the church interiors of Filippo Brunelleschi (the stone dressing is in pietra serena, the grey stone local to Florence). The northernmost galleries align with Barry's central axis, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a single vista down the whole length of the Gallery. This axis is exaggerated by the use of false perspective, as the columns flanking each opening gradually diminish in size until the visitor reaches the focal point (as of 2009), an altarpiece by Cima of The Incredulity of St Thomas. Venturi's postmodernist approach to architecture is in full evidence at the Sainsbury Wing, with its stylistic quotations from buildings as disparate as the clubhouses on Pall Mall, the Scala Regia in the Vatican, Victorian warehouses and Ancient Egyptian temples.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{characteristic}} tusks, the cheek teeth of derived heterodontosaurids were also unique among early ornithischians. Small ridges, or denticles, lined {{the edges of}} ornithischian cheek teeth in order to crop vegetation. These denticles extend {{only a third of}} the way down the tooth crown from the tip in all heterodontosaurids; in other ornithischians, the denticles extend further down towards the root. Basal forms like Abrictosaurus had cheek teeth in both maxilla and dentary that were generally similar to other ornithischians: widely spaced, each having a low crown and a strongly-developed ridge (cingulum) separating the crown from the root. In more derived forms like Lycorhinus and Heterodontosaurus, the teeth were chisel-shaped, with much higher crowns and no cingula, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no difference in width between the crowns and the roots.|$|E

5|$|North of the station, tracks 7 and 6 {{merge into}} one track (with a switch from track 7 to track 8), tracks 5 through 2 merge into another track, and tracks 1 and 8 stay separate, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a four-tracked {{structure}} when the BMT West End Line and BMT Sea Beach Line cross the Coney Island Creek. Before the structure crosses the creek, all four tracks have switches that connect the tracks to each other, before the West End and Sea Beach Lines split. Tracks from these lines then lead into Coney Island Yard. South of the station, tracks 4, 5, and 6 stay {{separate from the}} other tracks (with a pair of switches between tracks 5 and 6) and tracks 1, 2, and 3 merge and have a diamond crossover with track 4. Tracks 3 and 4 (the Brighton Line tracks) are above tracks 5 and 6 (the Culver Line tracks) at this point.|$|E
5|$|On January 4, 2017, {{the office}} of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo {{announced}} a plan to renovate the entire airport {{at a cost of}} $7–10 billion. As part of the project, the AirTrain JFK would either see lengthened trainsets or a direct track connection to the rest of New York City's transportation system. There would also be a rebuilding the Jamaica station <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a direct connection to the Long Island Rail Road and New York City Subway. There is no proposed start date for the overhaul. Shortly after Cuomo's announcement, the Regional Plan Association published a study in which it studied a possible direct rail link from Manhattan. In July 2017, Cuomo's office began accepting proposals for master plans to renovate the airport.|$|E
5|$|Spawning is {{generally}} driven by environmental {{factors such as}} changes in the water temperature, and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the phase of the moon. Many species of Cnidaria may spawn simultaneously in the same location, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are too many ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage— one famous example is the Great Barrier Reef, where at least 110 corals and a few non-cnidarian invertebrates produce enough gametes to turn the water cloudy. These mass spawnings may produce hybrids, some of which can settle and form polyps, {{but it is not}} known how long these can survive. In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species.|$|E

5|$|The P90 was {{designed}} to have a length no greater than a man's shoulder width, {{to allow it to}} be easily carried and maneuvered in tight spaces, such as the inside of an armored vehicle. To achieve this, the weapon's design uses the unconventional bullpup configuration, in which the action and magazine are located behind the trigger and alongside the shooter's face <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no wasted space in the stock. The P90's dimensions are minimized by its unique horizontally mounted feeding system, wherein the box magazine sits parallel to the barrel on top of the weapon's frame. The weapon overall has an extremely compact profile—it is the most compact fixed-stock submachine gun to be made. The standard version of the weapon has an overall length of 500mm (19.7in), a height of 210mm (8.3in), and a width of 55mm (2.2in).|$|E
5|$|The cookiecutter shark has an elongated, cigar-shaped {{body with}} a short, bulbously rounded snout. The {{nostrils}} have a very short flap of skin in front. The large, oval, green eyes are placed forward on the head, though not <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is extensive binocular vision. Behind the eyes are large spiracles, positioned on the upper surface of the head. The mouth is short, forming a nearly transverse line, and is surrounded by enlarged, fleshy, suctorial lips. There are 3037 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2531 tooth rows in the lower jaw, increasing with body size. The upper and lower teeth are extremely different: the upper teeth are small, narrow, and upright, tapering to a single, smooth-edged cusp. The lower teeth are also smooth-edged, but much larger, broader, and knife-like, with their bases interlocking to form a single saw-like cutting edge. The five pairs of gill slits are small.|$|E
5|$|The race {{itself was}} much like its Greek counterpart, {{although}} there were usually 24 races every day that, during the fourth century, took place on 66 days each year. However, a race consisted of only 7 laps (and later 5 laps, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> could be even more races per day), instead of the 12 laps of the Greek race. The Roman style was also more money-oriented; racers were professionals and there was widespread betting among spectators. There were four-horse chariots (quadrigae) and two-horse chariots (bigae), but the four-horse races were more important. In rare cases, if a driver wanted {{to show off his}} skill, he could use up to 10 horses, although this was extremely impractical.|$|E
