40|$|Large spacing {{devices have}} been shown to provide more {{selective}} delivery of an inhaled steroid to the lung but the effect on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal suppression associated with high dose inhaled corticosteroids has been little studied. The effect of a large <b>spacing</b> <b>device</b> (Volumatic; 750 ml) on suppression of 0900 h cortisol after 2 mg inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate was therefore investigated in normal, healthy volunteers. Twenty four subjects (12 male, 12 female) took part in a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled cross over study in which a single dose of 2 mg beclomethasone dipropionate was taken at 2300 h on two occasions seven days apart, once from a metered dose inhaler alone and once from a metered dose inhaler attached to a 750 ml <b>spacing</b> <b>device.</b> The 0900 h serum cortisol concentration was the same on the morning before each administration (468 nmol/l, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 390 - 561 nmol/l, day 1 v 479 nmol/l, 95 % CI 463 - 494 nmol/l, day 8). The 0900 h serum cortisol concentration the following morning, however, was lower when 2 mg beclomethasone dipropionate was given by metered dose inhaler alone (182 (95 % CI 128 - 264) nmol/l) than when it was given by a <b>spacing</b> <b>device</b> (363 (95 % CI 281 - 475) nmol/l). These results suggest that a large <b>spacing</b> <b>device</b> attached to a metered dose inhaler may decrease the risk of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal suppression by high dose inhaled steroid treatment...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: High {{doses of}} inhaled {{corticosteroids}} are absorbed systemically and may cause long term side effects. As rinsing the mouth out after use and inhaling through a <b>spacing</b> <b>device</b> may reduce systemic absorption {{this has been}} further investigated. METHODS: Three crossover {{studies were carried out}} to assess the effect of budesonide given by dry powder inhaler (Turbuhaler) with and without mouth rinsing and beclomethasone dipropionate given by metered dose inhaler with or without a <b>spacing</b> <b>device</b> (Volumatic) on serum cortisol concentrations and urinary cortisol excretion in patients with asthma taking an inhaled corticosteroid. Each treatment period was two weeks with in a two week washout period. Serum cortisol concentrations at 0800 hours on day 14 and the 24 hour urinary excretion of cortisol were measured. In study 1 24 patients taking beclomethasone dipropionate 500 micrograms twice a day inhaled with (n = 10) or without (n = 14) a Volumatic <b>spacing</b> <b>device</b> were switched to a budesonide dry powder inhaler, 600 micrograms to be taken twice a day without mouth rinsing. In study 2 10 patients took budesonide 800 micrograms twice a day with and without mouth rinsing and without swallowing the rinsing water. In study 3 17 patients took budesonide 800 micrograms twice daily with mouth rinsing and beclomethasone dipropionate 500 micrograms twice daily with the <b>spacing</b> <b>device</b> and mouth rinsing. RESULTS: In study 1 no difference was seen between budesonide without mouth rinsing and beclomethasone dipropionate without a spacer: beclomethasone with spacer caused less suppression of cortisol (mean (SD) serum cortisol concentration: beclomethasone and spacer 487 (148), budesonide 368 (145) nmol/l). In study 2 mouth rinsing caused less suppression of morning serum cortisol concentrations (rinsing 440 (63), no rinsing 375 (56) nmol/ 1). In study 3 {{there was no difference in}} serum or urinary cortisol concentrations between twice daily beclomethasone dipropionate 500 micrograms inhaled by Volumatic spacer or budesonide by Turbuhaler 800 micrograms twice daily, both with mouth rinsing. Individual serum cortisol values were within the normal range in all patients except one in study 1. CONCLUSION: Systemic absorption of a corticosteroid inhaled from a metered dose inhaler is reduced by using a <b>spacing</b> <b>device</b> and that from a dry powder inhaler by mouth rinsing...|$|E

40|$|The {{frequency}} spectrum offered by television white spaces provides an attractive solution to supplying extra bandwidth within large wireless local area networks or wireless backhaul links. However, {{it is still}} necessary to ensure for deployment purposes that the primary users, broadcasting services in this case, do {{not interfere with the}} white <b>space</b> <b>devices</b> but more importantly that the white <b>space</b> <b>devices</b> do not interfere with the television receivers or television re-transmitters.

For white <b>space</b> <b>devices</b> such as access points or backhaul links placed at a high height, use of horizontal polarization will reduce their vulnerability to interfere with the primary user regardless of what polarization it has, while also they will be less susceptible to interference from the primary user in locations where vertically polarized television transmitters are deployed...|$|R

40|$|Two GFC (Generic Flow Control) {{protocols}} {{are currently}} under study within the CCITT, namely the BT/NTT proposal and the Australian proposal. In this paper, their basic oper-ating principles are recalled. Then, {{since it has}} been recognized in earlier studies that Cell Delay Variation, or more precisely cell clumping, has {{a major impact on}} peak cell rate control performed in the Usage Parameter Control, a method for quantifying the magnitude of cell clumping in a cell stream is proposed. This method is subsequently applied for evaluating the magnitude of cell clumping introduced by the above GFC protocols. Although they provide for three priority levels, the analysis is carried out for one priority level only. Under the assumption that each tra c source transmits at its peak cell rate and that a cell <b>spacing</b> <b>device</b> is implemented in each Terminal Equipment, simulation results show that both GFC mechanisms are similar in terms of cell clumping. ...|$|E
40|$|When used in high doses, inhaled {{corticosteroids}} {{may cause}} {{suppression of the}} hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. The influence of the mode of drug inhalation {{on the degree of}} this suppression is not clear. Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal function was assessed by measurement of 0900 h serum cortisol concentrations, a short tetracosactrin test, and 24 hour urine free cortisol excretion in 48 adults with asthma taking 1500 - 2500 micrograms beclomethasone dipropionate daily via a metered dose aerosol. Twelve patients had hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal suppression, as judged by subnormal results from {{at least two of the}} three tests or (in one patient) by an abnormal insulin stress test response. These patients then changed to inhaling the same dose of beclomethasone dipropionate through a 750 ml spacer device (Volumatic). The endocrine tests were repeated from nine days to eight weeks later in 10 patients. Comparison with initial values showed that adding the <b>spacing</b> <b>device</b> caused an increase in the median 0900 h cortisol concentration from 126 nmol/l to 398 nmol/l, in the post-tetracosactrin cortisol concentration from 402 nmol/l to 613 nmol/l and in 24 hour urine free cortisol excretion from 54 nmol to 84 nmol. The rise in serum cortisol concentration in response to tetracosactrin did not change. Evidence of persisting hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression was present in only four of the 10 patients; the most pronounced improvements in function tended to occur in those who had never required long term oral corticosteroids. The results from this uncontrolled study suggest that asthmatic patients taking high dose beclomethasone dipropionate may minimise adverse effects by using a large volume spacer device...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether the inhaled corticosteroid budesonide, given by a Nebuhaler <b>spacing</b> <b>device,</b> was effective in prophylaxis of asthma in preschool children. DESIGN [...] Double blind, placebo controlled, random order crossover trial with two week practice run in period. SETTING [...] Outpatient clinic referrals in secondary referral centre. PATIENTS [...] 39 children aged 2 - 6 years selected for the following: able to use Nebuhaler; parents able to complete record card; poorly controlled asthma (defined); not already on systemic or inhaled steroids. Eleven withdrew for various reasons not connected with intolerance to budesonide. Age, sex, other atopies, and symptoms during run in period were similar in the 28 children who completed the trial and in the 11 who withdrew. INTERVENTIONS [...] Budesonide 200 micrograms or placebo (both one puff) given twice daily during 6 -week treatment or control periods, using Nebuhaler after prior training. Three week "washout" at crossover. Compliance monitored by weighing canisters. Patients withdrawn if their acute attacks required treatment with systemic steroids. END POINT [...] Control of asthma. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Peak expiratory flow rate measured twice daily where cooperation allowed. Diary of symptoms and concomitant drug use kept daily. Results showed mean peak flow significantly higher (12 % in mornings, 14 % in evenings) in second three weeks of intervention compared with control period (95 % confidence intervals 6. 3 - 17. 3 % and 7. 2 - 21. 0 %).

40|$|Abstract—Collective use of {{spectrum}} {{refers to}} a case where spectrum is accessible for independent users {{at the same time}} in a particular geographic location under a well-defined set of conditions. One example of collective spectrum use is the communication based on TV white spaces, which is emerging globally. Commercial operation is on-going in the United States and pilots are being deployed in Europe, Asia and Africa. During the operation of TV white <b>space</b> communications <b>devices</b> are not allowed to cause interference towards licensed incumbent uses, which are TV signals and wireless microphones. White <b>space</b> <b>devices</b> query allowed frequencies and transmission powers from the geolocation database. Here, we propose authentication architecture and protocol for two purposes: for the automatic registration for wireless microphones so that they can be protected by the geolocation database, and for the authentication of TV white <b>space</b> <b>devices</b> so that misbehaving use can be prevented. Third benefit of the proposed system is that frequency allocations are registered based on the real usage, which enhances spectrum utilization.

In the proposed cross-layer architecture, white <b>space</b> network <b>devices</b> such as white <b>space</b> <b>devices</b> and the spectrum map server cooperate to support the extended spectrum map, the inter-cell transmit power adaptation (ITPA), and the frequency-domain coexistence beacon (FCB). Upon the cross-layer architecture, firstly, white <b>space</b> <b>devices</b> (WSDs) achieve a faster search and higher accuracy in spectrum sensing with the extended spectrum map, the extended DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), and the FCB. Secondly, WSDs achieve the precise selection of their operating channel in spectrum decision with the extended spectrum map and the ITPA. In spectrum sharing, thirdly, the collaboration- based spectrum sharing with the ITPA achieve more accommodation of WSDs by {{increasing the number of}} channels shared between WSDs. Finally, WSDs with the FCB and the extended spectrum achieve effective spectrum mobility by obtaining the occupancy-status of channels precisely.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a common cause failure {{analysis}} (CCF) for <b>space</b> <b>devices.</b> This analysis belongs among dependability analyses, which have not been sufficiently developed {{in a field of}} space industry in corresponding technical and normative documents. Therefore, we focused on devising a new procedure of a qualitative and quantitative common cause failure analysis for the space applications herein. This new procedure of the qualitative and quantitative CCF analysis was applied on redundant systems of a special <b>space</b> <b>device</b> microaccelerometer (ACC), which was developed in VZLÚ. Performance of the qualitative CCF analysis can lead to recommendations to change design of the system, making the system less susceptible to the common cause failures. Performance of the quantitative CCF analysis and its inclusion into the computation of the system reliability can lead to a more accurate estimation of the reliability (in most cases it leads to decreasing the system reliability). During the development of the ACC there were not defined any requirements to perform the CCF analysis within general dependability requirements (defined by the customer and by ECSS standards). Hence, we compared computations of the ACC reliability with and without considering the CCFs. When the CCFs were considered, the reliability of the ACC was decreased according to our assumption. On our example of the ACC we showed advantages of the performance of the CCF analysis within the dependability analyses during development of the <b>space</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is the study of}} {{techniques}} for efficient management and use of the spectrum based on cognitive radio technology. The ability of cognitive radio technologies to adapt to the real-time conditions of its operating environment, offers the potential for more flexible use of the available spectrum. In this context, the international interest is particularly focused on the “white spaces” in the UHF band of digital terrestrial television. Spectrum sensing and geo-location database have been considered in order to obtain information on the electromagnetic environment. Different methodologies have been considered in order to investigate spectral resources potentially available for the white <b>space</b> <b>devices</b> in the TV band. The adopted methodologies are based on the geo-location database approach used either in autonomous operation or in combination with sensing techniques. A novel and computationally efficient methodology for the calculation of the maximum permitted white <b>space</b> <b>device</b> EIRP is then proposed. The methodology is suitable for implementation in TV white space databases. Different Italian scenarios are analyzed in order to identify both the available spectrum and the white <b>space</b> <b>device</b> emission limits. Finally two different applications of cognitive radio technology are considered. The first considered application is the emergency management. The attention is focused on the consideration of both cognitive and autonomic networking approaches when deploying an emergency management system. The cognitive technology is then considered in applications related to satellite systems. In particular a hybrid cognitive satellite-terrestrial is introduced and an analysis of coexistence between terrestrial and satellite networks by considering a cognitive approach is performed. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{thorough}} {{literature review}} {{of the effects of}} channel shape and <b>spacing</b> <b>devices</b> on post-dryout heat transfer has been performed. Overall, very little information is available for these effects, several experiments were carried out covering only limited flow conditions and geometries. To extend the present review, studies with air flow through heated channels have also been included. The effect of channel shape is small for channels with rounded corners, but is rather significant for those with sharp corners (especially those of small apex angle). As a result, the heat transfer rate is much lower in a triangular than a rectangular channel at the same flow conditions (the heat transfer rate in tubes is often the highest). In addition, the circumferential heat flux distribution affects the overall heat transfer rate considerably (e. g., comparing triangular channels with either one-side or all-side heated). A strong effect of <b>spacing</b> <b>devices</b> on heat transfer has been observed in both single-phase and post-dryout studies. It enhances significantly the heat transfer rate at locations downstream of the spacer. Most studies showed an exponentially decaying trend of heat transfer enhancement with increasing distance away from the spacer. Correlations have been proposed to represent this trend; they can only be applied to specific range of flow conditions due to the limited database. In view of the deficiency among existing prediction methods, correlations for the effects of channel shape and <b>spacing</b> <b>devices</b> on post-dryout heat transfer have been developed to improve the prediction accuracy and range of applications. These correlations provide good agreement with experimental data obtained in other studies. Furthermore, they exhibit correct asymptotic and parametric trends and hence can be extrapolated to conditions beyond the present database.
