In the present work we have studied the variation of dielectric constant with temperature of <b>Sodium</b> <b>Dihydrogen</b> <b>Orthophosphate.</b> During our investigation it is found that the temperature variation of the dielectric constant in heating cycle shows a very sharp jump in the dielectric constant, where the compound attains value from its value of 5600 to 42000 at 0 the temperature of 42 C (Fig. 1 & 2) which again falls in temperature range of 46 C to 51 C. The cooling curve has nearly same nature, but has moderately low value of dielectric constant and also the peaks are less sharp. Sharp rise in the dielectric constant have been explained on the basis of activated polarization process and ferroelectric 0 0 transition at 46 C while the initial fluctuations in dielectric constant between 27 C to 46 0 C is due to the structural imbalance occurred by the elimination of water molecule from the compound. The occurrence of broad peak in is explained on the basis of relaxor systems which are generally due to heterovalent disorder.

Stabilisers evaluated were sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP), trisodium citrate (TSC), {{disodium hydrogen orthophosphate}} (DSHP), and <b>sodium</b> <b>dihydrogen</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> (SDHP). With no added stabiliser, goats' milk produced a heavy sediment on UHT treatment. Addition of SDHP reduced pH, {{had little effect on}} ionic calcium and did not substantially reduce sediment. However, addition of SHMP, DSHP and TSC each reduced ionic calcium, increased ethanol stability and reduced sediment. Following stabiliser additions, there was a good correlation between ethanol stability and ionic calcium (R- 2 = 0. 85) but not between ethanol stability and pH (R- 2 = 0. 08). Overall, reducing ionic calcium reduced the amount of sediment formed for all these three stabilisers, although there was no single trend line between sediment formation and ionic calcium concentration. Sediment formation was not well correlated with pH for TSC or for SHMP, but it was for DSHP, making it the only stabiliser where sediment formation correlated well both with ionic calcium and pH, which might account for its effectiveness at higher ionic calcium levels. Sediment was much reduced when the temperature was reduced from 140 degrees C to 125 degrees C and 114 degrees C. There were no further changes in sediment on storage for two weeks. Analysis of the sediment showed that it was predominantly fat and protein, with a mass ratio ranging between 1. 43 : 1 and 1. 67 : 1. Its mineral content was usually less than 5 % of dry weight.
