5|$|In 2003, two {{producers}} optioned {{the rights}} to create a live-action film based on Metroid, but the rights expired. John Woo acquired the rights a few years later, and Lion Rock Productions was to produce and release the film before 2006, but it either has been canceled or remains in limbo. Sakamoto has expressed no interest in working on a Metroid movie himself, but stated he could support <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> by Ryuji Kitaura, director of the CG scenes in Other M, if the concept and methodologies were good enough.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, when Manchester United Football Club {{owned the}} Manchester Giants, Manchester's {{basketball}} franchise, there were {{plans to build}} a 9,000-seater indoor arena on the site of what is now Car Park E1. However, the chairman at the time, Martin Edwards, did not have the funds to take on <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>project,</b> and the basketball franchise was eventually sold. In August 2009, the car park became home to the Hublot clock tower, a -tall tower {{in the shape of the}} Hublot logo, which houses four -diameter clock faces, the largest ever made by the company.|$|E
5|$|Potter {{had long}} wanted {{to develop a}} book of nursery rhymes, but <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> left Warne cold. Rhymes were already well {{represented}} in the firm's catalogue, and Warne felt Potter's unbridled enthusiasm for the genre would make the project a headache for him. In the past, {{he had tried to}} discourage Potter's interest in rhymes, believing her own stories superior, but she persisted. He reluctantly agreed to a book of rhymes for 1905, but Potter did not have it ready at the end of 1904, so he accepted the tea party tale instead. Early in 1905, it was decided the book would be published {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E

5|$|Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, at Pierce's request, led surveys {{with the}} Corps of Topographical Engineers of {{possible}} transcontinental railroad routes throughout the country. The Democratic Party had long rejected federal appropriations for internal improvements, but Davis felt that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> could be justified as a Constitutional national security objective. Davis also deployed the Army Corps of Engineers to supervise construction {{projects in the}} District of Columbia, including {{the expansion of the}} United States Capitol and building of the Washington Monument.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Malaya {{received}} {{its independence from}} Britain {{as part of their}} decolonisation process in that region. The British government, in their reorganisation of the region following their departure, sought to combine Malaya with Singapore and the states of Sarawak, North Borneo, and Brunei to form a new 'Malaysian Federation.' This would serve British interests in these regions, particularly military basing rights, which they hoped the Malaysians would protect. Indonesia, however, and in particular President Sukarno, was fiercely opposed to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>project.</b> Sukarno, who was leaning ever closer towards the Communist bloc of China and Russia, despised the 'imperialist' British, and had planned to incorporate the latter three regions, all of which are located on the northern tip of Borneo, with the Indonesian-controlled territory of Kalimantan, which makes up the vast majority of that island. Sukarno determined to begin a military Confrontation with Malaysia, which through a series of raids and supported revolts might improve Indonesia's position in negotiating for the island.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, the {{hurricane}} left quasi-permanent alterations on beaches and small islands. For example, North Bunces Key—an island of southern Pinellas County—lost {{most of its}} vegetation to the storm, and overwashing shifted {{the southern part of}} the island up to 330ft (100 m) from its original settlement. More extensive changes were seen on and near Caladesi Island, which formed in 1921 after a hurricane split a larger barrier island into two by a new channel. The inlet became dominant over Dunedin Pass to the south, which grew narrower very gradually until Elena rearranged the dynamics of the beach, allowing Dunedin Pass to fill completely with sand within a couple years of {{the hurricane}}'s passage. As a result, Clearwater Beach became connected to Caladesi Island. Elena also created a new inlet known as Willy's Cut, which existed until 1991. Interest in artificially reopening Dunedin Pass prompted an official study in 1994 on the engineering and financial merits of <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>project.</b> Due to the high cost of dredging and the likelihood of nearly continuous maintenance, no action was taken.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, the Environment Agency {{constructed}} a tidal barrier {{at the mouth}} of the river. The structure spans the river, and a huge steel gate, weighing 202 tonnes, can be lowered into the waterway, effectively sealing the river from the Humber, and preventing tidal surges from moving up the river and flooding parts of the city and the low-lying areas beyond. The gate is lowered between eight and twelve times a year, and protects around 17,000 properties. In 2009, a £10million upgrade of the structure was started, to ensure it would stay operational for a further 30 years. The upgrade included a new drive mechanism, which raises and lowers the gate, and pivots it when it is at the top of the structure, so that it lies horizontally rather than vertically. It also included a new control system. In July 2017 the barrier was granted Grade II listed status. Plans have been considered to build a barrage {{at the mouth of}} the Hull where it joins the Humber Estuary to maintain a constant water level as it passes through the city. The idea was first raised by the Abercrombie report, which considered how to redevelop Hull after significant destruction during the Second World War. The estimated cost of <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> was around £195million in 2007.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, City Controller Hacker {{proposed}} a north-south subway running from Avenue Road and St. Clair Avenue south to Front and York streets, making a wide loop via Front, Scott, Victoria and Gerrard streets. The TTC rejected this proposal {{saying there was}} insufficient population to justify <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>project.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{researchers}} {{think that}} their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with artificial general intelligence, combining all the skills mentioned above and even exceeding human ability in most or all these areas. A few believe that anthropomorphic features like artificial consciousness or an artificial brain may be required for <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>project.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Ukrainian, Russian-speaking blogger Danylo Vakhovskyi {{said that}} he is {{consciously}} using Russian internet services {{and will continue to do}} so, because it is a way to support [...] "creation of favorable environment for entrepreneurship" [...] in Russia. Although, it is [...] "not patriotic, but to support entrepreneurs “with ruble”, is to give opportunity for new projects development, that is changing world for the better”.

25|$|As to {{condition}} four, the high priority {{allocated to the}} Manhattan Project allowed for the recruitment and concentration of capable scientists on the project.

25|$|Also in 1963, a new shareholder, Richard Barnaby, {{initiated}} {{talks with}} Major Tony Rolt of Ferguson Developments over {{the possibility of}} creating a four-wheel drive V8-powered TVR. Barnaby asked David Hives to create the chassis for such a car, which he did, although TVR {{did not have the}} funds available to commit to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> in full.

25|$|Excessive {{stream bank}} erosion may cause {{flooding}} and property damage.

25|$|Central Bedfordshire Council (then Bedfordshire County Council) {{acquired}} the old church in 1977. The site continued {{to suffer from}} vandalism, as well as fly-tipping, under Council ownership. In 2010, local activism led to plans {{for the church to}} acquire a new function. It was proposed to convert it into a bothy to provide overnight accommodation for walkers on the Bedfordshire Greensand Ridge walk, with a full-time warden on site. However, there were concerns that the Council {{would not be able to}} afford the £75,000 that it would have to spend on <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>project.</b>|$|E
25|$|Community members {{believed}} the restructuring {{by the government}} was targeted specifically at the City of Lethbridge, a move made to force the province to build an additional Lethbridge high school. <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> had been anticipated {{for at least a}} decade. As expected, the announcement for the new school came in 2005. Enrollment at LCI exceeded 1,600 students. In an effort to reduce numbers, students living on the City's north side who attend LCI must be enrolled in a course not offered at Winston Churchill High School.|$|E
50|$|Milestones are tools used in project {{management}} to mark specific points along <b>a</b> <b>project</b> timeline.
