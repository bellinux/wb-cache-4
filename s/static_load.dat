5|$|Construction of a {{full-scale}} mockup {{was completed in}} June 1945 by Factory No. 81, but the order for five prototypes was given to Factory No. 381 as Factory No. 81 was already fully committed to other programs. Manufacturing drawings were delivered to Factory No. 381 {{by the end of}} August, but the prototypes were delayed because the plant had no experience building metal aircraft and lacked the necessary tooling. By the end of the year, the factory had only managed to complete a single airframe for <b>static</b> <b>load</b> testing. This showed that the rear fuselage, wings and tail needed to be reinforced, and the opportunity was taken to enlarge the vertical stabilizer as well. These tests and modifications required six months of work so that the first flying prototype was not completed until July 1946. Manufacturer's testing of the first prototype began on 27 August, after ground testing had required replacing the engine twice, and the first flight was made on 11 September.|$|E

Because it tracks {{conditions on the}} failure plane, it also provides close fits for the post failure region of sensitive clays and silts something that other theories {{are not able to}} do. Additionally DSSM explains key relationships in soil mechanics that to date have simply been taken for granted, for example, why normalized undrained peak shear strengths vary with the log of the over consolidation ratio and why stress–strain curves normalize with the initial effective confining stress; and why in one-dimensional consolidation the void ratio must vary with the log of the effective vertical stress, why the end-of-primary curve is unique for <b>static</b> <b>load</b> increments, and why the ratio of the creep value Cα to the compression index Cc must be approximately constant {{for a wide range of}} soils..|$|E

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is constructed}} entirely from 6061-T6 aluminium tubing, bolted together with aircraft-grade AN hardware {{and covered with}} 3.9 oz/yd² (132 g/m²) Dacron. The covering includes zippers to facilitate inspection. The structure was <b>static</b> <b>load</b> tested to +6/-3 g. The fuselage is built on a [...] central [...] "spinal" [...] tube that supports the cockpit and the tail surfaces. The cockpit is of a unique pentagonal cross-section that provides a very wide [...] cabin at hip level. The upper cockpit tubing curves down to the aircraft's nose {{at a ratio of}} 3:1 to provide a compromise between internal cockpit space and streamlining and gives the Chinook its distinctive profile.|$|E
2500|$|The {{project had}} a long and {{difficult}} gestation— {{while it was still}} being built, original owner Kenneth Reiner (with whom Lautner collaborated closely) was bankrupted by the fraudulent dealings of his business partners and he was forced to sell the house. Lautner also faced opposition from the Los Angeles building certification authorities, who were dismayed by the radical design of the post-stressed concrete ramp, which cantilivers out {{from the base of the}} house without any columns supporting it from beneath, and is only four inches thick. Not surprisingly, the Los Angeles building inspector demanded a <b>static</b> <b>load</b> test to prove that it could take the weight of a car— a standoff that mirrored Lautner and Wright's earlier contretemps with skeptical building authorities who demanded load tests on Wright's famous [...] "lotus pad" [...] columns for the Johnson Wax Building. In the event, Lautner's load calculations proved flawless and in fact the instruments recorded more deflection in the concrete from the change in temperature when the sun went down than they did from the weight of the sandbags loaded onto the ramp to test it. The project then sat unfinished for some time. When it became available through bankruptcy in 1974, Philip and Jacklyn Burchill bought the home. They worked with Lautner to complete the home and moved in 1976.|$|E
40|$|Abstract A set {{of stress}} state {{dependent}} failure loci of a talc-filled Polypropylene material under <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> and dynamic loading {{was obtained by}} using a combined experimental-numerical approach. Uniaxial tension, simple shear, notched tension and punching tests were carried out to identify fracture locus under nonnegative stress triaxiality. Corresponding finite element analysis was performed to obtain the evolution of stress triaxiality of each failure element in each type of test. Different fracture prediction techniques were applied in <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> and dynamic loading, respectively. Under dynamic loading, an average value of the stress triaxiality was identified to determine stress triaxiality of critical point during the whole loading process in each type of test. By comparing force-displacement curves from both test and modeling, equivalent plastic strain in identified stress triaxiality can be obtained. Under <b>static</b> <b>loading,</b> damage evolution rule was utilized to optimize failure locus, and quadratic function was selected to optimize fracture locus. Significant difference of fracture locus between <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> and dynamic loading was observed...|$|R

In this study, a three-dimensional finite-element model was established to investigate the development of soil arching during the construction and <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> test on an embankment. The model was verified by comparing the variations in earth pressure on the pile cap with the measured data from well-instrumented full-scale model tests. A good agreement was found between the computed and measured data.

40|$|Background: For implant-supported hybrid prostheses, high {{mastication}} {{forces and}} reduced acrylic resin thickness over a metal substructure often cause failures arising from tooth or resin fractures. To assay fracture resistance of artificial teeth and resin in implant-supported hybrid prostheses {{in relation to}} the titanium structure and retention design supporting teeth. Material and Methods: 40 specimens bearing incisors were divided into four groups according to the titanium structure supporting the teeth and the type of load force applied: Group I (Control; n= 10) : Application of <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> to ten incisors set over a metal structure with internal retention. Group II (Control; n= 10) : Application of <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> to ten incisors set over a metal structure with external retention. The remaining study specimens (n= 20) were subjected to 120, 000 masticatory and thermal cycles in a chewing simulator. Afterwards, <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> was applied until the point of fracture using an Instron machine.

Results: Statistical analysis confirmed that there were significant differences in fracture resistance between the four groups. External retention was found to have more fracture resistance than the internal retention. Conclusions: Hybrid prostheses with titanium substructures and external retention obtained significantly better results than samples with internal retention...|$|R
