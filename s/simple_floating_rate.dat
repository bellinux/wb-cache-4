50|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>rate</b> {{loans are}} common in the banking {{industry}} and for large corporate customers. A <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> mortgage is a mortgage with a <b>floating</b> <b>rate,</b> {{as opposed to a}} fixed rate loan.|$|R
50|$|<b>Floating</b> rate: <b>Floating</b> <b>rate</b> is {{a rate of}} {{interest}} that varies over time with the prime rate. If you negotiate a <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> with your loan providers, the interest you are charged during repayment of your loan will increase and decrease along with the prime rate. The Loan Repayment Estimator uses a <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> of prime + 2.5%. For example, if the prime <b>rate</b> is 4.5%, <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> on the Loan Repayment Estimator will be 7% (4.5% + 2.5% = 7%).|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} {{discussion}} {{is the use of}} Interest Rate Derivatives by non-financial firms in the UK. The data of the non-financial firms is gathered from the information available in the financial statements. The objective {{of the study was to}} analyse how firms use <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> debts or fixed rate debts to hedge their interest rate risk. It is found that bank debts for nonfinancial firms is set on a <b>floating</b> <b>rate,</b> firms with higher cash holdings choose to have more <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> debt, firms with high leverage prefer to have fixed rate debts, firms manage the volatility in their earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) using <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> debts and firms with credit ratings usually desire for a fixed rate debt. The findings for these independent variables is found to be consistent with existing literature. However, tests for the effects of firm size, short-term debt and long-term debts on the <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> debt were futile since they did not yield statistically significant results...|$|R

50|$|The {{two basic}} types of amortized loans are the fixed rate {{mortgage}} (FRM) and adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) (also {{known as a}} <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> or variable rate mortgage). In some countries, such as the United States, fixed rate mortgages are the norm, but <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> mortgages are relatively common. Combinations of fixed and <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> mortgages are also common, whereby a mortgage loan will have a fixed rate for some period, for example the first five years, and vary {{after the end of}} that period.|$|R

5000|$|In many countries, <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> {{loans and}} {{mortgages}} are predominant. They may be referred to by different names, such as an adjustable rate mortgage in the United States. In some countries, {{there may be no}} special name for this type of loan or mortgage, as <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> lending may be the norm. For example, in Canada substantially all mortgages are <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> mortgages; borrowers may choose to [...] "fix" [...] the interest rate for any period between six months and ten years, although the actual term of the loan may be 25 years or more.|$|R
40|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>rate</b> {{bonds are}} coupon-paying {{instruments}} generally indexed to interest parameters. At the trading date, the payment dates and indexation rules are known, while {{the value of}} future coupons is uncertain. In this perspective, <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> bonds are generally seen as a portfolio of zero coupon bonds. Therefore, at each coupon payment date, the bond should be quoted at face value and its duration should match the maturity of the replicating zero coupon bond. However, the empirical evidence based on historical prices of real <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> bonds shows that such an instrument is not systematically quoted at parity and its market risk profile could differ {{from that of the}} replicating zero coupon bond. The aim of this work is to study the duration of a <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> bond using a partial modified duration approach after decomposing the <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> bond into its main building blocks. The final goal is to capture the effective risk factors of these instruments in real financial markets in order to define synthetic risk measures that should be able to reflect the instrument’s effective risk profile...|$|R

5000|$|In {{business}} and finance, a <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> loan (or a variable or adjustable rate loan) {{refers to a}} loan with a <b>floating</b> interest <b>rate.</b> The total rate paid by the customer [...] "floats" [...] in relation to some base rate, to which a spread or margin is added (or more rarely, subtracted). The term of the loan may be substantially longer than the basis from which the <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> loan is priced; for example, a 25-year mortgage may be priced off the 6-month prime lending rate.|$|R
50|$|Bonds {{typically}} {{pay interest}} at set intervals. Bonds with fixed coupons divide the stated coupon into parts defined by their payment schedule, for example, semi-annual pay. Bonds with <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> coupons have set calculation schedules where the <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> is calculated {{shortly before the}} next payment. Zero-coupon bonds do not pay interest. They are issued at a deep discount {{to account for the}} implied interest.|$|R

In contrast to fixed rate securities, the rates on “floaters” will periodically adjust up or down according to a designated index such as a U.S. Treasury rate, or, more typically, the London Interbank Offered <b>Rate</b> (LIBOR). The <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> usually reflects the movement in the index plus an additional fixed margin to cover the added risk.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to find the determinants of the fixed and <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> debt mix by using a comprehensive dataset of UK non financial firms. The UK provides a particularly valuable for empirical investigation since it has a large and sophisticated corporate sector. Additionally UK firms have become more exposed to different types of risk because of the increasing level of debts commitments, expanding to international operations. Lack of consensus of the economic effects of the fixed and <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> debt mix decision {{as well as the}} limited research on this issue in the UK intrigued the author and led to this research into whether the UK evidence enhance the theories of capital structure. In this way the thesis contributes to the ongoing debate in the literature and provides a valuable additional case study. The thesis also contributes by giving insights into the determinants of the fixed and floating debt mix across firms {{over a period of time}} (1999 - 2004). One of the main contributions of this study is that the evidence presented suggests that the fixed and <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> debt are heterogeneous when the determinants of the capital structure is examined. Also firms are mainly hedging when determining the <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> debt. Firms considering foreign debt and <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> debt are mainly using foreign currency derivatives to hedge their exchange rate risk. In undertaking this analysis, a systematic empirical approach is taken which employs essentially the econometric methodologies by using the panel data...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{chronicles the}} {{evolution}} of Canada's exchange rate regimes, from the (particularly rigid) gold standard of the early 19 th century to today's <b>floating</b> <b>rates,</b> emphasizing the factors that influenced the choice and characteristics of those regimes. We argue that Canada's historical experience can provide a laboratory for analyzing exchange rate policy proposals: those advocating that Canada join a common currency area must address the difficulties that Canada experienced with fixed exchange rates in the past; those in favour of a <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> must explain how the system can achieve the stability associated with the <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> of the 1950 s rather than the policy problems of the 1980 s.

5000|$|An inverse <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> note can {{be created}} two ways. The first is by placing an {{existing}} or newly underwritten fixed-rate security into a trust and issuing both a <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> note and an inverse <b>floating</b> <b>rate</b> note. The second method is for an investment banking firm to underwrite a fixed-rate security and then enter into an interest rate swap that has a maturity less than the bond's term. The investor would then own an inverse floater until the swap agreement expires. When creating an inverse floater through the swap market the need to sell in inverse floaters through a Dutch auction is eliminated. In the first scenario the original security placed in trust {{is referred to as}} the collateral, from this collateral both the floater and inverse floater are created. The dealer will split up the underlying fixed-rate asset at a specified ratio (e.g. 20/80) and assign each portion to inverse and floater.|$|R
