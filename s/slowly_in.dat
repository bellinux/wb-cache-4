5|$|Ytterbium metal tarnishes <b>slowly</b> <b>in</b> air. Finely {{dispersed}} ytterbium readily oxidizes in air {{and under}} oxygen. Mixtures of powdered ytterbium with polytetrafluoroethylene or hexachloroethane burn with a luminous emerald-green flame. Ytterbium reacts with hydrogen to form various non-stoichiometric hydrides. Ytterbium dissolves <b>slowly</b> <b>in</b> water, but quickly in acids, liberating hydrogen gas.|$|E
5|$|Limited by {{poor quality}} {{locomotives}} and the bumpy, cheaply laid track which followed {{the contours of}} the hills, trains ran very <b>slowly</b> <b>in</b> the area; in 1882 trains took 20 minutes to travel the short distance from Quainton Road to Westcott, and 50 minutes from Westcott to Brill.|$|E
5|$|Manganese is a silvery-gray {{metal that}} resembles iron. It is hard and very brittle, {{difficult}} to fuse, but easy to oxidize. Manganese metal and its common ions are paramagnetic. Manganese tarnishes <b>slowly</b> <b>in</b> air and oxidizes ("rusts") like iron in water containing dissolved oxygen.|$|E

5|$|Ytterbium is a soft, {{malleable}} and ductile {{chemical element}} that displays a bright silvery luster when pure. It {{is a rare}} earth element, and it is readily dissolved by the strong mineral acids. It reacts slowly with cold water and it oxidizes <b>slowly</b> <b>in</b> air.|$|E
5|$|After the {{successful}} defence of Wau the 3rd Division began advancing towards Salamaua in April 1943. This advance was mounted {{to divert attention}} from Lae, {{which was one of the}} main objectives of Operation Cartwheel, and proceeded <b>slowly.</b> <b>In</b> late June the 3rd Division was reinforced by the US 162nd Regimental Combat Team which staged an amphibious landing to the south of Salamaua. The town was eventually captured on 11 September 1943.|$|E
5|$|Another issue {{concerned}} {{the election of}} the president. Few agreed with Madison that the executive should be elected by the legislature. There was widespread concern with direct election, because information diffused so <b>slowly</b> <b>in</b> the late 18th century, and because of concerns that people would only vote for candidates from their state or region. A vocal minority wanted the national executive to be chosen by the governors of the states.|$|E

5|$|Mendeleev further {{predicted}} that eka-aluminium would be discovered {{by means of}} the spectroscope, and that metallic eka-aluminium would dissolve <b>slowly</b> <b>in</b> both acids and alkalis and would not react with air. He also {{predicted that}} M2O3 would dissolve in acids to give MX3 salts, that eka-aluminium salts would form basic salts, that eka-aluminium sulfate should form alums, and that anhydrous MCl3 should have a greater volatility than ZnCl2: all of these predictions turned out to be true.|$|E
5|$|One stew {{that may}} be served with {{couscous}} is the Moroccan tagine, a hearty, somewhat dry dish of meat and vegetables, cooked <b>slowly</b> <b>in</b> a pot (called a tagine) with a tall conical lid. Dishes from the Maghreb region of North Africa are often coloured and flavoured with the hot spice mixtures harissa and ras el hanout (containing such spices as cumin, coriander, saffron, cinnamon, cloves, chillies, and paprika). Other characteristic flavourings of the region are preserved lemons and dried apricots and raisins.|$|E
5|$|Ophelia moved {{extremely}} <b>slowly</b> <b>in</b> {{and around}} North Carolina, causing the storm to drop more than 10inches (254mm) of rain on many coastal areas. The highest amount measured was from Oak Island, where 17.5inches (445mm) was registered. In addition, storm surges of 7–12feet (2–4m) were recorded, particularly in low-lying inlets of Pamlico Sound. At the storm's peak, over 240,000 customers were without power in coastal North Carolina. One indirect fatality was reported {{due to a}} traffic accident related to Ophelia, although no direct deaths were recorded.|$|E

5|$|Palladium is a soft silver-white {{metal that}} resembles {{platinum}}. It {{is the least}} dense and has the lowest melting point of the platinum group metals. It is soft and ductile when annealed and is greatly increased in strength and hardness when cold-worked. Palladium dissolves <b>slowly</b> <b>in</b> concentrated nitric acid, in hot, concentrated sulfuric acid, and when finely ground, in hydrochloric acid. It dissolves readily at room temperature in aqua regia.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia levis {{is rarely}} seen in cultivation, {{mainly because of}} {{difficulties}} in propagation; seed germination is unpredictable, and cuttings have been nearly impossible to strike. Nevertheless, its colourful bark and leaves are attractive horticultural features. Well-drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for the plant in a garden situation. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells and grows fairly readily, albeit <b>slowly,</b> <b>in</b> suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England germinated seed as early as 1795.|$|E
5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} is {{a disorder}} {{that results in}} pain in the heel {{and bottom of the}} foot. The pain is usually most severe with the first steps of the day or following a period of rest. Pain is also frequently brought on by bending the foot and toes up towards the shin and may be worsened by a tight Achilles tendon. The condition typically comes on <b>slowly.</b> <b>In</b> about a third of people both legs are affected.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the United States' Civil War, Catholicism grew <b>slowly</b> <b>in</b> America, but afterward, {{it became}} more {{widespread}} as Catholic immigrants from eastern Europe moved to the four counties, which include Armstrong, Fayette, Indiana, and Westmoreland, to mine coal and produce coke to fire steel mills in Pittsburgh. This influx of Catholic immigrants resulted {{in the creation of}} more than 80 parishes and missions in the counties between 1865 and 1917.|$|E
5|$|Scandium is a {{soft metal}} with a silvery appearance. It {{develops}} a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when oxidized by air. It {{is susceptible to}} weathering and dissolves <b>slowly</b> <b>in</b> most dilute acids. It does not react with a 1:1 mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and 48% hydrofluoric acid (HF), possibly due {{to the formation of}} an impermeable passive layer. Scandium turnings ignite in air with a brilliant yellow flame to form scandium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} grew <b>slowly</b> <b>in</b> the 17th century: St. John's was Newfoundland's largest settlement when English naval officers {{began to take}} censuses around 1675. The {{population grew}} in the summers {{with the arrival of}} migratory fishermen. In 1680, fishing ships (mostly from South Devon) set up fishing rooms at St. John's, bringing hundreds of Irish men into the port to operate inshore fishing boats.|$|E

5|$|Up to {{the mid-19th}} century {{members of the local}} Slav {{population}} did not identify themselves as members of larger ethnolinguistic entities. In Cieszyn Silesia (as in all West Slavic borderlands) various territorial identities pre-dated ethnic and national identity. Consciousness of membership within a greater Polish or Czech nation spread <b>slowly</b> <b>in</b> Silesia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} racing lap, Vettel led by 2.8 seconds from Webber, who was {{followed}} by Alonso, Rosberg, Hamilton, Massa, Button, Schumacher, Kubica, Hülkenberg, Sutil, Barrichello, Kobaysahi, Heidfeld, Alguersari, Liuzzi, Buemi, Glock, Petrov, Kovalainen, Yamamoto, Trulli, Senna and di Grassi. Alonso chose a cautious approach and lost four to five seconds while building up his pace <b>slowly</b> <b>in</b> the early stages. Sutil ran off the circuit but continued after losing his position to both Williams drivers. Webber lost grip on the next lap after running across the outside kerbing and spinning across the track onto the wall between turns twelve and thirteen; he slid back onto the circuit and collected Rosberg, forcing both drivers to retire. The debris on-track from the accident called the safety car to be deployed. Kobayashi, Petrov, Heidfeld and Buemi all made pit stops for intermediate tyres during the safety car period.|$|E
5|$|Beatty's {{population}} grew <b>slowly</b> <b>in</b> {{the first half}} of the 20thcentury, rising from 169 in 1929 to 485 in 1950. The first reliable electric company in the community, Amargosa Power Company, began supplying electricity in about 1940. Phone service arrived during World War II, and the town installed a community-wide sewer system in the 1970s. When a new mine opened west of Beatty in 1988, the population briefly surged from about 1,000 to between 1,500 and 2,000 by the end of 1990. Since the mine's closing in 1998, the population has fallen again to near its former level.|$|E
