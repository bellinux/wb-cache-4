5|$|For Lord Charlemont, Hogarth {{chose to}} paint the satirical Piquet, or Virtue in Danger (also known as The Lady's Last Stake, after a 1708 play by Colley Cibber), which, with echoes of Marriage à-la-Mode, shows an army officer {{offering}} an aristocratic lady a chance to recover the fortune she has just lost by gambling (with the implication that if she loses again, <b>she</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to take him as her lover).
