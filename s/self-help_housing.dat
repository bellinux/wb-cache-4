As demonstrated in this study, chengzhongcun accommodate, with {{little in the way of}} government resources and assistance, millions of rural migrants because of their social accessibility and affordability. While not denying their social problems, we argue that chengzhongcun in fact act as an innovative and positive agent to promote urbanization in present day China by housing massive numbers of rural migrants and assimilating them into cities. Current government policies towards chengzhongcun have generated a wide range of interest conflicts and confrontations. The consequences of such conflicts show that the government policies were problematic and unworkable, as they violated basic market principles as well as citizen rights. Policy strategy towards the redevelopment of chengzhongcun must acknowledge their credibility in the Chinese road to urbanization and requires more thoughtful and prudent consideration of migrants' demands for affordable housing.

30|$|Literature {{shows how}} access {{to land and}} regime type (whether {{democratic}} or authoritarian) {{has become part of}} distributive politics and clientilism in the housing of urban low-income groups in recent years. The use of land as ‘bait’, through election promises is well-documented (for example, Boone 2013). After the elections, the poor residents become subject to precariousness because there is no security of tenure guaranteed to them. The poor often collaborate to mobilize resources instrumental for their <b>self-help</b> projects <b>housing</b> included. With reference to India, the Ministry of Agriculture (2009 :iv) has argued that, “… the cooperative ability not only to help survival of the people but also of indirectly forcing the market to behave.” The cooperative approach by poor households hinges of the needs and aspirations of the members, a factor which makes them strong (internally) (Shankar 2002). Nevertheless, where cooperatives have existed, the political processes obtaining in their context usually control their influence. They are often apron-tied to the agenda of government. As observed by Birchall (2003 :ix), in the developing world, cooperatives “… have often been used as tools of development by governments that have not allowed them to become fully autonomous, member-owned businesses.” Indeed, there may be internal democracy in a cooperative but the politicians tend to try to exploit this internal strength of the cooperative to their advantage hence the imminence of a clientistic logic. Vote buying, patronage, and machine politics often define this logic.|$|R
40|$|Housing {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{problems}} facing human being. Yet housing {{is one of the}} three main human essential needs to life other being food and clothing. To date no single nation in the world has been able to provide its citizens with adequate housing. Inadequate housing has been mainly caused by limited resources due to the cost involved, which is always very high. Tanzania like many other developing countries is experiencing unabated high rate of rural urban migration. People are migrating to towns in search of employment opportunities, physical and social amenities and other services, which are abundant in towns as compared to rural areas. As a result of this, the housing shortage/problem emerged. The Government could not be able to solve this problem because of the merger financial resources available for many other pressing wants. Efforts by the Government to solve the problem through various projects proved futile. The most hit group of the population is the poor who do not own collaterals to secure loan from financial Institutions for own housing construction. Today the Government is reluctant to assist low income people to have access to their own housing. Instead the Government encourages CBOS, NGOS in collaboration with Local Authorities to address the matter. In view of the above change of Government housing policy to poor people, it is now suffice to say that <b>self-help</b> community based <b>housing</b> production is one way of solvinghousing due to lack of capital, expertise and guidance but they can participate fully by offering their labour force and other small contributions. <b>Self-help</b> community <b>housing</b> production should be supported by the government through various aspects; such as providing land/plots for housing construction, providing technical assistance, tax exemption to the building materials used in the construction process and training of the poor communities on the importance of self-help programs. As well as financial assistance in order to boost the financial problems facing poor families. Self help community based housing production has proved to be a solution to the housing problem facing poor people in many developing countries Tanzania not excluded. This research report will try to develop a proposal for program implementation to be partially financed by a Non Governmental not for profit organization dealing with poor communities in assisting to produce own simple, durable and decent housing, the Habitat for Humanity of Tanzania, at Mapinga village, Mpiji area in Bagamoyo District in order to enable its members about 297 to have access to decent accommodation through community self help housing production scheme.

If there are ten problem areas where people are facing stresses, like economic engagement, health, shelter, food, education, recreation, transport, etc., there must be a variety of opportunities through which individuals and households can resolve each of these stresses. There must be ten channels to resolve each of ten stresses! If this opportunity matrix is understood and responded to, the city is truly functioning as an opportunity matrix. For example, opportunities for shelter could be through the channels of lodges, rented rooms, studio apartments, bedroom apartments and houses. It could be through the channels of ownership, through a variety of tendencies. It could be through opportunities for <b>self-help,</b> or incremental <b>housing.</b> It could be through the up-gradation of slums.

The utilizing of these varied techniques would allow for an understanding of the current problems and would highlight the most suitable educational methods that would enable sustainable development. Community members participated in a training program designed to raise awareness of local problems and taught construction methods that would improve their buildings resistance to the harsh environment. By analyzing the changes in attitude and ability of the educational group after the training had taken place would enable the effectiveness of the self help training to be concluded. It also highlighted the importance that selecting and targeting participants played to achieve the ability and attitude necessary for the success of the sustainable development of the self help housing project. The research project also highlighted other barriers to sustainable development and a tourist approach has been considered relevant for the sustained development of housing as the geographical location and opportunities offered through a tourist circuit would complement the aspirations of the local community of Cerro Pelón.

40|$|The {{study is}} {{concerned}} with housing problems for low income groups in the Sudan, with special reference to the Capital. The analysis of the Capital's housing problem revealed a lack of a comprehensive housing policy or physical development plan. Haphazard land distributions systems exacerbated the rapid horizontal expansion of low density housing in the city. It was found that government sponsored housing assistance paradoxically tended to aid a highly paid elite. Lack of co-ordination between government units and departments concerned with housing policy resulted in wastage of limited public resources. The housing programme was further hindered by an inadequate modern building technology. Socially, the housing shortage has been worsened {{in recent years by}} a continuous rural migration resulting in an over concentration of wealth and employment opportunities in the Capital. The huge growth in illegal housing and squatter settlements was the predictable result of this trend. Lack of technical knowledge has resulted in the construction of housing with inadequate thermal control. Detailed thermal studies were carried out {{during the course of this}} study in order to determine optimum building orientation in Khartoum to achieve adequate standards of thermal comfort. Sudanese social traditions were considered to have a great influence on housing design. An analysis of these traditions was prepared including the use of multi functional open space to serve the complex social activities. The main objective of the Thesis was to arrive at an alternative solution to the housing problems. A study of non-profit and self- help housing techniques in housing development revealed a possible direction. Because of lack of both public and private finance, non-profit housing techniques were found to be the most appropriate for the Capital. Such techniques could cultivate the populations monetary and non-monetary resources. The solution proposed was twofold: 1) The establishment of adequate housing standards for non-profit housing associations catering for high and middle income groups. 2) <b>Self-help,</b> self-building <b>housing</b> for low income groups. The Capital's housing needs were projected to 1990 and a detailed building programme set out to achieve the resolution of these needs. Careful analysis of government expenditure suggested that, with the application of non-profit techniques, only a relatively modest public capital contribution was required to begin the diminution of the housing problem in the Sudan...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} critical role played by modern architecture and planning in shaping the discourse on Third World development after the Second World War. At stake here is an ignored dimension {{of the history of}} modern architecture and planning {{as well as that of}} the development discourse that sheds important light on the relationship of both these discourses to the trajectories of global domination and control. Critiques of development have largely focused on how the economic approaches proposed by international institutions such as the World Bank and the UN have favored the financial and political agendas of global industrial powers. This dissertation argues that design practices like architecture and planning-usually thought to be concerned only with shaping the physical environment-have also played a significant role in shaping the key assumptions of the development discourse, from the existence of urbanizing masses caught between demands of tradition and modernization to the exploding Third World city that is unable to manage its emergence into modernity. After the Second World War, as modern architecture began to lose its disciplinary footings as a medium of social reform in the industrialized world, modem architects and planners found tremendous opportunities as "experts" in programs of Third World development. The United Nations Housing Town and Country Planning section (HTCP), headed by Ernest Weissmann, a member of Congrns International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM), sent out hundreds of missions, featuring famous housing and planning names such as Charles Abrams, Otto Koenigsberger, Catherine Bauer, and Jacob Crane, among others. (cont.) These missions produced master plans for cities from Singapore (recounted most famously by Rem Koolhaas in SMLXL) to Kabul to Beirut to Lima to Lagos, organized numerous conferences, and set up planning and public administration bodies, building research centers, and schools of architecture all over the decolonizing world. This dissertation examines this wide range of activity to identify particular modes of social and economic intervention, such as <b>self-help</b> architecture, "core" <b>housing,</b> and regional planning, that were able to negotiate the demands of postcolonial nation-states, the Cold War geo-political context, and the agendas of institutions of international finance emerging after the war. by M.

The aim {{of this study is to}} answer the question of what kind of meanings human action has for citizens welfare in neighbourhood houses? The data is analysed and interpreted by the researcher as perceived and experienced by citizens. The researcher has participated in the inhabitants daily life in the neighbourhood houses and gathered data with residents in everyday context. Data collection consists of 330 pages of notes gathered by participative observation, informal conversations and interviews. Data consisted also of photographs, drawings and other background documents. In this study ethnography is understood as an experience with residents and learning from them. This study is taking a look at groups of citizens, whose action seem to be day to day life action in houses. Research data is analysed by human action theory. The concept of welfare seems to mean support to citizens everyday life, basic needs of living, personal growth, social action and doing together in neighbourhood houses. There are community based services in the municipal social services but they are often hidden. The point is, that in these places variety of citizens can get together in their own way. Residents come with their neighbours to meet other people also while not feeling too well. Some quiet groups of people found places many times a day. Citizens in houses create spontaneous voluntary work and <b>self-help</b> groups. Neighbourhood <b>houses</b> are working places for unemployed people but also working communities to citizens working at home. At its best, residents, employees and workers in neighbourhood houses are members of the community. Sometimes the border between paid and unpaid work gets confused. For example, some employees after period of employment continue to work voluntarely. The most common part of welfare, participation, seems not to be connected with residents position getting work, apartment or services, what they need. It appears that residents find place and permanent staff in neighbourhood houses as important resources, when welfare is not divided equally. In neighbourhood houses, residents recognize other groups of citizens and have dialogue about the position of residents who are inside or outside of their own community. As a part of welfare, social action and daily services by community work offers citizens important connection with organized social services. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|South East Alcohol Innovation Programme: {{evaluation}} report. Lundbeck UK Limited and Centre for Public Innovation, 2011. In {{the south}} east of England a bidding exercise spawned {{a spate of}} short-term innovative projects to reduce alcohol-related harm, from which five models were assessed as most promising and taken forward for further implementation and assessment the following year – a rapid and intensive test bed from which others can learn as well. Summary The South East Alcohol Innovation Programme was initiated by the Regional Alcohol Manager at the Government Office for the South East of England. From 2010 to 2011 it funded innovation activities in the public and voluntary sectors designed to reduce alcohol-related harm {{as measured by the}} level of alcohol-related hospital admissions, and to influence the adverse impact on population health and criminal justice challenges associated with violence and anti-social behaviour. Primary care trusts (which fund public health services) and their partners were encouraged to bid for £ 300, 000 to test out innovative approaches to meeting these objectives for between six and eight weeks. Successful bidders were encouraged to report the outcomes using a common framework. In year one the aim was to fund as many innovative ideas as possible to tackle alcohol-related hospital admissions. In all 26 projects were funded across three thematic grant rounds: • Seasonal alcohol campaigns; • High impact grant programmes; • Joint commissioner-provider pilots. Using 'innovation funnelling', these projects were then scored against several criteria to agree which would be taken forward. The top five which had the greatest impact were selected as models for the year two bidding round, which resulted in 10 projects running between December 2010 and April 2011. The five models are described below. The projects based on these models in year two may have varied somewhat from these models. Frequent flyers: A specialist community-based worker was appointed to work intensively with the 10 patients with the most alcohol-related repeat hospital admissions, to coordinate their care, reduce the impact on other services and ultimately reduce the likelihood of further admissions. Candidate patients were identified through medical assessment unit records and referred to the worker, who proactively contacted them and sought to engage them in a full assessment of their needs, linking with, and coordinating care and treatment from other specialist services. Offering dedicated care management was intended to achieve a more effective and coordinated approach to their treatment, freeing up the resources of those currently working with them in a more sporadic, unplanned way. Pharmacy brief advice: The aim was to engage with staff in community pharmacies to enable them to proactively offer brief advice on alcohol to their customers. Information for pharmacy staff covered health awareness, understanding units of alcohol, early identification of possible excess, data capture on awareness and units consumed, and signposting/referral for additional support where required. This aim was to raise awareness of what constitutes safe alcohol consumption amongst low and increasing risk customers unaware of how much they are drinking. Hostel clinical nurse: The project funded a clinician to provide clinical support and training for hostel staff to enable them to support previous rough sleepers who are dependent drinkers, with the aim of reducing their drinking and addressing attendant health problems. It extended the opportunities for alcohol-dependent residents to address their substance misuse as well as improve their mental and physical health, a group whose severe dependence and chaotic lives mean they tended not to access existing services. The project targeted drinkers for whom inpatient detoxification does not work, usually ending with a return to the hostel and resumed drinking, aiming to replace this cycle with personalised, gradual detoxification within the hostel environment. Supported <b>housing</b> <b>self-help</b> group: Using the vehicle of alcohol workshops, the project aimed to encourage the formation of a self-help group on drinking problems in a supported housing setting, addressing some of the issues which made residents reluctant to access specialist services while raising awareness of levels of alcohol consumption and how to reduce this to safer levels. The self-help format enabled participants to support one another, drawing on their own skills and experiences. By eliciting and identifying reasons for non-engagement with treatment services, group discussions helped put in place mechanisms to manage these obstacles. Brief intervention by hospital healthcare support workers: Healthcare support workers in accident and emergency, medical assessment unit and gastroenterology wards were trained in simple techniques to enable them to identify and briefly advise risky drinkers among the patients they came in to contact with. These workers contact all patients admitted and usually have more time than nursing and other medical staff. They were trained how to screen and advise patients while performing basic care tasks, effectively delivering information at a time of crisis for the patient in a way which it was hoped would affect their drinking and reduce repeat admissions for alcohol-related conditions...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{tries to}} present a critical analysis of conflicts over contested forms of urban transformation and urban policies {{in the metropolitan area}} of Rome and Berlin (comparative analysis developed in co-tutoring research thesis). In particular it focuses on the reclaiming of the “right to the city” debate that is witnessing a renewed interest, among urban social movements and academics, due to what happened in the streets, among the urban social movements, in the “rebel cities” (Harvey, 2012), in the last decade. The conflicts selected for the two compared city contexts took place over contested “indeterminate territories” and “urban voids. ” As yet “indeterminate,” these places allow unveiling the generative conflict on different meanings of the city. In these processes the “urban void” plays a key role because, according to Borret (2009), the “empty” {{can be seen as a}} productive element in the urban public space, as it is not tied to a single interpretation or intention. The bottom-up and grassroots practices proposed, experimented, developed over these spaces are intended as strategy of resistance/opposition to not-negotiated politics in a framework of economic crisis and urban austerity increasingly producing side effects including gentrification and social exclusion and the welfare state crisis. In response to this the movements of insurgent citizenship are organized in many forms: from tenants’ organizations activists, who oppose gentrification and evictions in former working class neighbourhoods of Berlin (Holm, 2010) and calling for more public policies capable to combat speculation and address disinvestment in the subsidized housing sector; to movements of housing struggle in Rome claiming the access to more affordable places in the context of the strong housing crisis; to autonomous movements subtracting spaces from the capitalist logic of the market competitiveness and the speculation (in the case of Berlin and Rome) for living and for social, political, artistic and recreational activities (Membretti, 2003; Holm, Kuhn, 2011; Pruijt, 2012); to urban social movements trying to oppose the privatization of parts of the city considered a “common good”, using various state-driven mechanisms to advance their causes against civic policies, projects, and regulatory measures, that are considered detrimental to the city's public space, such as the groups of citizens reclaiming co-/self-managed public spaces and services (e. g. Gualini, Majoor, 2007, for Amsterdam; Gualini, 2008, for Berlin; Pask, 2010 in the case of Vancouver; Teatro Valle, 2012, in the case of Rome; Vitale, 2007 and Gualini 2014 several cases). In summary, the limits of urbanism based on competitive growth and profit have been emphasized by numerous critical and theoretical practices that have developed theories capable of analysing the issue to a higher level of argumentations, including systemic and ideological aspects, from the point of view of all the actors involved. These intellectual resources, can be useful «for those institutions, movements and actors aiming [ [...] . ] to promote alternative forms of urbanism, radically democratic, socially just and sustainable» (Brenner, Marcuse, Mayer, 2009). The interesting element is the capacity of these communities to propose, experiment and develop, through forms of social struggles and collective/cooperative action, alternatives to what are considered as unsustainable strategies of urban transformations (mostly based on the substitution/reduction of public resources), analysing power relationships, negotiation of conflicts and participation in institutional planning practice. Doing so, some of these forms of spatial contestation, such as the “transitional reappropriated spaces” (Growth and Corijn, 2005) –on which the research focus- have shown in recent years a programmatic capacity and a proactive potential in suggesting and implementing “Public Policies from the Bottom” (Paba, 2010) : e. g. “banking and financial policies” through the activation of forms of microcredit; “training and educational policies” offering a wide range of free or very affordable courses; “policies of management and recycling of waste, housing policies, policies to support youth and women entrepreneurship, policies addressing the problems of immigration, cultural and sports policies”; “architectural heritage renewal policies”, and others. These two European cities have faced so a renewed interest in the phenomenon of “reclaiming” of urban physical spaces that was carried on by social movements and wilfully appropriated by citizens using “appropriation” as a legitimate tactic of protest. Moreover, these radical participated practices have been a tool that enables experimentation and implementation of grassroots alternatives embodying a series of dynamics of “insurgent (re) appropriation” of urban space and self-production and provision of collective resources. Doing so, these informal actors and grassroots groups, organized in new forms of urban social movements, experimenting more progressive understanding of the mechanisms of space and social reproduction, started reclaiming the idea of “commons” and together with it the role that a third subject, a collective subject (different from a single private investor or the State and public institutions), could play in a direct management of what are intended to be collective properties/resources. In the two cities contexts analysed citizens have implemented a set of new strategies. Among them: new forms of <b>self-help</b> collective <b>housing,</b> self-/co-managed public spaces and the definition of urban commons. The research analyse some relevant cases of insurgent reappropriation/reclaiming of urban public spaces making a comparison between two cities historically characterized by organized forms of social struggle and grassroots transitional space reappropriations. Which is the value of such alternative experiences? Can these grass-root experiments of self-management and DIY renovation contribute to the production of new operative strategies for: public housing stock; heritage management; alternative forms of welfare; the development of more sustainable urban transformation practices and public space management? Analysing the evolution of the same pattern in forms of contestation, it permits to investigate how/if these practices have stand the chance to be facilitated, hampered, or co-opted, during the time and how each of these have had/can have an impact upon contemporary policymaking in political economy and if they have been/can be able to influence a change in the welfare policies and urban agenda. Diese Dissertation versucht, eine kritische Analyse von Konflikten unstrittener Erscheinungsformen städtischer Transformation und Politik im metropolitanem Raum von Rom und Berlin zu präsentieren (vergleichende Analyse entwickelt im gemeinsamen Tutoring der Forschungsthese). Der Fokus dieser Dissertation liegt insbesondere auf dem Zurückerobern (Reclaiming) der "Recht auf Stadt"-Debatte, die ein erneuertes Interesse unter städtischen sozialen Bewegungen und Akademiker*innen erweckt und beobachtet, basierend auf Protesten in den Strassen und der Entwicklung der sozialen Bewegungen der letzten Dekade in den "rebellischen Städten" (Harvey, 2012). Die analysierten Konflikten in den zwei vergleichenden Städten finden auf umstrittenen "ungeklärten/unbestimmten Territorien" und verlassenen, leer stehenden Räumen und Grundstücken statt. "Unbestimmte Territorien" offenbaren den generativen Konflikt unterschiedlicher Bedeutung und Interessen der Stadt. In diesen spielen die leer stehenden Gebäude und Orte eine besondere Rolle, weil, laut Borret (2009), das Leere als ein produktives Element im städtischen öffentlichen Raum gedeutet und gesehen werden kann, nicht gebunden und vordefiniert an eine einzige Interpretation oder Absicht. Die in diesen Räumen vorgeschlagenen, entwickelten, ausprobierten Praktiken der Basisbewegungen können als Strategie von Widerstand und Opposition gegen eine (nicht ausgehandelte) Politik im Rahmen der ökonomischen Krise und städtischen Austerität mit zunehmenden Auswirkungen wie Gentrifizierung, sozialer Exklusion und Krise des Sozialstaates, gesehen werden. Als Antwort darauf haben sich die rebellischen Bürger*innen Bewegungen (insurgent citizenship) auf vielfältige Weise organisiert: von Mieter*innen/Aktivist*innen Organisationen, die der Gentrifizierung und den (Zwangs) -Räumungen in den ehemaligen Arbeiter*innenvierteln Berlins widerstehen (Holm, 2010) und zu mehr öffentlicher Politik auffordern, die fähig sei, der Spekulation sowie der Desinvestition im subventionierten Wohnungsbausektor entgegen zutreten; bis hin zu Bewegungen der Wohnungskämpfe (housing struggle) in Rom, die Zugang zu mehr bezahlbarem Wohnraum im Kontext der Wohnungsmarktkrise fordern; autonomen Bewegungen, die Orte und Räume aus der kapitalistischen Logik der Marktwettbewerbfähigkeit und der Spekulation für Wohnraum (an den Beispielen von Berlin und Rom), soziale, politische, künstlerische und Erholungsaktivitäten herausbrechen (Membretti, 2003; Holm, Kuhn, 2011; Pruijt, 2012); und städtischen sozialen Bewegungen, die versuchen, der Privatisierung von Teilen der Stadt, was als Allgemeingut verstanden wird, zu widerstehen - in Form unterschiedlicher staatlich bedingter Mechanismen, um deren Anliegen, was als schädlich gegenüber dem öffentlichen städtischen Raum betrachtet wird, gegen staatliche Politik, Projekte und Regulatorien zu untermauern, wie die Gruppen von Bürger*innen, die co-/selbst-organisierte öffentliche Räume und Service zurückerobern (z. B. Gualini, Majoor, 2007, für Amsterdam; Gualini, 2008, für Berlin; Pask, 2010 für Vancouver; Teatro Valle, 2012, für Rom; Vitale, 2007 und Gualini 2014 in einigen Fällen). Zusammenfassend sind die Grenzen des Urbanismus, basierend auf konkurrierendem Wachstum und Profit, erkennbar und hervorgehoben von zahlreichen kritischen und theoretischen Praktiken, die Theorien entwickelten, fähig das Thema auf einem höheren Level der Argumentation, inklusive systemischer und ideologischer Aspekte, zu analysieren - und zwar aus den Persektiven aller Involvierten Akteur*innen. Diese intellektuellen Mittel können nützlich für "diese Institutionen, Bewegungen und Akteur*innen sein, welche alternative Formen des Urbanismus, radikaler Demokratie, sozial und nachhältig vorantreiben möchten" (Brenner, Marcuse, Mayer, 2009). Das interesante Element ist die Fähigkeit dieser Communities und Gemeinschaften, durch Formen sozialer Kämpfe, und kollektiven/kooperativen Aktivitäten, Alternativen zu nicht nachhaltiger städtischer Transformation vorzuschlagen, zu entwickeln und auszuprobieren sowie Machtstrukturen, die Aushandlung von Konflikten und die Partizipation in institutionalisierter Städteplanung und Praxis zu analysieren. Diese zwei europäischen Städte haben das Interesse des Phänomens Reclaiming, des Zurückeroberns städtischer physischer Räume erweckt, ausgeführt von sozialen Bewegungen und bewußt übernommen von der Bürger*innenschaft als Aneignung und legitime Form und Taktik von Protest. Zudem sind diese radikale partizipativen Praktiken ein Werkzeug, dass Experimentation und Umsetzung basisorganisierter Alternativen ermöglicht und demzufolge eine Serie von rebellischen aneignenden Dynamiken des städtischen Raumes sowie Eigenproduktion und Bereitstellung kollektiver Resourcen verkörpert. Diese informellen Akteur*innen und Basisgruppen, organisiert in neuen Formen städtischer sozialer Bewegungen, experimentierend in progressivem Verstehen der Mechanismen von Raum und sozialer Reproduktion, begannen die Idee von Commons zusammen mit der Rolle eines dritten Subjekts, eines kollektiven Subjekts, zurück zuerobern. Sie können eine direkte Verwaltung und Organisierung als kollektive Resource und kollektives Eigentum ausfüllen. In den Kontexten der beiden analysierten Städten haben die Bürger*innen eine Reihe neuer Strategien realisiert. Dazu zählen: Neue Formen der kollektiven Häuser und Wohnraum-Selbsthilfe, Selbstorganisierte öffentliche Räume und die Definition von städtischen Commons. Die Forschungsanalyse analysiert einige relevante Fälle rebellischer Wiederaneignung/Zurückeroberungen öffentlicher städtischer Räume und vergleicht zwei Städte, die historisch betrachtet von organisierten Formen sozialer Kämpfe und Basis-transitionaler Raumaneignung gekennzeichnet sind. Was ist der Wert, der Nutzen solcher alternativer Erfahrungen? Können diese grass-root-Experimente der Selbst-Organisierung und DIY Renovation zu der Produktion neuer operativer Strategien für den öffentlichen Wohnraum- und Häuser Bestand; des Bauerbe-Managements; der alternativen Formen von Wohlstand; der Entwicklung mehr nachhaltiger städtischer Transformations Praktiken und öffentlicher Raum Managements beitragen...|$|R
