5|$|The Bengal slow loris {{has a small}} {{swelling}} on the {{ventral side}} of its elbow called the brachial gland, which secretes a pungent, clear oily toxin that the animal uses defensively by wiping it on its toothcomb. The oil has been analyzed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, {{and it has been}} shown that almost half of the several dozen volatile or semi-volatile chemicals present do not occur in the closely related pygmy slow loris. The most predominant component was the phenolic compound m-cresol. The authors of the <b>study</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the chemically complex oils may help the lorises communicate with each other, allowing them to transmit by scent information about sex, age, health and nutritional status, and dominance.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to immediate health effects, some injuries sustained during a player's career can have effects that extend to their post-career life. A cohort mortality study {{by researchers at}} the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) examined 3,349 NFL players who played at least five full seasons from 1959 to 1988. The findings from this <b>study</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that,</b> in comparison to the typical American male, NFL players live longer on average but have around three times the risk of death associated with neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, the risk of death from Alzheimer's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was roughly four times higher among former players than the average American male. The study also compared mortality risks from speed players (quarterbacks, running backs, fullbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, linebackers, cornerbacks, and safeties) and nonspeed players (offensive and defensive linemen), with findings indicating that a greater number of deaths were attributable to neurodegenerative disorders in speed players than nonspeed players. This {{may be due to the}} increased momentum of collisions from speed players.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the techniques proposed may fall short of predictions. In ocean iron fertilization, for example, {{the amount of carbon}} dioxide removed from the atmosphere may be much lower than predicted, as carbon taken up by plankton may be released back into the atmosphere from dead plankton, rather than being carried {{to the bottom of the}} sea and sequestered. Model results from a 2016 <b>study,</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> blooming algae could even accelerate Arctic warming.|$|E

25|$|A {{study by}} Sernyak and colleagues {{found that the}} {{prevalence}} of diabetes in atypical antipsychotic treatments was statistically significantly {{higher than that of}} conventional treatment. The authors of this <b>study</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> it is a causal relationship the Kabinoff et al. suggest the findings only suggest a temporal association. Kabinoff et al. suggest that there is insufficient data from large studies to demonstrate a consistent or significant difference in the risk of insulin resistance during treatment with various atypical antipsychotics.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{study found}} that 20% of wolves and 37% of dogs shared the same {{mitochondrial}} haplotypes in Georgia. More than 13% of the studied wolves had detectable dog ancestry and more than 10% of the dogs had detectable wolf ancestry. The results of the <b>study</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> wolf-dog hybridization is a common event in the areas where large livestock guardian dogs are held in a traditional way, and that gene flow between dogs and gray wolves was an important force influencing gene pool of dogs for millennia since early domestication events.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, {{researchers}} from the School of Human Communication Sciences at La Trobe University in Bundoora, Victoria (Australia) noted that, after undergoing five voice therapy sessions targeted at lip spreading and forward tongue carriage, ten transfeminine individuals demonstrated a general increase in the formant frequency values F1, F2, and F3 {{as well as the}} fundamental frequency value F0. In increasing these frequency values, it was possible for these transfeminine individuals to more closely approximate the vocal frequency of cisgender women. The particular type of therapy used was oral resonance therapy, and the generally positive results of this <b>study</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> it could be used for this purpose on a regular basis for those with the means and desire to increase the frequency of their voice.|$|E
25|$|In chronic opioid users, such {{as those}} on Chronic Opioid Analgesic Therapy (COAT) for {{managing}} severe, chronic pain, behavioural testing has shown normal functioning on perception, cognition, coordination and behaviour in most cases. One 2000 study analysed COAT patients {{to determine whether they}} were able to safely operate a motor vehicle. The findings from this <b>study</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> stable opioid use does not significantly impair abilities inherent in driving (this includes physical, cognitive and perceptual skills). COAT patients showed rapid completion of tasks that require speed of responding for successful performance (e.g., Rey Complex Figure Test) but made more errors than controls. COAT patients showed no deficits in visual-spatial perception and organization (as shown in the WAIS-R Block Design Test) but did show impaired immediate and short-term visual memory (as shown on the Rey Complex Figure Test– Recall). These patients showed no impairments in higher order cognitive abilities (i.e., planning). COAT patients appeared to have difficulty following instructions and showed a propensity toward impulsive behaviour, yet this did not reach statistical significance. It {{is important to note that}} this study reveals that COAT patients have no domain-specific deficits, which supports the notion that chronic opioid use has minor effects on psychomotor, cognitive, or neuropsychological functioning.|$|E
25|$|More recent {{research}} has extended established findings of age related decline in executive functioning, by examining related cognitive processes that underlie healthy older adults’ sequential performance. Sequential performance refers to the execution of a series steps needed to complete a routine, such as the steps required to make {{a cup of coffee}} or drive a car. An important part of healthy aging involves older adults’ use of memory and inhibitory processes to carry out daily activities in a fixed order without forgetting the sequence of steps that were just completed while remembering {{the next step in the}} sequence. A recent study examined how young and older adults differ in the underlying representation of a sequence of tasks and their efficiency at retrieving the information needed to complete their routine. Findings from this study revealed that when older and young adults had to remember a sequence of 8 animal images arranged in a fixed order, both age groups spontaneously used the organizational strategy of chunking to facilitate retrieval of information. However, older adults were slower at accessing each chunk compared to younger adults, and were better able to benefit from the use of memory aids, such as verbal rehearsal to remember the order of the fixed sequence. Results from this <b>study</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> there are age differences in memory and inhibitory processes that affect people’s sequence of actions and the use of memory aids could facilitate the retrieval of information in older age.|$|E

500|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} within the genus Nycticebus {{have been studied}} with modern molecular techniques, using DNA sequences derived from the mitochondrial DNA markers D-loop and cytochromeb from 22 slow loris individuals. In this analysis, most of the recognized lineages of Nycticebus, including the pygmy slow loris, [...] were shown to be genetically distinct, and the species was shown to have diverged earlier than the other slow loris species, beginning perhaps 2.7 million years ago. [...] Analysis of nucleotide sequence diversity from individuals taken from the boundary areas between southern China and Vietnam (a region of sympatry between the pygmy slow loris and the Bengal slow loris) show that the pygmy slow loris {{is not subject to}} the same introgressive hybridization as the Bengal slow loris (N.bengalensis). The authors of the <b>study</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the low polymorphism of pygmy slow lorises may be due to a founder effect, and that the individuals they used in the study originate from an ancestor that lived in middle or southern Vietnam between 1860 and 7350 years ago.|$|E
2500|$|A study concluded, [...] "Mild to {{moderate}} alcohol consumption {{is associated with}} a lower prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, with a favorable influence on lipids, waist circumference, and fasting insulin.

A J-curve association between alcohol intake and metabolic syndrome was found: [...] "The results of the present <b>study</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the metabolic syndrome is negatively associated with light alcohol consumption (1–15 g alcohol/d) in Korean adults".

2500|$|The Lake Wobegon effect, {{a natural}} human {{tendency}} to overestimate one's capabilities, was coined by Professor David G Myers {{in honour of}} the fictional town. The characterization of the fictional location, where [...] "all the women are strong, all the men are good looking, and all the children are above average," [...] {{has been used to}} describe a real and pervasive human tendency to overestimate one's achievements and capabilities in relation to others. To support the view that people in general need to believe that they are above average (the Lake Wobegon effect) one author points out that in a survey of high school students, only 2 percent of the students reported that they were below average in leadership ability. The authors of a <b>study</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> what they consider the “Lake Wobegon effect” can in some cases negatively affect the doctor’s treatment advice when, in planning treatment, doctors portray the patients as “above average”.|$|E
