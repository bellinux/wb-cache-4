5000|$|Recognition that wooden-winged gliders were {{becoming}} outdated {{resulted in a}} redesigned wing, aerodynamically {{the same as the}} WA 26 <b>Squale</b> but built of GRP and fitted with Schempp-Hirth rather than trailing edge airbrakes. This led to the WA 28 Espadon, the new wing mounted on a <b>Squale</b> fuselage with a GRP all moving tail in place of the Squale's wooden one. The Espadon is 20-25 kg (44-55 lb) heavier than the Squale; its best glide ratio is 1:36 at 88 km/h (55 mph). [...] It first flew in May 1974 and went into production that November; by the Spring of 1975, 20 were on order. It soon became apparent that competitors like the Schleicher ASW 15 had significantly better performance and production did not continue for long.|$|E

50|$|From 1956 {{until at}} least 1964 Wassmer built and {{developed}} the successful Javelot series of single seat gliders.

The <b>Squale</b> was attempt to break into the high performance market. Like the Javelots, it had a wooden wing but one with a Wortmann profile; its fuselage was a more aerodynamically refined and wholly GRP structure.|$|E

50|$|The {{straight}} tapered, {{all moving tail}} of the <b>Squale</b> is also wooden, with a ply covered {{leading edge}} and fabric covering aft. It is shoulder mounted on the fuselage. The early Squales lacked elevator feel, so anti-balance tabs were added on the WA 26M version. The straight edged, swept fin and rudder, the latter horn balanced, are GRP structures, integral with the fuselage. This has an oval section which gradually increases in diameter forwards to the wings. There is a retractable monowheel undercarriage, fitted with an hydraulic brake and assisted by a small, fixed tailskid. The pilot's semi-reclining position is under a long, single piece canopy which hinges to port.|$|E

40|$|With {{the growing}} need for quality {{assessment}} of entire software systems in industry, new issues are emerging. First, since most software quality metrics are defined {{at the level}} of individual software components, {{there is a need for}} aggregation methods to summarize the results at the system level. Second, since a software evaluation requires the use of different metrics, with possibly widely varying output ranges, there is a need to combine these results into a unified quality assessment. In this paper we derive, from our experience on real industrial cases as well as from the scientific litterature, requirements for an aggregation method. We then present a solution through the <b>Squale</b> model for metric aggregation, a model specifically designed to address the needs of practitioners. We empirically validate the adequacy of <b>Squale</b> through experiments on Eclipse. Additionally, we compare the <b>Squale</b> model to both traditional aggregation techniques (e. g., the arithmetic mean), as well as to econometric inequality indices (e. g., the Gini or the Theil indices), recently applied to aggregation of software metrics.

40|$|ISO 9126 {{promotes}} a three-level model of quality (fac- tors, criteria, and metrics) which {{allows one to}} assess qual- ity at the top level of factors and criteria. However, it is dif- ficult to use this model {{as a tool to}} increase software quality. In the <b>Squale</b> model, we propose the adjunction of prac- tices as an intermediate level between metrics and crite- ria. Practices abstract from raw information at the source (metrics, tool reports, audits) to provide the developer with technical guidelines to respect. Moreover, practice marks can be adjusted using formulae to suit company develop- ment habits or exigences: for example bad marks can be stressed to point to places which need the most attention. Dashboards allow one to spot faulty practices and find the source elements responsible for the bad marks. The <b>Squale</b> model has been developed and validated over the last cou- ple of years in an industrial setting with Air France-KML and PSA Peugeot-Citroën.
