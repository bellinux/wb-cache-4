5000|$|The {{earliest}} known reverse contrast types date {{to about}} 1821. They were created H.W. Caslon company in London, presumably as {{a parody of}} Didone typefaces and lettering of the period. Nicolete Gray, quoting Francis Thibaudeau, wrote in Nineteenth Century Ornamented Typefaces that the style appeared (presumably as lettering) in France slightly earlier during the First French Empire (1804-1815) without giving a specific example. The typeface had very thick serifs, so {{the gap between the}} serifs and the main strokes making up the letters was very small, as can be seen on letters such as 'E' and 'S'. To make the effect even more shocking, the thicker line on the 'A' was moved from its normal position on the right to the left, making a letter {{that seems to be the}} wrong way round. A caps-only design, <b>steel</b> <b>master</b> punches for the typeface (perhaps not the very first) survive in the collection of the St Bride Library, London. Writing for Print magazine, Paul Shaw described it as [...] "one of the most bizarre slab serif types of the 19th century."

5000|$|First, {{an artist}} creates a large plaster {{model of the}} coin. The plaster model is then coated with rubber. The rubber mold is then used to make an epoxy galvano. All of this takes place {{on a scale of}} around eight inches. Next, a Janvier {{reducing}} lathe takes several days to reduce the image onto a <b>steel</b> <b>master</b> hub. The master hub is then heat treated to make it hard. The master hub is then to make only a few master dies via hubbing, which involves pressing the master hub into a steel blank to impress the image into the die. The master die is then used to form as many working hubs as needed through the same process, and then the working hubs are put through the same process to form the working dies. These working dies are the actual dies which will strike coins. The process of transferring the hub to the die can be repeated as many times as necessary in order to form the number of dies needed to make the number of coins required. The difference between a hub and a die is that the hub has a raised image and a die has an [...] image, so one forms the other.|$|E

50|$|The {{broadcast}} originates {{from the}} ninth {{floor of the}} main control tower at the Speedway, known as the Pagoda. From 1957 to 1998, the broadcast originated from the glass and <b>steel</b> <b>Master</b> Control Tower, which formerly sat in that location. Prior to that, a radio booth was situated inside or {{in front of the}} wooden pagoda that pre-dated the Master Control Tower. For the 1999 race, a temporary makeshift booth was utilized during construction of the new Pagoda.Since its inception, additional reporters {{have been part of the}} broadcasting crew, covering the vast circuit in the turns and in the pit area. In the 1940s and early 1950s, a roving reporter was assigned to the south turns (turns 1 and 2), and another was assigned to the north turns (turns 3 and 4). A vantage point on the backstretch was also manned. By 1957, the crew was expanded with a reporter assigned to each of the four turns, as well as the backstretch, for a total of five remote locations. In the pit area, the crew expanded to three men, one each covering the north pits, center pits, and south pits. With the starting field traditionally comprising 33 cars, each pit reporter was assigned roughly eleven pit stalls to observe and report from. The three-man pit reporting crew of Chuck Marlowe, (north), Luke Walton (center), and Lou Palmer (south) became a fixture of the broadcast for over twenty years. Other key fixtures in the turns included Jim Shelton (turn 4), Howdy Bell (turn 2), Mike Ahern, and Ron Carrell. When the pit road was lengthened in 1974, a fourth pit reporter was added. Also in the 1970s, a roving reporter was added with his duties primarily to cover the garage area and track hospital.|$|E

Two identical stainless <b>steel</b> <b>master</b> casts were milled simulating the tooth reduction for metal ceramic crowns; one with long chanfer and another with round shoulder preparations. The impression material used was a polivinilsyloxane silicone with the double impression technique, thus obtaining ten specimens of each máster cast. To establish a pattern for impression a sheet of accetate with 1, 4 mm thick was used. A dental surveyor was prepared to maintain constant the insertion and the removal axis of the master casts during all the impressions. The dies were made with gypsum type IV and after the casts were dyed with spacer, these were duplicated with laboratory silicone to obtain a second master cast with special gypsum. The casts were prepare with copper wire and coated with silver to promove the galvanic current so that a gold eletroforming is achieved. Upon adjustment and cleansing, the copings were adjusted to the master casts, which were fixed in an octagonal stainless steel table, and observed at a measuring microscope Olympus equipped with digital desk. The data obtained was submitted to “t” test and Mann-Whitney statistical test with significance level of 5 %.

Materials and Methods: A customized stainless <b>steel</b> <b>master</b> model containing two interchangeable dies was used for fabrication of provisional crowns. Forty crowns (n = 10) were fabricated, and each crown was evaluated under a stereomicroscope. Vertical marginal discrepancies were noted and compared at 10 min {{since the start of}} mixing and then at 30 min. Observations and Results: Protemp 4 showed the least vertical marginal discrepancy (71. 59 μ), followed by Luxatemp Star (91. 93 μ) at 10 min. DPI showed a marginal discrepancy of 95. 94 μ while Visalys Temp crowns had vertical marginal discrepancy of 106. 81 μ. There was {{a significant difference in the}} marginal discrepancy values of Protemp 4 and Visalys Temp. At 30 min, there was a significant difference between the marginal discrepancy of Protemp 4 crowns (83. 11 μ) and Visalys Temp crowns (128. 97 μ) and between Protemp 4 and DPI (118. 88 μ). No significant differences were observed between Protemp 4 and Luxatemp Star. Conclusion: The vertical marginal discrepancy of temporary crowns fabricated from the four commercially available provisional materials ranged from 71 to 106 μ immediately after fabrication (at 10 min from the start of mix) to 83 - 128 μ (30 min from the start of mix).

Stainless <b>steel</b> <b>master</b> models were fabricated to simulate tooth preparation for metal-ceramic crowns with different finish lines (BRS and BLC). Ten dies were obtained from each model. Preparations were coated with 2 layers of spacer to 1 mm from the margin. Sintercast gold copings were prepared, sintered and adjusted to the dies. The copings (n= 10) were placed onto the master model and the marginal gap was measured in 24 equidistant points using optical microscopy (X 230). An opaque and two body ceramic layers were subsequently applied to the copings and the same measuring procedure was performed for the crowns. The data were analyzed statistically using paired and unpaired Student’s t-test (α= 0. 05). Mean marginal gap values (μm) for the copings and crowns were, respectively: 113. 6 and 117. 1 for the BRS; and 58. 2 and 74. 3 for the BLC preparation. Significantly greater marginal gaps (p= 0. 0307) were found for restorations with BRS than with BLC finish line, which also showed statistically significant differences in the gap size between coping and crown (p= 0. 001). In conclusion, marginal gap is influenced by ceramic application on copings fabricated on BLC preparation, and greater marginal gaps were found for restorations with BRS finish line, rejecting the experimental null hypotheses...|$|E
40|$|In {{cantilevered}} implant-supported complete prosthesis, the abutments` different heights represent different lever arms {{to which}} the abutments are subjected resulting in deformation of the components, which in turn transmit the load to the adjacent bone. The purpose of this in vitro study was to quantitatively assess the deformation of abutments of different heights in mandibular cantilevered implant-supported complete prosthesis. A circular <b>steel</b> <b>master</b> cast with five perforations containing implant replicas (O 3. 75 mm) was used. Two groups were formed according to the types of alloy of the framework (CoCr or PdAg). Three frameworks were made for each group to be tested with 4, 5. 5 and 7 mm abutments. A 100 N load was applied at a point 15 mm distal {{to the center of}} the terminal implant. Readings of the deformations generated on the mesial and distal aspects of the abutments were obtained with the use of strain gauges. Deformation caused by tension and compression was observed in all specimens with the terminal abutment taking most of the load. An increase in deformation was observed in the terminal abutment as the height was increased. The use of an alloy of higher elastic modulus (CoCr) also caused the abutment deformation to increase.

40|$|MastersThe {{review of}} the {{literature}} reflects variable results regarding the effect of veneering porcelain on the marginal fit of the crown coping in metal ceramic and all-ceramic restorations in relation to different finish lines, materials and systems. As the zirconia material is gaining popularity these days due to its exceptional strength and fracture toughness combined with promising esthetic results achieved by the application of its recommended veneering porcelain, {{the purpose of the study}} was to reveal the effect of Cercon® Ceram Kiss veneering porcelain (DeguDent/ Germany) on the marginal fit of Cercon® zirconia coping (Cercon® Smart Ceramic System/ DeguDent/ Hanau/ Germany) in relation to 1 mm shoulder and chamfer finish lines. Two master stainless steel models of a single posterior full-crown preparation were machined for the shoulder and chamfer finish line preparations. Then duplicated into stone models that were scanned by Cercon® Smart Ceramic System to produce thirty Cercon zirconia copings for each finish line preparation which were veneered later with Cercon® Ceram kiss veneering porcelain. The assessment of the marginal fit of the specimens was performed on the stainless <b>steel</b> <b>master</b> models in relation to 31 defined points secured with the specimen positioning device (SPD) using the direct view technique with the aid of the Traveling Measuring Microscope in relation to 1 mm shoulder and chamfer finish lines before and after the addition of the veneering porcelain. The data were statistically analyzed using Student paired and independent ttests to compare the marginal fit of Cercon® zirconia coping before and after adding the veneering porcelain for the shoulder and chamfer finish lines separately and the marginal fit of the final crowns of both the shoulder and chamfer finish lines respectively. The results indicated that the addition of veneering porcelain significantly affected the marginal fit of both finish lines preparations (P< 0. 05). The mean marginal fit of cercon® zirconia coping was (32. 23 =m ± 6. 14) for shoulder finish line and (97. 68 =m ± 9. 20) for chamfer finish line.

In addition, to compare the effect of a protocol of gradual tightening force of prosthetic screws to an instantaneous one, on the values of screw preload. Material and Methods: A stainless <b>steel</b> <b>master</b> metal model was machined to represent mandibular arch form with four implant fixtures 4. 1 × 14 mm (ITI system, Straumann) distributed quadrilaterally two on each side in posterior and anterior segments. A single metal superstructure was constructed in semiprecous gold alloy. One linear strain gauge was attached on the smooth neck surface of each ITI implant and wired into a quarter-bridge configuration. The signals from the bridges were fed into a 10 -channel strain gauge monitoring system and calibrated in Newton. The prosthetic screws of the superstructure were tightened according to six different tightening sequences using a digital torque gauge. Each tightening sequence included two different tightening protocols: gradual tightening (0 - 5 - 10 - 15 Ncm), and Instantaneous tightening (0 - 15 Ncm), with a total of 60 experiments (6 sequences × 2 protocols × 5 replications). A new prosthetic screw was used for each sequence and protocol while the same screw was used in the replication experiments. A total of 48 new screws were utilized. The experiment runs were randomized between sequences and protocols. The preload values for the four implants was recorded simultaneously in each experiment. Results: results indicated a statistically significant difference between tightening sequences at each implant (P< 0. 05). The protocol effect was significant only at implant 2 and 3. A significant interaction between sequence and protocol effects was found at all implants (P< 0. 05). In the gradual tightening protocol, higher sum preload was found in tightening sequences B (311. 5 N± 84. 6), C (245. 9 N± 54. 1), and D (309. 8 N± 95. 5). In the instantaneous tightening protocol, higher sum preload was found in tightening sequences A (285. 5 N± 94), E (763. 4 N± 141. 4), and F (349. 7 N± 68. 7). Tightening sequence E resulted in a statistically significantly higher sum preload than all other sequences only in the instantaneous protocol (763. 4 N± 141. 4) but not in the gradual protocol which showed lower sum preload values compared to other sequences (P< 0. 05). Results showed on average the sum preload increased upon repeated use of the same prosthetic screw. Conclusion: From the results of the study, it is concluded that: 1. There were significant differences in the screw preload between different tightening sequences, and protocols. 2. Gradual tightening resulted in higher preload in sequences B, C, and D. 3. Instantaneous tightening resulted in higher preload in sequences A, E, and F. 4. Minor fit inaccuracy of superstructure resulted in large variations in the registered preload between implants as the superstructure was tightened which was more distinct in the instantaneous protocol. 5. The highest sum screw preload was achieved when anterior implants of the superstructure were first tightened instantaneously followed by posterior implants. 6. A trend of increased preload with repeated screw use was observed...|$|E
