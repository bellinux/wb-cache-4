As he advanced to greet her, it was evident that his military title was not one of the mere fanciful sobriquets of the locality. In his erect figure and the disciplined composure of limb and attitude there were still traces of the refined academic rigors of West Point. The pliant adaptability of Western civilization which enabled him, three years before, to leave the army and transfer his executive ability to the more profitable profession of the law, had loosed sash and <b>shoulder-strap,</b> but had not entirely removed the restraint of the one, or the bearing of the other.|$|E

60|$|Small-pox is dreaded, and {{infected}} persons often cruelly shunned: {{a suspicion}} {{of this or}} of cholera frequently emptying a village or town in a night. Vaccination has been introduced by Dr. Pearson, and it is much practised by Dr. Campbell; it being eagerly sought. Cholera is scarcely known at Dorjiling, and when it has been imported thither has never spread. Disease is very rare amongst the Lepchas; and ophthalmic, elephantiasis, and leprosy, the scourges of hot climates, are rarely known. Goitre prevails,* [May not {{the use of the}} head instead of the <b>shoulder-strap</b> in carrying loads be a predisposing cause of goitre, by inducing congestion of the laryngeal vessels? The Lepcha is certainly far more free from this disease than any of the tribes of E. Nepal I have mixed with, and he is both more idle and less addicted to the head-strap as a porter. I have seen it to be almost universal in some villages of Bhoteeas, where the head-strap alone is used in carrying in both summer and winter crops; as also amongst the salt-traders, or rather those families who carry the salt from the passes to the Nepalese villages, and who very frequently have no shoulder-straps, but invariably head-bands. I am far from attributing all goitre, even in the mountains, to this practice, but I think it is proved, that the disease is most prevalent in the mountainous regions of both the old and new world, and that in these the practice of supporting enormous loads by the cervical muscles is frequent. It is also found in the Himalayan sheep and goats which accompany the salt-traders, and whose loads are supported in ascending, by a band passing under the throat.] though not so conspicuously as amongst. Bhoteeas, Bhotanese, and others. Rheumatism is frequent, and intermittent fevers, with ague; also violent and often fatal remittents, almost invariably induced by sleeping in the hot valleys, especially {{at the beginning and end}} of the rains. The European complaints of liver and bowel disease are all but unknown. Death is regarded with horror. The dead are burnt or buried, sometimes both; much depending on custom and position. Omens are sought in the entrails of fowls, etc., and other vestiges of their savage origin are still preserved, though now gradually disappearing.|$|E
6000|$|Ineffable, unsurpassable {{those hours}} of {{initiation}} which the Broadway of the 'fifties had been, when all was said, so adequate to supply. If one wanted pictures there were pictures, as large, I seem to remember, as {{the side of}} a house, and of a bravery of colour and lustre of surface that I was never afterwards to see surpassed. We were shown without doubt, under our genial law here too, everything there was, and as I cast up the items I wonder, I confess, what ampler fare we could have dealt with. The Düsseldorf school commanded the market, and I think of its exhibition as firmly seated, going on from year to year--New York, judging now to such another tune, must have been a brave patron of that manufacture; I believe that scandal even was on occasion not evaded, rather was boldly invoked, though of what particular sacrifices to the pure plastic or undraped shocks to bourgeois prejudice the comfortable German genius of that period may have been capable history has kept no record. New accessions, at any rate, vividly new ones, in which the freshness and brightness of the paint, particularly lustrous in our copious light, enhanced from time to time the show, which I have the sense of our thus repeatedly and earnestly visiting and which comes back to me with some vagueness as installed in a disaffected church, where gothic excrescences and an ecclesiastical roof of a mild order helped the importance. No impression here, however, was half so momentous as that of the epoch-making masterpiece of Mr. Leutze, which showed us Washington crossing the Delaware in a wondrous flare of projected gaslight and with the effect of a revelation to my young sight of the capacity of accessories to [...] "stand out." [...] I live again in the thrill of that evening--which was the greater of course for my feeling it, in my parents' company, when I should otherwise have been in bed. We went down, after dinner, in the Fourteenth Street stage, quite as if going to the theatre; the scene of exhibition was near the Stuyvesant Institute (a circumstance stirring up somehow a swarm of associations, echoes probably of lectures discussed at home, yet at which my attendance had doubtless conveniently lapsed,) but Mr. Leutze's drama left behind any paler proscenium. We gaped responsive to every item, lost in the marvel of the wintry light, of the sharpness of the ice-blocks, of the sickness of the sick soldier, of the protrusion of the minor objects, that of the strands of the rope and the nails of the boots, that, I say, on the part of everything, of its determined purpose of standing out; but that, above all, of the profiled national hero's purpose, as might be said, of standing up, as much as possible, even indeed of doing it almost on one leg, in such difficulties, and successfully balancing. So memorable was that evening to remain for me that nothing could be more strange, in connection with it, than the illustration by the admired work, on its in after years again coming before me, of the cold cruelty with which time may turn and devour its children. The picture, more or less entombed in its relegation, was lividly dead--and that was bad enough. But half the substance of one's youth seemed buried with it. There were other pictorial evenings, I may add, not all of which had the thrill. Deep the disappointment, on my own part, I remember, at Bryan's Gallery of Christian Art, to which also, as for great emotions, we had taken the omnibus after dinner. It cast a chill, this collection of worm-eaten diptychs and triptychs, of angular saints and seraphs, of black Madonnas and obscure Bambinos, of such marked and approved [...] "primitives" [...] as had never yet been shipped to our shores. Mr. Bryan's shipment was presently to fall, I believe, under grave suspicion, was to undergo in fact fatal exposure; but it appealed at the moment in apparent good faith, and I have not forgotten how, conscious that it was fresh from Europe--"fresh" [...] was beautiful in the connection!--I felt that my yearning should all have gone out to it. With that inconsequence to handle I doubt whether I proclaimed that it bored me--any more than I have ever noted till now that it made me begin badly with Christian art. I like to think that the collection consisted without abatement of frauds and [...] "fakes" [...] and that if these had been honest things my perception wouldn't so have slumbered; yet the principle of interest had been somehow compromised, and I think I have never since stood before a real Primitive, a primitive of the primitives, without having first to shake off the grey mantle of that night. The main disconcertment had been its ugly twist to the name of Italy, already sweet to me for all its dimness--even could dimness have prevailed in my felt measure of the pictorial testimony of home, testimony that dropped for us from the ample canvas of Mr. Cole, [...] "the American Turner" [...] which covered half a side of our front parlour, and in which, though not an object represented in it began to stand out after the manner of Mr. Leutze, I could always lose myself as soon as look. It depicted Florence from one of the neighbouring hills--I have often since wondered which, the picture being long ago lost to our sight; Florence with her domes and towers and old walls, the old walls Mr. Cole had engaged for, but which I was ruefully to miss on coming to know and love the place in after years. Then it was I felt how long before my attachment had started on its course--that closer vision was no beginning, it only took up the tale; just as it comes to me again to-day, at the end of time, that the contemplative monk seated on a terrace in the foreground, a constant friend of my childhood, must have been of the convent of San Miniato, which gives me the site from which the painter wrought. We had Italy again in the corresponding room behind--a great abundance of Italy I was free to think while I revolved between another large landscape over the sofa and the classic marble bust on a pedestal between the two back windows, the figure, a part of the figure, of a lady with her head crowned with vine-leaves and her hair disposed with a laxity that was emulated by the front of her dress, as my next younger brother exposed himself to my derision by calling the bit of brocade (simulated by the chisel) that, depending from a single <b>shoulder-strap,</b> so imperfectly covered her. This image was known and admired among us as the Bacchante; she had come to us straight from an American studio in Rome, and I see my horizon flush again with the first faint dawn of conscious appreciation, or in other words of the critical spirit, while two or three of the more restrictive friends of the house find our marble lady very [...] "cold" [...] for a Bacchante. Cold indeed she must have been--quite as of the tombstone temperament; but that objection would drop if she might only be called a Nymph, since nymphs were mild and moderate, and since discussion of a work of art mainly hung in those days on that issue of the producible name. I fondly recall, by the same token, that playing on a certain occasion over the landscape above the sofa, restrictive criticism, uttered in my indulged hearing, introduced me to what had probably been my very first chance, on such ground, for active participation. The picture, from the hand of a French painter, M. Lefèvre, and of but slightly scanter extent than the work of Mr. Cole, represented in frank rich colours and as a so-called [...] "view in Tuscany" [...] a rural scene of some exuberance, a broken and precipitous place, amid mountains and forests, where two or three bare-legged peasants or woodmen were engaged, with much emphasis of posture, in felling a badly gashed but spreading oak by means of a tense rope attached to an upper limb and at which they pulled together. [...] "Tuscany?--are you sure it's Tuscany?" [...] said the voice of restrictive criticism, that of the friend of the house who in the golden age of the precursors, though we were still pretty much precursors, had lived longest in Italy. And then on my father's challenge of this demur: [...] "Oh in Tuscany, you know, the colours are much softer--there would be a certain haze in the atmosphere." [...] "Why, of course," [...] I can hear myself now blushingly but triumphantly intermingle--"the softness and the haze of our Florence there: isn't Florence in Tuscany?" [...] It had to be parentally admitted that Florence was--besides which our friend had been there and knew; so that thereafter, within our walls, a certain malaise reigned, for if the Florence was [...] "like it" [...] then the Lefèvre couldn't be, and if the Lefèvre was like it then the Florence couldn't: a lapse from old convenience--as from the moment we couldn't name the Lefèvre where were we? All of which it might have been open to me to feel I had uncannily promoted.|$|E

5000|$|Uniforms of the Heer as {{the ground}} forces of the Wehrmacht were {{distinguished}} from other branches by two devices: the army form of the Wehrmachtsadler or Hoheitszeichen (national emblem) worn above the right breast pocket, and - with certain exceptions - collar tabs bearing a pair of Litzen (Doppellitze [...] "double braid"), a device inherited from the old Prussian Guard which resembled a Roman numeral II on its side. Both eagle and Litzen were machine-embroidered or woven in white or grey (hand-embroidered in silk, silver or aluminium for officers). Rank was worn on <b>shoulder-straps</b> except for junior enlisted (Mannschaften), who wore plain <b>shoulder-straps</b> and their rank insignia, if any, on the left upper sleeve.

Until 1938 the underlay was of the same outer dimensions as the braid, and only visible edge-on; in that year the underlay was made wider, so as to create the impression of edge piping like the enlisted <b>shoulder-strap.</b> Rank was indicated by zero to two gilt-metal pips; unit designators were also of gilt metal.Field-grade officer (Stabsoffizier) shoulderboards were made by plaiting together double widths of Russia braid and looping them to form a buttonhole, sewn to a Waffenfarbe underlay; rank again was displayed by zero to two gilt pips.|$|E
50|$|In combat, each soldier carries one field {{dressing}} {{ready for}} immediate use. Standard doctrine {{is that a}} casualty's dressing should be used rather than the rescuer's - the rescuer may need to help another casualty, or be helped himself, whereas the original casualty {{is not going to}} make any other use of his own dressing. Because of this, it is important that soldiers know where to find their comrades' field dressings, and infantry units typically have their own SOP stating where they should be carried. British Army uniforms issued in the past included dedicated field dressing pockets. During the Great War, this pocket was in the front left skirt of the tunic, with the introduction of Battledress (1937), it was moved to the trousers, but the current clothing does not. Instead, a common location for field dressings is the left <b>shoulder-strap</b> of the webbing, either held in place with gaffer tape or contained in a small pouch that is not issued but can be purchased from several civilian suppliers.|$|E
30|$|Only one {{previous}} study has investigated {{the effect of}} altering bra strap orientation and design on both bra strap discomfort and pressure [5]. Vertical and cross-back bra strap orientations were compared with and without {{the addition of a}} small cushioned pad placed under the strap at the apex of the shoulder. Bra strap discomfort was not significantly different in any condition and bra strap pressure was only reduced with the addition of the cushioned pad in the cross-back orientation, which had higher pressures than in the vertical strap orientation, both with and without the cushioned pad. Although the results of this {{previous study}} suggest that bra strap discomfort and pressure cannot be reduced by altering bra strap orientation and design, the study had several limitations. For example, the authors reported that the cushioned pad was not effective in increasing strap width or, in turn, surface area of contact at the <b>shoulder-strap</b> interface as it was found to curl under the strap in the vertical condition [5]. The higher strap pressures in the cross-back orientation may also have been due to tighter straps in this orientation because the bra straps used in the study were commercially available convertible straps, which do not always allow for the greater distance required between the attachment sites of the bra in the cross-back orientation compared to the vertical orientation. It is also conflicting that the cross-back orientation was the most preferred by the 14 participants when it had the same level of discomfort as the vertical orientation and higher strap pressures. The participant number was also low, and the bra sizes, and in turn breast sizes, were at the small end of the spectrum for women with large breast [17 - 20]. It is also recognised that a range of reasons can affect bra strap preference, such as aesthetics and personal preference, which may have resulted in the cross-back orientation being the preferred orientation in the study cohort.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of a greater project run by No Picnic: the {{development}} of a brand new food store concept with a clear focus on healthy and ecological food and good service. It should be easy and pleasant to shop healthy food. The concept gives a global approach including skilled staff, interior decoration, advanced technology solutions and a good layout. The main focus of the thesis is to develop functional and intelligent interior for the store, and the project later focuses on developing a concept shopping cart, cart flow, a check-out station and the user interface for the information system. Literature studies, competitor analysis and a survey are carried through. They indicate that more focus on health is needed since people’s health is deteriorating. People need to find more pleasure in shopping and cooking, and make it with consideration for both their own health and the environment. There are some food stores similar to the concept internationally. However, they tend to focus on ecological food rather than healthy food, even if the first often implies the other. A problem definition is set to construct and design a smart, ergonomic and aesthetic concept for moving merchandise through the store that also helps finding nutrition values and other information about the products. The concept should also integrate an automatic check out function. A problem analysis is made which results in lists of requirements and wishes. One condition is given from the beginning, namely that the concept is to be optimized for use with an item-level RFID solution. This eliminates repacking of merchandise but requires an environment with no radio signal disturbance. Six concepts for moving items in-store are presented: one handheld, one carried on the arm, one <b>shoulder-strap</b> basket, two carts and one modular cart with bagholders. Evaluation shows that the concepts need to be improved to allow space-efficient storage and to minimize metal as construction material as it disturbs radio waves for the implemented RFID solutions. The concept development results in a small and convenient four-wheeled cart concept, CartER, almost solely made of plastic and with two foldable shelves. The back wheels are fixed while the front ones are flywheels, which makes the cart easy to manoeuvre. The sides of the cart are low to avoid heavy lifting and extra functions such as coat hanger, shopping list display and dampers, are integrated. The cart is supplemented with high quality, stable and strong paper bags, BagZ, with soft handles and slightly converging sides for optimal fitting in the cart. These bags can either be used like conventional baskets, or up to two can be placed on each shelf of the cart. The information system consists of E-ink signs and shelf strips, possibly a display on CartER, the check-out system CheckOUT and Active Spots, which are small areas within reach of a RFID reader with a touch screen for customer interaction. The information system is connected to the Internet and the store's website. The check-out is an Active Spot for non- staff operated payment.
