30|$|Using a low {{coherence}} interferometry (LCI) model, {{a comparison}} of broadband single-Gaussian and multi-Gaussian light sources has been undertaken. For single-Gaussian sources, the axial resolution improves with the source bandwidth, confirming the coherence length relation that the resolution for single Gaussian sources improves with increasing spectral bandwidth. However, narrow bandwidth light sources result in interferograms with overlapping strata peaks {{and the loss of}} individual strata information. For multiple-Gaussian sources with the same bandwidth, spectral side lobes increase, reducing A-scan reliability to show accurate layer information without eliminating the side lobes. The simulations show the conditions needed for the resolution of strata information for broadband light sources using both single and multiple Gaussian models. The potential to use the model to study optical coherence tomography (OCT) light sources including <b>super</b> <b>luminescent</b> <b>diodes</b> (SLDs), as reviewed in this paper, as well as optical delay lines and sample structures could better characterize these LCI and OCT elements. Forecasting misinformation in the interferogram may allow preliminary corrections. With improvement to the LCI-OCT model, more applications are envisaged.|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of {{wavelength division multiplexing}} (WDM) to satisfy the increasing demand in the capacity of optical fiber network systems, has created an intense interest to demonstrate multi-wavelength, high bit rate laser sources operating at 1. 5 pm [l] and to qualify them in transmission experiments [2, 3]. Multi-wavelength sources have so far been demonstrated using spectrum slicing with LEDs [4], <b>super</b> <b>luminescent</b> <b>diodes</b> [5], amplified spontaneous emission from EDFAs [6] or supercontinuum generation in fiber [7]. An advantage of spectrum slicing is that it forces relative wavelength stability between oscillating modes. A different approach that preserves relative wavelength stability has also been investigated and in this the multi-wavelength signal is obtained directly from actively mode-locked laser oscillators that use hettxogeneously broadened gain media [8, 9]. An important feature of this technique {{is that all the}} mode-locked wavelengths are simultaneously timed to the modulation signal and therefore synchronized to each other. In this communication we demonstrate a compact fiber ring laser which generates 10 simultaneously mode-locked and synchronized wavelengths channels, each at 30 GHz producing nearly transform limited 7 ps pulses with less than 5 % power variation between them. The principle of operation and the performance of the source presented here are based on three observations. The first observation is tha...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of impact damage in fibre reinforced composites is of significant concern because such damage {{can reduce the}} load-bearing ability of the composite. A number of factors can influence {{the nature and extent}} of impact damage development in composites including: (a) the type of reinforcing fibre and resin system; (b) the magnitude of the residual (fabrication) stresses; (c) the lay-up sequence; and (d) other factors such as the nature of the impactor, impact velocity, impact energy, temperature, moisture content in the composites, etc. From a structural health monitoring point of view, it is necessary to investigate the distribution of damage through the thickness of the composite. This paper reports on a simple, partially multiplexed optical fibre strain sensor system for in-situ strain and residual strain measurements in a carbon fibre reinforced epoxy composite. An extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometric (EFPI) sensor design was used along with single-mode fibres. The multiplexing scheme was based on wavelength division via the use of two <b>super</b> <b>luminescent</b> <b>diodes</b> (SLDs) at different wavelengths. A low-cost fibre optic CCD spectrometer was used as the detector. The multiplexing scheme was demonstrated using two EFPI sensors. In principle, a number of EFPI sensors can be multiplexed using the proposed scheme provided that each sensor is illuminated at a specified and different wavelength. The feasibility of detecting the residual strain in the composite was demonstrated successfully at two specified positions within a 16 -ply carbon fibre reinforced composite panel. Preliminary results indicated that the sensor system was also capable of detecting the effects of a 3. 2 J impact. Excellent correlation was obtained between the EFPI sensor output and that obtained using surface mounted strain gauges...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} {{a number of}} multi-band coronagraph experiments using a vacuum chamber and a binary-shaped pupil mask which in principle should work at all wavelengths, {{in the context of}} the research and development on a coronagraph to observe extra-solar planets (exoplanets) directly. The aim of this work is to demonstrate that subtraction of Point Spread Function (PSF) and multi-band experiments using a binary-shaped pupil mask coronagraph would help improve the contrast in the observation of exoplanets. A checkerboard mask, a kind of binary-shaped pupil mask, was used. We improved the temperature stability by installing the coronagraph optics in a vacuum chamber, controlling the temperature of the optical bench, and covering the vacuum chamber with thermal insulation layers. We evaluated how much the PSF subtraction contributes to the high contrast observation by subtracting the images obtained through the coronagraph. We also carried out multi- band experiments in order to demonstrate a more realistic observation using <b>Super</b> <b>luminescent</b> Light Emitting <b>Diodes</b> (SLEDs) with center wavelengths of 650 nm, 750 nm, 800 nm and 850 nm. A contrast of 2. 3 x 10 - 7 was obtained for the raw coronagraphic image and a contrast of 1. 3 x 10 - 9 was achieved after PSF subtraction with a He-Ne laser at 632. 8 nm wavelength. Thus, the contrast was improved by around two orders of magnitude from the raw contrast by subtracting the PSF. We achieved contrasts of 3. 1 x 10 - 7, 1. 1 x 10 - 6, 1. 6 x 10 - 6 and 2. 5 x 10 - 6 at the bands of 650 nm, 750 nm, 800 nm and 850 nm, respectively, in the multi-band experiments. The results show that contrast within each of the wavelength bands was significantly improved compared with non-coronagraphic optics. We demonstrated PSF subtraction is potentially beneficial for improving contrast of the coronagraph, and this coronagraph produces a significant improvement in contrast with multi-band light sources.

The SLD is a broadband source which is spatially dispersed across a surface using a reflective grating and scan lens.

40|$|We {{describe}} a Hartmann wavefront sensor that can measure {{changes in a}} wavefront with a sensitivity of λ/ 16, 000 at λ= 850 nm. We also demonstrate its application to the measurement of an ultra small change in wavefront and show that the result agrees with that expected to within λ/ 6, 800. Copyright OCIS codes DRAFT Hartmann wavefront sensors, first described in 1904 [1], and particularly the Shack-Hartmann derivatives, have enjoyed a recent surge of popularity due to improvements in the speed, quality and size of CCD arrays. They are currently used {{for a variety of}} applications, including lens metrology [2], ophthalmology [3], adaptive optics [4] and the measurement of thermal lensing [5, 6]. The measurement of wavefront distortion induced by absorption in the optics of advanced gravitational wave interferometers (GWI) is a particularly demanding application, requiring a sensitivity of at least λ/ 467 at λ= 1064 nm [7]. The type of Hartmann sensor used for an application is usually dictated by the intensity of the available light source. The Shack-Hartmann sensor uses a micro-lens array to sample the wavefront and thus optimizes the light collection efficiency but is susceptible to imperfections in the micro-lens array [8]. The conventional Hartmann sensor, which samples the wavefront using an opaque plate containing an array of holes, is less light efficient but is simple to optimize and, as shown here, capable of superior performance.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} clinical {{images from}} a prototype ultrahigh resolution (UHR) combined coronal optical coherence tomography/confocal scanning ophthalmoscope (OCT/SLO) and to {{compare them to}} standard-resolution OCT/SLO images on the same patients. Design: Cross-sectional pilot-study. Participants: Sixty-six eyes of 42 patients with various macular pathologies, such as age-related macular degeneration, macular edema, macular hole, central serous retinopathy, epiretinal membrane and posterior vitreous traction syndrome. Methods: Each subject was first scanned with a standard-resolution OCT/SLO that has an axial resolution of ∼ 10 micron. Immediately following, patients were scanned with the prototype UHR OCT/SLO device. The UHR system employs a compact <b>super</b> <b>luminescent</b> <b>diode</b> (SLD) with a 150 nm bandwidth centered at 890 nm, which allows imaging of the retina with an axial resolution of 3 microns. Both coronal and longitudinal OCT scans were acquired with each system, and compared side-by-side. Scan quality was assessed for the observer's ability to visualize the vitreo-retinal interface and retinal layers - in particular of the outer retina/RPE/choroidal interface, increased discrimination of pathological changes, and better signal intensity. Main outcome measures: Ultrahigh and standard-resolution coronal and longitudinal OCT/SLO images of macular pathologies. Results: In the side-by-side comparison with the commercial standard-resolution OCT/SLO images, the scans in the Ultrahigh resolution OCT/SLO images were superior in 85 % of cases. Relatively poor quality images were attributed to lower signal-to-noise ratio, limited focusing, or media opacities. Several images that had a better signal intensity in the standard-resolution OCT/SLO system were found to show more retinal detail in the UHR system. In general, intraretinal layers in the UHR OCT/SLO images were better delineated in both coronal and longitudinal scans. Enhanced details were also seen in the outer retina/RPE/choroidal complex. The UHR OCT/SLO system produced better definition of morphological changes in several macular pathologies. Conclusions: Broadband SLD-based UHR OCT/SLO offers a compact, efficient, and economic enhancement to the currently available clinical OCT imaging systems.

40|$|Investigation of {{mechanical}} properties of single molecule junctions {{is crucial to}} develop an understanding and enable control of single molecular junctions. This work presents an experimental and analytical approach that enables the statistical evaluation of force and simultaneous conductance data of metallic atomic point contacts and molecular junctions. A conductive atomic force microscope based break junction technique is developed to form single molecular junctions and collect conductance and force data simultaneously. Improvements of the optical components have been achieved {{through the use of}} a <b>super</b> <b>luminescent</b> <b>diode,</b> enabling tremendous increases in force resolution. An experimental procedure to collect data for various molecular junctions has been developed and includes deposition, calibration, and analysis methods. For the statistical analysis of force, novel approaches based on two dimensional histograms and a direct force identification method are presented. The two dimensional method allows for an unbiased evaluation of force events that are identified using corresponding conductance signatures. This is not always possible however, and in these situations, the force based identification of junction rearrangement events is an attractive alternative method. This combined experimental and analytical approach is then applied to three studies: First, the impact of molecular backbones to the mechanical behavior of single molecule junctions is investigated and it is found that junctions formed with identical linkers but different backbone structure result in junctions with varying breaking forces. All molecules used show a clear molecular signature and force data can be evaluated using the 2 D method. Second, the effects of the linker group used to attach molecules to gold electrodes are investigated. A study of four alkane molecules with different linkers finds a drastic difference in the evolution of donor acceptor and covalently bonded molecules respectively. In fact, the covalent bond is found to significantly distort the metal electrode rearrangement such that junction rearrangement events can no longer be identified with a clean and well defined conductance signature. For this case, the force based identification process is used. Third, results for break junction measurements with different metals are presented. It is found that silver and palladium junctions rupture with forces different from those of gold contacts. In the case of silver experiments in ambient conditions, we can also identify oxygen impurities in the silver contact formation process, leading to force and conductance measurements of silver-oxygen structures. For the future, this work provides an experimental and analytical foundation that will enable insights into single molecule systems not previously accessible...|$|E
40|$|The {{transparency}} {{of the human}} cornea is vital in maintaining vision. The cells on the surface, corneal epithelium cells, are constantly replaced by differentiated limbal stem cells. Damage to the limbus can cause a deficiency in the limbal stem cell population which can cause cornea opacity and vascularisation consequently leading to blindness. Currently limbal stem cell deficiency can be detected clinically and treated surgically by transplanting stem cells onto the damaged cornea. However, the long term success rate is low 68 % and the results vary from patient to patient. There is an interest to understand the cause for this variability in results and the low long term success rates. The aim {{of the project was}} to develop an Ultrahigh resolution OCT (UHROCT) to locate the transplanted corneal epithelium cells. Optical Coherence Tomography system (OCT) is a non-invasive micron resolution imaging technique that can image several millimetres in tissue. The cells to be transplanted are labelled with super paramagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles. After uptake these SPIO embedded cells are displaced with an external magnetic field at a known frequency whilst being imaged by the UHROCT. This technique known as phased resolved magnetomotive OCT, allowed us to locate the oscillating nanoparticle which is embedded in the cell by detecting the location of the modulation frequency. For the Ultrahigh resolution OCT a <b>super</b> <b>luminescent</b> <b>diode</b> (SLD) light with centre wavelength at 890 e- 9 m and a bandwidth of 150 e- 9 m.

40|$|Since their invention, sensors {{based on}} optical fibers are {{powerful}} and versatile devices. Nowadays {{they play a}} fundamental role in many different fields, e. g., telecommunication, civil engineering, science research and more. Wide applications are related to the possibility of realize the so called Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG). A FBG is a fiber in which a Bragg grating is created: this is a periodic modulation of the refractive index of the fiber core, that acts like a band-rejection filter with respect to the light travelling into the fiber. This particular kind of structure allows to realize several optical devices like Fabry-P ́ erot or Circulator. High reflectivity FBG can be also used as mirrors at the ends of a doped fiber to create fiber laser. The grating period and, consequently, the reflected and transmitted wavelengths, depend on the temperature variation and fiber dilatation or contraction. Observing the wavelength shift it is possible to evaluate the temperature changes or the fiber elongation, this make the FBG a thermometer and a strain gauge. Moreover we can measure external perturbations converting them into fiber strain by a suitable system. So FBGs can be used in devices like flow-meter, magnetic/electric field meter etc. Relevant applications of FBGs can be found in geology and geophysics. Within these fields, in particular, there is a project that is planning to use them as strain sensors: MEDiterranean SUpersite Volcanoes (MED-SUV), an European project under the coordination of European Plate Observing System (EPOS). This project, together with FUTUREVOLC and MARsite, plans to enhance the current knowledge bout geohazards, in order to improve the scientific institutions capacity in preventing the damage on environment and population. MED-SUV is focused on the study of Italian volcanoes: CampiFlogei/Vesuvius and Etna. As a general framework, this thesis is involved in the MED-SUV project, which studies mount Etna. In collaboration with Marwan Technology, a spin-off company of the Department of Physics of Pisa niversity, we have realized a tri-axial strain gauge sensor and the interrogating system that controls it. The sensor is designed to measure the rock movements along the three Cartesian axes. This kind of measurement requires that the sensor is installed in hostile environment, on the slope of mount Etna. For these reasons, the project specifications for the building of sensor and interrogation system are: low cost, low energetic consumption and reduced dimension. In particular, the last parameter is due to the necessity of installing the sensor {{in the bottom of a}} 10 meter borehole, dug in the basalt rock. The interrogation system has been realized with the cooperation of the Osservatorio Vesuviano, whose researchers realized the ”GILDA datalogger”, expressly studied to work in hostile environment and that will be use as acquisition system. To interrogate the response of the FBGs, we have assembled an opto-electronic device based on a <b>super</b> <b>luminescent</b> <b>diode,</b> as light source, an Array Waveguide Grating (AWG) as wavelength discriminator, and six photodiodes, to convert light signal into voltage difference. Using energy-saving components, solar panels and battery this interrogation system is designed to work unattended for months. We successfully tested it the in laboratory, verifying that the sensor can measure strain with a sensitivity of the order of 0. 5 [με] and a dynamic range of 120 [με]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An {{effective}} optical {{read out}} approach based on fiber reflective {{is presented to}} detect bends of a biomaterial microcantilever. The microcantilever was fabricated on single crystalline SOI wafer using a series of side definitions and backside wet/dry etchings. A Cr/Au layer with 30 nm Cr and 50 nm Au layer was deposited for the immobilized of bimolecular on the cantilever surface and for reflecting the light back into the fiber, the different light intensities means different bimolecular concentrations. The noncoherent light source is a <b>super</b> <b>luminescent</b> LED. Gradient index lens as a collimator and 50 : 50 optical coupler and signal modefiber was used to transmit light. Two PINFETs were used to convert the reflecting the light intensities and the light sources into electronic signals, two ADCs convert the signal into digital signals, a MPU was used to eliminate the fluctuation of the light source error. The method can has got high sensitivity is 6507. 59 mV/um. Though the experiment, the cantilever biosensor can detect glucose, measurement results clearly demonstrate that the output voltage induced by the microcantilevers bending {{is proportional to the}} glucose concentrations and the sensitivity is up to 0. 1 V/mM, which is enough for glucose real-time trace detection.

40|$|A {{new method}} for early caries {{diagnosis}} was proposed and tested through a home-made optical examination systemthat used quantitative light fluorescence (QLF) and digital imaging fiber optic transillumination (FOTI) (DIFOTI),with light sources {{across a wide}} spectral range, from 350 nm to 1, 000 nm. The front-illuminated infrared lightscattering image (FIR) showed similar diagnostic abilities to that of DIFOTI. The FIR method was invented based onthe observation that caries lesions lose the high transmittance and low scattering properties of benign enamel tissue. There are various methods for the early diagnosis of caries, such as visual examination, exploration, X-ray radiography,QLF, FOTI, and infrared fluorescence (diagnodent). Among them, methods based on optical properties are regarded ashaving the most potential. A comparative study was performed between the FOTI, QLF, diagnodent, optical coherencetomography, and FIR scattering image methods, using 20 extracted teeth samples with early caries. A scale of lesionmeasurement based on optical image contrast was proposed. The statistical analysis showed a significant correlationbetween the DIFOTI and FIR methods (r = 0. 35, p < 0. 05). However, the QLF and diagnodent methods showed littleassociation with FIR images, as they have different detection principles as compared with FIR. Tomographic imagesobtained by OCT, using 1, 330 nm <b>super</b> <b>luminescent</b> LED as a gold standard of tooth structure, verified that the FOTIand FIR results correctly represented the lack of homogeneity in dental tissue. The newly proposed FIR methodattained similar diagnostic results to those of FOTI, but with an easier approach...|$|R
40|$|Aberrations affect {{image quality}} of the eye away from the line of sight as well as along it. High amounts of lower order aberrations {{are found in the}} {{peripheral}} visual field and higher order aberrations change away from the centre of the visual field. Peripheral resolution is poorer than that in central vision, but peripheral vision is important for movement and detection tasks (for example driving) which are adversely affected by poor peripheral image quality. Any physiological process or intervention that affects axial image quality will affect peripheral image quality as well. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of accommodation, myopia, age, and refractive interventions of orthokeratology, laser in situ keratomileusis and intraocular lens implantation on the peripheral aberrations of the eye. This is the first systematic investigation of peripheral aberrations in a variety of subject groups. Peripheral aberrations can be measured either by rotating a measuring instrument relative to the eye or rotating the eye relative to the instrument. I used the latter as it is much easier to do. To rule out effects of eye rotation on peripheral aberrations, I investigated the effects of eye rotation on axial and peripheral cycloplegic refraction using an open field autorefractor. For axial refraction, the subjects fixated at a target straight ahead, while their heads were rotated by ± 30 º with a compensatory eye rotation to view the target. For peripheral refraction, the subjects rotated their eyes to fixate on targets out to ± 34 ° along the horizontal visual field, followed by measurements in which they rotated their heads such that the eyes stayed in the primary position relative to the head while fixating at the peripheral targets. Oblique viewing did not affect axial or peripheral refraction. Therefore it is not critical, within the range of viewing angles studied, if axial and peripheral refractions are measured with rotation of the eye relative to the instrument or rotation of the instrument relative to the eye. Peripheral aberrations were measured using a commercial Hartmann-Shack aberrometer. A number of hardware and software changes were made. The 1. 4 mm range limiting aperture was replaced by a larger aperture (2. 5 mm) to ensure all the light from peripheral parts of the pupil reached the instrument detector even when aberrations were high such as those occur in peripheral vision. The power of the <b>super</b> <b>luminescent</b> <b>diode</b> source was increased to improve detection of spots passing through the peripheral pupil. A beam splitter was placed between the subjects and the aberrometer, through which they viewed an array of targets on a wall or projected on a screen in a 6 row x 7 column matrix of points covering a visual field of 42 x 32. In peripheral vision, the pupil of the eye appears elliptical rather than circular; data were analysed off-line using custom software to determine peripheral aberrations. All analyses in the study were conducted for 5. 0 mm pupils. Influence of accommodation on peripheral aberrations was investigated in young emmetropic subjects by presenting fixation targets at 25 cm and 3 m (4. 0 D and 0. 3 D accommodative demands, respectively). Increase in accommodation did not affect the patterns of any aberrations across the field, but there was overall negative shift in spherical aberration across the visual field of 0. 10 ± 0. 01 m. Subsequent studies were conducted with the targets at a 1. 2 m distance. Young emmetropes, young myopes and older emmetropes exhibited similar patterns of astigmatism and coma across the visual field. However, the rate of change of coma across the field was higher in young myopes than young emmetropes and was highest in older emmetropes amongst the three groups. Spherical aberration showed an overall decrease in myopes and increase in older emmetropes across the field, as compared to young emmetropes. Orthokeratology, spherical IOL implantation and LASIK altered peripheral higher order aberrations considerably, especially spherical aberration. Spherical IOL implantation resulted in an overall increase in spherical aberration across the field. Orthokeratology and LASIK reversed the direction of change in coma across the field. Orthokeratology corrected peripheral relative hypermetropia through correcting myopia in the central visual field. Theoretical ray tracing demonstrated that changes in aberrations due to orthokeratology and LASIK can be explained by the induced changes in radius of curvature and asphericity of the cornea. This investigation has shown that peripheral aberrations can be measured with reasonable accuracy with eye rotation relative to the instrument. Peripheral aberrations are affected by accommodation, myopia, age, orthokeratology, spherical intraocular lens implantation and laser in situ keratomileusis. These factors affect the magnitudes and patterns of most aberrations considerably (especially coma and spherical aberration) across the studied visual field. The changes in aberrations across the field may influence peripheral detection and motion perception. However, further research is required to investigate how the changes in aberrations influence peripheral detection and motion perception and consequently peripheral vision task performance...|$|E
