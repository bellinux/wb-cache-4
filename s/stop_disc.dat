S 5. 8 OBJECTIVE: Low {{back pain}} {{is a global}} concern with {{tremendous}} socioeconomic implications which may severely diminish functional activity, decrease quality of life, lead to loss of wages, and increase health-care costs [1]. Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is a factor strongly associated with low back pain. Composed of a central nucleus pulposus (NP) rich in proteoglycan (PG) content (protein core with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)) and an outer fibrous annulus fibrosus (AF), the IVD has been noted to degenerate as characterized by biochemical and morphological changes [2 - 3]. Loss of GAGs is known as an initiating factor in degenerative disc disease (DDD), followed by {{the reduction of the}} osmotic pressure and shrinkage of the disc height as a consequence. As {{it has been suggested that}} treatment can only <b>stop</b> <b>disc</b> degeneration but not reverse it, it is essential to diagnose early degenerative changes at the stage of GAGs loss by non-invasively quantifying the GAGs content.

50|$|Most new {{mountain}} bikes use disc brakes.

40|$|Protostellar discs {{may become}} massive enough to {{fragment}} producing secondary low-mass objects: planets, brown dwarfs and low-mass stars. We study {{the effect of}} radiative feedback from such newly-formed secondary objects using radiative hydrodynamic simulations. We compare the results of simulations without any radiative feedback from secondary objects with those where two types of radiative feedback are considered: (i) continuous, and (ii) episodic. We find that: (i) continuous radiative feedback stabilizes the disc and suppresses further fragmentation, reducing the number secondary objects formed; (ii) episodic feedback from secondary objects heats and stabilises the disc when the outburst occurs, but shortly after the outburst <b>stops,</b> the <b>disc</b> becomes unstable and fragments again. However, fewer secondary objects are formed compared to the the case without radiative feedback. We also find that the mass growth of secondary objects is mildly suppressed due {{to the effect of}} their radiative feedback. However, their mass growth also depends on where they form in the disc and on their subsequent interactions, such that their final masses are not drastically different from the case without radiative feedback. We find that the masses of secondary objects formed by disc fragmentation are from a few M_ J to a few 0. 1 M_. Planets formed by fragmentation tend to be ejected from the disc. We conclude that planetary-mass objects on wide orbits (wide-orbit planets) are unlikely to form by disc fragmentation. Nevertheless, disc fragmentation may be a significant source of free-floating planets and brown dwarfs. Comment: 19 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables, accepted by MNRA...|$|R
40|$|Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) {{have shown}} {{promising}} potential to <b>stop</b> intervertebral <b>disc</b> degeneration in several animal models.

Notochordal cells (NCs), influential in disc development, {{have been shown to}} stimulate BMSC differentiation, but it is unclear how this effect will translate in an environment where resident disc cells (nucleus pulposus cells [NPCs]) could also influence BMSCs. The goal of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the effects of NCs on BMSCs when cocultured with NPCs, in a simplified 3 D in vitro system. Bovine BMSCs and NPCs were mixed (Mix) and seeded into alginate beads. Using culture inserts, the Mix was then cocultured with porcine NCs (alginate beads) and compared to coculture with empty beads or porcine skin fibroblasts (SFs, alginate beads). NPCs alone were also cocultured with NCs, and BMSCs alone cultured under chondrogenic conditions. The effects of coculture conditions on cell viability, matrix production (proteoglycan and collagen), and gene expression of disc markers (aggrecan, type II collagen, and SOX 9) were assessed after 4 weeks of culture. The NC phenotype and gene expression profile were also analyzed. Coculture with NCs did not significantly influence cell viability, proteoglycan production, or disc marker gene expression of the Mix. When compared to NPCs, the Mix produced the same amount of proteoglycan and displayed a higher expression of disc marker, indicating a stimulation of the BMSCs (and/or NPCs) in the Mix. Additionally, during the 4 weeks of culture, the NC phenotype changed drastically (morphology, gene expression profile). These results show that NCs might not be as stimulatory for BMSCs in an NPC-rich environment, as believed from individual cultures. This absence of effects could be explained by a mild stimulation provided by (de) differentiating NCs and the costimulation of BMSCs and NPCs by each other...|$|R

The main function of brake {{system is to}} decelerate or <b>stop</b> a car. <b>Disc</b> brake system consist of brake rotor, brake pads and brake calliper. Most of the commercial vehicles use brake calliper made of Gray cast iron which possess heavy weight results in high fuel consumption. Another major problem is calliper being deflection during clamping action, known as “bending of bridge” will results in extended pedal travel since additional braking fluid volume is required to compensate for deflections, reduce comfort, driving feelings and safety of vehicle. The demand of Metal Matrix Composites (MMC) is greatly increased in automotive industry since it having a lower density, higher strength and comparable modulus of elasticity as compared to Gray cast iron. The objective of this thesis is to study the advantages of Magnesium hybrid MMC to replace conventional brake calliper and proposed few innovative design alternatives for automotive industry. This is done by creating an original brake calliper and validate for appropriate material using Finite Element Analysis (FEA), followed by select optimum design. In design selection, Quality Function Deployment (QFD) approach was used to rank the design parameters, few alternative designs were created using CatiaV 5 R 17 and analyzed for static structural analysis using FEA. In the end, best floating brake calliper design among those alternative designs was selected using Super Decision software.

40|$|Introduction. Previous small scale, non-population based {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that asymptomatic subjects can have a high incidence of MRI changes. To date, no direct relationship could be identified between low back pain and MRI changes. As part of a large scale genetic study, we have recruited a large number of volunteers for MRI scans of the lumbar spine. Subsequent microsatellite marker analysis confirmed that the sample was representative of the local population. This study aims {{to examine the relationship between}} MRI changes and low back pain. Method. Volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55 were invited for MRI scanning of the lumbar spine. A detailed pain history was taken from each subject including assessment by Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Roland Morris score (RM), visual analogue scale (VAS) and SF 36. All the scans were read by 2 experienced physicians blinded to the study information. Severity of degeneration at each level was graded using the Schneiderman’s classification, and the score for each disc was summated to give a total “DDD” score for the lumbar spine. Correlation between MRI changes and symptoms were attempted. Results. Overall 1043 subjects were recruited, of which 525 had at least one episode of LBP, but only 177 were currently in pain. An increase in the DDD score on MRI was directly related to an increase in the proportion of subjects with LBP, their ODI and VAS, but not their RM or SF 36 scores. Discussion. This is the first large scale population study that demonstrates a relationship between the occurrence of LBP and MRI findings of degenerative disc disease. This relationship is revealed by some but not all measured pain parameters, the reason for this is the subject of further analysis.

40|$|An {{important}} part of automobile safety is the braking system. Disc brakes {{have been widely used}} in automobiles for sped retardation for over 30 years. During that time, they have developed from a simple disc to a complex disc with channels, vanes, holes and grooves. The <b>stopping</b> capability of <b>disc</b> brakes is affected by the rate at which heat is dissipated by forced convection and the thermal capacity of the rotor. Catastrophic failure of brake rotors can occur during rapid increases or decreases in rotor temperature where regions of high temperature gradients result in high thermal strains. There is little information in the public domain regarding the relative merits of different disc brake rotor geometries, particularly in terms of airflow patterns, heat transfer rates, and internal thermal gradients. The aim of this research project was to investigate how geometrical variations affect the thermal performance of bi-directional disc brake rotors, particularly for high performance applications. Dynamometer testing showed that respectable increases in braking performance are achievable with relatively simple machining modifications. Tuft and smoke visualization techniques provided a preliminary understanding of the airflow in the passages of three distinct bi-directional rotor designs. Particle Image Velocimetry was used for detailed flow measurements which supported the numerical simulations. Computational Fluid Dynamics was used to predict the airflow and heat transfer associated with eight bi-directional brake rotor designs. The results show that 'pillared' passage designs can achieve higher heat transfer rates than traditional straight radial vane designs and that the heat loss from pillared rotors is generally more uniform than from vaned rotors. Subsequent conjugate heat transfer simulations found that temperature gradients inside pillared rotors are typically lower than inside vaned rotors. Thus failure rates due to excessive thermal strain are expected to be lower for pillared rotors. It was shown that rotor selection based solely on heat transfer rates is inappropriate and different passage designs are suited to different applications. The findings of this research will directly benefit local disc brake manufacturers, who do not have resources to conduct thorough studies comparing the thermal characteristics of different brake rotor designs...|$|R

Three recessive lethal alleles (dco^ 2, dco^ 3, and dco^(18)) in heteroallelic combinations and one allele (dco^ 3) when homozygous cause the imaginal discs {{to continue to grow}} beyond the normal disc-intrinsic limit during an extended larval period. Some degeneration also occurs in the overgrowing discs. The discs overgrow even when transplanted early in their development into wild-type hosts, whereas normal <b>discs</b> <b>stop</b> growth at about the normal final size under such conditions, indicating that the overgrowth is a disc-autonomous effect of the mutations. During overgrowth the imaginal discs retain their single-layered epithelial structure except near regions of degeneration, and they differentiate into disc-appropriate but abnormal adult structures when transplanted into wild-type larval hosts. When the mutant larvae are reared under certain conditions a small percentage develop to the pharate adult stage, and these animals show a characteristic syndrome of abnormalities including swollen leg segments with many extra bristles, small or missing eyes, duplicated antennae and palpi, and separated vesicles of cuticle. A fourth recessive lethal allele (dco^(le 88)), when homozygous or in heteroallelic combination with the overgrowth alleles, causes the imaginal discs to degenerate, producing a “discless” phenotype. Gap junction-mediated communication was assayed by observing the intercellular transfer of injected fluorescein complexon (dye coupling). Dye coupling in the imaginal discs of the dco genotypes that cause overgrowth was dramatically reduced at 4 days after egg laying (AEL) compared with wild-type controls. Coupling was more normal although still significantly reduced at 7 – 8 and 12 – 14 days AEL. In c 43 ^(hs 1), another disc overgrowth mutant, the imaginal disc cells also showed very reduced dye coupling at 4 days and incomplete coupling at 9 days. In contrast, discs from wild-type larvae, two other imaginal disc overgrowth mutants, and a cell death mutant showed extensive dye coupling at all stages tested. Electron microscopic morphometry revealed a reduction in gap-junction length per unit lateral plasma membrane length in dco 3 dco 18 and c 43 ^(hs 1) wing discs, although not in dco 2 dco 3, compared with wild-type wing discs.

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple {{model for the}} origin of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies (ETG) within the {{hierarchical}} &# 0923;cold dark matter (&# 0923;CDM) scenario, {{that is based on}} the assumption that the mass fraction of stellar discs in ETGs is a proxy for the specific angular momentum expressed via &# 0955;R. Within our model we reproduce the fraction of fast and slow rotators as a function of magnitude in the ATLAS 3 D survey, assuming that fast-rotating ETGs have at least 10 per cent of their total stellar mass in a disc component. In agreement with ATLAS 3 D observations we find that slow rotators are predominantly galaxies with M* > 1010. 5 M&# 8857; contributing &# 8764; 20 per cent to the overall ETG population. We show in detail that the growth histories of fast and slow rotators are different, supporting the classification of ETGs into these two categories. Slow rotators accrete between &# 8764; 50 and 90 per cent of their stellar mass from satellites and their most massive progenitors have on average up to three major mergers during their evolution. Fast rotators in contrast accrete less than 50 per cent and have on average less than one major merger in their past. We find that the underlying physical reason for the different growth histories is the slowing down and ultimately complete shut-down of gas cooling in massive galaxies. Once cooling and associated star formation in <b>disc</b> <b>stop,</b> galaxies grow via infall from satellites. Frequent minor mergers thereby destroy existing stellar discs via violent relaxation and also tend to lower the specific angular momentum of the main stellar body, lowering &# 0955;R into the slow rotator regime. On average, the last gas-rich major merger interaction in slow rotators happens at z > 1. 5, followed by a series of minor mergers. These results support the idea that kinematically decoupled cores (KDC) form during gas-rich major mergers at high z followed by minor mergers, which build-up the outer layers of the remnant, and make remnants that are initially too flat compared to observations become rounder. Fast rotators are less likely to form such KDCs due to the fact that they have on average less than one major merger in their past. Fast rotators in our model have different formation paths. The majority, 78 per cent, has bulge-to-total stellar mass ratios (B/T) > 0. 5 and managed to grow stellar discs due to continued gas cooling or bulges due to frequent minor mergers. The remaining 22 per cent live in high-density environments and consist of low B/T galaxies with gas fractions below 15 per cent, that have exhausted their cold gas reservoir and have no hot halo from which gas can cool.

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple {{model for the}} origin of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies (ETG) within the {{hierarchical}} Λcold dark matter (ΛCDM) scenario, {{that is based on}} the assumption that the mass fraction of stellar discs in ETGs is a proxy for the specific angular momentum expressed via λR. Within our model we reproduce the fraction of fast and slow rotators as a function of magnitude in the ATLAS 3 D survey, assuming that fast-rotating ETGs have at least 10 per cent of their total stellar mass in a disc component. In agreement with ATLAS 3 D observations we find that slow rotators are predominantly galaxies with M* > 1010. 5 M⊙ contributing ~ 20 per cent to the overall ETG population. We show in detail that the growth histories of fast and slow rotators are different, supporting the classification of ETGs into these two categories. Slow rotators accrete between ~ 50 and 90 per cent of their stellar mass from satellites and their most massive progenitors have on average up to three major mergers during their evolution. Fast rotators in contrast accrete less than 50 per cent and have on average less than one major merger in their past. We find that the underlying physical reason for the different growth histories is the slowing down and ultimately complete shut-down of gas cooling in massive galaxies. Once cooling and associated star formation in <b>disc</b> <b>stop,</b> galaxies grow via infall from satellites. Frequent minor mergers thereby destroy existing stellar discs via violent relaxation and also tend to lower the specific angular momentum of the main stellar body, lowering λR into the slow rotator regime. On average, the last gas-rich major merger interaction in slow rotators happens at z > 1. 5, followed by a series of minor mergers. These results support the idea that kinematically decoupled cores (KDC) form during gas-rich major mergers at high z followed by minor mergers, which build-up the outer layers of the remnant, and make remnants that are initially too flat compared to observations become rounder. Fast rotators are less likely to form such KDCs due to the fact that they have on average less than one major merger in their past. Fast rotators in our model have different formation paths. The majority, 78 per cent, has bulge-to-total stellar mass ratios (B/T) > 0. 5 and managed to grow stellar discs due to continued gas cooling or bulges due to frequent minor mergers. The remaining 22 per cent live in high-density environments and consist of low B/T galaxies with gas fractions below 15 per cent, that have exhausted their cold gas reservoir and have no hot halo from which gas can cool. These fast rotators most likely resemble the flattened disc-like fast rotators in the ATLAS 3 D survey. Our results predict that ETGs can change their state from fast to slow rotator and vice versa, while the former is taking place predominantly at low z (z 1010 M⊙) fast rotators being more than one order of magnitude more frequent at z~ 2. © 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society © 2011 RAS...|$|R
