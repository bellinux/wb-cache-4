50|$|Pipe {{recovery}} {{is a specific}} wireline operation used in {{the oil and gas}} industry, when the drill string becomes stuck downhole. <b>Stuck</b> <b>pipe</b> prevents the drill rig from continuing operations. This results in costly downtime, ranging anywhere from $10,000-1,000,000 per day of downtime, therefore it is critical to resolve the problem as quickly as possible. Pipe {{recovery is}} the process by which the location of the <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe</b> is identified, and the free pipe is separated from the <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe.</b> This allows fishing tools to subsequently be run down hole to latch onto and remove the <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{geological}} formation downhole occasionally has a significantly lower pressure than the drilling fluid being used. When the pipe string comes {{into contact with}} the exposed formation the difference in pressure will cause the pipe to be sucked against the formation. If the rig is able to circulate drilling fluid back to the surface that is often a good indication of differentially <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe.</b> One technique for freeing the <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe,</b> or avoiding the issue to begin with, is to rotate the pipe string while pulling out of the hole.|$|E

Indeed, at times he seriously thought of {{accepting}} the invitation extended by the Great Chief at Washington immediately after the massacre of his soldiers, and once more revisiting the haunts of civilization, His soul sickened in feverish inactivity; schoolmasters palled on his taste; he had introduced baseball, blind hooky, marbles, and peg-top among his Indian subjects, but only with indifferent success. The squaws persisted in boring holes through the china alleys and wearing them as necklaces; his warriors <b>stuck</b> <b>pipes</b> in their baseball bats, and made war-clubs of them. He could not but feel, too, that the gentle Mushymush, although devoted to her paleface brother, was deficient in culinary education. Her mince-pies were abominable; her jam far inferior to that made by his Aunt Sally of Doemville. Only an unexpected incident kept him equally from the extreme of listless sybaritic indulgence or of morbid cynicism.

5000|$|Once {{the free}} {{point of a}} <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe</b> string is determined, the stringshot {{back-off}} service {{can be used to}} remove the free portion from the well. The string-shot is a metal rod wrapped in explosive primer cord. The back-off procedure applies left-hand torque to the <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe</b> string. The CCL is used to help position the string shot at the predetermined pipe joint, and then the string shot is detonated. [...] The explosion produces a similar effect as an intense hammer blow and allows the joint to be unscrewed at the proper connection. Several factors such as pipe size, weight and condition, back-off depth, mud or borehole fluid weight and well temperature are carefully considered when making up the proper string-shot assembly.|$|E

50|$|The term {{free point}} {{is used to}} {{describe}} the delineating point between the <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe</b> and the free pipe in a pipe string. Every joint of pipe above the free point is free, meaning it can rotate freely and be moved {{in and out of the}} hole, provided it was not attached to the remaining joints of <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe</b> below the free point. A good way to visualize this is to hold a piece of string with your left hand. With your right hand grab the bottom third of that string. The 2/3rds of the string above your right hand would be considered free, since you can move the string however you may like. The section of string inside and below your right hand is stuck, since no matter what you do to the free string it will not affect the string in or below your right hand.|$|E
50|$|Differential {{sticking}} is {{a problem}} that occurs when drilling a well with a greater well bore pressure than formation pressure, as is usually the case. The drill pipe is pressed against the wellbore wall so that part of its circumference will see only reservoir pressure, while the rest will continue to be pushed by wellbore pressure. As a result, the pipe becomes stuck to the wall, and can require millions of pounds of force to remove, which may prove impossible. In many cases the drilling fluid (mud) weight is reduced, thus relieving the pressure difference and releasing the <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe</b> string. Should this option be unavailable, as in sour gas wells, a specialty fishing company is called to retrieve the <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe</b> or 'fish'. Many options exist once a fishing company is on site: oil or nitrogen may be pumped down the well, or the fish may be 'washed over' using a carbide shoe on a string of washpipe. Jarring is not usually attempted with differential sticking due to the massive amount of pressure that holds the pipe in place.|$|E

5000|$|Initially during startup of a vibrator, some {{force is}} {{necessary}} to lift and lower the entire load mass of the system. When the vibrator tunes to the resonant frequency of the system, the reactive load impedance cancels out to zero {{by virtue of the}} inductance reactance (mass of the system) equaling the compliance or stiffness reactance (elasticity of the tubular). The remaining impedance of the system, known as the resistive load impedance, is what is retaining the <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This mud type {{can be used}} as a {{completion}} and workover fluid, a spotting fluid to relieve a <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe</b> and as packer or casing fluid.

5000|$|During pipe vibration, Dilation and Contraction of {{the pipe}} body, known as Poisson's ratio, takes place such that when the <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe</b> is {{subjected}} to axial strain due to stretching, its diameter will contract. Similarly, when the length of pipe is compressed, its diameter will expand. Since a length of pipe undergoing vibration experiences alternate tensile and compressive forces as waves along its longitudinal axis (and therefore longitudinal strains), its diameter will expand and contract in unison with the applied tensile and compressive waves. This means that for alternate moments during a vibration cycle the pipe may actually be physically free of its bond.|$|E

30|$|Lost Circulation Problem (LCP), {{also known}} as lost returns, stands for the absence or {{reduction}} of drilling mud pumped through the drillstring while drilling the wells, which filtrates into the formation instead of flowing up to the surface. Historic evidence shows that LCP highly contributes to {{the total cost of}} the mud and the well. Consequences of lost circulation may go from increasing operation costs to a <b>stuck</b> drill <b>pipe,</b> a blowout, reservoir damage and even loss of well. Although lost circulation can be treated by adding plugging and bridging materials [Lost Circulation Materials (LCMs)], to the drilling fluid, huge volume of mud may invade the formation before it can be detected on surface, especially in fractured and unconsolidated formations while drilling with heavy mud.|$|R

50|$|The Halliburton Freepoint Tool {{is based}} around the magnetorestrictive {{property}} of steel. This principle states that when torque or stretch {{is applied to}} free pipe, the magnetization will change. <b>Stuck</b> <b>pipe</b> will have no change in magnetization. There is a magnet {{on the bottom of}} the tool that creates a small magnetic field. There are four co-planar orthogonal multi-axis high sensitivity magnetometers located above the magnet. The magnetometers measure the change in the magnetization of the pipe. The pipe is set at neutral weight, then the tool is run downhole logging the entire pipe string. Once it is at the bottom of the string, torque or stretch is applied to the pipe. The tool is then pulled uphole logging the entire string. The tool will detect differences in the magnetization of the pipe, thereby indicating free and stuck sections of pipe.|$|E

30|$|With {{economic}} development and increasing demand for energy, {{as well as the}} depletion of conventional oil and gas reserves, more and more {{attention has been paid to}} unconventional oil and gas resources (Rajnauth 2012). Shale gas is considered to be an unconventional source due to shale’s typically low porosity and low permeability. Shale gas has been produced at industrial scale in the USA, and the shale gas revolution has swiftly erupted around the world. It has been estimated that the drilled formations are more than 75 % shale (Josh et al. 2012). It is very important to maintain wellbore stability during shale formation drilling (Al-Bazali 2011; Bybee 2009; Díaz-Pérez et al. 2007; Hu et al. 2016; Riley et al. 2012). Ninety percentage of wellbore stability problems are caused by shale formations. Shale formations consist of consolidated clay minerals and contain native fractures and nano-pores. This results in their ultra-low permeability (van Oort 2003; Zhang et al. 2013; Zhong et al. 2011) and serious clay swelling when encountering water, a main factor causing hole collapse, wellbore weakening, and <b>stuck</b> <b>pipes</b> in drilling (Zhong et al. 2015). The composition of clay minerals is a major factor contributing to swelling capability as some clay minerals are non-swelling. For example, smectite is a typical swelling-type clay mineral, but illite and chlorite are non-swelling minerals. The swelling of smectite results in an increase in swelling pressure and is followed by a series of wellbore instability problems. Long horizontal segments aggravate wellbore instability during drilling shale formations due to the swelling of clay minerals. Montmorillonite is a member of the smectite group, and smectite and montmorillonite are often not distinguished. Controlling the swelling of montmorillonite is an effective solution to instability of shale formations.|$|R

40|$|<b>Stuck</b> <b>pipe</b> {{incidents}} {{are a major}} operational concern during most drilling operations. Even when <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe</b> situations are resolved, they usually {{require a lot of}} resources. In the worst case scenario <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe</b> causes loss of the borehole. This Thesis is an investigation of a <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe</b> incident that ultimately led to the loss of an on-shore well drilled in Slovakia. Percussion air hammer technology was used for drilling the hole and foam was occupying the annulus {{at the time of the}} incident. The drillstring became stuck during an emergency tripping out of hole following an accident which led to a personal injury at the site. After the hole was abandoned the cause for becoming stuck was still unclear. 	The thesis aims to decide what caused the pipe to get stuck. First an overview of the situation is established by describing the course of events and essential information about the operation. Acquired information is then analyzed and discussed, noting indications of various <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe</b> causes. The acquired information included hook load logs and cuttings sampled from the well. The cuttings were analyzed with regards to shape, size and type of formation. Cuttings from selected parts of the well were also tested for water reactivity. The indications that were discovered were summarized and compared to possible <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe</b> causes. Fractured formations and reactive formations received the most support from the information that had been provided. Of the two, reactive formations seems more likely due to effectively accounting for type of material found in plug as well as the timing of the incident. Conclusive evidence of a particular cause for the incident could not be determined with confidence. Recommendations for further studies include:&# 149; Further study of <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe</b> cause if additional information exists at a future 		time. &# 149; Creating a diagnostic tool for use in air hammer drilling would help avoiding future <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe</b> incidents. Looking into the correct actions for different <b>stuck</b> <b>pipe</b> causes could also be a part of this study. &# 149; An evaluation of the protocols for air hammer drilling and tripping could uncover potential risks involved in currently used procedures. </p...|$|E
