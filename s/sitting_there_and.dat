500|$|Roger Ebert {{reasoned}} that [...] "part of {{the pleasure of}} movie-going is pure spectacle—of just <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> looking at great stuff and knowing it looks terrific. There wasn't much Schumacher could have done with the story or the music he was handed, but in the areas over which he held sway, he has triumphed." [...] In contrasting between {{the popularity of the}} Broadway musical, Michael Dequina of Film Threat magazine explained that [...] "it conjures up this unexplainable spell that leaves audiences sad, sentimental, swooning, smiling—in some way transported and moved. Now, in Schumacher's film, that spell lives on." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{also spoke}} about O'Neal in 2001 with Rabbi Shmuley. He {{described}} holding hands with her: [...] "I was, like, in heaven. It {{was the most}} magical thing. It was better than kissing her, {{it was better than}} anything." [...] He recalled one of the times they held hands:I remember we went to this club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called the Roxy. And I was watching the band, I was <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> underneath the table, she was holding my hand, and I was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off. It was all I needed. But that means nothing to kids today. She grew up too fast. She wasn't into innocence, and I love that.|$|E
500|$|Responders and paramedics {{from a local}} New Haven fire {{department}} arrived at the hotel, and paramedic Daniel Dolphin stated that a woman met him and his crewmember outside the hotel and escorted them inside. [...] "People were laughing. They were crying. My first impression {{was that it was}} a comedy show and the guy who was lying on the stage was faking it," [...] said Dolphin in a statement to the New Haven Journal-Courier. Dolphin's ambulance partner, Tony Deluise of the New Haven Ambulance Company, said to the Boston Phoenix that he witnessed odd behavior while responding to Slee: [...] "They were all in seats, just <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> facing the stage, like an audience. Most were quiet; a few you could hear crying, a few laughing." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the band}} ended its brief tour {{in support of}} Tweez, most of its members {{attended}} college. Around this time McMahan and Walford began writing together for the band's next record, creating six new songs which the band practiced throughout the summer of 1990. Slint entered River North Records in August 1990 to record Spiderland. At that time there were no vocals or lyrics prepared for the album, so the band wrote them while in the studio. The album's producer, Brian Paulson, {{was known for his}} [...] "live" [...] recording style in the studio, with minimal takes. Paulson recalled [...] "It was weird while I was doing [...] because I remember <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> I just knew there was something about it. I've never heard anything like this. I'm really digging this but it's really fucking weird." ...|$|E
500|$|Swift and Liz Rose wrote [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] during Swift's {{freshman}} year at Hendersonville High School. She conceived the idea {{in the midst of}} her mathematics class: [...] "I was just <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> I started humming this melody." [...] She then related the melody to a predicament she was encountering at the moment. Swift knew that she and her senior boyfriend would break {{up at the end of}} the year when he left for college. In order to cope with the complicated emotions she was experiencing, Swift wrote the song. Rose said Swift showed up at her after school job, writing songs for Sony/ATV Music, [...] "with the idea and the melody, knowing exactly what she wanted." [...] She desired for the song to capture the sweetness and sadness of loving and losing someone. It was written about all the different things that would remind the subject of Swift and their time spent together, once he departed. [...] "To her surprise, the first thing that came to mind was [...] love of Tim McGraw's music." [...] Several personal details were listed for the song. McGraw's mentioning was a reference to Swift's favorite song, [...] "Can't Tell Me Nothin" [...] from his 2004 album Live Like You Were Dying, rather than McGraw as a person. The writing process, as with [...] "Our Song", took place in approximately twenty minutes, and was executed with the use of a piano.|$|E
500|$|Of all the {{elements}} of the series, Zombiepowder.s action sequences received the most feedback. The battle scenes were criticized for their unsophisticated art by Anime News Network, with rough drawings and few backgrounds, though in its second review ANN noted a guiding philosophy to the background omission: elements of the scene which were not props in the fight faded out whenever action began. ANN also said that the action was entertainingly violent, kinetic, well-paced, easy to follow, and interspersed well with comedic moments. They ultimately concluded the action was handled better than average, but with the disclaimer that the action was [...] "the entire sum and substance" [...] of the series. IGN opened their review with a Tite Kubo quote from the first volume's flap: [...] "The theme is fighting. <b>Sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> just reading it without thinking is fine. But if you ever feel like it please try to use your mind as you read," [...] and said that if this advice was taken Zombiepowder. could be a [...] "great shōnen tale", but that without it the story was only enjoyable by dissection and comparison to other series. Gorban's view was again the most positive, stating that the essential trait of a memorable fight scene is to pit two charismatic figures with contrasting personalities and combat styles against each other, and that the series grasped this notion admirably. Finally, Den of Geek found Zombiepowder.s [...] "wall-to-wall" [...] action sequences colorful and fun, but complained that the sheer mass of them overwhelmed the rest of the story.|$|E

[...] Musicians and songwriters she collaborated with during the recording process include Holly Knight, Nina Gordon, Kay Hanley, John 5, Billy Steinberg, Matthew Wilder, Cyndi Lauper, Courtney Love, Joan Jett, and Rancid's Tim Armstrong. Sunday Love was not released at the time, due to Dobson being terminated by Island Records {{just days before the}} album was scheduled for release. The album was reviewed favorably in both Spin and Vibe magazine. [...] "My real good fans, my hardcore fans, have it, so that's most important," [...] Dobson says. [...] "At least it got out there to a few hands, and now it's time to make a record on my own terms." [...] "It was sad," [...] says Dobson.

There's gotta be a next project, and they're <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> there's so many lessons I learned during that movie.
