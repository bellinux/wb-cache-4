5|$|For 15,000 years, {{native peoples}} {{gathered}} at Wyam {{to fish and}} exchange goods. They built wooden platforms {{out over the water}} and caught <b>salmon</b> <b>with</b> dipnets and long spears on poles as the fish swam up through the rapids and jumped over the falls. Historically, an estimated fifteen to twenty million salmon passed through the falls every year, {{making it one of the}} greatest fishing sites in North America.|$|E
5|$|Between 1985 and 2007, only {{an average}} of 18 sockeye salmon {{returned}} to Idaho each year. Serious conservation efforts by wildlife biologists and fish hatcheries have captured the few remaining wild sockeye salmon, collected their sperm and eggs, and in a laboratory, have them spawn. Instead of spawning naturally, these sockeye begin their lives in an incubator in a fishery biologist's laboratory. These baby salmon then are transported by ship, bypassing the dams. (The dams can hurt juvenile baby sockeye <b>salmon</b> <b>with</b> their powerful tides and currents, which suck the baby salmon down.) Another conservation effort that has helped the salmon recover, is the destruction of old, outdated dams, such as the Lewiston Dam on the Clearwater River, {{a tributary of the}} Snake. After destroying the dam, salmon populations noticeably recovered.|$|E

25|$|Salmon {{flesh is}} {{generally}} orange to red, although white-fleshed wild <b>salmon</b> <b>with</b> white-black skin colour occurs. The natural colour of salmon results from carotenoid pigments, largely astaxanthin, but also canthaxanthin, in the flesh. Wild salmon get these carotenoids from eating krill and other tiny shellfish.|$|E

500|$|Salmon populations {{declined}} dramatically {{after the}} establishment of canneries in 1867. In 1879 {{it was reported that}} 545,450 <b>salmon,</b> <b>with</b> an average weight of [...] were caught (in a recent season) and mainly canned for export to England. A can weighing [...] could be sold for 8d or 9d. By 1908, there was widespread concern about the decline of salmon and sturgeon. In that year, the people of Oregon passed two laws under their newly instituted program of citizens' initiatives limiting fishing on the Columbia and other rivers. Then in 1948, another initiative banned the use of seine nets (devices already used by Native Americans, and refined by later settlers) altogether.|$|E
500|$|From its inception, {{the kitchen}} was run mainly by French chefs, {{and it had a}} {{specialist}} in Russian soups and Viennese pastry; its cakes became so famous that King Edward made regular orders from Buckingham Palace. M. Malley, who had been saucier at the Paris Ritz [...] was appointed Chef des Cuisines, and invented dishes such as Saumon Marquise de Sevignre (<b>Salmon</b> <b>with</b> a crayfish mousse), Filet de Sole Romanoff (served with mussels, small slices of apple and artichokes), and Poulet en Chaudfroid (chicken accompanied by a curry-flavoured pinkish mousse) at the hotel. The Ritz is renowned for its supreme catering service, as well as using its fine rooms for conferencing between executives and directors of multi-national firms. A table at the restaurant still needs to be booked weeks in advance. The Rivoli Bar, built in the Art Deco style, was designed in 2001 by interior designer Tessa Kennedy, to look like a bar on the Orient Express. The lounge was decorated by Marcel Boulanger in the Louis VIV style, the clubroom was by Lenygon and Morant, who were influenced by the Palladian design of Cumberland House in Brettingham, and other rooms were decorated with clear William Chambers and Robert Adam influences. Meals can be served on Nanking china in the Trafalgar Suite. The banquet and catering services received a Royal warrant from HRH the Prince of Wales in 2005.|$|E

As at September 2009, all fishing in all locations throughout the province is forbidden during the hours of darkness.|$|E

2500|$|... a tolerance/limit for PCBs in {{commercial}} fish of 2000 ppb A {{follow up study}} confirmed this, and found levels of dioxins, chlorinated pesticides, PCBs and other contaminants up to ten times greater in farmed salmon than wild Pacific salmon. On a positive note, further research using the same fish samples used in the previous study, showed that farmed salmon contained levels of beneficial fatty acids that were {{two to three times}} higher than wild salmon. A follow up benefit-risk analysis on salmon consumption balanced the cancer risks with the (n–3) fatty acid advantages of salmon consumption. It {{is for this reason that}} current methods for this type of analysis take into consideration the lipid content of the sample in question. PCBs specifically are lipophyllic therefore found in higher concentrations in fattier fish in general, thus the higher level of PCB in the farmed fish is in relation to the higher content of beneficial n–3 and n–6 lipids they contain. They found that recommended levels of (n–3) fatty acid consumption can be achieved eating farmed <b>salmon</b> <b>with</b> acceptable carcinogenic risks, but recommended levels of EPA+DHA intake cannot be achieved solely from farmed (or wild) salmon without unacceptable carcinogenic risks. The conclusions of this paper from 2005 were that ...|$|E
