40|$|International audienceHydro-geochemical {{analysis}} was performed to investigate the interplay between the groundwater, host rock and water <b>curtain</b> <b>system</b> for the start-up of a pilot underground oil storage facility in China. 54 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed to obtain {{the characteristics of the}} hydro-geochemical environment evolution for the start-up period. The groundwater-rock mass interaction was studied with comparing the changes in the ion concentrations, pH values and total dissolved solid concentrations in the groundwater and a mineralogical analysis of the host rock. The groundwater-water <b>curtain</b> <b>system</b> interaction was identified using statistical analysis of the similarity in chemical contents in the groundwater samples. A mixing calculation was performed to evaluate the mixing ratios of the water <b>curtain</b> <b>system,</b> background water and oil/vapor in the seepage water into the storage caverns. It was concluded that calcium carbonate equilibrium is the predominant chemical reaction. The 54 groundwater samples could be classified into 5 clusters. Among the 5 clusters, there is one cluster showing that the tap water injected to the water <b>curtain</b> <b>system</b> is similar in chemical contents to those in the monitoring boreholes around the facility, which confirms the efficiency of the water <b>curtain</b> <b>system</b> for the start-up of the facility. It was found that the two dominant factors influencing the evolution of groundwater chemical content were host rock dissolution and groundwater seepage. Most of seepage water was originated from oil/vapor and water <b>curtain</b> <b>system</b> while the percentage from the background water was almost zero in the start-up period of the facility. © 2017 Elsevier Lt...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{underground}} water-sealed storage {{technique is}} critically important and generally accepted for the national energy strategy in China. Although several small underground water-sealed oil storage caverns have been built in China since the 1970 s, {{there is still a}} lack of experience for large-volume underground storage in complicated geological conditions. The current design concept of water <b>curtain</b> <b>system</b> and the technical instruction for system operation have limitations in maintaining the stability of surrounding rock mass during the construction of the main storage caverns, as well as the long-term stability. Although several large-scale underground oil storage projects are under construction at present in China, the design concepts and construction methods, especially for the water <b>curtain</b> <b>system,</b> are mainly based on the ideal porosity medium flow theory and the experiences gained from the similar projects overseas. The storage projects currently constructed in China have the specific features such as huge scale, large depth, multiple-level arrangement, high seepage pressure, complicated geological conditions, and high in situ stresses, which are the challenging issues for the stability of the storage caverns. Based on years' experiences obtained from the first large-scale (millions of cubic meters) underground water-sealed oil storage project in China, some design and operation problems related to water <b>curtain</b> <b>system</b> during project construction are discussed. The drawbacks and merits of the water <b>curtain</b> <b>system</b> are also presented. As an example, the conventional concept of “filling joints with water” is widely used in many cases, as a basic concept for the design of the water <b>curtain</b> <b>system,</b> but it is immature. In this paper, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the conventional concept are pointed out, with respect to the long-term stability as well as the safety of construction of storage caverns. Finally, new concepts and principles for design and construction of the underground water-sealed oil storage caverns are proposed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe <b>curtain</b> wall <b>system</b> {{is widely}} used in {{high-rise}} buildings because of its many advantages. With the increasing demands for building energy efficiency, thermal performance has become an important consideration in developing <b>curtain</b> wall <b>systems.</b> Even though the relative impact of the edge effect becomes more important as the thermal performance of glazing and the frame increases, the percentages of the frame out of the total curtain wall area have not been considered in evaluating its thermal transmittance. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to evaluate the effect of the frame ratio on the thermal transmittance of the <b>curtain</b> wall <b>system.</b> The state of the curtain wall frame ratio is analyzed by investigating recently constructed office buildings. Eight cases of different frame ratios and three types of glazing U-values are selected, and the total thermal transmittance of the curtain wall (Ucw) for each case was calculated by using TRISCO 12. 0 W. This study found that when the higher frame ratio is applied to the <b>curtain</b> wall <b>system,</b> the thermal transmittance of curtain wall is higher. Furthermore, the frame ratio has greater effect on the thermal transmittance of curtain wall when high performance glazing is applied to the <b>curtain</b> wall <b>system.</b> It is recommended that the certificates of a <b>curtain</b> wall <b>system</b> should show the frame ratio that was applied during testing or the accurate Ucw value considering actual frame ratio should be submitted for more reasonable building energy simulation...|$|R

The insulating glass unit is clamped to the mullion between two gaskets, functioning as a rain screen and airtightness layer.

H 577 P BSE 2015 Lauxix, 157 leaves, 97 {{variously}} numbered pages :illustrations (some color); 30 cmLocal code {{of practice}} for fire safety in buildings issued by Buildings Department (BD) requires supertall buildings over forty storeys high to provide a refuge floor for every 25 storeys in residential/commercial buildings. However, the protection to external wall openings on refuge floor by a drencher/water <b>curtain</b> <b>system</b> falls within {{the jurisdiction of the}} Fire Services Department (FSD). There is a concern on the trend for flatted units in supertall buildings to have large window/glass panes design so as to have more sunlight and a better view. The result is that this design increases the impact of the ventilation factor, which in turn steps up the heat release rate for flashover and fire development in compartment fires. Another concern is the external wall opening sizes on the refuge floor vary greatly in different types of buildings. The differeence in the ratio of the area of an external wall opening to the area of the external wall of the refuge floor greatly affects the effectiveness of cross-ventilation on that floor. For a better understanding, a survey of building plans including 44 building lots (51 blocks) of residential and non-residential buildings was conducted. As statistics from FSD reveal that about 80 % of structural fires occurred in government housing estates and private residential buildings, my study focuses on these types of buildings. Detailed inspections of building plans of 29 building lots (31 blocks) were conducted to obtain and analyze, for each of the building, the ratio of the area of an external wall opening to the area of the external wall on the refuge floor, the ratio of the window opening area to the external wall area as well as the ratio of the window opening area to the floor area of the flatted unit immediately below the refuge floor. The trend of refuge floor designs and the cross-ventilation requirement stipulated in the relevant local building code were also analysed. To determine the minimum amount of heat released for flashover in a compartment with large window panes, 31 supertall residential buildings were selected and the Babrauskas method for flashover was adopted. The results showed that the average minimum heat release rate for flashover was 15. 3 MW for an unit having an average window opening area of 15. 1 m². To evaluate the effectiveness of a water <b>curtain</b> <b>system</b> in achieving heat reduction, radiation attenuation and smoke reduction from entering the refuge floor, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) was adopted. Before working on the CFD model, a pre-study in four main subject areas was conducted: (1) comparing the simulation results of the FDS model with another CFD model called "SIMTEC" and also with the results of full-scale burning test from literature; (2) selecting appropriate fuel types as an input parameter in FDS simulation; (3) comparing the performance of the sprinkler system and the water curtain system; and (4) making FDS trial runs covering different locations of fire seat, domain model geometry and fire sizes, etc. Simulation results from my pre-study showed that the results generated by the FDS model were comparatively more conservative in subject area 1 (i. e. lower temperture reduction and lower radiation attenuation) and agreed well with burning test results from literature (at least in the veocity of outflow gases) and with temeprature profile of the fire plume. In the selection of the appropriate fuel type for FDS simulation study, my prime objective was to look for the adverse effects in the combustion of propane, wood, polyurethane (PU) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Simulation results including outputs of temperature, visibilities, carbon monoxide concentrations and radiation heat fluxes from different scenarios were evaluated. The highly hazardous properties of burning PVC and PU in producing large amounts of carbon monoxide and very low visibilities within {{a short period of time}} were carefully considered. The sprinkler system is commonly used in fire protection but this is not the case in the protection of external wall openings on the refuge floor. To compare the performance of the sprinkler system with that of the water <b>curtain</b> <b>system</b> in defined scenarios, the FDS model was adopted. Simulation results showed that the water <b>curtain</b> <b>system</b> performed better in of temeprature reduction and radiation atttenuation. To simulate the performance of the water <b>curtain</b> <b>system</b> on refuge floor external wall openings, a two-storey building model consisting of a fire room measuring 11 m (length) x 9 m (width) x 3 m (height) on the ground floor with a refuge floor immediately above it was designed. A fire was assumed to be spreading from the fire room after a flashover fire with flames ejecting through broken windows and spreading upwards along the external wall and wall openings of the refuge floor. An in-depth simulation study using FDS in different scenarios and design parameters including different fire sizes, opening widths of the fire room, wind speeds and scenarios with and without the water <b>curtain</b> <b>system</b> were conducted. The results showed that the water curtain sytem performed well in temeperature reduction, radiation attenuation and visibility enhancement on the refuge floor. Attenuation of thermal radiation by the drencher/water <b>curtain</b> <b>system</b> and relevant parameters such as water flow rates, water pressures, spacing of drencher nozzles, water droplet sizes and water density were studied using FDS simulation. Theories of Beer-Lambert's law and its analogy were adopted and simulation data analysed. The relationship between the parameters and the ratios of radiation intensity for scenarios with and without water curtain protection was established. A generalized equation to calculate the maximum attenuation of thermal radiation by a water <b>curtain</b> <b>system</b> was formulated using multiple regression analysis. The introduction of a building fire safety management system to monitor building fire safety based on the total fire safety concept together with an ultimate building fire safety audit system to ensure overall building fire safety has been developed. Methods and procedures in the evaluation of building fire safety levels are also presented. The thesis concludes that in the scenarios studied, the water <b>curtain</b> <b>system</b> performs well in temperature reduction, radiation attenuation and visibility enhancement on the refuge floor; and offers recommendations on how to improve the design of the water <b>curtain</b> <b>system.</b> Limitations of the study and suggestions on further work on the adequacy of ventilation requirement on the refuge floor are also given.

This was conducted when the three 108 m long, 2. 4 m diameter cast in steel shell piles driven in 2000 {{as part of the}} PIDP, were restruck in December of 2002. During the measurements, the bubble <b>curtain</b> <b>system</b> was turned ON and OFF. The restrike involved driving the piles at refusal with the hammer at maximum energy (1, 600 to 1, 740 kilojoules). This condition is not anticipated during the east span SFOBB new east span construction. The reduction in sound pressures provided by the bubble <b>curtain</b> <b>system</b> ranged considerably. The direct reduction in sound pressures, which is evaluated by comparing bubble curtain ON and OFF measurements, for Piles 1 and 2 was 6 to 17 dB for peak pressures and 3 to 10 dB for RMS sound pressure levels. Piles 1 and 2 were located next to each other. Reductions at Pile 3, which was in shallower water, were over 20 dB for both peak pressures and RMS sound pressure levels on the north side. However, the reductions on the south side for Pile 3 were much less. Close to Pile 3 on the south side, the reductions were on the order of 5 to 7 dB. Further away at about 450 m south, the reductions were only about 2 dB. Uneven bottom topography around Pile 3, which could have compromised the bubble curtain performance near the bay bottom, is suspected to have resulted in the lower reductions to the south. It {{is important to note that}} overall sound pressures associated with Pile 3 were lower than those with Piles 1 and 2.
