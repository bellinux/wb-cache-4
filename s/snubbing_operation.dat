40|$|Master's thesis in Risk managementDuring well {{drilling}} operation, {{there is a}} possibility of a kick (influx). When a kick is not controlled properly it will become a blow out. This is an uncontrolled and sudden flow of formation fluid that releases from a reservoir through a well bore into surface as a result of pressure difference in formation and well. The kick could flow to surface and create explosions causing fatality, environment damage and loss of asset resulting in high cost. There are procedures and methods to deal with the occurrence of kicks and blowouts in order to control a well flow. Moreover, well barriers should be established and designed based on the characteristics of the reservoir and rock formation. The last line of protection in well barriers is known as Blowout Preventer (BOP). It {{is one of the most}} important barriers to prevent unintentional hydrocarbon release when all well barriers in a well have failed. There are many factors that influence the performance of a BOP. The purpose of this thesis is to determine the criticality of components in BOP related to the redundancies they have during well shut in, stripping, snubbing and BOP testing operation. By knowing the criticality of BOP components, we can assure which components that should be focused on for maintenance and testing. It will also indicate which components that gives redundancy to the BOP during well shut in, stripping, snubbing and BOP testing operation, if one or more components are failed. A literature study is the main work of this thesis. Studying the principal, functions, operations and factors related to drilling activity with respect to the use of BOP. In addition, relevant regulations and standards are also describes to specify the required specification of BOP. The analysis of criticality is done by using risk tools such as reliability block diagram, FMECA, criticality matrix, redundancy and effect table. All of these risk tools complement each other to give the final conclusion of critical component in a BOP. The result of the analysis shows five critical components in a BOP with the prioritization start from shuttle valve (blind shear ram function), blind shear ram (ram piston), flange (BOP stack), gasket (BOP stack) and annular preventer (rubber housing) respectively. In the event of kick and well shut in is initiated, the above critical component is very critical to the safety of personnel. Stripping and <b>snubbing</b> <b>operation</b> also require the critical components to be function properly, but with less critical when well shut in has been done earlier. During BOP testing operation, the critical components might not be critical if it fail as there are many safety measure and procedure for safety...|$|E

40|$|Rack and pinion {{technology}} {{has been with us}} in various applications for decades. The method is well known for long durability and high efficiency. Experience on using rack and pinion technology in the drilling industry dates back to the mid 80 ’s, when it was used mainly for pipe handling equipment and other relatively slow moving machines. With the forming of Engineering and Drilling Machinery (EDM) in 1997, significant advances and refinements to the technology contributed to several patent applications which later have been granted internationally. During the late 90 ’s EDM was engaged in several projects in-volving equipment for workover and <b>snubbing</b> <b>operations</b> in the North Sea area. At that time such operations were dangerous to people and surroundings, often consisting of suit-able or not so suitable equipment stacked {{on top of each other}} without a consistent design and consideration to HSE and optimal functionality. To improve the situation, EDM de-signed [9], a workover machine utilizing rack and pinion technology allowing faster and simpler rig up and rig down, lower weight and higher safety level. The main value, how-ever, was that the rig could easily shift from drilling, workover into <b>snubbing</b> and underbalanced <b>operations,</b> without modifications to the rig, such as use of temporary wires...|$|R
5000|$|All uniform tilings can be {{constructed}} from various operations applied to regular tilings. These operations as named by Norman Johnson are called truncation (cutting vertices), rectification (cutting vertices until edges disappear), and Cantellation (cutting edges). Omnitruncation is an operation that combines truncation and cantellation. <b>Snubbing</b> is an <b>operation</b> of Alternate truncation of the omnitruncated form. (See Uniform polyhedron#Wythoff construction operators for more details.) ...|$|R
40|$|In rig constructions two nev designs {{have been}} {{introduced}} apart from the conventional hoisting system. The first one is the Maritime Hydraulics A. S RamRig© drilling concept, based on hydraulic cylinders as actuators powered by up to 3. 4 MW of hydraulic power in a closed loop hydraulic system. This synthesis of the well-known technology allows {{for the use of}} integrated active and passive heave compensation, as well as the storing and reuse of energy from the lowering phase of an operation. The RamRig concept makes mechanical brakes and clutches obsolete, since hoisting and lowering of the load is controlled solely by the closed loop hydraulics. This decreases the number of critical mechanical components in the hoisting system to a minimum. Safe handling and emergency shut down of extreme amounts of hydraulic power is taking care of by cartridge valves, which make rerouting of hydraulic power possible with minor losses of transferred effect. The second is a new land rig concept based on a patented rack & pinion drive system with a new generation of rigs which can instantly switch between the workover, drilling and the <b>snubbing</b> <b>operations.</b> The new rig concept has a direct drive, thus no drill line. The mobilization time is reduced as the rig has fewer truck loads, a faster rig up and a higher automation level. One land rig currently under construction will be the world’s first single operator unit, with a full pipe handling capability and a fully automated control system. The rig is fully equipped with the 250 T top drive which can be used for the rotation and snubbing, the purpose designed snubbing slips and other features supporting the multifunctional well operations. The paper will focus on features related to the land rig under construction, and how it may reduce the operational cost and improve the well performance...|$|R
50|$|In geometry, a <b>snub</b> is an <b>operation</b> {{applied to}} a polyhedron. The term {{originates}} from Kepler's names of two Archimedean solids, for the snub cube (cubus simus) and snub dodecahedron (dodecaedron simum). In general, snubs have chiral symmetry with two forms, with clockwise or counterclockwise orientations. By Kepler's names, a snub {{can be seen as}} an expansion of a regular polyhedron, with the faces moved apart, and twists on their centers, adding new polygons centered on the original vertices, and pairs of triangles fitting between the original edges.|$|R
50|$|Snubbing {{is a type}} {{of heavy}} well {{intervention}} performed on oil and gas wells. It involves running the BHA on a pipe string using a hydraulic workover rig. Unlike wireline or coiled tubing, the pipe is not spooled off a drum but made up and broken up while running in and pulling out, much like conventional drill pipe. Due to the large rigup, it is only used for the most demanding of operations when lighter intervention techniques do not offer the strength and durability. Unlike conventional drilling and completions <b>operations,</b> <b>snubbing</b> can be performed with the well still under pressure (not killed). When done so, it is called hydraulic workover. It can also be performed without having to remove the Christmas tree from the wellhead.|$|R
