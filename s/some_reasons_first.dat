The novelty of the analysis is determined by the fact that the author refers to the ways of expression of the distributivity and frequency of the verbal action in the cognitive aspect. Moreover, the distributive way of action, though stands out from the range of aspect meanings, yet makes such a link of common aspectology, which has not yet been studied in full volume for <b>some</b> <b>reasons.</b> <b>First</b> of all it may be referred to the French and the Ossetian languages. According to the analysis, the author comes to the following conclusions. French, Russian and Ossetian linguistic systems unite by the signs of integration in the expressing of the studied ways of action. Thus, in all the three compared languages the grammatical markers of the same semantic significance often take part in the creation of meaning of frequency. The distributive way of action occurs at a multiplicity of objects or subjects. However, to express the frequency, the French language often uses morphologically characterized way of action, which neither Russian nor Ossetian languages have in this situation, in spite of their inflectional systems.

However, this kind of help from the teacher is sometimes undesirable due to <b>some</b> <b>reasons.</b> <b>First,</b> it makes the students more interested in knowing their marks than the errors they got. Second, it has been argued {{a long time ago that}} the teachers should not use pen in correcting. Seeing a composition with a bunch red pen-markings is discouraging, because the students see only the number of errors they have made. It makes them lose their confidence and feel their self-esteem slapped. Third, written feedback is often too brief and/or unclear. Fourth, written feedback provides no suggestions and at times the teachers handwriting is difficult to read. Fifth, both teacher and students have difficulty to find a time slot when they are free to attend in a writing conference. Sixth, there is also no good communication between the teacher and students in order to solve some problems in writing that they have faced, especially for a student who is afraid to ask questions when he/ she doesn’t understand. To know whether Audiotaped Feedback (ATF) is effective enough to improve students’ grammatical performance and idea in writing, the writer conducts this study using qualitative action research that consist of planning, acting, observing, reflecting and suggesting for the next planning.

That result can be seen that the number of the students’ errors in the final draft for each assignment has reduced. Besides, ATF also helps students in making reasonable corrections in his or her mistakes and in describing a thing with a good organization, a better grammar, a good idea and a detailed information, because it gives an opportunity for the teacher to give clearer and more explanation about how a composition can be improved...|$|E

The objectives of the study are, (1) to describe the implementation of text twist game through cooperative learning to improve students’ mastery of English noun, and (2) to find out the improvement of students’ mastery of English noun after taught using text-twist game. Those problems were analyzed through a classroom action research at the seven grade of MTs Negeri Model Babakan Lebaksiu Tegal in academic year of 2015 / 2016.

40|$|Language is a {{universal}} human activity. People use language {{in order to be}} able to communicate with one another in everyday life. Therefore, language is said to be a means of communication in the society. People may speak different languages to express their ideas depending on the contents in which they are involved. Since people may speak many languages differently in different social context, we need to understand the pattern of communication. One way to understand the pattern of communication is by analyzing speech acts. In this thesis the writer discusses speech acts in literary work and the literary work which is discussed here is a play. The writer chooses a play because she has <b>some</b> <b>reasons.</b> <b>First,</b> in reading a play, the writer has to be a creative reader to understand the dialogue between the characters. By being creative, she will be able to dig up the content of the play to get as much information as she can. The second, it is not enough to read a play as simply as sequence of statement made by newspaper in the hot-line or statement in the cover of magazines. The reader has to imagine what the dialogue between the characters look like on the stage. The play which is being discussed here is Ile. Ile is considered by some critics as one of the most powerful tragedies yet written in the one-act form. This one-act play was about the journey of Captain Keeney, his wife, and his crew in searching for whale's oil. During his journey, some conflicts happened and at the end of the story the captain's wife lost her mind. Although Ile is only one-act play, it has all elements of a drama and it is well-performed and became O'Neill's first successful play. The author, Eugene O'Neill is known as one of the American greatest playwrights who takes care much about human problems. Based on the above reasons, the writer wants to analyze Eugene O'Neill successful play 'Ile' in order to find out the speech act elements which are used there. As we know, speech acts can be categorized into three parts, they are locutionary acts, illocutionary acts, and perlocutionary acts. Here, the writer wants to find out the three elements above in 'Ile'. To make this study easier, the writer divided the play into three parts: dialogues between minor characters, dialogues between minor and main characters, and dialogues between main characters. The writer applied the elements into each dialogue. Locutionary acts is known as the physical acts of producing an utterance or the acts themselves and in De it is appeared in every dialogue. Illocutionary acts is the acts which are comrnited by producing the utterance and can be divided into severaltypes. Here, the writer used classification of illocutionary acts by Elizabeth C. Traugott and Mary Louis Pratt. There are seven types of illocutionary acts, they are representative, expressive, verdictive, directive, commisive, declarative, and phatic function. All types of illocutionary acts occur in Ile. Representative mostly occured in the dialogue between minor and main characters (69. 88...|$|E

The conclusions focus on patterns of strategic change and on contrasting characteristics of entrepreneurship and planning. Little research has been undertaken on how strategies actually form in orga-nizations, for <b>some</b> obvious <b>reasons.</b> <b>First,</b> strategies do not change on sched-ule; they may remain stable for years, even decades, before changing. Second, {{even when they do}} change, the process can be complex. Both of these char-acteristics call for intensive, longitudinal research, which means small sample sizes and large investments of time. Researchers in management generally have hesitated to undertake such research. More important, perhaps, research has been discouraged by the very way in which the concept of strategy has been conceived. In the literature, strategy always has been defined in terms of intentions, guidelines for the future-essentially in terms of plans. Chandler’s definition is typical: “the determina-tion of the basic long-term goals and objectives of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and the allocation of resources necessary for carrying out these goals ” (1962, p. 13). But conceiving strategy in terms of intentions means restricting research to the study of perceptions of what those who, it is believed, make strategy intend to do. And that kind of research-of intentions devoid of behavior-simply is not very interesting or productive.
