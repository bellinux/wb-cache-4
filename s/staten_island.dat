5|$|Elected {{officials}} on <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> such as Diane Savino have been demanding {{the replacement of}} the <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> Railway's aging R44 train cars. Initially, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority planned to order R179s for the <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> Railway, but later decided to overhaul some R46s to replace the existing R44s there. However, the plan to overhaul the R46s for the <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> Railway was also dropped, and 75 future R211S cars are planned to replace the <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> Railway's fleet of R44s instead. Until then, the R44s are undergoing another round of scheduled maintenance to extend their usefulness until at least 2023.|$|E
5|$|On June 1, 2005, the <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> Rapid Transit Police Department was disbanded and the 25 <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> {{railroad}} Police Officers {{merged into}} {{the much larger}} Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police department was created in 1998 when the Long Island Rail Road Police and the Metro-North Railroad Police Departments merged. In 2005 the MTA Police Department then opened their newest patrol district, Police District #9 which began covering the <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> Railway.|$|E

5|$|Subway {{service would}} be {{provided}} to <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> for the first time, {{with the construction of}} a tunnel under the Narrows connecting at 68th Street to the BMT Fourth Avenue Line and with the <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> Railway at New Brighton and Tompkinsville.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> Tunnel is an abandoned, {{incomplete}} railway/subway tunnel in New York City. It {{was intended}} to connect railways on <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> (precursors to the modern-day <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> Railway) to the BMT Fourth Avenue Line of the New York City Subway, in Brooklyn, via a new crossing under the Narrows. Planned to extend , the tunnel would {{have been among the}} world's longest {{at the time of its}} planning, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
5|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony was}} held by New York City Mayor John Hylan on April 14, 1923 in Bay Ridge and in <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> on July 19. Headings were dug and tunneling shafts were sunk at 68th Street and Shore Road in Brooklyn (the Shore Road Shaft), and underneath the Saint George Terminal in <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> (the South Street Shaft), costing a total of $1 million. In addition, {{in preparation for the}} tunnel, the SIRT purchased one hundred ME-1 subway cars built to BMT specifications and electrified its three-passenger branches. The impending completion of the tunnel also sparked real estate interests in <b>Staten</b> <b>Island.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Richmond Turnpike Company {{started a}} {{steamboat}} service from Manhattan to <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> in 1817. Cornelius Vanderbilt bought {{the company in}} 1838, and it was sold to the <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> Railroad Company in 1864. The <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> Ferry was then sold to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1884, and the City of New York assumed control of the ferry in 1905. The ferry, which still operates, was {{at one point the}} only commuter ferry within the entire city, after the discontinuation of the Hoboken ferry in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Under the new plan, freight {{would still}} only operate at night through the tunnel. Spurs {{connecting}} the tunnel in Brooklyn to the Long Island freight belt line, to the B freight sidings on <b>Staten</b> <b>Island,</b> {{and to the}} new city piers on <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> would have all been built. The project was projected to cost $60,000,000 and if the job was done quickly, {{it could have been}} done by 1929. The route would help develop the waterfront areas in <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> and Jamaica Bay. Provisions would be made for connections with the subway system's Fourth Avenue Line, even though the Transit Commission refused to be involved with the plans.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, plans for reopening the <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> Rapid Transit line in New Jersey were {{announced}} by the New York Port Authority. Since the Central Railroad of New Jersey became a New Jersey Transit line, a new junction would be built to the former Lehigh Valley Railroad. In order for all New England and southern freight {{to pass through the}} New York metropolitan area, a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to <b>Staten</b> <b>Island,</b> and a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Greenville, New Jersey were planned. On December 15, 2004, a $72 million project to reactivate freight service on <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> and to repair the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge was {{announced by the}} NYCEDC and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Specific projects on the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge included repainting the steel superstructure and rehabilitating the lift mechanism. In June 2006, the freight line connection from New Jersey to the <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> Railway was completed, and became operated in part by the Morristown and Erie Railway under contract with the State of New Jersey and other companies.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade and Douglas studied four {{options for}} a tunnel from Brooklyn to New Jersey, some {{involving}} a tunnel to <b>Staten</b> <b>Island.</b> These included {{an option for}} a tunnel directly from Greenville Yard to the Bay Ridge Branch, and a link from New Jersey to Manhattan. Also under consideration was a single-tube tunnel with accommodations for electric units only. The Greenville–Brooklyn tunnel would be about $331 million, which was cheaper than the approximately $405 million tunnel from <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> to Brooklyn.|$|E

50|$|The {{neighborhood}} was also drastically transformed {{with the opening}} of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in November 1964. Soon after this, the farms were sold and broken up, and residential housing was built on the property. Many of the owners of the newly built homes were Jewish families, and as a result, Willowbrook became the center of the island's Orthodox Jewish community, which from the turn of the 20th century until the late 1960s and early 1970s was primarily centered in <b>Staten</b> <b>Island's</b> North Shore neighborhood of Tompkinsville along with most of <b>Staten</b> <b>Island's</b> then-small Jewish population.|$|R

The opening of the viaduct marked the final part of a $6,000,000 grade crossing elimination project on <b>Staten</b> <b>Island,</b> which eliminated thirty-four grade crossings on the north and south shores of <b>Staten</b> <b>Island.</b>|$|E
5|$|On June 28, Washington {{learned that}} the British fleet had set sail from Halifax on June 9 and were heading toward New York.

Within a few hours, 45 British ships dropped anchor in Lower New York Bay. Less than a week later, there were 130 ships off <b>Staten</b> <b>Island</b> {{under the command of}} Richard Howe, the brother of the general. The population of New York went into panic {{at the sight of the}} British ships; alarms went off and troops immediately rushed to their posts. On July 2, British troops began to land on <b>Staten</b> <b>Island.</b> The continental regulars on the island took a few shots at them before fleeing, and the citizens' militia switched over to the British side.|$|E
