5|$|Dandelion: A buck rabbit {{notable for}} his <b>storytelling</b> ability and speed. He is {{instrumental}} in luring the Nuthanger Farm dog into the Efrafans {{during the siege}} of Watership Down.|$|E
5|$|<b>Storytelling</b> is {{an ancient}} custom in Somali culture. Love of cinema in Somalia is but a modern, visual {{incarnation}} and continuation of this well-established oral tradition.|$|E
5|$|The Mersea Island Food, Drink & Leisure Festival {{takes place}} in May in the Mersea Vineyard. It {{combines}} a food theatre showing various meals, particularly oysters, with local live music and <b>storytelling.</b>|$|E
5|$|The central trio of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy from Star Trek: The Original Series {{was modeled}} on {{classical}} mythological <b>storytelling.</b>|$|E
5|$|The initial {{selling point}} of Front Mission was its <b>storytelling</b> approach. Taking {{place during the}} 21st and 22nd centuries, the series {{revolves}} around military conflicts and political tension between powerful supranational unions and their member states. Although the Front Mission video games use self-contained, standalone stories, these tie into a greater overarching storyline that encompasses the entire series. In combination with the stories from its other media, the series possesses a level of <b>storytelling</b> depth and continuity comparable to a serial drama.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its {{historic}} range, the California condor {{has been a}} popular subject of mythology and an important symbol to Native Americans. Unusually, this bird takes on different roles in the <b>storytelling</b> of the different tribes.|$|E
5|$|While known {{within the}} fandom for his spoken <b>storytelling,</b> Conway {{is also the}} author of several short stories {{published}} in various works by Sofawolf Press.|$|E
5|$|While {{technology}} increases {{demand for}} entertainment products and offers increased speed of delivery, the forms {{that make up}} the content are in themselves, relatively stable. <b>Storytelling,</b> music, theatre, dance and games are recognisably the same as in earlier centuries.|$|E
5|$|Critics have {{positively}} {{received some}} of the stories within the collection, analyzing Anarky as a unique force for political commentary and discussion within DC Comics' <b>storytelling.</b> However, the expansive growth of the character's unique abilities and characterization has also fueled criticism as having overpowered the character beyond suspension of disbelief.|$|E
5|$|Daft Punk {{are noted}} {{for their use}} of visual {{components}} associated with their musical productions. The music videos for their singles from Homework featured distinctive characters and placed emphasis on <b>storytelling</b> instead of musical performance. The album Discovery subsequently became the soundtrack to Interstella 5555.|$|E
5|$|Deep Space Nine stands {{apart from}} earlier Trek series for its lengthy {{serialized}} <b>storytelling,</b> conflict within the crew, and religious themes—all elements that critics and audiences praised but Roddenberry forbade {{in the original}} series and The Next Generation. Nevertheless, he was informed before his death of DS9, making this the last Star Trek series connected to Gene Roddenberry.|$|E
5|$|Dominica's folk musical {{heritage}} includes work songs, <b>storytelling,</b> children's {{music and}} masquerade songs. Dominican work songs {{are accompanied by}} the tambou twavay drum, and are performed by workers while gathering fruit, building roads, fishing, moving a house or sawing wood. Many are responsorial, and are generally short and simple, with the lyrical text and rhythm tying into the work to be accompanied. On modern Dominica, work songs are rarely performed.|$|E
5|$|Edward Bloom (Finney), {{a former}} {{traveling}} salesman in the Southern United States {{with a gift}} for <b>storytelling,</b> is now confined to his deathbed. Will (Crudup), his estranged son, attempts to mend their relationship as Bloom relates tall tales of his eventful life as a young adult (portrayed by Ewan McGregor in the flashback scenes).|$|E
5|$|Folk-stories told in {{the nineteenth}} century about elves are still told in modern Denmark and Sweden, but now feature ethnic {{minorities}} in place of elves in an essentially racist discourse. In an ethnically fairly homogeneous medieval countryside, supernatural beings provided the Other through which everyday people created their identities; in cosmopolitan industrial contexts, ethnic minorities or immigrants are used in <b>storytelling</b> to similar effect.|$|E
5|$|In {{late fall}} and early winter, the mansion is host to several {{theatrical}} performances. From {{the end of}} October to mid-November, Poe Evermore, a <b>storytelling</b> event based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe is held. Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, Victorian Christmas or A Dickens of a Christmas, the telling {{of the story of}} A Christmas Carol, is performed.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} Francophone musics of the Lesser Antilles, Dominican folk {{music is a}} hybrid of African and European elements. The quadrille is an {{important}} symbol of French Antillean culture, and is, on Dominica, typically accompanied {{by a kind of}} ensemble called a jing ping band. In addition, Dominica's folk tradition includes folk songs called bélé, traditional <b>storytelling</b> called kont, masquerade, children's and work songs, and Carnival music.|$|E
5|$|Mass Effect 2 (PC, PS3, Xbox 360) by BioWare, {{the most}} {{acclaimed}} {{game of the}} Mass Effect series, set a new standard for expansive yet cohesive <b>storytelling</b> and character development. It {{remains one of the}} best reviewed games of the generation (96% on Metacritic for the 360 version) and won numerous awards including the BAFTA and AIAS Game of the Year awards.|$|E
5|$|Music {{and dance}} are an {{integral}} part of Cameroonian ceremonies, festivals, social gatherings, and <b>storytelling.</b> Traditional dances are highly choreographed and separate men and women or forbid participation by one sex altogether. The goals of dances range from pure entertainment to religious devotion. Traditionally, music is transmitted orally. In a typical performance, a chorus of singers echoes a soloist.|$|E
5|$|Music is a {{supporting}} component of {{many kinds of}} entertainment and most kinds of performance. For example, {{it is used to}} enhance <b>storytelling,</b> it is indispensable in dance (1, 4) and opera, and is usually incorporated into dramatic film or theatre productions.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Remedy planned Bright Falls as a free-roaming, sandbox-style open world city, {{similar to}} those seen in the Grand Theft Auto series. After trying this idea for six months, the team decided to scrap it, because it {{interfered}} with the pacing and <b>storytelling</b> they intended to deliver in a thriller game.|$|E
5|$|Pierre Henri Cami's {{character}} Baron de Crac, a French {{soldier and}} courtier under Louis XV, is {{an imitation of}} the Baron Munchausen stories. In 1998, the British game designer James Wallis used the Baron character to create a multi-player <b>storytelling</b> game, The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen, in which players improvise Munchausen-like first-person stories while overcoming objections and other interruptions from opponents.|$|E
5|$|Rakeysh Mehra took {{seven years}} to {{research}} and develop the story, including three to write the script. While some raised doubts about his morale following the failure of his last film, Aks, at the box office, he retorted by saying {{that it would not}} affect him at all. He added that not only did his <b>storytelling</b> technique improve, but past mistakes had helped him improve his filmmaking abilities.|$|E
5|$|Reviews for {{the episode}} were {{relatively}} positive. Many critics {{saw it as}} a step-up in quality from the first season and praised the darker approach to <b>storytelling.</b> In the United States, the two-hour season premiere achieved a viewership of 4.46 million. The episode garnered a Nielsen rating of 1.5 in the 18–49 demographic, down from the season finale.|$|E
5|$|The Theatre of Small Convenience {{entered the}} Guinness Book of World Records in 2002 as the {{smallest}} theatre in the world. Located {{in a former}} Victorian public convenience in {{the centre of the}} town in Edith Walk in, the theatre has a capacity of 12 people. The theatre regularly hosts puppetry, professional and amateur actors, drama, poetry, <b>storytelling</b> and opera, and has become a regular venue of the Malvern Fringe Festival.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} was {{produced}} by the ABC Studios in association with The Mark Gordon Company and Random Acts Productions. Safran, Gordon, Robert Sertner, Nicholas Pepper and Jake Coburn served as the executive producers. The show was designed to have a flashback narrative, shifting between two timelines. Safran incorporated the flashforward <b>storytelling</b> technique as he thought it allowed them to spread out the plot points.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{tribes of}} Sarawak traditionally used oratory {{to pass on}} their culture {{from one generation to}} the next; examples of these traditional practices include the Iban's Ngajat dances, Renong (Iban vocal repertory), Ensera (Iban oral narratives), and epic <b>storytelling</b> by the Kayan and Kenyah.|$|E
5|$|The kont, or <b>storytelling,</b> folk {{tradition}} of Dominica was focused around entertainment for night-time festivals, funeral wakes and feasts and festivals. Modern kont is mostly performed during major festival competitions. Most kont storytellers work with local traditions, such as legends and history, {{and provide an}} ethical or moral message. A one line theme song, often based around a duet between two characters, recurs throughout most kont performances.|$|E
5|$|The <b>storytelling</b> {{tends to}} be melodramatic, and the stories {{tend to focus on}} struggles against social oppression in which {{characters}} are silenced by economic, political, and other social forces. The characters are clearly delineated as good or evil—the good drawn sympathetically and the evil with the contempt of the artist's moral indignation.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} {{emphasized}} gameplay for the player to learn without tutorial and <b>storytelling</b> {{that did not}} interrupt the play experience. Compared to the previous game, the developers wanted Lara Croft Go puzzles to have fewer elements and be completely visible without scrolling, such that the player could see puzzles in their entirety and focus instead on solving for the correct sequence. The camera also follows Croft rather than remaining stationary.|$|E
5|$|Turfing, {{an acronym}} for Taking Up Room on the Floor, was created in 2002 by Jeriel Bey in Oakland, California. Turfing is a fusion of miming and gliding that places heavy {{emphasis}} on <b>storytelling</b> (through movement) and illusion. Other than San Francisco Bay Area pride, turfing avoided becoming a fad due to local turf dance competitions and local youth programs that promote turfing {{as a form of}} physical activity.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving employs {{non-linear}} <b>storytelling,</b> {{forcing the}} player {{to piece together}} the narrative. During gameplay, objectives and guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects. The player has little control over the game mechanics and is only able to move freely and pick up objects as needed to progress. Several optional actions, such as drinking alcohol, are available at several stages of the game.|$|E
5|$|When {{developing}} its next game, Insomniac usually works on games it considers itself good at making; these focus on <b>storytelling,</b> creative weapons, and third-person gameplay. The company also recognizes {{the importance of}} developing new intellectual properties. The developers thought they were lucky {{to have the opportunity}} to develop them.|$|E
5|$|Winesburg, Ohio was {{received}} well by critics despite some reservations about its moral tone and unconventional <b>storytelling.</b> Though its reputation waned in the 1930s, {{it has since}} rebounded and is now {{considered one of the}} most influential portraits of pre-industrial small-town life in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Written {{in formal}} Malay and {{including}} traditional Minangkabau <b>storytelling</b> {{techniques such as}} pantuns, Sitti Nurbaya touches on the themes of colonialism, forced marriage, and modernity. Well-received upon publication, Sitti Nurbaya continues to be taught in Indonesian high schools. It {{has been compared to}} Romeo and Juliet and the Butterfly Lovers.|$|E
5|$|Yotsuba&! {{is drawn}} {{not in the}} {{vertical}} four-panel strips of Azuma's earlier series, Azumanga Daioh, but in a full-page format, giving him more artistic scope. Azuma's work on Yotsuba&! has been noted for its clean art, detailed backgrounds, and expressive faces. Azuma is also praised for his joyous tone, slice-of-life <b>storytelling,</b> comedic writing, and eccentric yet realistic characters, especially Yotsuba herself.|$|E
