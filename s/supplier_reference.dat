30|$|The {{reference}} activities used {{to determine}} the calibration parameters are traceable to one standard activity. The calibration procedure was designed to support a multicenter study using the same supplier of 124 I for the study-related patient scans as for the calibration procedure [3, 11]. Since production and activity assessment protocols used by the supplier are standardized, activities used in the calibration procedure and for patient scans in the multicenter study are traceable to a higher standard. In this way, difficulties with activity assessment by dose calibrators as described by Beattie et al. are overcome [17]. However, if in the future multicenter studies using isotopes are produced by more than one <b>supplier,</b> <b>reference</b> activities should be related to a higher, preferably international, primary standard [18]. Potentially, organizations like EARL or EATRIS could play a pivotal {{role in the development of}} these standards [12, 19].|$|E
40|$|Scientific studies {{regarding}} specifically references do {{not seem}} to exist. However, the utilization of references is an important practice for many companies involved in industrial marketing. The purpose of the study is to increase the understanding about the utilization of references in international industrial marketing in order to {{contribute to the development of}} a theory of reference behavior. Specifically, the modes of reference usage in industry, the factors affecting a <b>supplier's</b> <b>reference</b> behavior, and the question how references are actually utilized, are explored in the study. Due to the explorative nature of the study, a research design was followed where theory and empirical studies alternated. An Exploratory Framework was developed to guide a pilot case study that resulted in Framework 1. Results of the pilot study guided an expanded literature review that was used to develop first a Structural Framework and a Process Framework which were combined in Framework 2. Then, the second empirical phase of the case study was conducted in the same (pilot) case company. In this phase, Decision Systems Analysis (DSA) was used as the analysis method. The DSA procedure consists of three interviewing waves: initial interviews, reinterviews, and validating interviews. Four reference decision processes were identified, described and analyzed in the form of flowchart descriptions. The flowchart descriptions were used to explore new constructs and to develop new propositions to develop Framework 2 further. The quality of the study was ascertained by many actions in both empirical parts of the study. The construct validity of the study was ascertained by using multiple sources of evidence and by asking the key informant to review the pilot case report. The DSA method itself includes procedures assuring validity. Because of the choice to conduct a single case study, external validity was not even pursued. High reliability was pursued through detailed documentation and thorough reporting of evidence. It was concluded that the core of the concept of reference is a customer relationship regardless of the concrete forms a reference might take in its utilization. Depending on various contingencies, references might have various tasks inside the four roles of increasing 1) efficiency of sales and sales management, 2) efficiency of the business, 3) effectiveness of marketing activities, and 4) effectiveness in establishing, maintaining and enhancing customer relationships. Thus, references have not only external but internal tasks as well. A <b>supplier's</b> <b>reference</b> behavior might be affected by many hierarchical conditions. Additionally, the empirical study showed that the supplier can utilize its references as a continuous, all pervasive decision making process through various practices. The process includes both individual and unstructured decision making subprocesses. The proposed concept of reference can be used to guide a reference policy recommendable for companies for which the utilization of references is important. The significance of the study is threefold: proposing the concept of reference, developing a framework of a <b>supplier's</b> <b>reference</b> behavior and its short term process of utilizing references, and conceptual structuring of an unstructured and in industrial marketing important phenomenon to four roles...|$|R

The paper views customer relationships from the resource-based perspective and offers insights into how a firm’s customer relationships can be leveraged as assets to build growth and competitive advantage through reference utilization. We suggest that for an industrial supplier operating in business markets, an important marketing capability is to systematically build, manage and utilize the firm's reference customer relationship portfolio. Several routines and tools for building, managing and utilizing reference customer relationship portfolios are identified through an explorative multiple {{case study in}} three industrial companies.

40|$|It {{has been}} found from the {{contemporary}} research {{in the fields of}} supply chain management and concurrent engineering that significant benefits can be achieved if suppliers are involved in product development. However, recent investigations in manufacturing industries have revealed that early supplier involvement in the design process is not widely practiced. One issue is the lack of an appropriate customer-supplier interface to assess the suitability of <b>suppliers</b> with <b>reference</b> to design criteria. This paper proposes a mechanism for evaluating supplier involvement during product development. The assessment tool includes four types of distinctive indices to measure supplier involvement in the design process, namely: Satisfaction Index, Flexibility Index, Risk Index, and Confidence Index.

40|$|Purpose - Research {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that supplier involvement in the design process is not widely practised. Aims to discuss {{the lack of an}} appropriate customer-supplier interface to assess the suitability of <b>suppliers</b> with <b>reference</b> to design criteria. Design/methodology/approach - The paper proposes a mechanism for evaluating supplier involvement during product development. The assessment tool includes four types of indices to measure supplier involvement in design, namely: satisfaction index, flexibility index, risk index, and confidence index. These indices measure the extent to which both the customer requirements and the supplier capabilities match or mismatch and therefore reflect the potential or risk of signing a project contract. Findings - Analysis within a multinational telecommunications company indicates that the selection methodology assists in reducing the product development timeframe since it automates the evaluation process and provides the procurement team with a flexible and responsive tool for assessing prospective suppliers. Research limitations/implications - Additional work is required to investigate the integration of other design factors, such as accessibility, degree of innovation and relationship type. Practical implications - The methodology has been refined and a prototype internet site has been developed to demonstrate a proof-of-the-concept. A number of benefits and limitations of the system are identified. Originality/value - First, it identifies the need to define design-related criteria for supplier involvement during the product development process. Second, a methodology is proposed which takes into consideration the ability of suppliers to provide solutions beyond the requirements specified by the customer and provides a mechanism for measuring the degree of uncertainty or risk associated with using a supplier. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} the application of the World Wide Web (WWW or web) technology to facilitate the early supplier involvement in new product development. The paper focuses on two parts of the resulting web-based system. The first part is the Bid Explorer underpinned by a bid model which is based on design specification. The bid model consists of inquiries which in turn have values of different types. Inquiries are represented in a hierarchical tree. The bid model is collaboratively established by, and thereafter commonly shared between, the customer and all the interested suppliers. From {{the point of view of}} the customer, the inquiries are their requirements. In contrast, from the supplier's viewpoint the inquiries are their capabilities. The second part of the system is the Partnership Explorer which is underpinned by a partnership model. This partnership model uses four types of numeric partnership indices, namely satisfaction index (SI), flexibility index (FI), risk index (RI), and confidence index (CI). The SI is based on the overlap between the customer requirements and supplier capabilities. The FI is based on the surplus of the supplier capabilities in relation to the customer requirements. The RI is evaluated through the shortage of the <b>supplier</b> capabilities with <b>reference</b> to the customer requirements. The CI is based on the past performance records of a supplier. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2011. Gaia Power is a South African {{start-up}} in the {{renewable energy}} industry. Among other products, {{they developed a}} wave energy converter, which is a device {{used to extract energy}} from ocean waves. This research deals with the economic feasibility study of the wave energy converter. Wave energy is a young field of research, especially in the South African context. Therefore sources for multiple angles of the project had to be found, analysed and brought into the Gaia Power context. Understanding the cost drivers of a wave energy plant was the foundation of the research itself. The Gaia Power specific levelised cost of electricity generation was calculated based on actual <b>supplier</b> quotes, <b>reference</b> costs found in the literature as well as assumptions. Still, such a calculation is actually more an estimation due to a high uncertainty level in all cost components. Especially the construction cost as well as the discount rate used have therefore been tested for sensitivity. Gaia Power‟s target production cost was R 0. 54 kWh, which equalled the Eskom tariff {{at the time of this}} research. Taking into account a R 0. 10 /kWh fee payable to Eskom, the target cost sank to R 0. 44, which is about 25 percent lower than the minimum value for electricity generation cost found in the literature. This target was therefore expected to be and proved to be difficult to reach. The calculated levelised electricity cost was R 0. 99 /kWh, with a possible range of R 0. 54 /kWh to R 1. 60 /kWh observed in the sensitivity analysis. These results show that the Gaia Power wave energy converter in the given specifications was not economically feasible. It was therefore recommended to rethink the specifications in order to reduce construction cost, which proved to be the largest cost driver. Besides the quantitative findings, this research also has a strong qualitative side. During the whole research it became obvious that there was an overall high risk level in the project due to the lack of experience with wave energy in general and in South Africa specifically, as well as the high impact of weather on the construction. Those risks were identified, analysed and recommended mitigation actions were derived...|$|R
40|$|When {{calibrating}} spatial partial equilibrium {{models with}} conjectural variations, some modelers fit the suppliers' {{sales to the}} available data in addition to total consumption and price levels. While this certainly enhances {{the quality of the}} calibration, it makes it difficult to accommodate user-imposed bounds on the model parameters such as restricting the market power parameters to the interval [0, 1], which is a common requirement in conjectural variations approaches. We propose an algorithm to calibrate the suppliers' sales and simultaneously deal with user-defined bounds on parameters. To this end, we fix the suppliers' sales at reference values and obtain the marginal costs for each supplier and market. We then limit the market power parameters to the interval [0, 1], and calculate intervals of anchor prices and price elasticities that reproduce the <b>reference</b> <b>supplier</b> sales in the state of equilibrium. If these intervals do not contain the reference price elasticities and prices, we face a mismatch between reality and the model mechanics. We resolve this by altering the reference sales for the critical suppliers, and iterate. Thereby, the user controls whether price elasticities and anchor prices should be close to their reference values, or the suppliers' sales. The algorithm is tested on data from the European gas market, and required less than one minute to identify calibrated parameters. Our algorithm is widely applicable, since it is based on mild (and common) underlying assumptions and can be configured to suit a specific purpose thanks to the inclusion of user-defined bounds on all relevant parameters...|$|R
40|$|Lean supply chains with cost {{optimized}} {{production and}} logistics {{processes in the}} automotive industry have become a benchmark for other industries. Short delivery times, low inventories and high availability are parameters which assume a robust supply chain. In industrial practice we see, however, that in the After Sales business particularly related to the supply of automotive spare parts, that there are always unforeseen delays in delivery. In order to avoid service level losses on the focal firm level due to missing parts {{it is necessary to}} understand the risk structure on the supplier side. For this reason, a risk model for the After Sales inbound SC is developed through this work. Based on an extensive analysis of delivery data a central risk size was derived. Comprehensively researched SC risks are supplemented by After Sales specific risks derived through an empirical <b>supplier</b> survey. A <b>reference</b> network, which is methodologically based on the Bayesian theorem, to control the dynamic relationships was developed. The developed risk model allows for the identification of proactive and reactive measures by top-down and bottom-up analyzes to make lean supply chains for after sales requirements in the best cases robust and resilient. A big advantage of the developed model is not only the ability to quantify the cause and effect of supply chain risks but also to describe the constantly changing risk environment of the supply chain through continuous belief updates within the model. The risk analysis in the developed model potentially reduces the delivery delay of spare parts by 65 percent and diminishes the buffer stock value by 50 percent. To achieve such improvements in the real world organizations must be able to implement measures in explicit SC risk clusters for sustainable supply chain performance and inventory management. Improvements in the internal supplier processes, due to risks like prioritized series supply, or inappropriate after sales supply strategies are necessary. Utilizing the developed After Sales Risk Management Model (ASRIM) organizations will be able to implement proactive risk mitigation strategies, facilitating agile SC performance, while simultaneously reducing buffer stocks...|$|R
40|$|Maintaining {{sufficient}} {{levels of}} competition {{ranks among the}} core interests of any national – and increasingly international – antitrust policy; however, the formal proof that a cartel really functioned economically and did not only exist in a legal sense is hard to deliver: market power is not identical {{to the existence of}} a legal cartel unless the monopolistic frontier is reached; the legal proof of a cartel does not imply that the market was harmed. From an economic point of view, focusing on legal proof of a cartel is fruitless unless collusion resulted in excess profits or excess revenues. This economic evidence, however, rests empirically on the proper definition of comparable markets, and a sound statistical methodology. When in spring 2003, the German Antitrust Agency (GAA) fined the German cement industry – € 661 million for having established quotas {{in each of the four}} market regions through the end of 2001, the legal issue seemed beyond doubt as, beside formal inquiries, two of the industry members had acted as key witnesses. However, the economic implications drawn by the GAA remain doubtful. In this paper, we use the quota agreement in the East German market, the region for which these allegations are undisputed by all major <b>suppliers,</b> as a <b>reference</b> case. We challenge the GAA’s computation of excess income of 10 €/ton on two grounds: (i), the comparative market period chosen, 2002, does not meet the requirements of a reference market, especially regarding a certain level of stability and converging prices; (ii) three parallel developments could have triggered the price decline: the openly announced end of the quota cartel, which generated general price-setting insecurity (ii-a), the price war triggered by one of the oligopolists, who desperately tried to improve poor utilization of capacity and squeeze out competitors (ii-b), and the general decline in construction activity (ii-c). Within the framework of an econometric model based on data of one German cement producer, we find that sufficient levels of competition prevailed throughout the cartel period. Furthermore, the demand structure did not change from 2001 to 2002 so as to suggest a fundamental change in competition. Finally, no excess income or profit can be computed. In fact, we show that the general demand regime estimated for the period 1995 to 2001, which is the period of alleged market power, equally well describes the market condition of 2002. Price war and a collapsing construction market lead suppliers to maintain levels of production and capacity utilization, thus sacrificing profits at the expense of the market shares of small and medium-sized suppliers independently from the cartel issue. This empirical finding of an agreed but ineffective cartel is supported by theoretical evidence on the conditions under which cartels can work effectively – which did not exist in the East: strong import competition, a high level of transparency limiting the effects of „cheap talk“ and spatial pricing that generates local market power in the absence of cartels. Furthermore, general supply-side conditions in the cement industry suggest that a considerable level of imperfect competition is structurally unavoidable; antitrust possibilities that in the short run enforce additional competition based on the wrong assessment of effective collusion may lead to exits and less competition in the long run. We conclude that the methodology described may be useful for antitrust policy as it offers a credible analytical tool to compute excess income and profit.
