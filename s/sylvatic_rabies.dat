Evolutionary analysis suggests the virus diverged from canine rabies viruses in Sri Lanka in ≈ 1933 (range 1886 – 1963). Rabies has been eliminated from domestic animals in industrialized countries, but <b>sylvatic</b> <b>rabies</b> remains an endemic disease. The ecology of rabies in wildlife populations and natural ecosystems is poorly understood (1), and, as a result, eliminating rabies {{from the wild}} is difficult. Little is known about <b>sylvatic</b> <b>rabies</b> in developing countries, where rabies takes its biggest toll on humans. Rabies is endemic to Sri Lanka and has been identified in different wild animals. However, all documented cases of rabies in wildlife in Sri Lanka have been considered a consequence of spillover from dogs. Rabies viruses circulating {{in this country are}} distinctly highly homogeneous (2, 3). Two species of palm civet are commonly found in Sri Lanka: the common palm civet, Paradoxurus hermaphroditus, which is widespread in southern Asia and Southeast Asia, and the golden palm civet, P. zeylonensis, which is indigenous to Sri Lanka. This species is closely related to the brown palm civet (P. jerdoni), which lives only in southern India (4).

Three antigenic variants were found: 1, 3, and 5. Antigenic variant 1 included all samples from dogs and humans infected by contact with rabid dogs. Unique substitutions permitted identification of two separate outbreaks of dog rabies in the Maracaibo Depression and Los Llanos region and in the Andean region of Venezuela. Samples from the vampire bat and two head of cattle were characterized as antigenic variant 3 and showed a nucleotide sequence homology of 96 to 98 % {{to each other and}} to samples of vampire bat-associated rabies throughout Latin America. Ten of the remaining 12 samples were characterized as antigenic variant 5. Genetic studies indicated that 11 of these samples formed a highly homologous and distinctive group but were closely related to samples of vampire bat-associated rabies. The 12 th sample of variant 5 (from a cat) showed only 78 to 80 % genetic homology to samples of rabies associated with vampire bats.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Describe the {{epidemiology}} {{and the control}} effort for rabies in Ecuador. METHODS: This observational study included data from the Ecuadorian National Institute of Census and Statistics (INEC), and mortality and morbidity data reported by the Ministry of Public Health and the National Institute for Social Security. We conducted a phylogeny analyses to compare the N gene from the Challenge Virus Standard (CVS) vaccine strain used in Ecuador with published Cosmopolitan, Asian and Sylvatic strains. Descriptive and inferential statistics {{were used to determine}} the significance of the data. RESULTS: In 1996 Ecuador suffered the highest rate of rabies per capita in the Americas, with an incidence rate of 0. 56 cases per 100 000 people per year. Human and canine rabies showed a sharp decline until 2012. Between 1994 and 2014, we found a correlation of 0. 925 (p< 0. 01) between annual cases of dog and human rabies. In 2011, there was an epidemic of <b>sylvatic</b> <b>rabies</b> transmitted to people by vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) in the Amazon region, specifically in Morona Santiago, leading to 11 fatalities. Phylogenetic analyses of the CVS vaccine N gene showed an association with urban canine rabies strains (the Cosmopolitan lineage and Asian strains), whereas <b>sylvatic</b> <b>rabies,</b> like those reported in the Amazon region, were found to be grouped in a different clade represented mainly by bat-derived strains. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents the first compilation of epidemiological data on rabies in Ecuador. The incidence of human and canine rabies, also known as urban rabies, has clearly decreased due to massive canine vaccination campaigns. Phylogenetic analysis of the prevailing vaccine used in the country showed a clear separation from bat-derived rabies, the source of recent rabies outbreaks. Efforts are ongoing to develop rabies vaccines that are highly specific to the rabies virus genotype circulating in the region, including <b>sylvatic</b> <b>rabies.</b> These efforts include the implementation of reverse genetics to generate recombinant virus coding for the prevailing glycoprotein gene.

A total of 381 households from communities covered by the outbreak response activities were surveyed. Despite being associated with poorer dwelling conditions, the possession of domestic animals is associated with the perception of an increase in bat bites among animals. Better dwelling conditions, use of protective measures, access to electricity, and no domestic animals are variables associated with the perception of a rise in attacks on humans.

40|$|<b>Sylvatic</b> <b>rabies</b> {{has been}} {{eradicated}} {{from most of}} Central Europe, but cases still occur in the Balkans. Oral rabies vaccination of foxes is an effective method for controlling the disease. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the success of aerial vaccination campaigns conducted in Montenegro by identifying ecological, environmental and climatic factors that influenced the prevalence of antibodies to the rabies vaccine. To monitor the bait uptake and the serological responses to vaccination, foxes were shot by hunters. Of 175 shot foxes, 142 foxes (81. 1 %) had consumed baits. Of these only a total of 81 (57. 0 %) tested positive for rabies vaccine antibodies, possibly, due to the delayed uptake of bait in which the rabies vaccine was already inactivated. We found that low vaccination responses were associated with high fox density and bait delivery in open areas. In high fox density habitat, bait uptake might be delayed as other food and prey options for foxes are abundant. Similarly, delayed bait uptake probably occurred in open areas as such areas are less frequently used by foxes. The findings of this study suggest that efficacy of oral rabies vaccination by aerial delivery is associated with landscape features...|$|E
40|$|The current rabies {{situation}} in Europe is probably unprecedented in history. Large parts of Western, Northern and Central Europe are officially recognized as free from terrestrial rabies. This achievement {{is the result}} of stepwise intensive efforts to control and eliminate both urban (canine) and sylvatic (wildlife-mediated) rabies. Although canine rabies was yet successfully controlled using strict implementation of hygienic measures in several European countries {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century, Europe-wide elimination was accomplished by registration and mass vaccination of dogs in the 1970 s. In contrast, the emergence of fox rabies in the 1940 s as a result of a transition from urban to <b>sylvatic</b> <b>rabies</b> posed a new challenge and required fundamental changes in rabies control policies. Early attempts to control fox rabies aiming at a drastic decimation of the fox population to interrupt the infectious cycle failed and were suggested as counterproductive. The increasing rabies incidence required alternative rabies control methods. In 1970 s, the concept of oral rabies vaccination (ORV) offered a new perspective for rabies control in wildlife. However, appropriate tools yet had to be developed from scratch.

40|$|Abstract. Twenty-eight {{samples from}} humans and {{domestic}} and wild animals collected in Mexico between 1990 and 1995 {{were characterized by}} using anti-nucleoprotein monoclonal antibodies and limited sequence analysis of the nucleoprotein gene. The variants of rabies viruses identified in these samples were compared with other isolates from Mexico {{and the rest of}} the Americas to establish epidemiologic links between cases and outbreaks and to increase the understanding of rabies epidemiology in the Western Hemisphere. Antigenic and genetic diversity was found in all samples from dogs and dog-related cases, suggesting a long-term endemic situation with multiple, independent cycles of virus transmission. Two isolates from bobcats were antigenically and genetically homologous to the rabies variant circulating in the Arizona gray fox population, indicating a wider distribution of this variant than previously reported. Rabies isolates from skunks were unrelated to any variant analyzed in this study and represent a previously unrecognized cycle of rabies transmission in skunks in Baja California Sur. Two antigenic and genetic variants co-circulating in southern and eastern Mexico were found in viruses obtained from cases epidemiologically related to vampire bats. These results serve as a baseline for the better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of rabies in Mexico.

40|$|Background: In {{rural area}} of a {{community}} block, four rabies deaths within 19 days following exposure, in spite of receiving Post exposure Prophylactic vaccination warranted epidemiological investigation and situational analysis to take up remedial measures if any. Methodology: A detailed epidemiological study was planed. The component of the study included eco-geographical evaluation {{of the study area}} by visit, post exposure clinic-epidemiological evaluation of survivors by clinical examination and interview, verbal autopsy from the kith and kin of the four dead cases, enquiries on practice of standard protocol by health providers an health seeking behaviour of the cases/families involved through interview and immunological analysis for measuring the titers of antirabies antibodies in sera of some patients following exposure/vaccination. All the 36 cases bitten by rabid Jackal were contacted and interviewed. Family contacts of all four who died were also interviewed. Block Medical Officer of the area was also interviewed. Result: It was found that man made alterations in eco- geographical features were leading to increase in exposure risks to <b>sylvatic</b> <b>rabies.</b> It was found that standard protocol for Post Exposure Prophylaxis was not in practice and health providers and other related agencies needed reorientation on conduct of post exposure prophylaxis.

EpW. f 1968, 88 : 132 - 138. —The CVS strain of rabies virus was transmitted orally to neonatal mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, and rabbits. Older mice (10 days, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks), weanling guinea pigs, rabbits, and ham-sters also {{proved to be}} susceptible. Oral transmission was routinely observed in mother mice following the cannibalism of their infant mice previously infected with virus. Transmission of virus to infant mice from an infected mother was demon-strated on rare occasions, {{but this was not}} readily reproducible. The mechanism of transmission from mother to offspring was not dear. Speculation on the signifl [...] cance of oral rabies infection in the epidemiology of <b>sylvatic</b> <b>rabies</b> focuses on the possible importance of the ingestion of dead or dying rabid animals and the trans-fer of virus from mother to young. The need for repetition of these observations using street viruses is stressed. Natural {{transmission of}} rabies via the oral route has been generally held by most authorities to be exceedingly rare. Earlier experiments with oral trans-mission in species such as the dog, fox, sheep, and horse were not successful (1), and it was concluded that rabies virus would not survive the gastric juices (2). Milk from infected animals was shown to contain virus occasionally (3) and although consumption of milk from rabid cows was considered inad-visable, transmission of rabies virus in this manner was considered highly un-likely (3, 4).

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, {{incidence}} of human infection with rabies virus (RABV) spread by the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) increased considerably in South America, especially {{in remote areas}} of the Amazon rainforest, where these bats commonly feed on humans. To better understand the epizootiology of rabies associated with vampire bats, we used complete sequences of the nucleoprotein gene to infer phylogenetic relationships among 157 RABV isolates collected from humans, domestic animals, and wildlife, including bats, in Peru during 2002 – 2007. This analysis revealed distinct geographic structuring that indicates that RABVs spread gradually and involve different vampire bat subpopulations with different transmission cycles. Three putative new RABV lineages were found in 3 non–vampire bat species that may represent new virus reservoirs. Detection of novel RABV variants and accurate identification of reservoir hosts are critically important for the prevention and control of potential virus transmission, especially to humans. Rabies virus (RABV; family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus) is a bullet-shaped, single-stranded, negativesense RNA virus with a 12 -kb genome that encodes 5 structural proteins: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein, matrix protein, glycoprotein, and polymerase (1). Over the course of its evolutionary history, RABV has established independent transmission cycles in diverse species of mesocarnivores and bats. Rabies disease remains a serious public health concern in several countries of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, where it is estimated that> 50, 000 fatal infections occur annually (2).

From winter 2009 to autumn 2016, a total of 15 ORV campaigns (four emergency, four regular and seven preventive ORV) were implemented through aerial distribution of baits. In this study, we assessed the costs of the aerial ORV campaigns, which were aimed at eradicating the disease and reobtaining the rabies-free status. Cumulative costs per km(2) were estimated at € 59. 45 during emergency campaigns and ranged between € 51. 94 and € 65. 67 in the regular vaccinations. The main portion of costs for ORV programmes were related to baits supply and distribution: € 49. 24 (82. 83 %) in emergency campaigns and from € 40. 33 to € 43. 35 in regular ORVs (71. 97 % and 66. 02 %, respectively). At the end of each ORV campaign, the efficacy of vaccination activities was estimated by assessing the proportion of foxes testing positive for tetracycline biomarker in jawbone, indicating bait intake.

In June 2003, a horse imported to Finland from Estonia was clinically and laboratory diagnosed as rabies positive. The close relationship of the isolated equine virus strain with the current Estonian strains was verified during subsequent molecular epidemiological studies. Because the case was imported, it did not affect Finland’s rabies-free status. Also in 2007 another 2 imported cases of rabies were recorded: one in a human being from Philippines and the other in a dog from India. Five different antigenic variants of the rabies virus were identified among rabies positive field samples from Russia, Finland, and Estonia by using antinucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies. Two rabies virus field isolates showed a different reaction pattern that was {{similar to that of the}} vaccine strains of the SAD group, which might suggest a new antigen variant or reverted vaccine strain. Nevertheless, the sequence analysis showed that the vaccine strains RV- 97 and SAD B 19 included in the oral anti-rabies vaccine “Sinrab” (Russia) and “Fuchsoral” (Germany), respectively, differ considerably from all the field strains. Field rabies viruses collected in recent years from different regions of the Russian Federation were chosen on the basis of mAb studies and geographical origin for molecular epidemiological studies to characterize their genetic heterogeneity and to study their molecular epidemiology. In addition to the Russian viruses, archival samples from Estonia and Finland and Russian vaccine strains were also included in this study. Among the field viruses studied, two main phylogenetic groups were found, and designated as the Pan-Eurasian and Caucasian based on their geographical origin. The Pan-Eurasian 7 group including some reference viruses from Europe was further divided into four subgroups. All the vaccine strains were clearly different from the field strains. No recombination between the field and vaccine virus strains was observed. The critical roles of geographical isolation, the limitation of the genetic clustering, and the evolution of the rabies virus were shown during this study. The rabies virus vaccine strain RV- 97 is widely used in Russia as a component of the oral anti-rabies vaccine “Sinrab”. To characterize the molecular properties of this strain, entire genome sequencing was conducted. A simple technique was developed to obtain this sequence, including the 3 ’- and 5 ’- ends. The entire genome sequence and deduced amino-acid sequences of the major viral proteins were compared with the sequences of other known fixed rabies viruses. The strain RV- 97 formed a separate phylogenetic branch and seems to be more related to the group of Japanese strains. The field strains from the Caucasian group seem to be phylogenetically the nearest group to the RV- 97 strain. The data shown herein makes it possible to develop molecular methods for distinguishing between the field rabies viruses from the vaccine strains for the rapid recognition of the vaccine strains that are unstable or have reverted back to their pathogenic form.
