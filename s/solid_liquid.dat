5|$|An atom is the {{smallest}} constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every <b>solid,</b> <b>liquid,</b> gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms.

5|$|Plasma is a {{state of}} matter in which an ionised gaseous {{substance}} becomes highly electrically conductive to the point that long-range electric and magnetic fields dominate the behavior of the matter. This state can be contrasted with the other states: <b>solid,</b> <b>liquid,</b> and gas. Unlike these other states of matter, plasma mostly does not naturally exist on the Earth's surface under normal conditions, and must be artificially generated from neutral gases.|$|E

25|$|Waste {{polycarbonate}} will degrade at {{high temperatures}} to form <b>solid,</b> <b>liquid</b> and gaseous pollutants. A {{study showed that}} the products were about 40–50 wt.% liquid, 14–16 wt.% gases, while 34–43 wt.% remained as solid residue.

25|$|The carbon {{can come}} from a <b>solid,</b> <b>liquid</b> or gaseous source; if {{it comes from a}} solid source the process is called pack carburizing.

25|$|Packing {{fraction}} – The {{packing fraction}} is a parameter borrowed from physics {{to define the}} organization (or state i.e. <b>solid,</b> <b>liquid,</b> or gas) of 3D fish groups. It is an alternative measure to density. In this parameter, the aggregation is idealized as an ensemble of solid spheres, with each fish {{at the center of}} a sphere. The packing fraction is defined as the ratio of the total volume occupied by all individual spheres divided by the global volume of the aggregation (Cavagna 2008). Values range from zero to one, where a small packing fraction represents a dilute system like a gas.|$|E
25|$|A biofuel is a {{fuel that}} {{contains}} energy from geologically recent carbon fixation. These fuels are produced from living organisms. Examples of this carbon fixation occur in plants and microalgae. These fuels {{are made by}} a biomass conversion (biomass refers to recently living organisms, most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials). This biomass {{can be converted to}} convenient energy containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in <b>solid,</b> <b>liquid,</b> or gas form. This new biomass can be used for biofuels. Biofuels have increased in popularity because of rising oil prices and the need for energy security.|$|E
25|$|Most rocket {{engines are}} {{internal}} combustion heat engines (although non combusting forms exist). Rocket engines generally produce a high temperature reaction mass, as a hot gas. This {{is achieved by}} combusting a <b>solid,</b> <b>liquid</b> or gaseous fuel with an oxidiser within a combustion chamber. The extremely hot gas is then allowed to escape through a high-expansion ratio nozzle. This bell-shaped nozzle is what gives a rocket engine its characteristic shape. The effect of the nozzle is to dramatically accelerate the mass, converting most of the thermal energy into kinetic energy. Exhaust speed reaching as high as 10 times {{the speed of sound}} at sea level are common.|$|E

25|$|Biofuels {{include a}} wide range of fuels which are derived from biomass. The term covers <b>solid,</b> <b>liquid,</b> and gaseous fuels. Liquid {{biofuels}} include bioalcohols, such as bioethanol, and oils, such as biodiesel. Gaseous biofuels include biogas, landfill gas and synthetic gas. Bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermenting the sugar components of plant materials and it is made mostly from sugar and starch crops. These include maize, sugarcane and, more recently, sweet sorghum. The latter crop is particularly suitable for growing in dryland conditions, and is being investigated by International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics for its potential to provide fuel, along with food and animal feed, in arid parts of Asia and Africa.|$|E
25|$|In {{a typical}} MS procedure, a sample, {{which may be}} <b>solid,</b> <b>liquid,</b> or gas, is ionized, for example by bombarding it with electrons. This may cause some of the sample's {{molecules}} to break into charged fragments. These ions are then separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio, typically by accelerating them and subjecting them to an electric or magnetic field: ions of the same mass-to-charge ratio will undergo {{the same amount of}} deflection. The ions are detected by a mechanism capable of detecting charged particles, such as an electron multiplier. Results are displayed as spectra of the relative abundance of detected ions {{as a function of the}} mass-to-charge ratio. The atoms or molecules in the sample can be identified by correlating known masses to the identified masses or through a characteristic fragmentation pattern.|$|E
25|$|In {{magnetic}} confinement reactors, hydrogen gas (usually a 50-50 mixture of two heavier isotopes of ordinary hydrogen, namely deuterium and tritium) is heated to very high temperatures (about 150 million degrees Celsius). At these high temperatures electrons separate from hydrogen nuclei {{and the gas}} becomes plasma, which {{is often referred to}} as the fourth state of matter, the others being <b>solid,</b> <b>liquid</b> and gas. By controlling, or confining, the flow of plasma in test reactors, engineers can cause hydrogen nuclei to collide and fuse – creating for short amounts of time a nuclear fusion reaction that generates heat. One of the unsolved challenges of controlled nuclear fusion energy is to sustain a reaction that generates more energy than what goes into just maintaining the operation of the reactor plasma itself.|$|E
