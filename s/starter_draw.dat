40|$|Abstract—Because {{wireless}} microsystems {{can only}} incorporate tiny batteries, they typically exhaust stored on-board energy quickly. Fortunately, harvesting ambient energy {{is a viable}} means of extending their operational lifetimes, except starting and re-starting miniaturized microwatt harvesters from nocharge conditions is difficult. The challenge is drawing usable energy from millivolt signals under micro-scale constraints. This paper proposes a nonlinear on-chip starter that borrows the harvester's steady-state inductor to start the system from nocharge conditions. Simulations show that the <b>starter</b> <b>draws</b> power from 250 – 500 mV to charge 100 pF to 3 V in 48 µs. The 100 -pF temporary supply then powers the harvester's 1 -V, 4 -µA controller to charge 100 nF by 100 mV in 65 -µs cycles until the 100 -nF battery charges enough to supply the system.

40|$|Objectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the susceptibility of an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator to electromagnetic interference in an electrically hostile work site environment, with the ultimate goal of allowing the patient to return to work. Background. Normal operation of an implanted cardioverterdefibrillator depends on reliable sensing of the heart's electrical activity. Consequently, there is concern that external electromagnetic interference from external sources in the work place, especially welding equipment or motor-generator systems, may be sensed and produce inappropriate shocks or abnormal reed switch operation, temporarily suspending detection of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Methods. The effects of electromagnetic interference on the operation of one type of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (Medtronic models 7217 and 7219) was measured by using internal event counter monitoring in 10 patients operating arc welders at up to 900 A or working near 200 -hp motors and 1 patient close to a locomotive <b>starter</b> <b>drawing</b> up to 400 A. Results. The electromagnetic interference produced two sources of potential interference on the sensing circuit or reed switch operation, respectively: 1) electrical fields with measured frequencies up to 50 MHz produced by the high currents during welding electrode activation, and 2) magnetic fields produced by the current in the welding electrode and cable. The defibrillator sensitivity was programmed to the highest (most sensitive) value: 0. 15 mV (model 7219) or 0. 3 mV (model 7217). The ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation therapies were temporarily turned off but the detection circuits left on. Conclusions. None of the implanted defibrillators tested were affected by oversensing of the electric field as verified by telemetry from the detection circuits. The magnetic field from 225 -A welding current produced a flux density of 1. 2 G; this density was not adequate to close the reed switch, which requires ∼ 10 G. Our testing at the work site revealed no electrical interference with this type of defibrillator. Patients were allowed to return to work. The following precautions should be observed by the patient: 1) maintain a minimal distance of 2 ft (61 cm) from the welding arc and cables or large motors, 2) do not exceed tested currents with the welding equipment, 3) wear insulated gloves while operating electrical equipment, 4) verify that electrical equipment is properly grounded, and 5) stop welding and leave the work area immediately if a therapy is delivered or a feeling of lightheadedness is experienced...|$|R
50|$|Kaltack, {{initially}} {{played with}} Vanuatu's U-17 squad at the 2009 OFC U-17 Championship where Vanuatu finished fourth {{out of four}} teams. He continued with the team at the 2011 edition, scoring five goals as they again finished fourth. Three months later, he debuted with Vanuatu's U-20 squad at the 2011 OFC U-20 Championship where he received the Golden Boot with six goals as Vanuatu finished third. His performances for the youth teams eventually got him a call-up into Vanuatu's senior team {{for a pair of}} friendly matches against the Solomon Islands towards the end of July 2011. He featured in both matches as a <b>starter</b> as they <b>drew</b> one and won one. He also scored 16 goals in 2015 Pacific Games against Federated States of Micronesia national under-23 football team.|$|R
40|$|It is {{stated that}} the social science {{curriculum}} for gifted junior high school students can be enriched by drawing from psychology, sociology, and anthropology. An overview of instruction {{in the social sciences}} includes specification of subject matter emphases in grades 7 - 9, definition of major goals (process, personal, and situational goals) in social sciences, and consideration of the 'requirements for a successful program (small classes, exciting topics, reasonable grading, cultural exposure, communication with parents, variety). Conduct of research projects at each of the three grade levels is discussed, and five steps involved in carrying out a research project are outlined. Provided are some sample applications of research skills, in which the method used is to begin inductively and end deductively, and some sample stimulus questions or discussion <b>starters</b> concerning language <b>drawn</b> primarily from the fields of psychology and sociology. Finally the field-study method as a means of developing creativity is presented, and numerous provocative topics for interviews or classroom study are listed. The appended list of suggested books for students includes nonfiction, fiction, biography, and reference works. (KW) po. : 04 [...] . f,. " 10111811...|$|R
