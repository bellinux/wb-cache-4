5000|$|Diagnosis of {{arteritis}} {{is based}} <b>on</b> <b>unusual</b> medical <b>symptoms.</b> [...] Similar symptoms {{may be caused}} by a number of other conditions, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome (both heritable disorders of connective tissue), tuberculosis, syphilis, spondyloarthropathies, Cogans’ syndrome, Buerger's, Behcet's, and Kawasaki disease. [...] Various imaging techniques may be used to diagnose and monitor disease progression. Imaging modalities may include direct angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, and ultrasonography.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Patients with {{cervical}} (CDRS) or lumbar dorsal ramus syndrome (LDRS) {{are characterized}} by neck or low back pain with referred pain to upper or lower extremities. However, we experienced some CDRS or LDRS patients with unusual motor or bladder symptoms. We analyzed and reviewed literatures <b>on</b> the <b>unusual</b> <b>symptoms</b> identified in patients with CDRS or LDRS. Methods: This study included patients with <b>unusual</b> <b>symptoms</b> and no disorders of spine and central nervous system, a total of 206 CDRS/LDRS patients over the past 3 years. We diagnosed by using double diagnostic blocks for medial branches of dorsal rami of cervical or lumbar spine with 1 % lidocaine or 0. 5 % bupivacaine for each block with an interval of more than 1 week between the blocks. Greater than 80 % reduction of the <b>symptoms,</b> including <b>unusual</b> <b>symptoms,</b> was considered as a positive response. The patients with a positive response were treated with radiofrequencyneurotomy. Results: The number of patients diagnosed with CDRS and LDRS was 86 and 120, respectively. Nine patients (10. 5 %) in the CDRS group had <b>unusual</b> <b>symptoms,</b> including 4 patients with motor weakness of the arm, 3 patients with tremors, and rotatory torticollis in 2 patients. Ten patients (8. 3 %) in the LDRS group showed <b>unusual</b> <b>symptoms,</b> including 7 patients with motor weakness of leg, 2 patients with leg tremor, and urinary incontinence in 1 patient. All the <b>unusual</b> <b>symptoms</b> combined with CDRS or LDRS were resolved after treatment. Conclusion: It seems that the clinical presentationssuch as motor weakness, tremor, urinary incontinence without any othe...|$|R
40|$|What's {{already known}} about this topic? There is {{increasing}} neuroimaging evidence of parietal lobe involvement in CRPS. Severe tactile allodynia and <b>unusual</b> <b>symptoms</b> such as body dysmorphia and finger agnosia have also been documented. - What does this study add? Clinical evidence was found for parietal lobe dysfunction in CRPS. Cortical network dysfunction in CRPS may involve parietal areas, and could provide a rationale explanation for otherwise <b>unusual</b> <b>symptoms</b> and signs. The extent of tactile allodynia correlated with the severity of parietal dysfunction, suggesting a role for maladaptive neuroplasticity...|$|R

40|$|Patients {{presenting}} with <b>unusual</b> <b>symptoms</b> are uncommon. <b>Unusual</b> <b>symptoms</b> often {{catch the}} attention of the public including the health professionals. Atypicality in the symptoms is usually seen in patients with factitious disorder. In patients with factitious disorder, there occurs conscious production of symptoms with an unconscious motive, irrespective of the fact whether they are ill or not. Self-inflicted injuries to skin often give rise to typical skin lesions known as dermatitis artefacta, which many a times simulate other dermatological conditions. Patients with factitious disorder often have a narrow line of demarcation from malingering.

40|$|Chest radiographs are {{obtained}} routinely after {{central venous catheter}} (CVC) insertion in many institutions, although it consumes time and money. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the role of post-procedural chest X-ray in detecting complications of CVC insertion; we performed CVC insertion without using ultrasonography guidance. A total of 454 patients who required an emergency vascular access for hemodialysis between February 2008 and March 2010 were included in this study. In cases where three to five unsuccessful attempts were encountered to place the CVC or pierce the artery, we used another site for CVC placement or we placed the CVC under ultrasonographic guidance. Both the internal jugular and the subclavian veins were used as routes for catheter insertion. All the catheters were dual lumen and were inserted by the same vascular access surgeon. All the catheters were inserted using the same protocol. This protocol consists of five stages including position, percutaneous anesthesia, puncture, pull out and placement. Chest radiography was obtained after the procedure and patients were interviewed for the presence of any <b>unusual</b> <b>symptoms.</b> The X-rays were reviewed by a radiologist who was unaware of the patients′ symptoms. Complications occurred in two patients who had <b>unusual</b> <b>symptoms</b> after the placement of the catheter. Although immediate postprocedural chest radiography is recommended for tip position confirmation, it should not be considered a reliable procedure for detecting complications in the absence of clinical symptoms. It is recommended to monitor patients after catheter insertion and perform delayed chest X-ray in the presence of any <b>unusual</b> <b>symptoms...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{onset of}} a seizure {{may be hard}} to detect since the frontal lobes contain and {{regulate}} many structures and functions about which relatively little is known.

30|$|In conclusion, this is {{believed}} to be the first case report of the simultaneous occurrence of intestinal obstruction caused by a vitelline vascular remnant and appendicitis successfully treated with laparoscopic surgery. Achieving a definitive preoperative diagnosis of a vitelline vascular remnant might be difficult, especially in patients with coexisting appendicitis. When young patients demonstrate <b>unusual</b> <b>symptoms,</b> surgeons should consider the possibility of a vitelline vascular remnant, and laparoscopic surgery should be considered because it allows for simultaneous diagnosis and treatment.|$|R
