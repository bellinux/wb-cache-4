5|$|On {{the return}} to Earth, a bearing at the Guam {{tracking}} station failed, potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return. A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year-old son Greg use his <b>small</b> <b>hands</b> to reach into the housing and pack it with grease. Greg later was thanked by Armstrong.|$|E
5|$|Tonelli {{retired after}} the Games. His aquatic success was not derived from any {{physical}} advantage, {{as he was}} relatively small for a swimmer. He was only 185cm tall and weighed 70kg, with relatively <b>small</b> <b>hands</b> and feet. Tonelli felt that his success was based around his ability to make fast starts from the blocks, and attributed his success to his mental approach {{and his ability to}} convert his energy into a fast swim in under one minute. He had a deliberate strategy of making himself nervous before the race, feeling that he thrived on pressure.|$|E
5|$|Glass beads for {{jewellery}} {{have traditionally}} been made in Hebron. Blue beads and glass beads with 'eyes' (owayneh) were made for use as amulets since they were considered particularly effective against the evil-eye. In the Museum of Mankind collections, there exist several glass necklaces that were made in Hebron during the Mandate period or earlier. Besides necklaces made of blue and green beads, and 'eyes' beads, there are examples of beads of <b>small</b> <b>hands,</b> also called a Hamsa, representing the hand of Fatimah, {{the daughter of the}} prophet Muhammad. Most of a woman's jewellery was given to her at marriage; in the early 1920s, in Bayt Dajan, a glass bracelet (ghwayshat) made in Hebron would be considered a necessary part of the jewellery of a bride's trousseau.|$|E

25|$|Patients {{suffer from}} dwarfism, short lower arms, small feet, and <b>small</b> <b>hands.</b> Fingers and toes {{may also be}} {{abnormally}} short and laterally or medially bent. The thumb may be displaced and some patients, notably in Turkey, experience ectrodactyly. All patients often suffer from vertebral segmentation abnormalities. Those with the dominant variant have, at most, a single butterfly vertebra. Those with the recessive form, however, may suffer from hemivertebrae, vertebral fusion, and rib anomalies. Some cases resemble Jarcho-Levin syndrome or spondylocostal dysostosis.|$|E
25|$|With the forelimbs being {{approximately}} 64% of the hindlimbs, Postosuchus had <b>small</b> <b>hands</b> bearing five toes. Only {{the first}} toe bore a large claw, {{which was used}} as an offensive weapon, and the forelimbs were robust, probably to hold the prey. The feet were much larger than the hands, with the fifth metatarsal forming a hook shape. The halluxes were more slender than the other toes and the marginal ones could not touch the ground. Being a crurotarsan, the heel and ankle of Postosuchus resemble those of modern crocodiles.|$|E

25|$|The hand {{may also}} relate to older traditions in various other {{religions}} in the Ancient Near East. In {{the art of}} the Amarna period in Egypt under Akhenaten, the rays of the Aten sun-disk end in <b>small</b> <b>hands</b> to suggest the bounty of the supreme deity. Like the hamsa amulet, the hand is sometimes shown alone on buildings, although {{it does not seem to}} have existed as a portable amulet-type object in Christian use. It is found from the 4th century on in the Catacombs of Rome, including paintings of Moses receiving the Law and the Sacrifice of Isaac.|$|E
25|$|Compared to autoloading handguns, a {{revolver}} is often much simpler to operate {{and may have}} greater reliability. For example, should a semiautomatic pistol fail to fire, clearing the chamber requires manually cycling the action to remove the errant round, as cycling the action normally depends on the energy of a cartridge firing. With {{a revolver}}, this is not necessary as none of the energy for cycling the revolver comes from the firing of the cartridge, but is supplied by the user either through cocking the hammer or, in a double-action design, by just squeezing the trigger. Another significant advantage of revolvers is superior ergonomics, particularly for users with <b>small</b> <b>hands.</b> A revolver's grip does not hold a magazine, {{and it can be}} designed or customized much more than the grip of a typical semi-automatic. Partially because of these reasons, revolvers still hold significant market share as concealed carry and home-defense weapons.|$|E
500|$|Beecham {{was educated}} at Rossall School between 1892 and 1897, {{after which he}} hoped to attend a music {{conservatoire}} in Germany, but his father forbade it, and instead Beecham went to Wadham College, Oxford, to read Classics. [...] He did not find university life to his taste and successfully sought his father's permission to leave Oxford in 1898. He studied as a pianist, but had difficulty because of his <b>small</b> <b>hands,</b> and any career as a soloist was ruled out by a wrist injury in 1904. He studied composition privately with Frederic Austin in Liverpool, Charles Wood in London, and Moritz Moszkowski in Paris. As a conductor, he was self-taught.|$|E

500|$|McCoy {{was drafted}} {{in the third round}} as the 85th overall pick by the Cleveland Browns in the 2010 NFL Draft. One {{reporter}} commented that McCoy was drafted later than expected because [...] "he lacks NFL size..., has <b>small</b> <b>hands</b> and was injured in the last game of his career at Texas." [...] In response to being chosen by Cleveland, McCoy said, [...] "I can't wait to be a Cleveland Brown and that we're going to win a lot of games. Cleveland has a little orange in their jerseys just like UT. It's a perfect fit." [...] On July 23, McCoy agreed to terms on a four-year, $5 million contract.|$|E

His {{face was a}} perfect oval, his hair was as black as a raven's wing, {{and his eyes were}} large and of that peculiar soft, melting blackness, which excites pity when one is in distress. His skin was a clear, dark olive, bordering on the swarthy, and this, with his high cheek bones, would have led us to suppose that his nationality was different from our own, had we not known that his name was plain Henry P. There was an air of good breeding and refinement about him, that, with his <b>small</b> <b>hands</b> and feet, would have set us to thinking, had it not been that in our youth and intensely enthusiastic natures, we gave no thought to our comrades' personal appearance. We can look back now and see the shy, reserved nature of the boy, the dark, melancholy eyes, the sad smile, the sensitive twitching of the lips.|$|E

And if I catch you and my son again in any public {{restaurant}} I will thrash you" [...] to which Wilde responded: [...] "I don't know what the Queensberry rules are, but the Oscar Wilde rule is to shoot on sight". His account in De Profundis was less triumphant: [...] "It was when, in my library at Tite Street, waving his <b>small</b> <b>hands</b> in the air in epileptic fury, your father... stood uttering every foul word his foul mind could think of, and screaming the loathsome threats he afterwards with such cunning carried out". Queensberry only described the scene once, saying Wilde had [...] "shown him the white feather", meaning he had acted in a cowardly way. Though trying to remain calm, Wilde saw that he was becoming ensnared in a brutal family quarrel. He did not wish to bear Queensberry's insults, but he knew to confront him could lead to disaster were his liaisons disclosed publicly.|$|E

Playing point guard developed Gwynn's baseball skills, as the dribbling strengthened his wrists—avoiding what he called [...] "slow bat syndrome"—and basketball taught him to be quick, which improved his baserunning. He could dunk a basketball, though {{he was unable to}} palm the ball with his <b>small</b> <b>hands.</b> He had a quick first step in either sport, and was able to run [...] in 6.7 seconds.|$|E
