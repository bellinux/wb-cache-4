Avoiding direct contact with infected surfaces such as communal changing rooms and shower floors and benches, avoiding sharing of <b>shoes</b> <b>and</b> <b>socks</b> and avoiding contact with warts on {{other parts of the}} body and on the bodies of others may help reduce the spread of infection.

25|$|Even {{though the}} Bulls {{generally}} wear black footwear {{in the playoffs}} since 1989, {{there have been some}} notable exceptions. In the 1995 playoffs against the Magic, when Michael Jordan debuted his Air Jordan XI shoe, he wore the white colorway during the Bulls' playoff games in Orlando. He was fined by the Bulls for not complying with their colorway policy. During the 2009 playoffs, the Bulls again broke the tradition when all of their players wore white <b>shoes</b> <b>and</b> <b>socks</b> in Game 3 of the first round against the Boston Celtics. More recently, since the NBA's relaxation of sneaker color rules, some Bulls players wore either red or white sneakers in defiance of the tradition.|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 1969, dacron blue made a {{comeback}} to the uniform with a force-wide change away from khaki overnight, {{in part to}} coincide with Singapore's 150th anniversary {{since its founding in}} 1819. The new uniform comprises a dark blue peak cap, shirt, trousers, black belt, <b>shoes</b> <b>and</b> <b>socks,</b> and coded whistle lanyard in blue and white. 3 large and 4 small metal buttons, metal collar badges, and a metal cap badge are affixed, and a black plastic name tag completes the uniform. Metallic ranks, if any, are fixed to the sleeve or on the shoulders for senior officers. The lanyard was changed to a metal chain in 1972, and in 1985, the material of the uniform was changed from 75% polyester 25% cotton to 100% polyester for ease of daily maintenance.|$|E

25|$|The first {{murder for}} which Bonin was charged {{was that of}} a 13-year-old {{hitchhiker}} named Thomas Glen Lundgren. Lundgren was last seen leaving his parents' house in Reseda at 10:50a.m. on the morning of May 28, 1979: his body, clad only in a T-shirt, <b>shoes</b> <b>and</b> <b>socks,</b> was found the same afternoon in Agoura. An autopsy revealed that Lundgren had suffered emasculation and bludgeoning to his face and head, with his skull sustaining multiple fractures. In addition, the youth had been slashed across the throat, extensively stabbed, and strangled to death. His underwear, jeans, and severed genitals were discovered strewn in a field close to his body. In the abduction and murder of Lundgren, Bonin was assisted by Vernon Butts, who is suspected of accompanying or assisting Bonin on at least eight further murders attributed to the Freeway Killer.|$|E
