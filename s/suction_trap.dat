40|$|To {{compare the}} {{efficiency}} of collecting methods by structural characterisation of a neuropteroid community the authors carried out an investigation in a commercial apple orchard at Szigetcsép by using three different trapping techniques, Malaise trap, <b>suction</b> <b>trap</b> and light trap. Considering of the individuals of this community, the <b>suction</b> <b>trap</b> {{seems to be the}} most useful sampling device outrunning the material caught by light trap and especially those of Malaise trap. During the investigation the <b>suction</b> <b>trap</b> and light trap show the numbers of the species and individuals of Coniopterygidae, Hemerobiidae and Chrysopidae families in a similar way. To record snake flies, Raphidiidae, Malaise trap seems to be the most suitable sampling device while the light trap is the best for sponge flies, Sisyridae. Abundance of Hemerobius humulinus and Wesmaelius subnebulosus was underestimated by Malaise trap compared with the records of suction trap; however Micromus angulatus and Micromus variegatus were overestimated by Malaise trap. Comparing the results of light trap to <b>suction</b> <b>trap</b> Hemerobius humulinus, Wesmaelius subnebulosus and Chrysoperla carnea complex were underrepresented while Micromus angulatus, Micromus variegatus, Chrysopa formosa and Chrysopa phyllochroma were overestimated. Diversity profiles drawn by different sampling techniques show that the diversity of the <b>suction</b> <b>trap</b> samples, except for the beginning of the scale parameter, is significantly (p < 0. 01) lower in its total length from the values of light trap and Malaise trap. In the profile of plots of light trap and Malaise trap the diversity of the samples were not different in the species with medium and higher abundance. In conclusion, the sampling techniques used in the ecological investigations can determine the characteristics of neuropteroid communities. These results show that sampling devices have to be chosen cautiously according to the main aims and the interpretation of investigations...|$|E
40|$|The same Neuropteroidea {{community}} was collected and studied in Hungary {{in the years}} 1991 and 1992 by using different trapping techniques: a) Malaise trap, b) <b>suction</b> <b>trap,</b> c) yellow pan trap and d) light trap. The studies aimed to compare the different sampling methods for individual species, families and for the whole Neuropteroidea community. In case the whole Neuropteroidea community the trapped individual numbers collected by the <b>suction</b> <b>trap</b> surpassed all other trap types. Relatively high numbers of Neuropteroidea could be collected both by light trap and Malaise traps. The yellow pan traps {{did not succeed in}} catching large enough samples neither from point of view of sample size nor from species richness. According to the number of species collected there were not discovered any big difference between the catches of <b>suction</b> <b>trap,</b> Malaise traps and light trap. By evaluating according to families it was stated that in case of the family Raphidiidae the Malaise trap yielded larger and more diverse samples than any other methods; however by increasing the number of yellow pan traps it is possible to augment the number of caught individuals. The suction traps were found very satisfactory in collecting members of the family Coniopterygidae. For the members of the families Hemerobiidae and Chrysopidae both the suction traps and light traps were found effective, although suction traps were more successful in collecting Chrysopidae species. Similarly, by evaluating the data according to individual species {{it was found that the}} Malaise traps tended to “under-represent” species belonging to Hemerobius humulinus, Hemerobius Lutescens, Chrysopa pallens and the ones belonging to Chrysoperla carnea complex compared to the <b>suction</b> <b>trap.</b> The opposing situation was perceived with Micromus lanosus and Chrysopa perla. Similarly – compared to <b>suction</b> <b>trap</b> – the light trap significantly “under-represented” the species Hemerobius humulinus, Hemerobius lutescens, Chrysopa pallens, Chrysoperla carnea and Dichochrysa prasina and “over-represented” Micromus angulatus, Sympherobius pygmaeus and Chrysopa phyllochroma. The diversity of Neuropteroidea collected by Malaise trap and light trap surpassed significantly the one of <b>suction</b> <b>trap</b> and yellow pan traps.

40|$|Host {{preference}} {{is an important}} determinant of feeding behaviour in biting insects and a critical component in the transmission of vector-borne diseases. The aim {{of the study was}} to quantify Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) host preferences and biting rates using tethered livestock at pasture (a dairy cow and a sheep) and to compare the numbers of biting midges aspirated off them to those captured simultaneously in a black-light <b>suction</b> <b>trap</b> acting as a surrogate host. Culicoides collections were made hourly over seven hours (from five hours before official sunset to two hours after) between 27 May and 19 June, 2013 at a dairy farm (eastern Netherlands). The study involved 13 replicates of a site×host randomised design. Culicoides collected by black-light <b>suction</b> <b>trap</b> and by direct aspiration were identified to species morphologically and age-graded. The C. obsoletus complex, C. dewulfi and C. pulicaris predominated on the back and flanks of the animals, C. punctatus on the belly, and C. chiopterus on the legs. Using comparable collection periods, 9. 3 times (95 % confidence interval: 8. 6 - 10. 0) more Culicoides were caught on the cow than on the sheep and 25. 4 times (95 % confidence interval: 18. 4 - 35. 1) less in the black-light <b>suction</b> <b>trap</b> compared to the sheep. Mean Culicoides biting rates on the cow across the 7 -h collection period were 4. 6, 3. 5, 1. 0, 1. 0 and 0. 5 min- 1 for C. dewulfi, the C. obsoletus complex, C. chiopterus, C. punctatus and C. pulicaris, respectively; for the sheep they were 0. 6, 0. 4 and 0. 1 min- 1 for the C. obsoletus complex, C. dewulfi and C. punctatus, respectively. Though midges were aspirated off livestock during each of the seven hours, they only began to appear in the black-light <b>suction</b> <b>trap</b> 5 h later, from sunset onwards. After sunset, its efficacy improved markedly, but occurred when midge activity overall had begun to decline. Though it was quite accurate in ranking Culicoides species abundance, the black-light <b>suction</b> <b>trap</b> proved to be of limited value for determining hours of peak biting activity, levels of abundance, and host preference, in Culicoides.

We assessed, by coupling demographic and genetic methods, the relative contribution of local and transient migrants of the grain aphid Sitobion avenae to wheat field colonization in spring. 2. We examined, during two consecutive years, the daily colonization of wheat by aphid migrants and compared this with daily aphid flight monitored by a local 12. 2 -m <b>suction</b> <b>trap.</b> The genetic profiles of aphids landing on crops were compared with those of both flying aphids caught by the <b>suction</b> <b>trap</b> and local populations from arable crops and hedgerows. 3. In the first year, we observed: (i) a strong correlation between aphids colonizing the crop and those moving within the crop and a close genetic similarity between aphids from these samples and (ii) a high level of genetic differentiation between these aphids and populations from local cereals and field margins. In the second year, the number of migrants recorded on the wheat was three-fold higher than in the previous year, and less correlated with that recorded by the <b>suction</b> <b>trap.</b> This was associated with a lack of genetic differentiation between all samples. 4. This variation in the colonization processes resulted mainly in an abrupt increase in abundance of genotypes from local over-wintering sites in 2004. This suggests that, despite the long range dispersal potential of the grain aphid, outbreak risks could be mainly determined at a local scale, encouraging the design of relatively small management units...|$|E

40|$|Many {{species of}} {{farmland}} birds have shown huge declines in numbers and range since the 1970 s due to agricultural intensification, and these declines have been worst amongst granivorous species.

A armadilha de água coletou sempre maior número de indivíduos do que a de sucção, durante todo o período de observações. Entretanto, as curvas que representam as variações semanais e mensais do número de migrantes da espécie, construídas com as amostras obtidas por ambos os tipos de armadilhas, têm a mesma forma. As maiores migrações se deram nos meses de maio a setembro. A proporção de exemplares de M. persicae em relação ao total das espécies coletadas foi sempre maior na armadilha de água do que na de sucção. _________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTA {{study was}} made of the seazonal {{variations}} in the numbers of migrants of the aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) at Campinas, State of São Paulo, by sampling aerial populations from 1967 through 1969, with a <b>suction</b> <b>trap</b> and a yellow water trap. Weekly catches were recorded for both traps and summed up to give month totals. Alate viviparous parthenogenetic females of Myzus persicae were caught every week of the years of 1967 to 1969. This is an evidence that in the Campinas region (22 ° 50 ' S) there was no limiting factor to suppress parthenogenetic reproduction and inhibit flight during the period of observations. However, the trapping of males seems to indicate that an holocyclic multiplication of Myzus persicae may also exist. Where the oviparous female or other morphs of the species does also accur at Campinas, is not known. The period when most of migration took place as revealed by samples taken by both traps occurred from May to September. The yellow water trap caught more Myzus persicae than the <b>suction</b> <b>trap,</b> but curves of annual distribution of alates trapped have the same shape. The ratio between the numbers of this aphid in the two types of traps remained rather constant, throughout two years, varying from 2. 3 to 6. 0. This means that water trap catches were related to estimates of aerial density produced by the <b>suction</b> <b>trap,</b> a more precise apparatus for this determination, which does not exert attraction to the aphid species (20). Thus water trap may be used to the best advantage to collect Myzus persicae where an electricity supply to run the <b>suction</b> <b>trap</b> is lacking and / or when numbers of alate in the air are low. The proportion of Myzus persicae in relation to the total of species caught was also higher for the yellow water trap. In February, March, June, July and October of 1967 and June and July of 1968, 50 % of aphid species caught in the water trap were Myzus persicae. It represents 35 % of total caught from May to October of 1969. In the <b>suction</b> <b>trap</b> the highest proportion of this species was 20 % in June, 1968.

40|$|International audienceDispersal {{strategies}} {{and success of}} pests' natural enemies widely influence the efficiency of biological control.

Using previously described electrophoretic 'keys', the species of hymenopterous parasitoids present in individual aphids were identified and found to be Aphidius ervi (Haliday) and/or Aphidius rhopalosiphi (De Stephani Perez) (Braconidae).
