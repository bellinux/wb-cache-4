5000|$|Refueling the {{compressed}} air container using {{a home or}} low-end conventional air compressor may {{take as long as}} 4 hours, though specialized equipment at service stations may fill the tanks in only 3 minutes. To store 2.5 kWh @300 bar in 300 liter reservoirs (90 m3 of air @ 1 bar), requires about 30 kWh of compressor energy (with a single-stage adiabatic compressor), or approx. 21 kWh with an industrial standard multistage unit. That means a compressor power of 360 kW is needed to fill the reservoirs in 5 minutes from a single <b>stage</b> <b>unit,</b> or 250 kW for a multistage one. [...] However, intercooling and isothermal compression is far more efficient and more practical than adiabatic compression, if sufficiently large heat exchangers are fitted. Efficiencies of up to 65% might perhaps be achieved, (whereas current efficiency for large industrial compressors is max. 50% [...] ) however this is lower than the Coulomb's efficiency with lead acid batteries.|$|E
40|$|For large, {{national}} surveys, stratified {{two stage}} sample designs are frequently used. In these surveys, unequal probability sampling {{is almost always}} used {{in the selection of}} first <b>stage</b> <b>units.</b> Typically, the sampling procedure does not allow these first <b>stage</b> <b>units</b> to be selected more than one time (i. e., without replacement). This design has several desirable properties, but one major problem: the estimation of sampling errors can be quite complicated. One frequently used estimator of variance for two stage sample designs is Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR). In BRR, variance is estimated from "balanced " half-samples constructed from the original sample. BRR has been shown to produce unbiased estimates of variance for linear estimators when sampling takes place using with replacemen...|$|R

40|$|Three {{separate}} estimators, for {{the estimation}} of the population total, based on two-stage sampling design on two successive occasions with partial replacement of secondary stage units only have been presented. For these estimators {{it is assumed that}} there is unit non-response. Hence, Hansen and Hurwitz (1946) technique has been used to adjust for the non-response. Empirically, it has been found that the estimator that uses individual weights within first stage units perform better than the other estimators that use common weights in estimating the population total. Theoretically, it has also been shown that the larger the ratio of the within first <b>stage</b> <b>unit</b> variability of the non-respondents to the between first <b>stage</b> <b>unit</b> variability the higher the gain in efficiency of the proposed estimators over the estimator obtained when there is no partial matching of units...|$|E
40|$|The cyclic or {{sequencing}} batch {{activated sludge}} process {{was applied for}} the treatment of septage originating from cesspools serving non-sewered areas. Single and two stage systems were investigated in bench scale units. The single stage aerated system was capable in removing practically all the biodegradable COD and producing a well stabilised excess sludge with excellent settling and thickening characteristics. With respect to nitrogen the average removal rate was to the order of 70 %, but the performance was unstable due to periodic strong inhibition of the nitrification process. Subsequent treatment in a second stage aerated unit improved nitrification but did not result in higher nitrogen removal rates due to the increased concentrations of oxidised nitrogen, An anoxic second stage post denitrification unit resulted in an overall nitrogen removal of 88 %, through a substantial reduction of nitrates. Further improvement of the system, with nitrogen removal of about 95 % and average effluent nitrogen concentrations lower than 10 mg. l(- 1), can be achieved by adoption of a two stage system consisting of a first aerated <b>stage</b> <b>unit,</b> followed by a second <b>stage</b> <b>unit</b> with alternating aerated and anoxic cycles and addition of external carbon during the anoxic cycle...|$|E

However, such detection {{is affected by the}} transparency of water and the working skills of divers, usually requires considerable time for high-resolution sampling, and always damages the survey site. We developed a new automatic non-destructive acoustic measurement system that visualizes the space under the water bottom, and tested the system in the in situ detection of natural plant roots. The system mainly comprises a two-dimensional waterproof stage controlling unit and acoustic measurement unit. The <b>stage</b> <b>unit</b> was electrically controlled through a notebook personal computer, and the space under the water bottom was scanned in a two-dimensional plane with the <b>stage</b> <b>unit</b> moving in steps of 0. 01 m (± 0. 0001 m). We confirmed a natural plant root with diameter of 0. 025 – 0. 030 m in the reconstructed three-dimensional acoustic image. The plant root was at a depth of about 0. 54 m and the propagation speed of the wave between the bottom surface and plant root was estimated to be 1574 m/s. This measurement system for plant root detection will be useful for the non-destructive assessment of the status of the space under the water bottom...|$|E

40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} {{analysis is}} presented {{for the two}} stage thermal compression process for an adsorption refrigeration cycle with HFC- 134 a as the working fluid and activated carbon as the adsorbent. Three specimens of varying achievable packing densities were evaluated. The influence of evaporating, condensing/adsorption and desorption temperatures was assessed through three performance indicators, namely,the uptake efficiency, the coefficient of performance and the exergetic efficiency. Conditions under which a two stage thermal compression process performs better than the single <b>stage</b> <b>unit</b> are identified. It is concluded that two stage thermal compression will be a viable proposition when the heat source temperature is low or when adsorption characteristics are weak or when adequate packing densities are difficult to realize.

40|$|Transonic {{axial flow}} {{compressors}} are fundamental components in aircraft engines {{as they make}} it possible to maximize pressure ratios per <b>stage</b> <b>unit.</b> This is achieved through a careful combination of both tangential flow deflections and, above all, by taking advantage of shock wave formation around the rotor blades. The resulting flow field is really complex as it features highly three-dimensional inviscid/viscous structures, strong shock-boundary layer interaction and intense tip clearance effects which negatively influence compressor efficiency. Complications are augmented at part load operation, where stall—related phenomena occur. Therefore, considerable research efforts are being spent, both numerically and experimentally, to improve efficiency and stall margin at peak efficiency and near stall operation. The present work aims at giving a complete review of the most recent advances in the field of aerodynamic design and operation of such machines. A great emphasis has been given to highlight the most relevant contribution in this field and to suggest the prospects for future developments...|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that pulse width flow modulation (PWFM) {{can be used}} to design fasts accurate, and precise multi-stage dilution modules for microfluidic devices. The PWFM <b>stage</b> <b>unit</b> presented here yields 10 -fold dilution, but several PWFM stages can be connected in series to yield higher-order dilutions. We have combined two stages in a device thus capable of diluting up to 100 -fold, and we have experimentally determined a set of rules that can be conveniently utilized to design multistage diluters. Microfabrication with resist-based molds yielded geometrical channel height variances of 7 % (22. 9 (16) mu m) with corresponding hydraulic resistance variances of similar to 20 %. Pulsing frequencies, channel lengths, and flow pressures can be chosen within a wide range to establish the desired diluter properties. Finally, we illustrate the benefits of on-chip dilution in an example application where we investigate the effect of the Ca 2 + concentration on a phospholipid bilayer spreading from a membrane reservoir onto a SiO 2 surface. This is one of many possible applications where flexible concentration control is desirable...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a contact}} time {{optimization}} methodology of a two-stage batch adsorber system taking minimum contact {{time as the}} objective function has been developed. The initial concentration of the second <b>stage</b> <b>unit</b> and adsorbent weight have been designated as variables and these have been studied under two conditions of the equilibrium solid-phase concentration, q(e), namely, when q(e) is a variable and when q(e) is a constant. Contact time optimization of a two-stage batch adsorber system has been demonstrated at three different conditions/cases for the adsorption of phenol on activated carbon and the adsorption of Astrazone Blue dye (Basic Blue 69) onto silica. A new concept of "pinch point" for the optimum design of batch adsorber system has been proposed. The optimization solutions {{show that there is}} a significant difference for minimum contact time at different process conditions. The diffusion mass transport model used to predict the concentration-time decay curve is a film-pore diffusion model. An analytical solution has been used for simplicity which assumes a constant capacity pseudo-irreversible isotherm. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for short-term scheduling of multi-stage multi-product batch plants. The model determines the optimal sequencing and {{the allocation of}} customer orders to non-identical processing units by minimizing the earliness and tardiness of order completion. This is a highly combinatorial problem, especially when sequence-dependent relations are considered such as the setup time between consecutive orders. A common approach to this scheduling problem relies on the application of tetra-index binary variables, i. e. (order, order, <b>stage,</b> <b>unit)</b> to represent all the combinations of order sequences and assignments to units in the various stages. This generates {{a huge number of}} binary variables and, as a consequence, much time is required for solutions. This paper proposes a novel formulation that replaces the tetra-index binary variables by one set of tri-index binary variables (order, order, stage) without losing the model's generality. By the elimination of the unit index, the new formulation requires considerably fewer binary variables, thus significantly shortening the solution time. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Industrial {{compressor}} manufacturers {{often have}} to respond instantly to new impeller designs or in an aftermarket situation to modification of an existing impeller. To deal with this, design from scratch {{is out of the}} question and de-signers often rely on their experience to design by scaling or modification. A compressor designer’s wish is to have one single <b>stage</b> <b>unit</b> design with good performance that can cover a wide rang of applications and a wide range of mass flow rates. This means a stage whose impeller and diffuser chocking areas can be varied, which is not impossible but difficult. Currently there are five main ways of dealing with this: 1. Varying the angle of the inlet guides (if guide vanes are there) 2. Narrowing the impeller flow passage depth (impeller exit width trimming) 3. Varying the inlet angle of the diffuser vanes 4. Radial cropping of the impeller vanes 5. Radial cropping of the diffuser vanes This paper discusses item No. 2, impeller exit width trimming. On the basis of experimental data for two impellers, one with a low flow coefficient and the other with a high flow coefficient, the effect of impeller exit width trimming is studied and discussed. The effect on overall performance, blade loading and impeller diffusion is examined...|$|E
40|$|Marine shallow-water to {{emergent}} volcanoes {{have been}} described in detail, but comparable englacial centres are not well documented. Brown Bluff is a Pleistocene, shallow water, alkali basaltic volcano whose deposits were ponded within an englacial lake, enclosed by ice > 400 m thick. Its evolution is divided chronologically into pillow volcano, hyalotuff cone, slope failure and hyaloclastite delta/subaerial stages. Seventeen lithofacies and five structural units (A-E) are recognised and described. The pillow volcano <b>stage</b> (<b>Unit</b> A) is {{similar to those of}} many submarine seamount volcanoes. It comprises extrusive and intrusive pillow lavas draped by slumped hyaloclastite. Units B and D define the hyalotuff cone stage, which was centred on a summit vent(s), and comprises slumped, poorly sorted hyalotuffs redeposited downslope by sediment gravity flows and ponded against an ice barrier. This stage also includes water-cooled subaerial lavas and massive hyalotuffs ponded within a crater. Cone construction was interrupted by drainage of the lake and slope failure of the northeast flank, represented by debris avalanche-type deposits (Unit C). Unit E represents the youngest stage and consists of a Gilbert-type hyaloclastite delta(s), which prograded away from a summit vent(s), and compound subaerial lavas.

40|$|The need to {{standardise}} stratigraphical subdivisions {{of continuous}} marine sedimentary successions that out- crop for hundreds metres, using clearly deﬁned points ﬁxed in the ﬁeld is strongly felt. A proposal is presented here to formalize regional stages for the Lower Pleisto- cene (Calabrian) {{and for the}} Middle Pleistocene (Ion- ian) in Italy. The sections are well exposed, carefully investigated using multiple criteria (an integrated strati- graphical approach) and located in {{the central part of}} the Mediterranean. This area is recognized worldwide as a classical region for the Neogene and the Pleistocene sequences. The terrestrial record is directly correlated with the deep-sea record, as determined from ODP Sites 653 (Tyrrhenian Sea), 963 (Sicily Channel) and 964 (Ion- ian Sea) from the central Mediterranean.

40|$|The {{sampling}} design adopted {{for the study}} was a two-stage self-weighting design in which the first <b>stage</b> <b>units</b> were Census Enumerator Sub-Districts (ESDs) or their equivalents and the second stage were households. The sampling frame was drawn up {{on the basis of}} small clearly demarcated area units, each with a population estimate. In the sample design chosen, the area <b>stage</b> <b>units</b> were selected with probability proportional to size, based on the census population. Systematic sampling was used throughout, that is, sampling at a fixed interval in a list of ESDs, beginning at a randomly selected starting point. To ensure that the racial and geographic breakdown approximated the national population distribution, the area <b>stage</b> <b>units</b> (ESDs) were listed by statistical region and within the statistical region by urban or rural. Within these sub-statistical regions, the ESDs were then listed in order of percentage African. The sampling interval for the selection of the ESDs was obtained by dividing the 1991 ensus population of 38 120 853 by the 360 clusters to be selected. This yielded 105 800. Starting at a randomly selected point, every 105 800 th person down the cluster list was selected. In the second sampling <b>stage</b> the <b>unit</b> of analysis was the household. In selected ESD a listing or enumeration of households was carried out by means of a field operation. From the households listed in an ESD a sample of households was selected by systematic sampling. Even though the ultimate enumeration unit was the household, in most cases "stands" were used as enumeration units. However, when a stand was chosen as the enumeration unit all households on that stand had to be interviewed. The latest census population data, however, was available only for 1991. An assumption on population growth was thus made to obtain an approximation of the population size for 1993, the year of the survey. The sampling interval {{at the level of the}} household was determined in the following way: Based on the decision to have a take of 125 individuals on average pe cluster (i. e. assuming five members per household to give an average cluster size of 25 households), the interval of households to be selected was determined as the census population divided by 118. 1, i. e. allowing for population growth since the census...|$|R
