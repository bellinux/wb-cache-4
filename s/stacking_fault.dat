50|$|While {{the model}} was {{developed}} specifically for mechanical milling, {{it has also been}} successfully applied to other SPD processes. Frequently only a portion of the model is used (typically the term involving the <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> energy) as the other terms are often unknown and difficult to measure. This is still useful as it implies that all other things remaining equal, reducing the <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> energy, a property that {{is a function of the}} alloying elements, will allow for better grain refinement. A few studies, however, suggested that despite the significance of <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> energy on the grain refinement at the early stages of straining, the steady-state grain size at large strains is mainly controlled by the homologous temperature in pure metals and by the interaction of solute atoms and dislocations in single-phase alloys.|$|E

50|$|A heavily {{deformed}} metal {{contains a}} huge number of dislocations predominantly caught up in 'tangles' or 'forests'. Dislocation motion is relatively difficult in a metal with a low <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> energy and so the dislocation distribution after deformation is largely random. In contrast, metals with moderate to high <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> energy, e.g. aluminum, tend to form a cellular structure where the cell walls consist of rough tangles of dislocations. The interiors of the cells have a correspondingly reduced dislocation density.|$|E

50|$|A <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> is an {{interruption}} {{of the normal}} stacking sequence of atomic planes in a crystal structure. These interruptions carry a certain stacking-fault energy. The width of <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> {{is a consequence of}} the balance between the repulsive force between two partial dislocations on one hand and the attractive force due to the surface tension of the <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> on the other hand. The equilibrium width is thus partially determined by the stacking-fault energy. When the SFE is high the dissociation of a full dislocation into two partials is energetically unfavorable, and the material deforms only by dislocation glide. Lower SFE materials display wider stacking faults and have more difficulties for cross-slip and climb.The SFE modifies the ability of a dislocation in a crystal to glide onto an intersecting slip plane. When the SFE is low, the mobility of dislocations in a material decreases.|$|E

The bi- and tetralayer graphene provide diffusion pathways with lower energy barriers inside the interlayer space. Inside the bi- and tetralayer graphene with AB stacking, the in-plane diffusion is more favorable than the inter-plane jumping. However, the <b>stacking</b> <b>faults</b> made by sliding layer planes lowers the energy barrier of the inter-plane jumping and the effective frequency of the inter-plane jump is larger {{than that of the}} in-plane diffusion inside the graphene layers with the <b>stacking</b> <b>faults.</b> This suggests that hydrogen atoms can diffuse over a long distance inside few-layered graphene with <b>stacking</b> <b>faults</b> jumping consecutively between adjacent layers. close 0...|$|R

The speed of band propagation {{is proportional to the}} temperature (lower temp lower speeds, higher temp higher speeds). Often time the critical stain will first decrease due to temperature.The temperature effect on PLC regime is causes by the increased ability of the solutes to diffuse to the dislocations with increasing temperature.

50|$|Another {{factor that}} has a {{significant}} effect on the SFE of a material and is very interrelated with alloy content is the e/a ratio, or the ratio of valence electrons to atoms.

He found that the valence-electron to atom ratio is a good predictor of <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> energy, even when the alloying element is changed. This directly supports the graphs on the right. Zinc is a heavier element and only has two valence electrons, whereas aluminum is lighter and has three valence electrons.
