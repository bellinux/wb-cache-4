30|$|Introduction Related to {{the absence}} of {{effective}} diagnostic tools for invasive candidiasis, empirical systemic antifungal therapies are recommended and largely prescribed to the intensive care unit patients with risk factors. However, <b>secondary</b> <b>documented</b> invasive candidiasis is not observed for all the patients who receive an empirical systemic antifungal therapy. The objective {{of this study is to}} define the risk factors able to predict the probability for having a <b>secondary</b> <b>documented</b> invasive candidiasis after empirical systemic antifungal therapy by accounting for center and patient variables.|$|R

The definitive version is available at: [URL] Europeanization literature has extensively examined the influence of the European employment strategy (EES) on Member States' employment policies. However, two least-likely cases – Greece and Portugal – have been neglected in the literature.

Based on a sample of 44 semi-structured interviews and primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>document</b> research on seven reform episodes during 1995 – 2009, it finds that the EES altered Greek and Portuguese employment policies by empowering policy entrepreneurs and, when the latter were absent, through European Social Fund financial conditionality.

The findings may be relevant for a number of EU policies based on voluntarism and EU funds, such as the new flagship EU initiative Europe 2020...|$|E
40|$|After the Sanlu tainted {{milk powder}} crisis in China in 2008, the entire {{powdered}} milk manufacturing industry, {{and in many}} ways the food industry as a whole, faced a crisis of reputation and consumer confidence. Through a study of the organisation and public relationships of dairy companies, the crisis communication strategies they used, and how they cultivated relationships, this paper explores how companies within the milk industry rebuilt their reputations to a point where customers and other key elements of the public once again felt confident about their products. This study explores the organisation­public relationships (OPRs) cultivation strategies of the dairy companies and the communication strategies they used to rebuild the industry&# 039;s reputation after the Sanlu crisis. The author interviewed dairy company personnel and consumers in China (N= 18) and conducted <b>secondary</b> <b>document</b> research. The communication strategies that dairy companies used to maintain their relationship with the public are analysed.

[...] Humboldt State University, Social Science: Environment and Community, 2010 The {{focus of this}} thesis is a Geographic Information System (GIS) based predictive modeling process with results as applied to the Wiyot Cultural Area in Humboldt County, California. Predictive models aim to identify patterns that demonstrate a range of human activities, especially economic maximization and cognitive cultural decisions. This model relied on <b>secondary</b> <b>document</b> analysis in order to recreate the prehistoric environ and identify site type and use areas including historic maps, oral history, ethnographic documents and archaeological site records. Logistic regression was employed to discriminate significance values among the variables derived from the document analysis, selecting the strongest environmental and cultural variables for the modeling process. Topographic setting, distance to prairies, and distance to navigable waterways were selected as variables significant at the 0. 05 level. Distance to freshwater, elevation, and vegetation setting {{did not meet the}} criteria for significance and were excluded. A relative probability map was produced which indicated both site and non-site locations within the study area. Internal and statistical testing showed that although only three variables were employed, the model exhibited a 66...|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{waterfront}} {{communities are}} extremely significant {{in understanding the}} role and influence of {{the daily lives of}} an indigenous amphibious culture and are considered to be a counterpart of the contemporary community that would have existed in the past. This study gives a systematic overview of the traditional waterfront community complex in the Chao Phraya River Basin to identify the phenomenology and salient features characterizing the waterfront community through the analysis of the following: 1) features of geography and waterbodies; 2) cultural landscapes and agricultural activities; 3) urban components; and 4) architectural features. A total of 138 traditional waterfront communities were selected using the purposive sampling method. Quantitative data collection was conducted using field investigation to collect and evaluate the validity of properties in actual conditions. The data were analyzed using a statistical analysis program to examine the similarity and correlation of the data set. To identify characteristics, hierarchical clustering and decision-tree analysis were used to group similar communities together and classify the complexity of a traditional waterfront community. Principal component analysis was then used to detect the true association between the relevant variables. In addition, qualitative assessment of <b>secondary</b> <b>document</b> collection, legislation, previous and present public policies, research, and criticisms were used to support the argument for statistical analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{factors that}} {{contribute}} to postgraduate business student performance and success within an open and distance learning (ODL) environment were investigated. An exploratory research approach was followed in three stages: a structured questionnaire, semi-structured qualitative interviews and a <b>secondary</b> <b>document</b> analysis of the student records. The contributing factors were identified to inform future teaching practices in ODL that may lead to an improvement in student performance, course pass rates and ultimately the throughput rate of qualifications. The contributing factors in this context pertain to formative assessment, student enjoyment of the course, lecturer involvement and attendance of course workshops. Students highly value proactive contact from lecturers in the form of text messages and email communications. Recommendations include a reconsideration of the assessment practices – in particular, the weighting of the contribution of assignments towards the final mark. Offering regular face-to-face sessions with the students – albeit with lecturers or appointed tutors – is recommended. The influence of regular lecturer contact and face-to-face workshops is particularly interesting, considering that the research was conducted at an ODL institution. Additional questions on student learning styles arise regarding the students’ fit with ODL, course design and teaching practices in ODL. This could lead to further research in the South African higher education environmen...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{literature}} on simulated or standardized patient (SP) methodology is expanding. However, {{at the level}} of the program, there are several gaps in the literature. We seek to fill this gap through documenting experiences from four programs in Australia, Canada, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. We focused on challenges in SP methodology, faculty, organisational structure and quality assurance. Methods We used a multiple case study method with cross-case synthesis. Over eighteen months during a series of informal and formal interactions (focused meetings and conference presentations) we documented key characteristics of programs and drew on <b>secondary</b> <b>document</b> sources. Results Although programs shared challenges in SP methodology they also experienced differences. Key challenges common to programs included systematic quality assurance and the opportunity for research. There were differences in the terminology used to describe SPs, in their recruitment and training. Other differences reflected local conditions and demands in organisational structure, funding relationships with the host institution and national trends, especially in assessments. Conclusion This international case study reveals similarities and differences in SP methodology. Programs were highly contextualised and have emerged in response to local, institutional, profession/discipline and national conditions. Broader trends in healthcare education have also influenced development. Each of the programs experienced challenges in the same themes but the nature of the challenges often varied widely. </p...|$|E
