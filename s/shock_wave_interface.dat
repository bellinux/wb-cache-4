40|$|We {{present a}} simple and general {{approach}} to formulate the lattice BGK model for high speed compressible flows. The main point consists of two parts: an appropriate discrete equilibrium distribution function (DEDF) f^eq and a discrete velocity model with flexible velocity size. The DEDF is obtained by f^eq=C^- 1 M, where M {{is a set of}} moment of the Maxwellian distribution function, and C is the matrix connecting the DEDF and the moments. The numerical components of C are determined by the discrete velocity model. The calculation of C^- 1 is based on the analytic solution which {{is a function of the}} parameter controlling the sizes of discrete velocity. The choosing of discrete velocity model has a high flexibility. The specific heat ratio of the system can be flexible. The approach works for the one-, two- and three-dimensional model constructions. As an example, we compose a new lattice BGK kinetic model which works not only for recovering the Navier-Stokes equations in the continuum limit but also for measuring the departure of system from its thermodynamic equilibrium. Via adjusting the sizes of the discrete velocities the stably simulated Mach number can be significantly increased up to 30 or even higher. The model is verified and validated by well-known benchmark tests. Some macroscopic behaviors of the system due to deviating from thermodynamic equilibrium around the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> <b>interfaces</b> are shown.

A new integral definition for the interface thickness was proposed, making it feasible to study {{for the first time the}} time evolution of the thickness of quasi-sinusoidal interfaces. Images of interfaces after interacting with a series of weak waves reverberating between the interface and the shock tube end wall were obtained. The perturbations are studied at the late stages of their evolution, when their amplitude is no longer small compared to their wavelength. Consequently, the measured growth rates of the modal amplitudes are smaller than those predicted by the impulsive model based on the small amplitude approximation. In the case of nominally flat interfaces, the thickness is observed to grow linearly at rates comparable to values previously reported...|$|R

The mathematical analysis shows that the customary theory for oblique 2 -dimensional wave interactions is equivalent to a 1 -dimensional Riemann problem for steady (supersonic) flow.

40|$|International audienceWhen a <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> crosses an <b>{{interface}}</b> {{between two}} materials, this interface becomes unstable and the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability develops. Such instability {{has been extensively}} studied in the planar case, and numerous results were presented during the previous workshops. But the Richtmyer-Meshkov (Richtmyer, 1960, ``Taylor Instability in Shock Acceleration of Compressible Fluids,'' Commun. Pure Appl. Math., 13 (2), pp. 297 - 319; Meshkov, 1969, ``Interface of Two Gases Accelerated by a Shock Wave,''Fluid Dyn., 4 (5), pp. 101 - 104) instability also occurs in a spherical case where the convergence effects {{must be taken into}} account. As far as we know, no conventional (straight section) shock tube facility has been used to experimentally study the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability in spherical geometry. The idea originally proposed by Dimotakis and Samtaney (2006,'' Planar Shock Cylindrical Focusing by a Perfect-Gas Lens,'' Phys. Fluid., 18 (3), pp. 031705 - 031708) and later generalized by Vandenboomgaerde and Aymard (2011, ``Analytical Theory for Planar Shock Focusing Through Perfect Gas Lens and Shock Tube Experiment Designs,'' Phys. Fluid., 23 (1), pp. 016101 - 016113) was to retain the flexibility of a conventional shock tube to convert a planar <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> into a cylindrical one through a perfect gas lens. This can be done when a planar <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> passes through a shaped interface between two gases. By coupling the shape with the impedance mismatch at the interface, it is possible to generate a circular transmitted <b>shock</b> <b>wave.</b> In order to experimentally check the feasibility of this approach, we have implemented the gas lens technique on a conventional shock tube {{with the help of a}} convergent test section, an elliptic stereolithographed grid, and a nitrocellulose membrane. First experimental sequences of schlieren images have been obtained for an incident <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> Mach number equal to 1. 15 and an air/SF 6 -shaped interface.

40|$|Mathematically, a <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> {{is treated}} as a {{discontinuity}} in a medium. In reality, however, a <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> is always structured, i. e., its front takes a finite time to rise from an initial material state to the final shocked state. The structuring of a shock front {{is due to the}} competition between the nonlinearity of material behavior and the dissipation processes occurring during the wave propagation. There are many mechanisms which may be responsible for the dissipation and/or dispersion of <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> energy. In homogeneous media, such as metals, one common interpretation for the structuring of a <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> is that the viscoplasticity processes (dislocation, twinning, etc.) are responsible for the dissipation of energy. While in heterogeneous composites, besides the viscous dissipative processes existing in each of its constituents, due to the existence of internal interfaces, the scattering induced by the interface during shock compression could be another important mechanism. In this study, the interface scattering effects on <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> propagation in heterogeneous media were investigated by subjecting periodically layered composites to planar impact loading with a flyer plate. The flyer plate was accelerated to a desired velocity using a powder gun loading system. In order to measure shock particle velocity time history at an internal or the free surface of the specimen, the so-called VISAR (Velocity Interferometry System for Any Reflector) diagnostic system was constructed and used during shock compression experiments. Manganin stress gages were embedded inside the specimen at selected internal interfaces to measure shock stress time history. To study the scattering mechanisms of the <b>interface</b> to <b>waves,</b> two-component composite specimens with different interface mechanical properties and heterogeneity were prepared and tested. Different types of composites were prepared with differing mechanical impedance. Specimens with different heterogeneity were obtained by changing the geometrical configuration (length scale) of the layered stack. Two-dimensional numerical simulations were also carried out to understand the process of <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> evolution in the layered composites. Experimental and numerical studies show that periodically layered composites support steady structured <b>shock</b> <b>waves.</b> The influence of internal <b>interfaces</b> on the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> propagation is through the scattering mechanism, i. e., multiple reflection of waves in the layers and their interaction with the <b>shock</b> <b>wave.</b> The <b>interface</b> scattering affects both the bulk and the deviatoric response of the composite to shock compression. The influence of scattering on the bulk behavior is to slow down the velocity of the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> in the composites, while its influence on the deviatoric response is to structure the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> profile. If all the dissipative and dispersive effects are collectively termed as viscosity, which causes the shock front structuring, i. e., the shock front rise-time increasing, then the effective shock viscosity increases with the increase of interface impedance mismatch and decreases with the increase of interface density (interface area per unit volume) and shock loading strength. The existing mixture model for constructing the constitutive relation for composites based on the known properties of its component materials can only, at best, reasonably predict the response of the composites under strong shock loading conditions. In order to fully describe the response of a heterogeneous composite to shock compression loading, accurate physics-based constitutive relations need to be formulated {{to take into account the}} scattering effects induced by the heterogeneous microstructure. ...|$|R

The CO line doubling returns over subsequent pulsation cycles, where the superposed line emission assumes its largest intensity near phases of maximum light. We find that the morphology and behavior of the CO band closely resemble the remarkable "line-splitting phenomenon" also observed in optical low-excitation atomic lines.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a third order {{accurate}} finite volume scheme based on polynomial reconstruction along with a posteriori limiting within an Adaptive-Mesh-Refinement (AMR) simulation code for hydro-dynamics equations in 2 D. The a posteriori limiting is based on the detection of problematic cells on a so-called candidate solution computed at each stage of a third order Runge-Kutta scheme. Such detection may include different properties, derived from physics, such as positivity, from numerics, such as a non-oscillatory behavior, or from computer requirements such as the absence of NaN's. Troubled cell values are discarded and re-computed starting again from the previous time-step using this time a more dissipating scheme but only locally to these cells. By decrementing the degree of the polynomial reconstructions from 2 to 0 we switch from a third-order to a first-order accurate scheme. Ultimately some troubled cells may be updated with a first order accurate scheme for instance close to steep gradients. The entropy indicator sensor is used to refine/coarsen the mesh. This sensor is also employed in an a posteriori manner because if some refinement is needed {{at the end of a}} time step, then the current time-step is recomputed but only locally with such refined mesh. We show on a large set of numerical tests that this a posteriori limiting procedure coupled with the entropy-based AMR technology not only can maintain optimal accuracy on smooth flows but also stability on discontinuous profiles such as <b>shock</b> <b>waves,</b> contacts, <b>interfaces,</b> etc. Moreover numerical evidences show that this approach is comparable in terms of accuracy and cost to a more classical CWENO approach within the same AMR context...|$|R

The development of the turbulent mixing is observed as a result of the shock-interface interaction. The flow is visualized using planar Mie scattering in which the light from a laser sheet is scattered by smoke particles seeded in one of the experimental gases and image sequences are captured using high-speed CMOS cameras.

As a result, it was clarified that countless underwater <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> were generated at the time of water plasma expansion by discharge. But, the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> was not confirmed at the time of after a second peak of the damping oscillation. It was clarified that one part of charging energy was used to generation of the <b>shock</b> <b>wave.</b> Therefore, it was clarified that to release energy by the critical oscillation is desirable for efficient generation of the <b>shock</b> <b>wave...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract – In {{acoustic}} <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> generators with focusing system {{such as a}} lens or reflector the nonli-near {{absorption of}} a spherical converging wave usually limits amplitude of a <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> in focus at a level 70 – 80 MPa. In the multi-beam electro-magnetic <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> generator, described in re-port, several weakly focused acoustic <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> propogate independenly and transverse only in the narrow region near the inersecton point of theirs spread directions. Because of small distance of syn-chronous <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> superposition the nonlinear absorption is negligible and we can achieve essential more high pressure amplitude in focal region then in traditional devices. Presented computer simula-tion of <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> propogation in linear approxi-mation is useful for choice the geometrical parame-ters of multi-beam <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> generator. Electro-mechanical simulation is used to analyse the coop-erative transition procesis in discharge cercuit and mechanical motion of metalic membrane in genera-tor. The role of cavitation on <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> propoga-tion in multi-beam generator is considered. Addi-tional advantages of multi-beam method of <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> localisation are discussed in connection with medical and biology applications. 1...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to investigate a pressure profile when a diffracted <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> interacts with a reflector from a safety point of view. Because the diffracted <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> are often generated by the explosions of combustible gases to cause serious damages against human race and surrounding buildings. The maximum pressure behind reflected <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> {{is one of the}} most important parameter and this report is concerned with the evaluation of maximum pressure, which might be a function of Mach number of the <b>shock</b> <b>wave,</b> distance from a source of the <b>shock</b> <b>wave,</b> initial pressure of the gas, and initial diameter of the <b>shock</b> <b>wave,</b> etc. In this study, a detonation-driven shock tube of 14 m long and 50 mm diameter is used to generate a strong <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> of propagating Mach number M_S= 3. 0 〜 5. 2. The <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> is diffracted from an open end of the shock tube of 25 mm diameter and reflected from a cylindrical reflector of 50 mm diameter. These phenomena are observed using color-schlieren optical techniques and the pressure histories at the stagnation point of the reflector are simultaneously measured. As a result, (i) The behaviors of the diffracted <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> and complicate flow-fields behind reflected <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> are observed. (ii) An empirical equation to calculate the maximum pressure behind reflected <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> is estimated by the results of experimental and numerical simulation...|$|R

The prompt convection model states that the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> will increase the luminosity of the neutrinos produced by the core collapse, and this increase in energy will start the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> going again. The neutron fingers model has instability near the core expel another wave of energized neutrinos which reenergizes the <b>shock</b> <b>wave.</b> The entropy convection model has matter falling inward from above the shock layer down to the gain radius, which would not increase neutrino luminosity, but would allow the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> to continue outwards.|$|R
