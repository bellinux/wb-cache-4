60|$|She {{supposed}} that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>let</b> him see too clearly her weariness of {{this side of}} life.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>let</b> {{him have}} her hand somehow, {{and he was}} keeping it; but they had both risen.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what will}} you do with your {{students}} who are married already?" [...] his wife said. She felt that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>let</b> him go on long enough.|$|E
5000|$|Our {{lady that}} went to be married, Did not move us with her. She did not move us with her, But in the end <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>let</b> us come. (Waley 1937: 74) ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{promises}} to remember it. His arm tries to wind round her once more. No! She is mistress of herself; she can positively dismiss him now--after <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>let</b> him kiss her! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{have seemed}} lukewarm {{sometimes}} of late," [...] Brott said, [...] "there is the cause. She is an aristocrat, and my politics are hateful to her. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> {{told me so}} seriously, playfully, angrily. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>let</b> me feel it in a hundred ways. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> drawn me into discussions and shown the utmost horror of my views. I have cared for her all my life, and she knows it. And I think, Grahame, that lately <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been trying constantly, persistently, to tone down my opinions. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>let</b> me understand {{that they are a}} bar between us. And it is a horrible confession, Grahame, but I believe that I was wavering. This invitation from Letheringham seemed such a wonderful opportunity for compromise." ...|$|R
60|$|Passively Mary {{submitted}} to the woman's ministrations, and presently felt soothed, as Margot with, by no means ungentle hands, brushed steadily the long hair <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>let</b> down.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>let</b> him go on alone. But, in the chaos, she {{had worked}} by his side again. And out of the chaos, she had fled with him to London.|$|E
6000|$|... "How should I know?" [...] {{returned}} Cornelia. She {{thought it}} rather odd he should recur to that after <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>let</b> him see {{she did not}} want to talk about Charmian's art.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{disappoint}} me, Cavaliere," [...] said Rowland, solemnly. [...] "I imagined you {{appreciated the}} great elevation of Miss Light's attitude. She {{does n't love}} the prince; <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>let</b> the matter stand or fall by that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take it and comb it, mistress, as {{you used}} to do. Comb out the golden locks again, fit to shine across the battle-field. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>let</b> them get all tangled into elf-knots, that lazy slut within." ...|$|R
50|$|In the song, Shakira {{explains}} the sadness {{that she feels}} after a broken relationship and how <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>let</b> herself go, while she continues {{to wait for him}} to come back. It was a single only for radio, no video was shot for the song.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think anything's queer but you!" [...] Delia had retorted; and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>let</b> {{her father}} {{know that she}} had left Francie in {{the very act of}} [...] "handling" [...] Mr. Flack.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{better for}} your future peace. I honour her. If <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>let</b> the Welsh dragon show {{his teeth in}} style, he would only have had to make {{unpleasant}} apologies when the good time comes.' ...|$|E
60|$|Allie's legs {{began to}} grow weak under her. The strain, the suspense, the longing grew {{to be too much}} for her and occasioned a revulsion of feeling. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>let</b> her hopes carry her too high.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{mean your}} neighbour, Mistress Nelly," [...] said her worthy helpmate; [...] "but Kate, her date is out. Wit <b>she</b> <b>has,</b> <b>let</b> her keep herself warm {{with it in}} worse company, for the cant of a gang of {{strollers}} is not language for a prince's chamber."[*] ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was all so}} understandable--looked at in {{the proper}} light. It was all so {{impossible}} to explain. And why <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>let</b> it happen? Why <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>let</b> it happen? ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Ramsey, with {{starting}} tears: [...] "It doesn't matter now." [...] <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>let</b> {{her lovely}} length trail {{into the corner}} of the sofa, where she desperately reclines, supporting her elbow on the arm of it, and resting her drooping head on her hand. He draws a hassock up in front of her, and sits on it.|$|R
6000|$|Renouard and Miss Moorsom {{emerged from}} the shadows side by side, a well-matched couple, {{animated}} yet statuesque in their calmness and in their pallor. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>let</b> go his wrist. On catching sight of Renouard the Editor exclaimed: ...|$|E
60|$|After <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>let</b> them in, {{and brought}} them into the parlour, she came up to Amy and I, who were hardly out of the fright, and yet were congratulating one another that Amy was not {{surprised}} again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Annie, {{and with}} a thrill of dismay she asked herself how much <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>let</b> her manner betray that she had {{supposed}} he was a book agent. [...] "I shall be very glad indeed, Mr. Brandreth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it is {{very odd}} that <b>she</b> should <b>have</b> <b>let</b> you learn to ride, which one would <b>have</b> thought <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> dreaded most of all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had hardly}} any {{alternative}} as the things went. <b>She</b> would <b>have</b> been quite {{welcome to the}} horse if <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> <b>let</b> me alone afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{her home}} to bed," [...] the doctor interrupted, [...] "and you'll find she'll sleep it off. <b>She</b> seems to <b>have</b> a splendid constitution, {{although}} <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>let</b> herself run down. If you need any further advice and your own medical man is not available, I will come and see her if you send for me. Camden, my name is; telephone number 734 Gerrard." ...|$|R
6000|$|She had not moved; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>let</b> me take my {{hand from}} her own with as little sign as on her first feeling its touch. She only kept her eyes on me. [...] "What made {{you have such a}} fancy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Her {{explanation}} was airy; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>let</b> the thing {{slip out of}} her mind for a time. But there were various debts to Oxbridge tradespeople. How much? Well, rather a lot. Of course, the tradespeople were rather enticing when first one went up----How much, anyhow? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After all, you know, you {{are better}} off than if you were still at school; and the M.A. is a good old soul at the bottom, and you may manage her, depend on it. Though I wish <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>let</b> me go to Girton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the square}} below," [...] said the Happy Prince, [...] "there stands a little match-girl. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>let</b> her matches {{fall in the}} gutter, {{and they are all}} spoiled. Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money, and she is crying. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare. Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will not beat her." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jin left Mediacorp in February 2017, {{after her}} {{contract}} expired, following a 30 year career in show business. However, Jin was not shown any respect during contract talks since January 2016. She was allegedly told {{to take a}} pay cut and was compared to a [...] "$50-an-hour bit player." [...] Since then, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>let</b> it go and would take any acting opportunities in the future.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear lady," [...] Strether replied--and {{he had it}} even {{to himself}} {{surprisingly}} ready--"my dear lady, his mother has paid HIM a visit. Mrs. Newsome has been with him, this month, with an intensity that I'm sure he has thoroughly felt; he has lavishly entertained her, and <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>let</b> him <b>have</b> her thanks. Do you suggest he shall go back for more of them?" ...|$|R
60|$|He sat in silence. He {{was full}} of a feeling that she had deceived him. She had despised him when he thought she worshipped him. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>let</b> him say wrong things, and had not contradicted him. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>let</b> him fight alone. But it stuck in his throat that she had despised him whilst he thought she worshipped him. She should have told him when she found fault with him. She had not played fair. He hated her. All these years she had treated {{him as if he}} were a hero, and thought of him {{secretly}} as an infant, a foolish child. Then why had she left the foolish child to his folly? His heart was hard against her.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{has made}} a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and the dear little soul shall have a jolly time {{in spite of her}} fuss and feathers. But I do wish <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>let</b> her hair alone and worn that pretty hat of hers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't move, don't go," [...] {{she begged}} of him, when he stooped {{to gather the}} papers <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>let</b> fall. But he took them in his hands and, giving her by a sudden impulse his own {{unfinished}} dissertation, with its mystical conclusion, they read each other's compositions in silence.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am sure {{my mother}} wouldn't wish {{me to have}} {{anything}} to do with her. I don't think <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> <b>let</b> me come here if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> known what sort of girl she is.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, truly," [...] {{said the}} first speaker, [...] "our cousin Edith must first learn how this vaunted wight hath {{conducted}} himself, and we must reserve the power of giving her ocular proof that he hath failed in his duty. It may be a lesson will do good upon her; for, credit me, Calista, I <b>have</b> sometimes thought <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>let</b> this Northern adventurer sit nearer her heart than prudence would sanction." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am so glad; but <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> <b>let</b> me know,' said Cousin Maria, looking {{round the}} {{conservatory}} {{as if to}} see if the plants were all there.|$|R
