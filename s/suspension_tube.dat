40|$|The {{experimental}} {{formation of}} natural gas hydrate on pendant water droplet exposed to natural gas was conducted and visually observed under the pressures from 3. 86 MPa to 6. 05 MPa. The temperature was set at 274. 75 K and 273. 35 K. The diameter of the pendant water droplet was around 4 mm. The nucleation and growth of hydrate film on the pendant water drop exhibited a generalized trend. The film initially generated at {{the boundary between the}} water drop and <b>suspension</b> <b>tube,</b> and afterwards grew laterally and longitudinally {{on the surface of the}} water drop. The phenomenon of the two layers of hydrate films growing on the pendant water drop distinguished from the experiments on the sessile water drop. The effect of the driving force that resulted from the overpressure from the three equilibrium pressure on the hydrate nucleation and growth was investigated. It was found that the elevation of the driving force reduced the nucleation time and shortened the process of the hydrate growth on the pendant water drop. The crystals on the hydrate shell became coarser with the increase of the driving force. The mechanism for the hydrate film formation and growth on static pedant water droplet included four stages, such as nucleation, generation of the hydrate film, growth of the hydrate film, and hydration below the hydrate shell...|$|E
40|$|Background: The main {{aspect of}} concern for upper GI {{procedures}} has been the retraction of the liver especially large left lobes as commonly encountered in Bariatric surgery. Not doing so would compromise {{the view of the}} hiatus, hence theoretically reducing the quality of the surgery and increasing the possibility of complications. The aim {{of this study was to}} review the various liver retraction techniques in single incision surgery being done at our institute and analyze them. Material and Methods: A retrospective study of the various techniques and a subsequent analysis was made based on advantages and disadvantages of each method. Objectively a quantitative measure of hiatal exposure was done using a scoring system based on the grade of exposure after reviewing the surgical videos. From January 2011 to January 2013 total 104 patients underwent single incision surgery with the various liver retraction techniques with following grades of exposure -liver <b>suspension</b> <b>tube</b> technique with naso gastric tubing (2. 11) and with corrugated drain (2. 09) needlescopic method (1. 2), Umbilical tape sling (1. 95), crural stitch method (2. 5). Needeloscopic method has the best grade of exposure and is the easiest to start with. The average time to create the liver retraction was 2. 8 to 8. 6 min. There was no procedure related morbidity or mortality. Conclusions: The mentioned liver retraction techniques are cost effective and easy to learn. We recommend using these techniques to have a good exposure of hiatus, without compromising the safety of surgery in single incision surgery...|$|E

40|$|Strongyloidiasis is {{prevalent}} in Thailand, yet its prevalence {{in the south}} is lower than {{in other parts of}} the country. This might be due to the long rainy season in the south resulting in stool submersion in water inhibiting worm development. In this study, the effect of water submersion of fecal samples on development of Strongyloides stercoralis was investigated. Ten ml of a 1 ∶ 5 fecal suspension were placed in 15 -ml tubes, 35 -mm dishes, and 90 -mm dishes producing the depths of 80 mm, 11 mm and 2 mm-suspensions, respectively. The worm development was followed at 1 / 6, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 24, and 36 h, by determining the number of filariform larva (FL) generated from agar-plate cultures (APC). Fecal <b>suspensions</b> kept in <b>tubes</b> and 35 -mm dishes showed a decline in FL yield relative to incubation time and reached zero production 14 h after incubation. In contrast, the number of FL generated from the suspension kept in 90 -mm dishes remained stable up to 36 h. Cumulatively, all tubes and 35 -mm dishes became negative in APC after 14 h while 90 -mm dishes remained APC-positive up to 36 h. Adding more water or stool suspension to dishes resulted in a decreased number of FL. Mechanical aeration of the <b>suspensions</b> in <b>tubes</b> restored an almost normal FL yield.

The book presents the fundamentals under which processes of solid-liquid separation are studied, approaching mixtures of discrete finely divided solid particles in water as a basis for dealing with sedimentation in particulate systems. Suspensions, treated as continuous media, provide the basis of sedimentation, flows through porous media and filtration.

The inoculum consisted of 0. 1 ml. of the bacterial <b>suspension</b> per <b>tube</b> of broth. This gave a final concentration of 99 micrograms per ml. The results of such experiments showed no effect of the inhibitor {{at any of the}} three pH values studied. Mirsky 26 found that crude preparations of pancreatic trypsin-inhibitor, like the crystalline compound, inhibited bacterial growth in concentrations of 1 to 5 per cent. The crude soybean product gave uniformly negative results. It has been suggested that the differences between the virulence and the pH {{tolerance of}} bacteria are associated with enzymes which differ quantitatively or qualitatively in the bacterial cell. Evidence in support of this hypothesis was obtained by growing virulent and avirulent strains of B. anthracis in broth, serum, and in the presence of trypsin and trypsin-inhibitor. To determine directly whether or not the postulated trypsin-like enzymes were actually present, cultures of virulent and avirulent strains of B. anthracis were tested for their ability to produce proteolytic enzymes.

40|$|In this work, an {{experimental}} method is developed {{to study the}} effects of particle size, flow rate, pulsation, particle/substrate material, and temperature on the short-term reentrainment of submicron particles. The particles tested are in the size range of 10 - 900 nm and are deposited by wetting the inside of capillary tubes with a liquid <b>suspension.</b> The <b>tubes</b> are then dried in a desiccator. The particles are reentrained under turbulent dry air flow conditions and a condensation particle counter is used to measure the number of entrained particles. There has been very limited work done with nanoscale particles in general and no previous experimental work has reported about this particular parameter set. In order to interpret the data, a bimodal lognormal probability density for the ratio of adhesion force to removal forces is suggested. The majority of particles is attached to the surface by strong forces and cannot be entrained. However, a small fraction of particles, called loose particles, is attached to the surface by much smaller forces. Based on experimental data, an analytical equation for the fraction of loose particles in terms of a dimensionless force is developed. This dimensionless force is a function of particle size and gas flow rate. The temporal variations of fraction of deposited particles are calculated by incorporating the fraction of loose particles with the model of Wen and Kasper (1989). The experimental data confirmed the theoretical expectation that entrainment strongly depends on particle size and decreases as the size of the particle decreases. Both higher flow rates and pulsation of the flow increase the entrainment. Pulsation causes the distribution of forces to broaden. It is shown that the effect of particle/substrate material on entrainment can be predicted by the compound Hamaker constant provided that the morphology and the roughness of the system remain the same. Otherwise, the effect of roughness or morphology may override the effect of Hamaker constant...|$|R

The method is based on repeated infiltration of precursor solution into macroporous silicon (Si) templates at a sub-atmospheric pressure. Prior to crystallization at 750 °C, free-standing tubes of a 2 -μm outer diameter, extending to over 30 μm in length were released from the Si template using a selective isotropic-pulsed XeF 2 reactive ion etching. To facilitate rapid electrical characterization and enable future integration process, directed positioning and aligning of the PZT tubes was performed by dielectrophoresis. The electric field-assisted technique involves an alternating electric voltage that is applied through pre-patterned microelectrodes to a colloidal <b>suspension</b> of PZT <b>tubes</b> dispersed in isopropyl alcohol. The most efficient biasing for the assembly of tubes across the electrode gap of 12 μm was a square wave signal of 5 Vrms and 10 Hz. By varying the applied frequency in between 1 and 10 Hz, an enhancement in tube alignment was obtained...|$|R
