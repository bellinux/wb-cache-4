In {{this type of}} development, the hymenium forms early {{on the underside of}} the cap and upper stem of the mushroom primordium. As the cap enlarges, the margin, made of flaring filamentous hyphae that grow outward and downward, tends to curve inward, eventually forming a flap of tissue roughly parallel to the stem surface. As further development takes place, these hyphae make contact with and adhere to the hymenial surface of the stem, covering basidia and macrocystidia (very long cystidia) already present.

The South Mayo Trough in western Ireland preserves a complete and well-dated sedimentary record of arc collision. We sampled sandstones and conglomerates from the Rosroe, Maumtrasna and Derryveeny Formations in order to assess erosion rates and patterns during and after arc collision. U–Pb dating of zircons reveals a provenance dominated by erosion from the upper levels of the Dalradian Supergroup (Southern Highland and Argyll Groups), with up to 20 % influx from the colliding arc into the Rosroe Formation, but only 6 % in the Maumtrasna Formation (~ 465 Ma). The dominant source regions lay to the northeast (e. g. {{in the vicinity of the}} Ox Mountains, 50 km distant, along strike). The older portions of the North Mayo Dalradian and its depositional basement (the Annagh Gneiss Complex) do not appear to have been important sources, while the Connemara Dalradian only plays a part after 460 Ma, when it supplies the Derryveeny Formation. By this time all erosion from the arc had effectively ceased and exhumation rates had slowed greatly. The Irish Grampian Orogeny parallels the modern Taiwan collision in showing little role for the colliding arc in the production of sediment.

The characterization of organic matter indudes the determination of buk parameters (hydrogen index values and C/N ratios) and the analysis of specific biomarkers (n-alaknes, fatty acids, alkenones, and pigments). Total organic carbon (TOC) values vary between 0. 3 and 2 %. In general, the organic matter from the Laptev Sea continental margin is dominated by terrigenous matter throughout. However. significant amounts of marine organic carbon occur. The turbidites, according to a still preliminary stratigraphy probably deposited during glacial Oxygen Isotope Stages 2 and 4, are characterized by maximum amounts of organic carbon of terrigenous origin. Marine organic carbon appears to show enhanced relative abundances in the Termination I (?) and early Holocene time intervals, as indicated by maximum amounts of short chain n-alkanes, short-chain fatty acids, and alkenones. The increased amounts of faity acids, however, may also have a freshwater origin due to increased river discharge at that time.

40|$|A {{regional}} {{three-dimensional model}} has been constructed for the lithospheric structure of the NE Atlantic <b>margin.</b> <b>Starting</b> from the known bathymetry and an initial sediment thickness estimate and making allowance for thermal effects, the geometry of the crystalline crust was predicted using isostatic and flexural principles. Optimization methods were then used to modify the base sediment and Moho interfaces to improve the fit between observed and calculated gravity anomalies. The method provides new insights into basin morphology and into variations in the thickness of both crystalline continental crust and igneous oceanic crust. When combined with imaging of the gravity and magnetic fields, the model {{highlights the importance of}} broadly NW-trending lineaments on the development of post-Caledonian basin architecture. In some cases these lineaments are interpreted as pre-Caledonian structures that were reactivated as transfer zones during phases of Mesozoic extension. Some of the lineaments appear to have influenced the early evolution of the oceanic crust by providing the precursors to transform offsets and possibly also by affecting the pattern of asthenospheric flow. The crustal thickening of the Faroe–Iceland Ridge is clearly imaged and its geometry is interpreted to reflect temporal variations in the enhanced oceanic crustal production rate responsible for this feature, including a Late Eocene minimum which can be correlated with plate reorganization in the north Atlantic region. There is some evidence of Cenozoic deformation linked to transpressive reactivation of the lineaments. However, a deflection in the axis of the North Hatton Anticline across the NW-trending Anton Dohrn lineament is {{more likely to have been}} inherited from an offset in an underlying, reactivated basement structure than to have resulted from strike-slip movements at the time of folding. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{search for}} less {{invasive}} treatments, with fast and effective bone regeneration, has {{lead to the}} development of synthetic bioresorbable alternatives for bone graft. The commercial product FisiograftTM gel (Ghimas Spa, Italy), based on lactide-glycolide copolymer, is used as an injectable biocompatible and bioresorbable material for filling bone defects in dental surgery applications. These polymers are also used in the production of suture threads, pins and plates for bone fixation, and barriers for guided tissue regeneration. Objective: The main objective of this pilot study was to observe the initial bone healing response after the application of polylactide-glycolide graft material in adult animals. Material and methods: Bone defects were prepared in right and left femora of 12 month-old male Wistar rats. The defects in one leg received the synthetic graft material and the contra-lateral defects did not receive any treatment. After four days, the animals were subjected to euthanasia, the femora were removed, and tissue blocks were prepared for histological analysis. Results: Blood clot remained in the centre of control defects with initial connective tissue organization on the edges. The graft material was observed in the centre of the treated defects, restricted to the area where it was applied, with neovascularization next to the graft material. The pattern of bone healing did not differ between groups, <b>starting</b> from the <b>margins</b> of the defects and from bone fragments, with neovascularization followed by deposition of non-mineralized bone matrix towards the centre. Conclusion: The results indicate that the lactide-glycolide copolymer gel was effective as a filling and osteoconductive material, allowing tissue healing during its resorption process. Additional studies are necessary to verify its capacity to promote bone regeneration...|$|R
