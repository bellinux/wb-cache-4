40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA travelling wave tube {{for the study}} of high intensity acoustics has been constructed. The tube has inner diameter two inches and length 70 feet, and consists of seven 10 foot long sections smoothly joined by collars and flanges. Attached to one end is a housing that contains two JBL horn drivers connected to the tube by a "Y" adapter. An anechoic end termination spans the length of the last <b>section.</b> The <b>termination</b> is made of steel wool of tapered density distribution. Pulse reflection measurements yielded an absorption of 40 dB or greater for frequencies of 500 Hz and higher. Reflected signals of the junctions were typically 40 dB down. Linear attenuation measurements indicated no appreciable acoustic losses at the junctions. Sum, difference and second harmonic generation measurements revealed that interactions were occurring in the medium of interest (air) and were not the result of the drivers or intermodulations of the two drivers. The performance under these preliminary tests indicates that the apparatus is suitable for nonlinear acoustics investigations. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|Technical standards, which enable {{products}} {{manufactured by}} different vendors to work together, {{form the basis of}} the modem technological infrastructure. Yet an obscure provision of the U. S. Copyright Act, enacted to allow authors and composers to profit from the later success of their works, now threatens to disrupt this critical technological ecosystem. Enacted in 1976, Section 203 of the Copyright Act permits the author of a copyrighted work to revoke any copyright license or assignment between thirty-five and forty years after the grant was made. For grants made in 1978, the first year to which <b>Section</b> 203 applies, <b>terminations</b> could first be made in 2013, and in the music and publishing industries such terminations, and the concomitant litigation, have already begun. Technical standards are also treated as copyrightable works, and arguably the provisions of Section 203 apply to them. Numerous standards published in 1978 are still in use, and each year the number of standards potentially subject to <b>Section</b> 203 <b>termination</b> will grow. But unlike the composers and authors whom Section 203 was intended to protect, contributors to technical standards are usually engineers employed by large corporations, research institutions, or government agencies who make such contributions without additional compensation. Standards are thus unburdened by the copyright royalty obligations that characterize musical compositions, books, and other works of authorship. The termination of customary royalty-free copyright licenses granted by contributors to standards organizations or their heirs could thus have a significant disruptive effect on the standardization process and impose a substantial new cost on industries that are standards-dependent (a cost most likely to be passed through to consumers). The application of Section 203 to technical standards, however, is not straightforward. This article, for the first time, assesses Section 203 in terms of its applicability to technical standards documents. In particular, it analyzes considerations of joint authorship, works-made-for-hire, and derivative works under Section 203 to an area that was clearly not contemplated by Congress when it enacted the statute. We conclude that, although Section 203 is theoretically applicable to technical standards, several statutory obstacles would impede the wholesale termination of standards-related license grants. Nevertheless, in order to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation, we recommend that Congress or the courts explicitly acknowledge the inapplicability of Section 203 to technical standards...|$|R
40|$|We {{set out to}} {{evaluate}} the safety and efficacy of the proposed misoprostol regimen in women with previous multiple caesarean sections. This was a retrospective cohort study of 21 women {{with more than one}} caesarean <b>section</b> who underwent <b>termination</b> of pregnancy (TOP) with 400 mu g of vaginal misoprostol followed by 200 mu g/ 6 h (max 800 mu g).

In the first trimester group, only 3 / 9 (33. 34 %) aborted completely, while (9 / 12) 75 % second trimester patients aborted completely. There were no major complications. The proposed regimen is considered safe and reasonably effective in second trimester TOPs in women with previous multiple caesarean sections. In first trimester patients, the possibility of manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) should be discussed during counselling, or a higher dose should be used as the effectiveness is low...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{pathogenic}} {{involvement of}} granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in arthritis {{has been put}} forward. We have investigated the therapeutic effect of GM-CSF neutralisation in the streptococcal cell wall (SCW) arthritis model in mice. In this model, the pathogenic contribution of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha is minor and is expressed only on joint swelling, whereas cartilage proteoglycan depletion is independent of this cytokine. METHODS: Acute monarthritis was induced by injection of SCW bacterial extracts to mouse knees. Treatments (mAb 22 E 9 at 300, 100, 30 microg; or Enbrel 300 microg) were given twice intraperitoneally 2 h before and 3 days after disease induction. Swelling was assessed by (99 m) Tc uptake into knees on days 1 and 2. Local cytokine levels were determined in patellae washouts on day one. Proteoglycan loss from cartilage was scored on histological <b>sections</b> at <b>termination</b> on day four. RESULTS: Treatment with anti-GM-CSF mAb 22 E 9 showed a dose-related efficacy by decreasing swelling that was significant at the 300 and 100 microg doses in comparison to isotype control, and comparable to dexamethasone (5 mg/ml). Proteoglycan loss from cartilage was also significantly reduced by mAb 22 E 9 300 microg (p= 0. 001). This reduced proteoglycan loss observed after GM-CSF neutralisation was not seen after TNFalpha-blockade with Enbrel. Similarly, levels of interleukin 1 beta in joints were reduced after treatment with 22 E 9 mAb (p= 0. 003) but not in mice receiving Enbrel. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a pathogenic role for GM-CSF in this arthritis model, support the therapeutic potential of neutralising this cytokine, and may indicate therapeutic activity of an anti-GM-CSF mAb in TNFalpha-independent disease situations...|$|R

40|$|A {{sinkhole}} measuring 40 m {{in diameter}} and up to 6. 5 m deep occurs within the Nachusa Grasslands, {{near the town of}} Franklin Grove, northwestern Illinois. This area, dedicated to prairie conservation and restoration, is owned and operated by The Nature Conservancy. Several meters of unconsolidated sand, gravel, and clay overlie the St. Peter sandstone, beneath which lies karstic Prairie du Chien dolomite. Investigations included EM conductivity profiles, resistivity soundings, 2 D resistivity, and ground- penetrating radar (GPR), supplemented by conductivity logs, soil cores, and tree core studies. These data indicate the sandstone averages about 5 m deep near the sinkhole rim and the sinkhole is about 120 years old. Nearby residential wells indicate an average static water level of 11 m below the surface, so the water table currently lies well below the sinkhole floor. GPR <b>sections</b> show abrupt <b>termination</b> of the bedrock reflector near the sinkhole rim, suggesting formation by collapse. Geophysical investigations also identified possible hydraulic conduits associated with the sinkhole. Specifically, GPR profiles, at 50 and 100 MHz, provide the highest resolution images of the subsurface and indicate possible conduits (soil pipes) near the sinkhole rim as diffraction hyperbolas 2 - 3 m below the surface. GeoProbeTM conductivity logs showing unusually low conductivity, and sudden probe drops, also suggest the presence of shallow soil cavities around the sinkhole. However, dye poured into various low spots on the sinkhole floor was never recovered, despite numerous sampling locations...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Despite {{the declining}} trend of {{maternal}} mortality (MMR) in Iran between 1990 and 2013, direct causes {{are still the}} major reasons for maternal death. One of these direct causes is complications of cesarean section (CS). Since the rate of CS in Iran is quite high (47. 9 %) and the trend continues to rise, there is an alarming threat {{of the possibility of}} increasing MMR in the country as a result of cesarean section complications, especially in repeated cases. In this study, we attempted to determine the indications of CS in reported maternal mortality, with special attention to risk factors predisposing to CS and/or to maternal mortality. Materials and methods: A retrospective study was implemented for the period between March 2009 and March 2012. All nationally reported data regarding maternal death during pregnancy, labor and 42 days after parturition during these 3 years was collected and input to software specially designed for this project. Subsequently, cases of maternal death related to pregnancy <b>termination</b> by cesarean <b>section</b> were selected for analysis. Results: There were 393 cases of maternal death with cesarean <b>section</b> as the <b>termination</b> method. Indications of CS were mostly emergency and repeat and the leading causes of death were postpartum hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders. Most of these deaths occurred in academic hospitals and {{the most common type of}} delay was brought about by hospital management, specifically personnel issues. Conclusion: Based on this study, acknowledging CS as a serious health threat endangering every achievement in the maternal health program is the most important policy and efforts should be focused on provision of guidelines for realistic CS indications, standardized CS procedures, and post CS care as well as propagation of training courses in risk management and high risk case-finding protocols. </div...|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{statistically}} evaluate the hypothesis that the presence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid is associated with postpartum maternal infection. Methods: This prospective cohort study included 573 term pregnant women in labor, with no other medical problems, that underwent cesarean <b>section</b> for pregnancy <b>termination.</b> Women with prolonged active-phase labor, prolonged rupture of membranes, complicated cesarean section and pre-operative infections were excluded from this study. The subjects were divided into two groups: 280 women with meconium-stained amniotic fluid (M group), and 293 women with clear amniotic fluid (C group). A comparison was done regarding postpartum fever, endometritis and wound infection between the two groups. Students t-test and chi square test were used for data analysis, along with linear regression, with p< 0. 05 indicating significance. Results: Among the 573 women, a total of 82 women (14 %) had fever after cesarean; 42 women from the M group, and 40 women from the C group (p= 0. 3). Among the 82 women who had fever, 33 women had continuous fever, 6. 5 % in group M and 2. 7 % in group C (p< 0. 05, RR: 1. 98, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 3. 1).
