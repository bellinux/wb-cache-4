The first solid-state laser, invented in 1960, was pumped by a xenon flash lamp, and lasers used to power inertial confinement fusion are also pumped by xenon flash lamps.|$|E
5|$|The nerve {{receives}} {{close attention}} from surgeons since during neck surgery, especially thyroid and parathyroid surgery, the nerve {{is at risk}} for injury. Nerve damage can be assessed by laryngoscopy, during which a <b>stroboscopic</b> light confirms the absence of movement in the affected side of the vocal cords. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve is more susceptible to damage during thyroid surgery because it {{is close to the}} bifurcation of the right inferior thyroid artery, variably passing in front of, behind, or between the branches. The nerve is permanently damaged in 0.33% of thyroid surgery, and transiently in 38% of surgeries, {{and is one of the}} leading causes of medicolegal issues for surgeons.|$|E

25|$|An {{earthenware}} bowl from Iran, over 5000 years old, {{could be}} considered a predecessor of the zoetrope. This bowl is decorated in a series of images portraying a goat jumping toward a tree and eating its leaves. The images are sequential and seem evenly distributed around the bowl, but the bowl would have to rotate quite fast and steady while a <b>stroboscopic</b> effect is needed for the images to appear as an animation. It remains very uncertain if the artist who created the bowl actually intended to create an animation.|$|E
25|$|Frame rate: High frame rates (i.e. images {{acquired}} per second) {{are needed}} to visualize fast motion without <b>stroboscopic</b> effects. However, the higher the frame rate, the higher the radiation dose. Therefore, the frame rate should be chosen according to the clinical need and be as low as reasonably possible. For example, in pediatric cardiology, frame rates of 60 pulses per second are required compared to 0.5 p/s for slowly moving objects. A reduction to half pulse rate reduces dose by about half. The reduction from 30 p/s to 7.5 p/s results in a dose saving of 75%.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the most}} {{accurate}} tuning devices, strobe tuners work differently than regular electronic tuners. They are stroboscopes that flicker a light at the same frequency as the note. The light shines on a wheel that spins at a precise speed. The interaction of the light and regularly-spaced marks on the wheel creates a <b>stroboscopic</b> effect that makes the marks for a particular pitch appear to stand still when the pitch is in tune. These can tune instruments and audio devices more accurately than most non-strobe tuners. However, mechanical strobe units are expensive and delicate, and their moving parts require periodic servicing, so they are used mainly in applications that require higher precision, such as by professional instrument makers and repair experts.|$|E
25|$|Iwai {{was born}} in Kira, Aichi, Japan. As a child, he spent time {{creating}} flip book-style animations {{in the corner of}} text books and making motor-driven mechanical toys, since these were the only technologies available to him. In 1981 Iwai matriculated in the Fine Arts Department at the University of Tsukuba, studying Plastic Art and Mixed Media. Influenced by the work of Norman McLaren, he began producing installation art that combined pre-cinema animation techniques (the phenakistoscope and the zoetrope) with modern methods of image capture and creation (photocopiers, video cameras and computer graphics) and of <b>stroboscopic</b> lighting (video monitors, video projectors and LEDs). His 1985 installation Time Stratum won the Gold prize at the High Technology Art Exhibition '85, held in Shibuya Seibu, Tokyo. Time Stratum II was awarded the Grand Prize at the 17th Contemporary Japanese Art Exhibition, Meguro Art Museum, Tokyo. In 1987 Iwai graduated from the University of Tsukuba with a master's degree in Plastic Art and Mixed Media. In the same year, Iwai designed his first published videogame, Otocky, in association with ASCII Corporation.|$|E
25|$|This disc rotates {{at a fixed}} {{specific}} speed, set by the user. Each disc {{rotation speed}} is set to a particular frequency of the desired note. If the note being played (and making the lamps behind the disc flash) is {{at exactly the same}} frequency as the spinning of the disc, then the disc appears to be static (due to the persistence of vision) from the strobing effect. If the note is out of tune then the pattern appears to be moving as the light flashing and the disc rotation are out of sync from each other. The more out of tune the played note is, the faster the pattern seems to be moving, although in reality it always spins at the same speed for a given note. Many good turntables for vinyl disc records have <b>stroboscopic</b> patterns lit by the incoming AC power (mains). The power frequency, either 50 or 60Hz, serves as the reference, although commercial power frequency sometimes changes slightly (a few tenths of a percent) with varying load. Unless reference and measured quantity are interchanged, the operating principle is the same; the turntable speed is adjusted to stop drifting of the pattern.|$|E

2500|$|... "In 1912... {{the idea}} of {{describing}} the movement of a nude coming downstairs while still retaining static visual means to do this, particularly interested me.

2500|$|Electronic {{ballasts}} usually {{supply power}} to the lamp at a frequency of [...] or higher, rather than the mains frequency of this substantially eliminates the <b>stroboscopic</b> effect of flicker, {{a product of the}} line frequency associated with fluorescent lighting (see photosensitive epilepsy). The high output frequency of an electronic ballast refreshes the phosphors in a fluorescent lamp so rapidly that there is no perceptible flicker. The flicker index, used for measuring perceptible light modulation, has a range from 0.00 to 1.00, with 0 indicating the lowest possibility of flickering and 1 indicating the highest. Lamps operated on magnetic ballasts have a flicker index between 0.04–0.07 while digital ballasts have a flicker index of below 0.01.|$|E
2500|$|From 1989 to 2007 Woodard built {{replicas of}} the Dreamachine, a <b>stroboscopic</b> {{contrivance}} devised by Brion Gysin and Ian Sommerville that involves a slotted cylinder, made of copper or paper, rotating about an electrical lamp—when observed with closed eyes the machine can trigger mental aberrations comparable to drug intoxication or dreaming. After contributing a Dreamachine to William S. Burroughs' 1996 LACMA visual retrospective Ports of Entry, Woodard befriended the author and presented him with a [...] "Bohemian model" [...] (paper) Dreamachine for his 83rd and final birthday.

2500|$|Strobe tuners (the popular {{term for}} <b>stroboscopic</b> tuners) {{are the most}} {{accurate}} type of tuner. There are three types of strobe tuners: the mechanical rotating disk strobe tuner, an LED array strobe {{in place of the}} rotating disk, and [...] "virtual strobe" [...] tuners with LCDs or ones that work on personal computers. A strobe tuner shows the difference between a reference frequency and the musical note being played. Even the slightest difference between the two shows up as a rotating motion in the strobe display. The accuracy of the tuner is only limited by the internal frequency generator. The strobe tuner detects the pitch either from a TRS input jack or a built-in or external microphone connected to the tuner.|$|E
2500|$|Fluorescent lamps using a {{magnetic}} power line frequency ballast {{do not give}} out a steady light; instead, they flicker at twice the supply frequency. This results in fluctuations not only with light output but color temperature as well, which may pose problems for photography {{and people who are}} sensitive to the flicker. Even among persons not sensitive to light flicker, a <b>stroboscopic</b> effect can be noticed, where something spinning at just the right speed may appear stationary if illuminated solely by a single fluorescent lamp. This effect is eliminated by paired lamps operating on a lead-lag ballast. Unlike a true strobe lamp, the light level drops in appreciable time and so substantial [...] "blurring" [...] of the moving part would be evident.|$|E
2500|$|Under an {{assumption}} of constant gravitational attraction, Newton's law of universal gravitation simplifies to F = mg, where m is {{the mass of}} the body and g is a constant vector with an average magnitude of 9.81m/s2 on Earth. This resulting force is the object's weight. The acceleration due to gravity is equal to this g. An initially stationary object which is allowed to fall freely under gravity drops a distance which is proportional to the square of the elapsed time. The image on the right, spanning half a second, was captured with a <b>stroboscopic</b> flash at 20 flashes per second. During the first [...] of a second the ball drops one unit of distance (here, a unit is about 12mm); by [...] it has dropped at total of 4 units; by , 9 units and so on.|$|E
2500|$|The chimney swift's {{wings are}} slender, curved and long, {{extending}} {{as much as}} [...] beyond the bird's tail when folded. Its wingtips are pointed, which helps to decrease air turbulence (and therefore drag) during flight. Its humerus (the bone in the inner part of the wing) is quite short, while the bones farther out (more distally) along the wing are elongated, a combination which allows the bird to flap very quickly. In flight, it holds its wings stiffly, alternating between rapid, quivering flaps and longer glides. Its flight profile is widely described as a [...] "cigar with wings"—a description first used by Roger Tory Peterson. Although the bird often appears to beat its wings asynchronously during flight, photographic and <b>stroboscopic</b> {{studies have shown that}} it beats them in unison. The illusion that it does otherwise is heightened by its very fast and highly erratic flight, with many rapid changes of direction.|$|E
2500|$|... 3D zoetropes {{apply the}} same {{principle}} to three-dimensional models. This variation was suggested by several inventors including Étienne-Jules Marey, who in 1887 used a large zoetrope to animate a series of plaster models based on his chronophotographs of birds in flight. Modern equivalents normally dispense with the slitted drum and instead use a rapidly flashing strobe light to illuminate the models, producing much clearer and sharper distortion-free results. The models are mounted on a rotating base and the light flashes on and off within an extremely small {{fraction of a second}} as each successive model passes the same spot. The <b>stroboscopic</b> effect makes each seem to be a single animated object. By allowing the rotation speed to be slightly out of synchronization with the strobe, the animated objects can be made to appear to also move slowly forwards or backwards, according to how much faster or slower each rotation is than the corresponding series of strobe flashes.|$|E
2500|$|Mechanical disc strobe tuners are expensive, bulky, delicate, {{and require}} {{periodic}} maintenance (keeping the motor that spins the disc at the correct speed, replacing the strobing LED backlight, etc.). For many, a mechanical strobe tuner {{is simply not}} practical for one {{or all of the}} above reasons. To address these issues, in 2001 Peterson Tuners added a line of non-mechanical electronic strobe tuners that have LCD dot-matrix displays mimicking a mechanical strobe disc display, giving a <b>stroboscopic</b> effect. In 2004 Peterson made a model of LCD strobe in a sturdy floor based [...] "stomp box" [...] for live on-stage use. Virtual strobe tuners are as accurate as standard mechanical disc strobe tuners. However, there are limitations to the virtual system compared to the disc strobes. Virtual strobes display fewer bands to read note information, and do not pick up harmonic partials like a disc strobe. Rather, each band on a virtual strobe represents octaves of the fundamental. A disc strobe provides [...] "one band correspondence"—each band displays a particular frequency of the note being played. On the virtual strobe system, each band combines a few close frequencies for easier reading on the LCD. This is still extremely accurate for intoning and tuning most instruments—but, as of this writing, no virtual strobe tuner provides detailed information on partials.|$|E
