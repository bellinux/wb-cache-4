40|$|Generally <b>swivel</b> <b>joints</b> often frameworks, notably beams one, {{and allow}} them to swivel in a point around the three space dimensions. In the {{modeling}} of those frameworks, <b>swivel</b> <b>joint</b> is supposed to be in a node. Between two elements at a node where there is a <b>swivel</b> <b>joint,</b> displacements are continuous and rotations are not. This paper is a contribution to the calculation of the rotations in a swivel point. Our calculation method is based on the finite elements method and the disturbance of the elementary stiffness matrix through the static condensation. At the end, we present analytical results obtained on the connected elements by moving the <b>swivel</b> <b>joint</b> from one element to another and the proposition to put simultaneously two <b>swivel</b> <b>joint</b> in two related elements...|$|R
40|$|Mechanic studies {{realized}} on the {{two dimensional}} beams structures with <b>swivel</b> <b>joints</b> show that in statics, the vertical displacement is continuous, but the rotation is discontinuous at the node {{where there is a}} <b>swivel</b> <b>joint.</b> Moreover, in dynamics, many authors do not usually take into account the friction effect, modeling of these structures. We propose in this paper, a modeling of the beams structures with <b>swivel</b> <b>joints</b> which integrates viscosity effects in dynamics. Hence this work we will present the formulation of motion equations of such structures and the modal analysis method which is used to solve these equations...|$|R

50|$|Caster flutter can be {{controlled}} by adding dampers or increasing the friction of the <b>swivel</b> <b>joints.</b> This {{can be accomplished by}} adding washers to the <b>swivel</b> <b>joint.</b> The friction increases as the weight {{on the front of the}} chair increases. Anytime the caster begins to flutter, it slows the chair and shifts weight to the front wheels. There are several online anti-flutter kits for retrofitting wheelchair casters in this manner. Other methods of reducing caster flutter include increasing swivel lead, using heavier grease, reducing the mass of the wheel, or increasing friction with the ground by changing materials.|$|R
50|$|Both {{types of}} loading arms are {{typically}} made of 3 pipes - respectively called inner arm, outer arm and drop pipe.The size can be from 2” to 6”. These 3 pipes are connected by <b>swivel</b> <b>joints.</b> <b>Swivel</b> <b>joints</b> {{are required to}} provide the flexibility needed. The loading arm unfolds to get the required working envelope to load or unload the tanker, and the reverse is to retract or get a minimal space for parking or storage.Both types of loading arms may be mounted on a column or via a plate to an existing wall.Balancing is needed due to {{the weight of the}} steel piping. Balancing of the arm is made by counterweight or by a spring balance cylinder.|$|R
50|$|The neGcon was {{an unusual}} design in that {{the left and right}} halves of the {{controller}} were connected by a <b>swivel</b> <b>joint</b> and thus the halves could be twisted relative to each other.

50|$|When {{existing}} {{warehouses and}} shops {{no longer have}} adequate headroom, the Saether approach of lifting the roof offers a simple solution {{at a fraction of}} the cost of new construction. The lifting is done in large units. All mechanical and electrical equipment hung from or supported on the roof is included in the lift. Where vertical runs are involved, they are cut and later rejoined. <b>Swivel</b> <b>joints</b> may be provided where continuous service is required.|$|R
50|$|Recently {{the design}} of the marine loading arms has been {{significantly}} improved by the symmetric design. This new concept offers many advantages such as the equal distribution of forces on the <b>swivel</b> <b>joints</b> under all conditions, less force within the structure, reduces the weight of the loading arm, and permits larger working envelopes without requiring significantly stronger construction.Since the symmetric design has proven its effectiveness and its reliability. The symmetric design is also applicable to marine loading arms requiring an independent support frame.|$|R

40|$|A high {{altitude}} parachute suspended solar pointing control {{system has been}} developed and flight tested {{for use in the}} altitude range of 30 to 70 kilometers. This development provides an opportunity for extended solar observations at altitudes higher than that attainable by helium balloons. The new system utilizes the NASA {{high altitude}} cross parachute to slow the descent of a rocket launched payload allowing observations in the region of interest. Solar pointing is established by using solar sensors in conjunction with a servo controlled platform and cold gas thrusters for payload roll control. The inherent spin of the cross parachute is decoupled by a <b>swivel</b> <b>joint</b> attached to the parachute suspension lines.

50|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with two {{underwater}} torpedo tubes. These were cast-iron cylinders {{attached to a}} <b>swivel</b> <b>joint</b> in the hull, one on each bow. Inside the ship the opposite end was attached to a graduated scale for targeting. There was a watertight door {{at either end of}} the tube. The 14 in torpedoes were loaded inside a brass cylinder which slid into the iron casting. To fire the torpedo, the outer door was opened and a 10 ft guide was extended which helped the torpedo clear the currents around the ship. A piston in the brass cylinder forced out the torpedo when it was to be fired, and at the same time its own compressed air motor was started.|$|R

2500|$|A marine {{loading arm}} is an {{alternative}} to direct hose hookups that is particularly useful for larger vessels and transfers at higher loading rates and pressures. [...] Controlled manually or hydraulically, a loading arm employs <b>swivel</b> <b>joints</b> and can, to some extent, follow the movement of a moored vessel. [...] Many loading arm systems feature quick-connect fittings. [...] Gasket or o-ring arrangements are required to make a [...] secure seal to the ship's manifold flange. [...] A loading arm must be drained or closed off before the connection is broken off. [...] This is usually done in two ways. For fuels such as gas oil and diesel, the lines can be blown out with high pressure air. In the case of fuels such as kerosene or petrol, the lines can be stripped with pumps.|$|R
50|$|The neGcon {{worked by}} means of gears turning the shafts of potentiometers. This system greatly reduced the logic {{required}} in the controller (important at the time) compared to a quadrature encoder-based system by removing the need for self-calibration and converting relative position to absolute position. The center pivot of the neGcon utilized a ring-gear driving a pinion on the shaft of the potentiometer, while the 3 analogue buttons each employed a rack driving similar pinions. These systems were large, with two potentiometers in the left half of the controller for the L shoulder button and center pivot and two potentiometers in the right half of the controller for the Ⅰ and Ⅱ buttons. Lack of space inside the unit precluded an analogue R shoulder button. However, extended use caused the <b>swivel</b> <b>joint</b> to wear.|$|R

5000|$|Surface {{blowdown}} continuously bleeds off a low {{volume of}} water from within the boiler {{as a means of}} ridding the boiler of dissolved impurities. It is most effective to remove water with the highest level of impurities; and such water is found where steam separates in the steam drum {{at the top of the}} boiler. There are two types of surface blowdown fittings. The simpler is a pipe entering the steam drum at the normal water level. A more sophisticated skimmer arrangement attaches a <b>swivel</b> <b>joint</b> to the pipe for a short length of pipe suspended by a float. [...] The skimmer may be more effective at removing floating oil which might otherwise cause foaming. Surface blowdown is normally fed to a flash tank and heat exchanger for heat recovery. The flashed steam can be used in the feedwater heater. These energy economies are seldom practical with infrequent bottom blowdown. Surface blowdown offers the additional advantage of steady-state operating conditions.|$|R
