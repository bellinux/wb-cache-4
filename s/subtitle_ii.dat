40|$|Watching a subtitled foreign film {{changes the}} way verbal {{information}} is presented {{and how we}} acquire it. Which are the implications for the acquisition and processing of visual and verbal information from a film scene when subtitles are present? To address this question we carried out an eye-tracking experiment. Participants watched a series of clips from an animated film. The task was to remember as much visual and verbal information as possible. Clips were presented in four different conditions {{in order to test}} the effect of presenting subtitles on the visual and verbal recall: (i) participants own language—no <b>subtitles,</b> (<b>ii)</b> participants own language—foreign language subtitles, (iii) foreign language—no subtitles, and (iv) foreign language—participants own language subtitles. Immediately after each clip, participants performed an oral free memory recall task and they answered a questionnaire about verbal information from the dialogues and visual information from elements showed in the clip. Scores from questionnaires and eye-movement data from areas of interest were later analysed. We observed that the presence of subtitles affects correct recall and eye movements. We discuss this effect as a function of verbal information presentation mode and subtitle’s language...|$|R

5000|$|Brigitte Lin portrayed Dongfang Bubai in the 1992 film Swordsman II, {{a sequel}} to The Swordsman. The plot differs largely from the novel and Dongfang Bubai is given a more {{prominent}} role as the primary antagonist. The following year, the producers released the film The East Is Red, with Dongfang Bubai as the main character. The East Is Red is unrelated to the novel except for its Chinese title Dongfang Bubai zhi Fengyun Zaiqi, which roughly translates to The Return of Dongfang Bubai. Lin's portrayal of Dongfang Bubai as a trans woman has influenced subsequent portrayals of the character; Dongfang Bubai has typically been depicted as a trans woman in television series based on The Smiling, Proud Wanderer since the 2000s. Dongfang Bubai is {{also referred to as}} [...] "Invincible Asia" [...] in the <b>subtitles</b> of Swordsman <b>II</b> and The East Is Red.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} automatically labelling appearances of characters in TV or film material with their names. This is tremendously challenging due to the huge variation in imaged appearance of each character and the weakness and ambiguity of available annotation. However, we demonstrate that high precision {{can be achieved by}} combining multiple sources of information, both visual and textual. The principal novelties that we introduce are: (i) automatic generation of time stamped character annotation by aligning <b>subtitles</b> and transcripts; (<b>ii)</b> strengthening the supervisory information by identifying when characters are speaking. In addition, we incorporate complementary cues of face matching and clothing matching to propose common annotations for face tracks, and consider choices of classifier which can potentially correct errors made in the automatic extraction of training data from the weak textual annotation. Results are presented on episodes of the TV series ‘‘Buffy the Vampire Slayer”. ...|$|R
50|$|Capital, Volume <b>II,</b> <b>subtitled</b> The Process of Circulation of Capital, was {{prepared}} by Friedrich Engels from notes left by Karl Marx {{and published in}} 1885. It {{is divided into three}} parts: The Metamorphoses of Capital and Their Circuits, The Turnover of Capital, and The Reproduction and Circulation of the Aggregate Social Capital. In Volume II, the main ideas behind the marketplace are to be found: how value and surplus-value are realized. Its dramatis personae are not so much the worker and the industrialist (as in Volume I), but rather the money owner (and money lender), the wholesale merchant, the trader and the entrepreneur or 'functioning capitalist.' Moreover, workers appear in Volume II, essentially as buyers of consumer goods and, therefore, as sellers of the commodity labour power, rather than producers of value and surplus-value — though this latter quality, established in Volume I, remains the solid foundation on which the whole of the unfolding analysis is based.|$|R
5000|$|Reigeluth is {{best known}} for his three edited volumes on Instructional-Design Theories and Models, which provide {{descriptions}} of a wide variety of instructional-design theories by the creators of those theories, along with chapters by Reigeluth on the nature of instructional-design theories and the theory-building process. Design theories are different from descriptive theories in that they are goal oriented, offering guidance about which methods should be used to achieve different kinds of goals in different situations - what Herbert Simon referred to as a [...] "design science". [...] These three volumes have several uncommon elements, including a foreword for every theory chapter that outlines the theory’s goals, values, and methods, and editor’s notes that compare aspects of each theory with other theories. Volume I, subtitled An Overview of their Current Status, was published in 1983. Volume <b>II,</b> <b>subtitled</b> A New Paradigm of Instructional Theory, was published in 1999. And Volume III, subtitled Building a Common Knowledge Base, was published in 2009. Reigeluth asserted that the primary goal of instructional design is enhancing human learning and development (1999, p. ix).|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} animal recognition models {{learned from}} wildlife video documentaries {{by using the}} weak supervision of the textual subtitles. This is a challenging setting, since i) the animals occur in their natural habitat and are often largely occluded and <b>ii)</b> <b>subtitles</b> are to a great degree complementary to the visual content, providing a very weak supervisory signal. This {{is in contrast to}} most work on integrated vision and language in the literature, where textual descriptions are tightly linked to the image content, and often generated in a curated fashion for the task at hand. We investigate different image representations and models, in particular a support vector machine on top of activations of a pretrained convolutional neural network, as well as a Naive Bayes framework on a ‘bag-of-activations’ image representation, where each element of the bag is considered separately. This representation allows key components in the image to be isolated, in spite of vastly varying backgrounds and image clutter, without an object detection or image segmentation step. The methods are evaluated based on how well they transfer to unseen camera-trap images captured across diverse topographical regions under different environmental conditions and illumination settings, involving a large domain shift. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Subtitling for the D/deaf and HoH (SDH) is an {{invaluable}} service {{to millions of}} D/deaf and HoH viewers providing them with access to audiovisual media broadcast on television and increasingly in cinemas, DVDs and on the Internet. It is also a clear example of an AVT activity where the requirement to know and understand the intended addressee, a requirement present in all types of translation, is all-important. Or is it? Subtitles today still purport to be suitable for all, when by all accounts {{not only are the}} D/deaf and HoH two different groups, but what is more important within each group members differ not only in outlook, but also in language and communication needs. The time now seems opportune to answer crucial questions and identify the addressees and their needs/preferences. In order to provide an adequate reply to such questions, a tripartite large-scale research plan is deemed essential. This would combine i) corpus-based research describing current <b>subtitle</b> output with <b>ii)</b> empirical research into the needs and preferences of D/deaf and HoH people and iii) compare both with existing guidelines and update them as necessary.
