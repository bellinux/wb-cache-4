6000|$|... "This job of {{teaching}} {{is getting worse}} and worse," [...] he grumbled to himself. [...] "It's too bad that I've got to waste my time on these boys. If I could only get back <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>money</b> I lost, I wouldn't spend another hour over this tiresome task," [...] and he heaved a deep sigh. The loss of his little fortune was the one great sore spot with him.|$|E

He hands over to the {{hospitals}} where some of us die--and it's all advertised. He forks out to the church. Now, I put it to you, why don't he sink <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>money</b> where it belongs--in living wages? Because there's nothing in it for him--that's why." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{the face}} which is beneath that chignon and that hat? Well--it is {{sometimes}} pretty: but how seldom handsome, {{which is a}} higher quality by far. It is not, strange to say, a well-fed face. Plenty of money, and perhaps too much, is spent on those fine clothes. It had been better, to judge from the complexion, if <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>money</b> had been spent in solid wholesome food. She looks as if she lived--as she too often does, I hear--on tea and bread-and-butter, or rather on bread with the minimum of butter. For as the want of bone indicates a deficiency of phosphatic food, so does the want of flesh about the cheeks indicate a deficiency of hydrocarbon. Poor little Nausicaa:- that is not her fault. Our boasted civilisation has not even taught her what to eat, as it certainly has not increased her appetite; and she knows not-- what every country fellow knows--that without plenty of butter and other fatty matters, she {{is not likely to}} keep even warm. Better to eat nasty fat bacon now, than to supply the want of it some few years hence by nastier cod-liver oil. But there is no one yet to tell her that, and a dozen other equally simple facts, for her own sake, {{and for the sake of}} that coming Demos which she is to bring into the world; a Demos which, if we can only keep it healthy in body and brain, has before it so splendid a future: but which, if body and brain degrade beneath the influence of modern barbarism, is but too likely to follow the Demos of ancient Byzantium, or of modern Paris.|$|E

In a reorganisation of schools in 1930 the Free School became a junior school and senior pupils from Somerton {{had to go to}} Fritwell. The school was still open in the 1950s but has since closed.|$|R

5000|$|After winning re-election, Bush {{called for}} changes in Social Security {{as part of his}} vision of an [...] "ownership society." [...] Bush wanted to restructure the program so that {{citizens}} could invest <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the <b>money</b> <b>that</b> went to the payroll taxes that fund the program. Bush argued that Social Security faced an imminent funding crisis and that reform was necessary to ensure its continuing solvency. However, Bush's plan earned unified opposition from congressional Democrats and failed to attract the necessary support from Republicans, and legislation on Social Security reform was never brought to a vote.|$|R
5000|$|After a few weeks, Leigh {{discovered}} {{she was pregnant}} by Tony and confronted her mother. Jillian, convinced that Leigh had seduced Tony on purpose, called her a slut for [...] "going all the way". It was then that Leigh realized Tony was right about her mother. Disgusted, Leigh told her mother that she knew Jillian wasn't a virgin before she married {{and that she had}} essentially pimped her own daughter out to Tony to avoid having sex with him. After the fight, Leigh stole <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Tony's <b>money</b> <b>that</b> he kept in a strongbox and fled Farthinggale Manor with a few meagre possessions and her portrait doll.|$|R

You might be able to make up <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the <b>money</b> <b>that</b> way, but I don't think that anyone who is interested in making money is going to invest on that basis — invest in this really risky proposition, and if you're lucky you'll break even?

50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport planned a new runway which would route air traffic over {{parts of the}} refuge. A real estate {{appraisal}} firm arbitrated a settlement to compensate the refuge for {{the environmental impact of}} the noise pollution. The airport’s commission voted unanimously to accept the settlement in 1998 and ultimately paid $26 million into the Minnesota Valley Trust. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>money</b> was used in 2004 and 2005 to purchase 420 acres (1.7 km2) between the Chaska and Rapids Lake Units.|$|E
50|$|Anaky {{was born}} in Bondoukou and was an adopted son of President Félix Houphouët-Boigny. He founded the Inter Transit company in the late 1970s and headed the company as its President Director-General. In November 1988, he participated in the {{constitutive}} congress of the opposition Ivorian Popular Front (FPI). Anaky used money from his business to finance the FPI. Houphouët-Boigny loaned Anaky 100 million CFA francs for the company, but Anaky allegedly used <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>money</b> to support the FPI.

As I walk along, I try to find, among the grass and moss, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> small <b>money</b> for which she works so hard and used to shed so many tears. As I lie asleep in the shade, I dream of it--dream of digging it up in heaps; and spying it out, hidden under bushes; and seeing it sparkle, as the dew-drops do, among the leaves. But I never find it. Tell me where it is. I'd go there, if the journey were a whole year long, because I know she would be happier when I came home and brought some with me. Speak again.

5000|$|The Fine Bros. (Popular Youtubers) {{created a}} program called [...] "React World" [...] and trademarked the word [...] "React".

50|$|In 1982 the U.S. Department of Agriculture made a {{push for}} energy conservation. One {{part of that}} program was funding to improve {{insulation}} on many buildings. The U.S. Forest Service received <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>money</b> to insulate {{the roof of the}} arena and the next year the roof collapsed. What was not appreciated at the time was that the roof was not built to hold much snow, but had survived for 23 years without a problem. The plan had always been that heat generated from the ice chilling equipment in the arena traveled to the ceiling, warmed the uninsulated roof, and melted the snow. With the energy conservation measures in place, the snow did not melt due to waste heat and the building collapsed under the weight.|$|E

Plagued by his father's death and feeling an obligation not to sully his name, Dov Rosofsky took the new name [...] "Barney Ross."

5000|$|In January 2006, Elmendorf {{was criticized}} vehemently by some left-wing Democratic bloggers {{when he was}} quoted in a Washington Post story as saying, [...] "The bloggers and online donors {{represent}} an important resource for the party, {{but they are not}} representative of the majority you need to win elections. The trick will be to harness their energy and their money without looking like you are a captive of the activist left." [...] Markos Moulitsas, head of the Daily Kos blog, replied: [...] "Here's notice, any Democrat associated with Elmendorf will be outed. The netroots can then decide for itself whether it wants to provide <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> energy and <b>money</b> to <b>that</b> candidate. There's nothing 'extreme left' with demanding Democrats act like Democrats, no matter how much these out-of-touch and self-important beltway insiders think it is." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1890 a Royal Commission found <b>that</b> {{construction}} <b>of</b> {{the fort}} was faulty {{due to the}} use of inferior concrete. The whole project started to crumble before it was completed. The Royal Commission was very critical of the material used and were reluctant to refer to the material as concrete. The two clerks who were responsible for the operation, Henry Purkis and Edwin Colley, were found to be neglectful in their duties of inspecting the site. The contractor responsible was asked to repay <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the <b>money</b> <b>that</b> was paid out to him. He was also banned from any other government contracts. Barnet was eventually blamed for failing to oversee the project and to limit the amount of extra funds paid out to the contractor. This led to his resignation in disgrace from government office.|$|R
