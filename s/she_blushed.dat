6000|$|In her tire-glass gaz√®d she, and <b>she</b> <b>blushed</b> right womanly-- [...] Toll slowly. [...] <b>She</b> <b>blushed</b> {{half from}} her disdain, half her beauty was so plain, [...] --"Oath for oath, my lord of Leigh!" ...|$|E
60|$|Alice smiled; but {{regarding}} Heyward, <b>she</b> <b>blushed</b> and hesitated.|$|E
60|$|This {{confused}} Allie out of {{her sweet}} gravity, and <b>she</b> <b>blushed.</b>|$|E
60|$|Bessy Bell did {{not look}} insulted. <b>She</b> did not <b>blush.</b> <b>She</b> did not show shame. Her eyes darkened. Her rosy mouth lost {{something}} of its soft curves.|$|R
60|$|Lyndar. This favour {{does your}} handmaid much oblige, But {{we are not}} {{provided}} for a siege: My subjects few; and their provision thin; The foe is strong without, we weak within. This to my noble lord may seem unkind, But he will weigh it in his princely mind; And pardon her, who does assurance want So much, <b>she</b> <b>blushes</b> when <b>she</b> cannot grant.|$|R
50|$|Simran Bhalla: She is {{addressed}} as 'Choti' by the elders in the family. She is also {{madly in love}} with her husband. <b>She</b> <b>blushes</b> whenever <b>she</b> sees him or whenever someone mentions his name. She is very innocent and doesn't know a lot of cooking. She is equally obsessed with her husband's body building. She believes in the power of 'taveez' and keeps getting taveez for different reasons for her husband and other family members.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>blushed</b> {{a little}} as she shook hands rather awkwardly with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope you'll get {{something}} at home," [...] Cleer said, simply, with a blush, and then blamed herself for saying it. <b>She</b> <b>blushed</b> {{again at the}} thought. She looked prettiest when <b>she</b> <b>blushed.</b> Walter Tyrrel, a little behind, stood and admired her all the while. But Eustace was flattered she should think of wanting him to remain in England.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>blushed</b> and fluttered now, looked half angry, half beseeching, and {{altogether}} lovely.|$|E
6000|$|... "What sentimentalists men {{of science}} are!" [...] exclaimed Father Brown, [...] "and {{how much more}} sentimental must American men of science be! Who but a Yankee would think of proving {{anything}} from heart-throbs? Why, they must be as sentimental {{as a man who}} thinks a woman is in love with him if <b>she</b> <b>blushes.</b> That's a test from the circulation of the blood, discovered by the immortal Harvey; and a jolly rotten test, too." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{waves that}} wash Betty to shore {{on an island}} spank her once. Then she walks ashore and takes off her wet outer clothes out of sight behind {{what appears to be}} a boulder, but it turns out to be a turtle that sticks out its head and legs and walks off, exposing Betty in her {{underwear}} and bra. <b>She</b> <b>blushes</b> and runs behind some shrubs, where she puts on a skirt made of palm leaves (with her bra exposed) before reappearing.|$|R
60|$|She curtseyed again, {{and would}} have <b>blushed</b> deeper, if <b>she</b> could have <b>blushed</b> deeper than <b>she</b> had <b>blushed</b> all this time. Bitzer, after rapidly {{blinking}} at Thomas Gradgrind with both eyes at once, and so catching the light upon his quivering ends of lashes that they looked like the antennae of busy insects, put his knuckles to his freckled forehead, and sat down again.|$|R
60|$|Elma blushed again, and Guy {{noticed in}} passing that <b>she</b> <b>blushed</b> very prettily.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>blushed</b> {{and looked}} down the river. 'I cannot give my reasons,' she said.|$|E

50|$|Passorn is a cheerful, lively girl, {{a member}} of the first unit. She is Ganda's {{assistant}} when he joins the army, and uses a long gun skillfully. In the real world, she is a shy girl who is in love with Ganda. She never shows her feelings; <b>she</b> <b>blushes</b> when Ganda is around, and all she can do is look at Ganda from behind him in the classroom. The picture in the infobox shows Passorn above in the game and below in the real world.|$|R
6000|$|... "It vexed me, it kindled my ire, to {{find that}} <b>she</b> neither <b>blushed,</b> trembled, nor looked down. She responded, 'I doubt whether I have {{understood}} you, Mr. Moore.' ...|$|R
60|$|Grace smiled, and, {{as soon as}} Lucy's {{animation}} had {{a little}} subsided, <b>she</b> <b>blushed.</b>|$|E

60|$|Eve {{smiled as}} her nurse grew warm, but <b>she</b> <b>blushed</b> {{in spite of}} an effort to seem indifferent.|$|E
500|$|The {{picture in}} Barton's {{room of a}} woman at the beach is a central focus for both the {{character}} and camera. He examines it frequently while at his desk, and after finding Audrey's corpse in his bed he goes to stand near it. The image is repeated {{at the end of the}} film, when he meets an identical-looking woman at an identical-looking beach, who strikes an identical pose. After complimenting her beauty, he asks her: [...] "Are you in pictures?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>blushes</b> and replies: [...] "Don't be silly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, but Robert does, and I {{sometimes}} think I do.' (Then it came.) 'You think Mr. Randolf like him?' Thanks to her hat, <b>she</b> could <b>blush</b> more comfortably now.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{may just}} as well {{do away with the}} fence. You could have your drying-line out, quite clear of your flowers." [...] He winked, and <b>she</b> would <b>blush</b> faintly.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>blushed</b> as beautifully as ever. Then she {{produced}} {{a small but}} plutocratic-looking purse {{and handed it to}} him.|$|E
60|$|He {{raised the}} fingers to his lips--the waiter {{had left the}} room. <b>She</b> <b>blushed,</b> but yielded her hand readily enough.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nonsense, Charles,' said Laura, hastily; then {{afraid she}} had owned to annoyance, <b>she</b> <b>blushed</b> and was angry with herself for blushing.|$|E
60|$|She was {{blushing}} as <b>she</b> had <b>blushed</b> when <b>she</b> {{first saw}} him at Blanquais. She seemed to Bernard now {{to have a great}} and peculiar brightness--something she had never had before.|$|R
50|$|Alie Lectric - she {{lights up}} in colors and is brainy and organized. She is 200 {{trillion}} light {{years old and}} wants to teach her friends on Earth to think like a star. <b>She</b> <b>blushes</b> in different colors, and has a colorful and bold style. She can't decide what she likes best food-wise, but loves doing Earth math as she thinks it's easy. She wants {{to learn how to}} not blush around cute Earth boys, and she doesn't really get static electricity. She is preppy and typically wears ankle boots. Her pet is called Hi-Def, and her symbol is a heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! famously--just as all girls do, you know. <b>She</b> <b>blushes,</b> and {{sometimes}} <b>she</b> looks vexed; then she smiles, and puts up her lip, and says 'Nonsense!' and 'What folly!' 'Rupert, I'm surprised at you!' {{and all that}} sort of stuff, which deceives nobody, you'll understand, not even her poor, simple, silly brother. But, Miles, I must quit you now, for I have an engagement to accompany a party to the theatre, and {{was on my way to}} join them when we met. Cooper plays, and you know what a lion he is; one would not wish to lose a syllable of his Othello." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>blushed</b> {{a little}} and Bateman, with the grave smile which was so {{attractive}} in him, finished the sentence for her.|$|E
60|$|Angela hesitated, and Angela blushed, though why {{she hesitated}} and why <b>she</b> <b>blushed</b> was {{perhaps more than}} she could have exactly said.|$|E
6000|$|... "You won't tell on me, will you?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>blushed</b> red as a {{carnation}} now. Strange {{mixture of}} child and woman, thought Thatcher.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{you must}} not die! Oh, {{you must not}}!' she said. And on an impulse she bent down and whispered some words to him, {{blushing}} as <b>she</b> had <b>blushed</b> in her maiden days.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] said Rosey, quickly; [...] "he {{must not}} know I have been here!" [...] She stopped. The honest blush flew to her cheek, and then {{returned}} again, because <b>she</b> had <b>blushed.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you well, Seignior Quentin?" [...] {{said the}} Countess Isabelle, {{in a tone}} of {{interest}} at which <b>she</b> herself <b>blushed,</b> while <b>she</b> felt that it was something more than the distance between them warranted.|$|R
