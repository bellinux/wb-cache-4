The reliability and validity of the different <b>social</b> network, <b>social</b> support and <b>social</b> influence indices are analyzed and discussed. The relation between the different indices and marital status and <b>social</b> class are analyzed implying that men living alone and men in the lowest <b>social</b> class have the most insufficient <b>social</b> network, <b>social</b> support and <b>social</b> influence. The indices were then used in an analysis of nervous problems and insomnia. <b>Social</b> anchorage, <b>social</b> participation and contact frequency, all subconcepts of <b>social</b> network, had independent associations with mental health in this cross-sectional study. The addition of the <b>social</b> network, <b>social</b> support and <b>social</b> influence indices to <b>social</b> class and marital status gives a more differentiated and thereby a more valid picture of the association between the psychosocial environment and this type of mental health problems. <b>social</b> network <b>social</b> support <b>social</b> class marital status epidemiology mental health problems...|$|R
