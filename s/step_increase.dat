50|$|The opossum shrimp, Mysis diluviana, were {{introduced}} by Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks in the Flathead drainage basin to encourage production of larger kokanee salmon {{and wound up}} in Flathead Lake. Lake trout had been introduced 80 years prior but remained at low densities until nonnative Mysis became established. The bottom-dwelling mysids eliminated a recruitment bottleneck for lake trout by providing a deep water source of food where little was available previously. Lake trout subsequently flourished on mysids and this voracious piscivore now dominates the lake fishery; formerly abundant kokanee were extirpated, and native bull and westslope cutthroat trout are imperiled. Predation by Mysis shifted zooplankton and phytoplankton community size structure. Bayesian change point analysis of primary productivity (27-y time series) showed a significant <b>step</b> <b>increase</b> of 55 mg C m−2 d−1 (i.e., 21% rise) concurrent with the mysid invasion, but little trend before or after despite increasing nutrient loading.

40|$|Free-air CO 2 {{enrichment}} (FACE) {{studies are}} the ultimate test bed for hypothe-ses that seek to explain how plants respond to rising [CO 2]; and they provide the most realistic conditions for simulating the impact of future elevated (e) [CO 2] levels (see Chapter 2). FACE studies have many benefits over con-trolled environment and open-top chamber (OTC) experiments. FACE allows the investigation of an undisturbed ecosystem and does not modify the vege-tation’s interaction with light, temperature, wind, precipitation, pathogens and insects (Long et al. 2004). This, {{in combination with the}} large size of FACE plots, allows the integrated measurement of many plant and ecosystem processes simultaneously in the same plot, avoids many of the problems asso-ciated with edge effects prevalent in OTCs (Long et al. 2004), enables signifi-cantly more plant material to be harvested without compromising the exper-iment, and allows plants to be studied throughout their life cycle, including trees that have enough space to develop to canopy closure. FACE experiments are not without their problems (see Chapter 2). In par-ticular, there has been criticism that the application of a <b>step</b> <b>increase</b> in [CO 2] to ecosystems imposes a strong perturbation (Luo and Reynolds 1999; New-ton et al. 2001). Luo and Reynolds (1999) modelled the effects of a <b>step</b> <b>increase</b> in [CO 2] and found that the demand for N caused by the additional carbon influx from the <b>step</b> <b>increase</b> is much greater than that caused by a gradual increase in [CO 2], resulting in an initial overestimation of carbon sequestration in experiments using a <b>step</b> <b>increase</b> in [CO 2]. This should be a minor problem in annual agro-ecosystems where plants have spent their whole life-cycle under FACE. However, in natural ecosystems, or perennial agro-ecosystems, a <b>step</b> <b>increase</b> in [CO 2] is {{more likely to have a}} significant effect.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{theoretical}} {{changes in}} shape and velocity of an action potential were computed in regions of changing core conductor geometry. Step decrease and <b>step</b> <b>increase</b> of diameter, branch points, and gradual taper or flare of diameter were studied. Results showed increase of both velocity and peak height as the action potential approaches a point of step decrease. A <b>step</b> <b>increase</b> causes decrease of both velocity and peak height with approach; propagation may either fail, succeed with brief delay, or, with longer delay, succeed in both forward and reverse directions. With branching, both the shape and the dimensionless velocity, TO/A, remain un-changed when the d 312 values are matched. Without such matching, the changes of shape and dimensionless velocity of an action potential correspond to those found for step decrease or <b>step</b> <b>increase</b> of diameter. For regions of flare or taper, it was found (for a specific previously defined class) that velocity changed in proportion with the changing length constant. A simple formula was found to predict how this propor-tionality constant depends upon the amount of flare or taper...|$|E
40|$|Transient {{and steady}} state {{nucleate}} boiling in saturated LN 2 and F 113 at standard and near zero gravity conditions were investigated for the horizontal up, {{vertical and horizontal}} down orientations of the heating surface. Two distinct regimes of heat transfer mechanisms were observed during the interval from the <b>step</b> <b>increase</b> of power input to the onset of nucleate boiling: the conduction and convection dominated regimes. The time duration in each regime was considerably shorter with LN 2 than with F 113, and decreased as heat flux increased, as gravity was reduced, and as the orientation was changed from horizontal up to horizontal down. In transient boiling, boiling initiates at a single point following the <b>step</b> <b>increase</b> in power, and then spreads over the surface. The delay time for the inception of boiling at the first site, and the velocity of spread of boiling varies depending upon the heat flux, orientation, body force, surface roughness and liquid properties, and are a consequence of changes in boundary layer temperature levels associated with changes in natural convection. Following the <b>step</b> <b>increase</b> in power input, surface temperature overshoot and undershoot occur before the steady state boiling temperature level is established...|$|E
