5|$|While Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is having}} a meeting with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) in his office, Robert California (James Spader) appears {{at the window and}} frantically says that his wife Susan (Maura Tierney) is looking for a job in the office, and that Andy must not give her one. When Susan arrives, Andy {{compliantly}} tells her that they have no openings, but Robert insists that they have a look around before coming to any conclusions. Susan looks at the different departments, and decides on accounting. Andy again claims the office is already fully staffed, but Robert insists that he give her a job, even pressuring Andy by reminding him of his power as CEO. Confused by Robert's mixed messages, Andy relents and gives her a job, but Robert later calls Andy on the phone to berate him for hiring Susan. Andy asks everyone in the office to treat her poorly to drive her out, which makes everyone uncomfortable as they like her, but end up doing so nevertheless. When Susan notices their behavior, she complains to Robert, who asks Andy to discuss the issues with Susan in the conference room and leaves. Susan eventually realizes it was Robert's idea to drive her away. When they call Robert out, he vehemently denies it. Andy tells them Jim also heard him <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want her working at the office, which Jim overhears, prompting him to flee the office. Robert orders security to close the gate, preventing him from leaving. Jim then runs all over the building, but Andy and Robert find him and take him back to the office. After trying unsuccessfully to deflect their questions about what Robert told Andy, Jim blurts out that he is baffled at Robert's attitude, since Jim enjoys working in the same place as his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and misses her while she is on maternity leave. Andy and Jim leave the conference room and after a short while, Robert and Susan leave. In the parking lot, Andy apologizes to Susan and after brief small talk, Susan asks Andy out on a date, leaving him surprised.|$|E
25|$|Whether Abu Bakr {{actually}} intended a full-out imperial conquest {{or not is}} hard to <b>say.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did,</b> however, set {{in motion}} a historical trajectory (continued later on by Umar and Uthman) that in just a few short decades would lead to one of the largest empires in history, beginning with a confrontation with the Sassanid Empire under the general Khalid ibn al-Walid.|$|E
25|$|On August 24, 1939, a Cleveland {{resident}} named Frank Dolezal, 52, {{was arrested}} {{as a suspect}} in Florence Polillo's murder; he later died under suspicious circumstances in the Cuyahoga County jail. After his death {{it was discovered that}} he had suffered six broken ribs—injuries his friends <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not have when arrested by Sheriff Martin L. O'Donnell some six weeks prior. Most researchers believe that no evidence exists that Dolezal was involved in the murders, although at one time he did admit killing Florence Polillo in self-defense. Before his death, he recanted his confession and recanted two others as well, saying he had been beaten until he confessed.|$|E

25|$|The {{next morning}} the group gets dressed and prepares to leave the keep. Útgarða-Loki appears, has his {{servants}} prepare a table, and they all merrily eat and drink. As they leave, Útgarða-Loki asks Thor how he thought he fared in the contests. Thor {{says that he is}} unable to <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> well, noting that he is particularly annoyed that Útgarða-Loki will now speak negatively about him. Útgarða-Loki points out that the group has left his keep and says that he hopes that they never return to it, for if he had an inkling of what he was dealing with he would never have allowed the group to enter in the first place. Útgarða-Loki reveals that all was not what it seemed to the group. Útgarða-Loki was in fact the immense Skrýmir, and that if the three blows Thor attempted to land had hit their mark, the first would have killed Skrýmir. In reality, Thor's blows were so powerful that they had resulted in three square valleys.|$|E
500|$|As the 30th anniversary approached, Gerrold {{had heard}} {{rumors of a}} tribble-sequel in the works but had only heard denials from {{executive}} producer Rick Berman. Following an interview request from The New York Times, he telephoned Berman once more to ask what was happening as {{he did not want}} to <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not know about the sequel episode and embarrass anyone if it actually was going to happen. Gerrold suggested that an acknowledgement of the creator of the tribbles might be in order and asked if he could be an extra. He was cast as a security redshirt. While Gerrold was on set, he also advised director Jonathan West on the integration of new scenes into [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles". Gerrold later said that [...] "Trials and Tribble-ations" [...] "turned out beautiful. I think it was the best episode of Deep Space Nine ever and possibly the best episode of Star Trek after the Original Series." [...] Charlie Brill returned as Arne Darvin to film new scenes set in the DS9 timeframe.|$|E
500|$|Nintendo Power named Kefka {{the best}} villain {{to appear on}} Nintendo {{consoles}} in 1994, ranking higher than Donkey Kong Countrys King K. Rool and Marvel Comics' Carnage. They again featured him in their January 2010 issue, ranking him as their third favorite Nintendo villain. He also was ranked 3rd place in the [...] "Our Favorite Villains," [...] section of their [...] "250 Reasons to Love Nintendo," [...] article. He was described as [...] "An insane, remorseless clown with godlike powers who wants to destroy everyone and everything (and comes frighteningly close to achieving his goal), Kefka is downright evil." [...] UGO.com named him third in their [...] "Top 25 Japanese RPG Characters" [...] article, stating [...] "Insane, nihilistic, and cruel, Kefka isn't a reserved mystery like other Final Fantasy villains – rather, he's in-your-face at all times, doing dirty deeds just to <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> them." [...] Digital Spy states that he caused {{some of the most}} surprising moments in the Final Fantasy series when he destroyed the world. IGN ranked him sixth on their list of the [...] "Top 25" [...] Final Fantasy characters of all time, noting that several factors, such as his dialogue and appearance, contributed to his memorability as a character; in a [...] "Reader's Choice" [...] edition of the article he placed eighth, with similar comments. He was also ranked 18th in IGN's [...] "Top 100 Videogame Villains" [...] list. GamePro ranked him 33rd on the top 47 most diabolical video game villains of all time, citing both his [...] "genocide" [...] and his enslavement of Terra. GamesRadar ranked him the most [...] "outrageous camp bad guys", stating that when compared to Kefka, Final Fantasy VII antagonist Sephiroth seems as interesting as a dead accountant painted brown. They also compared him to Batman antagonist the Joker, praising him for both his villainous ambition and his laugh. GameSpy declared that Kefka is quite possibly the greatest video game villain of all time.|$|E

[...] Green told the crowd [...] "To be honest, {{it was a very}} {{difficult}} fight because ... it's hard to explain – some nights you fight some nights you don't.

In a pre-release copy of Young's book, obtained by the Wall Street Journal, Young revealed that after Edwards and Hunter returned {{from a trip to}} Uganda in 2006, Elizabeth answered Edward's mobile to hear Hunter [...] "launch into a romantic monologue."

Young also revealed that Edwards had confided in him about wanting to leave [...] "crazy Elizabeth", but could not, as she engaged with American voters better than he did.|$|E
