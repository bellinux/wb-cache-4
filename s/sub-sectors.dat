Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. Access {{to credit}} has been {{identified}} as a crucial tool in increasing fish production in the developing countries like Nigeria. Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund (ACGSF) was established for the purpose of boosting agricultural production (fish production inclusive). It is, therefore, imperative to study the Influence of Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund on fishery development in Nigeria. Secondary data between 1981 and 2012 were collected on relevant variables and analysed using Descriptive statistics, Growth function and Regression analysis. The results of the analysis showed that fishery <b>sub-sector</b> is the least financed in the agricultural sector of the economy. This is reflected in low contribution of fishery <b>sub-sector</b> to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) {{due to the fact that}} the required importance is not given to the <b>sub-sector</b> as it is poorly financed by ACGSF. Also, growth rate of fishery contribution to GDP was 10. 63 % and the proportion of GDP from fishery to total GDP from Agriculture was 0. 005 %. The results further showed that volume of ACGSF loan to fishery <b>sub-sector</b> and agricultural sector had significant influence on the GDP contribution from fishery <b>sub-sector.</b> In conclusion, fishery <b>sub-sector</b> has been experiencing poor finance from Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund. Therefore, the study recommended that volume of ACGSF credit devoted to fishery <b>sub-sector</b> should be significantly increased if sustainable development will be recorded in the <b>sub-sector.</b> Also, credit given to the <b>sub-sector</b> should be monitored in order to prevent diversion and poor management...|$|R
