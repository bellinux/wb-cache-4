5|$|BAe test pilots {{cleared the}} {{aircraft}} carrier ' for Harrier operations in July 1989. The carrier, which replaced the World War II-era , has a 12° <b>ski-jump</b> ramp. It was originally planned that the first unit to operate the aircraft would be the 8a Escuadrilla. This unit was disbanded on 24 October 1986, following the sales of AV-8S Matadors to Thailand. Instead, 9a Escuadrilla was formed on 29 September 1987, {{to become part of}} the Alpha Carrier Air Group and operate the EAV-8B.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Ski-jumping</b> was {{qualified}} as {{a sporting event}} 100 years ago in Scandinavia and northern regions of Russia, and from the first years scientists helped athletes to sharpen their techniques. The first of them was R. Shtrauman, who created the "Norway " style of jump in 1924. There have been several studies about <b>ski-jumping</b> published in the last tw...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{concept of}} core {{stability}} and balance are emphasized during athletic training for Norwegian ski jumpers. The impression of {{how important it}} can be for sport performance {{has long been a}} matter of interest within research. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the association between core stability, balance and <b>ski-jumping</b> performance ability in competitive ski jumpers. Methods: Eleven male ski jumpers were tested for steadiness in two commonly used core exercises (plank and balance exercise) in the ski jump environment. <b>Ski-jumping</b> performance ability was ranked by a group of experienced trainers. Inertial measurement units were used to obtain acceleration and angular velocity, and Oqus cameras and Qualisys Track Manager software were used to determine segment- and joint angles. Performance from the core exercises was compared to <b>ski-jumping</b> performance ability. Results: The main findings show a negative relationship for the steadiness in the lower back (plank exercise), and a positive relationship for elbow angle movement (balance exercise) with <b>ski-jumping</b> performance ability. Discussion and conclusion: Small amplitude motion in the lower back during the plank exercise is related to <b>ski-jumping</b> performance ability. The participants had some technical differences in execution, which may have had an impact on the results...|$|R
5|$|The Harrier GR.1 {{made its}} first flight on 28 December 1967. It officially entered service with the RAF on 18 April 1969 when the Harrier Conversion Unit at RAF Wittering {{received}} its first aircraft. The aircraft were built in two factories—one in Kingston upon Thames, southwest London, and the other at Dunsfold Aerodrome, Surrey—and underwent initial testing at Dunsfold. The <b>ski-jump</b> technique for launching Harriers from Royal Navy aircraft carriers was extensively trialled at RNAS Yeovilton from 1977. Following these tests ski-jumps {{were added to the}} flight decks of all RN carriers from 1979 onwards, in preparation for the new variant for the navy, the Sea Harrier.|$|E
5|$|The IOC {{awarded the}} 1960 Olympics to Squaw Valley, United States. Since the village had no facilities, {{there was a}} rush to {{construct}} infrastructure and sports facilities including an ice arena, speed-skating track, and a <b>ski-jump</b> hill. The opening and closing ceremonies were produced by Walt Disney. The Squaw Valley Olympics was the first winter Olympics to have a dedicated athletes' village, {{the first to use}} a computer (courtesy of IBM) to tabulate results, and the first to feature female speed skating events. The bobsleigh events were absent for the only time due to the cost of building a bobsleigh run.|$|E
5|$|To {{prepare for}} the {{operations}} of the Su-27K and the rival MiG-29K on-board the new carrier, work proceeded {{on the development of the}} steam catapult, arresting gear, optical and radio landing systems. The pilots were trained at a new establishment in Crimea, named NITKA, for Aviation Research and Training Complex. In 1981, the Soviet government ordered the abandonment of the catapult system as part of an overall downsize of Project 1143.5 carriers, which also included cancelling the fifth Project 1143 carrier and the Varyag. A takeoff ramp was installed at the complex, where takeoffs would be executed to ensure that the Su-27Ks and MiG-29Ks would be able to operate from carriers. Both Sukhoi and Mikoyan modified their prototypes to validate the takeoff ramp. Three Sukhoi T10s (−3, −24 and −25), along with an Su-27UB, were used for takeoffs from the simulated ramp. The first of these tests were undertaken by Nikolai Sadovnikov on 28 August 1982. Flight tests indicated the need for a change in ramp design, and it was modified to a <b>ski-jump</b> profile.|$|E
50|$|The {{mission of}} the Salisbury Winter Sports Association is to acquaint our nearby communities, {{especially}} the children, with Nordic <b>ski-jumping</b> and cross-country and Alpine skiing, and to teach the skills necessary for their enjoyment and lifelong pursuit. As part of its mission, SWSA hosts and perpetuates the annual <b>ski-jumping</b> competition on Satre Hill to sustain ski jumping in Salisbury and the Eastern United States.|$|R
50|$|Widhölzl {{began his}} World Cup <b>ski-jumping</b> career in 1993. Between 1997 and 2000, he won two Olympic bronzes and two world {{championship}} medals, along with sixteen victories in World Cup events. During this time came his {{victory in the}} 1999/2000 Four Hills Tournament. During this season, he came second in the <b>ski-jumping</b> World Cup. In the next five years, he won only one World Cup event, however, in 2005 he twice won the world championship with the Austrian National Team {{and a year later}} {{he was part of the}} Austrian Team that won the Team Olympic Gold Medal at the Winter Olympics. In March 2008, following health problems, he ended his fifteen-year-long World Cup <b>ski-jumping</b> career.|$|R

25|$|For {{take-off}} {{of fixed}} wing aircraft, Admiral Kuznetsov uses a <b>ski-jump</b> {{at the end}} of her bow. On take-off aircraft accelerate toward and up the <b>ski-jump</b> using their afterburners. This results in the aircraft leaving the deck at a higher angle and elevation than on an aircraft carrier with a flat deck and catapults. The <b>ski-jump</b> take-off is less demanding on the pilot, since the acceleration is lower, but results in a clearance speed of only 120–140km/h (75–85mph) requiring an aircraft design which will not stall at those speeds.|$|E

25|$|A {{major upgrade}} between 1979 and 1982 saw the carrier {{fitted with a}} new {{propulsion}} system, an updated radar suite, and a 9.75° <b>ski-jump</b> ramp {{to be used by}} Sea Harriers. The carrier was last deployed in 1994, and she was decommissioned in 1997. Vikrant helped the Indian Navy to become the dominant regional power.|$|E

25|$|The major {{modifications}} were to allow Admiral Gorshkov {{to operate as}} a STOBAR aircraft carrier in Indian service, {{as opposed to the}} STOVL configuration the ship was built as. This involved removal of all the armament, including the P-500 Bazalt cruise missile launchers and the four Antey Kinzhal surface-to-air missile bins fitted on ship's bow, {{to make way for a}} 14.3°, full-width <b>ski-jump.</b> The 20-ton capacity aircraft lift beside the ship's island superstructure was unchanged, but the aft lift was enlarged and its lift capacity increased to 30 tons. For STOBAR operations, three 30m arrestor wires and three restraining gears on the stern of the angled deck were fitted. Sponsons were installed to increase the area of the flight deck, to allow the <b>ski-jump</b> to be fitted, for strengthening of arresting gear and runway area, and to lengthen the after end, which allowed an increase to the length of the landing strip aft of the arresting gear. 234 new hull sections were installed to achieve the desired shape, and the total steel added to carry out these modifications amounted to 2500 tons.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ski-jump</b> ramp of Juan Carlos I {{has been}} {{retained}} for the RAN ships, although {{is not intended}} for use. The Spanish use the ramp to launch Harrier jet aircraft, and although operating STOVL aircraft was decided against early in the Australian procurement process due to cost and detraction from the ship's main role, redesigning the ship to remove the ramp would have added unnecessary cost to the project. The retention of the <b>ski-jump</b> has prompted multiple recommendations that fixed-wing aircraft be operated from the ships (primarily envisaged as a flight group of F-35B Lightning II STOVL aircraft). The RAN has maintained that embarking Australian-operated, fixed-wing aircraft was not under consideration, although has conceded that cross-decking with other nations' aircraft could possibly occur. In May 2014, Minister for Defence David Johnston stated in media interviews {{that the government was}} considering acquiring F-35B fighters for the Canberras, and Prime Minister Tony Abbott instructed 2015 Defence White Paper planners to consider the option of embarking F-35B squadrons aboard the two ships. This assessment found that the cost of modifying the ships to operate jets would be very high, and the idea was rejected before the completion of the White Paper.|$|E

25|$|Opponents to {{operating}} F-35s {{from the}} Canberra-class state that embarking enough aircraft {{to be an}} effective force would require abandoning their capability as amphibious warfare vessels, operating as an aircraft carrier would make the ships higher profile targets and need greater escorting forces, existing fuel and ordnance storage {{would not be able to}} sustain fixed-wing operations, structural modifications were needed to reinforce and heat-treat the flight deck to withstand F-35B vertical thrust, and the F-35B project itself has been the most expensive and most problematic of the three Joint Strike Fighter variants. Supporters counter that providing fixed-wing air support close to amphibious operations maximises aircraft capability, other nations are already working on solutions to structural and thrust problems for other Harrier-era ships, and the presence of a <b>ski-jump</b> makes the vessels already more suitable for STOVL operations than equivalent amphibious ships with flat flight decks.|$|E
25|$|In August 2014, the Chinese-language Shanghai Morning Post listed that Liaoning {{would carry}} 36 aircraft: 24 Shenyang J-15 fighters, six Changhe Z-18F anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters, four Changhe Z-18J {{airborne}} early warning helicopters and two Harbin Z-9C rescue helicopters. The Chinese carrier aircraft inventory {{is similar to a}} balanced combat and support aircraft approach intended for Soviet aircraft carriers, which supported nuclear submarines, large surface combatants, and land-based strike bombers performing anti-access roles. The air wing lacks long-range radar and anti-submarine fixed-wing aircraft, needing support from shore-based aircraft such as Tupolev Tu-154 ASW and Shaanxi Y-8 AWACS aircraft. The U.S. Department of Defense noted that J-15s will have below normal range and armament when operating from the carrier, due to limits imposed by the <b>ski-jump</b> takeoff system. The lack of a carrier onboard delivery aircraft like the United States Navy (USN) Grumman C-2 Greyhound also limits logistics capabilities. Liaoning would need extensive land-based support to oppose a USN carrier strike group; however, it would be potent against the Vietnam People's Navy and the Philippine Navy. Deficiencies will likely be corrected with future aircraft carriers, which are expected to be larger with conventional takeoff decks and catapult launching for heavier fighters, plus fixed-wing radar and anti-submarine patrol aircraft.|$|E
