40|$|The Wescor Dew Point Microvoltmeter, Model HR 33 T, {{together}} with a Wescor C- 52 sample chamber, {{was used to measure}} water activities between aw 1. 0 and aw 0. 60. Because of temperature gradient problems, the sample chamber was mounted in a styrofoam insulation box constructed so that the chamber could be opened and the sample replaced while it remained inside the closed insulation box. The standard psychrometric procedure was used for samples with a w between 1 and 0. 94. A modified procedure was used for <b>samples</b> <b>dryer</b> than a 0. 94. The sample chamber was first loaded with water, and water was condensed on the thermocouple. The water was then replaced by sliding the sample into the chamber, and the psychrometric cooling of the thermocouple measured. The procedure was calibrated with a series of salt solutions and saturated salt slurries of known aw, and was used to measure aw of a variety of foods. Four subsample determinations were made on from 8 to 23 separate days of the foods or standards. Typical water activity mean and standard deviation values were : milk chocolate bar. 60 ~. 035; corn syrup sol ids. 60 _I_. 019; nonfat dry milk. 7 5 +. 017; cashews. 75 ±. 021; sunflower seeds. 75 ±. 022; orange juice concentrate. 80 ±. 026; whey concentrate. 83 ±. 030; chocolate fudge sauce. 85 ±. 028; Cheddar cheese. 95 ±. 026; salami. 96 ±. 019; Swiss cheese. 9 6 ±. 019; processed cheese spread. 96 ±. 023; Gouda cheese. 99 ±. 041; and soy sauce. 98 ±. 019. The coefficient of variations ranged from 1. 9 to 5. 8 %. Accuracy of the instrument was good in that the a values varied only s = ±. 03 for the literature values for various foods. No fouling of the detector occurred when powders were evaluated. Analysis time was 5 min for samples over aw 0. 94 and 10 min for low aw samples. The Wescor instrument appeared to be rapid, economical, and to have good repeatability...|$|R

Controlled drying may solve {{most of the problems}} encountered in sun drying. Apricot fruits of five Italian cultivars underwent hot air drying in a tangential air-flow cabinet <b>dryer.</b> <b>Sampling</b> was done {{at the beginning and end}} of the process and at regular intervals throughout, to calculate drying curves and quality loss. Results showed that mild drying temperatures led to slow drying kinetics, although pre-treatments reduced drying time to a certain extent. Pre-treatments resulted in good colour maintenance during the process, without trespassing legal limits of SO 2 in the pulp, and microbial stability was excellent.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the microbiological characteristics of air blown from warm air hand dryers, and to compare findings with the microbiological characteristics of indoor air in which the <b>dryer</b> settled. Air <b>samples</b> was taken from different public places (shopping centers, restaurants and hospitals) and investigated for total viable counts, coagulase negative Staphylococcus, E.

40|$|The {{dehydration}} {{of fruit}} from fig trees is normally achieved by sun drying. There is {{concern about the}} safety of the end product, mainly because there is a risk of the development of aflatoxins. These concerns can be overcome by artificial drying (oven dehydration). Fig fruits of a local cultivar, which were either pre-treated by blanching or blanching plus sulphuring or not treated at all, underwent hot air dehydration under mild processing conditions in a pilot airflow cabinet <b>dryer.</b> <b>Sampling</b> was carried out at regular intervals to calculate the rate of dehydration and assess quality changes. Microbiological counts and nonenzymatic browning were also monitored. Pretreatments resulted in a shorter processing time, compared with control fruits.

40|$|Recovery {{rates of}} certain polar and {{non-polar}} {{volatile organic compounds}} were evaluated for bias {{associated with the use}} of a Nafion® dryer in the analyses of environmental <b>samples.</b> Analyses of <b>dryer</b> inlet verses dryer outlet concentrations of specific compounds were used to assess the extent of Nafion® bias. A select group of 22 polar and 6 non-polar compounds, as well as historical data from other authors was used to develop a stepwise multiple regression model to aid in predicting recovery rates. Specific compound physical parameters used in this model include water solubility, hydrogen bonding capacity, and dipole moment. The overall R squared or predictive value of this model is 0. 7885. Typical recovery rates of non-polar and extremely polar compounds are 100 % and < 10 % respectively.

40|$|The raw {{material}} freshness and drying methods are determining factors of fish meal quality. The {{aim of this}} experiment was to study {{the effect of the}} drying method and {{raw material}} freshness as for its functional properties in fish meal. Blue whiting, herring and capelin meals produced in commercial fish meal processing plants in Iceland were obtained. The samples were categorized (according to the freshness of raw fish and processing technique) into three grades (low temperature (LT), Norsea Mink (NSM) and standard). Freshness of raw material was assessed through the total volatile nitrogen content in fish before process. Fish meals were dried using air dryers (Dyno and Hetland) and steam <b>dryers.</b> <b>Samples</b> were tested for proximate composition, including salt content, unbound ammonia, water activity, bulk density, flow characteristics, particle size and some functional properties (viscosity, water holding capacity and solubility).

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was carried out, using {{standard}} techniques, to identify and count the bacterial contamination of hand air dryers, used in washrooms. Bacteria were isolated from the air flow, outlet nozzle of warm air dryers in fifteen air dryers used in these washrooms. Bacteria {{were found to be}} relatively numerous in the air flows. Bacterially contaminated air was found to be emitted whenever a warm air dryer was running, even when not being used for hand drying. Our investigation shows that Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, Bacillus cereus and Brevundimonad diminuta/vesicularis were emitted from all of the <b>dryers</b> <b>sampled,</b> with 95 % showing evidence of the presence of the potential pathogen S. haemolyticus. It is concluded that hot air dryers can deposit pathogenic bacteria onto the hands and body of users. Bacteria are distributed into the general environment whenever dryers are running and could be inhaled by users and none-users alike. The results provide an evidence base for the development and enhancement of hygienic hand drying practices...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} on the organoleptic, biochemical and bacteriological aspects of three dried fish products produced from two different model of low cost solar tunnel dryer. The overall quality of the products obtained from both dryers was excellent. Sixty minutes soaking showed the maximum water reconstitution of the products with values between 66. 82 to 75. 28 % and 71. 98 to 78. 09 % in dryer 1 & 2 respectively. The highest reconstitution was obtained from Silver Jew fish (75. 28 - 78. 09 %) and lowest from Bombay duck (66. 86 - 71. 98 %) from both dryers. The average moisture, protein, lipid and ash content of the dried products were 11. 8 - 15. 0 %, 57. 32 - 68. 49 %, 6. 08 - 8. 62 % and 12. 25 - 14. 88 % respectively in fish in dryer 1 and dryer 2.

40|$|High airflow hand dryers {{are found}} in many public restrooms today. These dryers offer quick and clean hand drying, and are seen as being an {{environment-friendly}} alternative to paper towels. However, many new hand dryers are loud, exposing individuals using the facilities {{as well as those}} employees who clean the facilities to potentially dangerous noise. Prolonged exposure to high levels of occupational noise can cause damage to hair cells in the cochlea, resulting in varying degrees of noise-induced hearing loss. This study examined the intensity (in dBA) of the noise produced by the air dryers in campus restrooms. Hand dryer peak and average noise was measured with a sound level meter at 2. 5 ft, 5 ft, and 10 ft from the dryer. Noise measurements did not decrease as predicted by the inverse-square law, probably because of the reverberative surfaces found in the restrooms. The small <b>sample</b> of hand <b>dryers</b> tested was mostly found to be producing more noise than the manufacturer claimed they would; indeed, none of the dryers would be safe for an 8 -h workday exposure. While hand dryers do reduce paper trash, they pose as a different sort of hazard to our environment and population...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Higher {{atmospheric}} CO 2 concentration {{may influence}} positively plant production once the substrate for photosynthesis and gradient increase between the ambient air and mesophyll cells. Plants respond {{not only to}} change in surrounding CO 2 concentration, but to modifications of their micro-environment. Modelling approach was applied to investigate the relation of plants and some elements of microclimate to increased CO 2 levels. Other influences of global warming {{included in the study}} indirectly by running warmer and <b>dryer</b> <b>sample</b> days than the average measured locally during the past decades. Depending on growth in CO 2 concentration increases in inside canopy air temperatures were between 0. 12 and 0. 37 °C. The warmer plants could have less effective transpiration cooling resulted from higher stomatal resistances. It decreased the water vapour pressure of the air inside the plant stand. In spite of partly stomatal closure, abundant carbon-dioxide concentration raised the intensity of photosynthesis. However if elevated CO 2 concentration takes place, the other additional influencing factors as warming, change in precipitation amount and its distribution, plant adaptation processes etc. may offset the production benefits of increasing level of CO 2. More detailed investigations are needed to complete our imaginations about future consequences of possible climate variations, mainly in local level...|$|R

Dried pulverized kernel <b>samples</b> from each <b>dryer</b> were tested for basic quality parameters, taking desiccated coconut samples as the control according to Sri Lankan standards. Storability of dried pulverized kernel samples {{was carried out by}} taking desiccated coconut samples as the control under the standard packaging material. Basic quality parameters of charcoal obtained from the gasifier were tested with charcoal made using pit method as the control according to Sri Lankan standards. The basic quality was same in all fresh dried pulverized kernel samples. Aerobic plate counts of fresh dried pulverized kernel samples exceeded the critical limit. During storage, moisture absorption was same in all samples while free fatty acid content and aerobic plate count of dried pulverized kernel samples were greater than desiccated coconut. Quality parameters of all charcoal samples were within the standard limits except particle size of charcoal made using the gasifier.

40|$|Microorganisms behind {{ceramic tiles}} in {{bathrooms}} In this study {{the interface between}} the backside of ceramic tiles and the waterproof membrane was investigated for microbial growth in 13 bathrooms. This interface {{is made up of}} the backside of the ceramic tile, tile adhesive and the waterproof membrane. In every day used bathrooms water will accumulate in this particular environment. It is calculated that a tiled wall exposed to water in 15 minutes needs approximately six months to dry out since water is sucked, by capillary actions, through the grout joints between the ceramic tiles. The wall dries through diffusion forces and diffusion force is a weaker than capillary force and therefore the drying need longer time than the wetting of the wall with a water accumulation in the interface as a result. Samples were taken from areas where the wall and floor had been exposed to free water regularly, due to showering. Mould and/or bacterial growth was found on 69 % of the analysed specimens from the most water exposed places in the bathrooms. No such growth was found on the <b>samples</b> from the <b>dryer</b> areas. The results shows that although the environment behind the tiles may seem to disadvantaged for microbial growth, due to a limited amount of organic substances and due to pH values not favourable for microbial growth, such growth is possible when the moisture conditions are high. To our knowledge the microbial occurrence in this particular environment has not been investigated before...|$|R

A survey was carried out to obtain baseline data on levels of aflatoxin in peanuts from major production regions in western Kenya. A total of 384 and 385 samples from Busia and Homabay districts, respectively, were obtained and analyzed for aflatoxin content with an indirect competitive ELISA protocol. Levels of aflatoxin ranged from 0 to 2688 and 7525 μg/kg in samples from Busia and Homa Bay, respectively. Of 769 samples, 87. 01 % contained b 4 μg/kg of aflatoxin, 5. 45 % were in the range ≥ 4 and 20 μg/kg, while 7. 54 % exceeded the Kenya's regulatory limit of 20 μg/kg. There was a highly significant (χ 2 = 14. 17; Pb 0. 0002) association between district of origin and sample aflatoxin levels. This observation was supported by a significant (χ 2 = 11. 98; P= 0. 0005) association between levels of aflatoxin and agro ecological zones. Only 3. 26 % of the <b>samples</b> from the <b>dryer</b> LM 3 zone had N 20 μg/kg compared with 10. 28 % of the samples from the wetter and humid LM 1 zone. There was also a highly significant (χ 2 = 9. 73; P= 0. 0018) association between cultivar improvement status and aflatoxin levels. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the odds for peanuts from Busia being contaminated were 2. 6 times greater than those for peanuts from Homabay. Planting improved cultivars would lower the odds of contamination to a half (odds ratio= 0. 552) those for local landraces.
