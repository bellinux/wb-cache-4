He likes using magic to surprise others, such as making flowers and small birds appear out of nowhere. His <b>sacrifice</b> <b>for</b> magic is that he ages quickly. For example, when Misaki was saved by him, she was surprised he had aged a few years in one day.|$|E
5|$|As Bryan spoke {{his final}} sentence, recalling the Crucifixion of Jesus, {{he placed his}} hands to his temples, fingers {{extended}}; with the final words, he extended his arms to his sides straight out to his body and held that pose for about five seconds as if offering himself as <b>sacrifice</b> <b>for</b> the cause, as the audience watched in dead silence. He then lowered them, descended from the podium, and began to head back to his seat as the stillness held.|$|E
5|$|The Home {{opened its}} doors in 1923. It was built as a diocesan {{memorial}} to the Coloured men who paid the ultimate <b>sacrifice</b> <b>for</b> their country. It was run by the Anglican Nuns, the Order of St Margaret, East Grinstead who remained in charge until 1978 when they left South Africa in protest against apartheid. The Main Block, Boys' House and Priests' House were designed by the diocesan architect F.L.H. Flemming. The Church successfully opposed removal of the Home because the property was on farm land and {{not part of a}} proclaimed township.|$|E

5|$|Three major {{theological}} controversies {{occurred during}} Manuel's reign. In 1156–1157 {{the question was}} raised whether Christ had offered himself as a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>for</b> {{the sins of the}} world to the Father and to the Holy Spirit only, or also to the Logos (i.e., to himself). In the end a synod held at Constantinople in 1157 adopted a compromise formula, that the Word made flesh offered a double sacrifice to the Holy Trinity, despite the dissidence of Patriarch of Antioch-elect Soterichus Panteugenus.|$|E
5|$|Women {{were usually}} {{identified}} as victims during the independence wars since {{the women of}} Latin America were forced to <b>sacrifice</b> <b>for</b> the cause. The ideals of womanhood meant that women must sacrifice what the situation required such as a mother sacrificing her son or a virgin knowing she might be sacrificing motherhood or marriage due {{to the loss of}} many young men. This view meant that women were meant to contribute to independence in a supportive role while leaving the combat and politics {{in the hands of the}} men.|$|E
5|$|His {{behaviour}} {{on campaign}} {{can only be}} described as perfectly honourable and at times humane, a trait which was illustrated during the French Revolutionary Wars, when he spared no effort to protect captured émigrés from the wrath of the Revolutionary radicals in the army. He also showed respect for occupied populations and never tolerated pillaging nor violence from his men. As a sign a gratitude, he was offered gifts several times but he was often seen refusing and sending them back. While on campaign in Tyrol, he was recorded to have accepted a large sum of money but he immediately distributed it to the local hospitals. Further evidence of his humanity was the care that he displayed for the lives and well-being of his men, whom he was always reluctant to <b>sacrifice</b> <b>for</b> the sake of glory.|$|E

5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, the {{doctrine}} of the Lord's Supper became a point of controversy between American Reformed theologians John Williamson Nevin and Charles Hodge. Nevin, influenced by German Lutheran Isaak August Dorner, wrote that through the Lord's Supper, Christians are mystically united to Christ's whole person, and that this union is through Christ's flesh. Hodge thought that Nevin overemphasized the idea of mystical union, and argued that when Christians are said to commune with Christ in the Supper, it is Christ's virtue as a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>for</b> their sins which is meant rather than a mystical union with his flesh. Hodge also taught that nothing is communicated in the Lord's Supper which is not communicated in the preaching of God's word. American Presbyterians generally agreed with Hodge. Nineteenth-century Reformed Congregationalist followers of the New England theology generally held a symbolic, memorial view of the Supper.|$|E
5|$|Life {{magazine}} {{covered the}} deaths of the men with a photo essay, including photographs by Cornell Capa and some taken by the five men before their deaths. The ensuing worldwide publicity gave several missionary organizations significant more visibility, especially in the United States and Latin America. Most notable among these was the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), the organization for which both Elisabeth Elliot and Rachel Saint worked. Because of the martyrdom of her brother, Saint considered herself spiritually bonded to the Huaorani, believing that what she saw as his <b>sacrifice</b> <b>for</b> the Huaorani was symbolic of Christ's death for the salvation of humanity. In 1957, Saint and her Huaorani companion Dayuma toured across the United States and appeared on the television show This Is Your Life. The two also appeared in a Billy Graham crusade in New York City, contributing to Saint's increasing popularity among evangelical Christians and generating significant monetary donations for SIL.|$|E

5|$|The Antemoro figure {{among the}} more recent {{settlers}} {{on the island of}} Madagascar. They are descended from Muslim seafarers who are believed to have arrived on the southeast coast around 1500. Boats carrying Muslim settlers had arrived on Madagascar's shores in the past, but there was a marked uptick in arrivals around this time. Upon arrival they encountered several other Malagasy ethnic groups including the Zafiraminia, who also traced their origins back to Mecca by way of East Africa, although some scholars suggest that the origins of the Zafiraminia was in Sumatra and who had developed a high status among Malagasy communities for the knowledge and technology they had carried with them from overseas, and who had the prerogative of practicing ritual animal <b>sacrifice</b> <b>for</b> the ancestors (sombili), a highly powerful and important rite among Malagasy communities. Oral and written historical traditions of the Antemoro describe their desire to secure marriages between the two communities, but these efforts were rejected by the Zafiraminia. A conflict developed between the two groups for supremacy, which the oral histories of other Malagasy groups describe as a battle between two giants. The conflict evolved as additional Arab settlers arrived and joined with their fellow newcomers to become Antemoro themselves.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} this, Morris started {{the new season}} consistently, scoring four fifties in his first five innings, {{including}} 55 and 39 in his state's victory over the touring South Africans ahead of the Tests. The on-field action against the South Africans brought no immediate upturn in Morris' Test fortunes. He made only one half-century {{and a total of}} 149 runs in the first three Tests as Australia took the series lead 2–1. In the Second Test, he had progressed to 42 when he drove Hugh Tayfield into a close fielder. The ball ballooned to mid-off and Tayfield ran back and dived parallel to the ball's trajectory and caught it. By the standards of the era, the catch was regarded as miraculous. He ended the series strongly, with 77 in the second innings of the Fourth Test in Adelaide, before making his best performances of 99 and 44 in Melbourne in the Fifth Test, which Australia lost by six wickets. Morris' 99 occurred when he was involved in a mix-up while batting with debutant Ian Craig, Australia's youngest ever Test cricketer. Morris decided to sacrifice his wicket for Craig's in a run out. His action meant that he had not scored a Test century for two years, and would have to wait another two years to reach the milestone again. Morris was widely praised for his unselfishness and his <b>sacrifice</b> <b>for</b> his new teammate. He ended the series with 370 runs at 41.11 and took his maiden Test wicket in Adelaide, that of John Watkins. The series ended 2–2, the first Test series in Morris' career that Australia had not won. Morris ended the season with 105 in a warm-up match before the tour of England and totalled 913 runs at 45.65 for the summer.|$|E
