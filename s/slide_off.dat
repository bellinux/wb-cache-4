5|$|The chase {{involving}} the double-decker bus was filmed with a second-hand London bus adapted {{by having a}} top section removed, and then placed back in situ running on ball bearings {{to allow it to}} <b>slide</b> <b>off</b> on impact. The stunts {{involving the}} bus were performed by Maurice Patchett, a London Transport bus driving instructor.|$|E
5|$|The dies are {{designed}} so that the finished casting will <b>slide</b> <b>off</b> the cover half of the die {{and stay in the}} ejector half as the dies are opened. This assures that the casting will be ejected every cycle because the ejector half contains the ejector pins to push the casting out of that die half. The ejector pins are driven by an ejector pin plate, which accurately drives all of the pins {{at the same time and}} with the same force, so that the casting is not damaged. The ejector pin plate also retracts the pins after ejecting the casting to prepare for the next shot. There must be enough ejector pins to keep the overall force on each pin low, because the casting is still hot and can be damaged by excessive force. The pins still leave a mark, so they must be located in places where these marks will not hamper the casting's purpose.|$|E
25|$|The upper {{panel in}} the image at right shows a ball in {{circular}} motion on a banked curve. The curve is banked at an angle θ from the horizontal, and {{the surface of the}} road is considered to be slippery. The objective is to find what angle the bank must have so the ball does not <b>slide</b> <b>off</b> the road. Intuition tells us that, on a flat curve with no banking at all, the ball will simply <b>slide</b> <b>off</b> the road; while with a very steep banking, the ball will slide to the center unless it travels the curve rapidly.|$|E

25|$|Secondly, he {{recommended}} that the extrados of the barrel of an arch of great obliquity be formed into rusticated steps so as to provide a horizontal bed for the spandrel walls in order to overcome their tendency to <b>slide</b> <b>off</b> the arch barrel.|$|E
25|$|Once the roughout shape was created, {{a further}} phase of flaking was {{undertaken}} {{to make the}} tool thinner. The thinning flakes were removed using a softer hammer, such as bone or antler. The softer hammer required more careful preparation of the striking platform {{and this would be}} abraded using a coarse stone to ensure the hammer did not <b>slide</b> <b>off</b> when struck.|$|E
25|$|November 29, 1949: American Airlines Flight 157, a Douglas DC-6, was {{on final}} {{approach}} to Runway 36 when {{the flight crew}} lost control, causing the airliner to <b>slide</b> <b>off</b> the runway and strike a parked airplane, a hangar, and a flight school before crashing into a business {{across the street from}} the airport. 26 passengers and two flight attendants died in the crash and ensuing fire; the pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer, and 15 others survived.|$|E

25|$|The opening laps saw cars <b>slide</b> <b>off</b> the circuit, but {{he would}} never get the choice to join the chaos, as his fuel {{injection}} system failed on the very first lap. In fact the entire Japanese contingent suffered a dreadful race, especially when both Katayama and rookie Taki Inoue then aquaplaned into the pit wall {{at the end of}} lap three in separate incidents. Within the first few minutes all the local heroes were out of the race.|$|E
25|$|Emergency {{services}} and fire engines were standing {{by on the}} LAX tarmac ahead of the landing. Although foam trucks were available, they were not used. The U.S. FAA no longer recommends pre-foaming runways, chiefly due to concerns that it would deplete firefighting foam supplies which might later be needed {{to respond to a}} fire; it is also difficult to determine exactly where a runway should be foamed, and pre-foaming might also reduce the effectiveness of the aircraft's brakes, potentially causing it to <b>slide</b> <b>off</b> the runway.|$|E
25|$|In general, the stirrup {{is placed}} on the ball of the foot, {{allowing}} the rider to let his weight flow down the back of the leg into the heel by way of the flexible ankle. This provides the rider {{with the support of the}} stirrup while still allowing for him to easily absorb the shock of the horse's motion. If the stirrup is too far forward, on the toes, the rider risks losing if he pushes with too much pressure (forcing it off the foot) or too little (allowing it to simply <b>slide</b> <b>off).</b>|$|E

25|$|The staff sling, {{also known}} as the stave sling, fustibalus (Latin), fustibale (French), {{consists}} of a staff (a length of wood) with a short sling at one end. One cord of the sling is firmly attached to the stave and the other end has a loop that can <b>slide</b> <b>off</b> and release the projectile. Staff slings are extremely powerful because the stave can be made as long as two meters, creating a powerful lever. Ancient art shows slingers holding staff slings by one end, with the pocket behind them, and using both hands to throw the staves forward over their heads.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the second}} championship-deciding {{collision}} in two years, Jackie Stewart interviewed Senna at the 1990 Australian Grand Prix (where Senna won pole and led for 61 laps before gearbox trouble {{forced him to}} <b>slide</b> <b>off</b> into a tyre barrier) and brought up a number of controversial collisions in which Senna had been involved {{over the last few}} years, stating that Senna had made more contact with other cars and drivers {{in the last four years}} than all the champions before him. An irritated Senna questioned how someone like Stewart, himself a triple world champion, could ask questions like he did, knowing the pressure under which drivers raced.|$|E
25|$|Another {{failure occurs}} when the fill at each end moves (through {{resonant}} effects) in bulk, in opposite directions. If there is an insufficient founding shelf for the overpass, then it may fall. Additional shelf and ductile stays may be added to attach the overpass to the footings at one or both ends. The stays, rather than being fixed to the beams, may instead be clamped to them. Under moderate loading, these keep the overpass centered in the gap {{so that it is}} less likely to <b>slide</b> <b>off</b> its founding shelf at one end. The ability for the fixed ends to slide, rather than break, will prevent the complete drop of the structure if it should fail to remain on the footings.|$|E
5000|$|On November 9, 2007 an Iberia Airbus A340-600, {{registration}} EC-JOH, {{was badly}} damaged after <b>sliding</b> <b>off</b> the runway at Old Mariscal Sucre International Airport. No injuries were reported. According to Airbus, the aircraft was written-off.|$|R

25|$|April 14, 1993: The {{pilot of}} American Airlines Flight 102, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, {{registration}} number N139AA, lost directional control during a crosswind landing in rainy conditions and caused the jetliner to <b>slide</b> <b>off</b> runway 17L after arriving from Honolulu, Hawaii. The craft dug into deep mud alongside the runway, collapsing the {{nose landing gear}} and tearing off the left-hand engine {{and much of the}} left wing. A fire in the left-hand wheel well was rapidly extinguished by firefighters who arrived almost immediately from the nearby DFW/DPS Fire Station. 2 passengers suffered serious injuries while using the evacuation slides to escape from the steeply tilted fuselage; the remaining 187 passengers and all 13 crew evacuated in relative safety, but the aircraft was a total loss.|$|E
25|$|The PIT {{begins when}} the {{pursuing}} vehicle pulls alongside the fleeing vehicle {{so that the}} portion of the pursuer's vehicle forward of the front wheels is aligned with {{the portion of the}} target vehicle behind the back wheels. The pursuer gently makes contact with the target's side, then steers sharply into the target. The pursuer must also accelerate or its bumper will <b>slide</b> <b>off</b> of the target vehicle. As soon as the fleeing vehicle's rear tires lose traction and start to skid, the pursuer continues to turn in the same direction until clear of the target. This is more of a committed lane change than an actual turn. The target will turn in the opposite direction, in front of the pursuer, and will spin out. The PIT may be done from either side, but consideration must be given to where both cars will end up.|$|E
25|$|Notification Center {{was added}} in the {{operating}} system. It {{provides an overview of}} alerts from applications and displays notifications until the user completes an associated action, rather than requiring instant resolution. Users may choose what applications appear in Notification Center, and how they are handled. There are three types of notifications: banners, alerts, and badges. Banners are displayed {{for a short period of}} time in the upper right corner of the Mac's screen, and then <b>slide</b> <b>off</b> to the right. The icon of the application is displayed on the left side of the banner, while the message from the application will be displayed on the right side. Alerts are the same as banners, but will not disappear from the screen until the user takes action. Badges are red notification icons that are displayed on the application's icon. They indicate the number of items available for the application.|$|E
5000|$|On November 9, 2007 an Iberia Airbus A340-600, {{registration}} EC-JOH, {{was badly}} damaged at Quito, Ecuador after <b>sliding</b> <b>off</b> the runway at Old Mariscal Sucre International Airport. No injuries were reported. According to Airbus, the aircraft was written-off.|$|R

25|$|Heavy rain {{continued}} {{to affect the}} track in the Saturday free practice sessions and several drivers spun off on the slippery surface and onto the run-off areas on the circuit. Michael Schumacher set the pace in the third practice session with a lap of 1:31.430. Frentzen was second-quickest, three-tenths of a second off Michael Schumacher's pace. The McLaren pairing of Häkkinen and Coulthard had {{the third and fourth}} fastest times respectively. Barrichello set the fifth-fastest time, ahead of Heidfeld in sixth and Trulli in seventh. Ralf Schumacher, Panis and Montoya followed in the top ten. Villeneuve was unable to record a lap time because his car had a gearbox problem causing him to stop at the exit of the pit lane. More rain fell in-between {{the end of the third}} practice session and the start of the fourth and final practice sessions. This meant drivers were unable to improve on their lap times and {{continued to}} <b>slide</b> <b>off</b> the track onto the circuit's run-off areas. Michael Schumacher remained the fastest driver with Frentzen the second fastest driver. Häkkinen and Coulthard remained the third and fourth quickest drivers, with Barrichello fifth and Heidfeld sixth. Trulli, Räikkönen (who took evasive action to avoid a collision with a hare which had breached circuit perimeters), Panis and Ralf Schumacher completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
500|$|Sangay {{developed}} in three distinct phases. Its oldest edifice, formed between 500,000 and 250,000 years ago, is evidenced today {{by a wide}} scattering of material opening to the east, defined by a crest about [...] high. This first Sangay, pockmarked by secondary ridges, {{is thought to have}} been [...] in diameter, with a summit located [...] southeast of the present summit. The curved shape of the remnants of this first structure indicates that it suffered a massive flank collapse, scattering the nearby forest lowlands with debris and causing a large part of its southern caldera wall to <b>slide</b> <b>off</b> the mountain, forming an embayment lower on its slopes. This [...] thick block, the best preserved specimen of Sangay's early construction, consists of sequentially layered breccias, pyroclastic flows, and lahar deposits. Acidic andesites with just under 60% silicon dioxide dominate these flows, but more basic andesites can be found as well.|$|E
500|$|NME {{music critic}} Mark Beaumont {{believed}} that Jackson [...] "starts banging creepily on about" [...] the lyrics which pertain to saving the children. Frank Kogan of the Village Voice noted that while [...] "Cry" [...] and another song from Invincible ("Speechless") are [...] "very pretty", {{they give the}} impression that Jackson's [...] "standing sideways, so as to let the beauty <b>slide</b> <b>off</b> him." [...] Los Angeles Times staff writer Robert Hilburn wrote that the track [...] "fills the social commentary role" [...] of Jackson's [...] "Man in the Mirror" [...] (1988), while Hartford Courant rock music critic Roger Catlin believed that the single is a redux to Jackson's [...] "Heal the World" [...] (1991). Newsday staff writer Glenn Gamboa said that the song was [...] "equally average" [...] to other tracks on Invincible. James Hunter of Rolling Stone magazine wrote that R. Kelly [...] "more or less succeeds with the kind of life affirming number" [...] on the single.|$|E
