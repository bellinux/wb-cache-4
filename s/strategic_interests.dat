5|$|In {{the later}} {{part of the}} nineteenth century, the {{emphasis}} of Imperial defence policy had shifted from a single centralised Army and Navy to an approach whereby the self-governing Dominions began to provide forces for their own defence, and to begin {{to take responsibility for}} <b>strategic</b> <b>interests</b> and bases in their own geographic areas. The culmination of this was the South African War, where contingents from the Dominion militaries had played a significant role.|$|E
5|$|The European Council on Foreign Relations {{and analysts}} suggest the Eurasian Union {{includes}} <b>strategic</b> <b>interests</b> {{as well as}} economic interests for its member states, especially Russia. In order to link both Europe and East Asia, Russia seeks to develop its eastern regions to increase its access to Asian markets. Russia’s Far East has gained even more importance due to its proximity to alternative markets since the European Union and United States imposed sanctions on Russia following the crisis in Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|The Belgians much {{preferred}} {{an alliance}} with the United Kingdom. The British had entered the First World War {{in response to the}} German violation of Belgian neutrality. The Belgian Channel ports had offered the German Imperial Navy valuable bases, and such an attack would offer the German Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe bases to engage in strategic offensive operations against the United Kingdom in the coming conflict. But the British government paid little attention to the concerns of the Belgians. The lack of this commitment ensured the Belgian withdrawal from the Western Alliance, the day before the remilitarisation of the Rhineland. The lack of opposition to the remilitarisation served to convince the Belgians that France and Britain were unwilling to fight for their own <b>strategic</b> <b>interests,</b> let alone Belgium's. The Belgian General Staff was determined to fight for its own interests, alone if necessary.|$|E

Paul Kruger, {{one of the}} leaders of the uprising, became President of the ZAR in 1883. Meanwhile, the British, who viewed their defeat at Majuba as an aberration, forged ahead with their desire to federate the Southern African colonies and republics. They saw this as the best way to come to terms with the fact of a white Afrikaner majority, as well as to promote their larger <b>strategic</b> <b>interests</b> in the area.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though the}} two {{countries}} share some common <b>strategic</b> <b>interests,</b> India and Iran differ significantly on key foreign policy issues. India has expressed strong opposition against Iran's nuclear programme and whilst both the nations continue to oppose the Taliban, India supports the presence of NATO forces in Afghanistan unlike Iran. Iran is the second largest supplier of crude oil to India, supplying more than 425,000 barrels of oil per day, and consequently India {{is one of the}} largest foreign investors in Iran's oil and gas industry.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to explicit wars, the Soviet military {{took part in}} a number of internal conflicts in various countries, as well as proxy wars between third countries as a means of advancing their <b>strategic</b> <b>interests</b> while avoiding direct conflict between the superpowers in the nuclear age (or, {{in the case of the}} Spanish Civil War, avoiding a direct conflict with Nazi Germany at a time when neither side was prepared for such a war). In many cases, involvement was in the form of military advisors as well as the sale or provision of weapons.|$|E

This would enable rapid deployment of troops to the Gulf, then the forward line of defence for British interests in India, and protect against invasion from the north by Russia. A land bridge was also {{an alternative to the}} Suez Canal.|$|E

A military training agreement with Asunción, giving immunity to US soldiers, caused some concern after media reports initially reported that a base housing 20,000 US soldiers was being built at Mariscal Estigarribia within 200km of Argentina and Bolivia, and 300km of Brazil, near an airport which could receive large planes (B-52, C-130 Hercules, etc.) which the Paraguayan Air Force does not have. a present, no more than 400 U.S. troops are expected.|$|E

30|$|A {{number of}} {{commentators}} erroneously {{subscribe to the}} notion that the US has very limited <b>strategic</b> <b>interest</b> in Sri Lanka. Jeffrey Lunstead (2011) for example points out that “the degree of engagement and commitment of US attention to the Sri Lankan peace process since it began in late 2001 has been out of proportion to US interest in Sri Lanka, where the US has no significant <b>strategic</b> interests.…US military <b>interest</b> in Sri Lanka is minimal” (p. 54). The problem with this approach is that it looks at Sri Lanka’s significance to the US in isolation. Sri Lanka is not only a South Asian state but also located in a strategically significant space in the Indian Ocean. That is why this research argues that American <b>strategic</b> <b>interest</b> in Sri Lanka should be examined through its policies and purposes both in South Asia as a region and the Indian Ocean.|$|R
