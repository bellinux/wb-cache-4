5|$|Bridging wires are rods that couple {{together}} resonators {{that are}} not adjacent. They {{can be used to}} produce poles of attenuation in the <b>stopband.</b> This has the benefit of increasing the <b>stopband</b> rejection. When the pole is placed near the passband edge, it also has the benefit of increasing roll-off and narrowing the transition band. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11. Bridging across a single resonator (figure 11b) can produce a pole of attenuation in the high <b>stopband.</b> Bridging across two resonators (figure 11c) can produce a pole of attenuation in both the high and the low <b>stopband.</b> Using multiple bridges (figure 11d) will result in multiple poles of attenuation. In this way, the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range.|$|E
5|$|A Chebyshev {{response}} {{simultaneously in}} the passband and <b>stopband</b> is possible, such as Cauer's equal ripple elliptic filter.|$|E
5|$|A {{more complex}} example of stepped {{impedance}} design {{is presented in}} figure 6. Again, narrow lines are used to implement inductors and wide lines correspond to capacitors, but in this case, the lumped-element counterpart has resonators connected in shunt across the main line. This topology {{can be used to}} design elliptical filters or Chebyshev filters with poles of attenuation in the <b>stopband.</b> However, calculating component values for these structures is an involved process and has led to designers often choosing to implement them as m-derived filters instead, which perform well and are much easier to calculate. The purpose of incorporating resonators is to improve the <b>stopband</b> rejection. However, beyond the resonant frequency of the highest frequency resonator, the <b>stopband</b> rejection starts to deteriorate as the resonators are moving towards open-circuit. For this reason, filters built to this design often have an additional single stepped-impedance capacitor as the final element of the filter. This also ensures good rejection at high frequency.|$|E

5|$|Elliptic {{filters are}} filters {{produced}} by the insertion-loss method which use elliptic rational functions in their transfer function as an approximation to the ideal filter response {{and the result is}} called a Chebyshev approximation. This is the same Chebyshev approximation technique used by Cauer on image filters but follows the Darlington insertion-loss design method and uses slightly different elliptic functions. Cauer had some contact with Darlington and Bell Labs before WWII (for a time he worked in the US) but during the war they worked independently, in some cases making the same discoveries. Cauer had disclosed the Chebyshev approximation to Bell Labs but had not left them with the proof. Sergei Schelkunoff provided this and a generalisation to all equal ripple problems. Elliptic filters are a general class of filter which incorporate several other important classes as special cases: Cauer filter (equal ripple in passband and <b>stopband),</b> Chebyshev filter (ripple only in passband), reverse Chebyshev filter (ripple only in <b>stopband)</b> and Butterworth filter (no ripple in either band).|$|E
5|$|The comb-line filter {{is similar}} to the {{interdigital}} filter in that it lends itself to mechanical assembly in a metal case without dielectric support. In the case of the comb-line, all the lines are short-circuited at the same end rather than alternate ends. The other ends are terminated in capacitors to ground, and the design is consequently classified as semi-lumped. The chief advantage of this design is that the upper <b>stopband</b> can be made very wide, that is, free of spurious passbands at all frequencies of interest.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{technical}} {{reason for this}} difficulty is that the frequency response of a simple filter approaches a fall of 6 dB/octave far {{from the point of}} resonance. This means that if telephone channels are squeezed in side-by-side into the frequency spectrum, there will be crosstalk from adjacent channels in any given channel. What is required is a much more sophisticated filter that has a flat frequency response in the required passband like a low-Q resonant circuit, but that rapidly falls in response (much faster than 6dB/octave) at the transition from passband to <b>stopband</b> like a high-Q resonant circuit. Obviously, these are contradictory requirements to be met with a single resonant circuit. The solution to these needs was founded in the theory of transmission lines and consequently the necessary filters did not become available until this theory was fully developed. At this early stage the idea of signal bandwidth, and hence the need for filters to match to it, was not fully understood; indeed, it was as late as 1920 before the concept of bandwidth was fully established. For early radio, the concepts of Q-factor, selectivity and tuning sufficed. This was all to change with the developing theory of transmission lines on which image filters are based, as explained in the next section.|$|E
40|$|At {{the design}} {{intensity}} of 1. 5 x 1013 ppp, the space charge tune {{shift in the}} AGS Booster at injection has been es-timated to be about 0. 35. The beam tunes are therefore spread over many lower order resonance lines and the as-sociated <b>stopbands</b> must be corrected {{in order to minimize}} the amplitude growth due to resonance excitation. This re-quires proper compensation of the resonance-driving har-monics which result from random magnetic field errors. The observation and correction of second and third order resonance <b>stopbands</b> in the AGS Booster is reviewed, and an analysis of magnetic field imperfections based on the required corrections is given. ...|$|R

40|$|An asymmetrically-loaded {{interdigital}} coupled line {{is proposed}} for design of wideband microstrip bandpass filters with good out-of-band performance. This interdigital coupled line with three fingers is formed by stretching {{one of two}} outer arms with one two-stage open-ended stub.

25|$|The {{frequency}} {{response of the}} Butterworth filter is maximally flat (i.e. has no ripples) in the passband and rolls off towards zero in the <b>stopband.</b>|$|E
25|$|Compared with a Chebyshev Type I/Type II filter or an {{elliptic}} filter, the Butterworth filter has {{a slower}} roll-off, and thus {{will require a}} higher order to implement a particular <b>stopband</b> specification, but Butterworth filters have a more linear phase response in the pass-band than Chebyshev Type I/Type II and elliptic filters can achieve.|$|E
25|$|When viewed on a {{logarithmic}} Bode plot, {{the response}} slopes off linearly towards negative infinity. A first-order filter's response rolls off at −6 dB per octave (−20 dB per decade) (all first-order lowpass filters {{have the same}} normalized frequency response).

These materials, however, come with an impaired NVH behaviour and thus require a smart design to meet the ever-increasing customer expectations and more stringent regulations. Vibro-acoustic metamaterials come to the fore as candidates for lightweight material systems with superior NVH insulation, be it at least in some targeted and tuneable frequency ranges, referred to as <b>stopbands.</b> These <b>stopbands</b> result from resonant cells arranged on a subwavelength scale and can be predicted through a unit cell analysis of the metamaterial structure, exploiting periodic structure theory.

500|$|A {{consequence}} of the image method of filter design is {{that the effect of}} the end terminations has to be calculated separately if its effects on response are to be taken into account.

[...] On the other hand, waves in the <b>stopband</b> are reflected from the end termination due to mismatch but are attenuated twice by the filter <b>stopband</b> rejection as they pass through it.

40|$|Abstract—A new K-band triple-stopband filter in {{substrate}} {{integrated waveguide}} (SIW) technology is introduced. The filter consists of six rectangular cavities resonating in their fundamental mode.

A corresponding coupling matrix is presented. The initial filter covers an overall bandwidth of 4. 50 GHz at center frequency of 19. 50 GHz. The three stop-bands are located at 17. 6, 19. 56, and 21. 34 GHz with bandwidths of 0. 92 GHz, 0. 82 GHz, and 0. 85 GHz, respectively. The two passbands located between the three <b>stopbands</b> have center fre-quencies of 18. 70 and 20. 56 GHz with corresponding bandwidths of 0. 97 GHz and 0. 88 GHz, respectively.
