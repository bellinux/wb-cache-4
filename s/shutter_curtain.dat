50|$|Figure 3: The first <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain</b> {{continues}} to travel across the frame aperture {{followed by the}} second curtain. It would be pointless to use an electronic flash with this shutter speed as the short duration flash would expose {{only a very small}} amount of the frame as the rest is covered by either the first or second <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain.</b>|$|E
50|$|Almost all {{contemporary}} SLRs use a {{focal-plane shutter}} located {{in front of}} the film plane, which prevents the light from reaching the film even if the lens is removed, except when the shutter is actually released during the exposure. There are various designs for focal plane shutters. Early focal-plane shutters designed from the 1930s onwards usually consisted of two curtains that travelled horizontally across the film gate: an opening <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain</b> followed by a closing <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain.</b> During fast shutter speeds, the focal-plane shutter would form a 'slit' whereby the second <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain</b> was closely following the first opening <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain</b> to produce a narrow, vertical opening, with the shutter slit moving horizontally. The slit would get narrower as shutter speeds were increased. Initially these shutters were made from a cloth material (which was in later years often rubberised), but some manufacturers used other materials instead. Nippon Kōgaku (now Nikon Corporation), for example, used titanium foil shutters for several of their flagship SLR cameras, including the Nikon F, F2, and F3.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} type of {{focal-plane shutter}} in 35 mm cameras, pioneered by Leitz {{for use in}} its Leica cameras, uses two <b>shutter</b> <b>curtains,</b> made of opaque rubberized fabric, that run horizontally across the film plane. For slower shutter speeds, the first curtain opens (usually) from right to left, and after the required time with the shutter open, the second curtain closes the aperture in the same direction. When the shutter is cocked again the <b>shutter</b> <b>curtains</b> are moved back to their starting positions, ready to be released.|$|R
50|$|The FTb has an all-mechanical {{horizontally}} traveling {{focal plane}} shutter with timed speeds from 1/1000 to 1 second and bulb. The FTb has rubberized silk <b>shutter</b> <b>curtains</b> rather than the more durable but more expensive titanium curtains found on the F-1.|$|R

50|$|For {{exposures}} {{slower than}} the X-sync speed, previous SLR flash systems triggered the flash {{at the start of}} the exposure, as soon as the first <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain</b> had finished its travel. However, for motion blurs and light trails in a longer exposure, this method gives the impression of backwards movement, since the motion trails out in front of the moving object after the flash. The T90, became the first mass-market camera to support second-curtain flash, where the flash fires at the end of the exposure, just before the second <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain</b> starts to close.|$|E
50|$|Figure 2: The first <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain</b> moves {{fully to}} the left {{allowing}} the exposure to be made. At this point the flash is made to fire if one is attached and ready to do so.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{graphical}} representation only; the actual mechanisms {{are much more}} complex. For example, the <b>shutter</b> <b>curtains</b> actually roll on and off spools at {{either side of the}} frame aperture so as to use as little space as possible.|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{the life}} of the V Series, Hasselblad {{incrementally}} updated the cameras. The 500 C gave way to the 500 C/M, the 503 CX and 503 CXi, the 501 C and 501 CM, and finally the 503 CW as the basic manual. The SWC was replaced by the SWC/M, the 903 SWC, and finally by the 905 SWC. The 500 EL's replacements included the 500 EL/M, 500 ELX, 553 ELX, and the 555 ELD. First introduced in the 500 ELX, TTL/OTF (through the lens/off the film) flash metering was also a feature of the 503 CX, which was replaced by the 503 CXi and finally the 503 CW.Alongside these 500-series cameras, a series of focal plane shutter cameras was introduced. They marked the return to Victor Hasselblad's original desire to have a small camera with fast shutter speeds (1/2000 s) and fast lenses. This 2000-series started with the 2000 FC, and progressed to the 2000 FC/M, 2000 FCW and 2003 FCW. Though much of the 20 years between the discontinuation of the 1000 F and the introduction of the 2000 FC was spent designing an improved focal plane shutter, the 2000-series again used corrugated metal foil as material for the <b>shutter</b> <b>curtains,</b> though now titanium replaced the original stainless steel. As before, the metal <b>shutter</b> <b>curtains</b> proved to be quite easily damaged by clumsy fingers, which is why all 2000-series cameras except the 2000FC have a safety feature that retracts the <b>shutter</b> <b>curtains</b> as soon as the magazine is taken off. The 2000-series cameras were replaced by the 200-series cameras (with rubberized cloth <b>shutter</b> <b>curtains),</b> which included the 201 F, 202 FA, 203 FE, and 205 TCC/205 FCC. While the 201 F was a manual control camera, the other three 200-series models added a level of metering and exposure automation to the V series.|$|R
50|$|Instead {{of using}} {{relatively}} slow-moving mechanical <b>shutter</b> <b>curtains,</b> electro-optic {{devices such as}} Pockels cells can be employed as shutters. While not commonly used, they completely avoid {{the problems associated with}} travelling-curtain shutters such as flash synchronisation limitations and image distortions when the object is moving. Such shutters are significantly more costly than mechanical shutters.|$|R
50|$|This {{is because}} {{even at the}} most {{powerful}} settings, flash durations seldom exceed a few milliseconds (thousandths of a second). With focal-plane shutters, a flash begins shortly after the <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain</b> has fully opened and must extinguish before the curtain begins to close. Selecting any shutter speed faster than the camera’s rated Xsync speed, which is often between 1/60&thinsp;th and 1/200&thinsp;th of a second (from as long as 16.7 milliseconds to as little as 5.0 milliseconds) causes the <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain</b> to begin wiping closed across the film or sensor before the flash has extinguished. When this happens, an underexposed, gradated band appears along an edge of the image—often trailing off darker towards the left or bottom.|$|E
50|$|Figure 2: The first <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain</b> {{begins to}} move to the left {{allowing}} the exposure to be made. Because the exposure requires a very fast shutter speed, the second curtain {{begins to move}} across at a set distance from the first one.|$|E
50|$|Figure 3: After the {{required}} amount of exposure the second <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain</b> {{moves to the}} left to cover the frame aperture. When the shutter is recocked the shutter curtains are wound back to the right hand side {{ready for the next}} exposure.|$|E
50|$|Faster shutter speeds are {{achieved}} by the second curtain closing before the first one has fully opened; {{this results in a}} vertical slit that travels horizontally across the film. Faster shutter speeds simply require a narrower slit, as the speed of travel of the <b>shutter</b> <b>curtains</b> is not normally varied. Using this technique, modern SLR cameras are capable of shutter speeds of up to 1/2000, 1/4000 or even 1/8000 of a second.|$|R

50|$|The Pentax ME was an {{aperture}} priority automatic camera, {{with an electronic}} focal plane shutter from 8 s to 1/1000 s, synchronized at 1/100 s. The <b>shutter</b> <b>curtains</b> were metal and had a vertical movement. There was no shutter dial, and the camera {{could not be used}} in manual mode, except for B and 1/100 exposures. The exposure meter was of the standard TTL open aperture center weighted type. It was activated by a slight pressure on the release button.|$|R

50|$|The VT used a cloth <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain,</b> and shutter speeds {{were from}} 1s to 1/1000, plus T and B. Available Canon lenses ranged from 25mm to 800mm, and offered lenses {{as fast as}} f/1.2. Flash sync is {{available}} for FP, M, and X.|$|E
5000|$|The camera {{does not}} have a flash sync on its hot shoe. Instead a pc sync socket is provided.

50|$|For a {{horizontal}} Leica-type FP shutter, {{the image is}} stretched if the object moves {{in the same direction}} as the <b>shutter</b> <b>curtains,</b> and compressed if travelling in the opposite direction of them. For a downward firing vertical Square-type FP shutter, the top of the image leans forward. In fact, the use of leaning to give the impression of speed in illustration is a caricature of the distortion caused by the slow wiping vertical FP shutters of large format cameras from the first half of the 20th century.|$|R

5000|$|When photographing rapidly moving objects, {{the use of}} a {{focal-plane shutter}} can produce some {{unexpected}} effects, since the film closest to the start position of the curtains is exposed earlier than the film closest to the end position. Typically this can result in a moving object leaving a slanting image. The direction of the slant depends on the direction the <b>shutter</b> <b>curtains</b> run in (noting also that as in all cameras the image is inverted and reversed by the lens, i.e. [...] "top-left" [...] is at the bottom right of the sensor as seen by a photographer behind the camera).|$|R
50|$|The Nikon S4 was a {{rangefinder}} camera {{produced by}} Nikon {{that was very}} similar to the Nikon S3 but had a slightly lower price. This was because it used a cloth <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain</b> (rather than titanium foil curtains) and it lacked the self-timer and motor drive lug of the S3. The viewfinder frame-line for 35mm lenses was also omitted. In all other respects, the cameras were identical.|$|E
50|$|Electronic flash {{units have}} {{compatibility}} issues with focal-plane shutters. Focal-plane shutters expose using two curtains that cross the sensor. The first one opens {{and the second}} curtain follows it after a delay equal to the nominal shutter speed. A typical modern focal-plane shutter takes about 1/200 s to cross the sensor, so at exposure times shorter than this {{only part of the}} sensor is uncovered at any one time. Electronic flash can have durations as short as 50 µs, so at such short exposure times only part of the sensor is exposed. This limits the shutter speed to about 1/200 s when using flash. In the past, slow-burning single-use flash bulbs allowed the use of focal-plane shutters at maximum speed because they produced continuous light for the time taken for the exposing slit to cross the film gate. If these are found they cannot be used on modern cameras because the bulb must be fired *before* the first <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain</b> begins to move (M-sync); the X-sync used for electronic flash normally fires only when the first <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain</b> reaches the end of its travel.|$|E
5000|$|In 1986, {{a special}} ultra-durable {{version of the}} OM-4 with champagne-colored {{titanium}} top and bottom plates, upgraded electronic circuitry and improved weatherproofing, called the OM-4Ti (OM-4T in the USA), was released, with a US list price of $770. The OM-4Ti also introduced a new electronic flash-control system. Normally focal-plane shutters are limited in their maximum flash synchronization speed, {{because of the way}} they provide fast shutter speeds - timing the second <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain</b> to close more quickly after the first <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain</b> opens. This causes a narrowing of the slit [...] "wiping" [...] the exposure on the film. In effect, a horizontal focal-plane shutter made of cloth is only fully open and usable for flash exposure up to 1/60s. Any faster and a typical one-millisecond flash burst would only partially expose the film - the part open to the slit. The OM-4Ti overcame this problem by having the new Olympus F280 Full Synchro flash pulse its light continuously over 40 milliseconds, long enough to illuminate the slit as it crossed the entire focal plane, even at shutter speeds as fast as 1/2000s. There is, however, a concomitant loss of flash range. [...] A black-finished version of the OM-4T came out in 1990, listing for $1250 (the natural finished body remained available for $1200).|$|E

50|$|The Nikon F2 is a {{professional}} level, interchangeable lens, 35 mm film, single-lens reflex (SLR) camera. It was manufactured by the Japanese optics company Nippon Kogaku K. K. (Nikon Corporation since 1988) in Japan from September 1971 to 1980. It used a horizontal-travel focal plane shutter with titanium <b>shutter</b> <b>curtains</b> and a speed range of 1 to 1/2000 second (up to 10 seconds using the self-timer) plus Bulb and Time, and flash X-sync of 1/80th second. It had dimensions (with DE-1 head, see below) of 98 mm height, 152.5 mm width, 65 mm depth and 730 g weight. It was available in two colors: black with chrome trim and all black.|$|R
50|$|It is true the finder {{does not}} go black during exposure, but at small lens apertures, the eye has no time {{to adjust to the}} dark finder. The {{operating}} noise from the Pellix is surprisingly {{similar to that of the}} Canon FX using a moving reflex mirror. Canon made two fast lenses, the FL 50mm 1:1.4 and the FL 58mm 1:1.2, in order to compensate for the light loss, but fast lenses might increase the risk of the sun burning holes in the <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain</b> not being protected by a solid mirror; a fact anticipated and solved by providing the Pellix with a metal <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain.</b> Another obstacle is the risk of light finding its way into the camera by way of the finder window during exposure, since there is no mirror to block the path in its up-position. This was also anticipated, and a finder blind is provided which is operated by turning the ring under the rewind knob, especially useful when leaving the camera on a stand. The Meter circuit is susceptible to breakage due to the CdS meter arm being moved into position behind the pellicle mirror during exposure reading. A special lens was made available for the Canon Pellix, the FLP 38mm 1:2.8, utilising the fact the camera has a stationary mirror that will not hit the lens' rear element. The FLP code indicates that this lens is exclusively to be used on Pellix camera.|$|E
50|$|The Pentax LX {{model was}} a tough, professional-grade {{competitor}} to the Nikon F3, the Canon F-1, Olympus OM cameras, and Contax RTS. It is rugged, weatherised and sealed against dust, yet compact and light. It has {{interchangeable focusing screen}} and viewfinder; the S69 screen is particularly bright. The LX uses an advanced metering system that also reads the light falling on the film and the first <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain</b> during exposure, the TTL OTF (off the film) feature, a Minolta patent, but utilised by Olympus in the OM-2 in 1975. The selected aperture value and shutter speed are shown in the viewfinder. The camera remained in production for more than 20 years.|$|E
5000|$|At first, {{electromagnets}} {{controlled by}} analogue resistor/capacitor timers {{were used to}} govern {{the release of the}} second <b>shutter</b> <b>curtain</b> (though still operated by spring power). In 1979, the Yashica Contax 139 Quartz (Japan) introduced more precise digital piezoelectric quartz (shortly followed by ceramic) oscillator circuits (ultimately under digital microprocessor control) to time and sequence its entire exposure cycle - including its vertical FP shutter. Electric [...] "coreless" [...] micromotors, with near instantaneous on/off capability and very high power for their size, would drive both curtains (and other camera systems), replacing springs altogether, in the late 1980s. Minimizing mechanical moving parts also helped to prevent inertial shock vibration problems.|$|E
