40|$|Efforts to {{strengthen}} health information systems in low- and middle-income countries should include forging links with systems in other {{social and economic}} sectors. Governments are seeking comprehensive socioeconomic data {{on the basis of}} which to implement strategies for poverty reduction and to monitor achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The health sector is looking to take action on the social factors that determine health outcomes. But there are duplications and inconsistencies between sectors in the collection, reporting, storage and analysis of socioeconomic data. National offices of statistics give higher priority to collection and analysis of economic than to social statistics. The Report of the Commission for Africa has estimated that an additional US$ 60 million a year is needed to improve systems to collect and analyse statistics in Africa. Some donors recognize that such systems have been weakened by numerous international demands for indicators, and have pledged support for national initiatives {{to strengthen}} statistical systems, as well as <b>sectoral</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> such as those in health and education. Many governments are working to coordinate information systems to monitor and evaluate poverty reduction strategies. There is therefore an opportunity for the health sector to collaborate with other sectors to lever international resources to rationalize definition and measurement of indicators common to several sectors; streamline the content, frequency and timing of household surveys; and harmonize national and subnational databases that store socioeconomic data. Without long-term commitment to improve training and build career structures for statisticians and information technicians working in the health and other sectors, improvements in information and statistical systems cannot be sustained...|$|E

40|$|The Swiss {{agricultural}} <b>sectoral</b> <b>information</b> and forecasting <b>system</b> (SILAS) {{is based}} on the PMP standard approach. The marginal cost functions are estimated by exogenous elasticities. Due to the lack of empirical data the elasticities were set for all activities to unity. Based on total milk production costs of FADN farms, regional supply functions were estimated. The results are used to adjust the marginal cost functions of organic and non-organic dairy cow activities in the model SILAS to the empirically estimated functions. The results show that the marginal cost functions in the sectoral model are in general a bit steeper than in the FADN estimations, when elasticities by the value one are applied. Major differences between organic and non-organic milk production could not be observed. Adjusting the slope of the marginal cost functions to the empirically estimated ones leads to slightly different forecast results. Mainly the number of organic cows is higher in the FADN adjusted scenario than in the reference scenario without any adjustments.

40|$|Inflation is a {{far from}} {{homogeneous}} phenomenon, a fact often neglected in modeling consumer price inflation. Using a novel methodology grounded in theory, the ten sub-components of {{the consumer price index}} (excluding mortgage interest rates), are modeled separately and forecast, four-quartersahead. Equilibrium correction models in a rich multivariate form employ general and <b>sectoral</b> <b>information,</b> and take account of structural breaks and institutional changes. Our methods allow for longer lags than conventionally considered in VARs, but in a parsimonious manner. Sign priors are imposed on long-run effects and automatic model selection is used to select parsimonious models from more general ones. The models throw light on sectoral sources of inflation, useful to monetary policy. Data for 1979 to 2003 are used for model selection, and pseudo out of sample forecasting performance to the end of 2007 is examined. Aggregating the weighted sub-component forecasts indicates gains are made over forecasting the overall index using these methods, and also substantial gains over forecasting using benchmark naïve models. To extend this work, including <b>sectoral</b> <b>information</b> such as an explicit treatment of tax policy, regulatory information and announced administered price rises, should further enhance these forecasting methods. ...|$|R

Agriculture comprised 79 % of rural employment in 2004 but only 62 %, 8  years later.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we generalise {{the notion of}} (algebraic) <b>information</b> <b>system</b> to {{continuous}} <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> Just as algebraic <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> are concrete representations of Scott domains, continuous <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> are concrete representations of continuous Scott domains. The class of continuous <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> can be generated from the subclass of qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> {{in the sense that}} the category of continuous <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> is equivalent to the Karoubi envelope of the category of qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> Because qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> correspond to the qualitative domains of Girard (Theoret.
