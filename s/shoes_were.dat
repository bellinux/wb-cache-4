5|$|According to Shinkai, <b>shoes</b> <b>were</b> {{a metaphor}} for life as Yukari learned to walk again, while Takao's shoe-making typified their relationship. Similarly, Yukari's choice of food and beverages—initially beer and chocolate, due to a stress-induced taste disorder—was {{a metaphor for}} her {{emotional}} health.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} scenes then follow whose exact {{sequence}} is unclear. Odd goes {{to visit his}} mother at the retirement home, which only makes him more unhappy: his mother is senile and spends her days staring emptily out the window, and the visit reminds him of his own impending old age. While Odd is at a restaurant, police come in and arrest the cook. At the shop where he normally buys his pipe tobacco, he learns that the owner has died. He decides to sell his boat, leading to misadventures when the buyer, who works at an airport, asks Odd to meet him there inside the secure zone. Odd goes to the local swimming pool, but his <b>shoes</b> <b>were</b> removed when the facility closed; as he is leaving, he finds a pair of red high-heeled boots and walks away in them.|$|E
5|$|Kim's {{associates}} {{characterize the}} director as an eccentric individual. Tokyo International Film Festival programming director Kenji Ishizaka recalls that Kim's way {{of writing a}} screenplay was {{to walk away from}} home for three months. He would shut himself up in a cheap hotel, listen to neighborhood gossip, and write all night in the dark. South Korean film critic Lee Young-il remembers that Kim's <b>shoes</b> <b>were</b> never shined, and that one of his few material pleasures was high-quality coffee. Kim Ki-young's unconventional and nonconformist nature also prevented him from participating in South Korea's mainstream film industry. The only official title he held within the film community was member of The National Academy of Arts, which he joined in 1997, and he did not cultivate friendships with journalists who could further his career.|$|E

5|$|Later in a motel, they {{interrogate}} Szalay, whose friend Gary {{had been}} abducted just before Mulder; Szalay was investigating the UFO reports in Montana {{in an attempt}} to find him. Doggett reports that fresh footprints from Nike <b>shoes</b> <b>were</b> noted in the area Hoese was found, making Doggett skeptical about Szalay's claims to alien sightings. Meanwhile, Jeremiah Smith has assumed the form of a doctor and arranges for Hoese to be transferred. Having learned of Hoese's disappearance, Doggett calls Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish). Reyes assists in the investigation, believing that Mulder may have joined a UFO cult. In a derelict compound, Smith cures Hoese of her injuries, as observed by a man called Absalom.|$|E
5|$|At {{any given}} time, Treblinka I had a {{workforce}} of 1,000–2,000 prisoners, {{most of whom}} worked 12- to 14-hour shifts in the large quarry and later also harvested wood from the nearby forest as fuel for the open-air crematoria in Treblinka II. There were German, Czech and French Jews among them, as well as Poles captured in łapankas, farmers unable to deliver food requisitions, hostages trapped by chance, and people who attempted to harbour Jews outside the Jewish ghettos or who performed restricted actions without permits. Beginning in July 1942, Jews and non-Jews were separated. Women mainly worked in the sorting barracks, where they repaired and cleaned military clothing delivered by freight trains, {{while most of the}} men worked at the gravel mine. There were no work uniforms, and inmates who lost their own <b>shoes</b> <b>were</b> forced to go barefoot or scavenge them from dead prisoners. Water was rationed, and punishments were regularly delivered at roll-calls. From December 1943 the inmates were no longer carrying any specific sentences. The camp operated officially until 23 July 1944, when the imminent arrival of Soviet forces led to its abandonment.|$|E
5|$|The soft organic {{material}} aboard and dispersed onto the seabed around the hull {{would have been}} the first to disappear, rapidly devoured by fish and crustaceans. Wood-boring molluscs such as Teredo colonized the ship's decks and interior in huge numbers, eating away the wooden decking and other wooden objects such as furniture, paneling, doors and staircase banisters. When their food ran out they died, leaving behind calcareous tubes. The question of the victims' bodies is one that has often troubled explorers of the wreck site. When the debris field was surveyed in Robert Ballard's 1986 expedition, pairs of <b>shoes</b> <b>were</b> observed lying next to each other on the sea bed. The flesh, bones, and clothes had long since been consumed but the tannin in the shoes' leather had apparently resisted the bacteria, leaving the shoes as the only markers of where a body had once lain. Ballard has suggested that skeletons may remain deep within Titanics hull, such as in the engine rooms or third-class cabins. This has been disputed by scientists, who have estimated that the bodies would have completely disappeared by the early 1940s at the latest.|$|E
50|$|Organ <b>shoes</b> <b>are</b> <b>shoes</b> worn by organists, {{designed}} to facilitate playing of the organ pedal keyboard. Also, since organ <b>shoes</b> <b>are</b> worn {{only at the}} organ, the use of special footwear avoids picking up grit or grime that could scar or stain the pedal keys. <b>Shoes</b> <b>are</b> not always used, some famous organists like Rhoda Scott play with bare feet.|$|R

5|$|Thomas Dales, an {{assistant}} constable, arrived from Birmingham, {{where he was}} one of those responsible for policing the town. On ascertaining the situation he interrogated Thornton, and soon arrested him. However, Dales did not keep any notes and later proved unable to remember much of what the prisoner told him. Thornton was then examined by the local magistrate, William Bedford, who ordered Thornton searched. The search revealed that Thornton was wearing underclothing with bloodstains, and Thornton admitted having sexual intercourse with Ashford the previous night. The prisoner's <b>shoes</b> <b>were</b> removed, and comparisons with the footprints in the field were made by the factory workers, who later testified at trial that they matched. A post-mortem examination revealed that Ashford died from drowning, and that the only marks on her body were two lacerations in the genital area. The examination concluded that until the sexual act which caused the bleeding, Ashford was a virgin. She was menstruating at the time of her death.|$|E
5|$|Towns such as Castle Cary and Frome grew {{around the}} medieval weaving industry. Street {{developed}} as a centre {{for the production of}} woollen slippers and, later, boots and shoes, with C. & J. Clark establishing its headquarters in the town. C Clark's shoes are no longer manufactured there as the work was transferred to lower-wage areas, such as China and Asia. Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village, the first purpose-built factory outlet in the UK. C Clark also had shoe factories, at one time at Bridgwater, Minehead, Westfield and Weston super Mare to provide employment outside the main summer tourist season, but those satellite sites were closed in the late 1980s, before the main site at Street. Dr. Martens <b>shoes</b> <b>were</b> also made in Somerset, by the Northampton-based R. Griggs Group, using redundant skilled shoemakers from C Clark; that work has also been transferred to Asia.|$|E
5|$|On December 4, 1946, Harrison set {{out from}} Shanghai with {{approximately}} 50 tonnes of supplies. On this train journey, {{he was to be}} accompanied by a Russian UNRRA worker and Chinese welfare representatives. Due to repeated Kuomintang inspections, the train journey constantly suffered from delays. The first such delay occurred at Nanjing and lasted four days; the second such delay, at Xuzhou, was of equal duration. At one station, the medical supplies were unhooked from the train's engine car and left on a bleak plain. The two UNRRA workers did not have clean water to drink and were forced to boil ditch water which was polluted with human waste. To add to the dire situation, Harrison's blanket and <b>shoes</b> <b>were</b> stolen, and due to the cold, he began to suffer from frostbite. Two weeks after Harrison left Shanghai, his train was permitted to move again, but there were problems still ahead. At each one of the 20 stations en route to Kaifeng, the train was delayed for up to three hours. Upon arrival at Kaifeng, the journey had to be completed by truck and ox cart. After completing one delivery, he returned to Kaifeng to pick up a second load, but could not continue past the Zhangqiu branch of the receiving hospital. Harrison died of exposure on January 10, 1947, near Kaifeng in China, aged 66.|$|E

25|$|<b>Shoes</b> <b>were</b> {{narrow and}} often emphasized. They had a pointed toe and a medium height heel. Buttons, patent leather, and laced {{models of the}} shoe were also {{manufactured}} and readily available. Similarly, there were shoes for every occasion; oxfords for a tailored costume, slippers with straps for festive occasions or pumps with pearl buckles, and finally, boots which were often edged in fur {{to stave off the}} winter chill when riding in a carriage in the winter. At the beginning of 1900s shoes still maintained the same design of the Victorian era. <b>Shoes</b> <b>were</b> commonly made with seal skin or Moroccan leather. Having boots made of seal skin was most common for people in a higher social class. Seal skin boots were known to be extremely durable and could be worn during every season. Boots made from Moroccan leather were more uncomfortable and stiff. World War I caused this opulent era to tone down due to the increased sanctions on the trade of leather and other fabrics, and <b>shoes</b> <b>were</b> starting to incorporate a fabric topping.|$|E
25|$|Many medieval <b>shoes</b> <b>were</b> {{made using}} the turnshoe method of construction, {{in which the}} upper was turned flesh side out, and was lasted onto the sole and joined to the edge by a seam. The shoe was then turned inside-out so that the grain was outside. Some <b>shoes</b> <b>were</b> {{developed}} with toggled flaps or drawstrings to tighten the leather around the foot for a better fit. Surviving medieval turnshoes often fit the foot closely, with {{the right and left}} shoe being mirror images. Around 1500, the turnshoe method was largely replaced by the welted rand method (where the uppers are sewn to a much stiffer sole and the shoe cannot be turned inside-out). The turnshoe method is still used for some dance and specialty shoes.|$|E
