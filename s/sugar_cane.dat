5|$|In {{another study}} {{commissioned}} by the Dutch government in 2006 to evaluate the sustainability of Brazilian bioethanol concluded that there is sufficient water to supply all foreseeable long-term water requirements for sugarcane and ethanol production. This evaluation also found that consumption of agrochemicals for <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> production is lower than in citric, corn, coffee and soybean cropping. The study found that development of resistant <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> varieties is a crucial aspect of disease and pest control {{and is one of}} the primary objectives of Brazil’s cane genetic improvement programs. Disease control is one of the main reasons for the replacement of a commercial variety of <b>sugar</b> <b>cane.</b>|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} innovations of UPLB was the production of CAC 87 <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> in 1919. This high-yielding variety is resistant to fiji and mosaic viruses, and produces more sucrose than other varieties. Its derivatives significantly increased <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> production in the Philippines. Between 1921 and 1939, cattle, poultry, and swine breeding programs produced new breeds, namely the Philamin (a hybrid of the Hereford, Nellore and native cattle), Berkjala (a variety of the Berkshire and local Jala-Jala pig, resistant to hog cholera) and the Los Baños Cantonese chicken, which produces more eggs.|$|E

5|$|In August 1492, Christopher Columbus {{stopped at}} La Gomera in the Canary Islands, for wine and water, {{intending}} to stay only four days. He became romantically {{involved with the}} governor of the island, Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ossorio, and stayed a month. When he finally sailed, she gave him cuttings of sugarcane, which became the first to reach the New World. The first <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> harvest was conducted in Hispaniola in 1501, and many sugar mills had been constructed in Cuba and Jamaica by the 1520s. The Portuguese took <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> to Brazil. By 1540, there were 800 cane sugar mills in Santa Catarina Island and another 2,000 on the north coast of Brazil, Demarara, and Surinam.|$|E
5|$|Sugar {{also led}} to some {{industrialization}} of areas where <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> was grown. For example, Lieutenant J. Paterson, of the Bengal establishment, persuaded the British Government that <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> could be cultivated in British India with many advantages and at less expense than in the West Indies; as a result, sugar factories were established in Bihar in eastern India. During the Napoleonic Wars, sugar beet production increased in continental Europe {{because of the difficulty}} of importing sugar when shipping was subject to blockade. By 1880, the sugar beet was the main source of sugar in Europe. It was cultivated in Lincolnshire and other parts of England, although the United Kingdom continued to import the main part of its sugar from its colonies.|$|E

5|$|Food {{production}} at Gedi likely involved a mixed economy based on livestock, {{as well as}} agricultural and horticultural production. Some foods were introduced through trade.

5|$|Making {{landfall}} {{near the}} border between Mexico and British Honduras, the latter colony's Corozal and Orange Walk districts, containing a population of 15,500at the time, experienced severe devastation from Janet. Strong hurricane winds knocked down and damaged numerous trees across British Honduras, particularly in the Freshwater Creek Forest Preserve. There, an estimated 30%of all trees had been damaged, especially mahogany and sapodilla trees. Hurricane Janet also caused extensive damage to crops, with an estimated $2.631million in damages. Fruit trees, maize, and <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> crops suffered the most damage. <b>Sugar</b> <b>cane</b> was {{expected to have a}} 20%decrease in yield due to the damage sustained after the storm. Pineapple crops and livestock experienced less significant losses. To a lesser extent, the hurricane also affected the Belize District and several of British Honduras' offshore cayes. Similar to Corozal and Orange Walk Districts, corn, trees, and coconut experienced the most severe damage of any crop.|$|E
