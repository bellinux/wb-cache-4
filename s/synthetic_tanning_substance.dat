40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is the at least {{partially}} substitution of chrom tanning agents by production of leather. This will be achieved by extracting of natural tanning agents from the roots of local species of the Polygonaceae plant familiy. The research project has been conducted in cooperation with NIG GmbH Magdeburg (processing of raw material) and FILK gGmbH (testing the tanning agents on leather). The FH Anhalt cultivates the species Rheum, Reynoutria and Rumex and examines and describes the <b>tanning</b> <b>substances</b> in these plants using chemical-analytical methods. Results: a growth period {{of at least two}} years is necessary for plants to develop enough biomass and tanning agents. In Reynoutria the <b>tanning</b> <b>substances</b> are located in leaves which are easier to harvest. The leaves can be harvested several times in the year over a period of up to ten years. The <b>tanning</b> <b>substances</b> were studied using HPLC and DC. The concentration of the <b>tanning</b> <b>substances</b> in raw material determined by calibration with <b>tanning</b> <b>substances</b> from Quebracho was insufficient. The combination of HPLC with other separation techniques such as HPTLC will be more efficient in developing analytical method for the on-line observation of the raw material. Further investigations involving larger quantities of extracts are necessary in order to consolidate the results obtained so far. These investigations should be extended to include the species Reynoutria and Polygonum. Further investigations should concentrate on the production and utilisation of the different pigments found in the roots of Rheum and Rumex for use in heavy metal-free dyeing of leather and textiles.

As peles foram distribuídas em delineamento inteiramente casualizado, em esquema fatorial 4 x 2, sendo quatro técnicas de recutimento (T 1 = 4 % de sais de cromo; T 2 = 4 % taninos vegetais; T 3 = 4 % taninos sintéticos e T 4 = 2 % taninos sintéticos e 2 % vegetais) e dois sentidos do couro (S 1 =Longitudinal; S 2 =Transversal), com 6 repetições. Para os testes de determinação da resistência à tração, alongamento e rasgamento progressivo foi utilizado o dinamômetro EMIC, com velocidade de afastamento entre as cargas de 100 ± 20 mm/mm, em ambiente climatizado (± 23 º C e UR do ar de 50 %), por 24 horas (ABNT-NBR 10455, 1988). A técnica de recurtimento influenciou na espessura do couro, sendo que com sais de cromo (T 1 = 0, 61 a 0, 68 mm) a espessura foi {{inferior}} aos demais tratamentos (1, 30 a 1, 53 mm). O sentido do couro não teve influencia sobre a espessura. Os couros recurtidos com sais de cromo apresentaram significativamente valores superiores para tração (30, 31 N/mm 2), alongamento (52, 42 %) e rasgamento progressivo (91, 23 N/mm) comparados aos curtidos com os taninos vegetais, sintéticos ou combinados. O sentido longitudinal do couro apresentou superior tração (23, 00 N/mm 2) comparado ao transversal (12, 03 N/mm 2), porém, não diferiu no teste de alongamento e rasgamento progressivo entre o longitudinal e transversal. Segundo padrões da literatura, o couro curtido ao cromo deve apresentar uma resistência à tração de mínimo de 9, 80 N/mm 2, 60 % para elongação e 14, 70 N/mm para rasgo.

In order to determine the resistance to traction, elongation and gradual tearing were used dynamometer EMIC, with offset speed between 100 loads ± 20 mm/mm, in climatized environment (± 23 º C and UR of the 50 % air), for 24 hours (ABNT-NBR 10455, 1988). The retanning technique influenced the thickness of the leather which became inferior (1. 30 to 1. 53 mm) to other treatments due to the chromium salts (T 1 = 0. 61 to 0. 68 mm). The course of the leather did not influence the thickness. The leather retanned with chromium salts did not present significant values for traction (30. 31 N/mm 2), elongation (52. 42 %) and gradual tearing (91. 23 N/mm) compared with the tanned ones with vegetal, <b>synthetic</b> <b>tanning</b> barks or combined values.

[...] Boston UniversityTanning {{is defined}} as a process of skin {{treatment}} whereby the hot water shrinkage point of the skin is raised, the fibres of the skin substance are prevented from mutually adhering on drying, and the skin substance is protected from putrefaction under ordinary conditions in air. There are various kinds of tanning processes such as vegetable tanning, chrome tanning, formaldehyde tanning, oil <b>tanning</b> and <b>synthetic</b> <b>tanning.</b> In vegetable tanning the materials used for the actual preservation process are obtained from the bark or wood or other parts of various trees or plants. Vegetable tannins may be conveniently divided into three groups. The first of these is the class of depsides or gallotannins which are hydrolysable and yield gallic acid. The second group consists of hydrolysable tannins which yield ellagic acid. The third group consists of non-hydrolysable tannins called phlobatannins. The latter yield red-colored insoluble products called "phlobaphenes" on boiling with acid. Catechin tannin is a phlobatannin and the structure of catechin is known, but not the structure of its tannin. The structure of no phlobatannin is known at present. Many have speculated as to their general structure on very slim evidence and some tannins have been synthesized which appear qualitatively similar to phlobatannins, but no real proof of structure has been forthcoming.

Shrinkage temperature of the leather changed little after the non combined DHNs had been removed from the leather, indicating that the high stability of the combination tanned leather comes from the covalent bonding formed between DHNs and collagen through oxazolidine.

The loss of individual oligomers was correlated with the length of the NSA-CH 2 chain. Approximately 25 % of the total CNSF was degraded (i. e. mineralised) by the microbes contained in the four activated sludges and by the two bacterial isolates but with different lag phases and at different overall rates. The decline in CNSF concentration was due almost entirely to the biodegradation of the monomers (34. 3 % of CNSF) and, in particular, 2 -NSA (27 % of CNSF). There was no change in the n 2 -n 11 components. The growth of C. polymorpha, on the other hand, arose from extracellular depolymerisation of CNSF oligomers and the biodegradation of the lower molecular mass products. Between 38 % and 42 % of total CNSF was degraded by C. polymorpha at 25 °C. The order of oligomer degradation was inversely related to degree of polymerisation. Eighty percent and 90 % of the n 4 and n 5 and 100 % oligomers n 6 -n 11 were degraded after 120 h. At a higher temperature (37 °C) oligomers n 4 -n 11 were degraded completely after 120 h. A combination of biodegradation (75 %) and sorption to fungal biomass (25 %) accounted for the measured loss of all oligomers from the solution phase. The CNSF degradation rates and the volume of fungal biomass produced (and therefore the extent of biosorption) were dependent on the presence of a second carbon source (both optimum at glucose 5 g/l). This is the first report that identifies and distinguishes between depolymerisation, sorption and biodegradation processes in the removal of CNSF and its component oligomers. The use of combinations of the depolymerising fungus C. polymorpha, and the monomer-degrading bacteria, Arthrobacter sp. 2 AC and Comamonas sp. 4 BC, have potential for wastewater treatment. © Springer 2005...|$|R

It may constitute a potential pollution source of ground waters and hence it has to be eliminated. In the work the elimination of phenol from synthesized aqueous solutions was carried out by adsorption onto non activated carbon obtained from calcinations up to 600 °C in exclusion air of a local cereal by-product. A kinetic study was also included where equilibrium was reached at the end of 120 minutes. A parametric study was also performed by investigating the effect of key parameters such as the pH and initial concentration. The adsorption isotherm was also examined where the results showed that at low concentrations, it is of type IV according to the BET classification whereas at high values of concentration the process seemed to be of a multi-layer type. The results showed that a high retention of the phenol exceeding 70 % was achieved for an initial concentration of 20 mg/l, at 20 °C, a mean size diameter of 0. 1 mm, a mixing velocity of 600 rpm, an adsorbent concentration of 10 g /l, a pH= 3 and contact time of two hour...|$|R
