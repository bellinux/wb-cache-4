40|$|Pigs {{are often}} housed in barren {{intensive}} housing systems {{but according to}} council directive 2008 / 120 /EC, they must have access to enrichment materials. In order to be successful, enrichment should be destructible, edible, nutritional and dung-free. <b>Straw</b> {{seems to be an}} interesting enrichment material but is not a practical option for fully-slatted systems. Producers must therefore provide <b>straw</b> applications to reduce <b>straw</b> waste through the slatted floor. Both the type of <b>straw</b> used and the design of the application might influence the interest for and the effectiveness of the materials. It is therefore designated to verify differences in ways to present enrichment materials, in order to detect applications which are less interesting for pigs. To this end, four <b>straw</b> applications were tested simultaneously (1 enrichment application per pen) during 4 cohorts, presenting them each time during two weeks to 6 pigs (total n = 96) in pens with slatted floors. The four applications tested were a <b>straw</b> rack (long-stemmed <b>straw),</b> a <b>straw</b> feeder (long-stemmed <b>straw),</b> a MIK Toy (in rolls pressed chopped <b>straw)</b> and the Ikadan <b>Straw</b> Dispenser with chopped <b>straw.</b> All pigs had ad libitum access to <b>straw</b> from one of the applications. Behaviour was recorded using video cameras. Data were analysed per individual pig for week 1 and week 2 separately using the logistic mixed model. The daily used <b>straw</b> quantity per pen was registered during the entire test period. The quantity of <b>straw</b> use was the highest in presence of the <b>straw</b> rack (P < 0. 0001), with an average <b>straw</b> use of approximately 2 kg per pen (6 pigs) per week. <b>Straw</b> use did not differ between week 1 and week 2 for any of the applications, but manipulative behaviour towards the application decreased for all applications during week 2 compared to week 1. This suggests a decrease in the required time to intake <b>straw</b> from the applications. In presence of the <b>straw</b> feeder, most of the time only one pig was occupied with the application, while in presence of the <b>straw</b> rack, the MIK Toy and the Funbar, more pigs interacted simultaneously with the device (P < 0. 0001). Pigs spent more consecutive scans interacting with the <b>straw</b> rack and the <b>straw</b> feeder (P = 0. 0003), which could be explained by the use of long <b>straw</b> with these applications. The results show that the duration of interactions with the applications might depend on the type of <b>straw</b> that is used.
