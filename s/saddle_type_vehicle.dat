40|$|We {{propose the}} pf+pd mixing model for CeSb {{to explain the}} {{stability}} of the ferromagnetic double layer structure in the magnetic ordering. The pd mixing causes the <b>saddle</b> <b>type</b> singular points, neighboring the Δ axis, for the bands which gain energy through the pf hybridization with the occupied f state. The peak of the density of states due to this combined effect of the pf mixing and the pd mixing enhances {{the stability of the}} double layer structure. The same combined effect also causes the <b>saddle</b> <b>type</b> singular points in the joint density of states of the optical transition. The peak structure of the magneto-optical spectra which has been observed in experiments is explained by the present model. Comment: 9 pages, 14 figure...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the possible influences of <b>saddle</b> <b>type</b> on {{the incidence of}} "lower back pain" in {{a cross section of}} equestrian riders. METHODS: 108 equestrian riders completed a questionnaire concerning their riding habits and whether they suffered from lower back pain. In particular they were asked whether they used a traditional style/general purpose saddle (GP) or a deep seated/Western style saddle (W). RESULTS: 48 % of the riders reported suffering from lower back pain, the incidence being higher in the GP saddle users (66 %) than in W saddle users (23 %) (P < 0. 001). Female riders had a higher incidence of lower back pain than males, 58 % v 27 % (P < 0. 005). When the genders were analysed separately for the effect of <b>saddle</b> <b>type,</b> males using the GP and W saddles had a 33 % and 6 % incidence of lower back pain respectively, while females using the GP and W saddles had a 72 % and 33 % incidence. The highest incidence of lower back pain occurred in the GP saddle users who had been riding for more than 15 years (P < 0. 07). The data also indicated a possible tendency for there to be more low back pain among riders using a short stirrup length. No other factors were found to affect the incidence of lower back pain. CONCLUSIONS: The difference in the incidence of lower back pain between the users of the two <b>saddle</b> <b>types</b> {{may be due to the}} additional comfort, cushioning, postural positioning, and stability offered by the design of the deep seated saddle. The results suggest that, while a deep seated saddle is not suited to all equestrian activities, where possible its use should be considered because of its effect in reducing the risk of lower back pain...|$|R
