40|$|DE 10202076 A UPAB: 20031107 NOVELTY - A powder <b>spray</b> <b>arrangement</b> has {{a powder}} channel (4) for {{transporting}} a powder gas mixture, which opens {{out into a}} nozzle opening for distributing the powder-gas mixture {{in the form of}} a cloud. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A powder <b>spray</b> <b>arrangement</b> has a powder channel (4) for transporting a powder gas mixture, which opens out into a nozzle opening for distributing the powder-gas mixture {{in the form of a}} cloud. The channel has a triboelectric active surface which allows the powder to be charged up with a primary polarity. A corona electrode (3) is located before or after the active surface, so a secondary polarity can be produced. The powder channel is in the form of a ring gap or channel and at least one corona electrode is located behind the nozzle opening. A distribution member is located behind the nozzle opening and the corona electrode voltage can be controlled. The triboelectric material is e. g. polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (which produces a positive charge) or polyamide (which produces a negative charge). USE - For use as a powder spraying unit. ADVANTAGE - The powder is charged effectively...|$|E
40|$|In this article, a {{mathematical}} model is formulated to predict the evolution and final geometry of an axisymmetric billet (i. e., round) obtained using an off-axis <b>spray</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The model is formulated by calculating the shape change of a profile curve of a billet surface, based on an axisymmetric surface. On {{the basis of this}} model, a methodology to determine the “shadowing effect ” coefficient is presented. The modeling results suggest that there are three distinct regions in a spray-formed billet: a base transition region, a uniform diameter region, and an upper transition region. The effects of several important processing parameters, such as the withdrawal velocity of substrate, maximum deposition rate, spray distribution coefficient, initial eccentric distance, and rotational velocity of substrate, on the shape factors (e. g., the diameter size of the uniform region and the geometry of the transition regions) are investigated. The mechanisms responsible for the formation of the three distinct regions are discussed. Finally, the model is then implemented and a methodology is formulated to establish optimal processing parameters during spray forming, paying particular attention to deposition efficiency. I. INTRODUCTION processing parameters through experimentation is time-consuming and not economical. Hence, computer simulation i...|$|E
40|$|The safe {{design and}} {{operation}} of Process plants requires an ability to predict hazard consequences reliably. One particular hazard is a jet fire that might arise from the ignition of an accidental release of pressurised gas or liquid. On offshore gas and oil production platforms and also on land-based gas facilities, accidental releases might occur of high pressure natural gas sometimes containing higher molecular weight components. Industries continue to seek efficient and cost-effective means of protecting their plants and personnel from the hazards of fires. Following disasters which occurred in the past, the need for effective mitigation systems has, once again, been highlighted. Mitigation systems involving agents such as halons, which {{are perceived to be}} environmentally damaging, are currently out of favour and interest has revived in the use of water sprays. The research work presented here addresses the problem of the suppression of a compartment jet fire by water sprays. This involved studying the interaction between water spray and a turbulent jet flame inside a compartment of dimension 6 x 2. 4 x 2. 4 m 3. The fuel used for the jet fire was propane emerging from a 2. 0 cm diameter vertical nozzle and at a mass flow rate of 0. 1 kg/s. The objectives of the research are to investigate the mitigation of compartment jet fires by using water sprays by the application of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology incorporating iv Summary combustion and a radiation model to study the jet fire behaviour and the temperature distribution in a compartment. In order to achieve the above objectives, it is necessary to produce a workable CFD model of an offshore module. The radiative heat exchange is considered in the modelling by using the Discrete Transfer Radiation Method (DTRM). The study of the sprays requires details of the individual drops' sizes. The Malvern Particle Sizer was used to measure the drop size of water sprays from the different spray nozzles which have been investigated in this study. The obtained drop sizes of the spray nozzles investigated are used to model the spray in FLUENT, which is a well developed CFD package used in industry and university research. The research started with the CFD modelling of the compartment fire, followed by experimental work done at the university laboratory at Buxton to validate the result of the modelling. In contrast to previous studies in which the combustion reaction was treated as a simple heat source this CFD has included a model of the combustion reaction. Comparisons are made between the experimental data and the predictions of different scenarios (i. e. steady state, different water <b>spray</b> <b>arrangement</b> and time dependent). The predicted temperature distributions from FLUENT, which includes radiation and surface heat transfer, are found to be in close agreement with the experimental data. Modelling results showed that the current version of the CFD code is able to provide a satisfactory and practical means of modelling jet fire and extinguishment processes...|$|E
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{has been}} {{conducting}} re-search to {{determine the influence of}} mining machine mounted water sprays on airflows and methane concentrations at the face when blowing ventilation systems are used. Tests were conducted in a full-scale ventilation gallery. Airflow speeds and directions were measured at several locations near the face with ultrasonic anemometers. Methane was released from the face and concentrations were measured in the entry at locations above the mining machine using fixed point methanometers. Changes in airflow speed, direction, and methane concentrations were correlated with water spray operations. The test results using different <b>spray</b> <b>arrangements</b> and water pressures showed that operation of the machine-mounted sprayers can improve face ventilation effectiveness by increasing the velocity of airflow moving toward and away from the face. The improved ventilation resulted in reduced methane levels near the face...|$|R
40|$|Developments in both {{diagnostic}} and therapeutic applications of microbubbles have greatly increased {{the need for}} more advanced preparation technologies which provide a well-defined, narrow microbubble size-distribution. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of a new device, consisting of a T-junction whose outlet capillary is fitted with an electrohydrodynamic <b>spraying</b> <b>arrangement,</b> to prepare phospholipid-coated air microbubbles, making significant advances in controlling and decreasing the size and size-distribution, and increasing the stability/lifetime of the bubbles prepared. The microbubbles were characterised via optical microscopy to determine the relationship between the size-distribution obtained and the process variables, specifically the flow rates of the phospholipid suspension and air (Q(l) and Q(g)), and the applied voltage (V). The formation of microbubbles in the device was also studied using high-speed photography. For the range of parameters investigated, the bubble diameter was found to scale with the product of the flow rate ratio (Q(l) /Q(g)) and the applied voltage, with a consistent bubble diameter of 5. 1 +/- 2 microm being obtained at Q(l) /Q(g) = 1. 7 and V = 18 kV. The bubbles prepared using this method were found to be stable for at least 2 h at ambient temperature and pressure...|$|R

40|$|Water-in-diesel {{emulsion}} (WiDE) is {{an alternative}} fuel for CI engines that can be employed with the existing engine setup with no additional engine retrofitting. It has benefits of simultaneous reduction of both NOx and particulate matters {{in addition to its}} impact in the combustion efficiency improvement, although this needs further investigation. This review paper addresses the type of emulsion, the microexplosion phenomenon, emulsion stability and physiochemical improvement, and effect of water content on the combustion and emissions of WiDE fuel. The review also covers the recent experimental methodologies used in the investigation of WiDE for both transport and stationary engine applications.

40|$|Automated {{spray guns}} {{are widely used}} in fully {{integrated}} pan-coating systems. Such pan-coating systems are used by the pharmaceutical/food industries to apply aqueous film, solvent and sugar coating for tablets, confectioneries, {{and a variety of}} other products. Typically, pan-coating systems are supplied from the equipment manufacturer fully configured for a desired application. The end user commonly makes necessary changes to the <b>spray</b> gun <b>arrangement</b> in order to accommodate a new application or a change in the coating formulation. Often, these changes do not produce the expected results due to a less than optimal spray gun configuration. Frequently an operator will change the gun operating conditions by simply varying the fluid and gas feeds. As a result, the spray pattern may deteriorate and drop size may increase beyond the desired size thus affecting the final product quality. A standard method for optimizing spray guns used in tablet coating applications does not exist at present. This paper proposes a method that includes an analysis of the critical elements of atomizer testing, consisting of layout and overlap optimization to reduce the errors commonly associated with spray manifold application, such as uneven spray distribution, heavy edges and poor overlap. Furthermore, this approach will also consider the effects of “normal ” operating parameters such as fluid flow rate, atomization pressure and gun-to-target distance on spray-pattern uniformity, drop size, and velocity...|$|R
40|$|A giberela, causada pelo fungo Gibberella zeae (Fusarium graminearum), é uma importante doença de infecção floral do trigo. Para controlar essa doença, o fungicida deve ser aplicado durante a antese, de modo a proteger as anteras. Os objetivos do presente trabalho foram de construir uma barra de pulverização que permitiu utilizar bicos em diferentes arranjos e quantificar a presença de corante nas anteras quando aplicado com diferentes pontas de pulverização, direções dos bicos na barra e com diferentes volumes de calda. Utilizaram-se pontas de jato plano (XR- 11002), jato plano duplo (110 DB 2) e jato cônico vazio (JA- 2), espaçadas em 0, 50 m, em uma barra tradicional e numa barra modificada. Na barra modificada, foram utilizados corpos duplos giratórios, posicionando-se os bicos na {{vertical}}, 30 º ou 45 º para frente e para trás em relação à vertical. Os resultados mostraram que a utilização de dois bicos no mesmo ponto da barra aumentou significativamente o número de anteras que receberam o fungicida. As três pontas de pulverização comportaram-se de maneira semelhante. Dois bicos formando ângulo de 30 º em relação à vertical proporcionaram a mesma quantidade de anteras cobertas com corante do que dois bicos posicionados n{{a vertical}}. A angulação dos bicos em 45 º com a vertical proporcionou maior número de anteras atingidas pela calda.

The nozzle types used were flat fan, twin flat fan, and hollow cone. A total of four experiments were carried out. The deposition of color dye was higher on loose than on trapped anthers. The double nozzle sets resulted in increased spray volumes (200 to 400 L ha- 1) and higher numbers of fungicide sprayed anthers. The nozzle types {{did not differ from}} each other.
