5|$|These growing {{tensions}} between Henry and Louis finally {{spilled over into}} open war in 1167, triggered by a trivial argument over how money destined for the Crusader states of the Levant should be collected.

Both Mercedes drivers and Verstappen made their second pitstops by lap 20, with the order remaining the same. On lap 21, Ricciardo moved ahead of Pérez into fourth position. A mistake by Räikkönen two laps later saw him lose sixth place to Sainz. Fernando Alonso spun on lap 25, but was able to continue, unlike Rio Haryanto, who retired following a spin one lap later. Hamilton retained the lead, but not without problems, as {{he also had a}} short excursion off the track, which was mirrored by Verstappen behind him. As a result, the top three moved closer together. Vettel was <b>still</b> <b>running</b> at the back end of the point-scoring positions, overtaking Kvyat for ninth on lap 29.|$|E
