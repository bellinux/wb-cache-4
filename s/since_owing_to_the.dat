Therefore, Spencer concluded, religion and science agree in the supreme truth that the human understanding is only capable of 'relative' knowledge. This is the case <b>since,</b> <b>owing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inherent limitations of the human mind, it is only possible to obtain knowledge of phenomena, not of the reality ('the absolute') underlying phenomena.

60|$|It was dawn on the {{following}} morning before we sighted the oasis, whither we could travel but slowly, <b>since,</b> <b>owing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lack of camels, two of us must walk. Of these two, as may be guessed, the Sergeant was always one and his master the other, for of all the men I ever knew I think that in such matters Orme is the most unselfish. Nothing would induce him to mount one of the camels, even for half-an-hour, so that when I walked, the brute went riderless. On the other hand, once he was on, notwithstanding the agonies he suffered from his soreness, nothing would induce Higgs to get off.|$|E
60|$|<b>Since,</b> <b>owing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{overhanging}} conformation of the place, it {{was quite}} impossible for us to descend in front where pressure had made the snow hard as stone, we were obliged to risk a march over the looser material upon its flank. As {{there was nothing to}} be gained by waiting, off we went, Leo leading and step by step trying the snow. To our joy we discovered that the sharp night frost had so hardened its surface that it would support us. About half way down, however, where the pressure had been less, it became much softer, so that we were forced to lie upon our faces, which enabled us to distribute our weight over a larger surface, and thus slither gently down the hill.|$|E

Also, here the tide or the current, or both, ran {{with the speed}} of a mill-race, so that in places the sea bubbled and swirled like a boiling kettle. However skilled and strong he might be, it was hard for one man to deal with such {{difficulties}} and escape disaster. Still following the port side of the ship, <b>since</b> <b>owing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> presence of certain rocks he dared not attempt the direct starboard passage, he came at last to her stern.

6000|$|About {{ten o'clock}} in the morning Colonel Durnford, whom I have {{mentioned}} already, rode up with five hundred Natal Zulus, about half of whom were mounted, and two rocket tubes which, of course, were worked by white men. This was after a patrol had reported that they had come into touch with some Zulus on the left front, who retired before them. As a matter of fact these Zulus were foraging in the mealie fields, <b>since</b> <b>owing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drought food was very scarce in Zululand that year and the regiments were hungry. I happened to see the meeting between Colonel Pulleine, a short, stout man who was then in command of the camp, and Colonel Durnford who, as his senior officer, took it over from him, and heard Colonel Pulleine say that his orders were [...] "to defend the camp," [...] but what else passed between them I do not know.|$|E

Although natural gas represented about 40% of Malaysiaâ€™s energy consumption in 2008, there have been gas shortages <b>since</b> 2009, <b>owing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> combination of a declining domestic gas supply and rising demand. <b>To</b> compound matters, <b>the</b> sharp drop in global oil prices between July and December 2014 forced <b>the</b> government <b>to</b> cut expenditure in January 2015 to maintain its budget deficit at 3%.

Then, after moonrise, when all are asleep, these fifty must rush the cattle kraal, killing any who may oppose them, should they be seen, and driving the herd out through yonder great pass by which we have entered the land. Bangu and his people, thinking that those who have taken the cattle are but common thieves of some wild tribe, will gather and follow the beasts to recapture them. But we, with the rest of the Amangwane, can set an ambush in the narrowest part of the pass among the rocks, where the grass is high and the euphorbia trees grow thick, and there, when they have passed the Nek, which I and my hunters will hold with our guns, we will give them battle.

We test for the presence of herding as suggested by Christie and Huang (1995) and Chang, Cheng, and Khorana (2000). Results based on daily, weekly and monthly data indicate the existence of herd behaviour for the years 1998 - 2007. Evidence of herd behaviour over daily time intervals is much stronger, revealing the short-term nature of the phenomenon. When the testing period is broken into semi-annual sub-periods, herding is found during the stock market crisis of 1999.

[...] In an unusual meeting {{of old and new}} transport technology, the pillars supporting the flyovers over the Birmingham Canal Navigations had to be carefully placed to enable a horse-drawn canal boat to pass under the interchange without fouling the towing rope. The junction has undergone major repair work several times <b>since,</b> <b>owing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> very heavy traffic through the junction, and some alleged cost-saving measures during its construction. In November 2007, a sliproad running from the Tyburn Road onto the Aston Expressway was closed to undergo urgent repair works. Upon inspection, it was found that Spaghetti Junction itself was in need of repair work because salt and grit had weakened the joints in the structure.|$|E

40|$|In modern {{metal matrix}} and ceramic matrix {{composites}} fiber-matrix interphases are specially designed <b>to</b> improve <b>the</b> fracture toughness of a composite, {{and to prevent}} fiber-matrix chemical reaction.

Ultrasonic scattering from such interphases carries important information on the fiber itself and its bonding with the surrounding matrix material, thus having potential for fiber-matrix interphase characterization. Much work has been done on the study of wave scattering from cylindrical objects embedded in elastic media <b>since</b> 1950, <b>owing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> importance of the subject [1 â€“ 6].

40|$|Islamic {{resurgence}} is not {{a recent}} phenomenon. Islam possesses a long tradition revival (Tajdid) and reform (Islah), dating from the early Islamic centuries to the present day. It had different forms that gripped the whole Muslim world in less or more acute form. This work identified three periods of resurgence {{in the history of}} Islam, Pre Modern or Islamic Revivalism, Modern or Islamic Reformism and Neo-Modern or Islamic Radicalism. Tajikistan remained part and parcel of their region while sharing a historical twirl, common faith and civilization with Muslims {{in the rest of the}} world. After passing through the period of Islamic revivalism and Islamic reformism Tajikistan has entered its third period of Islamic resurgence and that is Islamic radicalism This work emphasized the third phase of the Islamic resurgence. In the period of radicalization of Islam in Tajikistan, two issues must be separated, Islamic survival and Islamic revivalism. The Soviet period can be termed as Islamic survival; despite soviets atheist propaganda, religion remains the major identity of the people because like every Muslim of the world, Islam is part of Tajik culture. The last ten years of the Soviet Union can be called the time of Islamic revival. With internal there are external factors that give a new shape to the Islam in Tajikistan and it is labeled as radical Islam, extreme Islam, militant Islam or fundamentalists. This is purely an external dimension and not the out growth of traditional, tolerant, and moderate Central Asian Islam. The internal factors for the revival of Islam in Tajikistan resulted in the acceptance of the external influence. The post 9 / 11 developments are indicative of resurgence of nationalism in the region, but in Tajikistan Islamic forces seems to have brighter prospects. <b>since</b> <b>owing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fragmentary nature of Tajik national identity, Islam can emerge as the only stabilizing factor, an anchor and reference to which mass mobilisation can coalesce around.
