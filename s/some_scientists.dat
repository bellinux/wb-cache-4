5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the IAU definition of dwarf planet, <b>some</b> <b>scientists</b> expressed their disagreement with the IAU resolution. Campaigns included car bumper stickers and T-shirts. Mike Brown (the discoverer of Eris) agrees with the reduction of the number of planets to eight.|$|E
5|$|Long-term secular {{change in}} sunspot number is thought, by <b>some</b> <b>scientists,</b> to be {{correlated}} with long-term change in solar irradiance, which, in turn, might influence Earth's long-term climate.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Soviet military–industrial complex also opposed a test ban, though <b>some</b> <b>scientists,</b> {{including}} Igor Kurchatov, were {{supportive of}} antinuclear efforts. France, {{which was in}} the midst of developing its own nuclear weapon, also firmly opposed a test ban in the late 1950s.|$|E

5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>scientists</b> have {{hypothesized}} {{that the development of}} monothecate anthers and larger flowers (compared to those of the remaining genera in Durioneae) in the clade consisting of Durio, Boschia, and Cullenia was in conjunction with a transition from beetle pollination to vertebrate pollination.|$|E

5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>scientists</b> include Xenotarsosaurus from Argentina and Compsosuchus from India as basal abelisaurids, {{while others}} {{consider}} {{them to be}} outside Abelisauroidea. The French Genusaurus and Tarascosaurus have also been called abelisaurids but both are fragmentary and may be more basal ceratosaurians.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>scientists</b> regard {{other species}} as valid as well, for example P.erlenbergensis. Such works, however, ignore Moser (2003), the {{publication}} {{that shows the}} type series of P.engelhardti to be diagnostic, and other material to be referable to it.|$|E
5|$|Autism is a {{disorder}} that {{is associated with}} social and communicative deficits. A single cause of autism has yet to be identified, but the mu wave and mirror neuron system have been studied specifically for their role in the disorder. In a typically developing individual, the mirror neuron system responds when he or she either watches someone perform a task or performs the task him- or herself. In individuals with autism, mirror neurons become active (and consequently mu waves are suppressed) only when the individual performs the task him- or herself. This finding has led <b>some</b> <b>scientists,</b> notably V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues, to view autism as disordered understanding of other individuals' intentions and goals due to problems with the mirror neuron system. This deficiency would explain the difficulty people with autism have in communicating with and understanding others. While most studies of the mirror neuron system and mu waves in people with autism have focused on simple motor tasks, <b>some</b> <b>scientists</b> speculate that these tests can be expanded to show that problems with the mirror neuron system underlie overarching cognitive and social deficits.|$|E

5|$|Ceratopsid teeth, {{including}} those of Styracosaurus, were arranged in groups called batteries. Older teeth on top were continually replaced by the teeth underneath them. Unlike hadrosaurids, which also had dental batteries, ceratopsid teeth sliced but did not grind. <b>Some</b> <b>scientists</b> have suggested that ceratopsids like Styracosaurus ate palms and cycads, while others have suggested ferns. Dodson has proposed that Late Cretaceous ceratopsians may have knocked down angiosperm trees and then sheared off leaves and twigs.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{forecasting}} {{is a way}} by <b>some</b> <b>scientists</b> {{are using}} to predict climate change. In 1997 the prediction division of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University began generating seasonal climate forecasts on a real-time basis. To produce these forecasts an extensive suite of forecasting tools was developed, including a multimodel ensemble approach that required thorough validation of each model's accuracy level in simulating interannual climate variability.|$|E
5|$|Creating {{a native}} pet {{industry}} in Australia related to quolls could aid in their conservation. However, concerns exist about this methodology {{in regards to}} animal husbandry, conservation benefits, and other issues. <b>Some</b> <b>scientists</b> believe that keeping quolls as pets could aid in their long-term conservation, but {{further research is needed}} on this topic to conclude whether this is true or false.|$|E

5|$|Dromaeosauroides {{has been}} {{considered}} an indeterminate dromaeosaur by <b>some</b> <b>scientists.</b> Bonde responded that since the teeth {{differ from those of}} other dromaeosaurs from the Early Cretaceous (and later members of the group, including Dromaeosaurus), it should be considered valid. He also said that these scientists had provided incorrect information about the location, strata and age of the specimen, and that the circumstances of its naming were no different from those of other tooth-based taxa.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a {{quicksand}} predator trap {{was discovered}} containing multiple Utahraptor specimens {{ranging in age}} from fully grown adult to tiny 3 foot long baby. <b>Some</b> <b>scientists</b> have hypothesized this is evidence of family hunting behaviour, however the full sandstone block is yet to be opened and researchers are unsure {{as to whether or not}} the animals died at the same time or not.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{are unsure}} {{of the purpose of}} whale songs. Only males sing, {{suggesting}} one purpose is to attract females. However, many of the whales observed to approach a singer are other males, often resulting in conflict. Singing may, therefore, be a challenge to other males. <b>Some</b> <b>scientists</b> have hypothesized the song may serve an echolocative function. During the feeding season, humpbacks make unrelated vocalizations for herding fish into their bubble nets.|$|E

5|$|The asteroids are not {{samples of}} the {{primordial}} Solar System. They have undergone considerable evolution since their formation, including internal heating (in the first few {{tens of millions of}} years), surface melting from impacts, space weathering from radiation, and bombardment by micrometeorites. Although <b>some</b> <b>scientists</b> refer to the asteroids as residual planetesimals, other scientists consider them distinct.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the dark patches, which mainly occur on the leading {{hemisphere}} and inside craters, is not known. <b>Some</b> <b>scientists</b> hypothesized that they are of cryovolcanic origin (analogs of lunar maria), while others think that the impacts excavated dark material buried beneath the pure ice (crust). In the latter case Oberon {{should be at least}} partially differentiated, with the ice crust lying atop the non-differentiated interior.|$|E
5|$|The risk {{assessments}} of catastrophic scenarios at the LHC sparked public fears, and <b>some</b> <b>scientists</b> {{associated with the}} project received protests - the Large Hadron Collider team revealed that they had received death threats and threatening emails and phone calls demanding the experiment be halted. , Romania's Conservative Party held a protest before the European Commission mission to Bucharest, demanding that the experiment be halted because it feared that the LHC could create dangerous black holes.|$|E
