40|$|Graphitic {{electrodes}} find {{widespread use}} throughout electrochemistry; understanding their fundamental electrochemical properties is imperative. It is widely thought that graphite edge <b>plane</b> <b>sites</b> exhibit faster rates of electron transfer {{as compared to}} basal <b>plane</b> <b>sites.</b> Hitherto the different rates of electron transfer at the edge and basal sites have been inferred indirectly using diffusional systems. To avoid possible complications we alternatively study a surface-bound system to simplify the interpretation. The voltammetric response of graphitic-surface-bound anthraquinone monosulfonate (AQMS) with varying pH, reveals two distinct voltammetric responses, ascribed as being due to the basal and edge plane sites; where the pK(a)  s associated with the reduced anthraquinone are found to differ for the two sites. Through modelling of the system based upon a "scheme of squares" mechanism {{it is possible to}} conclude that both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the species differ in the two environments in which the rate of electron transfer at the basal <b>plane</b> <b>site</b> is shown to be 2 - 3 orders of magnitude slower than that of the edge <b>plane</b> <b>site.</b> This work provides the first example of a voltammetric response which is purely due to electron transfer at a basal <b>plane</b> <b>site.</b> Further, we believe {{this is the first time}} a full "scheme of squares" model has been used for the quantitative analysis of a diffusionless 2 H(+) 2 e(-) system...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{operational}} model {{to estimate the}} actual evapotranspiration (ET) of crops cultivated on hilly terrains. This new model has the following three characteristics: (1) ET modelling {{is based on a}} Penman-Monteith (PM) type equation (Monteith 1965) where canopy resistance is simulated by following an approach already illustrated by Katerji and Perrier (Agronomie 3 (6) : 513 - 521, 1983); (2) the estimation of ET, by means of the PM equation, is made by using meteorological variables simulated on sloped sites as input; (3) these variables are simulated by using simple relationships linking the variables measured at a reference <b>site</b> on <b>plane</b> to the topographic characteristics of the site (slope, orientation, altitude as difference between reference, and sloped sites). This approach presents two advantages if compared with previously proposed models: Not only computation steps are greatly simplified but also error sources due to the simulation of climatic variables in sloped sites and the ET estimation are well distinguished. This model was validated at hourly and daily scales at four sites cultivated with wheat and oats offering a wide range of slope and orientation values: a reference <b>site</b> on <b>plane,</b> <b>site</b> 1 (9 A degrees sloping, NW orientation, 7 m from the reference <b>site</b> in <b>plane),</b> <b>site</b> 2 (6 A degrees, SE, 12 m) and site 3 (1 A degrees, SE, 18 m). At hourly scale, the new model performed well at all sites studied. The observed slope of the linear relationships between estimated and measured ET values ranged between 0. 93 and 1. 03, with coefficients of determination, r (2), between 0. 80 and 0. 98. At daily scale, the slopes of the linear relationships between measured and estimated ET for the <b>sites</b> on <b>plane</b> and the sloped sites were practically the same (0. 98 A +/- 0. 01); however, the coefficient of determination r (2) observed in the <b>site</b> on <b>plane</b> was clearly greater (0. 98) than that observed in the sloped sites (0. 83). The presented analysis does not show any significant systematic effect of topography (slope and orientation of the plots) on the good performance of the proposed model for the ET estimation. Furthermore, we observed that coefficients of determination tend to decrease with the increase in the slope of the site, which translates into increased inaccuracy of the climatic variables simulation, in particular the net radiation, as the slope of the site increases. The proposed model allows to verify the different steps for calculating the fluxes, to identify the eventual sources of error and to make the needed corrections. For this reasons, the proposed model seems to be particularly "operational", i. e. a useful tool for estimating fluxes on hilly terrains...|$|R

40|$|The electrocatalytic {{properties}} of multi-walled carbon nanotube modified electrodes toward the oxidation of NADH are critically evaluated. Carbon nanotube modified electrodes are examined and compared with boron-doped diamond and glassy carbon electrodes, and most importantly, edge plane and basal pyrolytic graphite electrodes. It is found that CNT modified electrodes {{are no more}} reactive than edge plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes with the comparison with edge plane and basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes allowing the electroactive sites for the electrochemical oxidation of NADH to be unambiguously determined as due to edge <b>plane</b> <b>sites.</b> Using these highly reactive edge <b>plane</b> <b>sites,</b> edge <b>plane</b> pyrolytic graphite electrodes are examined with cyclic voltammetry and amperometry for the electroanalytical determination of NADH. It is demonstrated that a detection limit of 5 microM is possible with cyclic voltammetry or 0. 3 microM using amperometry suggesting that edge plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes can conveniently replace carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon electrodes for biosensing applications with the relative advantages of reactivity, cost and simplicity of preparation. We advocate the routine use of edge plane and basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes in studies utilising carbon nanotubes particularly if 'electrocatalytic' properties are claimed for the latter...|$|R

40|$|Three {{integral}} membrane proteins, clau- din- 1, - 2, and occludin, {{are known}} to be components of tight junction (TJ) strands. To examine their ability to form TJ strands, their cDNAs were introduced into mouse L fibroblasts lacking TJs. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that both FLAG-tagged claudin- 1 and - 2 were highly concentrated at cell contact <b>sites</b> as <b>planes</b> through a homophilic interaction. In freeze-fracture replicas of these contact sites, well-developed networks of strands were identified that were similar to TJ strand networks in situ and were specifically labeled with anti-FLAG mAb. In glutaraldehyde-fixed samples, claudin- 1 –induced strands were largely associated with the protoplasmic (P) face as mostly continuous structures, whereas claudin- 2 –induced strands were discontinuous at the P face with complementary grooves at the extracellular (E) face which were occupied by chains of particles. Although occludin was also concentrated at cell contact sites as dots through its homophilic interaction, freeze-fracture replicas identified {{only a small number of}} short strands that were labeled with anti-occludin mAb. However, when occludin was cotransfected with claudin- 1, it was concentrated at cell contact <b>sites</b> as <b>planes</b> to be incorporated into well- developed claudin- 1 –based strands. These findings suggested that claudin- 1 and - 2 are mainly responsible for TJ strand formation, and that occludin is an accessory protein in some function of TJ strands...|$|R

40|$|The role {{of oxygen}} {{functionalities}} and edge <b>plane</b> <b>sites</b> on disposable screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE) was evaluated for simultaneous determination of dopamine, uric acid and ascorbic acid in this study. Both electrochemically preanodized and oxygen plasma treated SPCEs were adopted {{for the purpose}} of partially differentiating these two effects. Raman and XPS analyses verify that different treatment can indeed induce different surface characteristics. The electrocatalytic activity thereby increases by the substantial increase in surface bound carbon-oxygen functional groups and/or the generation of edge <b>plane</b> <b>sites</b> through surface reorientation. Possible mechanism is proposed to explain the voltammetric behavior. The peaks for dopamine, uric acid and ascorbic acid are especially well-resolved from each other at the electrochemically preanodized SPCE and simultaneous detection at neutral pH can thus be obtained by this simple approach.
