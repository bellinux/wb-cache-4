It is obvious, therefore, that the dip, when used at a strength of 0. 3 per cent., cannot always be relied upon to cure animals of scab, and should, in the interests of safety, be avoided at all stages in the process of dipping.

Clinical signs were reported, morbidity rates were estimated and the total mortalities were recorded. Clinically, the disease was characterized by fever, depression and eruption of generalized pox lesions. Mortality rate ranged between 5. 2 and 6. 7 {{with a mean of}} 6. 1. All age, sex and breed groups were affected. However, more than 50 % of deaths were reported in young animals in comparison to adult <b>sheep.</b> Skin <b>Scabs</b> were collected from sick animals, homogenized and inoculated in cell culture and embryonated eggs. Two virus isolates were obtained when 4 skin samples were inoculated onto Lamb testes (LT) cell culture. These viruses as well as one previous isolate of sheeppox virus (SP 4) and the vaccine strain 0240 induced no lesions on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of embryonated chicken eggs. On the other hand, sheeppox and goatpox isolates grew well in lamb testes (LT) cell culture with no difference in virus yield or type of CPE produced by the two viruses. In Vero cells, both viruses produced more than 90 % CPE within 7 days PI. In MDBK however, both viruses induced slight CPE that reached 60 % in 9 days. On the other hand, both viruses induced no CPE in chick embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells. Titration of an isolate of sheeppox virus (SP 1 O) was performed in Vero cells and resulted in a titer of 105. 2 /ml. The same virus was identified as sheeppox in virus neutralization test with 1. 4 neutralization index. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used in this study to determine the feasibility of improving diagnosis of sheep pox and goat pox in scabs collected from the field as well as in supernatant of infected cell cultures. Three methods of DNA extraction were tried. The first method (PCR 1) employed no DNA extraction step with scab homogenate or cell culture supernatant added directly to the PCR mix.

5000|$|Cattle {{ranching}} {{was already}} a well established trade in Texas by 1870, when shepherding was starting to become popular {{in other parts of}} the Old West. Because of this, whether in Texas or elsewhere, many cattlemen had close relationships with local government figures and they were able to use this influence to their advantage. According to one Texas historian, [...] "In court action, the cowboy cattleman usually won." [...] The sheepherders were always considered the weaker, or lesser, of the antagonists. They were often advocates of free grazing on public land, while the cattlemen typically fenced off the territory whether it was public or private land. There were many reasons why a cattle rancher would build fences, mostly it was to mark boundaries, prevent rustling, and to keep other people from grazing their animals there. Furthermore, there was also the threat of <b>sheep</b> <b>scab.</b> Building fences across the range infuriated the sheep herders, as well as open range cattlemen, so conflicts like the Fence Cutting War became almost inevitable. Racism was also a factor, being that many of the shepherds were either Hispanic or Native American. One of the earliest sheep wars was fought in 1875, in the Charles Goodnight range, along the Texas-New Mexico border. Later, sheep wars occurred in the central and West Texas counties of Schleicher, Nolan, Brown, Crane, Tom Green, San Saba and Coleman.|$|E
50|$|The {{clinical}} {{manifestation of}} infestation with psoroptic mites is usually called mange and sometimes scabies, but the skin disease of sheep caused by Psoroptes ovis is often {{known locally as}} <b>sheep</b> <b>scab.</b> This species may affect its hosts severely enough to reduce their gain in weight. Costs to farmers of controlling sheep-scab in Britain were at Â£8 million (US$12 million) annually in 2005. Transmission between hosts is readily accomplished by contagion during flocking contact and also on fomites such as scraps of sheep's wool because these relatively large and robust mites can survive for one to two weeks off their host. Psoroptes ovis infests the superficial layers of the skin. Irritation of the outer skin by the mite's mouthparts and saliva results in a complex form of cutaneous hypersensitivity and inflammatory exudation of serum and fresh cells. The mites feed on this moist exudate. The skin loses its hair (depilation) at the sites of infestation {{and this may be}} extensive. As a result of the movement of the mites into areas of fresh skin, large scabs accumulate on the raw skin left behind. The mites cause intense pruritus (itching). In cases of heavy infestations, the host grooms compulsively, aggravating the depilation, and it may become mentally distressed. Psoroptes ovis infests sheep worldwide and can be a serious welfare and animal-production problem for sheep farmers.Infestations of cattle with mites of the similar genus Chorioptes, in combination with Sarcoptes mite infestation, has been shown to cause a failure to gain body weight by 15.5 kg to 37.2 kg over a two-month period compared to cattle without the mites.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Sheep</b> <b>scab</b> is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} disease of sheep caused by the ectoparasitic mite Psoroptes ovis. The disease is endemic in the UK and has significant economic impact through its effects on performance and welfare. Diagnosis of <b>sheep</b> <b>scab</b> is achieved through observation of clinical signs e. g. itching, pruritis and wool loss and ultimately through the detection of mites in skin scrapings. Early stages of infestation are often difficult to diagnose and sub-clinical animals can be {{a major factor in}} disease spread. The development of a diagnostic assay would enable farmers and veterinarians to detect disease at an early stage, reducing the risk of developing clinical disease and limiting spread. Methods Serum samples were obtained from an outbreak of <b>sheep</b> <b>scab</b> within an experimental flock (n = 480 (3 samples each from 160 sheep)) allowing the assessment, by ELISA of <b>sheep</b> <b>scab</b> specific antibody prior to infestation, mid-outbreak (combined with clinical assessment) and post-treatment. Results Analysis of pre-infestation samples demonstrated low levels of potential false positives (3. 8 %). Of the 27 animals with clinical or behavioural signs of disease 25 tested positive at the mid-outbreak sampling period, however, the remaining 2 sheep tested positive at the subsequent sampling period. Clinical assessment revealed the absence of clinical or behavioural signs of disease in 132 sheep, whilst analysis of mid-outbreak samples showed that 105 of these clinically negative animals were serologically positive, representing potential sub-clinical infestations. Conclusions This study demonstrates that this ELISA test can effectively diagnose <b>sheep</b> <b>scab</b> in a natural outbreak of disease, and more importantly, highlights its ability to detect sub-clinically infested animals. This ELISA, employing a single recombinant antigen, represents a major step forward in the diagnosis of <b>sheep</b> <b>scab</b> and may prove to be critical in any future control program. </p...|$|E

40|$|THE astigmatid mite Psoroptes ovis is a {{globally}} distributed obli-gate ectoparasite of sheep, {{cattle and}} several other mammals.

40|$|Despite {{attempts}} to control <b>sheep</b> <b>scab,</b> it remains {{a problem in the}} UK. The disease is controlled by chemical dips, but these have several drawbacks. Certain strains of the causative agent, Psoroptes avis, are developing resistance to these, and there are also concerns over their safety. Clearly, an alternative control method is needed, with one possibility being avaccine. !- In this project, a variety of molecular and proteomic techniques were utilised to identify candidate vaccine antigens for the control of <b>sheep</b> <b>scab.</b> Cysteine proteases were found to be highly active in mite extracts, and cathepsin B was localised {{to the surface of the}} mit~' s gut, suggesting a role in digestion and making it a putative hidden antigen. Antioxidant activity was investigated in mite extracts, and recombinant proteins were expressed. Thioredoxin peroxidase was localised to an area around the mite's pharynx, which could represent salivary glands; and was also recognised by sera from sheep infected with P. avis. This suggests this enzyme may be secreted by the mite and interact with the host immune response in some way. A suppressive subtractive hybridisation study was carried out to identify genes upregulated ' by mites during feeding, and thus may encode proteins involved in digestion. This identified a number of interesting genes, including homologues of house dust mite antigens, salivary gland proteins and proteins with possible roles in immunomodulation. An in situ hybridisation protocol was used on mite sections to localise mRNA of several genes characterised elsewhere in this study. Although this technique was not entirely successful, there were some positive results which provide the groundwork for future {{attempts to}} optimise this technique in this parasite.

40|$|Abstract Background Infestation of ovine {{skin with}} the ectoparasitic mite Psoroptes ovis {{results in a}} rapid {{cutaneous}} immune response, leading to the crusted skin lesions characteristic of <b>sheep</b> <b>scab.</b> Little is known regarding the mechanisms by which such a profound inflammatory response is instigated and to identify novel vaccine and drug targets {{a better understanding of}} the host-parasite relationship is essential. The main objective of this study was to perform a combined network and pathway analysis of the in vivo skin response to infestation with P. ovis to gain a clearer understanding of the mechanisms and signalling pathways involved. Results Infestation with P. ovis resulted in differential expression of 1, 552 genes over a 24 hour time course. Clustering by peak gene expression enabled classification of genes into temporally related groupings. Network and pathway analysis of clusters identified key signalling pathways involved in the host response to infestation. The analysis implicated a number of genes with roles in allergy and inflammation, including pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL 1 A, IL 1 B, IL 6, IL 8 and TNF) and factors involved in immune cell activation and recruitment (SELE, SELL, SELP, ICAM 1, CSF 2, CSF 3, CCL 2 and CXCL 2). The analysis also highlighted the influence of the transcription factors NF-kB and AP- 1 in the early pro-inflammatory response, and demonstrated a bias towards a Th 2 type immune response. Conclusions This study has provided novel insights into the signalling mechanisms leading to the development of a pro-inflammatory response in <b>sheep</b> <b>scab,</b> whilst providing crucial information regarding the nature of mite factors that may trigger this response. It has enabled the elucidation of the temporal patterns by which the immune system is regulated following exposure to P. ovis, providing novel insights into the mechanisms underlying lesion development.

40|$|<b>Sheep</b> <b>scab</b> is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} ectoparasitic disease caused by the mite, Psoroptes ovis, which causes intensely pruritic lesions with severe dermatitis and is a major welfare and production issue in the UK national flock. In an attempt to improve disease control, <b>sheep</b> <b>scab</b> was recently made notifiable in Scotland indicating that early diagnostic tests will be crucial {{to the success of}} this legislation. A sensitive and specific antibody based assay has been developed which can diagnose early infestation, but which does not indicate current disease status post-treatment due to residual circulating antibody levels. However, studies into host biology and response to disease have illustrated the potential use of biomarkers (BMs) in diagnostics as indicators of disease progression and the effectiveness of treatment regimes, including a recent microarray analysis which identified over 600 host genes differentially expressed in circulating leukocytes following P. ovis infestation. As many of these genes encoded proteins known to be involved in inflammatory responses, this data was used in the search for potential BMs. Initially the genes were filtered and ranked, using bioinformatic analysis, to identify the most promising BM candidates and then evaluated using Western blot analysis against a range of sera from P. ovis infested and naÃ¯ve sheep. Promising results were obtained for a complement binding protein, C 4 BPB, showing it was rapidly up-regulated following infestation and correlated with disease progression as determined by lesion size development. The ovine C 4 BPB gene was successfully sequenced {{for the first time and}} a recombinant form of this protein expressed in E. coli. Antibodies, raised in rabbits against ovine rC 4 BPB, were used to develop a sandwich ELISA, results from which suggested the potential of C 4 BPB as a BM for <b>sheep</b> <b>scab</b> as it indicated current disease status postinfestation and post-treatment. The major ruminant acute phase proteins (APPs) serum amyloid A (SAA) and haptoglobin (Hp) were then investigated using commercially available assays, as previous studies indicated they were effective markers of inflammatory disease in ruminants. Results from these analyses indicated that both APPs responded positively to infestation with P. ovis but this was not statistically significant until 4 weeks post-infestation. After treatment, the APPs declined rapidly, as described by their short half life of less than 3 days following successful treatment, compared with 56 days for the estimated half life of the host antibody against the mite antigen Pso o 2. Further statistical analysis of the APP response suggested that SAA was the more discriminatory marker, with lower pre-infestation levels and higher sensitivity at the estimated optimum cut-off values. The possibility of using a signature of BMs, as an alternative to a single BM, was discussed as a method of increasing the sensitivity and specificity of the improved test, along with the potential of combining the BM diagnostic with the existing antibody assay. It was concluded that this would provide a highly sensitive and specific test for <b>sheep</b> <b>scab</b> which would diagnose early infestation as well as indicating current disease status post-treatment, providing a highly beneficial tool to the sheep industry to aid the control of this disease...|$|E
40|$|Psoroptes ovis mites are the causative parasites of <b>sheep</b> <b>scab</b> disease. It is a {{contagious}} disease which causes intense pruritus, wool loss {{and the development}} of lesions. These lesions are exacerbated by secondary bacterial infections. Bacteria appear to play an integrated role in the pathogenicity of this disease and are found in the internal cavities of P. ovis. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate these bacterial associations, with the aim of identifying a microbial target for <b>sheep</b> <b>scab</b> control. The microbial communities associated with <b>sheep</b> <b>scab</b> were investigated using both molecular and bacteriological techniques. Several environmental niches were targeted: scab-infected fleece, internal mite cavity and excreted faecal trails. Microbial communities were very complex, with a variety of species and bacterial groups identified. Some bacteria were common to all environments, whereas others were isolated from one sample. Both natural and in vivo cultured mites were investigated in an attempt to identify universal and potentially beneficial bacteria. In addition, P. ovis mites were screened using PCR to detect potential endosymbiotic bacteria. Positive identification was made of Comamonas sp. in both natural and in vivo cultured mites; this species has been identified as an endosymbiont in other arthropods and its role in P. ovis requires further investigation. In vitro feeding experiments were carried out with P. ovis mites in the laboratory. Initially mite chambers were constructed and optimised to encourage maintenance of P. ovis off-host. A number of diets were tested and antibiotics were compared for their effect on bacteria within P. ovis. In vitro experiments revealed that P. ovis survival was significantly reduced with the administration of antibiotics and there was also evidence that they altered internal bacterial densities. The potential of bacteriophage therapy for the microbial control of bacteria associated with P. ovis was investigated. Bacteria isolated from P. ovis faecal trails were used to isolate bacteriophage from environmental samples. Sixteen bacteriophage were successfully isolated, which were infective against three mite faecal bacteria. Isolated bacteriophage were characterised by a number of methods including their response to chemicals, enzyme and infection dynamics in both solid and liquid phases. In vitro experiments with bacteriophage were also investigated, resulting in a significantly reduced mite lifespan seen with some bacteriophage lysates. The potential for using bacteriophage for the control of P. ovis mites is discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
