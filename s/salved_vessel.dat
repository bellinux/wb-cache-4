Legal disputes do arise from the claiming of salvage rights. To reduce the amount of a claim after an accident, boat owners or skippers often remain on board and in command of the vessel; they do everything possible to minimise further loss and seek to minimize the degree of risk the vessel is in. If another vessel offers a tow and the master or owner negotiates an hourly rate before accepting then salvage does not apply.|$|E

[...] Typically, the ship and the salvor will sign up to an LOF agreement so that the terms of salvage are clear. [...] Since 2000, it has become standard to append a SCOPIC clause to the LOF, so as to circumvent the limitations of the [...] "Special Compensation" [...] provisions of the 1989 Convention (pursuant to the case of the Nagasaki Spirit).|$|R
