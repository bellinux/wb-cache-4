However, later that year, due to an unexpected illness, he had to cancel a 22-date North American tour that was due to start on 26 June. Jansch's website reported: [...] "Bert is very <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> missing the tour, and apologises to all the fans who were hoping to see him. He {{is looking forward to}} rescheduling as soon as possible." ...|$|E

I am deeply <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately." [...] Sesame Workshop also released a statement: [...] "Unfortunately, the controversy surrounding Kevin's personal life has become a distraction that none of us want, and he has concluded that he can no longer be effective in his job and has {{resigned from}} 'Sesame Street.'" [...] They stated that other puppeteers had been trained to serve as Clash's understudy and would take over his roles on the show.|$|E
500|$|Having {{originally}} {{agreed to}} serve {{for a year}} Gleeson wrote to Father Bernard Rawlinson, the senior Roman Catholic chaplain, in October 1915 requesting that he be relieved of duty stating that [...] "I am <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> leaving the dear old Munster lads, but I really can't stand it any longer. I {{do not like the}} life, though I love the poor men ever so much". He became a curate at the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes in Dublin but requested permission from his Archbishop, William Walsh, to return to army service for another year. He was recommissioned in his previous rank on 15 May 1917 and would serve another two years. When the Royal Munster Fusiliers were transferred to the 48th Brigade, 16th (Irish) Division on 29 January 1918 Gleeson remained with the 1st Infantry Division.|$|E

500|$|Weezer {{received}} generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns {{a rating}} out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73 out of 100. AllMusic senior writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{who gave the}} album a [...] rating of {{four and a half}} stars, stated that [...] "this may seem like nothing special -- it's just punk-pop, delivered without much dynamic range but with a whole lot of hooks -- but nobody else does it this [...] so well, no matter how many bands try." [...] PopMatters' writer Jason Thompson also gave the album a positive review, praising the decision of the band to have Ric Ocasek produce them again: [...] "The guitar solos ring out as joyful as the words. And even the songs' lengths are nice and compact. Weezer comes in, plays the song, and exits. No overkill makes for many moments where you want to hear these songs again and again. Perhaps having producer Ric Ocasek back on board {{was one of the best}} ideas the band had, as the Green Album is certainly water tight all around." [...] Drowned in Sound gave the album a very positive review, saying [...] "After creating the two greatest pop-rock records in existence it's time to add a third. One listen to the Green Album has you eating out of Rivers Cuomo's hand just like in the past. [...] Rivers Cuomo is one of the greatest song-writers that has picked up a guitar. Anyone who can with hold the charms of the Geek-rock quartet are obviously made of stone and complete assholes. <b>Sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> blunt but it's the way it is. God I think the sun's finally taking its toll." [...] The album would later rank at number 3 in their list of the best albums of 2001, tying with System of a Down's Toxicity and Mogwai's Rock Action. Q listed Weezer as one of the best 50 albums of 2001.|$|E
2500|$|In his time, Miller {{was known}} for his {{dishonesty}} and womanizing. His friend and contemporary Ambrose Bierce said of him, [...] "In impugning Mr. Miller's veracity, or rather, in plainly declaring that he has none, I should be <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> understood as attributing a graver moral delinquency than he really has. He cannot, or will not, tell the truth, but he never tells a malicious or thrifty falsehood." ...|$|E
2500|$|His plays {{emphasize}} tragic {{female characters}} (a late {{version of the}} she-tragedy), and contemporary accounts suggest {{that he was an}} extremely friendly and inoffensive individual. [...] He was personally corpulent, and one biographer suggested that he was attacked in The Dunciad simply for being too large a target to avoid. [...] Johnson's remarks in Medea show that he was personally very surprised and <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mentioned in The Dunciad.|$|E

As a result of the breach, the CIE gave Eton's candidates an [...] "assessed mark" [...] for the affected paper instead, a procedure which adjusts their marks for an acceptable reason. In a letter to parents, the college's headmaster said, [...] "I am very <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> writing with this extremely unwelcome news. Regrettably this decision has had to be taken by the examination board because of the actions of a member of Eton’s staff. This is a matter that, as headmaster, I have taken very seriously and Mr Tanweer has now left Eton’s employment." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 4 July 2011, {{he moved}} to Turkish Süper Lig side Samsunspor after seven-year spell in Feyenoord. Following his move to Samsunspor, Andre told Feyenoord's {{official}} website that [...] "he admits he is <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> leaving and says sorely miss this club and this city" [...] He also told Feyenoord's official website that [...] "It {{will take time to}} get used to being Samsunspor after all those years at Feyenoord". Two months after signing for the club due to pre match friendly, Andre made his debut in the Samsunspor shirt in a 3–2 win over Gençlerbirliği on 10 September 2011. At the start of the 2012–13 season, Andre left Samsunspor by mutual consent after one season. His release was explained as Andre sued the club over allegedly owing him four months of unpaid wages.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were also}} various small {{personal}} problems, which irritated and frustrated her. Her office was a small, dark {{room on the}} top floor of the Hotel Cecil next to a men's lavatory, and there was so little furniture that she was forced to keep her papers and files on the floor. In addition she was not given an Air Ministry pass, meaning that every time she entered the building she was forced to fill in a form before being escorted to her office [...] "presumably to call on myself". As a result of these difficulties she officially declined the appointment in a letter to Godfrey Paine on 11 June 1918, saying that [...] "I am very <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> obliged to decline the appointment of Commandant", Despite this she was convinced to stay on, and her appointment was confirmed on 18 June.|$|E

2500|$|This was {{followed}} by a March 1815 review by John Herman Merivale in the Monthly Review, which claimed, [...] "We have no scruple in declaring our opinion that this production will contribute to the advancement of the author's legitimate fame more largely than any of his former poems. Its principal faults are that it is too long by half, too declamatory, and consequently often cold and spiritless where it ought to be most impassioned, and that it is incumbered by a pervading affection of scriptural phraseology". Not everything was a problem: [...] "these defects are counterbalanced by a well chosen subject, happily suited to the prevailing enthusiasm of the author's mind in favour of Spanish liberty, by a deep tone of moral and religious feeling, by an exalted spirit of patriotism, by fine touches of character, by animated descriptions of natural scenery [...] and by an occasional excellence of versification worthy of the best and purest age of English poetry. We are <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> obliged to qualify this praise by repeating that it applies to the work before us only in part".|$|E
2500|$|The July 2011 tournament was Kaiō's 65th as an ōzeki, tying Chiyotaikai's record. On {{the fourth}} day he slapped down Toyonoshima to earn his first victory of the basho and his 1045th in his career. Congratulated by Chiyonofuji {{backstage}} after the bout, Kaiō replied, [...] "I feel <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> compared to someone as great as you." [...] The following day he forced out Kyokutenhō to surpass Chiyonofuji and stand alone in first place. On Day 10, having lost to Kotoōshū to fall to 3–7, Kaiō announced his retirement from sumo, {{just a few days}} short of his 39th birthday, after a discussion with his stablemaster. He remained in sumo as a coach at Tomozuna stable, using the toshiyori or elder name of Asakayama. His retirement left no Japanese at ōzeki or yokozuna {{for the first time since}} January 1993. Speaking at a press conference after his announcement, Kaiō said, [...] "I might not have reached yokozuna or won the championship in front of my home fans in Kyushu but I've had a fulfilling career and have no regrets." [...] His danpatsu-shiki, or official retirement ceremony, took place at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan on 27 May 2012, with around 10000 spectators and hundreds of dignitaries, including his fellow March 1988 entrant Takanohana, taking turns to snip his topknot before it was finally removed by his stablemaster Tomozuna.|$|E
