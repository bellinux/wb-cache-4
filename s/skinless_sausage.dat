5000|$|Ćevapi (...) or ćevapčići (formal diminutive, , [...] ) is {{a grilled}} dish of minced meat, {{a type of}} <b>skinless</b> <b>sausage,</b> found {{traditionally}} in the countries of southeastern Europe (the Balkans). They are considered a national dish in Bosnia and Herzegovina , and are also common in Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania, Slovenia, {{as well as in}} Republic of Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania.|$|E

It is also essential for the fermentation process in the northeastern Thai sausage called sai krok Isan. This latter sausage is made, in contrast to the first two, with a sausage casing.|$|E
5000|$|Cattle farming {{produces}} {{the majority of}} Wales' agricultural output. Welsh beef is protected under European Union law, meaning {{that it must be}} produced and slaughtered in Wales. Welsh pigs are raised, providing good cuts of meat. The mountainous areas of Wales are suited to sheep farming and this has led to an association of their meat with the country. The mutton of Wales has been popular {{in the rest of the}} United Kingdom since the 16th century, and by the end of the 20th century there were more than 11 million sheep in Wales.Several Welsh dishes are thought of because their ingredients are associated with Wales, whereas others have been developed there. Cawl is regarded as the Welsh national dish; it is a slow-cooked meat and vegetable broth. Traditionally it was a vegetable-heavy dish, but now it is more likely to contain beef or lamb. Welsh rarebit is thought to date from the 18th century, although the original term [...] "Welsh rabbit" [...] may have been intended as a slur against the Welsh. Another use of cheese in a traditional Welsh dish is seen in Glamorgan sausage, which is a <b>skinless</b> <b>sausage</b> made of cheese and either leek or spring onion, which is then rolled into a sausage shape before frying. Laverbread is made using a puree of seaweed, and is traditionally served with a Welsh breakfast. Welsh cakes are made on a bakestone, and are small round spiced cakes containing raisins, sultanas and occasionally currants. Bara brith contains similar ingredients to Welsh cakes, but is similar to a tea bread.|$|E

50|$|Debaryomyces hansenii is an osmo-, halo-, xerotolerant, and non-pathogenic yeast {{found in}} hyper-saline waters {{such as the}} salterns on the Atlantic coast of Namibia or in the Great Salt Lake of Utah. D. hansenii is a common species in all types of cheese, {{including}} soft cheeses and the brines of semi-hard and hard cheeses. D. hansenii {{is also the most}} common yeast among 383 isolates from samples of unsulphited or sulphited <b>sausages,</b> <b>skinless</b> <b>sausages</b> and minced beef. The species produces toxins, including mycocins, to destroy competitive yeast species.|$|R
5000|$|In Romania {{the most}} {{commonly}} available street foods during the day are covrigi, hot pretzels covered in sesame or poppy seeds, and plăcinte. [...] "Plăcinte" [...] can refer to sweet or savory pies with various fillings or to large pieces of fried dough eaten with garlic sauce, sour cream, cheese, or jam, similar to Hungarian lángos. In the south and along the Black Sea, plăcintă dobrogeană is available. This type of plăcintă is more like the burek encountered {{in other parts of}} the Balkans. Doughnuts called gogoși are also commonly available. At fairs and in the winter, kürtős kalács (tulnic in Romanian) with nuts or cinnamon is very popular. Mititei or mici, small grilled <b>skinless</b> <b>sausages,</b> are often available in the summer in marketplaces and at fairs. Other street foods include popcorn, steamed ears of corn, roasted chestnuts in winter, and ice cream in summer.|$|R
5000|$|Munster, {{being the}} most {{significant}} dairying region of Ireland, {{was also one of}} the most important areas for pork production as buttermilk made an excellent feed for pigs. Irish pork producers embraced innovation in the course of the late 19th century. In 1862, when a new method of curing bacon was developed it was immediately employed by Irish pork processors. Similar advances were made in breeding. In 1887, the Bacon Curers’ Pig Improvement Association was established and played a central role in popularising the Large White Ulster breed across Munster.In 1820, Henry Denny began business as a provisions merchant in Waterford and, over the following decades, patented a number of production methods of bacon as well as establishing of the Denny ‘star’ brand in Britain., In 1880s, Henry's son Edward established pork processing plants in Germany, Denmark and America with Denny technological expertise in particular helping the Danish bacon industry to develop. Another large Irish pork processor of the era, O'Mara's, meanwhile set up bacon curing facilities in Russia in 1891.The famous Limerick cured ham was also developed around this era. According to a 1902 document from the Department of Agriculture, it came about largely by accident: ‘1880… Limerick producers were short of money…they produced what was considered meat in a half cured condition. The unintentional cure proved extremely popular and others followed suit.’ [...] The decreasing use of salt was additionally supported by advances in technology and transport which meant pork did not need to be stored at ambient temperatures for a long period of time. Recognising the change in tastes that favoured mild cure, Alexander Shaw commented in 1902 that ‘the hard cured bacon of former days would today be looked on as akin to Lot's wife.'One of the by-products of an export-oriented commercial pork industry was the plentiful availability of cheaper cuts to the local populace. In the major Irish production centres such as Limerick, Waterford and particularly Cork, crubeens (pigs totters), drisheen (blood pudding) and tripe were staples of the local diet throughout the 19th and much of the 20th centuries as a result of their plentiful availability.Key brands established in the 19th and early 20th century such as Denny, Galtee, Roscrea and Shaw's remain today among the leading pork, bacon and sausage brands in Ireland. All are owed by Irish food company Kerry Group, which also owns the UK sausage brand Richmond. Richmond Irish sausages Have the largest number of sausages sold by any company in the UK. Denny's sausages receive a mention in James Joyce's Ulysses. 'And a pound and a half of Denny's sausages…The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausage pink' and the company also claims to have invented the <b>skinless</b> <b>sausage</b> in 1941.|$|E
40|$|Canning of sausage {{is one of}} {{the methods}} to extend the shelf life of sausage with lower {{percentage}} of additives such as nitrite. This method reduces transport and storgae costs, too. The present stduy was carried out in two stages. The first stage consists of preparing sausages with four different formulations in Isfahan Senobar Factory and producing canned sausage. In the second stage, physicochemical and organoleptic experiments were carried out. Canned (214409) and bottled (No. 10 - 67) sausages were produced and sterilized in autoclave (absolute pressure= 2 atm) to give F value = 4 min. Cans and jars were filled with <b>skinless</b> <b>sausage</b> of 22 calibre and brine (2 % and 25 oC) at a sausage/brine ratio of 1 : 1. Chemical composition such as moisture, fat and protein were measured according to the standard and AOAC methods. Physical experimets including measurement of texture shear strength were performed in sausage and canned sausage over the 3 -month storage period. Factorial experiments in completely randomized design was used to investigate and analyze statistical data in this study. The Duncan’s multiple range test was used to compare data averages. Moisture content increased and sausgae texture shear strength decreased in all formulations as a result of sterilization. Moisture content increased in four canned sausage formulations while protein and fat decreased (by {{the end of the second}} month of storage). Also, sausage texture shear strength was observed at this time to decrease. In organoleptic evaluations, four canned sausage formulations were not significantly different in flavor, texture, and color (P&lt; 0. 01) ...|$|E
40|$|A Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) {{system was}} {{developed}} for Chinese fish rolls and <b>skinless</b> chicken <b>sausages.</b> The production process of the above products were studied at the processing factory. Microbiological tests were carried out to assess {{the status of the}} products during the production process. The tests were also repeated after taking some corrective measures. The processing stages, namely blending, chilling, battering, crumbing and packing of the final products showed some level of microbial contamination with E. coli, in Chinese fish rolls. In chicken sausages the production line receiving area and equipment workers hands, mincer plates, meat chopper, filled sausages and many other areas showed contamination with E. coli. Staphylococcus aureus contamination was also noted in certain stages but no Salmonella contamination was detected at any stage of processing. Based on the results of monitoring the chilling, battering and crumbing equipment in the production line and during packing was considered important in Chinese fish roll production while in <b>skinless</b> chicken <b>sausage</b> production, cooking, casing and packing were considered for further improvement of quality. The suggested modifications: chilling temperature, thorough cleaning and disinfecting of the production line and hygienic practices of the food handlers in the processing line for Chinese fish rolls and washing the peeling machine with boiling water, providing effective disinfectants for hand washing and cleaning the equipment of the chicken sausage processing line led to drastic reduction of E. coli. and Staphylococcus contamination resulting insvery satisfactory improvement of the quality of products. Use of disinfectants illuminated E. coli. and Stapylococccu from work surfaces...|$|R
500|$|The first {{published}} mention {{of them was}} by George Borrow in his book Wild Wales, written in the 1850s and published in the next decade. He described them as [...] "not a whit inferior to those of Epping"; Epping <b>sausages</b> were <b>skinless</b> meat-based <b>sausages.</b> Borrow visited Y Gwter Fawr (now known as Brynamman); the Tregib Arms has been suggested as the location at which Borrow ate his sausages. Advertisements promoting the sale of Glamorgan sausages in the British Newspaper Archive begin to appear from 1869 onwards, with the first advert placed by pork butcher Henry S. Morgan of 288 Bute Street, Cardiff, placed in the Western Mail on 15 December. Morgan continued to advertise {{over the next several}} years, and by 1874 was claiming that the demand necessitated making the sausages on an hourly basis, and referenced other makers of the sausages making theirs days in advance prior to sale. The advert makes it clear that the sausages were made from [...] "choice dairy-fed pork".|$|R
5000|$|Snacks {{made with}} meat are usually deep fried. This {{includes}} the frikandel (a <b>skinless</b> minced meat <b>sausage),</b> and the kroket (a meat ragout roll covered in breadcrumbs). They {{are available in}} bread rolls - [...] - to take away. A smaller, round version of the kroket, the bitterbal, is often served with mustard as a snack in bars but also at official receptions. Regional snacks include the eierbal (a combination of egg and ragout) {{in the north and}} east of the country, and the slightly spiced Brabants worstenbrood or saucijzenbroodjes, slightly spiced sausage meat baked in pastry (similar to the English sausage roll).|$|R
40|$|<b>Skinless</b> precooked, uncured <b>sausage</b> {{links with}} and without {{potassium}} sorbate (0. 1 % wt/wt) were inoculated with salmonellae, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium botulinum and held at 27 C to represent temperature abuse of the product. Total counts of uninoculated product showed that the normal spoilage flora was delayed 1 day when sorbate was present. Growth of salmonellae was markedly retarded by sorbate. Growth of S. aureus was delayed 1 day {{in the presence of}} sorbate, after which growth occurred to the same level as in product without sorbate. C. perfringens declined to below detectable levels within the first day in product {{with and without}} sorbate. Sorbate retarded the growth of C. botulinum.

5000|$|The Dutch {{have their}} own types of fast food. A Dutch fast food meal often {{consists}} of a portion of french fries (called friet or patat) with a sauce and a meat product. The most common sauce to accompany french fries is fritessaus. It is a sweet, vinegary and low fat mayonnaise substitute, that the Dutch nevertheless still call [...] "mayonnaise". When ordering it is very often abbreviated to met (literally [...] "with"). Other popular sauces are ketchup or spiced ketchup ("curry"), Indonesian style peanut sauce ("satésaus" [...] or [...] "pindasaus") or piccalilli. Sometimes the fries are served with combinations of sauces, most famously speciaal (special): mayonnaise, with (spiced) ketchup and chopped onions; and oorlog (literally [...] "war"): mayonnaise and peanut sauce (sometimes also with ketchup and chopped onions). The meat product is usually a deep fried snack; this includes the frikandel (a deep fried <b>skinless</b> minced meat <b>sausage),</b> and the kroket (deep fried meat ragout covered in breadcrumbs).|$|R
5000|$|It is a long, firm, <b>skinless,</b> dark-coloured meat <b>sausage</b> {{which is}} usually eaten warm. Unlike most sausages, the frikandel is deep-fried. In Belgium and {{in the north of}} France it is called a [...] "frikadel", [...] "fricandelle" [...] or [...] "fricadelle". In some parts of Flanders (Belgium), notably around Antwerp, it is called [...] "curryworst" [...] (not to be {{confused}} with the German Currywurst, though in eastern Germany people tend to eat Currywurst without the skin). In the US it is marketed under the [...] "Dutch Dawg" [...] and [...] "Freakandel" [...] brands. Due to the absence of a skin, one could argue that technically it is not a sausage. Until 2005, the official spelling of the name of this sausage in the Dutch language was without an [...] "n", but both variants are now allowed with frikandel being most commonly used. Although both spelling variants are correct, there is a slight difference today between a frikandel and a frikadel. In Belgium frikadel means (also raw) minced pork; it seldom contains other meat. Where the sausage is called [...] "curryworst", the term frikadel is often used to describe a sort of meatball (the precursor of the frikandel, with the same meat), commonly eaten in Belgium, Germany and Denmark.|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences & IndustryElizabeth A. BoyleQuality {{attributes}} of vacuum packaged, <b>skinless</b> smoked <b>sausage</b> {{made with a}} combination of pork, turkey, and beef, cooked to 64, 68, or 72 °C internal endpoint temperature following USDA FSIS Appendix A, and displayed at 4 °C for up to 120 days under light emitting diode (LED) and fluorescent (FLS) lighting were evaluated. External color, pH, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), proximate analysis, reheat yield, and sensory attributes were measured on day 0, 90, and 120 of display. Purge amount and color were measured on day 10, 90, and 120. Product was displayed in LED or FLS retail display cases set to the same operational and temperature profiles. Lighting type had no effect (P> 0. 05) on any of the measured attributes. Instrumental external color was less (P< 0. 05) red by 0. 63 units in product thermally processed to 64 °C than product processed to 68 °C. Product cooked to 72 °C was less (P< 0. 05) yellow externally compared to those processed to 64 and 68 °C. Purge color lightness increased (P< 0. 05) in product thermally processed to 72 compared to 64 °C. Purge was more red by 0. 36 units (P< 0. 05) on day 120 compared to day 10. Yellowness of purge color increased at 72 °C compared to 64 °C by 0. 66 units. Purge was more yellow (P< 0. 05) on d 120 compared to d 10 and 90. TBARS values decreased (P< 0. 05) from 0. 70 mg of malonaldehyde/ 100 g on day 0 to 0. 35 and 0. 23 on d 90 and 120, respectively. Sensory panel scores showed that flavor intensity decreased (P< 0. 05) as day of storage increased, and saltiness decreased from d 0 to d 90. Purge content increased (P< 0. 05) from 1. 45 % to 1. 90 % in products cooked to 64 and 68 °C, respectively. The amount of purge increased (P< 0. 05) from 1. 58 % to 1. 92 % on day 10 and 90, respectively. While there were slight changes found in quality characteristics of smoked sausages during storage, many of these were minimal. Processors could reduce their internal endpoint temperature following USDA FSIS Appendix A guidelines with minimal effect on product quality. Vacuum packaged pre-cooked smoked sausages could be displayed under LED or FLS lighting with no effect on product quality...|$|R
