40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} the ultrasounds that pursue to find parameters related with physical characteristics of archaeological ceramic materials and {{the evaluation of the}} consolidation materials used in their restoration process. The studied archaeological materials were from the Requena’s archaeological museum at the East of Spain and consist of pieces of different ages, i. e., Bronze, Iberian, Roman and Middle age. Pieces were measured in transmission mode at different ultrasound work frequencies. Due to the shape of the pieces, ultrasounds were applied trying with several coupling methods: gel, immersion and using a rubber adaptor. The recorded ultrasonic signals were processed by time-frequency signal processing techniques in order to derive a signature of the material characteristics. Various signal parameters, such as, wave propagation velocity, dominant frequency, signal power, centroid frequency and signal attenuation, were estimated. Differences for the different materials were found by ultrasound nondestructive testing and some parameters seem to be related with the material porosity. The knowledge of the archaeological material porosity is a key factor to choose the proper <b>consolidation</b> <b>product</b> for restoration. A comparative study of the ultrasonic parameters extracted from the signals measured from pieces after impregnation with different <b>consolidation</b> <b>products</b> is included. 1...|$|R

This paper presents a detailed investigation of user-controlled variables and their influence on drilling resistance. The study proves that the ratio of penetration rate/rotational speed (PR/RPM) is proportional to drilling resistance. Data from Bath stone and an artificial reference stone demonstrates how different materials can be compared using their intrinsic specific energy. It is also shown that adjusting drilling settings does not significantly change drilling measurement variability. However, settings producing high drilling resistance can significantly contribute to drill bit wear. A theoretical framework in which tests can be optimised without compromising the ability to compare data is presented. The framework is of high significance to the conservation industry and will promote a more effective use of DRM. DRM is a minimally invasive procedure particularly appropriate for sensitive heritage structures.

40|$|Surface {{consolidation}} is {{a common}} practice in the conservation of the built heritage. However, the effectiveness of consolidation of calcareous materials is often doubtful, {{due to the lack}} of effective and compatible <b>consolidation</b> <b>products.</b> Dispersions of calcium hydroxide nanoparticles in alcohol, the so-called nanolimes, can recover the superficial consolidation of calcareous substrates. Nevertheless, they are often not able to guarantee an in-depth consolidation. Previous research by the authors has demonstrated that the effectiveness of nanolime can be improved by fine-tuning the properties and the application protocol of the dispersions, based on the moisture transport properties of the material to be treated. In this paper, we verify the consolidation effectiveness and physical compatibility of the developed nanolimes, when applied on coarse porous calcareous materials like Maastricht limestone and lime-based mortars. The results show that a suitable mass consolidation can be achieved with nanolimes, while maintaining a good compatibility with the substrate material. © 2017 Elsevier Lt...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Stone {{consolidation}} {{is almost}} always a very risky intervention. It is a non-reversible intervention and has serious harmful side effects. Due to these shortcomings, a decision {{to go for a}} consolidation action is always difficult to take and it is simple only when it is taken as a “last option ” when replacement or full destruction are the unique alternatives at sight. Stone consolidation is needed because stones decay and loose cohesion in the exposed surfaces down to a certain depth. This conservation operation should take into account that type, extent and rate of decay largely depend on the intrinsic properties of the stone and on the extrinsic or environment factors. The combination of the intrinsic and extrinsic decay factors can give raise to multiple degradation forms that largely influence the decision on to consolidate and the options on the type of consolidant and on its application forms. The identification and characterisation of decay profiles is also a relevant step in stone conservation, namely when consolidation is concerned. The paper gives a brief introduction to a few topics on stone consolidation exemplifying with some current stone <b>consolidation</b> <b>products.</b> It quotes some cases of stone consolidation in recent Portuguese experience and presents some illustrations {{on the use of the}} microdrilling instrument in the detection of past consolidation actions. 1...|$|R

Inorganic consolidants are usually preferred to organic ones due to better compatibility and durability. The aim of this work is the experimental characterization of two nanostructured consolidant products; a commercial nanolime, optimized {{with the addition of a}} reduced concentration of ethyl silicate, and a commercial nanosilica product underwent experiments to verify their consolidation efficiency. Nanostructured lime-based and silica-based products present interesting properties such as homogeneous distribution and high stability. Nanolimes were applied in combined applications with ethyl silicate, a well-known compatible <b>product</b> for <b>consolidation</b> intervention. The combined application guarantees some benefits and improves the mechanical and microstructural performance of these products. A nanosilica product was tested to better understand some known disadvantages (e. g. reduced penetration depth) and so its performances. Consolidant products were applied on weak lime mortar samples (prismatic samples and single mortar layer applied on bricks); these mortars were optimized by studying different binder-aggregate ratios, to simulate old lime mortar with cohesion loss.

40|$|Consolidation of {{degraded}} {{and frail}} wood by impregnation with synthetic and natural polymeric compounds in solution {{is one of}} the most important operations of active conservation of wooden cultural heritage. The effectiveness of such a treatment depends essentially on the consolidant retention, penetration and uniformity of distribution, aspects that could be cumulated in the term of impregnation level and practically influenced by many and various factors. The purpose of this work was to look at some practical possibilities of characterising the impregnation level achieved in some consolidation treatments with different solutions of a frequently employed synthetic polymer (Paraloid B 72) and waxes (beeswax and modified paraffins as melts or in combination with linseed oil) using a simple optical microscopy technique in conjunction with an original method of samples preparation. For this purpose were used small samples of sound, not degraded spruce (Picea abies Mill), which were impregnated by short time immersion. The examination in transmitted light (TLM) of the cross-cut micro sections and in reflected light (RLM) of the wooden blocks allowed the visualisation of the <b>consolidation</b> <b>products</b> and their distribution in the wood structure, but this was easier for the consolidants with high solids content (waxes), which partly filled the lumens, and much more difficult and relative in the case of the diluted Paraloid solutions which did not fill the lumens but only impart a very shiny, highly reflective aspect of the treated areas. In order to objectively appreciate the retention and penetration of consolidants into wood the method using ImageJ, a useful image processing software, was used to process the micrographs so that some quantitative estimations of the variation of the impregnation level with the penetration depth were obtained...|$|R

30|$|Cross-docking is a {{distribution}} strategy {{that enables the}} <b>consolidation</b> of <b>products</b> from origins to destinations. In a cross-dock, products are unloaded from inbound trucks and directly reloaded to outbound trucks without long storage in it. It is proved that the cross-docking in compare with traditional distribution centers dealing with cost and storage reduction, has shorter delivery lead time, better customer servicing, fast inventory turn and less loss and damage risks (Apte and Viswanathan 2000). Implementation of the cross-docking can decrease warehousing costs up to 70 % (Vahdani and Zandieh 2010) and decreases transportation costs by using full trucks and consolidating shipments (Apte and Viswanathan 2000). The most important constraint in the cross-docking is the limited time for products storage inside the cross-dock (e.g., 24  h) (Schaffer 1998). In some cases like frozen products or some kinds of drugs, the storage time might be even less than an hour. Because of this characteristic, vehicle routing and scheduling of inbound and outbound trucks play important role in applying a cross-docking system (Lee et al. 2006).|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} numerical {{and analytical}} {{investigation of the}} geomechanics underlying longwall mining. It was tried out to study the disturbances induced by longwall mining in nearby rocks and their influence on {{the stability of the}} gates, pillars and main tunnels of longwall mines. The thesis consists of two major parts: numerical and analytical investigations. The study site is the Svea Nord coalmine, Svalbard, Norway. A novel algorithm was proposed for numerical simulation of the longwall mining process. In the proposed algorithm progressive cave-in and fracturing of the roof <b>strata,</b> <b>consolidation</b> of the cave-in materials and stress changes are simulated in detail. In order to outline the caved-in roof rocks a criterion based on maximum principal strain (in tension) was used. The critical tensile strain of roof cave-in was determined through back-calculation of the surface subsidence above a longwall panel at the mine. The results of the simulations were then used to analyse stress changes induced by longwall mining and the stability of gates. The simulations revealed that the stability of the gates and the loading to the rock bolts are closely related to the width of the chain pillars. With slender pillars, shear displacements along weak interlayers and bedding planes result in heavy loading to the rock bolts. Therefore, the locations of weakness zones should be taken into account in rock bolt design. The developed algorithm was implemented to study the loading and stability of the barrier pillar of the mine. The barrier pillars protect the main tunnels and border area of the mine from disturbances induced by longwall mining in the panels. The simulations show that the stresses in the barrier pillars fluctuate up and down during mining because of periodic cave-in events behind the longwall face. A failure zone of about 12 m exists in the wall of the barrier pillars. A large portion of the barrier pillar is still intact and is, thus, capable of protecting the border area. The results of the detailed simulations of longwall mining via the developed algorithm were, also, implemented in a large-scale numerical model. The model consists of all of the longwall panels and the border area of the mine. It is intended that the coal in the border area {{on the other side of}} the longwall panels will be mined after completion of the longwall mining. There is concern about how the longwall mining affects the stress state in the border area and how stress changes would affect future mining in the border area. A failure zone of about 20 m developed in the wall of the main tunnels on the side of the border area after all the longwall panels were mined out. The stress state in the remaining portion of the border area remains unchanged. Therefore, it will be possible to mine the border area in the future. In order to investigate the roof strata cave-in mechanism in detail a discontinuous numerical simulation of roof cave-in process was conducted by UDEC code. The block size in the roof strata and the mechanical parameters of the discontinuities were obtained through back-calculations. The back-calculations were conducted with a statistical method, Design of Experiment (DOE). Numerical simulations revealed that jointed voussoir beams formed in the roof strata before the first cave-in. Beam bending results in stress fluctuations in the roof strata. The maximum deflection of a roof stratum at the study site before the first cave-in is about 70 % of the stratum thickness. The simulations and field measurements show no periodic weighting on the longwall shields in this mine. Numerical sensitivity analyses show, however, that periodic weighting may occur in strong roof strata. Roof strata with a high Young’s modulus and large joint spacing are not suitable for longwall mining. The maximum sustainable deflection of the roof strata before cave-in depends upon the horizontal in-situ stress state. It slightly increases with the in-situ horizontal stress in the stratum beams, but the horizontal stress would increase the possibility of rock-crushing in deflected roof beams. The implemented numerical method would be useful in assessment of the cavability of the roof strata and in selection of longwall shields with adequate load capacity. As shown through discontinuous numerical simulations, the roof strata above the underground opening constructed in the stratified rocks form voussoir beams. The stability of those beams is the major concern in the study of the gate stability and roof cave-in assessment in the longwall panels. Two different analytical methods were developed for cases with and without the in-situ horizontal stress acting along the beams. In the analytical model for the beams without horizontal stress a bilinear shape was assumed for the compression arch generated within the voussoir beams. The stability of the compression arch is governed by the energy method. The model requires an iterative procedure for convergence, and an algorithm was proposed for it. The analytical method was verified with numerical simulations by means of a discrete element code, UDEC. For the beams subjected to in-situ horizontal stress, the classic beam theory was employed to drive the analytical solution for it. The superposition method was used to obtain bending/deflection equations of the beam. The validity of both the assumptions and the developed method were, also, investigated by numerical simulations. The developed analytical method revealed that high Young’s modulus of a beam rock increases the stability of the beams against buckling but it causes higher stress within the compression arch which increases the probability of crushing failures in the beam abutments and midspan. In-situ horizontal stress along beams increases their stability against buckling and abutment sliding failure, but it raises the possibility of crushing failure at the abutments and the midspan.

In this paper, {{we examine}} the effect of product variety on {{inventory}} costs in a production– inventory system with finite capacity where products are made to stock and share the same manufacturing facility. The facility incurs a setup time whenever it switches from producing one product type to another. The production facility has a finite production rate and stochastic production times. In order to mitigate the effect of setups, products are produced in batches. In contrast to inventory systems with exogenous lead times, we show that inventory costs increase almost linearly in the number of products. More importantly, we show that the rate of increase is sensitive to system parameters including demand and process variability, demand and capacity levels, and setup times. The effect of these parameters can be counterintuitive. For example, we show that the relative increase in cost due to higher product variety is decreasing in demand and process variability. We also show that it is decreasing in expected production time. On the other hand, we find that the relative cost is increasing in expected setup time, setup time variability and aggregate demand rate. Furthermore, we show that the effect of product variety on optimal base stock levels is not monotonic. We use the model to draw several managerial insights regarding the value of variety-reducing strategies such as <b>product</b> <b>consolidation</b> and delayed differentiation...|$|R
