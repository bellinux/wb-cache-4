2500|$|Breaking a superencrypted cipher like JN-25 was a three-step process: (a) {{determining}} the [...] "indicator" [...] method {{to establish the}} starting point within the additive cipher, (b) stripping away the <b>superencryption</b> to expose the bare code, and then (c) breaking the code itself. When JN-25 was first detected and recognized, such intercepted messages as were interceptable were collected (at assorted intercept stations around the Pacific by the Navy) {{in an attempt to}} accumulate sufficient depth to attempt to strip away the <b>superencryption.</b> Success at doing so was termed by the cryptographers a 'break' into the system. Such a break did not always produce a cleartext version of the intercepted message; only a break in third phase could do so. Only after breaking the underlying code (another difficult process) would the message be available, and even then its meaning—in an intelligence sense—might be less than fully clear.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{encryption}} is {{the process}} of encrypting an already encrypted message one or more times, either using the same or a different algorithm. It is also known as cascade encryption, cascade ciphering, multiple encryption, and superencipherment. <b>Superencryption</b> refers to the outer-level encryption of a multiple encryption.|$|E

50|$|BATCO, {{short for}} Battle Code, is a hand-held, paper-based {{encryption}} system used at a low, front line (platoon, troop and section) {{level in the}} British Army. It was introduced along with the Clansman combat net radio in the early 1980s and was largely obsolete by 2010 due to the wide deployment of the secure Bowman radios. BATCO consists of a code, contained {{on a set of}} vocabulary cards, and cipher sheets for <b>superencryption</b> of the numeric code words. The cipher sheets, which are typically changed daily, also include an authentication table and a radio call sign protection system.|$|E
50|$|The next {{development}} was the paper pad system. Diplomats had long used codes and ciphers for confidentiality and to minimize telegraph costs. For the codes, {{words and phrases}} were converted to groups of numbers (typically 4 or 5 digits) using a dictionary-like codebook. For added security, secret numbers could be combined with (usually modular addition) each code group before transmission, with the secret numbers being changed periodically (this was called <b>superencryption).</b> In the early 1920s, three German cryptographers (Werner Kunze, Rudolf Schauffler and Erich Langlotz), {{who were involved in}} breaking such systems, realized that they could never be broken if a separate randomly chosen additive number was used for every code group. They had duplicate paper pads printed with lines of random number groups. Each page had a serial number and eight lines. Each line had six 5-digit numbers. A page would be used as a work sheet to encode a message and then destroyed. The serial number of the page would be sent with the encoded message. The recipient would reverse the procedure and then destroy his copy of the page. The German foreign office put this system into operation by 1923.|$|E
