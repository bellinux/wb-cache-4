40|$|AbstractThe molting during Drosophila {{development}} is tightly {{regulated by the}} ecdysone hormone. Several steps of the ecdysone biosynthesis have been already identified but the regulation of the entire process has not been clarified yet. We have previously reported that dATAC histone acetyltransferase complex {{is necessary for the}} <b>steroid</b> hormone <b>biosynthesis</b> process. To reveal possible mechanisms controlled by dATAC we made assumptions that either dATAC may influence directly the transcription of Halloween genes involved in <b>steroid</b> hormone <b>biosynthesis</b> or it may exert an indirect effect on it by acetylating the Ftz-F 1 transcription factor which regulates the transcription of steroid converting genes. Here we show that the lack of dATAC complex results in increased mRNA level and decreased protein level of Ftz-F 1. In this context, decreased mRNA and increased protein levels of Ftz-F 1 were detected upon treatment of Drosophila S 2 cells with histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. We showed that Ftz-F 1, the transcriptional activator of Halloween genes, is acetylated in S 2 cells. In addition, we found that ecdysone biosynthetic Halloween genes are transcribed in S 2 cells and their expression can be influenced by deacetylase inhibitors. Furthermore, we could detect H 4 K 5 acetylation at the regulatory regions of disembodied and shade Halloween genes, while H 3 K 9 acetylation is absent on these genes. Based on our findings we conclude that the dATAC HAT complex might play a dual regulatory role in Drosophila <b>steroid</b> hormone <b>biosynthesis</b> through the acetylation of Ftz-F 1 protein and the regulation of the H 4 K 5 acetylation at the promoters of Halloween genes...|$|R
2500|$|The {{synthesis}} of adrenocortical steroid hormones involves {{a chain of}} oxidation-reduction reactions catalyzed {{by a series of}} enzymes. Synthesis begins with a molecule of cholesterol. Through shared intermediates and pathways branching off those shared intermediates, the different classes of steroids are synthesized. Steroids are synthesized from cholesterol in their respective regions of the adrenal cortex. The process is controlled by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) which sits in the mitochondrial membrane and regulates the passage of cholesterol. [...] This is the rate-limiting step of <b>steroid</b> <b>biosynthesis.</b> Once StAR has transported cholesterol into the mitochondria, the cholesterol molecule undergoes a string of oxidation-reduction reactions catalyzed by a series of enzymes from the family of cytochrome P450 enzymes. A coenzyme system called adrenodoxin reductase transfers electrons to the P450 enzyme which initiates the oxidation-reduction reactions that transform cholesterol into the steroid hormones. Though synthesis is initiated inside mitochondria, precursors are shuttled to the endoplasmic reticulum for processing by enzymes present in the endoplasmic reticulum. The precursors are shuttled back to the mitochondria in the region of the adrenal cortex within which synthesis initially began and it is there that synthesis is completed.|$|E

Methods. A rat model of CFS was established using restraint-stress, forced exercise, and crowded and noisy environments over a period of 4 weeks.

Urine metabolites were analyzed via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in combination with multivariate statistical analysis before and after exercise. Results.

Methods Eleven children were recruited in the study. Concentrations of steroids in blood samples were determined using high sensitivity liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry methods. Symptoms were assessed with a clinical rating scale developed for the study. Steroid concentrations were measured at the entry into study and after recovery; and concentrations were evaluated for the association with the symptoms in apathetic children.

Ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis showed that the fourth-generation progestins, nestorone (NES), nomegestrol acetate (NoMAC) and drospirenone (DRSP), unlike the progestins selected from the first three generations, modulate the biosynthesis of several endogenous steroids.
