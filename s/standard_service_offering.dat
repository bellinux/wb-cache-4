50|$|Plain old {{telephone}} service (POTS) is a retronym for voice-grade {{telephone service}} employing analog signal transmission over copper loops. POTS was the <b>standard</b> <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> from telephone companies from 1876 until 1988 when the now-obsolete Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Basic Rate Interface (BRI) was introduced, followed by cellular telephone systems, and Voice over IP (VoIP). POTS remains the basic form of residential {{and small business}} service connection to the telephone network {{in many parts of}} the world. The term reflects the technology that has been available since the introduction of the public telephone system in the late 19th century, in a form mostly unchanged despite the introduction of Touch-Tone dialing, electronic telephone exchanges and fiber-optic communication into the public switched telephone network (PSTN).|$|E
5000|$|A {{value-added}} service (VAS) {{is a popular}} telecommunications industry term for non-core services, or, in short, all services beyond standard voice calls and fax transmissions. However, {{it can be used}} in any service industry, for services available at little or no cost, to promote their primary business. In the telecommunications industry, on a conceptual level, {{value-added service}}s add value to the <b>standard</b> <b>service</b> <b>offering,</b> [...] subscribers to use their phone more and allowing the operator to drive up their ARPU. For mobile phones, technologies like SMS, MMS and data access were historically usually considered value-added services, but in recent years SMS, MMS and data access have more and more become core services, and VAS therefore has begun to exclude those services.|$|E

5000|$|Cable TV is {{very cheap}} for all standards, the <b>standard</b> or basic <b>service,</b> <b>offering</b> about 50 channels, is around 20-30 RON/month {{including}} VAT (about 5-7 €), {{with the most}} expensive <b>service,</b> <b>offering</b> 10-15 channels more, including some pay-per-view such as HBO or Cinemax, costing no more than 60-70 RON/month (around 14-17 €). Cable television is also attractive because today, all CATV operators in Romania are also providing Internet access at various speeds (ranging from 20 MBPS to 1000 MBPS - depending on the provider and region), in many cases subscribers are contracting an Internet and TV package, at a fairly low price (as low as 50 lei/month or even less for [...] "NET and CATV" [...] for a basic package - depending on the provider). Internet access is, in many cases, granted by cable TV operators, as it was cheaper to implement it over the existent CATV networks in some cases.|$|R

A significant body of published research in the WiMAX domain exists, but the focus of much of it is on the use of analytic or simulation models to evaluate aspects of physical layer protocols, medium access control protocols, or proposed scheduling algorithms. It this paper we describe performance characteristics of an operational WiMAX testbed upon which we were able to conduct controlled experiments in the absence of competing traffic. We characterize latency, throughput, protocol overhead, packet loss, and the impact of WiMAX on TCP dynamics. Index Terms—WiMAX, IEEE 802. 16, wireless, performance...|$|R

Our Web <b>Service</b> <b>Offerings</b> Language (WSOL) enables formal specification of important management information [...] classes of service (modeled as <b>service</b> <b>offerings),</b> various types of constraint (functional, QoS, access rights), and management statements (e. g., prices, penalties, and management responsibilities) [...] for XML Web Services.

To support monitoring of WSOL <b>service</b> <b>offerings,</b> we have extended the Apache Axis open-source SOAP engine with WSOI-specific modules, data structures, and management ports. To support dynamic manipulation of WSOL <b>service</b> <b>offerings,</b> we have developed appropriate algorithms, protocols, and management port types and built into WSOI modules and data structures for their implementation.

40|$|Background: The {{selection}} of transport operators {{has become a}} complex decision making process with multi-criteria aspects. Deciding on which transport operator to use depends on various <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> that can be different for each company. Retailers such as those from France, the Netherlands, Sweden and UK look to improve logistical performance {{in areas such as}} lead time, flexibility and reliability, and improve customer relations. In the past the main critical aspects of retailers were cost and service optimisation. An additional factor could play a role in their {{selection of}} transport operators and this is green <b>service</b> <b>offerings.</b>   Research question: Which <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are important for French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers in their selection of transport operators? Sub question 1 : Are the retailers willing to use green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> and why? Sub question 2 : Which of the green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are important for French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers in their selection of transport operators?   Purpose: The {{purpose of this paper is}} to find out what the most important <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are for French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers in their selection of transport operators. It also aims to determine if French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers are willing to use green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> and explain why. Finally, it will attempt to identify which of the green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are important for French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers in their selection of transport operators.   Method: This thesis was conducted by applying the deductive approach and is based on a quantitative research method. The sampling method used for this thesis is non-probability sampling. Data was collected through questionnaires with French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers. French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers have been selected for the sample population in order to find out how important green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> might be for them when they are purchasing the services of a transport operator. French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers from different sectors were chosen in order to achieve an objective overview of the retail industry from each country when selecting transport operators.         Conclusion: Traditional <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are more important than green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> for French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers that participated in this research paper. However, when looking at the results of the data, some green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> were perceived to be important. The authors therefore believe that when French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers are selecting transport operators their first focus is on the traditional <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> that are very important to them. However, if a French, Dutch, Swedish or UK retailer is encouraged by the following motivators: customer expectations, measurable improvement or economic incentives. They might pursue the green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> that are important for their business activities...|$|R

40|$|Our {{research}} on Web Services is organized into two related projects. First, we develop Web <b>Service</b> <b>Offerings</b> Language (WSOL) for formal specification of various constraints and classes of service for Web <b>Services.</b> A <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> in WSOL is a formal representation of one {{class of service}} of one Web Service. It contains formal representation of various constraints: functional (pre-, post-, and future -conditions), non-functional (a. k. a. Quality of Service - QoS), and access rights. It also contains statements about price/penalty and management responsibility. The Web Service, its consumer, or one or more designated third parties (usually SOAP message intermediaries) can evaluate WSOL constraints. For easier specification of similar <b>service</b> <b>offerings,</b> WSOL enables specification of constraint groups (CGs) and constraint group templates (CGTs). We have also developed a format for representation of dynamic relationships between <b>service</b> <b>offerings.</b> WSOL <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are simple contracts and SLAs (Service Level Agreements) between Web Services...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. WSOL (Web <b>Service</b> <b>Offerings</b> Language) is an XML (Extensible Markup Language) {{notation}} {{compatible with}} the WSDL (Web <b>Services</b> De-scription Language) <b>standard.</b> While WSDL is used for describing operations provided by Web Services, WSOL enables formal specification of multiple classes of service for one Web <b>Service.</b> A <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> is a formal represen-tation of one class of service for a Web Service. As classes of service for Web Services are determined by combinations of various constraints, WSOL enables formal specification of functional constraints, some QoS (a. k. a., non-functional) constraints, simple access rights (for differentiation of service), price, and rela-tionships with other <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> of the same Web Service. Describing a Web Service in WSOL, in addition to WSDL, enables selection of a more ap-propriate Web <b>Service</b> and <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> for particular circumstances. Fur-ther, it supports dynamic adaptation and management of Web Service composi-tions using manipulation of <b>service</b> <b>offerings.</b> ...|$|R

Gender differences were also explored in both perceived value and loyalty. The study built on a review of existing literature in order to establish the constructs explored and develop the research structure and focus. A consumer study was conducted in the Singapore market and responses collected from 120 respondents to explore respondents’ value perception of the <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> and their attitudinal loyalty. Gender differences were observed in both perceived value and loyalty, with females valuing the <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> more than the males, and also indicating higher attitudinal loyalty toward the <b>service</b> <b>offering.</b> It was found that consumers who have experienced the <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> indicated higher attitudinal loyalty, establishing that the <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> contributes to increased consumer loyalty. It was also established that perceived value predicts loyalty, indicating that where value is perceived in the offering, consumers were more loyal. Limitations in the study restrict the generalization of the results across different markets. A more balanced age group distribution should ideally be conducted in a further study. The remaining dimensions of perceived value and loyalty should also be studied in future research to establish a more comprehensive measure of value and loyalty...|$|R
