40|$|Abstract. Linearity {{is a very}} {{important}} parameter for seamless steel pipes. A real-time and on-line visual measurement system for <b>seamless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> linearity is presented. The system consists of several structured-light visual sensors. Each sensor can achieve the coordinate of the center of partial steel pipe in its local coordinate system. Through global calibration, all coordinates measured can be transformed into an integrated coordinate system. The linearity error of steel pipe can be assessed. This method can fulfill 100 % on-line and real-time linearity measurement. A pair structure-light sensor is designed to improve accuracy and a suspension-wires method for sensor calibration and global calibration is used. Through experiments, it shows that the method not only meets the need of precise calibration but also significantly improves the efficiency and feasibility...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents the}} influence of manufacturing processes and heat treatments on the resulting microstructures and mechanical properties of an API 5 L PSL 2 <b>seamless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>pipe.</b> Three different conditions are considered - as rolled, normalized and quenched and tempered - to obtain the grades X 42 R, X 42 N and X 70 Q, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy techniques was used to characterize the resultant microstructures. Tensile, hardness, impact, fracture toughness (J integral) and fatigue crack growth tests (da/dN x &# 916;K) were used to study the materials mechanical behavior. The results show the possibility of achieving API grades for a seamless pipeline steel, through suitable heat treatments.

40|$|The Vallourec {{group is}} the world leader in <b>seamless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> {{manufacture}} for {{the oil and gas}} and energy sectors and for other industrial applications. With increasingly demanding customers and international standards, a number of quality inspections need to be implemented during production. One of these is ultrasonic testing, for which various technologies have been developed to make this inspection the most robust and the most reliable means of characterizing imperfections. One of the main limitations of these technologies is the lack of knowledge of the tensile properties of the materials and their variability from one part to another. These materials are considered to be isotropic although they can be slightly anisotropic. These anomalies may be connected to the various manufacturing processes (steel – product). The influence of the anisotropy of the materials inspected was therefore analyzed in order to estimate the precision of the algorithms defining the position and dimensions of the imperfections detected. For this, five samples of potentially anisotropic materials were tested in order to analyse their degree of anisotropy and their behaviour when interacting with an ultrasonic beam. This behaviour was analysed by means of an ultrasonic simulation model developed for this purpose. Key words: Anisotropy, ultrasonic non-destructive testing, flaw dimensions and position, ultrasonic simulation...|$|E

40|$|The {{detection}} {{and location of}} hydrogen induced cracks In steel pipes is unreliable and time consuming because of the unpredictable nature of the defect {{and the lack of}} sensitivity of conventional non destructive testing techniques. Determination of the susceptibility of steels to the formation of hydrogen induced cracking by attack from a sour gas environment has always been based on laboratory testing of small samples where the samples are subjected to attack from all sides. This is unrealistic compared to the in-service situation and a single sided exposure test is more realistic. In this thesis the subject literature is reviewed. Experiments on small samples show that seamless steel is the least susceptible to hydrogen induced cracking, whereas electric welded un directionally formed pipe is the most susceptible. The susceptibility of submerged arc welded pipe depends on the metallurgical form of the pipe but is always less susceptible than the electric welded pipe. Ultrasonic techniques have been used to detect the location of hydrogen induced cracks but manual techniques are labour intensive and unreliable. Four complete pipes were subjected to a sour gas environment from one side, one of which was seamless and one electric welded. These pipes were monitored using a passive non destructive testing technique, acoustic emission. A mechanised ultrasonic scanner was used to examine the last two pipes found to be susceptible to cracking using a specially selected ultrasonic transducer. The acoustic emission data collected was used to detect and locate areas of high acoustic activity produced by the formation of hydrogen Induced cracking. These areas were examined metallographically and shown to include several forms of hydrogen induced cracking. The mechanised ultrasonic technique failed to detect near surface (< 1 mm) cracks, but was able to resolve mid wall affected areas. The <b>seamless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> was unaffected, whereas the electric welded pipe was severely affected by the sour gas environment. The automatic welded pipes suffered varying degrees of attack. This supports laboratory based experiments on small samples reported previously by other workers...|$|E

40|$|Experiments and {{numerical}} simulations {{were conducted}} to investigate the dynamic response in a pipe-on-pipe impact event, in which a missile (swinging) pipe with one end hinged and the other end free impinges on an orthogonal simply-supported/clamped target pipe at its centre. This study focuses {{on the effects of}} the impact location on the missile pipe and the wall thickness of the pipes. The experiments were carried out by using a spring-powered catapult impact setup, the specimens used were made of <b>seamless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>pipes</b> of two different thicknesses, 1 mm and 3 mm respectively, and the target pipes were clamped. Seven tests were carried out using the catapult. Numerical simulations using the explicit finite element code LS-DYNA were performed on an HPC 360 workstation for each of the seven test cases. The results of the experiments and numerical simulations were compared, showing good agreement. Having confirmed the validity of the numerical model, numerical simulations were applied to the cases of a simply-supported target pipe, and the partitioning of the energy dissipation was calculated. As the response mode depends significantly on the initial impact position, the evolution of the response mode was examined numerically as the point of impact on the missile pipe was moved from the hinged end to the free end. it was found that there is a particular impact location for which the target pipe was most seriously damaged using the same impact speed.

40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of economical construction of infrastructures has recently increased.
