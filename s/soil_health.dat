25|$|The Government of Gujarat, {{to improve}} soil {{management}} and introduce farmers to new technology, {{started on a}} project which involved giving every farmer a <b>Soil</b> <b>Health</b> Card. This acts like a ration card, providing permanent identification for the status of cultivated land, as well as farmers' names, account numbers, survey numbers, soil fertility status and general fertiliser dose. Samples of land from each village are taken and analysed by the Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertiliser Corporation, State Fertiliser Corporation and Indian Farmers Fertilisers Co-operative. 1,200,000 soil test data from the villages was collected as of 2008, from farmer's field villages have gone into a database. Assistance and advice for this project was given by local agricultural universities and crop and soil-specific data {{was added to the}} database. This allows the soil test data to be interpreted and recommendations or adjustments made in terms of fertiliser requirements, which are also added to the database.|$|E

25|$|Crops do not end {{up using}} all of the {{synthetic}} fertilizer it is fed. The remainder ends up polluting surrounding land. Some of it will evaporate into the air where it will acidify the rain and produce greenhouse gases. It will also seep into the groundwater or run off into nearby bodies of water, thus polluting the drinking water of nearby communities. Poor <b>soil</b> <b>health</b> resulting from overproduction, excessive fertilizer use and inappropriate application of fertilizer causes runoff and leaching. Runoff into forests or marine areas can alter the ecosystem by fertilizing some plan species and poisoning others. The result of toxic runoff from commodity agriculture surrounding the Mississippi River {{can be seen at}} the hypoxic zone where the river meets the Gulf of Mexico. Here, algae grow rampant as a result of nitrogen fertilizer runoff thereby suffocating the animal life. This area has not reduced in size despite previous action plans for reduction made by the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force. This hypoxic zone threatens the $2.8 billion fishing industry that depends on {{the northern part of the}} Gulf, which could affect the economy at large.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the growth}} in {{biological}} farming practices becoming more common throughout the Australia, traditional synthetic based fertilisers are replaced {{by the use of}} organic fertilisers in the form of compost and soil conditioners. Compost can improve overall <b>soil</b> <b>health</b> when incorporated into the soil or surface-applied as a soil conditioner. Despite differing in nutrient requirements, crops such as wheat, barley, oats, maize, canola, lucerne, fruit trees, grapes, sugar cane and much more can all benefit from the addition of pasteurised and composted organic materials. Compost can improve the soil’s physical, biological and chemical properties and positively enhance actively growing crops. Australian farmers are leading the way in the [...] of organic materials both above and below the soil surface. This continued used of composted organics completes the law of return cycle in the soil food chain, where nutrients removed through the plants, are returned to the soil.|$|E
2500|$|The Great Depression of 1873, and {{subsequent}} farming depressions, {{and most importantly}} the growth of Egyptian cotton and Indian cotton pushed aside American cotton, which had previously provided the prosperity of the planter class. Although this decreased the demand and forced a change to crops such as corn, and wheat thereby restoring <b>soil</b> <b>health,</b> the new crops did not bring in enough wealth or traffic to the growers, merchant class, and railroad. [...] Still, the growers experimented with multi-crop rotation, schemes at sharecropping and tenant farming, and eventually earned valuable income from tobacco in later decades. [...] The number of plantations never recovered, yet, ironically several of the sharecroppers and tenant farmers managed to evolve into a yeoman farmers. However, the setbacks in economic markets and demand, domestic and foreign competition, all combined to keep the narrow gauge railroad from generating sufficient traffic and rebuilding the antebellum prosperity. [...] Ironically, it did succeed in returning the area to its 17th-century period of mixed economy, thereby allowing the continued survival and slow economic growth of the region.|$|E

40|$|The {{idea that}} human health {{is tied to}} the soil is not a new one. As far back as circa 1400 BC the Bible depicts Moses as {{understanding}} that fertile soil was essential to the well-being of his people. In 400 BC the Greek philosopher Hippocrates provided a list of things that should be considered in a proper medical evaluation, including the properties of the local ground. By the late 1700 s and early 1800 s, American farmers had recognized that soil properties had some connection to human health. In the modern world, we recognize that soils have a distinct influence on human health. We recognize that soils influence (1) food availability and quality (food security), (2) human contact with various chemicals, and (3) human contact with various pathogens. <b>Soils</b> and human <b>health</b> studies include investigations into nutrient supply through the food chain and routes of exposure to chemicals and pathogens. However, making strong, scientific connections between <b>soils</b> and human <b>health</b> can be difficult. There are multiple variables to consider in the soil environment, meaning traditional scientific studies that seek to isolate and manipulate a single variable often do not provide meaningful data. The complete study of <b>soils</b> and human <b>health</b> also involves many different specialties such as soil scientists, toxicologists, medical professionals, anthropologists, etc. These groups do not traditionally work together on research projects, and do not always effectively communicate with one another. Climate change and how it will affect the soil environment/ecosystem going into the future is another variable affecting the relationship between <b>soils</b> and <b>health.</b> Future successes in <b>soils</b> and human <b>health</b> research will require effectively addressing difficult issues such as these...|$|R

40|$|Direct {{effects of}} soil or its {{constituents}} {{on human health}} are through its ingestion, inhalation or absorption. The soil contains many infectious organisms that may enter the human body through these pathways, but it also provides organisms on which our earliest antibiotics are based. Indirect effects of soil arise from {{the quantity and quality}} of food that humans consume. Trace elements can have both beneficial and toxic effects on humans, especially where the range for optimal intake is narrow. We focus on four trace elements (iodine, iron, selenium and zinc) whose deficiencies have substantial effects on human health. As the world’s population increases issues of food security become more pressing, as does the need to sustain soil fertility and minimize its degradation. Lack of adequate food and food of poor nutritional quality lead to differing degrees of under-nutrition, which in turn causes ill <b>health.</b> <b>Soil</b> and land are finite resources and agricultural land is under severe competition from other uses.
