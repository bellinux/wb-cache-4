40|$|Gallium {{scintigraphy}} {{was used}} to evaluate therapeutic response in a 10 -year-old, male, Dutch sheepdog, suffering from an oral melanoma. Treatment was performed with a combination of carboplatin and hypofractionated radiation. Nineteen weeks after radiation therapy, the left <b>submandibular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was surgically removed because of metastatic disease. Thirty weeks after radiation therapy, (67) Gallium scintigraphy was performed to assess for residual disease and metastasis.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Melioidosis, endemic in Thailand {{and in the}} Northern Territory of Australia is an {{emerging}} infectious disease in India which can present with varied forms. A case of melioidosis, presenting as a rare anterior mediastinal mass which can masquerade as malignancy or tuberculosis, is described here. With treatment, our patient initially showed {{an increase in the}} size of mediastinal node and development of new submandibular node [...] To the best of our knowledge, this phenomenon has not been documented in the literature and the same is highlighted in this case report. Case Presentation A 43 -year-old Asian man with diabetes presented with fever, loss of appetite, weight loss for one month and painful swelling below his left mandible for five days. An examination revealed an enlarged left <b>submandibular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and bilateral axillary lymph nodes. A chest X-ray showed mediastinal widening. Computed tomography of his thorax showed a lobulated heterogeneously enhancing anterior mediastinal mass encasing the superior vena cava suggestive of malignancy. An excision biopsy of the lymph node showed granulomas suggestive of tuberculosis but bone marrow culture and lymph node aspirate culture grew Burkholderia pseudomallei. He was treated with parenteral ceftazidime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. During the course of treatment, he developed an enlargement of the <b>submandibular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> on the opposite side. It gradually subsided with the continuation of therapy orally with a combination of cotrimoxazole and doxycycline for six months. A repeat computed tomography chest scan showed resolution of the mediastinal mass. Conclusion Melioidosis can present as a mediastinal mass that mimics tuberculosis or malignancy. During the initial phase of treatment of melioidosis, the appearance of new lymph nodes or an increase {{in the size of the}} existing lymph nodes does not mean treatment failure. Inexperienced clinicians may consider this as treatment failure and may switch treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report documenting this phenomenon in melioidosis cases. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{usual way}} of {{dissemination}} of an uveal malignant melanoma comprises hematogenous metastases to various organs, liver {{in the first}} place.

40|$|Pilomatrixoma (pilomatrixoma, calcifying {{epithelioma}} of Malherbe) {{is a relatively}} uncommon, benign neoplasm arising from the skin adnexa. The tumor can cause diagnostic difficulty {{not only for the}} clinician but also for the cytologist. Case A 62 -year-old woman presented with a right submandibular swelling of 4 months 9 ̆ 2 duration. The clinical findings were highly suspicious for malignancy. A fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed. Three preliminary differential diagnoses were offered: mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the submandibular salivary gland, squamous cell carcinomatous deposit in a <b>submandibular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and calcifying odontogenic tumor. Computed tomography demonstrated no bony lesion. No primary site of squamous cell carcinoma could be identified. An excisional biopsy of the swelling was performed, and the histologic diagnosis of pilomatrixoma was made. Conclusion: The cytologic presentation of pilomatrixoma of the right submandibular region can masquerade as that of a malignant tumor, in this case mucoepidermoid carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma or odontogenic tumor.

Malignant melanoma (MM) is a neoplasm of melanocytic origin that arises from a benign melanocytic lesion or de novo from melanocytes within otherwise normal mucosa or skin. It is one of most biologically unpredictable and deadly of all human neoplasms. It is third most common skin cancer, and accounts for 5 % of all tumours. Although it comprises 1. 3 % of all cancers, MM of oral cavity accounts for only 0. 2 to 8 % of all reported melanomas.

40|$|In {{order to}} study a {{possible}} difference in the induction of local immunological responses in the oral mucosa after different immunization pathways, Wistar rats were immunized with ovalbumin by different routes, (i) via the <b>submandibular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> (ii) via the Peyer's patches and (iii) via the hindpad. The local reaction after antigen challenge was compared with the systemic humoral response. To study the local reaction, the homologous antigen was injected in the oral mucosa. This resulted in a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction, being the same in extent and character for all immunization pathways. The humoral response was evaluated by serum antibody production (antiovalbumine IgG). It was shown that the antibody production obtained by immunization via the Peyer's patches was significantly smaller than that in the rats immunized via other pathways. The conclusion was that the induction of a local cellular reaction was independent of the antigen pathway, whereas serum antibody production depended on the route, i. e. antigen administration via the <b>submandibular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and the hindpad {{was significantly higher than}} via the Peyer's patches.

An enlarged right <b>submandibular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was also noted. Results: An incisional biopsy was suggestive of MCC. Staged surgical excision with rapid paraffin sections was performed. The tumor cells were seen invading the tarsal plate and adjacent to the palpebral conjunctiva but not into the epidermis. MCC was confirmed using immunohistochemical stains and neuroendocrine markers (cytokeratins Cam 5. 2, AE 1 / 3, CK 20, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and Leu 7).

40|$|Richter’s {{syndrome}} {{is the development}} of high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin lymphoma in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) /small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). In most patients with Richter’s syndrome, the high-grade NHL is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Only a small minority of CLL/SLL patients develop T-cell malignancies. Herein, we describe a 40 -year-old male patient presenting with peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) in the submandibular salivary gland, two years after the diagnosis of CLL/SLL. The PTCL-NOS consisted of small lymphocytes, which complicated diagnosis. Immunohistochemical, cytological, and molecular studies allowed the correct diagnosis of composite lymphoma (SLL/PTCL-NOS) of the submandibular salivary gland. The PTCL-NOS had a cytotoxic phenotype and aberrant expression of CD 79 a.
