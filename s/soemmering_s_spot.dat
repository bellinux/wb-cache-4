40|$|In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} {{the mechanism of}} tissue welding, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the ultrastructural changes {{on the surface of}} dura mater and peripheral nerves after CO 2 laser welding. The dura mater and the epineurium of the nerves was welded with a CO 2 laser at 100 mW with pulses of 1. 0 <b>s</b> (<b>spot</b> size 320 microns), both with and without additional use of a protein solder (egg white). The specimens were immediately examined using SEM. The laser tissue bonding mechanism is collagen-to-collagen attachment. After laser irradiation, the collagen fibrils are swollen, densely packed, and fused together. When a protein solder is used, the coagulated solder forms a solid bridge between the tissue edges, which is melted on and between the collagen fibrils. Laser welds in dura mater and peripheral nerves are the result of collagen-to-collagen bonding. In solder-assisted laser welds, the tissue connection is made by an internal and an external matrix of coagulated solde...|$|R

At the same time, cloud management brokers, who act as middlemen and aggregators for cloud computing service resources, have been able to replace spot resources with service-level agreement (SLA) -based services at a lower cost. In this research, we investigate the key variables that affect spot market users’ willingness-to-pay for SLA-based cloud computing services. Leveraging our empirical analysis of historical spot market prices for cloud computing service risk, we propose a model that includes key market and user variables that impact a user’s willingness-to-pay for SLA-based cloud computing services.
