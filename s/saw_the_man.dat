5|$|The Smiths <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> {{at around}} 22:00 on Rua da Escola Primária, 500 yards (457 m) from the McCanns' apartment, {{walking away from}} the Ocean Club and toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach. He was {{carrying}} a girl aged 3–4 years. She had blonde hair and pale skin, was wearing light-coloured pyjamas, and had bare feet. The man was mid-30s, 5ft 7in–5ft 9in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. He did not look like a tourist, according to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child. E-fits based on the Smiths testimony were first created in 2008 by Oakley International, private investigators hired by the McCanns, and were publicized in 2013 by Scotland Yard on Crimewatch.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{investigates the}} airbag on Skinner's car, {{which was the}} one used to hit Sharon. Scully defends Skinner to the Office of Professional Responsibility, but it does no good and he is fired. Mulder {{believes}} this was done to weaken the X-Files. Mulder, {{with the help of}} Agent Pendrell finds a face imprint in the airbag which is not Skinner's. He goes to see the prostitute's boss again but discovers that she has been murdered. The agents hope to use Judy, an employee who <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who actually hired the prostitute and use her to set up another meeting with him. They agree to meet at the Ambassador Hotel in an hour. Skinner goes to see his wife, telling her why he could not sign the divorce papers. An alarm on Sharon's vital sign monitor starts sounding, but as Skinner is about to run for help, the old woman once again takes the place of Sharon, beckoning him to come closer. As Skinner leans in, he sees his wife again, now awakened from the coma; she says something inaudible to him.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1643 the {{commander}} of the local Parliamentary forces in Cheshire, Colonel Robert Duckenfield, was ordered to seize Wythenshawe Hall and to remove anything of value that could be found. Forewarned, Robert Tatton recruited a group of more than 50 defenders from among his staff and Royalist friends. After ransacking the nearby village of Northenden the Roundheads arrived at Wythenshawe Hall on 21 November 1643, but they did not find the task of taking it as easy as they had imagined. At one point during the siege the attackers almost took possession of the house in a struggle during which six of the defenders were killed. The Parliamentarians refused a truce to allow the bodies to be taken to the local church for proper services to be held, necessitating their burial in the garden behind the house. One of those killed was the fiancé of Mary Webb, a young woman who had been brought up by the Tattons and had remained in the house with the defenders. Towards the end of the siege Mary <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who had led the attack, Duckinfield's second-in-command Captain Adams, sitting on a wall near the house. Borrowing a musket from one of the defenders, she shot him dead.|$|E

The men leapt over the side to swim in a sail that had been lowered over the side. One of the men, a senior able seaman, jumped in wearing his trousers. In one of the pockets he had his prize money and back pay that he had been saving for several years. The bank notes were destroyed by the water and when the man came aboard and discovered what had happened he began to weep. The Admiral <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> and asked the problem.

[...] "Roger Odell you are convicted, Sir, by your own appearance of tarnishing the British oak with tears. What have you to say in your defence why you should not receive what you deserve?" [...] The man told him what had happened and St Vincent replied [...] "Roger Odell {{you are one of the}} best men in this ship you are moreover a captain of a top and in my life I never saw a man behave himself better in battle than you did in the Victory in the action with the Spanish fleet. To show therefore that your Commander-in-chief will never pass over merit wheresoever he may find it. There is your money Sir!" [...] The Earl produced £70 of his own money and presented it to the surprised sailor [...] "but no more tears mind, no more tears Sir".|$|E

2500|$|Adjoined {{relative}} clause. These languages {{have the}} relative clause completely outside the main clause, {{and use a}} correlative structure to link the two. These languages also have nonreduced relative clauses. Hindi is the most well known such language, and have a structure similar to [...] "Which man I saw yesterday, that man went home" [...] or (with non-fronting of the relativized noun in the relative clause) [...] "I saw which man yesterday, that man went home". Another example is Warlpiri, which constructs relative clauses of a form similar to [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> yesterday, which he was going home". However, it is sometimes said these languages have no relative clauses at all, since the sentences of this form can equally well translate as [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who was going home yesterday" [...] or [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> yesterday when/while he was going home".|$|E

However, although she neither mourned {{the death of her}} sambandham husband nor became a widow, she did observe certain mourning rituals upon the death of the man who had tied her thali. Panikkar argues that this proves that the real, religious marriage is the thalikettu kalyanam, although he also calls it a [...] "mock marriage". He believes that it may have come into existence to serve as a religious demarcation point. Sexual morality was lax, especially outside the higher ranks, and both relationship break-ups and realignments were common; the thali kalyanam legitimised the marital status of the woman in the eyes of her faith prior to her becoming involved in the amoral activities that were common practice.|$|E

2500|$|In non-verb-final {{languages}}, {{apart from}} languages like Thai and Vietnamese with very strong politeness distinctions in their grammars, gapped relative clauses tend, however, to {{be restricted to}} positions {{high up in the}} accessibility hierarchy. With obliques and genitives, non-verb-final languages that do not have politeness restrictions on pronoun use tend to use pronoun retention. English is unusual in that all roles in the embedded clause can be indicated by gapping: e.g. [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who is my friend", but also (in progressively less accessible positions cross-linguistically, according to the accessibility hierarchy described below) [...] "...who I know", [...] "...who I gave a book to", [...] "...who I spoke with", [...] "...who I run slower than". Usually, languages with gapping disallow it beyond a certain level in the accessibility hierarchy, and switch to a different strategy at this point. [...] Classical Arabic, for example, only allows gapping in the subject and sometimes the direct object; beyond that, a resumptive pronoun must be used. Some languages have no allowed strategies at all past a certain point—e.g. in many Austronesian languages, such as Tagalog, all relative clauses must have the shared noun serving the subject role in the embedded clause. In these languages, relative clauses with shared nouns serving [...] "disallowed" [...] roles can be expressed by passivizing the embedded sentence, thereby moving the noun in the embedded sentence into the subject position. This, for example, would transform [...] "The man who I gave a book to" [...] into [...] "The man who was given a book by me". Generally, languages such as this [...] "conspire" [...] to implement general relativization by allowing passivization from all positions — hence a sentence equivalent to [...] "The man who is run slower than by me" [...] is grammatical. Note also that gapping is often used in conjunction with case-marked relative pronouns (since the relative pronoun indicates the case role in the embedded clause), but this is not necessary (e.g. Chinese and Japanese both using gapping in conjunction with an indeclinable complementizer).|$|E
2500|$|The {{novel is}} divided into two parts, {{entitled}} [...] "One" [...] and [...] "Two", both of which are narrated by Tony Webster when he is retired and living alone. The first part begins in the 1960s with four intellectually arrogant school friends, of whom two feature in the remainder of the story: Tony, the narrator, and Adrian, the most precociously intelligent of the four. [...] Towards the end of their school days another boy at the school hangs himself, apparently after getting a girl pregnant. [...] The four friends discuss the philosophical difficulty of knowing exactly what happened. [...] Adrian goes to Cambridge University and Tony to Bristol University. Tony acquires a girlfriend, Veronica, at whose family home he spends an awkward weekend. On waking one morning he finds that he and Veronica's mother, Sarah, are alone in the house, and she apologises for her family's behaviour towards him. Tony and Veronica's relationship fails in some acrimony, as he breaks up with her after she has sex with him. In his final year at university Tony receives a letter from Adrian informing him that he is going out with Veronica. Tony replies to the letter, telling Adrian that in his opinion Veronica was damaged in some way and that he should talk to her mother about it. Some months later he is told that Adrian has committed suicide, leaving a note addressed to the coroner saying that the free person has a philosophical duty to examine the nature of their life, and may then choose to renounce it. Tony admires the reasoning. He briefly recounts the following uneventful forty years of his life until his sixties. At this point Tony's narration of {{the second part of the}} novel – which is twice as long as the first – begins, with the arrival of a lawyer's letter informing him that Veronica's mother has bequeathed him £500 and two documents. These lead him to re-establish contact with Veronica and after a number of meetings with her, to re-evaluate the story he has narrated in the first part. On consulting the lawyers, Tony learns that Veronica has Adrian's diary. This leads him to send Veronica repeated e-mails requesting the diary. Veronica eventually sends Tony a single page of the diary, containing Adrian's musings on life as a series of cumulative wagers. Following this, Veronica meets Tony on the Millennium Bridge in London and gives him the letter he sent to Adrian in his youth. On re-reading it, Tony realises how malicious and unpleasant it was, and how he has erased this from his memory. Nevertheless, he persists in attempting to retrieve the diary from Veronica, which leads to her asking him to meet at a location in North London, where she drives him to see a group of mentally retarded men being taken for a walk by their careworker, one of whom she points out to him. Tony does not understand the significance of this and Veronica leaves him with no explanation. Over the course of several weeks, Tony revisits the location until he is able to relocate the man Veronica showed him in a pub. Tony greets the man saying he is a friend of Veronica's which leads to an upset response from the man. Tony realises from the man's features that this is Adrian's son, and he e-mails Veronica an apology, saying he didn't realise that she and Adrian had a son together. Veronica only responds with the reply [...] "You don't get it, but then you never did." [...] On revisiting the pub where he <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> Tony gets into conversation with the careworker, which reveals that the man is actually the son of Adrian and Veronica's mother, Sarah, making him Veronica's half-brother. Tony realises that his letter to Adrian, telling him to talk to Sarah, was the cause of the affair they had together, that Sarah's son was born with mental issues because of her advanced age and that Adrian killed himself because he could not face the responsibility.|$|E
