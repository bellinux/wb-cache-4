In this thesis, two projects involving the development of radioactive gold- 198 / 199 are described. The first project discusses the first tetradentate Au(III) bis-thiosemicarbazones (Au-ATSM/PTSM) that were synthesized and characterized. At radiotracer levels using Au- 198 / 199 required a high ratio of gold-to-ligand (1 :> 100). Our studies indicated that Au(III) can be coordinated to both ATSM or PTSM ligands. These results allowed for further investigation into a variety of bis-thiosemicarbazide derivatives to coordinate Au(III). The second project involved radioactive gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated in vivo. Three stabilizing agents (<b>starch,</b> <b>gum</b> Arabic, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)) were studied to determine the ease of syntheses of AuNPs, relative stability to aggregation, and toxicity in vivo. Incorporating radioactive Au- 198 / 199 allowed for biodistribution studies by three administration routes (intravenous (IV), intraperitoneal (IP), and intratumoral (IT) injections) in prostate cancer bearing mice. These studies indicated that radioactive (Au- 198 / 199) AuNPs can be used to treat prostate cancer by IT injection. Two of the three stabilizers (gum Arabic and EGCG) were further evaluated for treating prostate tumors in mice. The results indicated that the radioactive AuNPs reduced the tumor size with no apparent toxic effects...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop the best bioencapsulation {{condition}} for potential probiotic bacteria to control Edwardsiella tarda infection in climbing perch, Anabas testudineus larvae. Preliminary metagenomic analyses unveiled the pathogenic bacteria (e. g. Edwardsiella tarda, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Serratia marcescens) and beneficial bacteria (e. g. Bacillus subtilis) were the natural microflora in the climbing perch gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Compared to other pathogens, E. tarda was largely residing in the wild- and farmed-typed A. testudineus GI tract. Multiple in vitro screenings such as antagonistic, hemolytic, antibiotic and bacteriosin-like substance (BLIS) assays were performed in the study {{to determine the best}} probiotic against E. tarda, through isolating and evaluating the microflora isolated from intestines of Oreochromis niloticus, Clarias batrachus, Ophicephalus striatus, Trichogaster pectoralis, Anabas testudineus and Pangasius pangasius. Data suggested that L. lactis subsp. lactis (CF 4 MRS) at > 106 CFU mL- 1 could be effectively used to control E. tarda in laboratory condition. This bacterial isolate also showed a strong antimicrobial activity against other fish pathogens such as P. fluorescens, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumonia, E. coli, A. hydrophila, and S. marcescens. HPLC analysis showed that this antimicrobial activity was not attributed to any compounds but the organic acids i. e. lactic acid. When L. lactis subsp. lactis CF 4 MRS (108 CFU mL- 1) was bioencapsulated in Artemia franciscana, it could be effectively used to protect the live feed against E. tarda up to 50 % of survival rate. Colonization efficiency of the probiotic was also highly demonstrated in A. franciscana when gfp-transformed L. lactis was used in the bioencapsulation process. In addition, this probiotic also improve the production of amylase, protease, lipase and cellulase enzymes in A. franciscana. For the best bacterial encapsulation result, sodium alginate was suggested in the A. franciscana bioencapsulation instead of <b>starch,</b> <b>gum</b> Arabic and gelatin, as it showed the highest total bacterial count in Artemia (2. 44 × 107 CFU mL- 1). To determine the effects of the probiotic on climbing perch larvae, A. testudineus larvae were produced by comparing different hormones (LHRHa and SGnRHa). Results suggested induced breeding using LHRHa was {{the most effective way to}} produce the fish larvae. In the in vivo pathogenic assays, fish larvae were divided into various groups: Artemia nauplii enriched with 108 CFU mL- 1 L. lactis (LA); Nauplii enriched 0. 5 g L- 1 sodium alginate (SA); Nauplii enriched 0. 5 g L- 1 sodium alginate containing 108 CFU mL- 1 L. lactis (LSA); and nauplii only as the control (A). Fish larvae fed with LSA showed highest larval survival rate (50 %) compared to LA (41. 7 %), SA (31. 7 %) and A (20 %). Lysozyme activity was also highest in LSA (13. 89 units mg- 1 protein), followed by LA (10. 00 units mg- 1 protein), SA (8. 33 units mg- 1 protein) and A (1. 33 units mg- 1 protein). The result indicated a strong improvement of immune response in fish larvae when LSA was included in larval diet. In a nutshell, combination of L. lactis CF 4 MRS (108 CFU mL- 1 for 8 h) and alginate in Artemia bioencapsulation could improve survival rate of E. tarda-infected climbing perch larvae through up-regulating their innate immune response...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research task was to accomplish successfully development of the controlled release matrices of Flurbiprofen and ibuprofen. These both are typical members of NSAID's and offer considerable therapeutic effects to relieve the symptoms and subsequent management of chronic inflammatory disorders such as osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and dysmenorrhea. Eudragit polymers were employed as rate controlling agents and consequently, their obvious impact on kinetic, mechanism and pattern of drug release was investigated. This highly skillful task did require primarily, initial preformulation studies to rule out drug identification, as well as solubility profiles. The drug and polymer as well as drug, polymer and co excipients compatibilities were also seriously addressed. Different codes were used to produce a set of formulations involving Eudragit L 100, L 55 and S 100 respectively by employing different drug to polymer ratios for both Flurbiprofen as well as Ibuprofen without any further addition of co-excipients. Moreover, same formulations were also developed in which primary filler (lactose) was partially replaced with co-excipients such as starch, CMC, HPMC, Gum Acacia and Gum tragacanth respectively. Ultimately {{the impact of these}} co-excipients upon drug release from fabricated matrices was also noted. Official procedures were employed to describe the Micromeritics studies of pure drugs a s well as respective physical mixtures of the formulation. The results provided puzzling statements about the flow of the pure drugs describing poor flow behavior. This problem was rectified by developing physical mixtures of different ingredients including magnesium stearate as a result, an enhanced and improved flow properties were exhibited. This was indispensable and prominent step in tablet preparation. Direct compression method was adopted as preferred procedure to get matrix tablets. Matrix tablets formed under such a tidy situation under go physico-chemical assessment according to official procedures. These test protocols included dimensional, friability, hardness, weight variation and content uniformity tests. All these searching checks were within official limits. In-vitro dissolution tests were performed for matrix tablets by selecting rotating basket method (USP method 1) with phosphate buffer of PH 7. 4 as recommended dissolution medium. Matrices having Eudragit L 100 enhanced the drug release more efficiently as compared to other grades. The leading factors affecting rates and kinetics of drug release from matrices included particle size, drug to polymer ratio and viscosity grades. Various co-excipients incorporated due to progressive replacement of lactose (Primary filler) such as CMC, HPMC, <b>Starch,</b> <b>Gum</b> Acacia and Gum Tragacanth caused enhanced drug release i. e within 3 - 5 hours. Different kinetic models were fitted to the data of drug release from the matrices. Korseymerpeppas equation best fitted the release profile from matrices by giving "n" value that described anomalous non fickian release mechanism for formulations without co-excipients. The similarity factor (f 2) was also determined by comparing dissolution profile of both matrices and conventional dosage forms. The optimized formulations of both drugs were selected by keeping in view description of kinetic models as well as in-vitro dissolution profiles. The optimized formulations were subjected to stability testing in accelerated condition for short term exposure and they offered good stability profiles in accelerated conditions. The optimized tablets were also selected for in-vivo studies to determine in-vivo bioavailability and pharmacokinetic parameters in rabbits. The result deduced, showed test formulation to display extended drug release as compared to reference formulations. Also the test formulations portrayed good linear relationship between in-vitro drug release and in-vivo drug absorption...|$|E

The <b>gums</b> and <b>starches</b> were better disintegrants than sodium starch glycolate, with the gums exhibiting better properties than the starches...|$|R
500|$|Gardein's {{new process}} creates meat-like fibres from vegetables. Ingredients include {{proprietary}} formulations of proteins (slow-cooked soy, wheat and pea), organic flours (kamut, amaranth, millet, quinoa), potato <b>starch,</b> modified vegetable <b>gum,</b> organic beet fibers, and carrot fibers.|$|R
5|$|Baconnaise {{contains}} no bacon, artificial flavors, or MSG, {{but the actual}} process and ingredients in the product are a trade secret. A complete list of the ingredients includes: soybean oil, water, egg yolk, gluconic acid, yeast extract, stabilizer (microcrystalline cellulose, modified food <b>starch,</b> xanthan <b>gum,</b> guar gum, gum arabic), cultured dextrose, salt, sugar, dehydrated garlic, paprika, dehydrated onion, spice, natural smoke flavor, natural flavors, tocopherols, calcium disodium EDTA, and autolyzed yeast extract.|$|R

50|$|Starch always {{leaves the}} printed cloth {{somewhat}} harsh in feeling (unless modified carboxymethylated starches are used), but very dark colours can be obtained. Gum Senegal, gum arabic or modified guar gum thickening yield clearer and more even tints than does starch, suitable for lighter colours but less suited for very dark colours. (The gums apparently prevent the colours from combining fully with the fibers.) A printing stock solution {{is mostly a}} combination of modified <b>starch</b> and <b>gum</b> stock solutions.|$|R
40|$|During {{traditional}} {{industrial processing}} {{of fruit and}} vegetable derived foods, consideration of the eventual retention, bio-accessibility or bio-availability of nutrients has hitherto been a secondary priority. Indeed standard processing of soups and sauces involves treating {{all ingredients in a}} similar way, usually by prolonged heat treatment and results in both lowered nutritional value and sensory quality of food products. Such products are typically structured using various additives including <b>starches,</b> <b>gums</b> and stabilizers, which consumers regard as unnatural, rather than exploiting the endogenous structuring potential of the fruit and vegetable ingredients as available at the farm gate. Recent studies undertaken within the EU sponsored 2 ̆ 7 Healthy Structuring 2 ̆ 7 project have shown how to design an industrially manufactured product with good sensory qualities that is natural and nutritious. The strategy has been to use the inherent structural and nutritional properties of the raw material ingredients, on the one hand to ensure the textural quality of the final product without the use of artificial gums or stabilizers and, on the other hand to optimize the nutritional quality of the final product. This review briefly summarizes both the approach taken and the results obtained within the project...|$|R
