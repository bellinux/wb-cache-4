DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Sample holder for cryo-conservation {{of biological}} or medical materials (20) comprises a number of <b>holding</b> <b>frames</b> (21, 22) arranged along the bundle (10) of tubular, flexible sample chambers (11, 12). The spaced, rectangular <b>holding</b> <b>frames</b> form a carrier on which the process chambers are arranged adjacently. Inter-frame spacing exceeds frame thickness. The frames lie concisely together along the bundle. They form a stack (30) held by a clamp. One, more or all frames integrate data memory, or it lies between them. Sample chambers are fastened to the frame, forming a plane side surface parallel to the planar extent of the frame. Area of the sample chamber cross section varies along its length, optionally periodically. The chambers are subdivided by chamber walls. The chamber wall has pores or is a dialysis membrane. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the corresponding method of manufacture. USE - A sample holder for cryo-conservation of biological or medical materials, including cells, tissues, fluids and organs. ADVANTAGE - Construction is simplified, overcoming conventional manufacturing difficulties. Handling is facilitated, especially when charging with samples, freezing and during subsequent sample extraction. The design is suitable for large-scale cryo-conservation...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The carrier (10) for a sample chamber, {{especially for the}} preservation of biological samples at very low temperatures, has a <b>holding</b> <b>frame</b> (20) in two sections (30, 40) to position the chambers. The sections are held together by a release lock (50), with their side surfaces (31, 41) against each other and the sample chamber secured between them. The side surfaces are profiled so that, when they are flush against each other, holders (21 - 25) are formed to take the sample chambers in fixed positions. USE - The carrier is for the storage and preservation of biological samples at temperatures below - 100 deg. C, e. g. suspended cells, cell groups and cell components. It is used in cell biology and molecular biotechnology applications. ADVANTAGE - The sample chambers are held securely, so that the samples retain their vitality, and they can be extracted selectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Pitting {{corrosion}} is a {{great concern}} when the integrity of ship's hull structures is considered. Corrosion pits with a conical shape are typically observed on coated <b>hold</b> <b>frames</b> in way of cargo holds of bulk carriers which exclusively carry coal and iron ore. Therefore, {{it is important to}} investigate the effect of pitting corrosion on local strength of <b>hold</b> <b>frames</b> of bulk carriers. In the present study, a series of 3 -point bend tests with structural models which consist of web, shell and face plates has been conducted. In these tests, a concentrated load has been vertically applied at the center of simply supported models so that shear load would act on the web plate with artificial pits. In this testing condition, load increased even after shear buckling occurred. When there is artificial pitting, fracture of web plates occurs due to strain concentration at the pits. It has been revealed that the empirical formula, which was developed based on non-linear FE-analyses, overestimates the equivalent thickness for the shear ultimate strength obtained in the present experiment, because the effect of web fracture is not taken into account in the analyses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Zero-order hold devices (ZOH) {{are mainly}} used in digital control {{applications}} {{to obtain the}} output analog signals of digitally implemented controllers. However, it is proved that <b>special</b> <b>hold</b> devices such as the fractional order hold device (FROH) can improve, if properly tuned, the performance of hybrid control systems. Although the applicability of these devices has been theoretically studied in numerous works, there is no report of real experimentation with digital controllers that include <b>special</b> <b>hold</b> devices for the control signal interpolation. This lack of real application experiments is mainly due to the difficulties encountered in implementing such hold devices with the processing speed and configurability that real-time digital controllers require. This paper describes a totally configurable digital design of a FROH device, adequate for any digital control system platform. The implementation of an 8 -bit resolution FROH prototype {{has been carried out}} and its performance tested on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) ...|$|R
