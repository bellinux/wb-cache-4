40|$|Background: Facial {{features}} {{are regarded as}} representative and reliable characteristics for diagnosing a person's Sasang Constitution (SC). However, the description of these features tends {{to depend on the}} interpretation and the opinion of the doctor that follows the SC approach. In this paper, we performed a facial feature analysis of <b>SC</b> <b>types</b> in an objective and quantitative manner. Here, site-to-site variability can be an obstacle to properly analyzing facial features when images are taken from various sites, which may have different experimental environments. A compensation technique to reduce the site-to-site variability was proposed before performing the feature analysis. Methods: The frontal and profile images of 1464 patients recruited from various oriental medical clinics (19 sites) were used. Candidate feature variables were created, which were inspired by the facial characteristics of the <b>SC</b> <b>types</b> described in the Sasang constitutional medicine literature. To resolve the problems involved in processing data collected from various sites with heterogeneous experimental environments, a compensation technique was proposed. Statistical analysis techniques were employed to observe the differences among the <b>SC</b> <b>types</b> and to demonstrate how effectively the site-to-site variability was reduced. Results: The facial features that were significant for diagnosing the <b>SC</b> <b>types</b> were identified by a statistical analysis, and it was verified that the compensation technique reduced the site-to-site variability produced by the differences in photographic distance. Conclusion: It is noted that the significant facial features represent common characteristics of each <b>SC</b> <b>type</b> {{in the sense that we}} collected extensive opinions from many Sasang constitutional medicine doctors with various points of view. Additionally, a compensation method for the photographic distance is needed to find the significant facial features. We expect these findings and the related compensation technique to contribute to establishing a scientific basis for the precise diagnosis of <b>SC</b> <b>types</b> in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|The Sasang {{constitutional}} {{medicine has}} long been applied to diagnose and treat patients with various diseases. Studies have been conducted for establishment of scientific evidence supporting Sasang Constitutional (SC) diagnosis. Recent human microbiome studies have demonstrated individual variations of gut microbiota which can be dependent on lifestyle and health conditions. We hypothesized that gut microbial similarities and discrepancies may exist across <b>SC</b> <b>types.</b> We compared the difference of gut microbiota among three constitutions (So-Yang, So-Eum, and Tae-Eum), along with the investigation of anthropometric and biochemical parameters. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were predominant phyla in all <b>SC</b> <b>types.</b> The median plot analysis suggested that Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes appeared more abundant in SE and TE, respectively, in the male subjects of 20 – 29 years old. At the genus level, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides manifested the difference between SE and TE types. For anthropometry, body weight, body mass index, and waist circumference of the TE type {{were significantly higher than}} those of the other types. Overall, findings indicated a possible link between <b>SC</b> <b>types</b> and gut microbiota within a narrow age range.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{production}} of staphylocoagulase (SC) causing the plasma coagulation {{is one of}} the important characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus. Although SCs have been classified into 10 serotypes based on the differences in the antigenicity, genetic bases for their diversities and relatedness to chromosome types are poorly understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compared the nucleotide sequences of 105 SC genes (coa), 59 of which were determined in this study. D 1 regions, which contain prothrombin-activating and -binding domains and are presumed to be the binding site of each type-specific antiserum, were classified into twelve clusters having more than 90 % nucleotide identities, resulting to create two novel <b>SC</b> <b>types,</b> XI and XII, in addition to extant 10 types. Nine of the twelve <b>SC</b> <b>types</b> were further subdivided into subtypes based on the differences of the D 2 or the central regions. The phylogenetical relations of the D 1 regions did not correlate exactly with either one of agr types and multilocus sequence types (STs). In addition, genetic analysis showed that recombination events have occurred in and around coa. So far tested, STs of 126 S. aureus strains correspond to the combination of <b>SC</b> <b>type</b> and agr type except for the cases of CC 1 and CC 8, which contained two and three different <b>SC</b> <b>types,</b> respectively. CONCLUSION: The data suggested that the evolution of coa was not monophyletic in the species. Chromosomal recombination had occurred at coa and agr loci, resulting in the carriage of the combinations of allotypically different important virulence determinants in staphylococcal chromosome...|$|R

40|$|Background: Recent {{studies have}} shown a {{predominance}} of type IV SCCmec among the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated in the low endemic areas of Örebro County and the western region of Sweden. However, many of these isolates were not possible to classify as existing subtypes IVa, IVb, IVc or IVd. Methods: We analysed 16 such MRSA isolates by multilocus sequence typing, spa <b>typing,</b> staphylo-coagulase (<b>SC)</b> <b>typing</b> and detection of type IVg and IVh SCCmec. MRSA that remained as unknown type IV SCCmec were investigated by long-range PCR covering the J 1 region; however, only two iso-lates were possible to amplify by PCR. The nucleotide sequences of the entire SCCmec of these two MRSA were determined. In addition, isolates that had unknown <b>SC</b> <b>types</b> were investigated by nucleo-tide sequencing of the coa genes. Results: Five of 16 isolates were classified as type IVg SCCmec, and four isolates had type IVh SCCmec. Two subtypes of type IV SCCmec shared J 1 regions previously identified in other types of SCCmec, types I. 2 and II. 2. The novel elements were designated as type IVi and IVj SCCmec.

Methods: Forty healthy, young (22. 3  ±  1. 4  years) males volunteered to participate in this study. Participants answered an SC questionnaire, and their face shape, voice tone, and body shape were assessed using an SC analysis tool. Thirty-one participants (10 TE, 10 SE, 3 TY, and 8 SY) were selected for further analysis. Collected blood samples were subjected to blood composition analysis, mitochondrial function analysis, and whole-exome sequencing. Results: The SY type showed significantly lower total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels than the SE type. Cellular and mitochondrial Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels were similar across types. All types showed similar basal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates, whereas the TE type showed a significantly lower ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate than the other types.

40|$|Abstract Background Sasang {{constitutional}} medicine (SCM) is {{a unique}} form of traditional Korean medicine that divides human beings into four constitutional types (Tae-Yang: TY, Tae-Eum: TE, So-Yang: SY, and So-Eum: SE), which differ in inherited characteristics, such as external appearance, personality traits, susceptibility to particular diseases, drug responses, and equilibrium among internal organ functions. According to SCM, herbs that belong to a certain constitution cannot be used in patients with other constitutions; otherwise, this practice may result in no effect or in an adverse effect. Thus, the diagnosis of <b>SC</b> <b>type</b> is the most crucial step in SCM practice. The diagnosis, however, tends to be subjective {{due to a lack}} of quantitative standards for SC diagnosis. Methods We have attempted to make the diagnosis method as objective as possible by basing it on an analysis of quantitative data from various Oriental medical clinics. Four individual diagnostic models were developed with multinomial logistic regression based on face, body shape, voice, and questionnaire responses. Inspired by SCM practitioners’ holistic diagnostic processes, an integrated diagnostic model was then proposed by combining the four individual models. Results The diagnostic accuracies in the test set, after the four individual models had been integrated into a single model, improved to 64. 0 % and 55. 2 % in the male and female patient groups, respectively. Using a cut-off value for the integrated SC score, such as 1. 6, the accuracies increased by 14. 7 % in male patients and by 4. 6 % in female patients, which showed that a higher integrated SC score corresponded to a higher diagnostic accuracy. Conclusions This study represents the first trial of integrating the objectification of SC diagnosis based on quantitative data and SCM practitioners’ holistic diagnostic processes. Although the diagnostic accuracy was not great, it is noted that the proposed diagnostic model represents common rules among practitioners who have various points of view. Our results are expected to contribute as a desirable research guide for objective diagnosis in traditional medicine, as well as to contribute to the precise diagnosis of <b>SC</b> <b>types</b> in an objective manner in clinical practice. </p...|$|R
