An analytical {{model of a}} ballasted rail track with <b>sub-ballast</b> layer has been proposed by considering the rail as viscous-elastic continuous beam discretely supported, at four levels of elasticity.

This paper presents a study on the use of geosynthetic reinforcement to reduce the consumption of good-quality <b>sub-ballast</b> material in a railway track in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Six test sections on the railway were instrumented and monitored for a period of 2 years. Nonwoven geotextile and a geogrid were used as reinforcement in different positions in the subballast. The results obtained showed that the presence of geosynthetic reinforcement reduced the strains mobilised in the <b>sub-ballast,</b> reduced the breakage of ballast element, and allowed the use of a cheaper alternative material in the <b>sub-ballast</b> construction.

The tests were conducted at frequencies varying from 10 - 30 Hz. This frequency range is generally representative of Australian Standard Gauge trains operating up to 160 km/h. The discrete element method (DEM) was also used to model geocell-reinforced <b>sub-ballast</b> under plane strain conditions. The geocell was modelled by connecting a group of small circular balls together to form the desired geometry and aperture using contact and parallel bonds. Tensile and bending tests were carried out to calibrate the model parameters adopted for simulating geocell. To model irregularly-shaped particles of <b>sub-ballast,</b> clusters of bonded circular balls were used. The simulated load-deformation curves of the geocell-reinforced <b>sub-ballast</b> assembly at varying cyclic load cycles were in good agreement with the experimental observations. The results indicated that geocell decreased the vertical and lateral deformation of <b>sub-ballast</b> assemblies at any given frequency.

40|$|Hot {{bituminous}} mixtures {{are becoming}} {{widely used in}} modern railway tracks in the <b>sub-ballast</b> layer. The reason is that these materials allow for both an increase in bearing capacity and greater protection of the substructure respect the traditional granular <b>sub-ballast.</b> Despite these advantages, {{the fact that these}} materials are manufactured at a temperature of 160 °C means that their application can lead to an important increase in construction costs, pollution and energy consumption. This paper aims to study the possibility of using WMA manufactured at lower temperatures, as bituminous <b>sub-ballast,</b> in order to save energy and reduce emissions throughout the production process, as well as diminish the global costs of this layer. To this end, this study focuses on a comparison of the mechanical behaviour of warm and hot bituminous mixtures as <b>sub-ballast</b> under various loading conditions.

40|$|Upon {{repeated}} train loading, <b>sub-ballast</b> aggregates, placed {{underneath a}} ballast layer in rail track, become degraded and fouled by the progressive accumulation of external fine particles such as mud-pumping of soft subgrade, seriously decreasing the shear strength and drainage {{capacity of the}} track. This paper presents {{a study of the}} load-deformation response of geocell-reinforced <b>sub-ballast</b> under cyclic loads using laboratory tests and discrete element method (DEM). A series of large-scale cubical triaxial tests with and without geocell inclusions are conducted in the laboratory and simulated in DEM to investigate the beneficial effect of the geocells in decreasing the lateral and vertical deformations of railway subballast. Irregularly-shaped particles of <b>sub-ballast</b> are modelled by connecting and bonding of many circular balls together at appropriate sizes and positions. The geogcell was simulated by bonding many small spheres together to build a desired geometry and structure. The load-deformation behaviour of the geocell-stabilised <b>sub-ballast</b> specimen at varied load cycles predicted from the DEM modelling agrees well with those measured experimentally, showing that the proposed DEM model in this study is able to capture the deformation behaviour of the <b>sub-ballast</b> stabilised by the geocell. Additionally, the DEM modelling also provides insight into the distribution of contact forces, average contact normal and shear forces, which cannot be determined experimentally.

40|$|The {{discrete}} element {{method has}} been used to simulate cyclic loading of geogrid-reinforced ballast under confined and unconfined conditions. For the confined condition, box tests have been simulated on unreinforced samples and reinforced samples with different geogrid positions and geogrid apertures. The response of the ballast layer reinforced with geogrid under repeated loading agrees with experimental results. It was found that the optimum location of geogrid is 100 mm depth from base, and the triaxial geogrid outperforms biaxial geogrid. For the unconfined condition, cyclic loading of a trough of ballast (the Composite Element Test (CET) devised by Brown et al.

The ballast and <b>sub-ballast</b> layers have been idealized by Pasternak shear layer. The geosynthetic layer is represented by a stretched rough elastic membrane. Burger model has been used to characterize the soft clay subgrade. Numerical solutions have been obtained by adopting the finite difference scheme combined with non-dimensioning the governing equations of the proposed model. The results confirm that the present model is quite capable of predicting the time-dependent settlement response of geosynthetic reinforcement railway track system placed on soft clay subgrade. The surface settlement profile and mobilized tensile load of geosynthetics has been evaluated by considering variation in the wheel load, sleeper width, thickness of ballast and <b>sub-ballast</b> layers and shear modulus of ballast and <b>sub-ballast</b> layers. It has been observed that an increase in the sleeper width by 24 % results in the reduction in central settlement and mobilized tensile load by 6. 5 % and 20. 1 %, respectively. It was found that with a 50 % increase in the thickness of the ballast layer, the central settlement has decreased by 7. 3 % and the mobilized tension at the zone of maximum curvature has increased by 24. 6 %. However, with an increase in the thickness of the <b>sub-ballast</b> layer, a considerable reduction in both central settlement and the mobilization of tension on geosynthetic has been noticed.

One of the objectives of this protocol {{is to establish a}} methodology for quality control of construction layers by different available test methods. Nondestructive testing (NDT) methods are currently very attractive due to their ability to provide information about layer thickness and state condition without causing damage or requiring the removal of material samples. Within the NDT available, ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a very fast and reliable technique, whose advantage is the repeatability and the capability of acquiring continuous data. To reach the proposed goal, a trial embankment was constructed with different materials, layer’s thicknesses, water contents and compaction energy levels. GPR was used in two embankments, in order to detect the thickness of the <b>sub-ballast</b> layer located over the compacted sand layer and its uniformity along the track, but also along the cross-section of the track. In order to control some parameters of the <b>sub-ballast</b> layer, like thickness and uniformity, several metallic plates had been used in the base of the <b>sub-ballast</b> layer, along an alignment.
