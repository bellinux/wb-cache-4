5|$|The {{graphics}} {{have been}} improved from Diamond and Pearl. The dialog boxes of previous games {{have been changed}} to speech balloons that appear over other characters' heads, allowing more than one character to speak at once. Japanese players can have kanji appear on screen, rather than only hiragana and katakana. During battles, the sprites of the Pokémon are fully animated and the camera changes position to highlight specific parts of the battle. In addition to continuing the day and night cycle introduced in Gold and Silver, Black and White introduces a seasonal cycle, with the seasons advancing every month rather than being linked to the calendar. Outside areas appear differently depending on the season, such as changing of leaves in autumn or <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in winter. Certain areas are only accessible during certain seasons, and different Pokémon {{can be found in the}} wild in winter where others are encountered in the other seasons. The Pokémon Deerling and Sawsbuck change their physical appearance to match the seasons.|$|E

25|$|The {{ocean is}} at its coldest in February or early March, thus around coastal areas February is often the coldest month, but inland {{there is little to}} choose between February and January as the coldest. Temperatures tend to drop lowest on late winter nights inland, in the {{presence}} of high pressure, clear skies, light winds and when there is <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> On occasions, cold polar or continental air can be drawn in over the United Kingdom to bring very cold weather.|$|E
25|$|In the hardest-struck areas, snowmobiles {{became the}} only viable method of transportation. In Western New York and {{southern}} Ontario, snow which was accumulated on frozen Lake Erie and <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> {{at the start of}} the blizzard provided ample material for the high winds to blow into huge drifts. The combination of bitter cold, high winds, and blowing snow paralyzed areas affected by the storm. Lake Ontario rarely freezes over, which meant northern New York had to deal with considerable lake effect snow. Coupled with the existing snow cover and wind, this had a similar effect.|$|E

The customers were given jackets to protect themselves from the cold. This initiative, which started in various Indian cities on 22 October 2014, will continue throughout the working hours for several weekends. Nikhil Madhok said that this was done to give people an experience of how it feels on Everest.|$|E

25|$|In winter, Daytona Beach has weather {{conditions}} typical of cities on the Florida peninsula. The coolest months are from December through February; average daytime highs range from 65 to 70°F (18 to 21°C) and nighttime lows are near 50 F (10°C). Occasional cold fronts often drop the daytime temperatures into the 50s F with {{nights in the}} 30s F a few times each month. Like much of Florida, Daytona Beach often can be very dry in late winter and early spring, and brush fires and water restrictions can be an issue. Daytona Beach averages only 6 frosts per year according to the National Weather Service office in Melbourne. There is no record of <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in Daytona Beach in the last 109 years; however, snow flurries have been observed twice since 1880 – on January 1, 1977 and in January 2010.|$|E
25|$|The prisoners waited about a {{week for}} a moonless night, and on Friday 24 March the escape attempt began. As night fell, those {{allocated}} a place moved to Hut 104. Unfortunately for the prisoners, the exit trap door of Harry was frozen solid and freeing it delayed the escape {{for an hour and a}} half. Then it was discovered that the tunnel had come up short of the nearby forest; at 10.30 p.m. the first man out emerged just short of the tree line close to a guard tower. (According to Alan Burgess, in his book The Longest Tunnel, the tunnel reached the forest, as planned, but the first few trees were too sparse to provide adequate cover.) As the temperature was below freezing and there was <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> a dark trail would be created by crawling to cover. To avoid being seen by the sentries, the escapes were reduced to about ten per hour, rather than the one every minute that had been planned. Word was eventually sent back that no-one issued with a number above 100 would be able to get away before daylight. As they would be shot if caught trying to return to their own barracks, these men changed back into their own uniforms and got some sleep. An air raid then caused the camp's (and the tunnel's) electric lighting to be shut down, slowing the escape even more. At around 1 a.m., the tunnel collapsed and had to be repaired.|$|E

After the measurement, the snow is cleared from the board and the board is placed flush with the snow surface to provide an accurate measurement {{at the end of}} the next interval. Melting, compacting, blowing and drifting contribute to the difficulty of measuring snowfall.|$|E

500|$|Global {{climate change}} models (GCMs) {{incorporate}} snow {{as a factor}} in their calculations. Some important aspects of snow cover include its albedo (reflectivity of incident radiation, including light) and insulating qualities, which slow the rate of seasonal melting of sea ice. As of 2011, the melt phase of GCM snow models were thought to perform poorly in regions with complex factors that regulate snow melt, such as vegetation cover and terrain. These models typically derive snow water equivalent (SWE) in some manner from satellite observations of snow cover. The International Classification for Seasonal <b>Snow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ground</b> defines SWE as [...] "the depth of water that would result if the mass of snow melted completely".|$|E
500|$|In {{the field}} snow {{scientists}} often excavate a snow pit {{within which to}} make basic measurements and observations. Observations can describe features caused by wind, water percolation, or snow unloading from trees.Water percolation into a snowpack can create flow fingers and ponding or flow along capillary barriers, which can refreeze into horizontal and vertical solid ice formations within the snowpack. Among the measurements of the properties of snowpacks that the International Classification for Seasonal <b>Snow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ground</b> includes are: snow height, snow water equivalent, snow strength, and extent of snow cover. Each has a designation with code and detailed description. The classification extends the prior classifications of Nakaya and his successors to related types of precipitation and are quoted in the following table: ...|$|E

Records from Council Pass and Divide Meadow also show depth increasing throughout the winter, peaking in April. These two stations average a greater amount of snow than Potato Hill, {{with an average of}} [...] at Council Pass and [...] at Divide Meadow by April.
