5|$|According to Suetonius, the Domus Aurea had a dome that perpetually rotated on {{its base}} in {{imitation}} of the sky. It was reported in 2009 that newly discovered foundations of a round room may be those of a rotating domed dining hall. Also reported in contemporary <b>sources</b> <b>is</b> a ceiling over a dining hall in the palace fitted with pipes so that perfume could rain from the ceiling, {{although it is not}} known whether this was a feature of the same dome. The expensive and lavish decoration of the palace caused such scandal that it was abandoned soon after Nero's death and public buildings such as the Baths of Titus and the Colosseum were built at the site.|$|E

5|$|Before the Baroque era, {{keyboard}} music generally was {{not written}} for one instrument or another, but rather was written {{to be played}} on any keyboard instrument. For this reason, much of the organ's repertoire through the Renaissance period {{is the same as}} that of the harpsichord. Pre-Renaissance keyboard music is found in compiled manuscripts that may include compositions from a variety of regions. The oldest of these <b>sources</b> <b>is</b> the Robertsbridge Codex, dating from about 1360. The Buxheimer Orgelbuch, which dates from about 1470 and was compiled in Germany, includes intabulations of vocal music by the English composer John Dunstaple. The earliest Italian organ music is found in the Faenza Codex, dating from 1420.|$|E
5|$|Desalination is the {{technique}} of removing salts from seawater to leave fresh water suitable for drinking or irrigation. The two main processing methods, vacuum distillation and reverse osmosis, use large quantities of energy. Desalination is normally only undertaken where fresh water from other <b>sources</b> <b>is</b> in short supply or energy is plentiful, as in the excess heat generated by power stations. The brine produced as a by-product contains some toxic materials and is returned to the sea.|$|E

30|$|Two {{evaluation}} metrics were calculated: Number {{and location}} of sources For each session, a sound <b>source</b> <b>was</b> considered as ‘estimated’ if it was detected for at least 25 % of {{the duration of the}} session (30 s). If a <b>source</b> <b>is</b> estimated within a ± 15 ∘ range of the expected direction of an actual sound <b>source,</b> it <b>is</b> considered a true positive. If a sound <b>source</b> <b>is</b> estimated outside that range from an actual sound <b>source,</b> it <b>is</b> considered a false positive. If an actual sound <b>source</b> <b>is</b> not estimated during the experiment, it is considered a false negative. Using these metrics, the precision, recall, and F 1 scores [49] (Chapter 8) of the proposed system’s ability to detect sound <b>sources</b> <b>are</b> calculated. Average error Once estimated, an average absolute error is calculated for every sound <b>source</b> that <b>is</b> deemed true positive, from the direction it is actually located.|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to his usual practice elsewhere in the Historia ecclesiastica, Bede provides no information about his sources for the Cædmon story.

5|$|One {{consequence}} of the reassessment of <b>sources</b> <b>is</b> the reappearance of Troilus in his ancient form of andropais. Troilus takes this form in Giraudoux's The Trojan War Will Not Take Place, his first successful reappearance in the 20th century. Troilus is a fifteen-year-old boy whom Helen has noticed following her around. After turning down the opportunity to kiss her when she offers and when confronted by Paris, he eventually accepts the kiss {{at the end of}} the play just as Troy has committed to war. He is thus a symbol of the whole city's fatal fascination with Helen.|$|E
