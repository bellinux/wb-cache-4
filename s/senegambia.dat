5|$|The {{region was}} governed under {{a number of}} {{different}} names between 1880 and 1960. The area was Upper River from 1880 until 18 August 1890, when it was renamed French Sudan, with its capital at Kayes. On 10 October 1899, French Sudan was divided, with the southern cercles joining coastal colonies, and the rest split into two administrative areas called Middle Niger and Upper Senegal. In 1902, the region again was organized as a unified colony under the name <b>Senegambia</b> and Niger (Sénégambie et Niger). The name changed again in 1904 to Upper Senegal and Niger (Haut Sénégal et Niger). Finally, in 1921, the name changed back to French Sudan (Soudan Français).|$|E

It {{is placed in the}} monotypic genus Addax and family Bovidae. Henri Blainville observed syntypes in Bullock's Pantherion and the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. English naturalist Richard Lydekker stated their type locality to be probably <b>Senegambia,</b> though he did not have anything to support the claim. Finally, from a discussion in 1898, it became more probable that British hunters or collectors obtained the addax from the part of Sahara in Tunisia.|$|E

25|$|The union {{had both}} pragmatic and ideological elements. Because {{it was created}} in {{response}} to security concerns, when that threat was believed finished, the confederation's momentum began to die. Senegal unilaterally pulled out its troops from the Gambia when it was threatened by Mauritania (see Problems with <b>Senegambia's</b> border above). Gambia felt its interests were not being protected. The main platform on which union had been built was also the element on which it foundered. The end came on 23 August 1989, when President Diouf decided it was best that the confederation be placed aside after fruitless talks about a customs union.|$|R

On 23 August 1914, she was attached to the Imperial Japanese Navy's Second Fleet, and after disembarking her Army volunteers at Wei-hai-wei, participated in the campaign against the German colony at Tsingtao. In September, Triumph, together with the destroyer , escorted a convoy carrying British troops for operations against Tsingtao, with Triumph taking part in several bombardments of German positions until the capture of Tsingtao by the Japanese. Triumph was hit by a German shell during a bombardment on 14 October, damaging a mast, and killing one crewman and wounding two more. With Tsingtao in Japanese hands, Triumph returned to Hong Kong for a refit on 19 November 1914.|$|E

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that over 50% of the slaves imported to North America came from areas where Islam was followed by at least a minority population.

25|$|In the United States, colonial South Carolina and Georgia {{grew and}} amassed great wealth from the slave labor {{obtained}} from the <b>Senegambia</b> area of West Africa and from coastal Sierra Leone. At the port of Charleston, through which 40% of all American slave imports passed, slaves from this region of Africa brought the highest prices due to their prior knowledge of rice culture, which was put to use on the many rice plantations around Georgetown, Charleston, and Savannah.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the {{integration}} process, support came {{primarily from the}} two governments and their social elites; neither the Senegalese nor the Gambian people at large were particularly interested in integration. Once the threat of political instability began to dissipate, both sides began {{to move back to}} their traditional fears and stereotypes of the other. The Gambian government (and the Gambian people) began to fear losing their own power and identity through Senegalese engulfment. Hughes and Lewis, in their <b>Senegambia</b> analysis, list many problems with unions which often lead to failure, which this union shared.|$|E
25|$|The social {{stratification}} historically evidenced among the Serer people has been, {{except for one}} difference, {{very similar to those}} found among Wolof, Fulbe, Toucouleur and Mandinka peoples found in <b>Senegambia.</b> They all have had strata of free nobles and peasants, artisan castes, and slaves. The difference is that the Serer people have retained a matrilineal inheritance system. According to Martin Klein – a professor of History specializing in African Studies, the caste systems among the Serer emerged {{as a consequence of the}} Mandinka people's Sine-Saloum guelowar conquest, and when the Serer people sought to adapt and participate in the new Senegambian state system.|$|E
25|$|As a {{political}} unit, <b>Senegambia</b> {{was created by}} dueling French and English colonial forces in the region. Competition between the French and the English began in the 16th century when both started to establish trading centers. Although there was some overlap in their areas of influence, French trade centered on the Senegal River and in the Cap-Vert region and English trade on the Gambia River. The region became more important for both growing empires because West Africa allowed a convenient waystation for trade between Europe and the respective American colonies; critical to that trade was its provision of slaves for the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade.|$|E
25|$|The largest wave of Cuban-based {{music to}} hit Africa {{was in the}} form of salsa. In 1974 the Fania All Stars {{performed}} in Zaire (known today as the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Africa, at the 80,000-seat Stadu du Hai in Kinshasa. This was captured on film and released as Live In Africa (Salsa Madness in the UK). The Zairean appearance occurred at a music festival held in conjunction with the Muhammad Ali/George Foreman heavyweight title fight. Local genres were already well established by this time. Even so, salsa caught on in many African countries, especially in the <b>Senegambia</b> and Mali. Cuban music had been the favorite of Senegal's nightspot in the 1950s to 1960s. The Senegalese band Orchestra Baobab plays in a basic salsa style with congas and timbales, but with the addition of Wolof and Mandinka instruments and lyrics.|$|E
25|$|As {{colonialism}} {{became more}} lucrative, {{especially after the}} development of the Thirteen Colonies, New France, and sugar plantations in the Caribbean, England and France took greater measures to define their spheres of influence in West Africa. From 1500 to 1758, the two powers used their naval power to try to remove each other from the region. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War based in Europe, the British captured major French trading bases along the Senegal River area and formed the first <b>Senegambia</b> as a crown colony. The unified region collapsed in 1779. With the British occupied by the American Revolutionary War in North America, the French recaptured Saint Louis and burned the major British settlement in the Gambia region. The unified region ended officially in 1783 {{in the aftermath of the}} British defeat and independence by the United States.|$|E
25|$|Various {{instruments}} in Africa, {{chief among them}} the kora, feature a skin head and gourd (or similar shell) body. The African instruments differ from early African American banjos in that the necks do not possess a Western-style fingerboard and tuning pegs, instead having stick necks, with strings attached to the neck with loops for tuning. Banjos with fingerboards and tuning pegs are known from the Caribbean {{as early as the}} 17th century. 18th- and early 19th-century writers transcribed the name of these instruments variously as bangie, banza, bonjaw, banjer and banjar. Instruments similar to the banjo (e.g., the Japanese shamisen, Persian tar, and Moroccan sintir) have been played in many countries. Another likely relative of the banjo is the akonting, a spike folk lute played by the Jola tribe of <b>Senegambia,</b> and the ubaw-akwala of the Igbo. Similar {{instruments in}}clude the xalam of Senegal and the ngoni of the Wassoulou region including parts of Mali, Guinea, and Ivory Coast, as well as a larger variation of the ngoni developed in Morocco by sub-Saharan Africans known as the gimbri.|$|E

In Australia there is some migration as the birds move towards the northern coast in the dry season and southward in the wet, and also nomadic movements in association with rodent plagues. Occasionally, some of these birds turn up on Norfolk Island, Lord Howe Island or New Zealand, showing that crossing the ocean is not beyond their capabilities. In 2008, barn owls were recorded for the first time breeding in New Zealand. The barn owl has been successfully introduced into the Hawaiian island of Kauai in an attempt to control rodents, however it has been found to also feed on native birds.|$|E

2500|$|Joof (English {{spelling}} in the Gambia) or Diouf (French spelling in Senegal and Mauritania) is a surname typically Serer. This surname is also spelt Juuf or Juf (in the Serer language). They are {{the same}} people. The differences in spelling is because Senegal was colonized by France, while the Gambia was colonized by Britain. Although spelt differently, they are pronounced the same way. The totem and symbol of the Joof family is the antelope, the symbol of grace, royalty, wisdom, hard work and protection in Serer mythology. The name of their clan is [...] "Njoofene" [...] variations: [...] "Njuufeen" [...] or [...] "Njufeen" [...] (in Serer). Members of this family had ruled over many of the pre-colonial kingdoms of <b>Senegambia,</b> including the Kingdom of Sine, the Kingdom of Saloum and the Kingdom of Baol. The royal princesses (Lingeers) from the Joof family were also given in marriage to the pre-colonial kings and princes of <b>Senegambia.</b> Some of these included the kings of Jolof, kings of Waalo, kings of Cayor and Baol (after 1549 following the Battle of Danki). From these marriages, they provided many heirs to the thrones of these kingdoms. Although usually associated with Serer royalty, the Joof family also figure prominently in Serer religious affairs.|$|E

[...] Using caravels to launch slave raids on coastal inhabitants, the Malian vassal territories were caught off guard by both vessels and the white skins within them. However, the Mali Empire countered the Portuguese raids with shallow-draught watercraft. [...] The Mandekalu inflicted a series of defeats against the Portuguese due to the former’s expert use of poison arrows. [...] The defeats forced Portugal’s king to dispatch his courtier Diogo Gomes in 1456 to secure peace.

2500|$|Still another {{possible}} linguistic source for [...] "Gullah" [...] are the Dyula ethnic group of West Africa, from whom the American Gullah might be partially descended. The Dyula civilization {{had a large}} territory that stretched from Senegal through Mali to Burkina Faso {{and the rest of}} what was French West Africa. These were vast savanna lands with lower population densities. Slave raiding was easier and more common here than in forested areas with natural forms of physical defenses. The word [...] "Dyula" [...] is pronounced [...] "Gwullah" [...] among members of the Akan ethnic group in Ghana and Cote D'Ivoire.

2500|$|In {{the short}} term, the <b>Senegambia</b> Confederation was a pragmatic union {{based on a}} mutual {{security}} interest. As noted, the Senegalese government feared national instability caused by uprisings in either the Gambia or the Casamance region. This fear nearly became reality on 30 July 1981 when Gambian leftists attempted a coup d'état against President Sir Dawda Jawara. At the request of President Jawara, the Senegalese army entered the Gambia and put down the insurrection. The attempted coup resulted in both countries' leaders promoting the unification ideas which had been developing in the region. Léopold Sédar Senghor, first President of Senegal, was one of [...] "" [...] ("the three fathers") of Negritude—a literary and ideologically socialist movement of pan-Africanism, encouraging Africans throughout the Diaspora to embrace their shared culture.
