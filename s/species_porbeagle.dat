5|$|As {{porbeagles}} {{had become}} scarce in the Northeast Atlantic, in the 1960s the Norwegian fishing fleet moved {{west to the}} waters off New England and Newfoundland. A few years later, {{they were joined by}} longline vessels from the Faroe Islands. Norwegian annual catches rose from 1,900 tons in 1961 to over 9,000 tons in 1965; the catch was largely exported to Italy, where porbeagle (smeriglio) is an extremely popular food fish. Again, the stock collapsed, this time in only six years: by 1970 Norwegian catches had fallen to under 1,000 tons per year, and Faroese catches observed a similar trend. With the population decimated, most fishers moved on or switched to other <b>species.</b> <b>Porbeagle</b> numbers gradually recovered in the ensuing 25 years, to about 30% of pre-exploitation levels. In 1995, Canada established an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and became the primary fisher of porbeagles in the region. Between 1994 and 1998, Canadian fishing vessels landed 1,000–2,000 tons per year, which depleted the population to 11–17% of pre-exploitation levels by 2000. Strict regulations and greatly reduced fishing quotas introduced in 2000 have since begun to reverse the stock decline, though recovery of the stock is projected to take decades due to the low productivity of the species. There is evidence that incidental artificial selection caused by heavy fishing has led to a compensatory growth response, i.e. faster growth and earlier maturation.|$|E
40|$|A {{domestic}} fishery for pelagic sharks {{has been}} developing in Atlantic Canada since 1990. Landings consist primarily of three <b>species,</b> <b>porbeagle</b> (Lamna nasus), shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), and blue (Prionace glauca) sharks. A small but increasing quantity is landed as unspecified sharks. Porbeagle sharks are caught primarily in a directed longline fishery while shortfin makos are caught primarily as by-catch in the swordfish longline fishery. Small quantities of all three species are landed as by-catch in other fisheries. Although blue sharks are a significant by-catch in the swordfish and tuna longline fisheries, landings come primarily from a developing directed longline fishery. This developing fishery has been limited by market. Landings in 1994 totalled 1545 t of porbeagle, 157 t of shortfin mako, 113 t of blue, and 107 t of unspecified sharks. Fisheries regulations were amended in 1994 to permit the management of this fishery. A management plan, announced in July 1994, established precautionary catch levels, {{a limited number of}} exploratory licenses, gear restrictions, a prohibition on ‘finning ’ and submission of logbooks. Extreme caution has been advised in the development of this fishery due to elasmobranch life history traits, the history of elasmobranch fisheries, and the lack of information necessary for stoc...|$|E
40|$|Reproductive data {{collected}} from porbeagle, shortfin mako, and blue sharks caught around New Zealand were used to estimate the median length at maturity. Data on clasper development, {{presence or absence of}} spermatophores or spermatozeugmata, uterus width, and pregnancy were collected by observers aboard tuna longline vessels. Direct maturity estimates were made for smaller numbers of sharks sampled at recreational fishing competitions. Some data sets were sparse, particularly over the vital maturation length range, but the availability of multiple indicators of maturity made it possible to develop estimates for both sexes of all three <b>species.</b> <b>Porbeagle</b> shark males matured at 140 – 150 cm fork length and females at about 170 – 180 cm. New Zealand porbeagles therefore mature at shorter lengths than they do in the North Atlantic Ocean. Shortfin mako males matured at 180 – 185 cm and females at 275 – 285 cm. Blue shark males matured at about 190 – 195 cm and females at 170 – 190 cm; however these estimates were hampered by small sample sizes, difficulty obtaining representative samples from a population segregated by sex and maturity stage, and maturation that occurred over a wide length range. It is not yet clear whether regional differences in median maturity exist for shortfin mako an...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} need to {{identify}} shark products in trade, {{in part due to}} the recent listing of five commercially important species on the Appendices of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered <b>Species</b> (CITES; <b>porbeagle,</b> Lamna nasus, oceanic whitetip, Carcharhinus longimanus scalloped hammerhead, Sphyrna lewini, smooth hammerhead, S. zygaena and great hammerhead S. mokarran) in addition to three species listed {{in the early part of}} this century (whale, Rhincodon typus, basking, Cetorhinus maximus, and white, Carcharodon carcharias). Shark fins are traded internationally to supply the Asian dried seafood market, in which they are used to make the luxury dish shark fin soup. Shark fins usually enter international trade with their skin still intact and can be identified using morphological characters or standard DNA-barcoding approaches. Once they reach Asia and are traded in this region the skin is removed and they are treated with chemicals that eliminate many key diagnostic characters and degrade their DNA ("processed fins"). Here, we present a validated mini-barcode assay based on partial sequences of the cytochrome oxidase I gene that can reliably identify the processed fins of seven of the eight CITES listed shark species. We also demonstrate that the assay can even frequently identify the species or genus of origin of shark fin soup (31 out of 50 samples) ...|$|R
