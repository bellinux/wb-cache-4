Late in life Ayn Rand renewed her childhood interest in stamps {{and became an}} enthusiastic collector. Several entertainment and sport personalities {{have been known to}} be collectors. Freddie Mercury, lead singer of the band Queen, collected stamps as a child. His childhood <b>stamp</b> <b>album</b> is {{in the collection of the}} British Postal Museum & Archive. John Lennon of The Beatles was a childhood stamp collector. His <b>stamp</b> <b>album</b> is held by the National Postal Museum.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his acting career, Terence Stamp is an accomplished writer and author. He has published three volumes of his memoirs including <b>Stamp</b> <b>Album</b> (written in tribute to his late mother), a novel entitled The Night, and a cookbook co-written with Elizabeth Buxton to provide alternative recipes {{for those who are}} wheat- and lactose-intolerant.|$|E
25|$|After leaving school, Stamp {{worked in}} a variety of {{advertising}} agencies in London, working his way up to earning a reasonable salary. In the mid‑1950s, he also worked as an assistant to professional golfer Reg Knight at Wanstead Golf Club in east London. He describes this period of his life positively in his 1988 autobiography <b>Stamp</b> <b>Album.</b> He wanted to be an actor, a realisation that came when Stamp found he no longer had to serve two years' National Service after being rejected for having had treatment on his feet.|$|E

25|$|As {{the hobby}} and study of stamps began to grow, <b>stamp</b> <b>albums</b> and <b>stamp</b> related {{literature}} began to surface, {{and by the}} early 1880s publishers like Stanley Gibbons made a business out of this advent.|$|R
60|$|I {{did as he}} asked, {{beginning}} with the day when Jim showed me the passage in the Daily Occidental, and winding up with the <b>stamp</b> <b>album</b> and the Chailly post-mark. It was a long business; and Carthew made it longer, for he was insatiable of details; and it had struck midnight on the old eight-day clock in the corner before I had made an end.|$|E
6000|$|Dinner was scarce done, {{the cloth}} {{was not yet}} removed, when Miss Agnes must needs climb into my lap with her <b>stamp</b> <b>album,</b> {{a relic of the}} {{generosity}} of Uncle William. There are few things I despise more than old stamps, unless perhaps it be crests; for cattle (from the Carthew Chillinghams down to the old gate-keeper's milk-cow in the lane) contempt is far from being my first sentiment. But it seemed I was doomed to pass that day in viewing curiosities, and, smothering a yawn, I devoted myself once more to tread the well-known round. I fancy Uncle William must have begun the collection himself and tired of it, for the book (to my surprise) was quite respectably filled. There were the varying shades of the English penny, Russians with the coloured heart, old undecipherable Thurn-und-Taxis, obsolete triangular Cape of Good Hopes, Swan Rivers with the Swan, and Guianas with the sailing ship. Upon all these I looked with the eyes of a fish and the spirit of a sheep; I think, indeed, I was at times asleep; and it was probably in one of these moments that I capsized the album, and there fell from the end of it, on the floor, a considerable number of what I believe to be called [...] "exchanges." ...|$|E
50|$|Linn also {{published}} a <b>stamp</b> <b>album</b> Stamps of the World.|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} of stamp collecting changed everything.
