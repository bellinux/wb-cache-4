5|$|Tom Comstock {{comes home}} {{the next day}} to find his son {{returned}}, alive but shaken. Black deduces that the paint <b>swatch</b> matches paint used on the vehicle that killed Burke's son; he also realizes that the boys are being kidnapped to force their fathers to confess hidden sins—Comstock's son was returned after he revealed his affair, while Orlando's son was killed because he kept secret a crime involving money. From there, Black sees that Charlie's kidnapping means that Birckenbeuhl is the hit-and-run driver.|$|E
5|$|Birckenbuehl's son Charlie is kidnapped {{from his}} bedroom, again subdued with a cattle prod. Andrews and Black {{discover}} that the boy's goldfish had been poisoned with whiskey, which {{they believe to be}} another message like Comstock's number. The town's swimming instructor, Adam Burke (Brian Taylor) is interviewed, as he had contact with both missing boys through his coaching. Black discovers that Burke's son had been killed in a hit-and-run accident; Black also receives post containing a paint <b>swatch</b> with the number 528 on it, but he is unsure of its meaning.|$|E
25|$|<b>Swatches</b> {{are used}} to {{communicate}} colors accurately. For different media like printing, computers, plastics, and textiles, different type of <b>swatches</b> are used. Generally, the medium which offers the broadest gamut of color shades is widely used across different media.|$|R

5|$|Corgi International Limited made 5-inch {{action figures}} and gadgets (such as a {{voice-activated}} briefcase), {{as well as}} its traditional die-cast toy vehicles. It also created 7-inch figures of characters from the previous films. Scalextric released four racing sets to coincide with the film. Activision released its first James Bond game, also titled Quantum of Solace, which is based on both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. It is the first Bond game to feature Craig's likeness and the first seventh generation console game in the series. <b>Swatch</b> designed a series of wrist watches, each of them inspired by a Bond villain.|$|E
5|$|Ono {{was also}} an {{experimental}} filmmaker who made 16 short films between 1964 and 1972, gaining particular renown for a 1966 Fluxus film called simply No. 4, {{often referred to as}} Bottoms. The five-and-a-half-minute film consists of a series of close-ups of human buttocks walking on a treadmill. The screen is divided into four almost equal sections by the elements of the gluteal cleft and the horizontal gluteal crease. The soundtrack consists of interviews with those who are being filmed, as well as those considering joining the project. In 1996, the watch manufacturing company <b>Swatch</b> produced a limited edition watch that commemorated this film.|$|E

25|$|Another terminological {{difference}} {{is known as}} tension (UK) and gauge (US). Individual crocheters work yarn with a loose or a tight hold and, if unmeasured, these differences can lead to significant size changes in finished garments that have {{the same number of}} stitches. In order to control for this inconsistency, printed crochet instructions include a standard for the number of stitches across a standard <b>swatch</b> of fabric. An individual crocheter begins work by producing a test <b>swatch</b> and compensating for any discrepancy by changing to a smaller or larger hook. North Americans call this gauge, referring to the end result of these adjustments; British crocheters speak of tension, which refers to the crafter's grip on the yarn while producing stitches.|$|E

This 13th to 14th century dating is much too recent for the shroud to have been associated with Jesus of Nazareth. The dating does on the other hand match the first appearance of the shroud in church history.|$|E

In a Plackett-Burman design study, the independent variables of detergent type, concentration, and variation, wash water temperature, soil load, cycle time, and water hardness were assigned high and low values. Wash water temperatures of 27, 38, 49, and 60 degrees C were employed. Viable bacteria were recovered from macerated <b>swatches.</b> Statistical analysis disclosed {{that there was no}} practical difference in the ability of phosphate or phosphate-substitute detergents to reduce the level of S. aureus on the laundered <b>swatches</b> in this controlled design. Analysis did reveal that water temperature was the most significant independent variables. The remaining variables did not appear to have any practical significance upon bacterial reduction. This bacteriological study did not evaluate other essential detergent properties...|$|R

The circuits developed by Intersil for Seiko in 1969–1970 contributed {{to the rise of}} Japanese electronic watches. Intersil and Intel weren't competitors as Intel released a limited set of templated circuits for computers and sold them initially only in the U.S. market, whereas Intersil focused on custom CMOS circuits with low power consumption and sold them worldwide.|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{purpose of}} this project was to research and develop a process that would reduce the cost and improve the environmental efficiency of the present dry-cleaning industry. This second phase of research (see report KCP- 94 - 1006 for information gathered during the first phase) was intended to allow the optimal integration of all factors of ultrasonic fabric cleaning. For this phase, Garment Care performed an extensive literature search and gathered data from other researchers worldwide. The Garment Care-AlliedSignal team developed the requirements for a prototype cleaning tank for studies and acquired that tank and the additional equipment required to use it properly. Garment Care and AlliedSignal acquired the transducers and generators from Surftran Martin-Walter in Sterling Heights, Michigan. Amway's Kelly Haley developed the test protocol, supplied hundreds of test <b>swatches,</b> gathered the data on the <b>swatches</b> {{before and after the}} tests, assisted with the cleaning tests, and prepared the final analysis of the results. AlliedSignal personnel, in conjunction with Amway and Garment Care staff, performed all the tests. Additional planning is under way for future testing by outside research facilities. The final results indicated repeatable performance and good results for single layered fabric <b>swatches.</b> <b>Swatches</b> that were cleaned as a ''sandwich,'' that is, three or more layers...|$|R
