50|$|During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, <b>spring</b> <b>scissors</b> {{were made}} by heating a bar of iron or steel, then {{flattening}} and shaping its ends into blades on an anvil. The center of the bar was heated, bent to form the spring, then cooled and reheated to make it flexible.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>scissors</b> {{continued}} {{to be used in}} Europe until the 16th century. However, pivoted scissors of bronze or iron, in which the blades were pivoted at a point between the tips and the handles, the direct ancestor of modern scissors, were invented by the Romans around 100 AD. [...] They entered common use in not only ancient Rome, but also China, Japan, and Korea, and the idea is still used in almost all modern scissors.|$|E
40|$|Barbels are skin sensory {{appendages}} {{found in}} fishes, reptiles and amphibians. The zebrafish, Danio rerio, develops {{two pairs of}} barbels- a short nasal pair and a longer maxillary pair. Barbel tissue contains cells of ectodermal, mesodermal and neural crest origin, including skin cells, glands, taste buds, melanocytes, circulatory vessels and sensory nerves. Unlike most adult tissue, the maxillary barbel is optically clear, allowing us to visualize the development and maintenance of these tissue types throughout the life cycle. This video shows early development of the maxillary barbel (beginning approximately one month post-fertilization) and demonstrates a surgical protocol to induce regeneration in the adult appendage (> 3 months post-fertilization). Briefly, the left maxillary barbel of an anesthetized fish is elevated with sterile forceps just distal to the caudal edge of the maxilla. A fine, sterile <b>spring</b> <b>scissors</b> is positioned against the forceps to cut the barbel shaft at this level, establishing an anatomical landmark for the amputation plane. Regenerative growth can be measured {{with respect to this}} plane, and in comparison to the contralateral barbel. Barbel tissue regenerates rapidly, reaching maximal regrowth within 2 weeks of injury. Techniques for analyzing the regenerated barbel include dissecting and embedding matched pairs of barbels (regenerate and control) in the wells of a standard DNA electrophoresis gel. Embedded specimens are conveniently photographed under a stereomicroscope for gros...|$|E
5000|$|The Miracle-Gro {{is a line}} of {{lawn and}} garden {{products}} such as pruners, snips, floral knives and <b>spring</b> assisted <b>scissors</b> suited for home gardeners. The Scotts AirShoc line, on the other hand, aims at lawn care professionals and serious DIY’ers. It includes loppers, hedge shears, branch saws and grass and garden shears.|$|R
50|$|In April 2013, Acme {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with The ScottsMiracle-Gro Company to market and sell two lines of lawn and gardening tools branded ‘Scotts’ and ‘Miracle-Gro’. The tools also carry the ‘powered by Clauss technology’ label. The Miracle-Gro line includes pruners, snips, floral knives, <b>spring</b> assisted <b>scissors,</b> while the Scotts AirShoc line are professional lawn & garden tools like loppers, hedge shears, branch saws and grass and garden shears.|$|R
50|$|House {{building}} {{continued in}} the area in the late 1840s with the Birkendale Freehold Land Society building a development of detached and semi detached villas on an area of over nine acres. Each villa had a plot of land of one rood (quarter of an acre) and were occupied mainly by steel industry craftsmen and their families with the original occupants including <b>scissors,</b> <b>spring</b> knife and cutlery manufacturers. Today the Birkendale neighbourhood is a conservation area with 65 houses in total. Sir Stuart Goodwin (1886-1969) founder of the Neepsend Steel and Tool Corporation was born at 120 Upperthorpe; he was one of Sheffield’s top industrialists in the inter war period. He later became one of the City’s most renowned patrons, funding Sheffield’s Christmas illuminations for many years and the Goodwin Sports Centre, he is commemorated by the Goodwin Fountain in the Peace Gardens.|$|R
40|$|A small swab {{soaked in}} topical amethocaine {{and left in}} the lower fornix for a minute is {{particularly}} effective. • Cauterising the space before incision is extremely helpful in limiting both the risk of subconjunctival haemorrhage and that of an unintended extension of the incision. To do this, gently apply the bipolar cautery, barely touching but not pressing down on the conjunctival surface. This also helps to lift the Tenon’s capsule away from the sclera. • Use a pair of <b>spring</b> <b>scissors</b> {{to make a small}} (0. 5 mm long) snip through both the conjunctiva and Tenon’s capsule, 2 to 3 mm behind the limbus in the inferomedial quadrant of the globe. The scissors should not be opened more than halfway. It is essential to find the sub-Tenon’s plane, i. e. to dissect down to bare sclera. It helps to hold the scissor blades so that their plane is perpendicular to the ocular surface instead of being parallel to it (Figure 5). • Use a specially designed blunt cannula to inject the anaesthetic. However, {{if you do not have}} a specially designed cannula, a lacrimal cannula is a suitable alternative. Mount the cannula on a syringe containing the anaesthetic solution. • Pass the cannula through the snip incision. The incision should fit tightly around the cannula. • Advance the cannula backwards with its tip touching and following the curvature of the globe all the way to the retrobulbar space. As the equator is passed, the hand and syringe need to rotate away from the globe so that the cannula tip stays in the space (Figure 6). • Inject the anaesthetic carefully...|$|E
