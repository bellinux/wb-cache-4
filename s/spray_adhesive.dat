50|$|In textile screen printing, a platen is a {{flat board}} onto which the {{operator}} slides the garment. It is generally made of either a plywood laminate or aluminum {{with a rubber}} laminate. Often the platen will be pretreated with a <b>spray</b> <b>adhesive.</b> This allows the garment to effectively become a rigid immobile substrate, especially important when printing multiple colors or utilizing an on-press infrared dryer. The screen is brought parallel {{and close to the}} garment (often within 1/32") and the squeegee pressure then brings the screen into contact with the garment so that the ink transfer may occur. There are many special platen types, such as those for printing sleeves or pockets, vacuum platens, platens with clamps to hold bulky materials such as jackets, and even curved platens for printing on hats.|$|E
50|$|The Melter reappears as an {{employee}} of master villain Baron Zemo (who has upgraded the melting beam to affect all metals) as part of supervillain team the Masters of Evil. He helps <b>spray</b> <b>Adhesive</b> X over the city. The Melter meets Iron Man as the Avengers first meet the Masters, but Iron Man knocks him away using his magnetic repulsor. The Masters were defeated with the Melter being jailed after Iron Man drenches him with water, preventing his beam from working. The Radioactive Man was deported back to China, while the Black Knight and Melter are placed in a cell with bars chemically treated so they cannot be melted. The Masters of Evil have a second encounter with the Avengers after the Black Knight and Melter are broken out of jail by the Enchantress and Executioner. The Melter nearly finishes Iron Man after welding his boots to a roof, but he is stopped by Thor using his uru hammer, which the Melter cannot melt. The Masters of Evil are eventually defeated after Thor transported them and the Avengers to another dimension, with different scientific laws which meant their weapons rebounded. The villains are bound and returned to Earth. The character upgrades his weaponry and battles Iron Man once again, before reappearing {{as part of the}} next version of the Masters of Evil, although the villains are defeated when betrayed by the Black Knight. The Masters of Evil - with the Melter - also accidentally encounter the Avengers during a parade and during the battle are defeated when surprised by the superheroines the Lady Liberators.|$|E

HA- 3676 - 20131 -Bromopropane (1 -BP) is {{a solvent}} {{that is used}} in degreasing, dry cleaning, spray adhesives, and aerosol solvents. Occupational {{exposure}} to 1 -BP {{has been linked to}} neurological illnesses. Animal studies show that 1 -BP may also cause cancer and reproductive disorders. Controls and personal protective equipment are available to protect workers from 1 -BP exposure. Exposure to 1 -BP can cause irritation (for example, of the eyes, mucous membranes, upper airways and skin) and can damage the nervous system. Neurologic effects can appear as headaches, dizziness, loss of consciousness, slurred speech, confusion, difficulty walking, muscle twitching, and/or loss of feeling in arms and legs [Ichihara et al. 2012]. These effects may continue among affected persons even after exposure to 1 -BP has ended [Majersik et al. 2007]. As with many other solvents, workers can be exposed to 1 -BP by breathing in vapor or mists of spray. Workers might also be exposed if the chemical touches their skin because it can be absorbed [Hanley et al. 2006; Frasch et al. 2011]. Additionally, the risk of health effects to workers increases the longer they work with or near 1 -BP. Impacts on health have been seen in workers after exposures for as little as two days, although symptoms are more commonly associated with longer exposure [Ichihara et al. 2012]. Federal OSHA does not currently have a specific exposure standard for 1 -BP; however, employers are required by law to keep their workers safe from this recognized hazard. Degreasing, <b>spray</b> <b>adhesive,</b> aerosol solvent and dry cleaning operations expose workers to air concentrations of 1 -BP greater than the limits set by the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA) and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH).

Artificial light exposure in an Atlas Xenon-Arc Weather-Ometer simulated sunlight exposure through window glass. Marking pen specimens were exposed to 20 and 40 AFUs of light exposure, while adhesive product fabric assemblies were exposed to 40 and 80 AFUs of light. ^ Air-soluble marking pen ink did not “disappear” as manufacturers claimed. Water immersion was the most effect means of ink removal, while eraser pen ink removal treatments had the most dramatic and detrimental effect of color change. ^ Fusible battings exhibited less color change than other adhesive products. Some polyvinyl acetate-based <b>adhesive</b> <b>sprays</b> exhibited more yellowing than others. Both polyamide and polyvinyl alcohol-based fusible webs exhibited undesirable ageing characteristics.

Two patients undergoing surgery due to severe intraoperative hemorrhage and failed hemostasis were excluded, and the remaining 171 patients were randomly divided into two groups: group A (medical adhesive group, n = 89) and group B (control group, n = 82). In group A, a medical <b>adhesive</b> <b>spray</b> was evenly applied after routine electrocoagulation and hemostasis using hemostatic clip after ESD. Patients in group B only treated with routine wound management. Intraoperative and postoperative data were collected and compared. RESULTS: In all 171 patients, ESD was successfully completed. There {{was no significant difference in}} the average treatment time between groups A and B (59. 4 min vs 55. 0 min, respectively). The average length of hospital stay was significantly different between group A and B (8. 89 d vs 9. 90 d, respectively).

40|$|The {{free surface}} impact of solid objects has been {{investigated}} {{for well over a}} century. This canonical problem has many facets that may be studied: object geometry, surface treatment, and diameter; impact speed and angle; and fluid viscosity and surface tension. The problem is further enriched with the consideration of varying mass ratios and rotational velocities. This thesis uses advanced high-speed imaging and visualization techniques to discover underlying physics and further our understanding of these phenomena through improvements to analytical solutions describing criterion such as cavity formation, depth of deep seal, and trajectory for all impact parameters studied. The topic is extended to the impact of high-speed projectiles or bullets. Through experimentation the trajectory, cavity size, and forces acting on the projectiles are elucidated. Experimentation coupled with improvements to an existing cavitation model lead to an improved bullet design that forms a narrower cavity and achieves higher speeds. Industrial applications include ship slamming, extreme waves and weather on oil platforms, <b>sprayed</b> <b>adhesives,</b> paint aerosols and ink jet printing. In the field of naval hydrodynamics there is particular interest as these problems relate {{to the study of the}} water entry of mines and bullets, and the underwater launching of torpedos and missiles. Physical insight can also be applied to sports performance research relating to the water entry of athletes, reducing drag of swimmers near the free surface, decreasing cavity formation for divers, and the entry and exit of oars in rowing. (cont.) This thesis examines the effect of several key parameters on the water entry physics of spheres at relatively low Froude numbers including: hydrophobic vs. hydrophilic surfaces, mass ratio and rotational velocity. Physical models that predict the depth of deep seal and the effect of dynamic and static wetting angle on cavity formation will be discussed. Theories are derived from physical parameters witnessed through high-speed video image sequences using advanced image processing techniques. New phenomena have been witnessed via these techniques including a wedge of fluid that crosses the cavity in the case of transverse rotational velocity. Furthermore, the images reveal the forces acting on the sphere through the entire trajectory, which adds valuable information for future theoretical models. The discussion continues with the water entry of bullets, which produce water vapor cavities large enough to engulf the projectile (i. e. supercavitation). The effects of speed, geometry and angle of attack on the formation of the subsurface cavity are analyzed through an improved physical model and full scale experimentation.

30|$|Based on {{the results}} of the {{previous}} paper [18], 20  wt% citric acid (CA) was sprayed onto particles and then dried at 80 [*]°C for 12  h to reach a moisture content of about 10 %. Subsequently, the particles were formed into mats using a 300 [*]×[*] 300  mm forming box. The mat of particles was pressed using a hot-pressing machine under various temperature and time conditions, i.e., 140 – 220 [*]°C and 2 – 15  min, respectively. Particleboard size and target density were 300 [*]×[*] 300 [*]×[*] 9  mm and 0.8  g/cm 3, respectively. Particleboard thickness was controlled by a 9 -mm-thick metal bar during the hot-pressing process. In addition, each particleboard was bonded using 12 -wt% PF resin, and 8 -wt% content pMDI was manufactured as a reference. Both the PF resin and pMDI were diluted by acetone of 20 and 10  wt%, respectively, to reduce the viscosity of these adhesives. The particles were used to manufacture the particleboard bonded with PF and pMDI without drying after <b>spraying</b> with <b>adhesive.</b> The mat moisture contents of both particleboard bonded with PF and pMDI before pressing were about 20 and 6 %, respectively. The size and target density of each of these boards was {{similar to those of the}} particleboards bonded with CA. Based on our previous research [18], particleboard bonded with PF and pMDI was manufactured at 200 [*]°C for 6  min and 180 [*]°C for 8  min, respectively.|$|R
