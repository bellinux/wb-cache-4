500|$|Ratings are earned through [...] "A" [...] schools, {{which are}} {{attended}} before deployment and after undergoing initial basic training at Recruit Training Command, Great Lakes, Illinois, or (less commonly) by [...] "striking" [...] for a rating through on-the-job training (OJT) in the Fleet. Some members may undergo additional training in a [...] "C" [...] school either {{before or after}} a tour of duty. Upon completion, they are assigned a four-digit Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) code, which identifies a specific skill within their <b>standard</b> <b>rating.</b> This defines what jobs they are qualified to do. [...] For example, some billets might not only require a Corpsman First Class, but might specify that he/she has NEC 8402 (Submarine Force Independent Duty), NEC 8403 (Fleet Marine Forces Reconnaissance Independent Duty Corpsman), or any other of several NECs depending upon the billet's requirements.|$|E

40|$|Value Added Tax (VAT) <b>standard</b> <b>rate</b> Laffer curves are {{estimated}} for the European Union of twenty seven countries (EU 27) {{over the period}} 1995 - 2011, using a twice continuously differentiable VAT revenue quadratic flexible functional form. A business cycle effect on the Laffer curve is found. In recession years, VAT revenue is typically lower, the curve steeper, and the VAT <b>standard</b> <b>rate</b> that maximises VAT revenue slightly smaller than previously. These results can be explained with reference {{to changes in the}} composition of consumption and VAT collection enforcement. A countercyclical VAT <b>standard</b> <b>rate</b> policy (procyclical fiscal policy), observable in a few countries, not only increases the underlying business cycle volatility but may also result in long-term instability of VAT revenue. In 2011, the maximum VAT <b>standard</b> <b>rates</b> in expansion and recession were respectively 22. 0 and 21. 5 per cent. Most of the EU 27 countries were operating in the non-prohibitive range of the curve; although Portugal, with a VAT <b>standard</b> <b>rate</b> of 23 per cent, along with several other countries with similar rates, was already operating in the prohibitive range of the curve. VAT <b>standard</b> <b>rate</b> Laffer curves shifted to the left and maximum VAT <b>standard</b> <b>rates</b> declined during the analysed period. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
