We intend to keep this country white and not allow its people to be faced with the problems that at present are practically insoluble {{in many parts of the}} world.|$|E

But the transition required to reduce global human consumption to within sustainable limits involves much larger changes, at all levels and contexts of society.

500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the Soviet {{leadership}} headed by Leonid Brezhnev, Alexei Kosygin and the Politburo, were {{not eager to}} send troops to Afghanistan. The Soviet Politburo decisions were guided by a Special Commission on Afghanistan, which consisted of Yuri Andropov the KGB Chairman, Andrei Gromyko the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Defence Minister Dmitriy Ustinov, and Boris Ponomarev, {{the head of the}} International Department of the Central Committee. The Politburo was opposed to the removal of Taraki and his subsequent murder. According to Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, [...] "Events developed so swiftly in Afghanistan that essentially there was little opportunity to somehow interfere in them. Right now our mission is to determine our further actions, so as to preserve our position in Afghanistan and to <b>secure</b> <b>our</b> influence there." [...] Although Afghan–Soviet relations deteriorated during Amin's short stint in power, he was invited on an official visit to Moscow by Alexander Puzanov, the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, because of the Soviet leadership's satisfaction with his party and state-building policy. Not everything went as planned, and Andropov talked about [...] "the undesirable turn of events" [...] taking place in Afghanistan under Amin's rule. Andropov also brought up the ongoing political shift in Afghanistan under Amin; the Soviets were afraid that Amin would move Afghanistan's foreign policy from a pro-Soviet position to a pro-United States position. By early-to-mid December 1979, the Soviet leadership had established an alliance with Babrak Karmal and Assadullah Sarwari.|$|E

[...] While dismissing all the concerns on the safety of country's nuclear arsenal, Majid maintains to the fact: [...] "We are shouldering our responsibility with utmost vigilance and confidence.

This persuaded other government members to start a war against Soviet Russia. In January 1919, Estonians forced the Bolsheviks to retreat and by 24February 1919, the entire Estonian territory was {{under the control of the}} Provisional Government. In his speech at the 1919 Independence Day parade, he said: [...] "We have to <b>secure</b> <b>our</b> economy so we could become less dependent from our allies.

You see folks, while I didn't get a college degree in mathematics and writing, I majored in miracles. Mathematically impossible miracles. It is because I go back to that which helped crystallize in me a conservative viewpoint as a teenager when it wasn't easy or popular to be a Republican or a conservative in my hometown, because I do believe that America is about making choices, not simply echoing that of others. Let others join the [...] "Me, too" [...] crowd. But I didn't get where I am today and I didn't fight the battles in a state that, when I became its governor, was 90 percent Democrat, by simply echoing the voices of others. I did it by staking out a choice, stating that choice, making that choice and fighting for that choice, to believe that some things were right, some things were wrong, and it's better to be right and even to not win than it is to be wrong and to be a part of the crowd." ...|$|E
