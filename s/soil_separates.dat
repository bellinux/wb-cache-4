Clay particles are plate-shaped instead of spherical, allowing for an increased specific surface area.

50|$|The {{physical}} properties of soils, {{in order of}} decreasing importance, are texture, structure, density, porosity, consistency, temperature, colour and resistivity. Soil texture {{is determined by the}} relative proportion of the three kinds of soil mineral particles, called soil separates: sand, silt, and clay. At the next larger scale, soil structures called peds are created from the <b>soil</b> <b>separates</b> when iron oxides, carbonates, clay, silica and humus, coat particles and cause them to adhere into larger, relatively stable secondary structures. Soil density, particularly bulk density, is a measure of soil compaction. Soil porosity consists of the void part of the soil volume and is occupied by gases or water. Soil consistency is the ability of soil to stick together. Soil temperature and colour are self-defining. Resistivity refers to the resistance to conduction of electric currents and affects the rate of corrosion of metal and concrete structures. These properties may vary through the depth of a soil profile. Most of these properties determine the aeration of the soil and the ability of water to infiltrate and to be held within the soil.|$|E

5000|$|Both under-watering and over-watering can be {{detrimental}} to a houseplant. The best way {{to determine whether a}} plant needs water is to check the soil moisture. Feeling the soil is most reliable, since moisture meters are often inaccurate. Most potted plants must be allowed to reach an appropriate level of dryness in between waterings, though the amount of watering required varies greatly depending on the species. Proper soil moisture can range from still slightly moist on the soil surface to very dry to nearly the bottom of the pot. Watering a plant by the calendar is not recommended. If a plant does need to be watered, water should be slowly poured over the surface of the soil until it begins to drain out the bottom of the pot, ensuring complete saturation. However, sometimes the <b>soil</b> <b>separates</b> from the sides of the pot if it is allowed to dry out thoroughly, allowing the water to flow down the sides of the rootball and out the bottom too quickly to be absorbed and retained by the soil and roots. If this is the case, {{it may be necessary to}} set the plant in a shallow dish of water long enough for it to soak up enough water to moisten the rootball to its center. Repotting should eliminate this problem. Repotting should be done only when necessary, since the roots of a plant that is in an excessively large pot may rot.|$|E

30|$|The {{difference}} in the density and activity of earthworms in the different treatment plots compared to control might {{be responsible for the}} alteration in the percentage of <b>soil</b> <b>separates</b> viz. sand, silt and clay. Dramatic rise in earthworm densities coupled with remarkable increase in clay contents and decrease in sand contents in T 3 plots compared to T 0 and other treatment plots are noticeable. Curry (1998) reported a positive relationship between clay content and earthworm abundance and a negative relationship between earthworm population and sand content of the soil. This alteration in the amount of <b>soil</b> <b>separates</b> is possibly due to selective feeding, physical grinding by gizzard and redistribution of soil particles by means of earthworms casting activities (Edwards and Bohlen 1996). Thus it appears that earthworms have an important role in determining soil textural classes. Panigrahi et al.

Wastewater percolation tests were carried out through one soil column CA, in contact with soil surface and through another CB, closely above groundwater table. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the importance of soil columns CA and CB, in total coliforms and staphylococci retention during wastewater infiltration or groundwater recharge, in equatorial soils in Central African region. The results showed that, the fraction of total coliforms retained through soil column CA varied with respect to wastewater loads applied on top of soil column, from 69. 22 % to 99. 95 %, relative to the total coliforms concentration deposited on top. The fraction of total coliforms retained through CB varied with respect to wastewater loads applied, from 96. 98 to 99. 89 % relative to the total coliforms deposited on top. Through both soil columns, fractions of staphylococci retained was in the order of 99. 99 % relative to the total staphylococci concentration deposited on top. For the whole bacteriological analysis, the fractions of total coliforms retained seems to be greater through deeper soil column than that of upper soil column. The bacterial contaminants retained relative to their concentrations in wastewater poured on soil column surfaces, varied from 6. 17 log units to 9. 73 log units. An applied load of 100 ml seemed to lead to the bacterial pollutants transported through both soil columns studied. NH+ 4 was retained by fractions varying from 97. 37 to 98. 74 %. Concentrations of various contaminants found in groundwater would be a tiny part, relative to quantities deposited on soil surface. Bacterial retention potentials of <b>soil</b> column <b>separating</b> <b>soil</b> surface from groundwater table during wastewater percolation, varies along its transect.

40|$|This paper proposes {{homogenization}} {{scheme for}} estimating the effective thermal conductivity of fully saturated soils. This approach {{is based on}} the random checkerboard-like microstructure. Two modeling scales and two modeling approaches are distinguished and used, i. e. microscale and mesoscale and 1 -step and 2 -step homogenizations, respectively. The 2 -step homogenization involves sequential averaging procedure, i. e. first, at microscale, a mineralogical composition of soil skeleton is considered and averaging process results in estimation of the skeleton effective thermal conductivity, and then, at mesoscale, a random spatial packing of solid skeleton and pores via random checkerboard microstructure is modeled and leads to evaluation of the soil overall thermal conductivity. The 1 -step homogenization starts directly at the mesoscale and homogenization procedure yields evaluation of the overall soil thermal conductivity. At the mesoscale, the distinct nature of soil skeleton, as composed of <b>soil</b> <b>separates,</b> is considered and random variability of soil is modeled via enriched random checkerboard-like structure. Both approaches, i. e. 1 -step and 2 -step homogenizations, interrelate mineralogical composition with the soil texture characterized by the volume fractions of <b>soil</b> <b>separates,</b> i. e. sand, silt and clay. The probability density functions (PDFs) of thermal conductivity are assumed for each of the separates. The soil texture PDF of thermal conductivity is derived taking into consideration the aforementioned functions. Whenever the random checkerboard-like structure is used in averaging process, the Monte Carlo procedure is applied for estimation of homogenized thermal conductivity. Finally, the proposed methodology is tested against the laboratory data from our measurements as well as those available from literature...|$|E
