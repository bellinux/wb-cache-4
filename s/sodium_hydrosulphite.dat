5000|$|Vat dyes {{characteristically}} {{require a}} reducing agent to solubilize them. The most common reducing agent is sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4), which converts the dye to its [...] "leuco" [...] form that is soluble. Once {{attached to the}} fabric, the leuco dye is then oxidized to the insoluble state which is intensely colored. Chemical reactions such as oxidation, reduction, pH control are often necessary; even the dissolution process necessitates measuring out appropriate quantities of caustic soda and <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrosulphite</b> {{in order to achieve}} reduction. The dye is soluble only in its reduced (oxygen-free) form. The fiber is immersed repeatedly in this oxygen-free dyebath, then exposed to the air, whereupon the water-soluble reduced form changes color as oxygen turns it to the water-insoluble form. For these reasons, vat dyes are less suitable than fiber-reactive dyes for amateur use.|$|E

30|$|It can be {{explained}} in other words. Cotton is pure cellulose, a naturally occurring polymer. Chemically it is a “cellobiose” which belongs to carbohydrate polymer, containing hydroxyl groups. These negatively charged groups attract water molecules and make cotton absorbs water well. When cotton dyed with reactive dyes, some of these -OH groups are occupied, which slightly reduces absorbency. During the stripping process, cotton fiber releases {{the maximum number of}} hydroxyl groups which has been formed covalent bonds with the cellulose. This is due to the dye reduction reaction of <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrosulphite</b> and caustic soda on the cellulose. In addition, the stripping agent can also attack the crystalline region of cotton and as a result, there may also be chances of releasing the hydroxyl groups. Basically, hydroxyl groups are responsible for water absorbency. This is the reason behind the stripped fabric having more water absorbency as well as strength loss.|$|E

Polymer-like transformation of polyacrylonitrile was used to increase chemisorption properties.

It was found that nanometre size particles of nickel, cobalt and their alloys can be formed from metal ions bounded to fibre with following electroless deposition using either <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrosulphite</b> or sodium hypophosphite as a reducing agent.

40|$|Indigo is {{insoluble}} {{in water}} and most dyeing solvents. Hence, its use in textile coloration is achieved by alkaline reduction to a soluble leuco-compound and then applying this solution followed by oxidation. Printing with indigo on cotton commonly employs sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) as the alkali and <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrosulphite</b> (hydros) as the reducing agent. Caustic soda poses effluent disposal problems. Hydros rapidly loses potency by reacting with atmospheric oxygen during the printing / padding process.

The shades obtained using synthetic indigo were about 20 % darker than those obtained using natural indigo.

Reaction of PpL with TNM causes the modification of 1. 9 equiv. of tyrosine (Tyr(51) and Tyr(53)) and results in an approx. 140 -fold decrease in affinity for human IgG.
