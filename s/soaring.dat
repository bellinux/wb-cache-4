5|$|<b>Soaring</b> {{related to}} wind shear, also called dynamic <b>soaring,</b> is a {{technique}} used by <b>soaring</b> birds like albatrosses, who can maintain flight without wing flapping. If the wind shear is of sufficient magnitude, a bird can climb into the wind gradient, trading ground speed for height, while maintaining airspeed. By then turning downwind, and diving through the wind gradient, they can also gain energy. It has also been used by glider pilots on rare occasions.|$|E
5|$|In a competition, {{using the}} engine ends the <b>soaring</b> flight. Unpowered gliders are lighter and, {{as they do}} not need a safety margin for {{starting}} the engine, they can safely thermal at lower altitudes in weaker conditions. Consequently, pilots in unpowered gliders may complete competition flights when some powered competitors cannot. Conversely, motor glider pilots can start the engine if conditions will no longer support <b>soaring</b> flight, while unpowered gliders will have to land out, away from the home airfield, requiring retrieval by road using the glider's trailer.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Soar</b> Goose (Xiang-Yan or Xiangyan, 翔雁) {{is one of}} the {{fixed-wing}} UAV {{developed by}} SAC. Externally, <b>Soar</b> Goose is similar to a scaledown version of Guizhou <b>Soar</b> Dragon, adopting the same joined wing design. The biggest difference between <b>Soar</b> Dragon and <b>Soar</b> Goose besides size is that <b>Soar</b> Goose adopts a piston engine as opposed to the turbojet engine of <b>Soar</b> Dragon, and the two-blade propeller driven by a pusher engine is mounted at the rear end of empennage of the UAV. [...] This simple but reliable engine consumes very little fuel and thus enable <b>Soar</b> Goose to achieve long endurance. <b>Soar</b> Goose program first begun in August 2007 and design was completed within a month. By December 2007, the first prototype was completed and maiden flight was completed on May 2, 2008.

5|$|The {{technique}} of flight among procellariids depends on foraging methods. Compared {{to an average}} bird, all procellariids have a high aspect ratio (meaning their wings are long and narrow) and a heavy wing loading. Therefore, they must maintain a high speed {{in order to remain}} in the air. Most procellariids use two techniques to do this, namely, dynamic <b>soaring</b> and slope <b>soaring.</b> Dynamic <b>soaring</b> involves gliding across wave fronts, thus taking advantage of the vertical wind gradient and minimising the effort required to stay in the air. Slope <b>soaring</b> is more straightforward: the procellariid turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide back down to the sea. Most procellariids aid their flight by means of flap-glides, where bursts of flapping are followed by a period of gliding; the amount of flapping dependent on the strength of the wind and the choppiness of the water. Shearwaters and other larger petrels, which have lower aspect ratio, must make more use of flapping to remain airborne than gadfly petrels. Because of the high speeds required for flight, procellariids need to either run or face into a strong wind in order to take off.|$|E

40|$|This {{tutorial}} {{gives an}} overview of <b>Soar</b> as an architecture for developing agents as well as cognitive models. It covers the history of <b>Soar</b> contrasts it with other cognitive architectures, but emphasizes hands-on development where the attendees create <b>Soar</b> programs. Tutorial Description Although <b>Soar</b> has existed for over 20 years, it is still quite relevant for cognitive modeling as it supports immediate behavior, planning, and reflection. <b>Soar</b> has been recently extended to include episodic (Nuxoll & Laird, 2007) and semantic memories, as well as reinforcement learning (Nason & Laird, 2005), and an implementation of appraisal theory (Marinier & Laird 2004). This tutorial {{is meant to be}} a crash course in learning <b>Soar.</b> The tutorial begins with a background of the genesis of <b>Soar,</b> its original goals, and how those goals have changed over the years. We also cover the history of <b>Soar’s</b> development and the systems developed in <b>Soar</b> and the tasks on which they have been used. From there, the tutorial presents the Problem Space Computational Model (PSCM), the theoretical background for <b>Soar.</b> The remainder of the tutorial is hands-on, with the students writing their own programs. The tutorial emphasizes understanding how all of the components of <b>Soar</b> work together, but also introduces the students to the syntax and structure of the architecture (the memories and processes). Throughout the presentation of <b>Soar,</b> we compare and contrast it with other cognitive architectures, especially Act-R (Anderson 2007) and EPIC (Meyer & Kieras, 1997). In the morning, participants learn to run, modify, and debug small demonstration programs that illustrate the various parts of <b>Soar's</b> structure. They are introduced to <b>Soar’s</b> editing, debugging, and runtime tools. In the afternoon, we work on simple agents that interact with a dynamic simulated environment. The students will build their own complete agents that navigate and compete in a simple maze world. The <b>Soar</b> homepage is...|$|R

5|$|Seabirds {{have made}} {{numerous}} adaptations to living on and feeding in the sea. Wing morphology {{has been shaped}} by the niche an individual species or family has evolved, so that looking at a wing's shape and loading can tell a scientist about its life feeding behaviour. Longer wings and low wing loading are typical of more pelagic species, while diving species have shorter wings. Species such as the wandering albatross, which forage over huge areas of sea, have a reduced capacity for powered flight and are dependent on a type of gliding called dynamic <b>soaring</b> (where the wind deflected by waves provides lift) as well as slope <b>soaring.</b> Seabirds also almost always have webbed feet, to aid movement on the surface as well as assisting diving in some species. The Procellariiformes are unusual among birds in having {{a strong sense of}} smell, which is used to find widely distributed food in a vast ocean, and possibly to locate their colonies.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} brie y {{describes the}} Goal Dependency Set (GDS), which was introduced with <b>Soar</b> 8. There are three sections: {{a brief discussion}} of the motivation for the GDS, {{a discussion of the}} consequences of the GDS from a behavior developer/modeler's point of view, and some details on the implementation of the GDS, for anyone working at the kernel level. This document is by no means complete, but introduces the GDS in Soar-specic terms. Why the GDS was needed As a symbol system, <b>Soar</b> attempts to approximate the knowledge level but will necessarily always fall short [4]. We can informally think {{of the way in which}} <b>Soar</b> falls short of the knowledge level as its pe-culiar. " Those interested in using <b>Soar</b> to model human psychology would like <b>Soar's</b> -chology " to approximate human psychology. Those using <b>Soar</b> to create agent systems would like to make <b>Soar's</b> processing approximate the knowledge level as closely as possible. However, <b>Soar</b> 7 had a number of symbol-level " that appeared inconsistent with human psychology and that made building large-scale, knowledge-based systems in <b>Soar</b> more dicult than necessary.
