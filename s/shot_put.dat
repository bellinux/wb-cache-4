50|$|Vammalan Konepaja’s own foundry made it {{possible}} for the company to develop new cast iron products, from design right through to the finished product. The foundry helped Vammalan Konepaja make its mark on Finnish sporting history in the 1930s. In 1934 a contract was made between the Finnish Athletics Federation and Vammalan Konepaja, under which Vammalan Konepaja started to make the <b>shot</b> <b>puts</b> used by both men and women in competitions. The contract allowed the Federation’s trademark to be cast in the <b>shot</b> <b>puts.</b> The contract was signed on behalf of Vammalan Konepaja by entrepreneur Niilo Ranni; signing on behalf of the Athletics Federation was its then chairman, Urho Kekkonen, who would go on to become Finland’s eighth president. The manufacture of pumps for domestic wells also began in 1934. These pumps proved to be a much more important and innovative product for the company than <b>shot</b> <b>puts,</b> and served to make the company famous for decades to follow. There was much need for NIRA hand pumps after the Continuation War; farms were created in northern and eastern Finland for evacuees from Karjala, and these new farms needed water supplies.|$|R

Fonville's winning effort in the <b>shot</b> <b>put</b> was five feet better than that of the state champion. Later that summer, Charlie Fonville and Jessie Nimmons competed in the Detroit YMCA Track Championship as a two-man team for the St. Antoine YMCA; Fonville won the 100m, 200m, high jump, and <b>shot</b> <b>put.</b> Fonville and Nimmons won the 440yard relay, with each of them running 220yard legs.

Dane Edgar Aabye was at the Games as a journalist for the Politiken newspaper, but was recruited into the team to make up the numbers as one of the original entrants was injured.

40|$|<b>Shot</b> <b>putting</b> is an {{important}} component of track and field events and the throwing distance (s, m) is the greatest concern of coaches and athletes. There are mainly three major factors affecting throwing distance: the initial velocity (v, m/s), release angle (A, °) and release height (h, m) in shot push. So far, it is common to use the physical kinematics knowledge in the research of <b>shot</b> <b>putting,</b> but the release height’s impact on the throwing distance is rarely considered. By mathematical modeling and computer simulation, this article analyzes the relation between the three factors (v, A, h) with the throwing distance (s) and determine the best release angle with regard to different release velocity. In addition, the impact of release velocity and release angle on throwing scores is discussed. This article is of certain theoretical guiding significance for athletes and coaches in the selection, training and competition for athletes...|$|R
