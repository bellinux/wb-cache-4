40|$|Metalation {{has served}} well for over 80 {{years as a}} vehicle for {{transforming}} inert C[BOND]H bonds in organic compounds to reactive C[BOND]metal bonds. 1 Progress in metalation was accelerated greatly by the development of DoM (directed ortho-metalation), 2 pioneered by Snieckus, Beak, and others, a special type of lithiation (aromatic C[BOND]H to Cδ−[BOND]Liδ+) reliant on the high polarity of carbon–lithium bonds in organolithium reagents. Many other metals could not engage in metalation due to the lower polarity/lower reactivity of their corresponding carbon–metal bonds. However, this obstacle has now been cleared by the recognition that when part of a mixed-metal system or other multicomponent mixture, these metals (for example, magnesium, zinc, aluminum or manganese) can exhibit greatly enhanced metalating properties often superior in terms of functional-group compatibility or reaction conditions to that of lithium. Interest in these new “low polarity” metalating agents is widespread with coverage in fundamental chemistry journals, 3 process chemistry journals, 4 interdisciplinary science journals, 5 and in news items in scientific media. 6 Knochel’s turbo-Grignard reagents (e. g., (iPr) MgCl⋅LiCl) [*] 7 are examples that have been commercialized. A spectacular demonstration of the special reactivity of bimetallic bases came with the α-zincation of tetrahydrofuran (THF) by the <b>sodium</b> dialkyl(amido) <b>zincate</b> [(TMEDA) Na(μ-TMP) (μ-CH 2 SiMe 3) Zn(CH 2 SiMe 3) ] (TMEDA=N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine; TMP= 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine) to produce [(TMEDA) Na(μ-TMP) (μ-OC 4 H 7) Zn(CH 2 SiMe 3) ]. 5 Conventional metalation of THF invariably initiates decomposition by ring opening, 8 but in this low-polarity zincation the 5 -atom ring of the sensitive α-deprotonated THF anion remains intact. However, this reaction is extremely slow (best yield was 52. 7 [*]% after 2  weeks) and requires a massive stoichiometric excess of the cyclic ether (i. e., carried out in neat THF solvent). Here we report a vastly superior methodology to the cyclic THF α-anion, mediated by a lithium aluminate base with a higher amido content than the alkyl-rich zincate reagent.

The all-alkyl monomeric <b>sodium</b> <b>zincate</b> (PMEDTA) ·Na(μ-CH 2 SiMe 3) ZntBu 2 2, is prepared by combining an equimolar quantity of tBu 2 Zn, nBuNa and PMDETA (N,N,N′,N′′,N′′-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine) ]. A similar approach {{was used to}} prepare and isolate the unusual dimeric zincate [(PMEDTA) ·Na(μ-nBu) ZntBu 2] 2 3. When an equimolar mixture of nBuNa, tBu 2 Zn and TMP(H) (2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine) are combined in hexane, the hetero-tri-leptic TMP(H) -solvated zincate (TMPH) Na(μ-TMP) (μ-nBu) ZntBu 4 was forthcoming. Complex 4 can also be prepared using a rational approach [i. e., utilising two molar equivalents of TMP(H) ]. When TMEDA is reacted with an equimolar mixture of nBuNa, tBu 2 Zn and TMP(H), the monomeric <b>sodium</b> <b>zincate</b> (TMEDA) Na(μ-TMP) (μ-nBu) ZntBu 5 was obtained – this complex is structurally similar to the synthetically useful relation TMEDA) ·Na(μ-TMP) (μ-tBu) Zn(tBu) 1. By changing the sodium reagent used in the synthesis of 5, {{it was possible to}} prepare (TMEDA) Na(μ-TMP) (μ-Me 3 SiCH 2) ZntBu 6. By reacting 5 with cis-DMP(H) (cis- 2, 6 -dimethylpiperidine), the zincate could thermodynamically function as a amide base, to give the transamination product (TMEDA) Na(μ-cis-DMP) (μ-nBu) ZntBu 7, although no crystals could be grown. However, when HMDS(H) (1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3 -hexamethyldisilazane) or PEA(H) [(+) -bis[(R) - 1 -phenylethyl]amine] is reacted with 5, crystalline (TMEDA) Na(μ-HMDS) (μ-nBu) ZntBu 8 or (TMEDA) Na(μ-PEA) (μ-nBu) ZntBu 9 are isolated respectively.

The third complex, containing two cis-DMP ligands, is the alkyl-bisamido <b>sodium</b> <b>zincate</b> [(TMEDA) ·NaZn(cis-DMP) 2 (tBu) ] 3. Complex 3 is prepared from 2 via a disproportionation reaction where the by-product is [(TMEDA) ·NaZn(tBu) 3].

Likewise, the separated {{pairing of}} Li(TMP) and (TMP) AliBu 2 {{in the presence}} of THF can mono- or dimetalate ferrocene in a synergistic two-step lithiation/trans-metal-trapping protocol to give THF·Li(μ-TMP) [μ-(C 5 H 4) Fe(C 5 H 5) ]Al(iBu) 2 (4) or [THF·Li(μ-TMP) Al(iBu) 2] 2 (C 5 H 4) 2 Fe (5).

Tetrametalation seems to be inhibited by the in situ generation of TMP(H) via amido basicity, which then acts as a Lewis donor toward lithium, preventing inverse-crown formation and preferentially forming the Lewis acid–Lewis base adduct [TMP(H) ·Li(μ-TMP) Al(iBu) 2] 2 (C 5 H 4) 2 Fe (6).

Structural characterization by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique confirmed incorporation of aluminum in ZnO lattice. The c-axis orientation was significantly enhanced due to Al incorporation which was revealed from marked increase of (002) peak intensity compared to other peaks of hexagonal ZnO.

40|$|There {{has been}} a recent upsurge of {{activity}} {{in the study of}} alkali metal zincate reagents due to their often special reactivity/selectivity in, for example, deprotonative metalation and nucleophilic addition reactions. Heteroleptic dialkylamidozincates, [M+Zn(R) 2 (NR' 2) -], usually transfer selectivity of the amide ligand to electrophiles. Here, in contrast, it is reported that the <b>sodium</b> <b>zincate</b> [TMEDA·Na(-tBu) (-TMP) Zn(tBu) ] reacts as an alkylating agent toward the diaryl ketone benzophenone (Ph 2 C=O), selectively adding one of its tBu ligands to the para-C atom of one of the Ph rings. The reaction can be carried out at room temperature, which is a decided advantage over lithium reagents as these are generally utilized at subambient temperatures. The stabilizing effect of the bimetallic (Na, Zn) cationic residue of the starting zincate reagent in coordinating to the dearomatized enolate anion of the 1, 6 -addition adduct allows the adduct to be isolated in a pure crystalline form. An X-ray crystallographic study of the adduct reveals a molecular structure based on a near-planar, four-element (NaOZnN) ring with a TMP-N and an enolato-O bridge. The Na and Zn atoms also carry terminal TMEDA (N,N'-attached) and tBu (C-attached) ligands, respectively.

Interestingly, the methyl group of toluene has been left untouched by the mixed-metal base. The crystal structures of both regioisomers have been elucidated by using X-ray crystallography, which revealed a common motif, in which zinc lies in the same plane as the tolyl ring and binds strongly to the carbon that has experienced the deprotonation, leading to a covalent s bond; whereas sodium adopts a perpendicular disposition, p-engaging with the aromatic ring. DFT studies of the reaction of 1 with toluene showed that of the four possible regioisomers, the experimentally observed meta and para ones are the most thermodynamically preferred products due {{to a large extent}} to the combined (synergic) effect of the zinc and sodium and the different way in which each metal binds to the tolyl anion. In contrast, the more straightforward benzyl-based zincate [(tmeda) 2 NaACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH 2 Ph) ZnACHTUNGTRENUNG(tBu) 2] (3) is obtained through an indirect route, in which toluene is first laterally metallated by monometallic butylsodium to afford benzylsodium, which then forms a mixed-metal compound by co-complexation with tBu 2 Zn.

Furthermore, the generation of anionic NHC fragments enables dual coordination through their normal (C 2) and abnormal (C 4) positions to the bimetallic system, stabilising the kinetic AMMZn intermediates which normally go undetected and provides new mechanistic insights in to how these mixed-metal reagents operate. In stark contrast to this bimetallic approach when NHC-complex 3 is reacted with a more conventional single-metal base such as tBuLi, the deprotonation of the coordinated carbene is inhibited, favouring instead, co-complexation to give NHC-stabilised [IPr·LiZntBu 3] (5). Showing the potential of 2 to act as a transfer agent of its anionic NHC unit to transition metal complexes, this intermediate reacts with two molar equivalents of [ClAu(PPh 3) ] to afford the novel digold species [ClAu:C{[N(2, 6 -iPr 2 C 6 H 3) ] 2 CHCAu(PPh 3) }] (6) resulting from an unprecedented double transmetallation reaction which involves the simultaneous exchange of both cationic (Na+) and neutral (ZntBu 2) entities on the NHC framework...|$|E

Discussion of the structures of 1 - 5 focuses on the interplay of sigma-bonding and pi-bonding between the pyrrolyl ligands and the metal centres. Revealingly, the zinc-free sodiopyrrole complex [{(PMDETA) center dot Na(NC 4 H 4) }(2) ] 6, made and characterised for comparison, shows that on its own sodium prefers the former type of bonding, but is forced to switch to the latter type when combined with the stronger Lewis acid zinc in the zincate compositions.
