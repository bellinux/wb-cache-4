Using the optimized medium, the constructed microbial consortium was cultured in a large scale through batch and fed-batch culture method. A liquid microbial agent was made using the consortium cells produced in a large scale and it was evaluated for the removal of organic compounds. Furthermore, a powered microbial agent was also developed through the formulation process after freeze-drying of the consortium cells. The formulated microbial agent was evaluated for the removal of organic compounds under various environmental conditions and found to work an effective role as a bioremediation agent...|$|E

A total of 225 species of intertidal benthos from <b>shore</b> <b>wetlands</b> in Meizhou Bay was reported. Polychaetes, Molluscs and Crustaceans accounted for 88 % of all species. The number of benthic species differed between transects and was greater in spring than autumn. Average biomass and density were 22. 91 g/m 2 and 388 inds. /m 2, respectively.

5000|$|The {{breeding}} habitats {{are most}} commonly alkali lake <b>shores,</b> <b>wetlands,</b> salt marshes, and coastland, which is fitting {{with the results}} of a study that investigated what makes an environment suitable for a breeding habitat for the Kentish plover. By analysing 4 variables of all known nests, the study found that plovers prefer to nest in areas of low elevation, low vegetation, high moisture and places far away from human activity and settlements,. There have been observations of parents moving their chicks from poor food areas to better food areas, with chicks subsequently growing stronger in the high food areas. This suggests that parents strategically move their chicks and change habitats. Moving young has benefits: protection from predators, obtaining more food, avoiding competition for food and space, avoiding potential infanticide due to competition, and avoiding territory defences from others. However, this is a trade-off as there are also costs to moving young: moving expends a lot of energy, especially in young, therefore chick growth may be stunted as energy is used on movement rather than growth, the chance of mortality due to starvation or predation increases whilst moving through open areas and the area of high food may have a lot of predators in it already. Overall, chick growth and brood survival benefit from moving to a higher food area, therefore increasing reproductive success of parents, hence why the parents move their chicks. The study also found that the larger and heavier females were more likely to move chicks, perhaps because they could defend their chicks from neighbouring parents ...|$|R

This study proves that the scattered and isolated groups of a nocturnal bird like Stone Curlew are compelled to retire in full view of one and all during daytime and hence are immensely vulnerable.

The sediments with rich plant fossil assemblages, which correspond to lacustrine diatomitic deposits, contain large numbers of plant remains, mainly leaf compressions and impressions. These assemblages are well preserved, a consequence of the rapid accumulation of plant remains in the sediments of the basin's ancient lake, and the often close proximity of its <b>shores</b> to <b>wetland</b> and upland vegetation. This paper provides a comprehensive taxonomic and nomenclatural review of the historic and new collections of late Miocene macroflora for the La Cerdanya Basin. Examination of the newer materials allowed emendments to be made to the diagnoses ofAbies saportana, Acer pyrenakum,Alnus occidentalis, Quercus hispanka and Tilia vidali provided by REROLLE for the basin {{at the end of the}} 19 th century. In addition, 24 species of vascular plants are identified for the basin for the first time, including one horsetail, three conifers, 19 arboreal or bushy dicotyledonous angiosperms, and one monocotyledonous angiosperm.

40|$|Evapotranspiration (ET) is an {{important}} component of the wetland water budget. Water level declines in Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, have caused concerns, especially during low water levels. However, how wetland ET and its partitioning respond to abnormally low water levels is unclear. In this study, wetland ET was estimated with MODIS data and meteorological data. The wetland ET partitioning and its relationship with abnormally low water levels were analyzed for 2000 – 2013. The results showed that the water evaporation rate (Ewater) was larger than the land ET rate (ETland); the ETland/Ewater ranged from 0. 77 to 0. 99. When the water level was below 12. 8 [*]m, the ET partition ratio was larger than 1, which indicates that wetland ET comes from land surface ET more than water evaporation. The negative standardized water level index (SWI) was used to represent an abnormally low water level in the wetland. Although the monthly wetland ET decreased as the negative SWI decreased, ETland was higher than the average under negative SWI conditions from September to December, when the water level decreased. The abnormally low water level induced more water loss from the land surface, especially when the water level decreased, which reduced the available water resources along the <b>wetland</b> <b>shore...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{improved}} empirical {{understanding of}} silt facies in Holocene coastal sequences provided by such as diatom, foraminifera, ostracode and testate amoebae analysis, combined with insights from quantitative stratigraphic and hydraulic simulations, {{has led to}} an inclusive, integrated model for the palaeogeomorphology, stratigraphy, lithofacies and biofacies of northwest European Holocene coastal lowlands in relation to sea-level behaviour. The model covers two general circumstances and is empirically supported by a range of field studies in the Holocene deposits of a number of British estuaries, particularly, the Severn. Where deposition was continuous over periods of centuries to millennia, and sea level fluctuated about a rising trend, the succession consists of repeated cycles of silt and peat lithofacies and biofacies in which series of transgressive overlaps (submergence sequences) alternate with series of regressive overlaps (emergence sequences) in association with the waxing and waning of tidal creek networks. Environmental and sea-level change are closely coupled, and equilibrium and secular pattern is of the kind represented ideally by a closed limit cycle. In the second circumstance, characteristic of unstable <b>wetland</b> <b>shores</b> and generally affecting smaller areas, coastal erosion ensures that episodes of deposition in the high intertidal zone last {{no more than a few}} centuries. The typical response is a series of regressive overlaps (emergence sequence) in erosively based high mudflat and salt-marsh silts that record, commonly as annual banding, exceptionally high deposition rates and a state of strong disequilibrium. Environmental change, including creek development, and sea-level movement are uncoupled. Only if deposition proceeds for a sufficiently long period, so that marshes mature, are equilibrium and close coupling regained. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The current study {{focuses on the}} vascular plants of Callahan Mine in Brooksville, ME, USA, a Superfund site contaminated with Cu, Zn, Pb, and other pollutants. One hundred and fifty-five taxa belonging to 50 families were identified, with the Asteraceae (21 %), Poaceae (11 %), and Rosaceae (9 %) as the most species-rich families. Ninety-six species encountered at the Mine were native to North America (62 %), including 11 taxa (7 %) with rarity status {{in at least one}} New England state. Fifty-one species were non-native (33 %), including nine taxa (6 %) considered invasive in at least one New England state. We characterized how the plant community changed across different habitats at the Mine, from disturbed and exposed (waste rock piles, tailings pond) to inundated and relatively undisturbed (<b>wetland,</b> <b>shore),</b> and documented concurrent shifts in the ionic content of the soils across the habitats. We found substantial differences in both the plant community and soil chemical features among habitats.

The first principal component axis of the 21 soil variables was significantly predicted by the ordination of the plant community, indicating a gradient of increasing organic matter, Fe, Mg, Mn, total N, Na, and K roughly parallel to the gradient of increasing wetland vegetation.
