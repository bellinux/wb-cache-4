40|$|Three plunge {{grinding}} control methods are discussed, {{and it is}} shown in control engineering terms that the process is one of motion control and that {{the differences between the}} various control methods lie in the control algorithms implemented in software using a common hardware system. A new control method is proposed for an improvement in grinding efficiency and is described as the optimum size and roundness adaptive control method. An accurate description of the control actions is provided, and the adaptive algorithm used by the proposed method also enables a low-cost computer system to be used. A case study of the grinding process based on a simulation is presented to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed control method. The experimental results for validating the proposed control method will be the subject of a separate publication.

For the case without flow control we set the <b>stop</b> <b>limit</b> to 25 [*]Mbit per flow which corresponds to about 8 [*] seconds of data for an MS.

The impact of flow control is rather limited in this scenario since the BSs transmit data to the RSs only in 38 % of the frames and RSs are only present in every second sector.

40|$|Following on a {{preceding}} {{paper of}} the same title [1], {{and the establishment of}} the dependence of the wind-pump performance on the wind-pump’s Froude number,, an analytical analysis of the wind-pump’s design parameters is further developed in this work. The result was the formulation of the system criteria that continuously match the load with the varying wind speed and water head. This led to a design procedure that entails variation of the pump stroke, the rotational speed-ratio or the turbine’s pitch angle to sustain a continuous peak performance. The stroke and speed-ratio variations are such that any of them is continuously proportional to the square of the wind-pump’s Froude number. The pitch-angle variation technique requires an inverse relation between the design torquecoefficient and the square of Froude number. The suggested power maximization techniques lead to the continuous operation of the turbine at its maximum power-coefficient point, as long as the operational Froude number is above its <b>stop</b> <b>limit.</b> This paper had been presented for promotion at the university of Khartoum.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a newly developed safety concept for application of robotic walking simulators {{based on the}} principle of programmable footplates in gait rehabilitation. Unlike robotic hand devices or exoskeleton robots for gait training on treadmills, which can be built relatively lightweight and require only small drives which can hardly do harm to the patient, a programmable footplate walking simulator with permanent foot fixture essentially needs to have powerful drives in order to carry and move the full body weight of the patient. The developed safety concept comprises several redundant algorithms and devices in the real-time robot control software, electrical emergency stop circuitry and machine mechanics. The mechanical core is a machine design offering maximum passive security by covering all moving parts (i. e. robot drives and linkages) and a newly developed foot safety release binding, which is mounted on each footplate. The release binding allows a safe re lease from the footplate in all directions in any degree of freedom in the sagittal plane. It is combined with an ankle goniometer which is equipped with adjustable emergency <b>stop</b> <b>limit</b> switches, thus ensuring that the allowed ankle range-of-motion is not exceeded...|$|E

AimCompare the frequency of advanced adenomas (AA) in colonoscopy between asymptomatic subjects with FIT+ vs. symptomatic patients. Evaluate the level of bleeding of AA. Material and methodologyCross-sectional, observational study of 2829 consecutive patientes referred for colonoscopy. We collected clinic-demographic information, AA (size, topography, and histology) and FIT quantification. We included 2829 subjects who underwent colonoscopy. Statisticsχ 2, Student's t-tests (0. 05), one-way ANOVA and ANCOVA were performed for adjusted contrasts among lesions, gender, positive left colonic findings and age. ResultsGlobal rate of AA was 7. 2 %. Detection of AA was higher in average-risk asymptomatic subjects than in symptomatic (8. 9 vs. 4. 35 %); no differences in age, sex or site of lesion was find. Group 1 : (n= 902). 105 AA (alone: 80. 2 %; ≤ 9 mm: 27. 2 %; 10 – 15 mm: 62. 9 % and ≥ 16 mm: 9. 9 %) were detected in 81 patients (females: 38. 2 %; mean age: 64. 1 ± 8. 4 years).

Sports Exerc., Vol. 24, No. 2, pp. 184 - 188, 1992. The purpose of this project was to describe the injury experiences of athletes with disabilities. A cross-disability instrument was developed to measure variables of interest. A retrospective survey was administered to 426 athletes who participated at the 1989 national competition of the National Wheelchair Athletic Association (NWAA), United States Association for Blind Athletes (USABA), and the United States Cerebral Palsy Athletic Association (USCPAA). The definition of injury was any trauma to the participant that occurred during any practice, training, or competition session that caused the athlete to <b>stop,</b> <b>limit,</b> or modify participation for 1 d or more. Thirty-two percent (N = 137) of the total respondents reported at least one time-loss injury. By organization, 26 % of the total injuries were from the NWAA and 37 % were from the USABA and USCPAA, respectively. The shoulder and arm/elbow accounted for 57 % of the total NWAA injuries. Fifty-three percent of the injuries to the USABA athlete were to the lower extremity. Injuries to the USCPAA athlete were distributed among four body locations, knee (21 %), shoulder (16 %), forearm/wrist (16 %), and leg/ankle (15 %). The athlete with a disability demonstrated approximately the same percentage of injury as the athlete without a disability in similar sport activities.
