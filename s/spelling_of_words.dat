25|$|The William J. Benson {{contention}} is essentially that the legislatures of various states passed ratifying resolutions {{in which the}} quoted text of the Amendment differed from the text proposed by Congress in terms of capitalization, <b>spelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>words,</b> or punctuation marks (e.g. semi-colons instead of commas), and that these differences made the ratification invalid. Benson makes other assertions including claims that one or more states rejected the Amendment and that the state or states were falsely reported as having ratified the Amendment. As explained below, the Benson arguments have been rejected in every court case {{where they have been}} raised, and were explicitly ruled to be fraudulent in 2007.|$|E

2500|$|Nasalization is much {{common in}} many BP dialects and is {{especially}} noticeable in vowels before [...] or [...] before by a vowel. For the same reason, open vowels (which are not normally under nasalization in Portuguese) cannot occur before [...] or [...] in BP, but can in EP. That sometimes affects the <b>spelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>words.</b> For example, harmónico [...] "harmonic" [...] is harmônico [...] in BP.

2500|$|The only {{descendants}} of the Israelites who have preserved Hebrew texts are the Jews and the Samaritans, the latter of whom there {{are but a few}} hundred left. Both the Samaritan religion and the indigenous Samaritan language, which today is used only liturgically, differ somewhat from their Jewish counterparts, though the difference between the language varieties is only dialectal. The canon of the Samaritans consists solely of a version of the Pentateuch. It is slightly different from the Jewish Masoretic version. Most are minor variations in the <b>spelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> or grammatical constructions, but others involve significant semantic changes, such as the uniquely Samaritan commandment to construct an altar on Mount Gerizim. Remarkably, it is to this day written in a script which developed from the paleo-Hebrew script (namely the Samaritan script), whereas the common [...] "Hebrew script" [...] is in fact a stylized version of the Aramaic script, not of the paleo-Hebrew script.|$|E
