25|$|The VOC {{required}} {{ships to}} utilise the Brouwer Route to cross from the Cape to Batavia, enjoying the prevailing westerlies by travelling eastwards until turning north. Turning north too late from a miscalculation in the longitude risked being wrecked {{on the coast}} or reefs of Australia. However, wishing to call into Western Australia, skipper Jan Steyns ignored The Company's directorate and protests from his <b>steersman</b> and headed ENE.|$|E
25|$|On 28 March 1658, while {{searching for}} the 68 {{survivors}} of {{the wreck of the}} Vergulde Draeck along the lower central west coast of Western Australia, Upper <b>Steersman</b> Abraham Leeman and his boat crew of 13 from the Waeckende Boey were inexplicably abandoned by the skipper, Samuel Volkersen of that ship. They were then about 180km north of present-day Perth. Their boat was in poor condition, they had no water, just a few pounds of flour contaminated by seawater, and some rashers of bacon.|$|E

60|$|While {{this was}} going on, the {{principal}} guides and <b>steersmen</b> crowded round our three travellers, and plied them with questions; for it was so unusual to meet with strangers in that far-off wilderness, that a chance meeting of this kind was regarded as quite an important event.|$|R
50|$|The fishermen, {{seizing the}} {{opportunity}} to retaliate, returned and attacked. In the ensuing brawl, one of the King’s <b>steersmen</b> was killed and Kamehameha himself received {{a blow to the}} head that was so hard that it splintered the man’s weapon - a solid koa canoe paddle. The two Puna men escaped.|$|R
25|$|At special festivals, {{especially}} the Duanwu Festival, dragon boat races {{are an important}} part of festivities. Typically, these are boats paddled by a team of up to 20 paddlers with a drummer and <b>steersman.</b> The boats have a carved dragon as the head and tail of the boat. Dragon boat racing is also an important part of celebrations outside of China, such as at Chinese New Year. A similar racing is popular in India in the state of Kerala called Vallamkali and there are records on Chinese traders visiting the seashores of Kerala centuries back (Ibn Batuta).|$|E
25|$|Bessemer, {{a severe}} {{seasickness}} sufferer, devised in 1868 {{the idea of}} a ship whose passenger cabin - the Saloon - would be suspended on gimbals and kept horizontal mechanically to isolate the occupants from the ship's motion: an idea he patented in December 1869. After successful trials with a model, the levelling achieved by hydraulics controlled by a <b>steersman</b> watching a spirit level, Bessemer set up a limited joint stock company, the Saloon Ship Company, to run steamships between England and France. This gained £250,000 capital, financing the construction of a ship, the SS Bessemer, with the naval constructor Edward James Reed as chief designer.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} September Spitfire {{detained}} the American merchantman Robust, on {{passage from}} Baltimore to Amsterdam, off the Eddystone. Kean put a mate and six men on board as a prize crew and sent her to Plymouth. On the way, while three men were aloft trimming the sails, two in the hold stowing the cable tier, one at the helm, and the prize-master having breakfast, the Americans, armed with pistols, seized the <b>steersman</b> and the prize master. The Americans threatened to shoot the men aloft and below if the prize crew did not give up the ship. The Americans put the prize crew into a boat, and after a long pull the seven men reached Salcombe. Robust resumed her voyage, reaching Amsterdam.|$|E
50|$|Religious ceremonies {{are still}} {{conducted}} aboard barges in the Royal Barge Procession of Thailand. The royal barge is rowed by fifty oarsmen, steered by two <b>steersmen,</b> and commanded by two officers. The crew is rounded {{out by a}} flagman, a chantman, and a signalman. Bangkok has a museum devoted entirely to royal barges.|$|R
5000|$|Since 1997, {{operation}} of the barges have been under regulations by the U.S. Coast Guard (for example, <b>steersmen</b> are required to obtain a Master Mariner's license) and, if reopened, would face regulations imposed in 2009 on its sister operation on the Lehigh Canal in Easton, PA by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for crew members in [...] "sensitive shipboard and dockside locations".|$|R
2500|$|There is no {{evidence}} to suggest that this boat has ever been fitted with a mast or sail of any kind. The major means of propulsion were either paddles or long poles, while steering was likely to have been done by an oar. Judging from the size of the boat, there were probably nine pairs of paddlers, 18 men in total, and two <b>steersmen.</b> Paddlers would most likely paddle from a standing position, while <b>steersmen</b> would stand on the stern platform. With this arrangement, an important function of the boat would have been to demonstrate the power and high status of the group to their neighbours. Another function of the boat might have been simply to transport cargoes such as iron ore, rocks, timber, grain or meat, among others, with a maximum load as high as [...] In this case, the arrangement and number of paddlers may have been adjusted to take account of the cargo carried.|$|R
25|$|When a 8m (26ft) long whale was sighted, chalupas (chaloupes in French, {{and later}} shallops in English) were sent out, each manned by a <b>steersman,</b> five oarsmen, and a harpooner. The whale was harpooned {{and forced to}} tow a wooden drogue or drag, which was used to tire the whale. Once exhausted, the whale was lanced and killed. If {{darkness}} fell upon the crews before they returned, those ashore would light signal fires at the vigías to guild {{them back to the}} station. The whales were brought alongside a wharf or cutting stage, where they were flensed. The blubber was tried out, cooled, and poured into barricas – casks of oak that held 55 gallons of oil. These casks were towed out to the ship by a boat, where they were stored in the hold. When a full cargo had been obtained, either during the right whale season, or, more often during the later bowhead season, many of the larger ships sailed to Pasaia to discharge their cargoes; they also fitted out of the same port. Pasaia was preferred by both French and Spanish Basques because of its deep-water entrance and the excellent shelter it provided from Biscay storms.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of 28 April 1656 a Dutch vessel {{belonging}} to the Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC), the Vergulde Draeck, struck a reef off Ledge Point on the central west coast of Western Australia, about 5 kilometres from shore, and approximately 90 kilometres north of where Perth now stands. At least 75 individuals made it to shore, where they camped. Seven men departed in a boat, making for Batavia, now known as Jakarta, at the western end of Java. They arrived there on 7 June 1656 and raised the alarm. A number of ships were then dispatched over the following two years to search for the survivors who had remained behind, but an incorrect latitude meant the searches focused on the wrong area. The original campsite, by then abandoned, was not found until 26 February 1658, by a shore party led by Upper <b>Steersman</b> Abraham Leeman. There has been much speculation as to the fate of the 68, who may have ended up east of Geraldton, approximately 350 kilometres to the north, ultimately integrating with the local Aboriginal population. Two stone arrangements, the Ring of Stones, found to the north in modern times may have been markers left by the 68 survivors. Archaeological investigations are continuing in an endeavour to locate the original campsite.|$|E

60|$|At {{first the}} two boats shot {{backwards}} and forwards across the stream {{in a very}} erratic way, but after an hour's practice the <b>steersmen</b> found the amount of force required.

There was quite a sea running, though the trade wind was blowing light. The chiefs rested from their paddles, save for the <b>steersmen</b> who kept the canoes bow-on to the wind and swell. And, ere they {{proceeded}} further in the matter, they opened more coconuts and drank.|$|R
60|$|The {{word was}} cried from boat to boat, {{and we could}} see the men {{pointing}} upwards and laughing.

We gained the still pools below, the sun came out once more and smiled on the landscape, and the spirits of the men, reviving, burst all bounds.|$|R
500|$|Some {{contemporary}} scholars call Pericles a populist, a demagogue and a hawk, {{while other}} scholars admire his charismatic leadership. According to Plutarch, after assuming {{the leadership of}} Athens, [...] "he {{was no longer the}} same man as before, nor alike submissive to the people and ready to yield and give in to the desires of the multitude as a <b>steersman</b> to the breezes". It is told that when his political opponent, Thucydides, was asked by Sparta's king, Archidamus, whether he or Pericles was the better fighter, Thucydides answered without any hesitation that Pericles was better, because even when he was defeated, he managed to convince the audience that he had won. In matters of character, Pericles was above reproach {{in the eyes of the}} ancient historians, since [...] "he kept himself untainted by corruption, although he was not altogether indifferent to money-making".|$|E
2500|$|In {{getting under}} way, Governor Moore was fouled by {{and ran into}} the Confederate tug Belle Algerine, sinking her. [...] Attacking the Union fleet, she found USS Varuna ahead {{of the rest of the}} fleet. A long chase ensued, both ships firing on each other as Governor Moore pursued the Federal vessel. Despite losing a large part of her crew during the chase, she was {{eventually}} able to ram Varuna. The cottonclad ram Stonewall Jackson, of the River Defense Fleet also managed to ram. Varuna was able to reach shallow water near the bank before she sank, the only vessel lost from the attacking fleet. Captain Beverley Kennon of Governor Moore would have continued the fight, but his <b>steersman</b> had had enough and drove the ship ashore. Kennon, apparently realizing that his <b>steersman</b> was correct and that the ship was unable to do any more, ordered her abandoned and set afire.|$|E

6000|$|Choosing the men {{for this}} long and arduous voyage was an {{interesting}} scene. L'Esperance, the old guide, who had many a day guided this brigade through the lakes and rivers of the interior, made his appearance at the fort {{a day or two}} before the time fixed for starting; and at his heels followed a large band of wild, careless, happy-looking half-breeds. Having collected in front of the office door, Mr McKenny went out with a book and pencil in his hand, and told L'Esperance to begin. The guide went a little apart from the rest, accompanied by the <b>steersmen</b> of the boats (seven or eight in number), and then, scanning the group of dark athletic men who stood smiling before him, called out, [...] "Pierre!" [...] A tall, Herculean man answered to the call, and, stepping out from among the rest, stood beside his friend the guide. After this one of the <b>steersmen</b> chose another man; and so on, till the crews of all the boats were completed. Their names were then marked down in a book, and they all proceeded to the trading-room, for the purpose of taking [...] "advances," [...] in the shape of shirts, trousers, bonnets, caps, tobacco, knives, capotes, and all the other things necessary for a long, rough journey.|$|R

2500|$|In this work, which furnishes a {{valuable}} if prejudiced description {{of life in}} 5th century Gaul, Salvian deals with the same problem that had moved the eloquence of Augustine and Orosius: why were these miseries falling on the empire? Could it be, as the pagans said, because the age had forsaken its old gods? Or was it, as the semi-pagan creed of some Christians taught, that God did not constantly overrule the world he had created (i. 1)? With the former Salvian will not argue (iii. 1). To the latter he replies by asserting that [...] "just as the navigating <b>steersman</b> never loses the helm, so does God never remove his care from the world".

2500|$|The Straight Course {{runs from}} the {{upstream}} end of Temple Island to a point opposite the upstream end of the Phyllis Court. It is [...] wide. The Straight Course has generally addressed the problems of unfairness: for example, between 1975 and 1984, 50.52% of races were won on Bucks and 49.31% on Berks (with the remainder dead heats). However, when a strong stream is flowing, the Berks station enjoys considerable shelter from the stream, particularly in the last ¼ mile. Conversely, {{when there is a}} strong south-westerly wind it is better to be on the Bucks station because it is more sheltered from the wind. The course is now piled and boomed along its entire length, except for crossing points. The booms can present a hazard for the inexperienced coxswain or <b>steersman.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{long-term}} linguistic {{effect of}} the Viking settlements in England was threefold: over a thousand Old Norse words eventually became part of Standard English; numerous places in the East and North-east of England have Danish names, and many English personal names are of Scandinavian origin. Scandinavian words that entered the English language included landing, score, beck, fellow, take, busting and <b>steersman.</b> The vast majority of loan words did not appear in documents until the early 12th century; these included many modern words which used sk- sounds, such as skirt, sky, and skin; other words appearing in written sources at this time included again, awkward, birth, cake, dregs, fog, freckles, gasp, law, moss, neck, ransack, root, scowl, sister, seat, sly, smile, want, weak and window from Old Norse meaning [...] "wind-eye". Some of the words that came into use {{are among the most}} common in English, such as to go, to come, to sit, to listen, to eat, both, same, get and give. The system of personal pronouns was affected, with they, them and their replacing the earlier forms. Old Norse influenced the verb to be; the replacement of sindon by are is almost certainly Scandinavian in origin, as is the third-person-singular ending -s in the present tense of verbs.|$|E

Thus a moment, then a second word, the premonitory crack of a whip {{in the darkness of the}} gangway, and the tomtom began to beat the time.

25|$|The race {{begins at}} the {{downstream}} end of Temple Island, where the crews attach {{to a pair of}} pontoons. The race umpire will then call out the names of the two crews and start them when they are both straight and ready. Each crew is assigned to row on either the 'Bucks' (Buckinghamshire) or 'Berks' (Berkshire) side of the race course. The coxswains or <b>steersmen</b> are expected to keep their crew on the allocated side of the course at all times during the race, else they risk disqualification.
