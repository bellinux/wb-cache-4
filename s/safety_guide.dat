50|$|Radiation {{monitoring}} {{involves the}} measurement of radiation dose or radionuclide contamination for reasons related to the assessment or control of exposure to ionizing radiation or radioactive substances, and {{the interpretation of the}} results. The ‘measurement’ of dose often means {{the measurement of}} a dose equivalent quantity as a proxy (i.e. substitute) for a dose quantity that cannot be measured directly. Also, sampling may be involved as a preliminary step to measurement of the content of radionuclides in environmental media. The methodological and technical details of the design and operation of monitoring programmes and systems for different radionuclides, environmental media and types of facility are given in IAEA <b>Safety</b> <b>Guide</b> RS-G-1.8 and in IAEA Safety Report No. 64.|$|E

Due to the difficulties of maintenance, ship builders have been competitive in producing double-hulled ships which are easier to inspect, such as ballast and cargo tanks which are easily accessible and easier to spot corrosion in the hull. The Tanker Structure Cooperative Forum (TSCF) published the Guide to Inspection and Maintenance of Double-Hull Tanker Structures in 1995 giving advice based on experience of operating double-hulled tankers.|$|E

After a while Fohlman decided to do it on a national scale himself. He went on to create the foundation known as Safer Sweden (Tryggare Sverige). Foundation for Safer Sweden was founded on the belief that better forms of collaboration are needed to assist crime victims and deter crime. Safer Sweden performs research and training on crime prevention and security. Safer Sweden provides an ombudsman for victims of crime and has also developed <b>safety</b> <b>guides.</b> The organization is supported by the Swedish Trade Federation, Swedish Housing, and Student Association and many others.
