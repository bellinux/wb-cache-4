40|$|The USDA Global Agricultural Information Network {{released}} a report on March 5 th 2003 detailing how the EU's rice regime operates. It sets out how the standard EU import duties are designed to raise the price of imported brown indica rice to 180 % of the EU <b>intervention</b> <b>price,</b> the price of imported japonica rice to 188 % of the <b>intervention</b> <b>price,</b> and of milled rice to 267 % of the <b>intervention</b> <b>price.</b> However, this duty may not exceed the duty fixed in the EU's Common Customs Tariff, which is a maximum of € 264 /tonne for brown indica rice (currently the <b>intervention</b> <b>price</b> is € 298. 35 /tonne so the maximum duty paid import price is € 537 /tonne). According to this report, because of the low price of rice on world markets in the past year, import duties for brown rice have continued at 264 /t.

50|$|Monetary {{compensatory}} amounts (MCAs) were border {{measures in the}} EU consisting of taxes and subsidies formerly applicable to intra-EC trade in agricultural and food products for which <b>intervention</b> <b>prices</b> were set. These border measures were made necessary {{by the fact that}} <b>intervention</b> <b>prices</b> were set in ECUs and converted into national currency terms at green rates, set at levels different from commercial market rates. This gave rise to price differentials between member nations (in market ECUs) that would influence intra-EC trade if not offset by the MCAs. The system worked by subsidizing exports (and taxing imports) from strong-currency countries, and taxing exports (subsidizing imports) from weak- currency countries.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background One of the {{greatest}} challenges in healthcare is how to best translate research evidence into clinical practice, which includes how to change health-care professionals’ behaviours. A commonly held view is that multifaceted interventions are more effective than single-component interventions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to conduct an overview of systematic reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of multifaceted interventions in comparison to single-component interventions in changing health-care professionals’ behaviour in clinical settings. Methods The Rx for Change database, which consists of quality-appraised systematic reviews of interventions to change health-care professional behaviour, was used to identify systematic reviews for the overview. Dual, independent screening and data extraction was conducted. Included reviews used three different approaches (of varying methodological robustness) to evaluate the effectiveness of multifaceted interventions: (1) effect size/dose-response statistical analyses, (2) direct (non-statistical) comparisons of multifaceted to <b>single</b> <b>interventions</b> and (3) indirect comparisons of multifaceted to <b>single</b> <b>interventions.</b> Results Twenty-five reviews were included in the overview. Three reviews provided effect size/dose-response statistical analyses of the effectiveness of multifaceted interventions; no statistical evidence of a relationship between the number of intervention components and the effect size was found. Eight reviews reported direct (non-statistical) comparisons of multifaceted to single-component interventions; four of these reviews found multifaceted interventions to be generally effective compared to <b>single</b> <b>interventions,</b> while the remaining four reviews found that multifaceted interventions had either mixed effects or were generally ineffective compared to <b>single</b> <b>interventions.</b> Twenty-three reviews indirectly compared the effectiveness of multifaceted to single interventions; nine of which also reported either a statistical (dose-response) analysis (N = 2) or a non-statistical direct comparison (N = 7). The majority (N = 15) of reviews reporting indirect comparisons of multifaceted to <b>single</b> <b>interventions</b> showed similar effectiveness for multifaceted and <b>single</b> <b>interventions</b> when compared to controls. Of the remaining eight reviews, six found <b>single</b> <b>interventions</b> to be generally effective while multifaceted had mixed effectiveness.

30|$|The {{empirical}} assessment investigated about {{intensity and}} speed of VPT and {{on the existence of}} asymmetries. The visual inspection revealed that the three-step reduction of sugar <b>intervention</b> <b>price</b> between 2006 / 07 and 2009 / 10 (and conclusion of intervention purchases from the 2010 / 11 campaign onwards), which was implemented by the 2006 reform, did not fully translate in a decrease of ex-work sugar prices in the EU. Indeed, ex-work prices stayed well above the <b>intervention</b> <b>price</b> {{until the end of the}} 2009 / 10 marketing year, and kept a wide margin over the reference price from October 2009 onwards. Evidence also suggests that the reduction of sugar beet minimum prices introduced by the 2006 reform did not fully translate into an equivalent decrease of sugar beet prices.|$|R
40|$|Objectives The Dutch {{guideline}} {{for cancer}} rehabilitation recommends patients {{to engage in}} multicomponent interventions, i. e. several <b>single</b> <b>interventions</b> combined into a rehabilitation programme. To perform a health economic evaluation of this guideline, data on the cost-effectiveness of these multicomponent interventions is required. However, to date, the interventions´ (cost-) effectiveness is almost exclusively assessed for the <b>single</b> <b>interventions,</b> rather than for the multicomponent intervention, which challenges the health economic analysis of the multicomponent interventions. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify or develop a method that allows to deduct the cost-effectiveness of multicomponent interventions from published data of the <b>single</b> <b>interventions.</b> Methods We searched the literature for articles offering a method or ideas for the development of a method for assessing the cost-effectiveness of multicomponent interventions on the basis of data on the <b>single</b> <b>interventions.</b> The cost-effectiveness gap analysis method, which can be used for assessing the maximum cost of an intervention given a certain willingness-to-pay, was identified as suitable and was further developed to allow assessing if a multidimensional programmes is cost-effective, based on the (cost-) effectiveness data of the <b>single</b> <b>interventions.</b> Results Cost-effectiveness gap analysis was identified in the literature as being a suitable method, with further refinement. We suggested to first calculate the costs of all interventions. Given the effectiveness of one intervention it is then possible to estimate how much additional effectiveness a second (or any subsequent) intervention would have to provide so that the multicomponent intervention remains cost-effective, given a range of ceiling ratios. Recommendations for methods for estimating the additional effect of subsequent interventions were deducted from the literature identified. Conclusions We suggest estimating the cost-effectiveness of the combined interventions as recommended in clinical guidelines by performing a refined cost-effectiveness gap analysis metho...|$|R

40|$|The {{subsidies}} and protection {{structure of the}} sugar sectors in the European Union originated from the individual national protection systems, unified {{with the creation of}} the Common Agricultural Policy. The COM for Sugars is based on an <b>intervention</b> <b>price</b> quite higher than international prices. To determine who benefits from this <b>intervention</b> <b>price,</b> production quotas are established and distributed to each Member- State, producer and raw-material supplier. In parallel, levies are charged on sugar produced and tariffs on imported sugar, which contribute part of total funds required to finance these subsidies. The difference is covered by the community budget. The Eu imports sugar from ex- European colonies, paid at the internal EU price and benefitting from import tariff isention. Most of this sugar is reexported refined. There are other “entrances” for smaller quantities of sugar with preferential treatment, used, among others, by Cuba and Brazil. Subsidies and privileges are being contested internally and externally. Negotiations in international fora (WTO, bilateral talks) and preparation for the accession of East European countries to the EU will probably accelerate the reform of the COM for Sugar.
