5|$|At the {{southwest}} corner of the same intersection, the building housing <b>Sidetrack</b> Bar & Grillwhich has held a bar and restaurant continuously since at least 1850has an unusual shape resulting from a 1929 train derailment. On an early January morning, the twelfth car, laden with lumber, of an 85-car freight train came off the tracks and crashed into the corner of the building. The owner of the building, who lived just above the section that was hit, was uninjured but had most of her personal effects scattered into the street. There were only a few people near the railroad crossing when it derailed including an 18-year-old female who was knocked unconscious and a man who was sitting in his car, but was able to get away unharmed. When the current owners went to build a patio on the spot, they found some of the debris had been piled up underneath, which made it more difficult to dig post holes. In 1931, the entrance to the building was moved from the east side to its current position on the north side to accommodate a post-prohibition law requiring bar entrances to be at least 500 feet from any church. The back patio was constructed after the nearby church burned down. According to <b>Sidetrack</b> owner Linda French, the first-floor walls are three bricks deep, with the oldest remaining bricks dating to the 1850s.|$|E
25|$|Another {{complication}} {{can occur}} in case of incomplete or erroneous regeneration of the damaged facial nerve. The nerve {{can be thought of}} as a bundle of smaller individual nerve connections that branch out to their proper destinations. During regrowth, nerves are generally able to track the original path to the right destination - but some nerves may <b>sidetrack</b> leading to a condition known as synkinesis. For instance, regrowth of nerves controlling muscles attached to the eye may <b>sidetrack</b> and also regrow connections reaching the muscles of the mouth. In this way, movement of one also affects the other. For example, when the person closes the eye, the corner of the mouth lifts involuntarily.|$|E

25|$|A <b>sidetrack</b> is a {{railroad}} track other than siding that is auxiliary {{to the main}} track. The word is also used as a verb (without object) {{to refer to the}} movement of trains and railcars from the main track to a siding, and in common parlance to refer to giving in to distractions apart from a main subject. Sidetracks are used by railroads to order and organize the flow of rail traffic.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic party saw the Preparedness {{movement}} as a threat. Roosevelt, Root and Wood were prospective Republican presidential candidates. More subtly, the Democrats were rooted in localism that appreciated the National Guard, and the voters were hostile to {{the rich and powerful}} in the first place. Working with the Democrats who controlled Congress, Wilson was able to <b>sidetrack</b> the Preparedness forces. Army and Navy leaders were forced to testify before Congress to the effect that the nation's military was in excellent shape.|$|E

In the trunk there were also some of Moro's personal effects, a bracelet and his watch, and some spent cartridges.

25|$|The first railway was the Leiper Railroad, a horse-drawn quarry rail line, {{constructed}} in 1809–1810 {{and used to}} haul cut stone until about 1828. That early rail line was superseded by the Leiper Canal. The first steam-locomotive train came through in 1854; it used a single track with a <b>sidetrack</b> at Wallingford. The first post office in Nether Providence was established at Hinkson's Corner in 1873. Trolleys {{also contributed to the}} area's development. The first independent trolley was the Chester and Media Electric Railway, chartered in 1892. The last trolley through the township closed in 1938. The Nether Providence Police Department was established in 1935, and automobile parking was regulated in 1947 and speed in 1949.|$|E
25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Republican Party in nearly all parts of the South, the region became known as the “Solid South”, and the Democratic Party after 1900 moved to a system of primaries to select their candidates. Victory in a primary was tantamount to election. From the late 1870s to the 1960s, only rarely was a state or national Southern politician a Republican, apart from a few Appalachian mountain districts. Republicans, however, continued to control parts of the Appalachian Mountains and compete for power in the Border States. Apart from a few states (such as the Byrd Machine in Virginia, the Crump Machine in Memphis), and a few other local organizations, the Democratic Party itself was very lightly organized. It managed primaries but party officials had little other role. To be successful a politician built his own network of friends, neighbors and allies. Reelection was the norm, and the result from 1910 to the late 20th century was that Southern Democrats in Congress had accumulated seniority, and automatically took the chairmanships of all committees. By the 1940s the Supreme Court began to find disfranchisement measures like the “grandfather clause” and the white primary unconstitutional. Southern legislatures quickly passed other measures to keep blacks disfranchised, even after suffrage was extended more widely to poor whites. Because white Democrats controlled all the Southern seats in Congress they had outsize power in Congress and could <b>sidetrack</b> or filibuster efforts by Northerners to pass legislation against lynching, for example.|$|E

500|$|The {{exact number}} {{killed in the}} {{takeover}} is unknown. Several sources put the figure anywhere between several dozen and a thousand. According to the ICTY, at least 48 civilians were killed of which 45 were non-Serbs. Around 3 April, a local policeman was ordered to guard a hearse which was picking up bodies from the streets and houses of the town. The killings were eliticidal {{with the aim of}} erasing cultural history and included [...] "political leaders, businessmen, and other prominent Bosniaks", but also included women and children. A number of Serbs who had attempted to stop the massacre were also killed. An investigation by the ICTY later stated that the victims had been shot [...] "in the chest, mouth, temple, or back of the head, some at close range" [...] and that none had been wearing military uniforms. According to the historian Professor Eric D. Weitz of the City College of New York, the killing of Bosniaks in Bijeljina was a genocidal act. The acts against civilians in Bijeljina and those carried out by the JNA and special forces that followed were an attempt to intimidate and <b>sidetrack</b> the Bosnian government and general public from pursuing independence.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the early}} 1890s, {{when he was}} living near Muskogee, Oklahoma, Reed learned that a gold {{shipment}} was leaving Dallas, Texas on November 13, 1894.

2500|$|Having {{moved on}} {{longtime}} scientific research mission to Italy, {{at the turn}} of the decades Tejada was getting increasingly detached from daily Carlist politics. Within the Secretariat and numerous cultural outposts he was also getting dominated by a new breed of young activists forming the entourage of prince Carlos Hugo. Though he knew some, especially their leader Ramón Massó, from the Academia Vázquez de Mella years of the 1940s, Tejada developed grave doubts about Carlist orthodoxy and genuine intentions of the hugocarlistas, suspecting them of pursuing a hidden agenda. Co-operation deteriorated into crisis and then open conflict in the early 1960s, when Don Carlos Hugo started to <b>sidetrack</b> most hard-line Traditionalists. Unlike Valiente and other older militants harboring no illusion about Don Javier potentially confronting his progressist son, in July 1962 Tejada decided to break with the Borbón-Parmas, though some authors claim that he was expulsed. He declared to Don Carlos Hugo that he could not make him king, but could prevent him from becoming one. In 1963 Tejada already referred to Don Carlos Hugo as [...] "este aventurero francés de sangre bastarda".|$|E
