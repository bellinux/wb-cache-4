40|$|Nowadays a great {{attention}} is paid to the level and quality of noise radiated from the tailpipe of intake and exhaust systems, to control the gas dynamic noise emitted by the engine as well as the characteristics of the cabin interior sound. The muffler geometry can be optimized consequently, to attenuate or remark certain spectral components of the engine noise, according to the result expected. Evidently the design of complex silencing systems is a time-consuming operation, which must be carried out by means of concurrent experimental measurements and numerical simulations. In particular, 1 D and multiD linear/non-linear simulation codes can be applied to predict the silencer behavior in the time and frequency domain. This paper describes the development of a 1 D-multiD integrated approach for the simulation of complex muffler configurations such as reverse chambers with inlet and outlet pipe extensions and perforated silencers with the addition of <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> <b>material.</b> The 1 D-multiD integrated approach is exploited to validate the transmission loss prediction of reverse chamber configurations with inlet and outlet extensions. Results have pointed out the capability of capturing transversal resonances at high and mid frequencies.

40|$|The tonal {{character}} of the low frequency internal noise in cars is often due to energy transmission through the tyre at the first few eigenfrequencies of the air cavity of the tyre. The first acoustic mode in the air cavity of a typical stationary car tyre is approximately 224 Hz. At this frequency the tyre is comparatively stiff resulting in a high transmission of energy from the road wheel contact to the car body itself. In order to investigate possible means of reducing this effect, the acoustic field inside a tyre is modelled. Theoretically {{it is found that}} the pressure inside a tyre and the energy transmission through the tyre to the wheel axle and the car body can be reduced by adding a <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> <b>material</b> inside the tyre. This was confirmed by measurements on stationary as well as rotating tyres with and without added sound absorption. For a rotating tyre there is a split of the natural frequency depending on the rotational speed of the tyre. Measurements in a standard passenger car reveal that the noise level inside the car is rather high in a fairly wide frequency range around 224 Hz at normal velocities. This tonal noise can be reduced by adding sound absorption inside a tyre. Models for the prediction and the reduction of the tonal noise are presented. Measured and predicted results are compared and the agreement is found to be good. It is found that the tonal noise can be reduced by up to 9 dB. The effects of the air cavity resonances on the external noise have also been studied. It is estimated that external tyre noise can be reduced 1 dB by adding a <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> <b>material</b> inside tyres. For a car travelling on a road a strong acoustic field is induced between the floor of the car and the road. The impact of this acoustic field can be reduced by mounting a <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> <b>material</b> underneath the car. It is estimated that the A-weighted sound pressure level close to a running car could be reduced by 3 dB by adding this type sound absorption. It is found that aluminium foam could be a suitable <b>sound</b> <b>absorbing</b> <b>material</b> which could be mounted inside tyres and underneath cars. The acoustic and dynamic properties of various types of aluminium foams are discussed. In particular measurement techniques for determining sound absorption at grazing incidence are investigated.

40|$|Abstract. Melt blowing(MB) is {{a process}} for {{producing}} fibrous webs or articles directly from polymers or resins using high-velocity air or another appropriate force to attenuate the filaments. This process is one of the newer and least developed nonwoven processes. This process is unique because it is used almost exclusively to produce microfibers rather than fibers the size of normal textile fibers. MB microfibers generally have diameters in the range of 2 to 4 ㎛, although they may be as small as 0. 1 ㎛ and as large as 10 to 15 ㎛. The material acoustic property for noise absorption is principally based on the efficiency of material structures for damping sound wave reflections.
