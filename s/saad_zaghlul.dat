5|$|On 28 February 1922, the United Kingdom {{issued a}} {{declaration}} through which it unilaterally ended its protectorate over Egypt. As a result, Sultan Fuad I promulgated a decree on 15 March 1922 whereby he adopted {{the title of}} King of Egypt. It {{has been reported that}} the title change was due not only to Egypt's newly independent status as the Kingdom of Egypt, but also to Fuad I's desire to be accorded the same title as the newly installed rulers of the newly created kingdoms of Hejaz, Syria and Iraq. Egyptian nationalist leader <b>Saad</b> <b>Zaghlul</b> maintained that the reason for the change of title from Sultan (equivalent to emperor) to the lesser title of King was because the British would not recognize an independent Egyptian ruler whose title was superior to their own monarch.|$|E
25|$|Both the People and National parties came to {{dominate}} Egyptian politics until World War I, {{but the new}} leaders of the national movement for independence following four arduous years of war (in which Great Britain declared Egypt a British protectorate) were closer to the secular, liberal principles of Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed and the People's Party. Prominent among these was <b>Saad</b> <b>Zaghlul</b> who led the new movement through the Wafd Party. <b>Saad</b> <b>Zaghlul</b> held several ministerial positions before {{he was elected to}} the Legislative Assembly and organized a mass movement demanding an end to the British Protectorate. He garnered such massive popularity among the Egyptian people that he came to be known as 'Father of the Egyptians'.

Soon, however, Napoleon was replaced in Naguib's affections by Mustafa Kamil, the founder of the National Democratic Party, and later he found another mirror in <b>Saad</b> <b>Zaghlul.</b> Some years after he was ousted from power, Naguib also came to somewhat admire Mohandas Gandhi of India.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} argued that until the 1940s, Egypt was more in favour of territorial, Egyptian {{nationalism}} and distant from the pan-Arab ideology.

5000|$|Syrian {{journalist}} Jurji Zaydan {{called for}} an [...] "Egyptian college school" [...] (madrasa kulliya misriyya) in 1900 in his monthly magazine Al-Hilal. He provided two models for this institute of higher education: the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College at Aligarh, India, which delivered a Western-style education in the English language, or the Syrian Protestant College (now the American University of Beirut) in Beirut, run by American missionaries. [...] The new school would provide {{an alternative to the}} student missions to Europe begun under Muhammad Ali. Controversy surrounding Zaydan’s publications would later prevent him from taking a teaching post at the University.A number of other prominent Egyptians {{played a role in the}} university’s foundation. A collection of large landowners, bureaucrats, members of the royal family, and journalists, lawyers, and school teachers including Mustafa Kamil, disciples of Muhammad Abduh such as Qasim Amin and <b>Saad</b> <b>Zaghlul,</b> and eventually Khedive Abbas II and Prince Ahmad Fu’ad I became involved. As Donald M.

50|$|When the war ended, {{the nationalists}} began {{to press the}} British again for independence. In {{addition}} to their other reasons, the Egyptians were influenced by American president Woodrow Wilson, who was advocating self-determination for all nations. In September 1918, Egypt made the first moves toward {{the formation of a}} wafd, or delegation, to voice its demands for independence at the Paris Peace Conference. The idea for a wafd had originated among prominent members of the Umma Party, including Lutfi as Sayyid, <b>Saad</b> <b>Zaghlul,</b> Muhammad Mahmud Pasha, Ali Sharawi, and Abd al Aziz Fahmi.|$|E
50|$|In 1914 as {{a result}} of the {{declaration}} of war with the Ottoman Empire, of which Egypt was nominally a part, Britain declared a Protectorate over Egypt and deposed the Khedive, replacing him with a family member who was made Sultan of Egypt by the British.

50|$|It was {{not until}} the Nasser era more than a decade later that Arab nationalism, and by {{extension}} Arab socialism, became a state policy and a means with which to define Egypt's position in the Middle East and the world, usually articulated vis-à-vis Zionism in the neighboring new state of Israel. Nasser's politics was shaped by his conviction that all the Arab states were contending with anti-imperialist struggles and thus solidarity between them was imperative for independence. He viewed the earlier Egyptian nationalism of <b>Saad</b> <b>Zaghlul</b> as too inward-looking and saw no conflict between Egyptian patriotism (wataniyya) and Arab nationalism (qawmiyya).|$|E
50|$|Unclear policy led to {{nationalist}} {{criticism from}} imperial bases such as Egypt (see <b>Saad</b> <b>Zaghlul,</b> 1919) at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, {{nor was the}} resulting political handling cause for much optimism to privileged witnesses such as Aubrey, T.E.

At the conference, there was a glimpse of further prospect for Aubrey Herbert when the Italian delegates proposed to assume shared responsibility over the Caucasus, an area of vital strategic importance - the Baku oilfields, access from the north to Mosul and Kirkuk. By May 1919, the proposal appeared to be quite empty.|$|E
