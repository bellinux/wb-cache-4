Many noon-time clubs and other clubs that are {{constrained}} by time do their prepared speeches first, followed by Table Topics, followed by evaluations. Dinner clubs in the United States tend to do Table Topics first, and then everyone <b>sits</b> <b>back</b> and relaxes for the after-dinner prepared speeches. Alternatively, some clubs that are very time-conscious do prepared speeches first, then evaluations, saving Table Topics for last.|$|E
500|$|Lloyd and Dillon {{returned}} to England in June 1914. [...] Lloyd started a provincial tour of Liverpool, Aldershot, Southend, Birmingham and Margate, {{and finished the}} summer season at the London Hippodrome. She sang [...] "The Coster Honeymoon in Paris" [...] and [...] "Who Paid the Rent for Mrs Rip Van Winkle?", the latter {{of which had been}} received particularly well with her American audiences. [...] Within a fortnight, Britain was at war, which threw the music-hall world into disarray. The atmosphere in London's music halls had turned patriotic, and theatre proprietors often held charity events and benefits to help the war effort. Lloyd played her part and frequently visited hospitals, including the Ulster Volunteer Force Hospital in Belfast, where she interacted with wounded servicemen. [...] She also toured munitions factories to help boost public morale, but received no official recognition for her work. During 1914, she scored a hit with [...] "A Little of What you Fancy", which critics thought captured her life perfectly up until that point. [...] The song is [...] about a middle-aged woman who encourages the younger generation to enjoy themselves, rather than indulging in life's excitement herself. [...] During the rendition, Lloyd depicts a young couple who cuddle and kiss on a railway carriage, while she <b>sits</b> <b>back</b> and recalls memories of her doing the same in years gone by.|$|E

2500|$|The rack, {{like other}} {{intermediate}} gaits, is smoother than the trot because the hooves hitting the ground individually rather in pairs minimizes {{the force and}} bounce the horse transmits to the rider. [...] To achieve this gait the horse must be in a [...] "hollow position". This means that, instead of a rounded back as seen in dressage horses and others that work off their hind quarters, the spine is curved somewhat downward. [...] This puts the racking horse {{in the best position}} to rack without breaking into another gait. If the rider <b>sits</b> <b>back</b> or leans slightly back, this will encourage the hollow position. This allows the hind legs to trail and makes the rack easier for the horse. [...] The downside of this is that this position weakens the back and makes the horse less able to carry the weight of the rider without strain.|$|E
2500|$|... "Scheme is overrated, I've always {{believed}} that. What's not overrated is getting {{your kids to}} play with great effort, great attitude and great enthusiasm. Those are things we can control on a daily basis, {{and that will be}} my primary goal[...] [...] [...] The philosophy of our defense is attack-oriented, attack and react. We want to be a defense that is multiple, that is always putting pressure and forcing the hand of the offense. We want to be a penetrating defense. If you're going to (ask) what our objectives are? The one thing {{we want to do is}} stop the run, force them to throw the ball on first down, create negative plays on first down [...] [...] [...] and get ourselves in position to force them to throw the ball. Get them one-dimensional. We don't want to be a defense that <b>sits</b> <b>back.</b> We want to be a defense that creates turnovers and scores touchdowns." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{standing}} back handspring {{begins with}} a three phase sequence known as [...] "up, sit, jump". In the up phase, the gymnast stands up straight on flat feet, with arms in front at an angle slightly above horizontal. In the sit phase, the gymnast swings the arms down by {{the sides of the}} torso, bends knees, and <b>sits</b> <b>back</b> as if sitting in a chair; while in this position, the gymnast is unbalanced. Together, the sit and jump phases impart angular momentum to the body, causing it to rotate. In the jump phase, the gymnast swings both arms up by the ears and jumps into the air while transitioning to an arch position, with the head in a neutral position, arms and legs straight, and feet together; this body shape is maintained until the hands contact the floor. With hands on the floor, the body's angular momentum is used to transform the gymnast's body shape from an arch, through a linear shape, to a [...] "hollow" [...] shape. The hands are then pushed against the floor, causing the body to lift off from the floor while the body continues its feet-first rotation. Finally, the feet land on the floor, behind the body's center of gravity, and the remaining angular momentum is depleted as it carries the gymnast to a stationary standing position.|$|E

Twenty coffee cups, a dozen liqueur glasses, and a solid bank of blue smoke which swirls slowly along the high, gilded ceiling gives a hint of a successful gathering. But the members have shredded off to their homes. The line of heavy, bulge-pocketed overcoats and of stethoscope-bearing top hats is gone from the hotel corridor. Round the fire in the sitting-room three medicos are still lingering, however, all smoking and arguing, while a fourth, who is a mere layman and young at that, <b>sits</b> <b>back</b> at the table. Under cover of an open journal he is writing furiously with a stylographic pen, asking a question in an innocent voice {{from time to time and}} so flickering up the conversation whenever it shows a tendency to wane.|$|E
