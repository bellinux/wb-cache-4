50|$|A {{rotary phase}} {{converter}} is a three-phase motor with special starting arrangements and {{power factor correction}} that produces balanced three-phase voltages. When properly designed, these rotary converters can allow satisfactory operation of a three-phase motor on a <b>single-phase</b> <b>source.</b> In such a device, the energy storage is performed by the inertia (flywheel effect) of the rotating components.

50|$|A phase {{converter}} is {{a device that}} converts electric power provided as single phase to multiple phase or vice versa. The majority of {{phase converter}}s are used to produce three-phase electric power from a <b>single-phase</b> <b>source,</b> thus allowing the operation of three-phase equipment at a site that only has single-phase electrical service. Phase converters are used where three-phase service is not available from the utility, or is too costly to install due to a remote location. A utility will generally charge a higher fee for a three-phase service because of the extra equipment for transformers and metering and the extra transmission wire.|$|E
40|$|A {{three-phase}} {{induction motor}} has {{higher efficiency than}} the single-phase motor counterpart. It is possible to run a three-phase motor with a <b>single-phase</b> <b>source</b> to develop a single-phase high efficiency system. The single-phase high efficiency motor, or SHE-motor, uses capacitor banks to operate at a balanced three phase induction motor using a single phase source. Unfortunately, this design has been limited, as {{it can only be}} balanced for one load configuration at a time. This provides the system to have maximum system performance. Due to this limitation in operations, it has proven to be non-ideal in commercial applications. It is seen that conventional three-phase induction motors are more practical and better suited for field applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{three-phase}} {{asymmetric induction}} motor {{is an excellent}} solution in rural areas where only single-phase system exists. In those cases very often it is desired to drive mechanical loads which power is well beyond the maximum economical power limit for single-phase induction motors. A typical problem faced by farmers in Brazil. The three-phase asymmetric induction motor follows the same design pattern in a production line for the ordinary three-phase squirrel cage induction motor, estimated production costs doesn’t change substantially in both cases. The unique differences for both motors are the number of windings {{in two of the}} stator phases and the capacitor between the open phase and one of the connected phases. With stator windings Y connected, the asymmetric induction motor can have a <b>single-phase</b> <b>source</b> applying voltage “V” " between 2 of the terminals, with an auxiliary capacitor “Cap”, this extra component solves the starting problem and improves the performance at nominal operating point condition.

40|$|Voltage source {{inverters}} {{operated by}} predictive control methods generally {{lead to a}} variable switching frequency, because predictive control methods generate switching operation based on an optimal voltage state selected at every sampling period. Varying switching frequencies {{make it difficult to}} design output filters of voltage source inverters. This paper proposes a predictive control algorithm with a constant switching frequency for the load current control of <b>single-phase</b> voltage <b>source</b> inverters. This method selects two future optimal voltage states used in the subsequent sampling period, which are a zero-voltage state and a future optimal voltage state, based on the slope of the reference current at each sampling period. After selecting the two future voltages, the proposed method distributes them to produce a constant switching frequency and symmetric switching pattern. The performance of the proposed method is validated with both simulation and experimental results for <b>single-phase</b> voltage <b>source</b> inverters...|$|R
40|$|Three-phase {{system has}} {{numerous}} advantages over the single-phase system {{in terms of}} instantaneous power, stability, and cost. Three-phase systems are not available in every location particularly in remote rural areas, hill stations, low voltage distribution homes, and so forth. Having {{a system that is}} capable of converting directly the readily available single-phase system to three phases will have greater usability in various applications. The routine techniques adopted in the direct ac-ac single-phase-to-three-phase converters do not yield the best desired outputs because of their complexity in the segregation process and bidirectional nature of the input signal. Other initiatives use ac-dc-ac converters which are huge and costly due to dc link energy storage devices. Further, none of these systems provide a convincing result in producing the standard three-phase output voltages that are 120 ° away from each other. This paper proposes an effective direct ac-ac single-phase-to-three-phase conversion technique based on space vector pulse width modulation based matrix converter system that produces a convincing three-phase output signals from a <b>single-phase</b> <b>source</b> with balanced modulation index characteristics.

40|$|The {{theory of}} the {{condenser}} motor is the operation of a poly-phase motor on a <b>single-phase</b> <b>source.</b> If we consider the current in one phase of a two-phase motor the IR drop is in phase with the current I and the reactance drop is {{at right angles to}} it. The voltage OB across the phase is the vector sum of these two. Now if a condenser is connected in series with this phase the reactance drop across the condenser will be opposite to that in the winding. The voltage across the condenser is BC and the total voltage across the condenser and the phase in series with it is OC. This is the line voltage. If the other phase of a two-phase motor is connected directly across the line the two phases will have voltages impressed on them which are electrically displaced by the angle BOC. By assigning a proper value to the capacitance of the condenser this angle can be made equal to 90 degrees. The voltage OB, however, will not be equal to the line voltage unless the angle BOA is equal to 45 degrees, that is, the power factor of the phase must be 70. 7 per cent. It is not necessary to design both phases of the motor for the same voltage so that this condition does not present any great difficulty...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{some results}} of {{experiment}} on modification of induction motor into generator are described. Not as usually done on three-phase motor, the modification {{has been done}} on capacitor motors normally supplied with <b>single-phase</b> <b>source.</b> The resulted induction generator should be able to self-excite and has been intended for low-power, low-speed applications. These applications are prospective for example in rural renewable energy generations and as motors for some special electric vehicles. Machine modification instead of total design-production or new machine acquisition is considered more appropriate for remote rural electrification. Distance and transportation difficulties, unavailability of nearby machine industry, lack of human resources with ‘high-tech savvy 2 ̆ 7, besides the low purchasing power of population in remote rural areas are some reasons behind the consideration. Experiment results indicated that voltage generation up to nominal value is not always easy to attain in a capacitor motor, even when functioning beyond its synchronous speed. An additional pre-charged capacitor should be used to initiate voltage generation. During start-up, load and the pre-charged capacitor had to be removed from generator to avoid capacitor discharge. Load could then be added gradually once generator approached its nominal output value. It was also shown that in order to generate power the generator must be rotating over its synchronous speed. The resulted frequency values did not vary linearly to the rotation speed and the obtained efficiency was still low...|$|E

40|$|The {{topology}} {{and control}} are discussed of a distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) {{that can be}} operated flexibly in the voltage or current control mode. In the voltage control mode, the DSTATCOM can force the voltage of a distribution bus to be balanced sinusoids.
