5|$|Cannabis {{can be a}} {{contributory}} {{factor in}} schizophrenia, potentially causing the disease in those who are already at risk. The increased risk may require the presence of certain genes within an individual or {{may be related to}} preexisting psychopathology. Early exposure is <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> an increased risk. The size of the increased risk is not clear, but appears to be in the range of two to three times greater for psychosis. Higher dosage and greater frequency of use are indicators of increased risk of chronic psychoses.|$|E
5|$|Cervical {{stenosis}} {{refers to}} an abnormally narrow cervical canal, typically associated with trauma caused by removal of tissue for investigation or treatment of cancer, or cervical cancer itself. Diethylstilbestrol, used from 1938 to 1971 to prevent preterm labour and miscarriage, is also <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the development of cervical stenosis and other abnormalities in {{the daughters of the}} exposed women. Other abnormalities include: vaginal adenosis, in which the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix becomes columnar; cancers such as clear cell adenocarcinomas; cervical ridges and hoods; and development of a cockscomb cervix appearance.|$|E

40|$|Paraneoplastic {{neurological}} syndromes are a {{group of}} neurological syndromes secondary to an underlying malignancy. Associated autoantibodies can be classified according to the cellular localization of the antigen target.

By the mid-20th century, pastel colours (rose pink, baby blue, light yellow, etc.) became popular, and they remain the colours that most people most <b>strongly</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> these buildings.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{acquired}} conditions augment {{the risk of}} thrombosis. A prominent example is antiphospholipid syndrome, which is caused by antibodies against constituents of the cell membrane, particularly lupus anticoagulant (first found in people with the disease systemic lupus erythematosus but often detected in people without the disease), anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies; it is therefore regarded as an autoimmune disease. In some cases antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial as well as venous thrombosis. It is also more <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> miscarriage, and can cause {{a number of other}} symptoms (such as livedo reticularis of the skin and migraine).|$|E

DMZ has showcased new dubstep artists such as Skream, Kode9, Benga, Pinch, DJYoungsta, Hijak, Joe Nice, and Vex'd. DMZ's first anniversary event (at the Mass venue, a converted church) saw fans attending from places {{as far away as}} Sweden, the United States, and Australia, leading to a queue of 600 people at the event. This forced the club to move from its regular 400-capacity space to Mass' main room, an event cited as a pivotal moment in dubstep's history.|$|E

The Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal is a famous sequence of Assyrian palace reliefs from c. 640 BC, now in the British Museum. The Nemean lion was symbolic in Ancient Greece and Rome, represented as the constellation and zodiac sign Leo, and described in mythology, where its skin was borne by the hero Heracles.|$|E
40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} <b>strongly</b> <b>associates</b> <b>with</b> decreased {{nitric oxide}} (NO) bioavailability and endothelial dysfunction. In the vasculature NO mediates multiple processes affecting insulin delivery, including dilating both resistance and terminal arterioles in skeletal muscle in vivo. However, whether NO directly regulates vascular endothelial cell (EC) insulin uptake and its trans-endothelial transport (TET) is unknown. Here {{we report that}} L-NAME pre-treatment blocked while L-arginine or sodium nitroprusside (SNP), each enhanced EC uptake of fluoroisothiocyanate (FITC) -labeled insulin.

40|$|Polyelectrolytes with {{amphiphilic}} counterions, PEACs, are {{water insoluble}} because the amphiphiles self-assemble into highly charged micelles that <b>strongly</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> the equally highly charged polyions. However, {{in the presence}} of water soluble cyclodextrins (CDs) that form inclusion complexes with the amphiphiles and prevent micellization, PEACs become soluble as the dispersed amphiphiles behave essentially as simple monovalent counterions. In this paper, we illustrate, by example, how strongly the ternary phase behavior of PEAC:CD:water depends on the polyion flexibility; for a highly flexible polyion (polyacrylate) the amphiphilic aggregates dictate the phase behavior, whereas a much stiffer polyion (DNA) itself dictates liquid crystalline ordering...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHuman SFMBT (hSFMBT) is {{postulated}} to be a Polycomb (PcG) protein. Similar {{to other}} PcG proteins, {{we found that}} hSFMBT displays robust transcriptional repressor activity. In addition, hSFMBT localized to the nucleus where it <b>strongly</b> <b>associates</b> <b>with</b> chromatin by directly and selectively binding the N-terminal tail of histone H 3. Importantly, we discovered that the four tandem MBT repeats of hSFMBT were sufficient for nuclear matrix-association, N-terminal tail H 3 binding, and required for transcriptional repression. These findings indicate that the tandem MBT repeats form a functional structure required for biological activity of hSFMBT and predict similar properties for other MBT domain-containing proteins...|$|R
5|$|Autism {{is caused}} by a {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Some cases are <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example the vaccine hypotheses, which have been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the DSM V, autism is included within the autism spectrum (ASDs), as is Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met.|$|E
5|$|Congenital liver abnormalities, such as Caroli's {{syndrome}} (a {{specific type}} of five recognized choledochal cysts), {{have been associated with}} an approximately 15% lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma. The rare inherited disorders Lynch syndrome II and biliary papillomatosis have also been found to be associated with cholangiocarcinoma. The presence of gallstones (cholelithiasis) is not clearly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. However, intrahepatic stones (called hepatolithiasis), which are rare in the West but common in parts of Asia, have been <b>strongly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> cholangiocarcinoma. Exposure to Thorotrast, a form of thorium dioxide which was used as a radiologic contrast medium, has been linked to the development of cholangiocarcinoma as late as 30–40 years after exposure; Thorotrast was banned in the United States in the 1950s due to its carcinogenicity.|$|E
