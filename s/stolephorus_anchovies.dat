Zoological Studies 47 (5) : xxx-xxx. To understand the reproductive strategies and recruitment dynamics of the gold estuarine <b>anchovy</b> <b>Stolephorus</b> insularis in a subtropical area, their seasonal abundance was investigated, and their hatching period and growth rate were estimated from otolith daily growth increments. Specimens were collected from the Tatu River estuary on the west-central coast of Taiwan during 1997 - 1998. Juvenile fish dominated the catch composition, suggesting that the estuary is a nursery for newly recruited juveniles of S. insularis. The distribution of hatching dates for anchovy in subtropical Taiwan {{was similar to that}} of temperate zone fish, with a major spawning season in spring and a minor spawning season in autumn. This spawning strategy coincided with a new production cycle that was higher in spring than in autumn.

40|$|Fisheries {{should be}} a {{sustainable}} economic activity {{in order to maintain}} its services in the future. Sustainable marine fisheries resources exploitation requires a utilization rate lower than the resources availability. Therefore, the exploitation rate should not achieve the recovery ability of the resources in any particular period. In fishing activities, for instance, there is a guideline not to catch fish over the Total Allowable Catch (TAC), 80 % of the MSY value. The exploitation rate of the <b>anchovy</b> (<b>Stolephorus</b> sp.) in Dodinga Bay was still low. It could result from small-scaled traditional fishermen and low fishing distance from the shore. Their income was also low due to high operational cost and fluctuation in fish price. To improve the fishermen prosperity, it is necessary to raise the fishing productivity and the efficiency of production input utilization on the boat lift net. This study focused on understanding the anchovy fishing season of the boat lift net in Dodinga Bay to analyze the yearly fishing seasons for the last five years. Results concluded that the fishing season of the <b>anchovy</b> (<b>Stolephorus</b> sp.) in Dodinga Bay could be separated into two phases, March to June and October to November, but the former was more extensive and lager in scale than the later...|$|R

40|$|Usually, {{there are}} two types of fishing lamp used by bagan {{fisherman}} to attract and catch fish: pressured kerosene lamp and electric lamp. The first type is commonly used on the small sized bagan like raft bagan in Pelabuhan Ratu Bay and the second type is used on the large bagan like boat bagan (known as "bagan rambo" in south Sulawesi) in Makassar strait. 	The pattern of light intensity distribution of both fishing lamps in the air was almost the same, i. e., is butterfly shaped. The highest intensity was recorded at the angle of 90,??? i. e., 170 lx for kerosene and 2, 700 lx for mercury lamps. The pattern of the underwater light intensity was found different between the bagan. Due to the pattern of light position and lighting power, mercury lamps can illuminate deeper water column than pressured kerosene lamp. At 8 m depth The underwater illumination of boat bagan and raft bagan were 47 lx and 0. 1 lx, respectively. 	The catch of both bagan was dominated by <b>anchovy</b> <b>Stolephorus</b> sp.

40|$|Abstract. —We {{evaluated}} survivorship, tag retention, {{and growth}} of juvenile walleyes Stizostedion vitreum hand-tagged with binary-coded wire micro tags (BCWMTs) or cold-branded with liquid nitrogen. A single BCWMT could be injected via the hand-tagging technique every 5 - 10 s and tagging with BCWMTs was superior to cold-branding. Fish with dorsally injected BCWMTs had significantly greater mean survival than the caudally injected group but not greater survival than the cold-branded group. There was no difference (P> 0. 05) in survival among {{any of the three}} control groups. Microtags were retained equally well in dorsal and caudal locations, and significantly better than cold brands. Fish grew significantly in standard length during the 66 -d evaluation period (P < 0. 05) and increased (though not significantly) in wet weight. Treatment and control groups were not significantly different in attained size, suggesting no differential growth depression due to marking method or location. Fishery biologists have developed numerous ways to mark fish for studies of migration, mor-tality, growth, habitat use, and other aspects of life history (Wydoski and Emery 1983; Parker et al. 1990). One marking technique that does not mu-tilate fish or affect their behavior and growth is injection of binary-coded wire microtags (BCWMTs), which were first described by Jefferts etal. (1963). Coded wire microtags (1 -mm-long x 0. 25 -mm-diameter stainless steel wires) have been used suc-cessfully in many fish studies, although there have been mixed results in terms of survival and tag retention. For example, when BCWMTs were used on <b>anchovies</b> <b>Stolephorus</b> purpureus smaller than 57 mm (standard length), mean survival was 80. 5 % and tag retention was 85. 3 % (Leary and Murph...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviewed}} fish catch {{production and}} estimated demand of aquafeed, fish meal, fish oil, soybean meal in Viet Nam for year 2013. Fish catch production was around 2. 8 {{million metric tons}} (mt) while marine fish production was 1. 9 million mt. Estimated marine trash fish production was 0. 8 million mt with over 100 species including the dominant species <b>anchovy</b> (<b>Stolephorus</b> spp.), lizard fish (Saurida spp.) and pony fish (Leistognathus spp.). Approximately 0. 5 million mt of marine trash fish was used for livestock, aquaculture and fish meal. Local marine fish meal consisting of protein content from 50 to 68 % and catfish byproduct meal containing protein level from 50 to 60 % were available. Based on FCR values of 5 major species including catfish, black tiger shrimp, white leg shrimp, Asian seabass, and snake head, aquafeed production was estimated at around 2. 5 million mt. Marine fish oil/squid liver oil requirement was from 15. 5 to 31 thousand mt. Fish meal demand was from 252 and 430 thousand mt. Almost all fish meal and marine fish oil used in aquafeed were imported. Moreover, soybean and other plant ingredients are potential alternative sources to replace fish meal and fish oil. Vietnamese farmers produced 168 thousand mt soybean while soybean demand amounts for aquafeed were from 693 to 1, 140 thousand mt. In 2013, feedmills imported approximately 3 million mt of soybean meal (cake) from many countries in the world. Some other plant protein sources which were also imported, have good nutrient profiles but they contain some anti-nutritional factors. In the future, research on replacement of fish meal and fish oil with plant and animal by-product sources and feed additives for aquafeed should be studied. In particular, the management of local fish meal plants and capture fishery should be improved...|$|R
50|$|The 2004 marine {{production}} in Thailand was composed of: pelagic fish 33 percent, demersal fish 18 percent, cephalopod 7.5 percent, crustaceans 4.5 percent, trash fish 30 percent and others 7 percent. Trash fish refers to non-edible species, edible species of low commercial value and juveniles, which are {{released to the}} sea. Pelagic fishes were distributed between <b>anchovies</b> (<b>Stolephorus</b> spp., 19 percent), Indo-Pacific mackerel (Rastrelliger brachysoma, 18 percent), sardinellas (Sardinellars spp., 14 percent), scad (11 percent), longtail tuna (Thunnus tonggol, 9 percent), eastern little tuna (Euthynnus affinis, 6 percent), trevallies (6 percent), bigeye scad (5 percent), Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta, 4 percent), king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla, 3 percent), torpedo scad (Megalaspis cordyla , 2 percent), wolf herrings (1 percent), and others (2 percent). Demersal fish production was dominated by purple-spotted bigeye (Priacanthus tayenus), threadfin bream (Nemipterus hexodon), brushtooth lizardfish (Saurida undosquamis), slender lizardfish (Saurida elongata) and Jinga shrimp (Metapenaeus affinis). Most species are overfished since the 1970s-1990s, except for Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commersoni), carangidae and torpedo scad (Meggalaspis spp.). The overall overfishing rate was 333 percent for pelagic and 245 percent for demersal species in 1991. Cephalopods are divided into squid, cuttlefish and molluscs, where squid and cuttlefish in Thai waters consists of 10 families, 17 genera and over 30 species. The main mollusk species captured in the Andaman Sea are scallop, blood cockle (Anadara granosa) and short-necked clam. Their collection requires bottom dredge gears, which damage the sea floor and the gears themselves and are becoming unpopular. So, the mollusk production has decreased from 27,374 tonnes in 1999 to 318 tonnes in 2004. While crustaceans composed only 4.5 {{percent of the total}} marine products in 2004 by volume, they accounted for 21 percent of the total value. They were dominated by banana prawn, tiger prawn, king prawn, school prawn, bay lobster (Thenus orientalis), mantis shrimp, swimming crabs and mud crabs. The total catch in 2004 was 51,607 tonnes for squid and cuttlefish and 36,071 tonnes for crustaceans.|$|R
