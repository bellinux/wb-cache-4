2500|$|The schooner-barge Michigan {{was never}} seen {{again after the}} night of 2 October 1901. The wreck of Drake was first {{discovered}} by Captain Campbell of Liberty just 4 days after she sank on 6 October 1901, when he was downbound for the Soo Locks. Captain Campbell reported that Drake was located between Vermilion Point and Whitefish Point lying on her side in [...] of water with about [...] feet of water over her with a floating spar still strung to the hull. The wreck of Drake lay forgotten {{on the bottom of}} Lake Superior for 77 years until she was rediscovered at [...] in 1978, by the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS) who subsequently illegally removed her rudder, windlass, anchor, and a <b>sign</b> <b>board</b> in the 1980s. Michigan’s Antiquities Act of 1980 prohibited the removal of artifacts from shipwrecks on the Great Lakes bottomlands. The Evening News reported a Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment 1992 raid on the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum and its offices that found evidence of 150 artifacts illegally removed from the state-claimed bottomlands, including artifacts from Drake. Following a settlement agreement with the GLSHS, Drakes rudder, anchor, and windlass are now the property of the State of Michigan. [...] The rudder is on loan to the GLSHS for display nearby the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum and the anchor and windlass is on loan to Whitefish Township for display next to its community building.|$|E

60|$|A faint {{heartbeat}} of the street's ancient glory still survives in {{a corner}} occupied by the Café Carabine d'Or. Once men gathered there to plot against kings, and to warn presidents. They do so yet, {{but they are not}} the same kind of men. A brass button will scatter these; those would have set their faces against an army. Above the door hangs the <b>sign</b> <b>board,</b> upon which has been depicted a vast animal of unfamiliar species. In the act of firing upon this monster is represented an unobtrusive human levelling an obtrusive gun, once the colour of bright gold. Now the legend above the picture is faded beyond conjecture; the gun's relation to the title is a matter of faith; the menaced animal, wearied of the long aim of the hunter, has resolved itself into a shapeless blot.|$|E
60|$|Private Joseph Drakes, {{with the}} {{generosity}} of an enemy expecting drink-money, pointed out the <b>sign,</b> <b>board</b> {{on the face of}} the crag commemorating 'Montgomery's death'; and then showed them the officers' quarters and those of the common soldiers, not far from which was a line of hang-dog fellows drawn up to receive sentence for divers small misdemeanors, from an officer whose blond whiskers drooped Dundrearily from his fresh English cheeks. There was that immense difference between him and the men in physical grandeur and beauty, which is so notable in the aristocratically ordered military services of Europe, and which makes the rank seem of another race from the file. Private Drakes saluted his superior, and visibly deteriorated in his presence, though his breast was covered with medals, and he had fought England's battles in every part of the world. It was a gross injustice, the triumph of a thousand years of wrong; and it was touching to have Private Drakes say that he expected in three months to begin life for himself, after twenty years' service of the Queen; and did they think he could get anything to do in the States? He scarcely knew what he was fit for, but he thought--to so little in him came the victories he had helped to win in the Crimea, in China, and in India--that he coald take care of a gentleman's horse and work about his place. He looked inquiringly at Basil, as if he might be a gentleman with a horse to be taken care of and a place to be worked about, and made him regret that he was not a man of substance enough to provide for Private Drakes and Mrs. Drakes and the brood of Ducklings, who had been shown to him stowed away in one of those cavernous rooms in the earthworks where the married soldiers have their quarters. His regret enriched the reward of Private Drakes' service,--which perhaps answered one of Private Drakes' purposes, if not his chief aim. He promised to come to the States upon the pressing advice of Isabel, who, speaking from her own large experience, declared that everybody got on there,--and he bade our friends an affectionate farewell as they drove away to the Plains of Abraham.|$|E

50|$|The {{signs were}} a {{prominent}} {{feature of the}} streets of London at this period. But here and in other large towns they became a danger and a nuisance in the narrow ways.
