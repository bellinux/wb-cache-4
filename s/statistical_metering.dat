The organisms specified for testing were larval fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, and the daphnid, Ceriodaphnia dubia. Surface water samples were collected from Clinch River Mile 9. 0, Poplar Creek Mile 1. 0, and Poplar Creek Mile 2. 9 on January 24, 26, and 28. Samples were partitioned and provided to the CR-ERP and TVA toxicology laboratories for testing. Exposure of test organisms to these samples resulted in no toxicity (survival or growth) to fathead minnows; however, toxicity to daphnids was demonstrated in undiluted samples from Poplar Creek Mile 1. 0 in testing conducted by TVA based on hypothesis testing of data. Point estimation (IC{sub 25 }) analysis of the data, however, showed no toxicity in PCM 1. 0 samples.

30|$|A {{total of}} 20 {{groundwater}} samples {{have been collected}} from dug and bore wells during March 2013 and analyzed to understand the physicochemical variations of water quality parameters using standard methods (APHA 1995). Samples were collected in one liter capacity high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles. Prior to collection, the bottles were thoroughly washed with dilute HNO 3 acid, and then with distilled water in the laboratory before sample filling. Each bottle was rinsed to avoid any possible contamination in bottling and every other precautionary measure was taken. Each groundwater sample was analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), major cations and anions. The pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and total dissolved solids (TDS) were measured in situ using HANNA portable water quality meter (HI- 9828, USA). The total hardness (TH) and calcium were estimated by titrimetric method using EDTA and magnesium concentration was estimated by {{the difference in the}} hardness and calcium. Total alkalinity, bicarbonate, and chloride were estimated by titrimetric methods. The concentrations of sodium and potassium were estimated by flame photometer (DEEP VISION, Model- 381). The sulfate and nitrate ions were analyzed by the UV-Visible Spectrophotometer. Fluoride was estimated by using an ion-selective electrode (ISE) with a pH/ISE <b>meter.</b> <b>Statistical</b> analysis such as correlation matrix and factor analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics. Major hydrochemical facies were identified through Piper trilinear diagram (Piper 1944) using Aquachem Scientific v 4.0 software.
