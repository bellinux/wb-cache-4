Tracy is annoyed because {{he is unable to}} attend due to a recent order from a courtroom judge which requires him to wear an alcohol monitoring ankle bracelet. Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) is also annoyed because he believes that none of the staff know what the true meaning of Christmas is. He cancels Ludachristmas and makes the staff <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> a talk, led by himself and Reverend Gary (John F Mooney), about the meaning of Christmas. This inspires {{the cast and}} writers to run outside of 30 Rock and tear down the big Christmas tree which is outside the building. Kenneth eventually stops their efforts and Tracy reveals that he has been drinking alcohol when he should not have been.|$|E

Edwards, a theater employee in Scotia, California, said it was [...] "without doubt the most unsatisfactory picture we have any recollection of." [...] The failure to generate considerable income at the box office (on top of the financial failure of Lewton and Robson's follow-up picture, The Ghost Ship) would result in Lewton scrapping two planned projects, The Screaming Skull and The Amorous Ghost.|$|E

500|$|Covering {{the event}} for Doctor Who Magazine, David Darlington {{noted that the}} stated aim of the Proms is [...] "to {{encourage}} an audience for concert hall music who, though not normally attending classical concerts, would be attracted by the low ticket prices and informal atmosphere" [...] and concluded that if {{the children in the}} audience had such a love for Doctor Who [...] "that they have come all this way to spend an hour or two listening to the music from the show, and that they will happily also <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> a formal, experimental and rather abrasive piece of modern classical music and then enthusiastically applaud at the end, then all concerned can be happy with their day's work." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on April 23, 1971. Melvin Van Peebles stated that [...] "at first, only two theaters in the United States would show the picture: one in Detroit, and one in Atlanta. The first night in Detroit, it broke all the theater's records, and that was only {{on the strength of}} the title alone, since nobody had seen it yet. By the second day, people would take their lunch and <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> it three times. I knew that I was finally talking to my audience. Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song made thousands of dollars in its first day." [...] The film grossed $15,000,000+ at the box office (about $90 million in 2016 dollars).|$|E
500|$|Writing for NDTV, Anupama Chopra {{gave the}} film 2 out of 5, criticising the slow {{screenplay}} and artificial characters who [...] "are {{supposed to be}} unemployed, lonely, and desperately sad, but they always look like they've {{stepped out of the}} pages of a fashion magazine. Which could have been overlooked if there was any depth in their angst, but these two seem like spoilt kids playing suicide-suicide." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-News18 panned the film, calling it [...] "deathly boring [...] a challenge to <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> for two reasons in particular– the film has no script to speak of, and the characters are hard to sympathize with. It lacks in terms of interesting plot and consistent characterization".|$|E

500|$|The {{documentary}} {{was directed}} by Jonas Åkerlund. Barry Walters from Rolling Stone commented that [...] "Jonas Akerlund's 2005 kinetic yet personable documentary of Madonna's 2004 Re-Invention Tour lacks the dishy delights of the diva's 1991 Truth or Dare doc. Instead, a more worldly Madge struggles to become a less sound-bite-reliant, more sincere person. The bonus live CD proves that she's a better singer." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic complimented the release saying [...] "as Madonna's first live CD, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret is strong and entertaining, {{and even if the}} excessive minutiae on the accompanying DVD means only hardcore fans will <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> its two hours, it's also quite well done." [...] The release debuted at number33 on the Billboard 200 and the top ten in Canada and the European Top 100 Albums chart.|$|E
500|$|Monthly teen {{magazine}} Seventeen called Purr's bottle design [...] "cute". Miriam Lacey of Popsugar's spin-off website BellaSugar {{gave the}} perfume a favorable review {{and said it}} smelt [...] "like a fancier, less chemical-laden version" [...] of fruit-scented body sprays. In her review, Lacey also called Purr an [...] "upside-down" [...] fragrance, because unlike most perfumes which [...] "open with their prettiest notes and then end with a relatively generic bottom accord", Purr has a [...] "really nice caramel and sweet patchouli dry down that fans of Angel will adore, but to get there, you have to <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> a bunch of fruity opening notes". Lacey observed that its scent only lasted about 2 hours; {{she thought it would}} be better to spray it onto your hairbrush, [...] "since the oils on your scalp will help it last longer".|$|E
500|$|Already {{before the}} {{national}} convention, the entire local party chapter in Osterøy was disestablished, but mainly {{due to the}} European Union controversy.

Eidesvik was {{a former member of}} the central board, and also a former deputy member of Parliament. The same day former MP and youth wing leader Pål Atle Skjervengen withdrew, commenting that the libertarians [...] "are asked by the party leadership to go to hell". Skjervengen had been criticized by Carl I. Hagen from the rostrum at the national convention. Many years down the road Skjervengen joined the Conservative Party.

The writer illustrates this concept by invoking a meeting between him, Mitică, and Mitică's wife Graziella. Caragiale recounts how his friend served him and others a copious dinner in his house, and then made them <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> Graziella's reading of her own lengthy essay on women as portrayed in Romanian folklore. To this goal, Caragiale explains, Mitică discreetly claimed that it was ţal and added, using a quasi-official parlance, that [...] "all bills are to be paid". The piece ends with Caragiale exiting Mitică's house in haste and: as the latter shouts [...] "to be seeing each other", he exclaims [...] "to be left alone, Mitică".|$|E

His lyrics described the narrator's growing frustration over a crossed-wire phone connection with a female subject. On [...] "Human Being", an ode to self-respect and personal liberty, Thunders introduced his guitar playing with a roughly performed variation on Bill Doggett's 1956 song [...] "Honky Tonk".

500|$|Due to {{both the}} film's {{explicit}} nature and award contender status, 12 Years a Slaves financial success was being watched closely. Many analysts compared the film's content to other drama films of a similar vein such as Schindler's List (1993) and The Passion of the Christ (2004), which became box office successes despite their respective subject matters. [...] "It may be a tough subject matter, but when handled well... films that are tough to <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> can still be commercially successful," [...] said Phil Contrino of Boxoffice Magazine. Despite its content, the film's critical success has assisted its domestic distribution by Fox Searchlight that began with a limited released aimed primarily towards art house and African-American patrons. The film's release was gradually widened in subsequent weeks, similarly to how the studio had successfully done in years prior with films such as Black Swan and The Descendants. International release dates for 12 Years a Slave were largely delayed to early 2014 {{in order to take}} advantage of the attention created by awards seasons.|$|E
500|$|The single reel film, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on January 31, 1911. The Billboard praised Marie Eline's acting also noting the good photography in its review. The Moving Picture Worlds review states, [...] "The part played by the grandmother and the one played by the child are both pathetic and cannot fail to touch the heart. The person who can <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> this and not feel the tears welling up to his eyes is strangely callous to human grief and emotion." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was open in its praise of the film and its portrayal of the subject through good acting, but it also noted the technical faults with film continuity. The reviewer wrote, [...] "It was noticed that the old lady's bag was brought on immediately, already packed, {{when she left the}} son's house and when she left the home. It looks planned beforehand – similar incidents have hurt the excellence of a number of this company's superior films. It would take time in life, and a split in the film would have done it.

5000|$|John Simon {{wrote in}} The National Review that the film, “may {{be the worst}} movie musical of this or any decade: <b>Sitting</b> <b>through</b> this movie is like having someone at a fancy Parisian restaurant, who neither speaks nor reads French, read out stentoriously the entire long menu in his best Arkansas accent, and {{occasionally}} interrupt himself to chortle at his own cleverness” and he particularly criticized Cybill Shepherd, stating, [...] "Cybill Shepherd, Mr B's inamorata, plays a poor little snotty rich girl with a notion of sophistication that is underpassed onIy by her acting ability. (I will not even sully my pen by making it describe her singing and dancing.) If it weren't for an asinine superciliousness radiating from her, Miss Shepherd would actually be pitiable, rather like a kid from an orphanage trying to play Noel Coward." ...|$|R

[...] Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide website opined that I'm Going to Tell You a Secret would find a divided audience and how one reacted to the documentary was a reflection of how one viewed Madonna. [...] "Fans like me {{will be able to}} essentially ignore the self-serving moments and enjoy the tour elements. We'll also like the glimpse behind the curtain at Madonna on the road," [...] he added.

500|$|The film {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} film critics. LaRue Cook of Entertainment Weekly graded the film with a [...] "D" [...] and wrote, [...] "what {{was once a}} fresh slice of teen comedy has become a slab of stale crudeness." [...] Scott Weinberg of Moviefone, in his negative review, found the film [...] "slightly more amusing to <b>sit</b> <b>through</b> than the two previous entries", in particular praising the Star Trek sexual roleplay scene as [...] "extremely effective." [...] DVD Talk's Jeffrey Robinson writes that [...] "if anything, it will bore you and leave you wondering why you wasted {{an hour and a}} half of your life." [...] Writing in JoBlo.com, Adam Quigley poked fun at the film's themes, declaring that [...] "if there's a lesson to be taken from these films, it's that women are objects, and should always be treated as such." [...] IGNs Hock Teh gave the film 5/10, writing that it [...] "stays very close to the American Pie formula," [...] while criticizing the story as [...] "devoid of anything remotely semi-compelling or even noteworthy." [...] Peter Hammond of Maxim describes American Pie Presents: Beta House as [...] "loaded with sex, laughs and raunchy fun," [...] writing that it [...] "may be the most outrageous slice of pie yet!" ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{felt that}} the {{reworking}} of Madonna's older hits like [...] "Into the Groove" [...] and [...] "Holiday" [...] gave them a campy, Eurotrash feel like the songs on Confessions on a Dance Floor; he added that [...] " [...] help give the disc a cohesive feel even if the live performance, like the album it's hawking, is kind of humorless.

[...] Sterdan from Jam! complimented the CD section of the release, saying that [...] "Thankfully, the CD takes up the slack, delivering more than an hour of newer fare like 'American Life' and 'Music', peppered with oldies like 'Vogue', 'Holiday' and 'Like a Prayer'. Next time Madonna wants to share a secret, she should just leave the cameras at home."
