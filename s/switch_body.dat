5000|$|As {{shown in}} the {{disassembly}} photo, the switch actuator pivots in two holes in {{the sides of the}} plastic <b>switch</b> <b>body.</b> An actuator bar slides in two grooves inside the actuator, pressed down by a compression spring into a notch in the common contact bar. The common contact bar is free to rock on a small diameter rod, welded to the common terminal. However, because of the pressure applied by the compression spring, the common contact bar will always be held against one of the two contacts.|$|E
40|$|A constant-frequency {{peak current}} mode {{synchronous}} step-down DC-DC controller integrated circuit {{has been designed}} with adaptive dead-time control. The adaptive dead-time control circuitry is implemented as digital delay-locked loop with digital counters as memory elements. In periodic steady state, the switch is controlled to turn on exactly when the body diode starts to conduct current. The conduction loss through MOSFET <b>switch</b> <b>body</b> diode is minimized. In spice simulation, this scheme increases the overall efficiency in low-voltage applications by up to 3 %. by Zhipeng Li. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the development and}} testing of a low-profile, high-voltage, spark-gap switch designed to be closely coupled with other components into an integrated high-energy pulsed-power source. The switch is designed to operate at 100 kV using SF 6 gas pressurized to less than 0. 7 MPa. The volume of the switch cavity region is less than 1. 5 cm 3, and the field stress along the gas-dielectric interface {{is as high as}} 130 kV/cm. The dielectric <b>switch</b> <b>body</b> has a low profile that is only I -cm tall at its greatest extent and nominally 2 -mm thick over most of its area. This design achieves a very low inductance of less than 5 nH, but results in field stresses exceeding 500 kV/cm in the dielectric material. Field modeling was done to determine the appropriate shape for the highly stressed insulator and electrodes, and special manufacturing techniques were employed to mitigate the usual mechanisms that induce breakdown and failure in solid dielectrics. Static breakdown tests verified that the switch operates satisfactorily at 100 kV levels. The unit has been characterized with different shaped electrodes having nominal gap spacings of 2. 0, 2. 5, and 3. 0 mm. The relationship between self-break voltage and operating pressure agrees well with published data on gas properties, accounting for the field enhancements of the electrode shapes being used. Capacitor discharge tests in a low inductance test fixture exhibited peak currents up to 25 kA with characteristic frequencies of the ringdown circuit ranging from 10 to 20 MHz. The ringdown waveforms and scaling of measured parameters agree well with circuit modeling of the switch and test fixture. Repetitive operation has been demonstrated at moderate rep-rates up to 15 Hz, limited by the power supply being used. Preliminary tests to evaluate lifetime of the compact switch assembly have been encouraging. In one case, after more than 7, 000 high-current ringdown tests with approximately 30 C of total charge transferred, the switch continued to operate satisfactorily with no apparent tracking or deterioration of the insulator...|$|E
