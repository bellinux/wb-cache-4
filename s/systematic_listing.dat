Linear sequences of families are required for herbarium curators who wish to arrange collections systematically rather than alphabetically, and there are currently a wide range of systems in use. Over time, in most herbaria, as the understanding of rela-tionships changed, these classifications have become outdated and no longer represent the best estimate of relationships.

40|$|Abstract Background CCCH type {{zinc finger}} {{proteins}} are RNA binding proteins with regulatory functions at {{all stages of}} mRNA metabolism. The best-characterized member, tritetraproline (TTP), binds to AU rich elements in 3 ' UTRs of unstable mRNAs, mediating their degradation. In kinetoplastids, CCCH type zinc finger proteins {{have been identified as}} being involved in the regulation of the life cycle and possibly the cell cycle. To date, no <b>systematic</b> <b>listing</b> of CCCH proteins in kinetoplastids is available. Results We have identified the complete set of CCCH type zinc finger proteins in the available genomes of the kinetoplastid protozoa Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania major. One fifths (20 %) of all CCCH motifs fall into non-conventional classes and many had not been previously identified. One third of all CCCH proteins have more than one CCCH motif, suggesting multivalent RNA binding. One third have additional recognizable domains. The vast majority are unique to Kinetoplastida or to a subgroup within. Two exceptions are of interest: the putative orthologue of the mRNA nuclear export factor Mex 67 and a 3 '- 5 ' exoribonuclease restricted to Leishmania species. CCCH motifs are absent from these proteins in other organisms and might be unique, novel features of the Kinetoplastida homologues. Of the others, several have a predicted, and in one case experimentally confirmed, connection to the ubiquitination pathways, for instance a HECT-type E 3 ubiquitin ligase. The total number of kinetoplastid CCCH proteins is similar to the number in higher eukaryotes but lower than in yeast. A comparison of the genomic loci between the Trypanosomatidae homologues provides insight into both the evolution of the CCCH proteins as well as the CCCH motifs. Conclusion This study provides the first <b>systematic</b> <b>listing</b> of the Kinetoplastida CCCH proteins.

In addition, following the emergence of deep learning techniques, we systematically evaluate recent deep learning settings that are useful for developing a robust deep model for aesthetic scoring. Experiments are conducted using simple yet solid baselines that are competitive with the current state-of-the-arts. Moreover, we discuss the possibility of manipulating the aesthetics of images through computational approaches. We hope that our survey could serve as a comprehensive reference source for future research on the study of image aesthetic assessment...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach – Contemporary and highly aggregated back-bone data have been analyzed regarding consistency of network and transport layer headers (i. e. IP, TCP, UDP and ICMP). Possible security implications of each anomaly observed are discussed. Findings – A <b>systematic</b> <b>listing</b> of packet header anomalies, together with their frequencies as seen “in the wild”, is provided. Inconsistencies in protocol headers have been found within almost every aspect analyzed, including incorrect or incomplete series of IP fragments, IP address anomalies {{and other kinds of}} header fields not following internet standards. Internet traffic was shown to contain many erroneous packets; some are the result of software and hardware errors, others the result of intentional and malicious activities. Practical implications – The study not only presents occurrences of header anomalies as observed in today's internet traffic, but also provides detailed discussions about possible causes for the inconsistencies and their security implications for networked devices. Originality/value – The results are relevant for researchers as well as practitioners, and form a valuable input for intrusion detection systems, firewalls and the design of all kinds of networked applications exposed to network attacks...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} use {{heuristics}} to solve non-routine problems {{has been one of}} the important aims of the Singapore mathematics curriculum for the past fifteen years. Mathematics teachers are expected to teach their pupils how to use several heuristics listed in the curriculum documents to solve problems. In order to achieve this aim, the teacher needs information about which heuristics pupils are likely to be able to use to successfully solve various types of problems. The project, “Developing the Repertoire of Heuristics for Mathematical Problem Solving”, funded by CRPP, aims to provide the relevant information to teachers so that they can effectively plan their lessons. In April 2004, a sample of P 5 pupils from three primary schools and S 1 pupils from two secondary schools completed a problem solving exercise consisting of nine different types of questions. Four months later, they took a parallel posttest. The different heuristics they used to solve these questions and their success in solving them were analysed. This paper discusses the findings about two of these questions which involve the use of five different heuristics: <b>systematic</b> <b>listing,</b> guess and check, equations, logical argument, and diagrams. Further work will include a compilation of the heuristics used and the difficulties encountered by the pupils in solving the problems. The teachers should find this information useful in planning lessons that address the diversity of pupil responses to solving various types of mathematics problems...|$|E

The bibliographic control project is very important, fundamental, and indispensable in Africa. Fourie and Burger (2007) have observed that countries like South Africa have put forward efforts currently unmatchable by any African country. The fact that a book is recorded in the library, internet, or the information centre is enough to give hope to the needful potential user that {{it may be possible to}} access and use it.

Bibliographic control has become a major determinant of book accessibility and utilization and a key factor to information search. In many countries of the world, individuals are the chief initiators of this project and because of its place in enlightened societies, nations and international bodies have tackled this problem with all seriousness it deserves. UNESCO, for instance, has taken the bull by the horn and even formed other sub-bodies such as universal availability of publications, (UAP); universal availability of information (UAI) among others, to tackle the problem of universal bibliographic control (UBC) and Africa is not left out.

One current type of bibliography, according to World Book Encyclopedia (2002) presents a systematic description of books as well as list them, summarizing what each book is about as well as its currency, binding publisher and its value. When each country seriously undertakes this task of ensuring that every book is captured under this scheme, it becomes a national bibliography; and the collective effort by various nations of the universe is the UBC. The efforts put up by individual countries in Africa will be the focus of this work. The author will consider this article under the following headings: a} Bibliographic control activities on Africa c} Problems with the compilation of Bibliographies in Africa d} Ways of enhancing Universal Bibliographic Control in Africa Bibliographic control activities on Africa Bibliographic control activities have generally developed in Africa randomly over the years. A few African countries are lucky to have gotten retrospective national bibliographies before 1940, and it was individuals who made personal effort to compile national bibliographies for these countries. According to Musiker (2005) Mendelssohn’s South African Bibliography was published in 1910 making South Africa the first African country to have a national bibliography. This was the conceit effort made by South African Librarians towards the attainment of universal bibliographic control According to Aje (1977 : 16 (3), Sierra Leone was the first West African country to have a national bibliography. It was compiled by Sir Harry Charles Luke and published in 1925. H. C. Luke was a colonial secretary for Sierra Leone and apparently had searched important libraries in London and the secretariat library in Freetown and came out with his work entitled “A Bibliography of Sierra Leone” Another individual named Cardinell, (Aje 1977; 21 (7)) concentrated on Ghana for a national retrospective bibliography, entitled “A Bibliography of the Gold Coast 1496 - 1931 ” published in 1932. Sources of his information are said to be 19 th century work was pioneered by the Basel mission who set up printing and publishing enterprise in the field of religious publications. On the government side where activities commenced earlier than the Bassel Mission, Cardinell recorded that government printing press started functioning after 1875, producing government gazettes and reports. Thus, the first listing of government publication was part of the colonial report on the Gold Coast. All these were precursors of the monumental work produced by A. W. Cardinell. A UNESCO document by Beaudiquez (1977 : 99) also named Burundi as another country with retrospective national bibliography compiled by individual effort. Daniel Nyambarize, librarian at Universite du Burundi institute universitaire des sciences de L’ Education centre Recherche’s et de Documentation, pedagogique, compiled a bibliography “Le Burundi: essai d” une bibliographic 1959 – 1973. This was a list of publications, research reports and periodicals published between 1959 and 1973 and held in Burundi National Library. The UNESCO document by Beaudiquez (1977 : 419) states further that Benin Republic is another country with retrospective national bibliography compiled by an individual called Guillaume Da Silva. It was published by the Institute de Recherche Applique es du Benin (IRAB). No date of publication was given by this source. Other African countries with retrospective national bibliographies by individuals include Chad (1968); Costa Rice (1958); Guinea (1964); Ivory Coast (1972 - 1974); Libya (1951 - 1971); Madagascar (1952); Morocco (1970); South Africa (1910) and Zambia (no date). These retrospective bibliographies are attempts to compile all the works published in these individual countries. A close look at this same UNESCO document (1977 : 419) shows that eighteen (18) other African countries, apart from the thirteen (13) mentioned here have national bibliographies compiled by depository centers. And some of these countries have legal deposit decrees backing them up from the central government. These show a great progress made in the development of Africa’s Continental Bibliography. Another study by Samuel Kotie (1971 : 14), on the development of library studies, University of Ghana identified thirty two current national bibliographies for African countries by 1969. Whereas, at the time the International Conference on African Bibliography (1970 : 1) was held in Nairobi, Kenya from December 4 - 8, 1967, only nine African countries were listed as having national bibliographies in the true sense of the word. These include, Ethiopia Madagascar, Malawi, Nigeria, Rhodesia, Senegal, South Africa, Sierra Leone and Tanzania. Another writer on bibliography, Amosu (1968 : 14 - 18), explained the issue of the availability of bibliographies of all types on Africa subject and national bibliographies produced on Africa. She also explored methods of bibliographic control of materials on Africa, the problem of coordination for complete coverage and avoidance of serious duplication amongst other considerations. In Nigeria, the National Library of Nigeria has been charged with these responsibilities of compiling; coordinating and publishing the bibliography of all published materials on Nigeria...|$|E
