50|$|Noise-related {{causes of}} hearing loss {{are divided into}} {{extrinsic}} (nosocusis) and intrinsic (<b>sociocusis)</b> causes: In the auditory system, the extrinsic component (nosocusis) includes hearing loss due to otologic disease, hazardous noise exposure, acoustic trauma, and ototoxic agents. The intrinsic component (<b>sociocusis)</b> indicates the wear-and-tear effects {{of exposure to the}} everyday sounds of normal living. People who live in nonindustrialized regions avoid both nosocusis and <b>sociocusis</b> and demonstrate excellent hearing into old age.|$|E
50|$|The {{aging process}} has three {{distinct}} components: physiologic degeneration, extrinsic damage (nosocusis), and intrinsic damage (<b>sociocusis).</b> These factors are superimposed on a genetic substrate, {{and may be}} overshadowed by general age-related susceptibility to diseases and disorders.|$|E
50|$|Hearing loss is only weakly {{correlated}} with age. In preindustrial and non-industrial societies, persons retain their hearing into old age. In the Framingham Cohort Study, only 10% {{of the variability}} of hearing with age {{could be explained by}} age-related physiologic deterioration. Within family groups, heredity factors were dominant; across family groups, other, presumably <b>sociocusis</b> and nosocusis factors were dominant.|$|E
50|$|Presbycusis (also spelled presbyacusis, from Greek presbys “old” + akousis “hearing”), or age-related hearing loss, is the {{cumulative}} effect of aging on hearing. It is a progressive and irreversible bilateral symmetrical age-related sensorineural hearing loss resulting from degeneration of the cochlea or associated structures of the inner ear or auditory nerves. The hearing loss is most marked at higher frequencies. Hearing loss that accumulates with age but is caused by factors other than normal aging (nosocusis and <b>sociocusis)</b> is not presbycusis, although differentiating the individual effects of multiple causes of hearing loss can be difficult.|$|E
40|$|The {{establishment}} of a baseline of normal hearing is investigated through the examination of pure tone hearing level surveys and variables such as age, <b>sociocusis,</b> sex, race, and otological disorders. Mathematical formulae used to predict hearing levels in industrial and nonindustrial surveys is included...|$|E
