In this report we present an assessment of public health strategies designed to tackle behavioural risk factors for chronic diseases that are closely linked with obesity, including aspects of diet and physical inactivity, in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa. England was included for comparative purposes. Several population-based prevention policies can be expected to generate substantial health gains while entirely or largely paying for themselves through future reductions of health-care expenditures. These strategies include health information and communication strategies that improve population awareness about the benefits of healthy eating and physical activity; fiscal measures that increase the price of unhealthy food content or reduce the cost of healthy foods rich in fibre; and regulatory measures that improve nutritional information or restrict the marketing of unhealthy foods to children. A package of measures for the prevention of chronic diseases would deliver substantial health gains, with a very favourable cost-effectiveness profile...|$|R

40|$|From the {{previous}} analysis {{it could be}} seen how different the types <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> Estonian population are by socio-demographic indicators, living conditions and attitudes. The basis of preparing typology <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> was the questionnaire conducted {{by the department of}} journalism and communication of Tartu University in December 2002 „Me. World. Media. “ In formation of types data analysis package SPSS was used and frequency in doing different things was originated from. In order to explain leisure time orientations of Estonian population, factor analysis was conducted first and then cluster analysis was conducted by means of K-average method. By twenty-nine traits, eight groups were differentiated, which can be handled as typology <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> Estonian population. Based on activeness of different activities in different fields of activity, the first five types can be classified types <b>of</b> active <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> but last three types <b>of</b> passive <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Types <b>of</b> active <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> can be generally divided into two by their variety of interests. The first group is formed by people whose circle of interests is very wide: diversely active and work oriented, cultural <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> The second group is formed by people of particular interests and hobbies: hazardous, entertaining; technical amateur and <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> new media and oriented to social life. The first group is characterised by optimistic attitude, they value self-assurance and personal and social balance. They have moved around Estonia and also abroad very much, they are open to other cultures, interested in the news of other countries, they can and use actively foreign languages. Diversely active and work oriented cultural <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is oriented to improving the environment. More than one third of them live in new or houses that have been renovated during the last decade, 60 % own the car. They have a strong or very strong consumerist attitude and they are not indifferent concerning consumption. Compared to other <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> they have significantly more communicational technology than cultural properties at home. If there are more or less equal number {{of men and women in}} active <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> then women make up two-thirds of work-oriented cultural. The latter <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is also more characteristic of middle-aged people with higher education who are wealthier than active <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Relatively less optimistic attitude is characteristic <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> with certain specific interests compared to aforementioned active <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> but it cannot be said either that they have pessimistic attitude towards life. They can rather not foresee the future or they think that nothing will change. All the individuals belonging here value self-assurance, for hazardous, entertaining and new media <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> oriented to social life, being materially insured is very important. Active <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> observed are relatively mobile but if hazardous, entertaining type <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> prefers to move around in foreign countries more than in Estonia, then in case <b>of</b> new media, <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> with social orientation has the opposite case. Among the given active <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> there are relatively indifferent people concerning consumption but also relatively many of those who are not indifferent to any product or service. For them, having communicational technology is much more important than furnishing home in one’s own way or having domestic appliances and cultural properties. If hazardous, entertaining <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> with technical hobbies is mostly formed by male persons, then for new media <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> with social orientation, percentage of men and women is more or less equal. The last type is foremost characteristic of younger persons aged under 20 years, hazardous, entertaining <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is characteristic <b>of</b> 20 - 30 -aged persons and technically recreational <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is characteristic <b>of</b> middle-aged persons. Technically recreational <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is the wealthiest compared to all the other <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and owns significantly more immovable property, there is also majority of car owners among them (76 %). The types <b>of</b> passive <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> are characterised by relatively pessimistic attitude towards life, for them, the most important value is emotional balance opposing to self- assurance. The range of interests of passive types is also passive and the most important form of entertainment is watching TV. Their life is mostly centered around their home environment. If domesticated traditional type <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is mostly characterised by certain practical activeness in domestic household, then literally bound, traditional and passive <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is characteristic <b>of</b> homely passive activities. Their mobility within Estonia and outside it is less than average, skills in foreign languages and extent of their use is very low. Types <b>of</b> passive <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> are not financially very wealthy, their income mostly remains under 2500 kroons per member in family. Most of them also do not have consumerist attitude towards life and they are relatively indifferent to consumption. For them spending money on different products, services and leisure time activities and purchasing domestic and communicational technology is not that relevant. Individuals belonging to this group are not indifferent to owning cultural properties. All the types <b>of</b> passive <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> are more characteristic of older females, literal, traditional <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is also characteristic of more Russian speaking population. While observing the use of media by Estonian population, it turned out that within last 12 - 13 years, use of printed media has decreased and use of electronic media has increased. Reading newspapers is most differentiated by nationality, education and income – Estonians, people with higher education and income are more active newspaper readers. Reading magazines, listening to the radio and watching TV are most differentiated by nationality and age. If Estonians are more actively following the printed media compared to non-Estonians and they are characteristic of stronger traditions of listening to the radio, then non-Estonians watch TV more often than Estonians. Following electronic media is more characteristic of older people while printed media is more actively followed by young people. While observing the use of media among the types <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> it turned out that activeness in the use of media is also related to activeness in different fields of activity. The range of interests and activities of active users of media is wider, they are more mobile, open to other cultures and developments, more enterprising and active in consumption. The representatives <b>of</b> more active <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> use significantly more Internet and read Internet publications but none <b>of</b> types <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is clearly oriented to consuming new media only, it is rather supplement to the use of traditional media. At the same time, listening to the radio and watching TV is equal in all the types <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> (excl. work-oriented cultural <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life).</b> It seems that traditional electronic media forms the environment where all the people meet, irrespective of their interests or socio- demographic indicators. To sum up, change in Estonian society has also brought along changes in <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Fast development <b>of</b> media environment, especially new media and spreading of western consumption culture are the basis for a new <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> to emerge. Besides new types <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> specific to new society, some types <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> common in Soviet times have remained but their content has changed. The dominant feature in traditional <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is not relationships between people, even-temperedness, material wealth, satisfaction with one’s life and environment, but relatively pessimistic attitude, passivity, home orientation and little financial wealth. The relationship between working activity and cultural consumption has also changed significantly as the dominant <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> As the purpose of this Master’s thesis was to study <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> people – relationships, attitudes and behaviour common in society – leaving behind lifestyle – studying subjective individuality of individuals, then the type <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and the factors forming the type of personality could also be studied in the future and also their interconnections. Typological analysis could be complemented by qualitative research methods and analysis of single cases – long-term observations, in-depth interviews and other should be arranged. It should be definitely exciting to study the lifestyle by definition of Bourdieu lifestyle and habitus. While analysing taste preferences and behaviour of individuals in relationships with others and through that relationship it would definitely help to get closer to the real behaviour of people, formation of their attitudes and values. As this paper has focused primarily on the analysis <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> Estonian population and in case <b>of</b> typology <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> Estonians, only features forming the types and socio-demographic indicators have been observed, in-depth analysis <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> Estonians should be analysed in the future. This approach would more clearly enable to bring out changes in <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and make more certain and more causal conclusions. Also, problems <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> should be one direction of research in modern research companies. Being aware of the nature <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> its changing speed and factors, changing tendencies <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> can also be foreseen, subjective needs and consumption orientations of individuals can be predicted and social policy and economic policy and other can be planned...|$|R

The Neolithic farmer-herders in the Fayum relied heavily on hunting and fishing, which had been the major subsistence activities since the Epipalaeolithic period. There are no remains of substantial dwellings to indicate that these farmer-herders lived a <b>sedentary</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Previous researchers have thus asserted that the Fayum people were nomadic and moved seasonally. Lithic evidence obtained through new research suggests that the Fayum people were not nomadic but were tethered to lakeshores. The introduction of farming and herding would not have taken place in the Fayum without a lakeshore-tethered if not fully <b>sedentary</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> But the success of a farming-herding way of life in the Fayum {{would not have been possible}} without the reorganisation of mobility, which led to decreased moves of residential bases and increased logistical moves of individuals. Lithic evidence also suggests that the Fayum people kept exerting special efforts to make farming and herding a reliable subsistence and to maximise the yield. The introduction of farming and herding in the Fayum would have been a solution to mitigate growing population/resource imbalances when the climate became drier and more people had to aggregate around permanent water sources in the 6 th millennium cal.

First coined by Zhuangzi in the late 4th century BC, it was used to describe a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> different from that of being actively involved in politics. At the time, it referred to the <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> underachieving or maligned scholar-officials who distanced themselves from the circles of political power. In this sense, jianghu could be loosely interpreted as the <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> a hermit.|$|R
