They were subsequently charged and convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The LaGrands were German nationals, having been born from a German mother in Germany. While they had both lived in the United States since they were four and five, respectively, neither had officially obtained U.S. citizenship. As foreigners the LaGrands should have been informed of their right to consular assistance, under the Vienna Convention, from their <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>nationality,</b> Germany. However the Arizona authorities failed to do this even after they became aware that the LaGrands were German nationals. The LaGrand brothers later contacted the German consulate of their own accord, having learned of their right to consular assistance. They appealed their sentences and convictions {{on the grounds that they}} were not informed of their right to consular assistance, and that with consular assistance they might have been able to mount a better defense. The federal courts rejected their argument on grounds of procedural default, which provides that issues cannot be raised in federal court appeals unless they have first been raised in state courts.|$|E

5000|$|Singh was a British citizen. He {{had married}} an Indian citizen {{who was then}} living in India. He wanted her {{to live with him}} in the UK. He was unable to satisfy the {{domestic}} UK immigration requirements to sponsor a visa for his foreign spouse. He then decided to make use of EU free movement rules to solve this problem. Under EU law Art 3(1) of the Citizens' Rights Directive, a Union citizen has the right to move to a Member State other than that of his nationality, and has the right to bring certain family members, including his non-EU national spouse, with him when he does so. Singh therefore moved to Germany temporarily, and his spouse was granted a German residence permit. The couple then sought to move to the UK, arguing that Mrs Singh had a retained right of residence in the EU stemming from her status as the spouse of an EU citizen returning from another Member State to his Member <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>nationality.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{convention}} {{has only}} been ratified by three states (France, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) and signed by another two (Austria and Portugal). [...] As such, international divorce cases that take place outside of {{the authority of the}} convention are not clear-cut. For instance, questions arise when assets are held in trust in a country that neither spouse has an actual connection to through residence or nationality and neither the state in which the trust is located nor the state in which suit is brought (the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> or residence) {{is a member of the}} Convention. Some courts have found ways around the jurisdictional issue at hand (i.e. that they have no jurisdiction in another country) especially if the assets are marital and under the control of only one spouse. Such was the case in the New York case of Riechers v. Riechers. In this case the husband had used marital assets to fund a Cook Islands trust; even though the New York court had no jurisdiction over the trust money, they ordered the wife’s share of that money paid from other assets.|$|E

5000|$|As {{difficult}} {{as it can be}} to prove why an actor did act in a certain way, it is exponentially more difficult to prove why it did not act. For this reason, the necessity of demonstrating that a behavior was prompted by a sense of legal obligation makes it particularly difficult for customary international law to develop around the prohibition of a practice. One important case in the development of modern customary international law theory is the Lotus case, in which France attempted to protest Turkey's assertion of criminal jurisdiction over a French citizen for acts committed on the high seas (outside of Turkey's territory). France presented a number of historical examples to demonstrate that the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> or the state whose flag the ship had flown had exclusive jurisdiction in cases such as this. However, the Permanent Court of International Justice (a precursor to the ICJ) declared that the evidence showed merely that [...] "States had often, in practice, abstained from instituting criminal proceedings, and not that they recognized themselves as being obliged to do so; for only if such abstention were based on their being conscious of having a duty to abstain would it be possible to speak of an international custom." [...] This reasoning was cited approvingly in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases, which similarly declined to find the existence of customary law regarding the proper method to delimit territorial claims to the continental shelf extending from the coastline of states bordering the North Sea. [...] The ICJ also declined to find evidence of customary international law in an opinion on the legality of the use or threat of nuclear weapons, despite what some argued to be uniform state practice. As in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases, it found that the mere fact that no state had used nuclear weapons against another state since World War II did not reflect opinio juris. Some states had pointed out that a series of U.N. resolutions had been issued [...] "that deal with nuclear weapons and that affirm, with consistent regularity, the illegality of nuclear weapons," [...] and argued that this signified “the existence of a rule of international customary law which prohibits recourse to those weapons.” [...] Nonetheless, the ICJ wrote that states possessing nuclear weapons had almost always objected to these resolutions, which strongly suggests that those states did not believe that a customary law prohibiting their use existed. Moreover, it wrote that the non-use of nuclear weapons could actually provide evidence of their [...] "use" [...] as a deterrent force.|$|E
40|$|Individuals whose {{international}} (human) {{rights are}} violated outside their <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> often have very limited means to address such violations. For instance, the foreign nationals detained by the United States in Guantanamo Bay {{have been unable}} to improve their situation themselves.

This mechanism has been subject to debate and criticism in recent years because of its (alleged) state-centred and its discretionary nature. Through an analysis of the nature of diplomatic protection, in particular the legal fiction, the modalities of its exercise and its relation to the general law of state responsibility, and its application in international and national practice the position of diplomatic protection in current international law is defined and the question of whether it is an appropriate mechanism for the protection of individual (human) rights is answered positively.

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the special nature of the {{worldwide}} protection of EU citizens through the diplomatic and consular agents of EU Member States.

Several issues are highlighted in this study: for instance, the differences of this new system of protection with respect to the classical “diplomatic” and “consular protection” of the international law, the attempts to diminish the importance of the fundamental right to protection of the EU citizen, the differences with the “EU civil protection” and with intergovernmental instruments such as the EU crisis management...|$|E

40|$|Citizenship as a {{relationship}} <b>of</b> individual and <b>State</b> developed in Europe {{at the end}} of 18 century. There is a controversy in the doctrine whether it is an institution of international or internal law. I general two aspects of the institution can be differentiated — citizenship in a sphere of internal law and nationality in the sphere of international law. A general principle was adopted in international practice that each state can freely regulate its <b>nationality,</b> the liberty <b>of</b> that regulation is however limited by international law, especially by customary norms. Existence <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> is not related to passing a relevant act of internal law by a State nor is the method of regulation adopted in a given State significant. In practice there are two basic means formed <b>of</b> acquisition <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> at a moment of birth: according to ius soli or ius sanguinis. A possibility of naturalization is also warranted by respective legal systems, while acquisition and loss <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> by means <b>of</b> legal transactions of private law is of a slight importance. Basic means of a loss <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> are: renouncement and- in exceptional, precisely defined situations in internal law <b>of</b> respective <b>states</b> deprivation <b>of</b> <b>nationality.</b> Application <b>of</b> those institutions can presently be limited by provisions of international law concerning protection of human rights and and precluding cases <b>of</b> dual <b>nationality</b> and statelessness. Nationality is an individual status. Change <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> related to change of sovereign <b>of</b> a given <b>State</b> (succession <b>of</b> <b>states)</b> is <b>of</b> an exceptional character. There was a principle developed in practice that persons inhabiting an area which is changing its sovereign and possessing <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> his predecessor are automatically loosing their previous nationality and acquiring the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> the successor. A duty to guarantee the option is not adoptod in modern international law. Conflicts <b>of</b> legislations on <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> many <b>states</b> can result in dual nationality or statelessness. Presently actions are undertaken in order to eliminate those situations and diminish their effects. In practice, a person posessing a dual nationality is treated by the third state as a national <b>of</b> one <b>state</b> only. Stateless persons are granted a minimum standard of treatment by the international agreements. The international practice, especially the ICJ decision in the case of Nottebohm confirmed the existence of customary norm providing that an effective relation of an individuai and a State is a prerequisite of effective acquisition <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> by persons nationals <b>of</b> only one <b>state.</b> That requirement is to preclude fictitious granting <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> and to secure international community against infringement of international law and abuse <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> for illegal goals.

40|$|The {{argument}} {{of this paper}} is that several empirical puzzles in the citizenship literature are rooted in the failure to distinguish between the mainly legal concept <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> and the broader, political concept of citizenship. Using this distinction, the paper analysis the evolution of German and American nationality laws over the last 200 years. The historical development of both legal structures shows strong communalities. With the emergence of the modern system <b>of</b> nation <b>states,</b> the attribution <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> to newborn children is ascribed either via the principle of descent or place of birth. With regard to the naturalization of adults, there is an increasing ethnization of law, which means that the increasing complexities of naturalization criteria are more and more structured along ethnic ideas.
