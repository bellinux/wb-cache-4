50|$|Hydrous {{forms of}} SnO2 have been {{described}} as <b>stannic</b> <b>acid.</b> Such materials appear to be hydrated particles of SnO2 where the composition reflects the particle size.|$|E
5000|$|For glaze {{use only}} one tin compound, tin (IV) oxide Tin dioxide (SnO2), and also called <b>stannic</b> <b>acid,</b> is commercially exploited. Opacity is {{produced}} in glazes {{by the addition of}} some substance to scatter and reflect some of the incident light.|$|E
5000|$|In {{chemistry}} {{the term}} stannate refers to compounds of tin (Sn). <b>Stannic</b> <b>acid</b> (Sn(OH)4), the formal precursor to stannates, {{does not exist}} and is actually a hydrate of SnO2. The term is also used in naming conventions as a suffix for example the hexachlorostannate ion is SnCl62−.|$|E
5000|$|The Prins-pinacol {{reaction}} is a cascade reaction of a Prins reaction and a pinacol rearrangement. The carbonyl {{group in the}} reactant in scheme 8 is masked as a dimethyl acetal and the hydroxyl group is masked as a triisopropylsilyl ether (TIPS). With lewis <b>acid</b> <b>stannic</b> chloride the oxonium ion is activated and the pinacol rearrangement of the resulting Prins intermediate results in ring contraction and referral of the positive charge to the TIPS ether which eventually forms an aldehyde group in the final product as a mixture of cis and trans isomers with modest diastereoselectivity.|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{of a new}} class of 1, 3 -thiazolidine nucleoside analogues in which furanose oxygen atom was replaced with nitrogen atom and T-carbon atom with sulfur atom is described. N-tert-butoxycarbonyl- 2 -acyloxy- 4 -trityloxymethyl- 1, 3 -thiazolidine was coupled with the pyrimidine bases like uracil, thymine, etc. in the presence of lewis <b>acids</b> <b>stannic</b> chloride or trimethyl silyl triflate following Vorbruggen procedure. The antibacterial activity of the novel 1, 3 -thiazolidine pyrimidine nucleoside analogues is highlighted. All compounds (7 a-e) with free NH group in the pyrimidine moiety showed significant biological activity against all the standard strains used and in that compounds 7 d and 7 e showed significant activity against 14 human pathogens tested.

40|$|In {{the search}} for effective, selective, and {{nontoxic}} antiviral and antitumor agents, a variety of strategies have been devised to design nucleoside analogues. Here we have described the versatile synthesis of beta-L- 1, 3 -thiazolidine nucleoside analogues. These analogues are all derived from the key stereochemically defined intermediate N-tert-butoxy-carbonyt- 4 -hydroxymethyl- 1, 3 -thiazolidine- 2 -ol which was accessible in 57 % yield starting from L-Cysteine methylester hydrochloride. N-tert-butoxycarbonyl- 2 -acyloxy- 4 -trityloxymethyl- 1, 3 -thiazolidine was coupled with the pyrimidine bases {{in the presence of}} Lewis <b>acids</b> <b>stannic</b> chloride or trimethyl silyl triflate following Vorbruggen procedure. Proof of the structure and configuration was obtained through H- 1 NMR, C- 13 NMR, Mass, elemental analysis and NOE experiments. Docking and antitumor activity of these nucleoside analogues are also reported...|$|R
50|$|Tin {{can form}} many oxides, sulfides, and other chalcogenide derivatives. The dioxide SnO2 (cassiterite) forms when tin is heated in the {{presence}} of air. SnO2 is amphoteric, which means that it dissolves in both acidic and basic solutions. Stannates with the structure Sn(OH)62−, like K2Sn(OH)6, are also known, though the free <b>stannic</b> <b>acid</b> H2Sn(OH)6 is unknown.|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{investigation}} was to determine whether it is plausible for bacterial AI- 2 quorum sensing to be selectively regulated by environmentally available oxoacids. In particular, we investigated the ability of H 2 CO 3 and H 4 SiO 4 to bind molecules structurally analogous to the AI- 2 signaling compound (a hydration product of (4 S) - 4, 5 -dihydroxy- 2, 3 -pentanedione, S-DPD) which is known to be bound to H 3 BO 3 in the AI- 2 receptor site of V. harveyi. We report the first ever evidence of mono- and di-ester linked complexes formed spontaneously between carbonic acid and aqueous polyhydroxy hydrocarbons, providing support for the hypothesis that a complex between H 2 CO 3 and some S-DPD derivative regulates AI- 2 quorum sensing in S. gordonii. The carbonate centre in these novel complexes retains three-fold coordination. Additionally, we compared the binding affinity of silicic acid to that of boric acid and carbonic acid to several different alcohols and saccharides, and determined that the formation constants generally increase as H 2 CO 3 < H 4 SiO 4 < H 3 BO 3. It seems entirely plausible, therefore, that silicic acid could modulate AI- 2 quorum sensing in Sirich environments such as soil solutions. Finally, we determined that <b>stannic</b> <b>acid</b> is also complexed by a range of polyhydroxy hydrocarbons in aqueous solution and characterized of structures of many of the resulting mono-, bis- and tris-ligand complexes...|$|E
40|$|By using a megacycle-frequency {{oscillator}} {{to follow}} the reaction, the Lewis <b>acid,</b> <b>stannic</b> chloride, can be titrated with nitrogen bases in acetonitrile as solvent and with oxygen bases in benzene as solvent with an error of 0. 5 - 4 %; reverse-order titrations were equally successful. The characteristic maxima and minima in the titration curves indicate that in acetonitrile stannic chloride probably forms AB, A 3 B 4 and A 4 B 3 adducts with piperidine, and AB and A 4 B 3 adducts with pyridine; no adduct was indicated for diphenylamine. In benzene solution, stannic chloride forms (a) AB 2 adducts with MeOH, EtOH, n-PrOH, iso-PrOH, n-BuOH, sec. -BuOH and iso-BuOH, (b) AB and AB 2 adducts with acetone and tetrahydrofuran, and (c) an AB adduct with dioxane; the stoichiometry {{for a group of}} ethers is less decisive. The presence of the 1 : 1 tetrahydrofuran-stannic chloride adduct in benzene supports the belief that pentacoordinate tin exists in certain adducts with oxygen bases. The megacycle-frequency oscillator was also applied to the estimation of the relative base strength of Lewis bases toward a given Lewis acid by assuming that the instrument response increase, as an ether or alcohol was added to stannic chloride in benzene, is due to the formation of the new coordinate bond. Agreement of the data obtained with the limited existing data on relative base strengths of ethers is good in those cases where comparable steric factors are involved...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the synthesis of}} highly substituted geminally difluorinated cyclohexenols based on Diels-Alder reactions between a difluorinated dienophile and furans (furan, 2 -methyl and 2, 3 -dimenthyl) in presence of stannic chloride. The dienophile was synthesised in two different ways: a literature procedure, starting from the commercially available trifluoroethanol and new route involving an organometallic reagent.;Sulphur electrophile chemistry applied to the endo and exo cycloadducts gained stereo- and regio- control completely. Full protection of the free hydroxyl group was required before two different ring-opening strategies could be implemented: a carbanionic and a reductive method were attempted to ring-open the 7 -oxabicyclo[2. 2. 1]heptenyl system. The scope of these methodologies was investigated with furan, 2 -methyl and 2, 3 -dimethyl furan cycloadducts. When a stoichiometric amount of the Lewis <b>acid</b> (<b>stannic</b> chloride) {{was used in the}} cycloaddition with furan, an interesting bicyclic carbonate was afforded. To understand the mechanism of the reaction {{and the role of the}} Lewis acid in binding the cycloadduct, crystals were grown and an interesting complex was obtained.;Useful vinyl bromide products (endo and carbonate) were generated by cycloaddition between the difluorinated alkenoate and 3 -bromofuran in the presence of 1. 0 equivalents of tin tetrachloride. Suzuki coupling reaction of endoadduct with phenylboronic acid was carried out under Leadbeater's aqueous microwave conditions. Finally, dihydroxylation of the ring opened products and deprotections of the protected hydroxyl groups delivered the required gem- difluorinated polyhydroxy cyclohexane allowing for the first time the synthesis of cyclitol analogues via Diels-Alder reaction...|$|R
