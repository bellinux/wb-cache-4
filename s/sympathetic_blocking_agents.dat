40|$|Treatment of {{hypertension}} with <b>sympathetic</b> <b>blocking</b> <b>agents</b> may convert latent cardiac failure into overt failure. Detection of early cardiac insufficiency is desirable. Thirty patients with essential hypertension without history or symptoms of circulatory decompensation were investigated. According {{to the changes}} induced by digitalis on the left ventricular mean rates of systolic ejection and isovolumic pressure development, they were divided into 2 groups: group I (non-responders), and group II (responders to digitalis). Seventeen (II randomly selected from group I, and 6 from group II) had treatment with reserpine and guanethidine.

40|$|Bethanidine {{has been}} {{administered}} intra-arterially and intravenously into normotensive subjects {{and its effects}} on the limb blood vessels, arterial blood pressure, vascular sensitivity to noradrenaline and the degree and time course of sympathetic nerve blockade have been studied. The drug caused an initial constriction of hand and forearm vessels which is attributed to release of catechol amines since it is abolished by the prior administration of phenoxybenzamine. The constriction was followed by a sustained vasodilatation lasting between 5 and 20 hr. Sympathetic blockade of hand vessels commenced immediately on infusion and was complete within 1 hr of administration. Recovery occurred in about 5 hr. Sensitivity to intra-arterial noradrenaline was increased within 10 to 15 min of infusion and before sympathetic blockade was complete. Intravenous administration caused a slight rise in blood pressure of supine subjects. Baroreceptor reflex responses of heart and of limb vessels elicited by tilting the subject feet downwards were abolished by bethanidine and postural hypotension occurred.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of short-term adrenergic blockade on the rate of whole-body protein turnover and leucine oxidation, and on protein synthesis in specific tissues in male rats. Adrenergic blockade was induced by guanethidine (100 mg/kg body weight subcutaneously). The control group was treated with saline. On the second day, the parameters of whole-body protein and leucine metabolism were evaluated using a primed constant intravenous infusion of L-[1 – 14 C]leucine. Protein synthesis in tissues was determined on the basis of L-[1 – 14 C]leucine incorporation. Guanethidine treatment caused a decrease in norepinephrine in skeletal muscle. Whole-body leucine oxidation and leucine oxidized fraction were higher in guanethidine-treated rats. There was an insignificant effect of guanethidine on whole-body proteolysis, protein synthesis and leucine clearance. However, protein balance was negative due to the larger difference between protein synthesis and proteolysis in guanethidine-treated animals compared to controls. In guanethidine-treated rats, protein synthesis was higher in the gastrocnemius muscle and in the kidneys and lower in liver and spleen. Changes in the small intestine and colon were insignificant. In addition, a marked decrease in concentration of several amino acids has been observed in the liver, the kidneys and the spleen. It is concluded that adrenergic blockade induced by guanethidine is associated with significant changes in protein metabolism, leucine oxidation and amino acid concentrations in several tissues. The most important consequences of treatment are considered to be a negative effect on protein balance, increased protein turnover in skeletal muscle and kidneys and decreased protein synthesis in the liver and spleen. These changes may also be induced by administration of other <b>sympathetic</b> <b>blocking</b> <b>agents,</b> e. g. in treatment of hypertension...|$|E

Increased skin temperature and decreased sweating are used to identify the adequacy of <b>sympathetic</b> <b>block</b> in the upper limb after stellate ganglion block (SGB). Baroreflexes elicited by postural change induce a reduction in peripheral blood flow by causing sympathetic vasoconstriction. We hypothesized that <b>sympathetic</b> <b>block</b> in the upper limb reduces the decrease in finger blood flow caused by baroreflexes stimulated by postural change from the supine to long sitting position. This study evaluated if <b>sympathetic</b> <b>block</b> of the upper limb affects the change in finger blood flow resulting from postural change. If change in finger blood flow would be kept against postural changes, it has a potential to be a new indicator of sympathetic blockade in the upper limb. Methods: Subjects were adult patients who had a check-up at the Department of Pain Management in our university hospital over 2 years and 9 months from May 2012. We executed a total of 91 SGBs in nine patients (N= 9), which included those requiring treatment for pain associated with herpes zoster in seven of the patients, tinnitus in one patient and upper limb pain in one patient. We checked for the following four signs after performing SGB: Horner’s sign, brachial nerve blockade, finger blood flow measured by a laser blood flow meter and skin temperature of the thumb measured by thermography, before and after SGB in the supine position and immediately after adopting the long sitting position. Results: We executed a total of 91 SGBs in nine patients. Two SGBs were excluded from the analysis due to the absence of Horner’s sign. We divided 89 procedures into two groups according to elevation in skin temperature of the thumb: by over 1 °C (<b>sympathetic</b> <b>block</b> group, n= 62) and by < 1 °C (nonsympathetic block group, n= 27). Finger blood flow decreased significantly just after a change in posture from the supine to long sitting position after SGB in both groups. In the <b>sympathetic</b> <b>block</b> group, the ratio of finger blood flow in the long sitting position/supine position with a change in posture significantly increased after SGB compared with before SGB (before SGB: range 0. 09 – 0. 94, median 0. 53; after SGB: range 0. 33 – 1. 2, median 0. 89, p< 0. 0001). Conclusion: Our study shows that with <b>sympathetic</b> <b>block</b> in the upper limb, the ratio of finger blood flow significantly increases despite baroreflexes stimulated by postural change from the supine to long sitting position.

40|$|A study [1] {{based on}} {{temperature}} measurements {{has suggested that}} the extent of <b>sympathetic</b> <b>block</b> after spinal anaesthesia is greater than assumed previously and this has renewed interest in this area [2]. Based on loss of cold sensation, the traditional view is that the rostral level of <b>sympathetic</b> <b>block</b> extends two or more segments above the level of insensitivity to pinprick stimu-lation with spinal [3], but not with extradural anaesthesia [4].

The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect and mechanism of cervical <b>sympathetic</b> <b>block</b> on cerebral vasospasm of the rabbits after SAH. METHODS: After successful modeling of cervical <b>sympathetic</b> <b>block,</b> 18 healthy male white rabbits were randomly divided into three groups (n= 6), ie, sham operation group (Group A), SAH group (Group B) and SAH with cervical <b>sympathetic</b> <b>block</b> group (Group C). Models of delayed CVS were established by puncturing cisterna magna twice with an injection of autologous arterial blood in Groups B and C. A sham injection of blood through cisterna magna was made in Group A. 0. 5 ml saline was injected each time through a catheter for cervical <b>sympathetic</b> <b>block</b> after the first injection of blood three times a day for 3 d in Group B (bilateral alternating). 0. 5 ml of 0. 25 % bupivacaine was injected each time through a catheter for cervical <b>sympathetic</b> <b>block</b> after the first injection of blood three times a day for 7 d in Group B. 2 ml venous blood and cerebrospinal fluid were obtained before (T 1), 30 min (T 2) and 7 d (T 3) after the first injection of blood, respectively, and conserved in a low temperature refrigerator. Basilar artery value at T 1, T 2 and T 3 was measured via cerebral angiography. The degree of damage to nervous system at T 1 and T 3 was recorded. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in diameter of basilar artery at T 1 among three groups. The diameters of basilar artery at T 2 and T 3 of Groups B and C were all smaller than that in Group A, which was smaller than Group C, with a significant difference. There was no significant difference in NO and NOS in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid among three groups. The NO and NOS contents at T 2 and T 3 of Groups B and C were all lower than Group A; Group C was higher than Group B, with a significant difference. The nerve function at T 3 of Groups B and C were all lower than Group A and that of Group C higher than Group B, with a significant difference.
