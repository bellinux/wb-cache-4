40|$|The {{historical}} {{development of the}} law of companies shows that this area of the law is evolving and continually changing based on the level of economic development. The law directly dealing with companies, the 1960 Commercial Code of Ethiopia, seems to limit the scope {{of the law of}} companies only to private limited companies and share companies, save the partnerships included in the Code. This is a very narrow approach as it leaves out public enterprises simply because they are not recognized under the Code.

As such, the article vets the main features of private limited companies, share companies, public enterprises and The Ethiopia Commodity Exchange) ECX and shows how the advent of the ECX has challenged the frontiers of the existing legal framework of Ethiopian law of companies.

40|$|Purpose – Derivatives are {{important}} risk management tools widely used by financial institutions, including insurers. Insurers rely on derivatives for managing actuarial, market, credit {{as well as}} liquidity risks. There is lack of knowledge and publication about the recent use of derivatives by insurers. This paper attempts {{to fill the gap}} in the literature. Design/methodology/approach – The paper analyses data based on <b>statutory</b> <b>company</b> filings with state regulators in the USA. Findings – The analysis suggests that derivatives are used by larger companies, especially in the life insurance industry. This could be explained by the significant economies of scale that are possible when using derivatives. Smaller firms do not have the resources to invest in the latest risk management technologies, and management may be uncomfortable using such new tools. Surveys and anecdotal evidence also suggest that, for insurance companies, the lack of familiarity with the regulatory and accounting treatment of derivatives is another reason for their cautious derivative usage. Originality/value – The main value of the paper is the analysis of derivative usage by insurers based on recent data. The brief description of accounting and regulatory issues concerning insurance industry usage of derivatives, provided in the paper, would be useful to managers in insurance companies considering use of derivatives. The paper would also be useful to market participants interested in providing derivative-based solutions to insurance companies.

40|$|Entitlements from {{old-age pension}} schemes - <b>statutory,</b> <b>company,</b> and private - {{represent}} a considerable source of wealth. For data-related reasons, {{analyses of the}} personal wealth distribution have so far failed to take this into account, however. According to recent calculations based on the 2007 data of the German Socio- Economic Panel (SOEP), {{the present value of}} total pension and state annuity entitlements (not including entitlements to provision for dependants) amounted to roughly 4. 6 trillion euros. This corresponds to an average of 67, 000 euros per adult. When this is combined with individuals' financial and material assets, which amount to an average of 88, 000 euros, the result is a more comprehensive total net worth of more than 155, 000 euros. Civil servants and retired civil servants fare better than average if this larger view is taken. This more comprehensive measurement shows considerably less inequality of wealth than traditional analyses, which refer only to financial and material assets. This is not least because of the very widespread existence of entitlements under the various old-age pension schemes with simultaneous capping based on the contribution assessment threshold for statutory pension schemes. Nevertheless, wealth continues to be highly concentrated, and the mitigating effects of old-age pension assets will likely become less important in the future. Here the effects of falling pension levels as a result of reforms in the old-age pension systems and growing gaps in earnings histories will be felt - with the risk of increasing poverty among the future elderly.

40|$|In 1889 the South Metropolitan Gas Company set up {{a profit}} sharing scheme. This was instituted {{in the same year}} as the Gas Workers Union and a {{concurrent}} dispute in South Met. 's works. The scheme and its relationship to unionisation need to be explored. Throughout its history the gas industry had been engaged in a dialogue about its policies on profit and price with both central and local government. Within the London gas industry South Met., under a management dominated by George Livesey after 1871, had an innovatory and often contentious role. The profit sharing scheme continued and flourished in South Mat. and was widely copied throughout the industry. A consultative process was set up which was extended to cover direct elections to the Board by the workforce. The scheme was used by the Company {{in such a way as}} to impose a discipline on the workers which was designed not only to limit their behaviour in the workplace but to incorporate them into the property owning structure and the prevailing value system. In a wider setting it can be seen as an attempt by a <b>statutory</b> <b>Company</b> to alter its nature within the context of the joint stock system to extend its base so as to meet criticisms concerning the private ownership of a public utility. This thesis will argue that George Livesey's concern with the conflicts of society as he saw them led him to use the mechanism of the sliding scale, originally concerned with gas pricing, to build what he saw as a partnership between capitalists, customers and workers...|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 24). I am Mahbuba Akhtary (11104111) of BRAC University. I have done my internship at Investment corporation of Bangladesh, <b>statutory</b> <b>company</b> of Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. My internship is in the Human Research (HR) department. Throughout my internship, I had been working in different sectors in ICB. The report is the outcome of 66 working days long internship program that I had successfully completed at ICB. I have done this because of the requirement to finish my BBA program. Each and every hour spent in the ICB, it opens a new world in front of me. And the world is more exciting, full of challenges as well as responsibilities. The work experience I’ve got is so precious {{to me and my}} future career. Title of the Internship Report is “Job Satisfaction of employee at ICB” and Objectives of the Internship are to understand the satisfaction level of an employee, formulating strategies for employee’s need, his career build up and his/her decision making capabilities. Methodologies used for achieving these objectives are data analysis and feedback from the various employees. For achieving first three objectives, I have done employee survey at ICB, collecting their opinions, collaborating these with the present situation and finally make a comparison statement in between present job facilities at corporate level with the exiting employee facilities at ICB. Main findings of this internship are given here. Employees can be categorized broadly into three heading and that is highly skilled, moderate skilled and fresh/ new comer. Different employee’s satisfaction level depends on how he could perform in that environment and sometimes, how he has been treated in the company. The outcome of this internship is that, though more facilities and collaboration of new instrument may accelerate the job satisfaction but ultimately it the employee himself who has to take part to satisfy his/her job.

40|$|The {{consensus}} among legal and economic historians that British law between 1844 and 1914 provided little protection to corporate shareholders {{is based on}} formal provisions in the Companies Acts. In fact these Acts applied only to companies registered by the Board of Trade. Moreover corporate law for <b>statutory</b> <b>companies</b> was codified in the Companies Clauses Consolidation Act of 1845. We show that, while the governance rules of private companies were largely unconstrained, {{for most of the}} Victorian period most capital in quoted companies (which were mainly statutory) scored highly on the "anti-director" rights index under mandatory rules. When registered companies came to dominate stock exchanges, nearer {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, they voluntarily adopted similar rules, which professionals serving the stock exchange and IPOs recognised had advantages for raising capital. The main exception was the omission of tiered voting rules (whose record in protecting minorities was at best debatable), in favour of one-share-one-vote. Unlike the prevailing consensus, our reinterpretation is consistent with evidence on the large size of the London Stock Exchange and extensive divorce of ownership from control in listed UK companies before 1914...|$|R
