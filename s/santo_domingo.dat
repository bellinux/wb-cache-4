5|$|In 1869, Grant {{proposed}} to annex the independent largely black nation of the Dominican Republic, {{then known as}} <b>Santo</b> <b>Domingo.</b> Previously in 1868, President Andrew Johnson had attempted to annex the Dominican Republic and <b>Santo</b> <b>Domingo,</b> but the House of Representatives defeated two resolutions {{for the protection of}} the Dominican Republic and <b>Santo</b> <b>Domingo</b> and for the annexation of the Dominican Republic. In July, 1869 Grant sent Orville E. Babcock and Rufus Ingalls who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic President Buenaventura Báez for the annexation of <b>Santo</b> <b>Domingo</b> to the United States and the sale of Samaná Bay for $2million. To keep the island nation and Báez secure in power, Grant ordered naval ships, unauthorized by Congress, to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection. Báez signed an annexation treaty on November 19, 1869 offered by Babcock under federal State department authorization. Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $1.5million to the Dominican national debt, the annexation of <b>Santo</b> <b>Domingo</b> as an American state, the United States' acquisition of the rights for Samaná Bay for 50 years with an annual $150,000 rental, and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention. On January 10, 1870 the <b>Santo</b> <b>Domingo</b> treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification. Despite his support of the annexation, Grant made the mistakes of not informing Congress of the treaty or encouraging national acceptance and enthusiasm.|$|E

Col. Rafael Conti organized a military expedition with the intention of defending the Dominican Republic. They were successful and were proclaimed as heroes by the Spanish Government.|$|E

5|$|Pedro Moreno, {{sent from}} the Audiencia of <b>Santo</b> <b>Domingo</b> in Hispaniola, arrived in Honduras {{shortly after the}} {{founding}} of Trujillo. He found forty colonists in a desperate state, lacking weapons and provisions. A few more Spaniards were still at Nito, the remnants of González Dávila's men, where their plight was even worse. The residents of Trujillo pleaded with Moreno for assistance, which he granted on condition that they renounced Cortés, accepted {{the jurisdiction of the}} Audiencia of <b>Santo</b> <b>Domingo,</b> and agreed to take Juan Ruano, one of Olid's former officers, as Chief Magistrate. Moreno renamed Trujillo as Ascensión, and he sent messages to Hernández de Córdoba, who was in Nicaragua, asking him to renounce his loyalty to Pedrarias and pledge allegiance to <b>Santo</b> <b>Domingo.</b> Moreno then returned to Hispaniola, promising to send aid. As soon as he was gone, the residents restored the name of Trujillo, pledged their allegiance once more to Cortés, and expelled Juan Ruano.|$|E

5|$|Both of the {{principal}} French squadrons departed Brest on 13 December, remaining {{together for the first}} two days before dividing in pursuit of separate British merchant convoys on 15 December.

The voyage was long and difficult, Leissègues struggling through winter storms that divided his squadron and inflicted severe damage to his ships. Arriving at <b>Santo</b> <b>Domingo</b> on 20 January, Leissègues disembarked his troops and began extensive repairs to his ships in preparation for raiding cruises in the Caribbean.|$|E

5|$|After Cerezeda took {{most of the}} {{inhabitants}} of Trujillo into Higueras, the city entered a period of serious decline.

5|$|Contre-Admiral Leissègues' {{squadron}} was unchanged {{from the}} force that left Brest on 13 December. All ships however, especially Jupiter and Diomède, had been badly damaged by storms off the Azores in late December and repairs were incomplete {{by the time of}} Duckworth's attack, most the fleet still undergoing caulking at <b>Santo</b> <b>Domingo.</b> Recognising that if he was caught at anchor he would be destroyed, Leissègues sent orders from his offices in <b>Santo</b> <b>Domingo</b> for the fleet to sail, joining them later by small boat. Trapped against the land with the wind from the west, Leissègues had no option but to form a line of battle and wait to meet the British squadron. Although his ships fought hard, they were unable to mutually support one another and were rapidly overwhelmed: three surrendered, while Diomède and Impérial were driven ashore and wrecked to prevent their capture. The only ships to escape were the two frigates and a corvette that and slipped between the French line and the land early in the battle and made sail to the west, eventually reaching France.|$|E

50|$|The {{population}} of the Spanish colony stood at approximately 80,000 with the vast majority being European descendants and free people of color. <b>Santo</b> <b>Domingo's</b> plantation economy never truly flourished, because of this the black slave population had been significantly {{lower than that of}} the neighboring Saint-Domingue, which was nearing a million slaves before the Haitian Revolution.|$|R
50|$|The Spaniards’ {{awareness}} of the black auxiliaries’ “natural savagery” as well as <b>Santo</b> <b>Domingo’s</b> cession to France in the Peace Treaty of Basel, persuaded them {{to get rid of}} Jean-François and his troops, since the circumstances that had justified their alliance to the former slaves, that is, Spain’s plan to conquer the western part of Hispaniola, had failed.|$|R
