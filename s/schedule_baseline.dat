50|$|One {{possible}} {{method to}} maximize solution robustness is to include {{safety in the}} <b>baseline</b> <b>schedule</b> in order to absorb the anticipated disruptions.

A second approach, termed reactive scheduling, consists of defining a procedure to react to disruptions that cannot be absorbed by the <b>baseline</b> <b>schedule.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of publications in the extensive literature on resource-constrained project scheduling {{focus on a}} static deterministic setting for which a so-called <b>baseline</b> <b>schedule</b> is computed prior to project execution.

During the actual execution of a project, the <b>baseline</b> <b>schedule</b> may indeed suffer from disruptive events causing the actually realized activity start times to deviate from the predicted baseline start times. This tutorial focuses on robust project scheduling, in particular the development of effective and efficient proactive and reactive scheduling procedures. Proactive scheduling aims at generating robust <b>baseline</b> <b>schedules</b> that carry sufficient protection against possible schedule disruptions that may occur during project execution. Reactive scheduling procedures aim at repairing the <b>baseline</b> <b>schedule</b> when the built-in protection fails during the execution of the project.

40|$|This is {{the first}} {{revision}} of the Project Decision Schedule (PDS) for the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program. The status date for milestones in the PDS is as of April 1991. This revision replaces the original PDS issued in March 1986. The PDS, which is required by Section 114 (e) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) of 1982, as amended, is to portray the optimum way to attain {{the operation of the}} repository. The PDS includes a description of objectives and a sequence of deadlines for all Federal agencies that are required to take action in achieving this goal. The activity deadlines in this issue of the PDS are based on the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987 and the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management`s Program <b>Schedule</b> <b>Baseline.</b> The Program <b>Schedule</b> <b>Baseline</b> supports the Secretary of Energy`s Report to Congress on Reassessment of the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program, November 1989. That report, among other things, contains the results of a comprehensive review of the schedule for repository-related activities, including a realistic assessment of activity durations and past experience. This schedule shows a significant slip for the expected start of repository operations [...] from the year 2003 to approximately 2010. To promote the Department of Energy`s ability to achieve the new milestones and goals, the Secretary of Energy announced an action plan that centers on gaining access to the Yucca Mountain candidate site to continue the scientific investigations needed to evaluate the site`s suitability for a repository and on establishing integrated Monitored Retrievable Storage with a target for spent fuel acceptance in 1998. 5 figs., 6 tabs...|$|E

40|$|The {{well-known}} deterministic resource-constrained {{project scheduling}} problem (RCPSP) involves {{the determination of}} a predictive <b>schedule</b> (<b>baseline</b> schedule or pre-schedule) of the project activities that satisfies the finish-start precedence relations and the renewable resource constraints under the objective of minimizing the project duration. This pre-schedule serves as a baseline for {{the execution of the}} project. During execution, however, the project can be subject to several types of disruptions that may disturb the baseline schedule. Management must then rely on a reactive scheduling procedure for revising or reoptimizing the pre-schedule. The objective of our research is to develop procedures for allocating resources to the activities of a given baseline schedule in order to maximize its stability. We propose two integer programming based heuristics and report on computational results obtained on a set of benchmark problems. ...|$|E

40|$|Four rhesus monkeys {{were trained}} on a non-discriminated shock-avoidance <b>schedule</b> (<b>baseline).</b> Stimuli {{followed}} by response-independent shock were then {{presented with the}} avoidance baseline no longer in effect. The main portion of the experiment consisted of superimposing (independently of responding) the stimuli followed by response-independent shock on the avoidance baseline. Different temporal values of stimulus duration and delay of shock (produced by an avoidance response) were presented successively, using each subject as his own control. When the stimulus duration was short or the delay of shock was long, so that avoidance rate during the stimulus could assume any value without resulting in baseline (avoidable) shocks during the stimulus, a lowered or “suppressed” rate of responding developed during the stimulus. When the stimulus duration was long or the delay of shock was brief, so that avoidable shocks resulted from a response decrement during the stimulus, high or “facilitated” rates of responding developed for {{a large proportion of}} the time that the stimulus was present...|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of research efforts in project scheduling assume a static and deterministic environment with complete information. In practice, however, these assumptions will hardly, if ever, be satisfied. Proactive scheduling aims at {{the generation of}} robust <b>baseline</b> <b>schedules</b> that are {{as much as possible}} protected against anticipated disruptions that may occur during project execution. In this paper, we focus on disruptions that may be caused by stochastic resource availabilities and aim at generating stable <b>baseline</b> <b>schedules,</b> where the solution robustness (stability) of the <b>baseline</b> <b>schedule</b> is measured by the weighted deviation between the planned and the actually realized activity starting times during project execution. We present a tabu search procedure that operates on a surrogate free slack based objective function.
